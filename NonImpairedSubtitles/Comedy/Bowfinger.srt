<i>Bowfinger International Pictures.</i>

2
00:01:59,794 --> 00:02:01,546
<i>This is Cherisse from AT&T.</i>

3
00:02:01,674 --> 00:02:05,553
<i>We're wondering if your payment</i>
<i>for $5.43 has gone astray. Call us.</i>

4
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:06,949
<i>Just a reminder.</i>

5
00:02:07,034 --> 00:02:10,663
<i>We no longer need access to</i>
<i>your residence to disconnect your phone.</i>

6
00:02:57,834 --> 00:02:59,631
Great script.

7
00:03:13,394 --> 00:03:15,669
Betsy, it's now or never.

8
00:03:16,994 --> 00:03:18,905
We are gonna make a movie.

9
00:03:18,994 --> 00:03:21,986
<i>- Bowfinger International Pictures.</i>
<i>- It's Carol.</i>

10
00:03:22,314 --> 00:03:26,102
<i>How do I say this? I have an offer</i>
<i>to go to Edmonton to do</i> Cats.

11
00:03:26,314 --> 00:03:28,430
<i>It's a small role, but I've got to take it.</i>

12
00:03:28,514 --> 00:03:30,550
<i>- You keep promising me...</i>
- No!

13
00:03:30,914 --> 00:03:33,587
<i>...but it's been 8 months.</i>
- Carol, don't take that job.

14
00:03:33,674 --> 00:03:36,063
We're gonna make a motion picture.
I promise you.

15
00:03:36,154 --> 00:03:38,588
<i>- But you've promised before.</i>
- I know.

16
00:03:38,674 --> 00:03:41,108
- Be here tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.
<i>- I can't afford...</i>

17
00:03:41,194 --> 00:03:43,105
- Please!
<i>- But you always...</i>

18
00:03:50,234 --> 00:03:52,190
<i>This is Dave. Beep comin'.</i>

19
00:03:52,954 --> 00:03:55,229
Dave, can you get me
a Mercedes tomorrow?

20
00:03:55,314 --> 00:03:58,704
I want you to find out when
and where Jerry Renfro is having lunch.

21
00:03:58,794 --> 00:04:01,672
Just do it. Don't think about it.
You're my buddy.

22
00:04:08,474 --> 00:04:09,702
Come on.

23
00:04:11,114 --> 00:04:14,345
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Afrim? It's Bowfinger. Great script.

24
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:17,593
You wrote a great script.
Your accounting days are over.

25
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,710
<i>He likes my script!</i>

26
00:04:21,354 --> 00:04:22,787
Afrim? Afrim?

27
00:04:23,154 --> 00:04:25,873
- Be here tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.
<i>- Yes, Boss.</i>

28
00:04:39,074 --> 00:04:40,427
- Slater.
<i>- Who is this?</i>

29
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:41,833
- Bowfinger.
<i>- 'Bye.</i>

30
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:44,633
Don't hang up. Be here tomorrow at 10:00.

31
00:04:45,674 --> 00:04:48,984
<i>- That's early.</i>
- Big meeting, 10:00 a.m. Please?

32
00:05:03,194 --> 00:05:05,389
You believe in me, don't you, Betsy?

33
00:05:32,434 --> 00:05:34,584
First of all, thank you for coming.

34
00:05:35,994 --> 00:05:38,462
I know things have been a little slow.

35
00:05:38,554 --> 00:05:40,988
- Very slow.
- Slow and low.

36
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,348
Let him speak.

37
00:05:42,994 --> 00:05:45,952
We are not the big guys.
We are the little guys.

38
00:05:46,034 --> 00:05:49,583
We never had muscle before,
but now we do.

39
00:05:49,714 --> 00:05:52,182
Because last night I read a screenplay...

40
00:05:52,314 --> 00:05:54,748
...that every studio in town
is going to want.

41
00:05:54,834 --> 00:05:57,906
And how did we get this screenplay?
Because Afrim here...

42
00:05:57,994 --> 00:06:01,907
...is a damn fine writer,
and accountant and part-time receptionist.

43
00:06:02,234 --> 00:06:05,749
I said, "Afrim, if you can write
as well as you can add..."

44
00:06:05,874 --> 00:06:08,024
I didn't have to finish my sentence.

45
00:06:08,114 --> 00:06:12,471
Twelve days later
he hands me this masterpiece.

46
00:06:13,114 --> 00:06:14,672
Thank you, Boss.

47
00:06:15,234 --> 00:06:16,872
Tell them the title.

48
00:06:16,994 --> 00:06:18,393
<i>Chubby Rain.</i>

49
00:06:19,314 --> 00:06:20,144
What?

50
00:06:20,234 --> 00:06:22,145
<i>Chubby Rain.</i> Tell them why.

51
00:06:22,234 --> 00:06:26,386
- The aliens come to Earth in raindrops.
- Yeah!

52
00:06:27,314 --> 00:06:29,384
Making the raindrops chubby.

53
00:06:29,594 --> 00:06:32,666
Aliens in the raindrops.
At the end of this movie...

54
00:06:32,794 --> 00:06:36,912
...when our hero, Keith Kincaid,
looks up at the alien antenna and says:

55
00:06:37,234 --> 00:06:38,792
"Gotcha, suckers!"

56
00:06:40,994 --> 00:06:43,064
I mean, that is a moment.

57
00:06:46,154 --> 00:06:47,303
I don't know.

58
00:06:47,394 --> 00:06:51,069
I'll close the deal today.
If I don't, you can go anywhere you want.

59
00:06:55,194 --> 00:06:56,468
Come here.

60
00:07:01,834 --> 00:07:03,552
See that FedEx truck?

61
00:07:08,754 --> 00:07:11,951
Every day, it delivers important papers
to people around the world.

62
00:07:12,034 --> 00:07:14,389
And one day, it is going to stop here...

63
00:07:14,474 --> 00:07:19,104
...a man is going to walk up and casually
toss a couple of FedExes on my desk.

64
00:07:19,354 --> 00:07:21,231
And at that moment, we...

65
00:07:21,354 --> 00:07:24,266
...and by "we" I mean "me,"
will be important.

66
00:07:27,034 --> 00:07:28,308
Now, today...

67
00:07:28,394 --> 00:07:31,750
...I have a very important meeting
with Jerry Renfro.

68
00:07:32,954 --> 00:07:37,630
If it goes the way I think it's gonna go,
I will see you at the Oscars.

69
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:36,188
Good job, Dave.

70
00:08:36,274 --> 00:08:38,663
Return it in 45 minutes.
I'm supposed to wash it.

71
00:08:38,754 --> 00:08:39,823
Has Renfro left?

72
00:08:39,914 --> 00:08:42,747
Fifteen minutes ago.
He should be at the restaurant now.

73
00:08:42,834 --> 00:08:45,507
If this goes like I think,
I'm making you cameraman.

74
00:08:45,594 --> 00:08:46,709
Know what that means?

75
00:08:46,794 --> 00:08:49,786
- You'd be living up to your promise?
- That's right.

76
00:08:50,194 --> 00:08:53,504
If this movie gets made,
I'm giving you my van.

77
00:08:56,754 --> 00:08:58,187
It is my van.

78
00:09:35,914 --> 00:09:39,145
Could you seat me next to Jerry Renfro?
Thank you.

79
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:42,113
Tony, how are you?

80
00:09:43,234 --> 00:09:45,111
No. Say the deal back to me.

81
00:09:45,514 --> 00:09:46,708
Net net?

82
00:09:46,914 --> 00:09:49,474
If I'm putting $85 million
into an avalanche movie...

83
00:09:49,554 --> 00:09:52,591
...I gotta know where the snow is.
And it better be Aspen.

84
00:09:52,674 --> 00:09:54,551
And what asshole will direct.

85
00:09:54,634 --> 00:09:57,148
We gotta get a director. Get me a list.

86
00:09:57,234 --> 00:10:00,909
- The star has to be international.
- I need an international star.

87
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:05,032
- Who's my star?
- How about Kit Ramsey?

88
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:08,585
Kit Ramsey is the hottest,
sexiest action star in the world.

89
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:12,428
When I think of Kit Ramsey in this movie,
I get very comfortable.

90
00:10:12,514 --> 00:10:14,948
Yeah, but I won't bid
against Flanehfastah...

91
00:10:15,034 --> 00:10:18,868
...because even if Kit Ramsey's interested,
we might not want him.

92
00:10:19,874 --> 00:10:23,708
Can you believe this? Now they try
to tell us who's gonna be in our movies.

93
00:10:23,794 --> 00:10:26,069
Get me Kit. Get me Kit right now.

94
00:10:27,194 --> 00:10:29,754
You don't put me on hold,
I put you on hold.

95
00:10:29,834 --> 00:10:32,302
Put me on hold and you're a dead man.

96
00:10:33,554 --> 00:10:35,909
How are you? Bobby Bowfinger,
Bowfinger Films.

97
00:10:35,994 --> 00:10:38,827
- We worked on that thing years ago.
- What thing?

98
00:10:38,954 --> 00:10:40,945
The... famous movie.

99
00:10:43,114 --> 00:10:45,469
Hi, Kit. How are you?

100
00:10:45,994 --> 00:10:48,428
My man! How's Dolores?

101
00:10:49,154 --> 00:10:52,191
Good. You are first in line for the script.

102
00:10:52,674 --> 00:10:55,746
- You can't be more first than first.
- Can I talk to him?

103
00:10:56,514 --> 00:11:00,302
- Can I talk to Kit?
- Absolutely. Kit?

104
00:11:00,954 --> 00:11:04,583
Got a surprise for you. Kit?
I'm losing you...

105
00:11:05,794 --> 00:11:08,388
- Bad line?
- These cell phones are so bad.

106
00:11:08,474 --> 00:11:10,783
Universal's begging me for this script.

107
00:11:10,874 --> 00:11:14,105
They screwed me once.
You ought to take a look.

108
00:11:17,914 --> 00:11:20,474
- It starts nice.
- It does, doesn't it?

109
00:11:20,594 --> 00:11:22,505
- All this.
- Yeah. Right.

110
00:11:24,034 --> 00:11:27,709
- "Gotcha, suckers!" That is a catch phrase.
- Isn't that good?

111
00:11:28,074 --> 00:11:29,871
I just saw the poster.

112
00:11:31,114 --> 00:11:33,582
Let's be risky today. I'm going with this.

113
00:11:33,674 --> 00:11:37,986
You bring me this script and Kit Ramsey
and you got yourself a go picture, Bobby.

114
00:11:39,594 --> 00:11:41,027
Okay. Thanks.

115
00:11:45,274 --> 00:11:47,663
I love what you do. Here's my card.

116
00:11:49,674 --> 00:11:51,392
Just keep that.

117
00:11:55,634 --> 00:11:56,828
What was that?

118
00:11:56,914 --> 00:11:59,872
"A go picture! A go picture!"

119
00:12:01,234 --> 00:12:03,464
Do you know anyone who knows
Kit Ramsey?

120
00:12:03,834 --> 00:12:06,394
Damn it! I'm the biggest black
action star in the world!

121
00:12:06,474 --> 00:12:09,034
- Where's my <i>"Hasta la vista,</i> baby"?
- What?

122
00:12:09,114 --> 00:12:12,823
If Arnold Schwarnzen-cracker
is gettin' to say lines like that...

123
00:12:12,954 --> 00:12:15,627
...then I deserve equally well-written shit.

124
00:12:15,914 --> 00:12:18,064
- The script has that moment.
- When?

125
00:12:18,234 --> 00:12:22,705
You say, "I enjoyed meeting you, Cliff."
Then you push the guy right over the cliff.

126
00:12:22,794 --> 00:12:27,345
But the audience has to know
the guy's name is Cliff, and he's on a cliff.

127
00:12:27,474 --> 00:12:30,386
It's too cerebral. We're trying
to make a movie, not a film.

128
00:12:30,474 --> 00:12:32,465
You're supposed to be the agent!

129
00:12:32,634 --> 00:12:35,706
You better find me a line
like the time I told Tommy Lee Jones...

130
00:12:35,794 --> 00:12:37,705
..."Fuck you," and blew his brains out.

131
00:12:37,794 --> 00:12:39,466
You know what's happening?

132
00:12:39,594 --> 00:12:43,143
Another example of the white man
taking all the best catch phrases...

133
00:12:43,234 --> 00:12:45,464
...and then giving them
to Arnold or Stallone.

134
00:12:45,554 --> 00:12:48,022
Exactly. And Jackie Chan and Van Damme.

135
00:12:48,154 --> 00:12:50,270
They can't even speak English good.

136
00:12:50,434 --> 00:12:53,790
There's covert stuff goin' on.
Some covert shit I just found out.

137
00:12:53,874 --> 00:12:56,069
I'm glad you're here. Come in here.

138
00:12:56,154 --> 00:12:57,985
Right now, everybody. Come here.

139
00:12:58,074 --> 00:13:00,508
- What you talkin' about?
- Just for fun...

140
00:13:00,594 --> 00:13:04,348
...I scanned the script to see
how many times the letter "K" appears.

141
00:13:06,354 --> 00:13:09,710
The letter "K" appears
in this script 1,456 times.

142
00:13:09,834 --> 00:13:11,790
That's perfectly divisible by three.

143
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,263
- So what're you saying?
- What am I sayin'?

144
00:13:14,354 --> 00:13:17,585
"KKK" appears in this script 486 times.

145
00:13:25,354 --> 00:13:27,663
- The sickness is deep.
- He's playing you.

146
00:13:27,754 --> 00:13:30,348
- I've been played.
- That's really not the case here.

147
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:33,824
This is a great script.
It's not Shakespeare, but...

148
00:13:33,954 --> 00:13:37,663
- What'd you just say?
- I said, "It's not Shakespeare, but..."

149
00:13:37,754 --> 00:13:40,143
It's not... Did you hear what he's doing?

150
00:13:40,234 --> 00:13:43,306
He's doing something.
I just can't put my finger on it.

151
00:13:43,394 --> 00:13:44,907
What's he doing?

152
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,224
- Shakespeare, Freddy.
- Shakespeare!

153
00:13:47,434 --> 00:13:50,312
- "Shake-a-spear. Spear-chucker."
- "Shake-a-spear!"

154
00:13:50,434 --> 00:13:52,152
I'm a spear-chucker now.

155
00:13:52,234 --> 00:13:54,702
- Call me a spear-chucker.
- It doesn't mean that!

156
00:13:54,794 --> 00:13:56,671
It's my imagination?

157
00:13:56,874 --> 00:13:59,388
There's no computer chip
in LaToya Jackson's brain.

158
00:13:59,474 --> 00:14:02,546
She just acts like that.
Teddy Kennedy ain't 1/16 black.

159
00:14:02,714 --> 00:14:05,911
- Teddy Kennedy?
- He's different to the other Kennedys.

160
00:14:05,994 --> 00:14:09,873
- I got some calls to make.
- Go make some calls. Call Arnold and Sly!

161
00:14:09,994 --> 00:14:13,748
And Van Damme and Jackie Chan.
Tell 'em the spear-chucker said hello!

162
00:14:51,194 --> 00:14:53,628
Get my door just as fast
as you get Tom Hanks'!

163
00:14:53,714 --> 00:14:56,865
- Wait. Who are you?
- Script delivery from Paramount.

164
00:14:56,994 --> 00:14:59,952
- I ain't expectin' no script from Paramount.
- I mean Universal.

165
00:15:00,034 --> 00:15:02,753
- Maybe so. Come on.
- Gotta have you sign.

166
00:15:03,074 --> 00:15:06,749
- I ain't signing shit.
- It's all good. This script is butter.

167
00:15:06,834 --> 00:15:09,394
- What?
- Butter, butter. This stuff is butter.

168
00:15:10,154 --> 00:15:12,907
It's all good. It's jiggy baby.

169
00:15:12,994 --> 00:15:15,189
How you know it's all good and jiggy baby?

170
00:15:15,274 --> 00:15:17,868
- I was reading it on the way over.
- You read my script?

171
00:15:17,954 --> 00:15:20,593
I loved this script 'cause
it's a twist on the usual.

172
00:15:20,674 --> 00:15:23,791
- It's science fiction, which we know sells...
- You shut up.

173
00:15:23,874 --> 00:15:26,468
I'll whip your ass.
You don't be reading my stuff.

174
00:15:26,554 --> 00:15:29,352
- Get off the property!
- I just got a little excited.

175
00:15:29,434 --> 00:15:31,823
I gotta get over to my MindHead meeting.

176
00:15:32,874 --> 00:15:34,068
MindHead?

177
00:15:34,954 --> 00:15:37,468
- MindHead?
- MindHead! You need a lift?

178
00:15:38,074 --> 00:15:41,111
- I can't believe that!
- Yeah! Come on in.

179
00:15:41,394 --> 00:15:42,986
- Thank you.
- What a coincidence!

180
00:15:43,074 --> 00:15:45,065
- Who's your guide?
- Terry Stricter. Yours?

181
00:15:45,154 --> 00:15:46,872
- Ray.
- Ray?

182
00:16:05,274 --> 00:16:08,311
It's people like you
that give MindHead a bad name!

183
00:16:08,394 --> 00:16:10,225
You lying sack of shit!

184
00:16:12,434 --> 00:16:15,665
Read the script.
I'm really a big-time producer with clout.

185
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:29,945
<i>Welcome to MindHead.</i>

186
00:16:31,434 --> 00:16:33,629
<i>Welcome to MindHead.</i>

187
00:16:44,554 --> 00:16:47,227
Seems as though
you're doing much better.

188
00:16:48,314 --> 00:16:50,623
- Yes. Yes.
- Your paranoia...

189
00:16:51,074 --> 00:16:54,464
...is definitely under control
since you came to understand...

190
00:16:54,794 --> 00:16:56,625
...Happy Premise Number One.

191
00:16:57,434 --> 00:17:00,392
Happy Premise Number One:
There are no aliens.

192
00:17:00,794 --> 00:17:02,466
Happy Premise Number Two.

193
00:17:02,754 --> 00:17:06,508
Happy Premise Number Two:
There is no giant foot trying to squash me.

194
00:17:06,634 --> 00:17:08,386
Happy Premise Number Three.

195
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:12,348
Happy Premise Number Three:
Even though I feel like I might ignite...

196
00:17:12,634 --> 00:17:14,192
...I probably won't.

197
00:17:14,474 --> 00:17:16,032
What do we do?

198
00:17:19,874 --> 00:17:21,626
Keep it together.

199
00:17:21,754 --> 00:17:24,109
Keep it together. Keep it together.

200
00:17:24,234 --> 00:17:27,749
And what is it we don't do
under any circumstances?

201
00:17:28,834 --> 00:17:30,790
- Oh, man!
- What is it?

202
00:17:31,394 --> 00:17:33,749
I have to show it to the Laker Girls.

203
00:17:33,874 --> 00:17:36,149
You cannot show it to the Laker Girls.

204
00:17:36,954 --> 00:17:39,832
Keep Mr. Weenie in the pants.

205
00:17:40,274 --> 00:17:41,946
Always in the pants.

206
00:17:42,234 --> 00:17:44,589
I know you want to show it
to the Laker Girls...

207
00:17:44,674 --> 00:17:47,427
...but you must never show it
to the Laker Girls.

208
00:18:20,074 --> 00:18:21,871
What did he say?

209
00:18:23,754 --> 00:18:25,312
Betsy, come here.

210
00:18:26,274 --> 00:18:28,230
Sit! Come.

211
00:18:29,154 --> 00:18:30,189
Sit!

212
00:18:31,714 --> 00:18:35,070
Good girl! Come here. What a good girl.

213
00:18:35,194 --> 00:18:37,833
- Is she amazing, or what?
- What did he say?

214
00:18:42,194 --> 00:18:45,345
I'm at the meeting with Jerry Renfro,
and it's going very well.

215
00:18:45,434 --> 00:18:49,712
But, I'm looking at him and I'm thinking,
I don't need him.

216
00:18:50,194 --> 00:18:52,947
What I need is someone like a Kit Ramsey.

217
00:18:53,034 --> 00:18:55,912
Kit Ramsey makes this a go picture.

218
00:18:56,074 --> 00:18:59,544
- So, I went to see Kit at his home.
- My God.

219
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:03,193
What did he say?

220
00:19:04,874 --> 00:19:07,388
- What did who say?
- What did Kit Ramsey say?

221
00:19:09,754 --> 00:19:14,669
I'm meeting with Kit at his home...
By the way, he knew who I was.

222
00:19:15,514 --> 00:19:18,267
I gave him the script,
and he looked through the script.

223
00:19:18,354 --> 00:19:22,393
And I said, "So, what do you think?
Are you interested in doing this movie?"

224
00:19:26,354 --> 00:19:28,185
Kit looked at me...

225
00:19:30,674 --> 00:19:31,868
...he said...

226
00:19:38,474 --> 00:19:41,227
Kit, just...

227
00:19:43,634 --> 00:19:44,783
...said:

228
00:19:48,274 --> 00:19:49,309
"Yes."

229
00:19:54,554 --> 00:19:56,431
Kit Ramsey said yes?

230
00:19:57,474 --> 00:20:00,989
Kit Ramsey is doing this movie!

231
00:20:13,274 --> 00:20:16,823
- You told them we'd make this movie?
- That's right, I did.

232
00:20:16,994 --> 00:20:19,633
- You have to tell them.
- Tell them what?

233
00:20:19,714 --> 00:20:23,468
- We're not gonna make the movie.
- Dave, I made them a promise.

234
00:20:23,794 --> 00:20:26,627
How will you make the movie
with Kit Ramsey? He said no.

235
00:20:26,714 --> 00:20:29,103
You don't think I worked that out?

236
00:20:29,274 --> 00:20:31,993
We'll make the movie
with Kit Ramsey, except...

237
00:20:32,114 --> 00:20:34,753
- Except what?
- Except he won't know he's in it.

238
00:20:36,714 --> 00:20:37,749
What?

239
00:20:38,434 --> 00:20:40,550
We secretly follow him around
with a camera.

240
00:20:40,634 --> 00:20:42,909
Our actors walk up to him
and say their lines.

241
00:20:42,994 --> 00:20:45,554
And he's in our movie,
and we don't have to pay him.

242
00:20:45,634 --> 00:20:49,422
- What's he gonna say?
- What difference does it make?

243
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:52,108
It's an action movie.
All he's gotta do is run.

244
00:20:52,194 --> 00:20:55,266
He runs away from the aliens,
he runs toward the aliens.

245
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:57,231
I want to show you something.

246
00:20:58,514 --> 00:21:00,823
Got this all worked out, I think.

247
00:21:02,754 --> 00:21:05,393
There are six major scenes with Kit.
The ones in red.

248
00:21:05,474 --> 00:21:07,226
He's not in any of the other scenes...

249
00:21:07,314 --> 00:21:10,306
...so we just shoot those
with our own actors on our own time.

250
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,589
Bingo, we've got a movie.

251
00:21:13,114 --> 00:21:14,263
That's crazy.

252
00:21:15,554 --> 00:21:17,272
But we're desperate.

253
00:21:17,634 --> 00:21:20,990
Why don't you wait till you get a star
who wants to be in it?

254
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:22,872
I'm 49 years old.

255
00:21:23,114 --> 00:21:27,232
Admittedly, I could get away
with 44, 41, maybe 38.

256
00:21:27,554 --> 00:21:29,988
But when you hit 50,
they don't hire you anymore.

257
00:21:30,074 --> 00:21:32,144
It's like they can smell 50.

258
00:21:32,274 --> 00:21:33,593
What's that?

259
00:21:36,114 --> 00:21:38,423
When I was 10,
I knew I wanted to make movies...

260
00:21:38,514 --> 00:21:40,744
...but I knew no one
was going to give me that.

261
00:21:40,834 --> 00:21:44,190
So I started putting away
one dollar every week of my life.

262
00:21:44,394 --> 00:21:47,830
If I missed a week, I made it up later,
from age 10 on.

263
00:21:48,634 --> 00:21:52,468
And now, you're looking at enough
to get us started.

264
00:21:52,714 --> 00:21:54,511
$2,184.

265
00:21:56,274 --> 00:21:58,583
But movies cost millions of dollars
to make.

266
00:21:58,674 --> 00:22:02,030
That's after gross net deduction
profit percentage...

267
00:22:02,394 --> 00:22:04,828
...deferment ten percent of the nut.

268
00:22:05,234 --> 00:22:07,873
Cash? Every movie costs $2,184.

269
00:22:27,594 --> 00:22:29,789
Where do I go to be an actress?

270
00:23:04,354 --> 00:23:06,424
Okay. That was nice.

271
00:23:06,514 --> 00:23:09,108
We have your photos,
and we'll call you when we decide.

272
00:23:09,194 --> 00:23:11,503
- I have new photos.
- No, these are good.

273
00:23:11,914 --> 00:23:14,826
- You hated me, didn't you?
- No. You were very good.

274
00:23:19,914 --> 00:23:21,347
She was good.

275
00:23:21,994 --> 00:23:24,713
She had the personality
of a zip code in Kansas.

276
00:23:25,114 --> 00:23:28,106
- She didn't have "it."
- What do you mean, "it"?

277
00:23:29,354 --> 00:23:31,026
"Lt" is a special quality.

278
00:23:31,354 --> 00:23:34,505
No matter what,
you cannot take your eyes off that person.

279
00:23:34,714 --> 00:23:38,184
Every word they say,
every gesture you're interested in.

280
00:23:38,754 --> 00:23:39,982
Do I have "it"?

281
00:23:41,354 --> 00:23:43,629
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. What?

282
00:23:45,794 --> 00:23:47,022
Do I have "it"?

283
00:23:49,434 --> 00:23:50,753
Yes, you do.

284
00:23:52,194 --> 00:23:53,707
I thought I did.

285
00:23:55,074 --> 00:23:56,666
Next. Who's next?

286
00:23:57,194 --> 00:23:59,025
Is this where I go to be a star?

287
00:23:59,114 --> 00:24:03,027
This is where you go to sacrifice,
learn your craft and work hard.

288
00:24:03,194 --> 00:24:06,311
Does that take more than a week?
I gave myself one week.

289
00:24:06,474 --> 00:24:11,264
- That's this office.
- We'll take a chance, see if you have "it."

290
00:24:11,594 --> 00:24:13,630
See if you have a special quality.

291
00:24:13,714 --> 00:24:16,353
See if you have the illusion
of the first time.

292
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:20,030
Where do I pay? It's $25, right?

293
00:24:20,354 --> 00:24:22,151
- A check?
- I have ID.

294
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:27,033
Maybe a less solid movie company
could take a check, but we only take cash.

295
00:24:28,794 --> 00:24:30,750
But I don't have any cash on me.

296
00:24:30,834 --> 00:24:34,429
I have cash, but just not on me,
and the banks aren't open.

297
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:36,186
There, there, there.

298
00:24:36,754 --> 00:24:39,632
There's the door.
We can't let you audition.

299
00:24:40,034 --> 00:24:42,753
- But I drove in from Ohio and...
- I'm sorry.

300
00:24:42,834 --> 00:24:44,426
- Well...
- I'm sorry.

301
00:24:44,754 --> 00:24:46,506
There you are. Goodbye.

302
00:24:47,394 --> 00:24:50,192
She looked pretty good, like she could act.

303
00:24:50,354 --> 00:24:53,585
Yeah, but if they don't pay to audition,
it could be dangerous.

304
00:24:53,674 --> 00:24:54,584
How?

305
00:24:54,674 --> 00:24:57,234
If she gets the part.
She might want to be paid.

306
00:24:57,314 --> 00:24:58,542
Maybe she had "it"!

307
00:24:58,634 --> 00:25:01,353
I didn't make the system.
The system is bigger...

308
00:25:04,434 --> 00:25:07,187
All right. If you want
the responsibility, fine.

309
00:25:14,714 --> 00:25:18,184
I talked it over with the man.
Says he'll take a check.

310
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:19,947
- He will?
- Yes.

311
00:25:21,434 --> 00:25:23,345
- He listens to you?
- Yeah.

312
00:25:28,074 --> 00:25:30,030
"I could never be with you, Todd.

313
00:25:30,114 --> 00:25:32,708
"I'm loyal to Keith. I'm loyal to him.

314
00:25:32,954 --> 00:25:35,832
"I could never, never kiss you."

315
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:25,551
Okay, that was very good.
Let's try it one more time.

316
00:26:25,674 --> 00:26:28,108
Slater, this time without the erection.

317
00:26:29,474 --> 00:26:31,908
Thank you, Mr. Bowfinger! Thank you!

318
00:26:37,434 --> 00:26:41,029
We gotta get a crew.
The best damn crew we can afford.

319
00:26:42,914 --> 00:26:44,552
<i>Ándale, muchachos!</i>

320
00:26:48,194 --> 00:26:49,786
In here. In here.

321
00:26:50,994 --> 00:26:52,746
Come on. In here.

322
00:26:54,074 --> 00:26:55,746
Welcome to America.

323
00:27:06,914 --> 00:27:09,667
I'm so happy to meet you.
This is gonna be great.

324
00:27:09,874 --> 00:27:12,468
I can tell you know what you're doing...

325
00:27:17,274 --> 00:27:19,834
Thanks for making the trip.
Glad to have you aboard.

326
00:27:19,914 --> 00:27:22,223
Guess what? We just closed Kit's deal.

327
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:25,593
Typical deal. Points. Name over the title.

328
00:27:25,754 --> 00:27:28,143
- We get only one take with Kit.
- One take?

329
00:27:28,234 --> 00:27:30,623
- He doesn't want to see the camera.
- How come?

330
00:27:30,714 --> 00:27:31,988
It's his way of working.

331
00:27:32,074 --> 00:27:36,033
He's so into his character, that if he sees
the camera, it breaks his concentration.

332
00:27:36,114 --> 00:27:39,789
- When do we start?
- We start tomorrow at 7:00 a.m.

333
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:50,108
What is it?

334
00:27:50,674 --> 00:27:52,630
I wish you could see what I see.

335
00:27:52,714 --> 00:27:54,466
What do you see, Boss?

336
00:27:55,714 --> 00:27:59,468
The most promising group of young
professionals I've ever worked with.

337
00:28:11,554 --> 00:28:14,022
- Hey, Cliff.
- 'Morning, Dave.

338
00:28:29,714 --> 00:28:30,908
- Good camera.
- Yeah.

339
00:28:30,994 --> 00:28:33,030
It goes back each night or it's a felony.

340
00:28:33,114 --> 00:28:35,867
- Years you'd get.
- You'd get. Daisy, come on.

341
00:28:36,034 --> 00:28:39,424
What if Daisy said, "It's a tough world"
instead of "rough world"?

342
00:28:39,514 --> 00:28:41,425
That's good. Got that briefcase?

343
00:28:41,514 --> 00:28:43,550
She'd bring his briefcase
if she was worried?

344
00:28:43,634 --> 00:28:46,307
The briefcase is a metaphor
for the relationship.

345
00:28:46,634 --> 00:28:50,422
Shouldn't I be in this scene?
I could be lurking behind a bush.

346
00:29:08,034 --> 00:29:10,423
Okay, this is it. Places, everyone.

347
00:29:11,634 --> 00:29:13,386
Roll! Speed! Marker!

348
00:29:15,594 --> 00:29:18,188
Remember, don't let him see the camera.

349
00:29:20,314 --> 00:29:21,508
Action.

350
00:29:26,634 --> 00:29:28,033
Come on, Daisy, go.

351
00:29:31,714 --> 00:29:32,988
Back to Daisy.

352
00:29:33,314 --> 00:29:35,544
Keith, you forgot your briefcase!

353
00:29:35,634 --> 00:29:38,353
Keith, you forgot... You're upset!

354
00:29:38,514 --> 00:29:42,348
One slip-up in your tough,
crime-filled world and you could die.

355
00:29:43,074 --> 00:29:44,792
Keith! Keith!

356
00:29:48,474 --> 00:29:51,307
- Your name Keith?
- No, I'm Jimmy.

357
00:29:51,634 --> 00:29:53,431
But thanks for asking.

358
00:29:57,594 --> 00:29:59,152
And, cut!

359
00:30:00,354 --> 00:30:02,151
We got our first shot.

360
00:30:07,594 --> 00:30:08,947
Here it comes.

361
00:30:12,354 --> 00:30:14,310
Come on. Work, baby, work.

362
00:30:25,154 --> 00:30:27,668
<i>Keith, you forgot your briefcase.</i>

363
00:30:27,834 --> 00:30:30,302
<i>You forgot... You're upset.</i>

364
00:30:30,394 --> 00:30:34,228
<i>One slip-up in your tough,</i>
<i>crime-filled world and you could die.</i>

365
00:30:34,754 --> 00:30:37,427
It worked. It looked like Daisy
came out of the house.

366
00:30:37,514 --> 00:30:39,152
This movie's gonna work!

367
00:30:47,514 --> 00:30:50,312
- Dave, did you wash my car?
- Workin' on it.

368
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:53,913
One scene down.

369
00:30:57,914 --> 00:31:00,303
- Yeah?
<i>- Bowfinger, here's what I got.</i>

370
00:31:00,394 --> 00:31:03,591
Kit and his agent will be
at the Rodeo Grille tomorrow at 12:45 p.m.

371
00:31:03,674 --> 00:31:05,027
Are we gonna be there?

372
00:31:05,114 --> 00:31:07,264
Better believe it. You're a genius.

373
00:31:24,554 --> 00:31:26,146
Can you see over there?

374
00:31:26,234 --> 00:31:28,668
- What do you see? Can you see Kit?
- Yeah.

375
00:31:29,594 --> 00:31:31,425
Am I trying for you or not trying?

376
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:33,789
You're trying,
but I want at least the same...

377
00:31:35,154 --> 00:31:38,191
I know I ain't gonna be treated like
Mighty Whitey in this town.

378
00:31:42,194 --> 00:31:45,504
I put in 25 years in the theater
before coming to Hollywood.

379
00:31:47,674 --> 00:31:48,993
We're almost ready.

380
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:52,589
I still don't see why I can't meet the man
I'm going to be working with.

381
00:31:52,674 --> 00:31:56,747
He wants to impress you with his acting,
and he needs his total concentration.

382
00:31:56,834 --> 00:31:58,392
- That's just young!
- I know.

383
00:31:58,474 --> 00:32:01,546
I wish once I could work with someone
who had honed their craft.

384
00:32:01,634 --> 00:32:05,183
- But right now we need that scene.
- You'll get your scene.

385
00:32:05,754 --> 00:32:08,348
He may not be a professional, but I am.

386
00:32:08,674 --> 00:32:09,823
Carol.

387
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:24,869
White boys get all the Oscars. It's a fact.

388
00:32:24,954 --> 00:32:27,263
- We know that, but...
- Did I get a nomination?

389
00:32:27,354 --> 00:32:30,585
No. 'Cause I ain't played none
of them slave roles.

390
00:32:30,674 --> 00:32:32,153
That's when you get nominated.

391
00:32:32,234 --> 00:32:34,464
Black dude plays a slave role,
gets nominated.

392
00:32:34,554 --> 00:32:36,943
White boy plays an idiot, gets the Oscar.

393
00:32:37,034 --> 00:32:40,265
Find me a script as a retarded slave,
then I get the Oscar.

394
00:32:41,314 --> 00:32:43,874
I'm gonna schmooze. I'll be right back.

395
00:32:44,234 --> 00:32:45,906
Go find that script.

396
00:32:46,634 --> 00:32:48,226
<i>Buck, the Wonder Slave.</i>

397
00:32:48,314 --> 00:32:49,633
Here we go.

398
00:32:56,674 --> 00:32:57,789
Sound.

399
00:33:01,714 --> 00:33:02,829
Lights!

400
00:33:19,634 --> 00:33:20,828
Roll it.

401
00:33:24,314 --> 00:33:27,704
When you left Phoenix, it wasn't
because you wanted to raise soybeans.

402
00:33:27,794 --> 00:33:29,830
You had to get away. Why?

403
00:33:30,034 --> 00:33:33,185
Was it because you wanted me
and it burned inside of you?

404
00:33:33,314 --> 00:33:35,350
- I beg your pardon?
- Come back to Phoenix.

405
00:33:35,434 --> 00:33:39,507
Stop this madness. Let me in on whatever
mission this is that you're doing.

406
00:33:39,594 --> 00:33:41,391
<i>- Do you know who I am?</i>
<i>- Of course.</i>

407
00:33:41,474 --> 00:33:44,671
<i>You're Keith Kincaid.</i>
<i>You've come down from Wyoming...</i>

408
00:33:44,834 --> 00:33:46,711
...with your damn UFOs.

409
00:33:46,834 --> 00:33:48,586
You bastard! Bastard!

410
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:54,028
- Because you prefer alien love!
- Alien love?

411
00:33:54,434 --> 00:33:57,710
- Why did you say "alien love"?
- I must get my umbrella.

412
00:33:57,874 --> 00:33:59,546
You triggered the voices.

413
00:34:02,474 --> 00:34:03,623
Freddy!

414
00:34:07,154 --> 00:34:09,384
Take me to Terry Stricter! Now!

415
00:34:13,674 --> 00:34:14,868
We got it.

416
00:34:14,954 --> 00:34:17,309
Strange people are coming
to me on the street...

417
00:34:17,394 --> 00:34:20,784
...and they're speaking in Jupiterian
or Venutian or something.

418
00:34:20,874 --> 00:34:23,911
Strangers come up to you,
and you don't understand them.

419
00:34:23,994 --> 00:34:26,064
- What is that?
- Maybe they're fans.

420
00:34:26,514 --> 00:34:28,744
- Crazy fans.
- They speak to me...

421
00:34:28,834 --> 00:34:32,065
...only they speak in a secret
white language that I can't decode.

422
00:34:32,154 --> 00:34:33,712
It's horrifying!

423
00:34:33,914 --> 00:34:38,226
What do these crazy people
who speak to you and make no sense say?

424
00:34:38,634 --> 00:34:41,785
They talk about things I never heard of,
about people I don't know.

425
00:34:41,874 --> 00:34:45,344
Somebody named Keith.
And aliens, sex and umbrellas.

426
00:34:47,234 --> 00:34:48,349
I see.

427
00:34:49,154 --> 00:34:50,223
Kit?

428
00:34:52,754 --> 00:34:55,029
Do you think you can keep it together?

429
00:34:56,314 --> 00:34:57,827
Yes, I can keep it together.

430
00:34:57,914 --> 00:35:01,543
I'm K-l-T, Kit. I'm keeping it together now.

431
00:35:01,714 --> 00:35:04,592
Keep it together. I'm keeping it together.

432
00:35:04,714 --> 00:35:08,548
- Don't I look together?
- Have you heard any more voices?

433
00:35:10,034 --> 00:35:11,023
No.

434
00:35:15,074 --> 00:35:18,669
Every now and then I hear a voice.
I haven't heard voices.

435
00:35:19,834 --> 00:35:21,870
What did this one voice say?

436
00:35:27,714 --> 00:35:30,023
"As I stand here before you today...

437
00:35:30,514 --> 00:35:32,982
"...the Laker Girls' cheerleading squad...

438
00:35:33,074 --> 00:35:35,508
"...needs to be taken down a peg or two."

439
00:35:41,554 --> 00:35:44,626
You know, last night was really special.

440
00:35:45,234 --> 00:35:48,192
It was. I've never done it
lying down before.

441
00:35:49,634 --> 00:35:51,625
- You know, next time...
- Yeah?

442
00:35:52,114 --> 00:35:55,663
Next time, I think I'd like to do it
with just two condoms.

443
00:35:55,994 --> 00:35:58,269
If I was in the movie more, yeah.

444
00:35:59,354 --> 00:36:03,825
If I was in the movie more,
we'd be equals, and I'd trust you more.

445
00:36:03,914 --> 00:36:06,587
- We have lots of scenes together.
- I love our scenes.

446
00:36:06,674 --> 00:36:10,508
Our scenes are the best,
but I should have more scenes with Kit.

447
00:36:10,594 --> 00:36:14,792
If I had more scenes with Kit,
then that would really pump up our scenes.

448
00:36:15,954 --> 00:36:19,993
Afrim would be in charge of that.
He's the screenwriter.

449
00:36:21,474 --> 00:36:24,193
- So the writer's in charge of that?
- Yeah.

450
00:36:31,794 --> 00:36:34,262
- Boss, I've got those pages.
- What pages?

451
00:36:34,354 --> 00:36:36,265
The new pages.

452
00:36:36,914 --> 00:36:39,223
I think if Daisy had more scenes with Kit...

453
00:36:39,314 --> 00:36:41,953
...it would pump up the scenes with Slater.

454
00:36:42,194 --> 00:36:45,903
So I wrote more scenes for Daisy and Kit,
some hot scenes...

455
00:36:46,234 --> 00:36:49,306
...where there's heat and chemistry.

456
00:36:49,474 --> 00:36:51,863
- I don't think we need...
- I think you will see...

457
00:36:51,954 --> 00:36:55,867
...these new hot scenes, the ones
in which Daisy exposes her breasts...

458
00:36:55,954 --> 00:36:58,024
...will increase sales in Thailand.

459
00:36:58,514 --> 00:36:59,788
Daisy agreed to this?

460
00:36:59,874 --> 00:37:02,308
That is the case,
although I haven't talked to her.

461
00:37:02,394 --> 00:37:03,827
- Baby.
- Hi.

462
00:37:07,314 --> 00:37:08,429
Hello.

463
00:37:09,314 --> 00:37:11,703
"A vixen in stretch pants.

464
00:37:12,154 --> 00:37:14,827
"What man wouldn't want a hot virgin?"

465
00:37:17,114 --> 00:37:18,069
You'll do this?

466
00:37:18,154 --> 00:37:21,146
If I have to. If it's for the movie,
and you really want me to.

467
00:37:21,234 --> 00:37:24,306
If it's artistic and says something
about reality...

468
00:37:24,394 --> 00:37:26,828
If it's in character and for the scene...

469
00:37:27,274 --> 00:37:28,627
Right, right.

470
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:32,911
Bowfinger International Pictures.
How may I direct your call? What?

471
00:37:32,994 --> 00:37:36,623
I tracked Kit to MindHead.
He could be coming down any time.

472
00:37:41,594 --> 00:37:43,107
All right, all right.

473
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:45,708
Kit feels he's ready to shoot
the parking lot scene.

474
00:37:45,794 --> 00:37:48,183
I just love the way this guy works.

475
00:39:36,634 --> 00:39:39,068
Keep it together. Keep it together.

476
00:39:40,754 --> 00:39:42,107
Keep it together.

477
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:02,593
And, cut!

478
00:40:03,594 --> 00:40:05,824
- Did you get that?
- Nice.

479
00:40:06,034 --> 00:40:08,628
- What'd you see?
- Fear. Mostly fear.

480
00:40:08,714 --> 00:40:11,433
- Some insane looks.
- You saw insane looks?

481
00:40:11,914 --> 00:40:14,269
Betsy, you were such a good girl.

482
00:40:16,074 --> 00:40:19,828
Let's get Carol out of her trailer,
shoot the other side of this masterpiece.

483
00:40:38,234 --> 00:40:40,065
- He's brilliant.
- He is.

484
00:40:41,274 --> 00:40:44,630
His fear is so real.
It's like it's actually happening.

485
00:40:57,074 --> 00:41:00,623
- We work really well together.
- That's what he was saying.

486
00:41:07,114 --> 00:41:08,911
<i>Bastard!</i>

487
00:41:10,754 --> 00:41:11,948
Darling.

488
00:41:15,634 --> 00:41:18,273
Darling, I respect Kit's way of working.

489
00:41:18,394 --> 00:41:20,783
The no rehearsal, no contact off screen.

490
00:41:20,874 --> 00:41:25,152
But it's so traditional to actually meet
the person you're working with.

491
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:28,949
No, you should not meet Kit because
we're not doing anything traditional here.

492
00:41:29,034 --> 00:41:32,743
We're working in a new style.
We're working in cinema nouveau.

493
00:41:34,394 --> 00:41:35,873
Cinema nouveau.

494
00:41:42,234 --> 00:41:44,748
It felt so good today to quit my job.

495
00:41:45,434 --> 00:41:47,902
I told them, "I'm a screenwriter now."

496
00:41:48,194 --> 00:41:50,754
They said,
"You have eight brothers and four sisters.

497
00:41:50,834 --> 00:41:54,509
"How will you earn your money?"
I said, "This is more important.

498
00:41:54,794 --> 00:41:59,390
"Bowfinger has given me a chance,
and I'm going to take it."

499
00:42:00,034 --> 00:42:02,264
You are a great writer. You really are.

500
00:42:02,354 --> 00:42:05,903
I love my new scenes. They're so great.
Are they going in?

501
00:42:06,034 --> 00:42:08,832
- That's up to Bowfinger.
- It is?

502
00:42:29,394 --> 00:42:31,749
That's sharp. Do the thing.

503
00:42:33,754 --> 00:42:36,143
I'm gonna look good in that. That's bad.

504
00:42:36,234 --> 00:42:38,429
Send it up to the house for me.

505
00:42:38,634 --> 00:42:42,183
The store would be happy to offer you
these clothes without charge...

506
00:42:42,274 --> 00:42:44,868
...if you'd come back Friday,
let us take a picture...

507
00:42:44,954 --> 00:42:47,912
...for <i>LA Style</i> of you wearing the clothes.

508
00:42:48,314 --> 00:42:51,624
I can do that. It'll cost you $1,000.
I'll be here Friday, 4:00.

509
00:42:51,714 --> 00:42:54,433
- I'm sure that could be arranged.
- Hundred-dollar bills.

510
00:42:54,514 --> 00:42:55,629
Right.

511
00:42:57,194 --> 00:42:59,754
I know I shouldn't do this,
I just want you to know...

512
00:42:59,834 --> 00:43:02,906
...that you were so real
in your response to the aliens.

513
00:43:02,994 --> 00:43:05,906
I wasn't even sure
I could be a pod person...

514
00:43:06,074 --> 00:43:09,862
...but now I'm enjoying it
because you made the aliens come alive.

515
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:12,229
It was like they were living inside of me.

516
00:43:12,314 --> 00:43:14,874
At first I was nervous
about us having sex...

517
00:43:14,994 --> 00:43:18,623
...but now I think it's fine as long
as we do it in a professional manner.

518
00:43:18,714 --> 00:43:20,670
There'll be a lot of people watching.

519
00:43:20,754 --> 00:43:22,790
I won't bother you anymore.

520
00:43:34,714 --> 00:43:36,352
He's in the grotto.

521
00:43:40,234 --> 00:43:42,543
What did this alien want from you?

522
00:43:43,194 --> 00:43:45,150
She wanted to inhale my gonads!

523
00:43:45,354 --> 00:43:47,822
- Say again?
- My gonads!

524
00:43:47,994 --> 00:43:51,350
They come down, pretend they're shaking
your hands, but they're not.

525
00:43:51,434 --> 00:43:54,312
They inhale your gonads
for special research.

526
00:43:54,794 --> 00:43:56,512
I got rid of the Sports Channel.

527
00:43:56,594 --> 00:43:59,586
No more gamma beams from Jupiter
messing with my mind.

528
00:44:00,234 --> 00:44:01,587
Keep it together.

529
00:44:01,794 --> 00:44:05,707
Kit, maybe you should stay
with us for a few days...

530
00:44:06,074 --> 00:44:09,828
...in our special celebrity relaxing quarters.

531
00:44:11,154 --> 00:44:13,588
- You think I need that?
- I do.

532
00:44:15,674 --> 00:44:17,187
Go get my checkbook.

533
00:44:19,154 --> 00:44:20,507
Keep it together.

534
00:44:24,274 --> 00:44:26,868
- Can't find Kit.
- What do you mean you can't find Kit?

535
00:44:26,954 --> 00:44:30,549
He's one of the most famous faces
in the world. You can find him.

536
00:44:30,674 --> 00:44:34,462
No. We staked out his house,
MindHead, everywhere.

537
00:44:34,634 --> 00:44:36,943
- He's vanished, gone.
- Where is the guy?

538
00:44:37,074 --> 00:44:40,953
We can't shoot movie without our star.
Actors have no work ethic these days.

539
00:44:41,034 --> 00:44:43,787
They keep his movements secret.
They control him.

540
00:44:43,874 --> 00:44:47,469
A lot of guys must look like Kit.
We'll get a look-alike for the long shots.

541
00:44:47,554 --> 00:44:49,943
We'll shoot him from behind
and not show his face.

542
00:44:50,034 --> 00:44:52,264
Kit showed his ass
in eight of his ten films...

543
00:44:52,354 --> 00:44:55,903
...eight of his ten films were hits,
so we need a guy with a fabulous ass...

544
00:44:55,994 --> 00:44:57,985
...and mine is the wrong color.

545
00:45:05,354 --> 00:45:08,232
Then I studied at the Moscow Arts Theater
for two years...

546
00:45:08,314 --> 00:45:10,589
...and did a year at the National in London.

547
00:45:10,674 --> 00:45:15,031
I'm currently doing a midnight production
of <i>Waiting for Godot</i> here in L.A.

548
00:45:15,474 --> 00:45:17,305
And are you in the union?

549
00:45:17,514 --> 00:45:18,788
Yes, I am.

550
00:45:22,634 --> 00:45:26,104
Currently, I'm packing fries
at the Burger King on Douglas.

551
00:45:26,234 --> 00:45:29,624
- Do you have experience in film?
- Quite a bit, actually.

552
00:45:29,794 --> 00:45:34,470
Quite a bit of experience.
I'm an active renter at Blockbuster...

553
00:45:34,834 --> 00:45:37,906
...and I attend the Film du Cinema...

554
00:45:38,034 --> 00:45:40,229
...as much as possible.

555
00:45:40,434 --> 00:45:44,586
Weekly, biweekly, inter-weekly,
intermediately.

556
00:45:45,314 --> 00:45:47,589
Would you be willing to cut your hair?

557
00:45:50,194 --> 00:45:53,470
Yes, but it's usually better
if someone else does it.

558
00:45:57,074 --> 00:45:58,985
I've had a few accidents.

559
00:46:02,394 --> 00:46:06,103
- Can you see without your glasses?
- Yeah. I can see.

560
00:46:07,954 --> 00:46:10,548
I don't really see well, but I can see.

561
00:46:11,514 --> 00:46:14,028
- Do you have contacts?
- I have contact lenses.

562
00:46:14,114 --> 00:46:16,753
I can wear contact lenses. That'd help.

563
00:46:17,434 --> 00:46:19,994
- Can I put my glasses back on?
- Sure, put them back on.

564
00:46:20,074 --> 00:46:21,951
I'm getting a little headache.

565
00:46:22,594 --> 00:46:25,904
Would you be willing to show
your naked rear end in a movie?

566
00:46:35,074 --> 00:46:36,666
Yeah, I guess so.

567
00:46:42,914 --> 00:46:46,793
- This is hard.
- Just one more question.

568
00:46:47,394 --> 00:46:51,831
In addition to being a star in this film,
would you also be willing to run errands?

569
00:46:53,274 --> 00:46:56,107
I'm really hoping
to get a career running errands.

570
00:46:56,194 --> 00:46:58,150
That'd be a major boost for me.

571
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:05,543
- What did you say your name was?
- Jiffrenson.

572
00:47:05,634 --> 00:47:08,512
- Jiffrenson?
- Jiff. My friends call me Jiff.

573
00:47:08,634 --> 00:47:10,784
Jiff, welcome aboard.

574
00:47:11,234 --> 00:47:12,952
Here's your wardrobe.

575
00:47:13,954 --> 00:47:16,468
All right! All right.

576
00:47:16,674 --> 00:47:19,188
Awesome. Awesome.

577
00:47:20,154 --> 00:47:21,428
All right.

578
00:47:29,194 --> 00:47:31,662
- How do you feel?
- I feel kind of strange.

579
00:47:31,874 --> 00:47:34,183
- You look good. You look tough.
- I do?

580
00:47:34,274 --> 00:47:36,390
Like an action star.

581
00:47:37,394 --> 00:47:40,113
Shoulders out. Take a good, deep breath.

582
00:47:40,674 --> 00:47:41,993
Suck it in.

583
00:47:43,634 --> 00:47:47,024
In this scene, you're hurting inside.
You're not sure who to trust.

584
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:49,947
You want to run into the arms
of your beloved.

585
00:47:51,314 --> 00:47:53,589
- Hi, I'm Daisy.
- Hi. How are you?

586
00:47:54,194 --> 00:47:57,869
When I yell "action," you are gonna run
from point "A" over there...

587
00:47:59,554 --> 00:48:01,351
...to point "B" over here.

588
00:48:02,634 --> 00:48:04,306
That seems kind of hard.

589
00:48:04,394 --> 00:48:06,783
Think of it as an errand.

590
00:48:07,154 --> 00:48:10,464
Your errand is to run across
the freeway until I yell, "Cut."

591
00:48:11,954 --> 00:48:15,264
I get it. But doesn't that seem
a little dangerous?

592
00:48:15,674 --> 00:48:18,313
No. We have professional stuntmen
doing the driving.

593
00:48:18,394 --> 00:48:20,112
You'll be completely safe.

594
00:48:20,354 --> 00:48:24,063
Professional stuntmen.
That's how they do it! I was wondering.

595
00:48:24,474 --> 00:48:27,227
- Stunt drivers.
- Okay, you ready to do one?

596
00:48:27,834 --> 00:48:30,064
Sure. They're going really fast!

597
00:48:41,554 --> 00:48:42,987
Action!

598
00:48:45,674 --> 00:48:47,107
Come on, Jiff!

599
00:48:48,074 --> 00:48:49,189
Action!

600
00:48:56,674 --> 00:48:59,711
Keith! I love you!

601
00:49:11,194 --> 00:49:12,343
Action!

602
00:49:40,914 --> 00:49:41,903
Cut!

603
00:49:45,754 --> 00:49:47,870
Heavenly Father! Heavenly Father!

604
00:49:47,954 --> 00:49:51,185
That was so great! You were fantastic!
Wasn't he great?

605
00:49:51,434 --> 00:49:53,664
Congratulations! That was so good!

606
00:49:53,754 --> 00:49:56,109
- I don't want to do this anymore.
- What?

607
00:49:56,194 --> 00:49:59,231
I just want to run errands. Heavenly God!

608
00:49:59,554 --> 00:50:03,547
Not many people can do what you just did.
The stunt drivers were really impressed.

609
00:50:03,634 --> 00:50:05,670
- Weren't they?
- Really?

610
00:50:05,754 --> 00:50:08,666
- We got an errand we want you to do.
- Really?

611
00:50:08,874 --> 00:50:12,913
We want you to go to Starbucks.
Get coffee for everybody.

612
00:50:12,994 --> 00:50:16,225
- I would love to go get coffee.
- You're the only one who can do it.

613
00:50:16,314 --> 00:50:18,270
I want to get the coffee now.

614
00:50:18,354 --> 00:50:20,663
But first, let's do this one more time.

615
00:50:21,034 --> 00:50:22,433
Heavenly God!

616
00:50:27,474 --> 00:50:28,748
Good work.

617
00:50:30,434 --> 00:50:33,232
Mr. Bowfinger, Bob,
can I talk to you about the new scenes?

618
00:50:33,314 --> 00:50:35,874
- I haven't decided yet.
- Can I talk to you about them?

619
00:50:35,954 --> 00:50:37,467
- Okay.
- I mean tonight?

620
00:50:41,754 --> 00:50:42,823
Okay.

621
00:51:27,194 --> 00:51:28,866
I'll be right there.

622
00:52:02,634 --> 00:52:05,432
Gets so tiring going out.
I thought we'd eat here.

623
00:52:05,554 --> 00:52:08,751
- I know the maitre d' at the lvy.
- That's so trendy.

624
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:12,622
- Do you like Vienna sausages?
- Yeah. Do you smell burning hair?

625
00:52:17,994 --> 00:52:21,623
This wine is so good. You can drink
all you want and not get drunk.

626
00:52:21,794 --> 00:52:22,988
Yeah.

627
00:52:24,114 --> 00:52:27,424
A big local hit in South Dakota.
What are your favorite TV shows?

628
00:52:27,514 --> 00:52:30,870
- I love <i>The Flintstones.</i>
- I love <i>The Flintstones</i> too! That's so good.

629
00:52:30,954 --> 00:52:33,832
- Do you like walks in the park?
- In the rain!

630
00:52:34,154 --> 00:52:36,668
I want you to see <i>The Music Man</i> because...

631
00:52:36,794 --> 00:52:39,262
- I love <i>The Music Man.</i>
- Isn't Robert Preston good?

632
00:52:39,354 --> 00:52:41,663
He's so good.
Do you love Smashing Pumpkins?

633
00:52:41,754 --> 00:52:45,110
I love to do that.
Have you ever had a shiatsu massage?

634
00:52:52,394 --> 00:52:54,703
- I love you so much!
- I love you!

635
00:52:54,914 --> 00:52:57,951
- I'm so alive!
- I've never been alive until now.

636
00:52:58,554 --> 00:52:59,782
Never till now.

637
00:53:02,834 --> 00:53:04,665
But I worry about our age difference.

638
00:53:04,754 --> 00:53:08,269
- What is age? It's a state of mind.
- That's the way I feel.

639
00:53:08,354 --> 00:53:10,743
Who cares if when I hit my sexual peak
you'll be 70?

640
00:53:10,834 --> 00:53:12,950
I know! It's Bogey and Bacall.

641
00:53:13,274 --> 00:53:14,309
Who?

642
00:53:15,954 --> 00:53:20,027
I promise to never play mind games
with your head.

643
00:53:20,114 --> 00:53:21,672
You are so today.

644
00:53:22,234 --> 00:53:24,384
- I want to make love to you!
- I do too!

645
00:53:24,474 --> 00:53:26,783
- I want you so much!
- I want you!

646
00:53:27,874 --> 00:53:30,752
- But I worry.
- Our love is bigger than worry.

647
00:53:31,034 --> 00:53:32,911
- I worry about the scenes.
- The scenes?

648
00:53:32,994 --> 00:53:34,985
If we're gonna shoot the new scenes.

649
00:53:35,074 --> 00:53:37,747
It's so hard to make love,
to give yourself to a man.

650
00:53:37,834 --> 00:53:40,428
It's the woman who's entered,
the woman who's violated.

651
00:53:40,514 --> 00:53:41,833
I so understand that.

652
00:53:41,914 --> 00:53:44,303
To know that the man inside you
is part of you...

653
00:53:44,394 --> 00:53:47,989
...and that he would not prevent
the added scenes of yours from being shot.

654
00:53:48,074 --> 00:53:49,712
- We're doing the scenes.
- We are?

655
00:53:49,794 --> 00:53:50,943
We're doing them 'cause...

656
00:53:51,034 --> 00:53:54,913
...you're brilliant. I want you in this movie,
and this movie is your movie.

657
00:53:54,994 --> 00:53:56,905
Let me just go get ready.

658
00:54:14,194 --> 00:54:15,866
I love you.

659
00:54:27,234 --> 00:54:28,872
I'll never use you.

660
00:54:29,634 --> 00:54:31,750
I will never abuse your trust.

661
00:54:36,954 --> 00:54:38,467
Thank you, Daisy.

662
00:54:38,554 --> 00:54:40,351
Not at all, not at all.

663
00:54:55,994 --> 00:54:57,871
Are we almost ready?

664
00:54:57,954 --> 00:54:59,785
Are you seeing the fireplace?

665
00:55:00,274 --> 00:55:02,424
We should light the fireplace.

666
00:55:02,794 --> 00:55:04,466
Is this a good mark?

667
00:55:08,234 --> 00:55:10,623
Daisy, my sweetness.

668
00:55:11,074 --> 00:55:12,587
Hi, how are you?

669
00:55:14,514 --> 00:55:16,186
- Hi.
- Are you okay?

670
00:55:16,354 --> 00:55:18,709
- Do you want to relax first or shoot?
- Shoot.

671
00:55:18,794 --> 00:55:21,627
You have such a good work ethic.
I so admire that.

672
00:55:21,954 --> 00:55:25,105
Here's your mark, it's a little small.
Will you be okay...

673
00:55:25,194 --> 00:55:26,183
All right, yeah.

674
00:55:26,274 --> 00:55:27,866
We have a very important scene.

675
00:55:27,954 --> 00:55:31,469
This is one of the hot scenes
that is about heat and...

676
00:55:34,714 --> 00:55:35,942
...chemistry.

677
00:55:36,434 --> 00:55:38,470
So it's the artistic portion of the film.

678
00:55:38,554 --> 00:55:42,593
Right, so give her a little room,
react normally, be sensitive above all...

679
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:45,945
...because in this scene
Daisy's gonna take off her blouse.

680
00:55:49,114 --> 00:55:50,672
All right. There's your mark.

681
00:55:50,754 --> 00:55:53,268
The scene is, you're not sure
if you still love Keith...

682
00:55:53,354 --> 00:55:56,187
...but you offer yourself to him
in order to save the planet.

683
00:55:56,274 --> 00:55:59,107
Right up here. We're starting here.

684
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:01,874
Pan up. And roll sound.

685
00:56:01,954 --> 00:56:04,548
- All right, let's go.
- Speed.

686
00:56:06,034 --> 00:56:08,423
- Mark.
- You're not sure if you love him...

687
00:56:08,514 --> 00:56:11,472
...but you want to save the planet,
and, action.

688
00:56:12,394 --> 00:56:15,067
Keith, I don't know what's right anymore.

689
00:56:15,314 --> 00:56:18,511
All I know is I have feelings
that make me need you.

690
00:56:18,834 --> 00:56:20,233
Need you now!

691
00:56:32,154 --> 00:56:33,348
Awesome!

692
00:56:36,794 --> 00:56:38,432
You're doing great!

693
00:56:40,994 --> 00:56:42,791
You're gonna be a star.

694
00:56:43,394 --> 00:56:44,713
And, cut.

695
00:56:53,874 --> 00:56:55,432
How's this, Boss?

696
00:57:10,834 --> 00:57:12,745
What's going on with him?

697
00:57:13,434 --> 00:57:16,665
The alien arrival scene is next
and Kit hasn't called in.

698
00:57:16,754 --> 00:57:18,745
Someone must know where he is.

699
00:57:19,074 --> 00:57:22,384
I know where Kit Ramsey's going
to be this afternoon.

700
00:57:25,114 --> 00:57:26,069
You do?

701
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:29,943
At 4:00 he's going to be
at Max's clothing store for a photo.

702
00:57:36,914 --> 00:57:40,065
Every day I get an offer on this thing.
It's the only one in L.A.

703
00:57:40,154 --> 00:57:42,873
- It's a beauty.
- Not a scratch. An award-winner.

704
00:57:42,954 --> 00:57:46,390
- Sold three cars to get this.
- You have a great eye for cars.

705
00:57:46,474 --> 00:57:49,944
My wife tried to take it in the divorce.
That would have really hurt.

706
00:57:50,034 --> 00:57:52,150
- Who got the kids?
- She did.

707
00:58:12,074 --> 00:58:13,712
Wait here a minute.

708
00:58:25,954 --> 00:58:28,309
- Manager in?
- No, he's home today.

709
00:58:28,794 --> 00:58:31,433
That's odd. We have a permit
to shoot here today.

710
00:58:31,514 --> 00:58:34,233
Weird. We'll just start loading
in the equipment.

711
00:58:34,314 --> 00:58:38,148
- You want me to call him?
- No, I'll call him from the cell phone.

712
00:58:44,874 --> 00:58:48,753
There's a guy in there who's vacuuming.
Tell him you're from the studio.

713
00:58:56,474 --> 00:58:58,988
- Who's in charge here?
- I am.

714
00:58:59,434 --> 00:59:02,346
- Do you have a permit to film here today?
- Yeah.

715
00:59:02,434 --> 00:59:03,947
May I see it, please?

716
00:59:05,314 --> 00:59:08,863
Can I talk to you for a second?
Did you ever think about acting?

717
00:59:31,594 --> 00:59:33,949
- This is it. Roll it.
- Mark!

718
00:59:39,914 --> 00:59:40,903
Action!

719
00:59:53,274 --> 00:59:55,993
That time away really helped calm my ass.

720
00:59:56,154 --> 00:59:58,429
Thought I was startin' to crack up.

721
00:59:58,514 --> 01:00:00,948
You ever think, there are no conspiracies?

722
01:00:01,034 --> 01:00:04,151
Maybe there's no aliens.
Everything's just as it seems.

723
01:00:04,314 --> 01:00:06,828
Being alone, by myself, in a chamber...

724
01:00:08,274 --> 01:00:09,832
<i>That was really helpful to me.</i>

725
01:00:09,914 --> 01:00:12,064
Freddy? Where the hell... Freddy?

726
01:00:13,474 --> 01:00:15,112
- Freddy!
- Hey, you!

727
01:00:16,034 --> 01:00:18,389
- Kincaid!
- Freddy!

728
01:00:20,034 --> 01:00:22,946
- You heard me, Kincaid!
- Freddy, don't play with me.

729
01:00:23,034 --> 01:00:24,626
Nice try, Kincaid.

730
01:00:25,154 --> 01:00:27,668
Don't act dumb. Where's the plutonium?

731
01:00:28,874 --> 01:00:32,913
That plutonium is mine. It's registered
to be used for religious purposes.

732
01:00:33,274 --> 01:00:35,071
You actually have some plutonium?

733
01:00:35,154 --> 01:00:36,473
He has plutonium?

734
01:00:36,554 --> 01:00:37,748
Don't play around.

735
01:00:37,834 --> 01:00:41,304
Freddy's about to have his guts replaced
with alien hardware.

736
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:44,910
- Aliens?
- They told me you were dead!

737
01:00:44,994 --> 01:00:46,871
And now you are dead!

738
01:00:52,034 --> 01:00:55,709
Keith, whenever you kill a pod person,
another one takes its place!

739
01:00:55,834 --> 01:00:58,985
- You won't take me in your spaceship!
- I love you!

740
01:00:59,154 --> 01:01:00,712
Keith! Keith!

741
01:01:03,194 --> 01:01:04,388
I love you!

742
01:01:04,594 --> 01:01:06,073
Stay with him!

743
01:01:10,474 --> 01:01:13,944
I came down because I wanted
to see them shoot you today.

744
01:01:14,154 --> 01:01:15,633
Shoot me today?

745
01:01:15,794 --> 01:01:17,750
My darling! Please, Keith!

746
01:01:18,154 --> 01:01:20,668
Let me love you! My darling baby!

747
01:01:20,834 --> 01:01:22,233
Come with me!

748
01:01:27,794 --> 01:01:29,307
He's coming! Stay with him.

749
01:01:36,394 --> 01:01:37,383
Keith!

750
01:01:38,394 --> 01:01:40,066
He's coming in here!

751
01:01:44,834 --> 01:01:45,823
Cut!

752
01:01:46,714 --> 01:01:50,343
Lyle, you might have won an Emmy,
but that doesn't mean anything here.

753
01:01:50,434 --> 01:01:53,346
I need to see the moment
where you realize he loves you.

754
01:01:53,434 --> 01:01:56,506
He's embroidering for you.
Doesn't that affect you in your heart?

755
01:01:56,594 --> 01:01:58,471
- Doesn't that make you...
- Kit Ramsey!

756
01:01:58,554 --> 01:02:00,465
Over here. I got the car running.

757
01:02:00,554 --> 01:02:02,624
- Freddy, show me your guts!
- What?

758
01:02:02,794 --> 01:02:05,149
Show me your guts right now!

759
01:02:06,394 --> 01:02:08,191
Pod people are all over the place!

760
01:02:08,274 --> 01:02:09,753
Pod people?

761
01:02:10,754 --> 01:02:12,984
Come on. We're gonna shoot scene 35!

762
01:02:14,354 --> 01:02:15,787
Keith!

763
01:02:16,874 --> 01:02:19,388
Who the hell is Keith? Open the door!

764
01:02:20,194 --> 01:02:21,309
Keith!

765
01:02:26,794 --> 01:02:28,147
Go, go, Freddy!

766
01:02:30,714 --> 01:02:31,703
Cut!

767
01:02:34,714 --> 01:02:36,113
I must say...

768
01:02:36,194 --> 01:02:39,903
...I am becoming more and more
impressed with Mr. Ramsey's acting style.

769
01:02:39,994 --> 01:02:41,473
I'm learning a lot from him.

770
01:02:41,554 --> 01:02:44,671
- I haven't done much of anything.
- What are you talking about?

771
01:02:44,754 --> 01:02:46,824
You look like Kit Ramsey. That's talent.

772
01:02:46,914 --> 01:02:49,030
Not everybody could look like Kit Ramsey.

773
01:02:49,114 --> 01:02:51,264
Robert DeNiro
could not look like Kit Ramsey.

774
01:02:51,354 --> 01:02:52,912
He annoys me anyway.

775
01:02:52,994 --> 01:02:55,428
If I go to the store to get some coffee...

776
01:02:55,514 --> 01:02:58,267
...I know that I'm the one
who'll get the coffee.

777
01:02:58,514 --> 01:03:00,505
I'm the one that got the coffee.

778
01:03:00,674 --> 01:03:03,507
I made sure the napkin was in the bag.

779
01:03:03,674 --> 01:03:06,632
I made sure there was cream,
there was sugar in the bag.

780
01:03:06,714 --> 01:03:09,228
I did it. Me! You know?

781
01:03:10,114 --> 01:03:13,550
It's weird for...
To get credit for lookin' like somebody.

782
01:03:14,194 --> 01:03:16,389
- What is that?
- That's a gift!

783
01:03:17,074 --> 01:03:20,544
I don't know how much of a gift it is.
I am his brother.

784
01:03:23,514 --> 01:03:25,982
That's what's so great
about working with you guys.

785
01:03:26,074 --> 01:03:29,464
Whenever someone finds out
I'm related to Kit Ramsey...

786
01:03:29,554 --> 01:03:32,830
...they want me to introduce them to him,
and I can understand that.

787
01:03:32,914 --> 01:03:36,953
But it feels good to have somebody
like you for you.

788
01:03:37,034 --> 01:03:38,945
It's great. I feel great.

789
01:03:42,954 --> 01:03:45,104
- You get along with your brother?
- Yeah.

790
01:03:45,194 --> 01:03:47,833
We haven't seen him in a while.
He's been so busy.

791
01:03:47,914 --> 01:03:49,870
He's crankin' them out, back-to-back.

792
01:03:49,954 --> 01:03:52,787
He didn't even come home
for last Christmas.

793
01:03:53,434 --> 01:03:56,187
- I'm sorry, darling.
- That's okay.

794
01:03:56,834 --> 01:04:00,952
I'm here with this fantastic group of people
who accept me for who I am.

795
01:04:01,034 --> 01:04:04,663
Just the poor, stupid brother of someone
who everybody loves.

796
01:04:11,754 --> 01:04:13,870
So, are you from a show-business family?

797
01:04:13,954 --> 01:04:15,023
We're screwed.

798
01:04:15,114 --> 01:04:18,709
We luck into the brother
of the world's hottest movie star...

799
01:04:18,994 --> 01:04:21,792
...but I have a conscience.
- Don't be so hard on yourself.

800
01:04:21,874 --> 01:04:23,546
You hear him? He's an innocent.

801
01:04:23,634 --> 01:04:25,864
He told us how much he loved us.

802
01:04:26,114 --> 01:04:27,752
I just can't do it.

803
01:04:28,674 --> 01:04:31,746
I gotta take the camera back.
You'll work it out.

804
01:04:32,674 --> 01:04:34,153
I can't do it.

805
01:04:35,034 --> 01:04:37,912
What I like is <i>Citizen Kane.</i>
Very good movie.

806
01:04:39,074 --> 01:04:41,144
What's good is <i>Apocalypse Now.</i>

807
01:04:41,234 --> 01:04:44,032
<i>Godfather. Dr. Strangelove.</i>

808
01:04:44,754 --> 01:04:47,314
- Stanley Kubrick.
<i>- A Clockwork Orange.</i>

809
01:04:47,394 --> 01:04:48,827
Mr. Bowfinger.

810
01:04:49,354 --> 01:04:52,152
Mr. Bowfinger, I got something to tell you.

811
01:04:52,274 --> 01:04:54,504
I have something to tell you.
Come over here.

812
01:04:54,594 --> 01:04:56,983
- Can I talk first?
- All right, all right.

813
01:04:57,634 --> 01:05:00,194
Being Kit Ramsey's brother...

814
01:05:00,274 --> 01:05:03,072
...sometimes it has its fringe benefits.

815
01:05:03,554 --> 01:05:05,112
How do you mean?

816
01:05:06,714 --> 01:05:10,184
You'll never guess
who I had intercourse with in the van.

817
01:05:18,354 --> 01:05:20,151
Isn't that cool?

818
01:05:22,154 --> 01:05:25,590
She gave me the works.
She is the most inventive girl.

819
01:05:25,714 --> 01:05:29,150
- Can I see you in my office?
- Yeah, sure. She's so strong.

820
01:05:29,314 --> 01:05:32,147
She's pure power and speed. Real hot.

821
01:05:34,114 --> 01:05:35,991
I got an errand for you.

822
01:05:36,714 --> 01:05:40,343
Go to Starbucks,
and I want you to get some coffee.

823
01:05:40,434 --> 01:05:42,470
Go to Starbucks and get some coffee.

824
01:05:42,554 --> 01:05:45,273
- You're gonna need napkins for everybody.
- I got that.

825
01:05:45,354 --> 01:05:48,551
Call your brother,
find out where he's going today.

826
01:05:48,634 --> 01:05:50,670
Find out where Kit's going.

827
01:05:50,754 --> 01:05:54,349
- Then pick up pencils from store...
- Pencils from the store.

828
01:05:54,434 --> 01:05:55,992
Then sharpen the pencils.

829
01:05:56,074 --> 01:05:57,871
- You got it?
- Yeah, I got it.

830
01:05:57,994 --> 01:06:01,828
Coffee, napkins, stationery,
find out where my brother's going.

831
01:06:02,434 --> 01:06:05,153
- Ride like the wind.
- I'm gone, man! Gone!

832
01:06:06,394 --> 01:06:07,907
I want to see you.

833
01:06:13,874 --> 01:06:16,024
- We are finished. We are over.
- How come?

834
01:06:16,114 --> 01:06:17,866
- You had sex with Jiff.
- So?

835
01:06:18,674 --> 01:06:21,507
- Never thought of it that way.
- I'll see you tonight at 8:00?

836
01:06:21,594 --> 01:06:22,424
Okay.

837
01:07:04,274 --> 01:07:06,742
There's someone who thinks
he should talk to you.

838
01:07:06,834 --> 01:07:09,029
He says it concerns Kit Ramsey.

839
01:07:16,914 --> 01:07:20,509
This is Bob, a Level Six.
He's been with us for four years.

840
01:07:20,834 --> 01:07:23,394
There's something he wants to tell you.

841
01:07:27,434 --> 01:07:30,551
- Jack, just taking her out for a wash.
- Okay.

842
01:07:45,794 --> 01:07:49,309
We still have this one last scene,
the big ending or we don't have a movie.

843
01:07:49,394 --> 01:07:52,306
- I know what else we don't have.
- What?

844
01:07:53,594 --> 01:07:54,868
Permission.

845
01:07:56,914 --> 01:07:58,870
Did you know Tom Cruise had no idea...

846
01:07:58,954 --> 01:08:01,912
...he was in that vampire movie
till two years later?

847
01:08:02,714 --> 01:08:03,749
Hello?

848
01:08:04,674 --> 01:08:05,868
Hi, Jiff.

849
01:08:08,794 --> 01:08:12,264
He's leaving his house at 4:45
to go to MindHead. Great work.

850
01:08:12,394 --> 01:08:15,386
Now, we really need those pencils, buddy.

851
01:08:16,514 --> 01:08:18,550
I will see you at the location.

852
01:08:18,874 --> 01:08:21,388
We are about to shoot
the final scene in this movie.

853
01:08:21,474 --> 01:08:23,544
I just talked with Kit. He is very excited.

854
01:08:23,634 --> 01:08:25,989
So know your jobs. Don't screw up.
Let's go.

855
01:08:26,074 --> 01:08:28,065
We have one hour to get there.

856
01:08:28,314 --> 01:08:31,704
Make sure Slater has finished painting
that car! Let's go!

857
01:08:32,074 --> 01:08:34,508
- Can I talk to you about the scene?
- Sure.

858
01:08:35,514 --> 01:08:37,027
This is a hard scene for Kit.

859
01:08:37,114 --> 01:08:39,628
He probably won't want
to get in that car with you.

860
01:08:39,714 --> 01:08:42,274
He'll probably really resist
because of his character.

861
01:08:42,354 --> 01:08:44,231
So you have to be very persuasive...

862
01:08:44,314 --> 01:08:47,033
Because he doesn't know
he's in the movie.

863
01:08:48,474 --> 01:08:52,308
I know what's going on.
I may be from Ohio, but I'm not from Ohio.

864
01:08:54,714 --> 01:08:55,908
I'm not mad.

865
01:08:55,994 --> 01:08:58,269
- I'm working, aren't I?
- But...

866
01:09:00,234 --> 01:09:01,633
Who told you?

867
01:09:01,954 --> 01:09:03,592
We're packed and loaded.

868
01:09:03,714 --> 01:09:04,783
Hi, honey.

869
01:09:04,994 --> 01:09:08,703
Hi, sweetie. Will you make sure
my makeup case is in the van?

870
01:09:13,554 --> 01:09:14,987
Let's hit it!

871
01:10:12,874 --> 01:10:14,910
Anybody want a Frostee Freeze?

872
01:10:15,034 --> 01:10:17,548
I look like I want
some damn Frostee Freeze?

873
01:10:26,474 --> 01:10:28,066
Holy shit!

874
01:10:30,114 --> 01:10:31,945
- Reverse it!
- I got it.

875
01:10:33,874 --> 01:10:35,023
Hold on!

876
01:10:36,834 --> 01:10:38,028
What the hell?

877
01:10:44,154 --> 01:10:45,746
It's the dead guy!

878
01:10:59,114 --> 01:11:01,150
Please don't let me die!

879
01:11:09,874 --> 01:11:11,387
This is awesome!

880
01:11:34,394 --> 01:11:35,952
It's going down!

881
01:11:36,514 --> 01:11:39,267
Right now, it's going down.
I'm so glad you're here.

882
01:11:39,354 --> 01:11:42,027
- I'm Kit Ramsey!
- That's Kit Ramsey.

883
01:11:42,114 --> 01:11:44,025
You know who I am, right?

884
01:11:44,514 --> 01:11:46,744
Please, one at a time. I can't hear you.

885
01:11:46,834 --> 01:11:50,065
I'm Number 13 on <i>Premiere's</i> power list.
What are you doin'?

886
01:11:50,354 --> 01:11:53,983
Tough guys like you
don't get far in this world.

887
01:11:54,114 --> 01:11:56,628
We've been getting pursued
by alien forces!

888
01:11:56,914 --> 01:11:58,063
Aliens!

889
01:12:18,194 --> 01:12:23,143
I should never have slept with the alien
life form from the star system Neon!

890
01:12:32,274 --> 01:12:33,502
Shit!

891
01:12:37,474 --> 01:12:39,271
My gonads! My gonads!

892
01:12:40,714 --> 01:12:43,945
Keith, there's only one way out of this.
Follow me!

893
01:12:46,514 --> 01:12:47,993
Kiss you? Now?

894
01:12:49,194 --> 01:12:51,230
Danger really turns you on!

895
01:12:53,394 --> 01:12:54,873
Get in the car.

896
01:12:55,154 --> 01:12:58,066
We must get to the alien antenna
before the summer solstice!

897
01:12:58,154 --> 01:13:00,748
You best hurry! I'm Keith.

898
01:13:34,074 --> 01:13:35,985
That way, Carol. This way.

899
01:13:41,714 --> 01:13:44,911
Bill, we're here! Put the tripod there.
All right, ready?

900
01:13:45,394 --> 01:13:47,862
We gotta eat.
How we could know if we're starving?

901
01:13:47,954 --> 01:13:51,424
I needed love, love so strong,
but the alien embryos had already...

902
01:13:51,514 --> 01:13:52,993
Hit the lights!

903
01:13:55,914 --> 01:13:56,949
Action.

904
01:13:58,714 --> 01:13:59,908
Get out!

905
01:14:01,994 --> 01:14:03,712
There's the alien antenna.

906
01:14:03,794 --> 01:14:06,308
That's where you must go to say,
"Gotcha, suckers!"

907
01:14:06,394 --> 01:14:08,954
If you don't, we will all become pod people.

908
01:14:09,594 --> 01:14:11,550
Cut! Let's move the camera.

909
01:14:11,634 --> 01:14:15,309
They will impregnate everyone,
including the CIA and the FBI!

910
01:14:16,314 --> 01:14:19,192
Soon as you're set,
start rolling on the stairwell.

911
01:14:20,034 --> 01:14:21,228
In here!

912
01:14:26,474 --> 01:14:29,511
They're all aliens worshipping
their false gods.

913
01:14:33,754 --> 01:14:35,790
- Come on! Come on!
- No! No!

914
01:14:36,674 --> 01:14:38,949
<i>Keep running since you're</i>
<i>with the one person...</i>

915
01:14:39,034 --> 01:14:40,308
I got them.

916
01:14:42,874 --> 01:14:43,545
Shit!

917
01:14:43,634 --> 01:14:45,306
Cut to the stairwell.

918
01:14:45,394 --> 01:14:48,704
<i>Then I realized it was you</i>
<i>that I loved and...</i>

919
01:14:49,834 --> 01:14:51,711
The roof is your next shot.

920
01:14:53,274 --> 01:14:54,866
Bastard! Bastard!

921
01:14:55,474 --> 01:14:57,783
- No, no, I'm Keith!
- Bastard!

922
01:15:03,274 --> 01:15:04,343
<i>Stop it!</i>

923
01:15:05,554 --> 01:15:06,623
Stop it!

924
01:15:16,474 --> 01:15:17,668
Shit!

925
01:15:19,234 --> 01:15:21,304
She was from the planet Neon!

926
01:15:21,794 --> 01:15:23,830
Don't bring that shit over here!

927
01:15:24,034 --> 01:15:24,989
<i>Put that down!</i>

928
01:15:25,074 --> 01:15:26,871
Cut! Okay, outside.

929
01:15:27,874 --> 01:15:29,353
Drop that shit!

930
01:15:32,474 --> 01:15:36,433
We must run. We have only 40 seconds!

931
01:15:43,154 --> 01:15:45,509
This is it. We only need one shot.

932
01:15:54,154 --> 01:15:56,463
Only one thing can stop them now.

933
01:15:56,714 --> 01:15:59,182
- Lf you say, "Gotcha, suckers!"
- What?

934
01:15:59,994 --> 01:16:02,110
- Put your hands right here.
- What?

935
01:16:02,194 --> 01:16:04,105
Go! Cue the pyrotechnics.

936
01:16:06,874 --> 01:16:07,863
Shit!

937
01:16:07,954 --> 01:16:09,706
My God! It's time!

938
01:16:11,034 --> 01:16:13,502
Look into the sky and say,
"Gotcha, suckers!"

939
01:16:13,594 --> 01:16:14,788
Kincaid!

940
01:16:21,514 --> 01:16:22,993
Gotcha, suckers!

941
01:16:24,074 --> 01:16:25,587
Come on, say it.

942
01:16:28,634 --> 01:16:30,147
Come on, say it!

943
01:17:13,114 --> 01:17:17,983
It seems the paranoid
are sometimes actually being followed.

944
01:17:18,554 --> 01:17:20,749
This film is only for Madagascar and Iran...

945
01:17:20,834 --> 01:17:23,667
...neither of which
accept American copyright law.

946
01:17:23,834 --> 01:17:26,826
Terry! I'm Keith Kincaid.

947
01:17:27,514 --> 01:17:29,505
I saved the world.

948
01:17:30,874 --> 01:17:32,193
I saved it.

949
01:17:46,914 --> 01:17:51,430
I have eight brothers, four sisters,
and no job! I'm screwed!

950
01:17:51,514 --> 01:17:54,267
There's no movie!
I can't believe there's no movie!

951
01:17:54,354 --> 01:17:56,504
I didn't look for work,
I thought I was working.

952
01:17:56,594 --> 01:18:00,030
- I showed my breasts on film. For what?
- I'm a felon.

953
01:18:00,354 --> 01:18:02,993
My friends, I have a cousin who's a lawyer.

954
01:18:03,274 --> 01:18:06,630
I say we take action. We sue. Sue! Sue!

955
01:18:07,154 --> 01:18:09,065
Carol, what do you think?

956
01:18:12,194 --> 01:18:13,388
I think...

957
01:18:15,634 --> 01:18:17,829
I think it was a beautiful lie.

958
01:18:40,714 --> 01:18:42,386
It could've worked.

959
01:18:48,714 --> 01:18:51,023
Boss, what you want me to do
with this stuff?

960
01:18:51,114 --> 01:18:52,706
- What is it?
- It's the film.

961
01:18:52,794 --> 01:18:55,547
I told him to follow Kit around
and get some random shots.

962
01:18:55,634 --> 01:18:57,829
You never know. We could've used it.

963
01:18:57,994 --> 01:18:59,222
The trash is outside.

964
01:18:59,314 --> 01:19:01,987
- I wanna take a look at it.
- Why hurt ourselves?

965
01:19:02,074 --> 01:19:04,065
We need Kit Ramsey's permission.

966
01:19:04,154 --> 01:19:07,112
Why didn't someone bring that up
to me at some point?

967
01:19:08,234 --> 01:19:10,145
<i>Hold up, hold up.</i>

968
01:19:15,434 --> 01:19:18,312
Useless. A tennis-playing alien fighter.

969
01:19:24,554 --> 01:19:25,907
Nice work, guys.

970
01:19:26,034 --> 01:19:28,912
Thank you, Mr. Bowfinger.
We used a Pro-Mist...

971
01:19:28,994 --> 01:19:32,873
...and tried to open up the aperture
to give him a rim light.

972
01:19:39,474 --> 01:19:41,032
What's he doing?

973
01:19:53,114 --> 01:19:55,582
I think we just got our permission.

974
01:20:12,794 --> 01:20:14,386
<i>Hey, Laker Girls.</i>

975
01:20:20,874 --> 01:20:22,353
<i>It's not funny!</i>

976
01:20:34,954 --> 01:20:39,470
You realize all courts in the country
would consider this blackmail!

977
01:20:42,594 --> 01:20:46,587
I don't know anything about blackmail.
I'm just a guy with a great film.

978
01:20:46,674 --> 01:20:49,029
I need a shot of Kit saying,
"Gotcha, suckers"...

979
01:20:49,114 --> 01:20:50,672
...and a couple of close-ups.

980
01:20:50,754 --> 01:20:54,793
Or we'll use a shot of Kit wagging his thing
at the Laker Girls.

981
01:20:54,994 --> 01:20:57,269
Which is a great ending.

982
01:20:57,354 --> 01:20:59,629
Though not such a good ending for Kit.

983
01:20:59,714 --> 01:21:02,148
It could sort of stop his money flow...

984
01:21:02,234 --> 01:21:06,671
...and possibly make that family film
he's about to do, just...

985
01:21:11,714 --> 01:21:13,830
We'll have to think about it.

986
01:21:15,714 --> 01:21:19,502
We'll have to think about it, for Kit.

987
01:21:24,114 --> 01:21:26,582
Now that you've had time
to think about it...

988
01:21:26,674 --> 01:21:30,383
...what do you and the other fellows
here at MindFu... Head think?

989
01:22:06,314 --> 01:22:07,872
Good to see you.

990
01:22:10,874 --> 01:22:12,353
This way.

991
01:22:31,314 --> 01:22:33,350
Not bad seats at all!

992
01:22:52,634 --> 01:22:55,387
<i>CIA operative, Todd Delmonico...</i>

993
01:22:55,514 --> 01:22:58,984
<i>... drove his '53 Buick to meet Keith Kincaid.</i>

994
01:23:00,394 --> 01:23:01,827
<i>Kincaid!</i>

995
01:23:02,154 --> 01:23:04,190
<i>It had rained that day.</i>

996
01:23:04,394 --> 01:23:07,750
<i>But was it normal rain?</i>
<i>Or was it Chubby Rain?</i>

997
01:23:08,034 --> 01:23:10,548
<i>- Freddy?</i>
<i>- You heard me there, Kincaid.</i>

998
01:23:11,274 --> 01:23:12,423
<i>Freddy?</i>

999
01:23:15,954 --> 01:23:19,663
<i>Freddy's about to have his guts replaced</i>
<i>with alien hardware!</i>

1000
01:23:41,434 --> 01:23:42,867
<i>Gotcha, suckers!</i>

1001
01:24:00,154 --> 01:24:02,509
A hit. A hit.

1002
01:24:24,874 --> 01:24:26,307
Hey, you guys!

1003
01:24:27,274 --> 01:24:29,310
I want you to meet somebody.

1004
01:24:29,834 --> 01:24:32,302
This is Farrah.
Farrah and I met at the premiere.

1005
01:24:32,394 --> 01:24:35,466
Farrah's one of the most powerful lesbians
in Hollywood.

1006
01:24:35,954 --> 01:24:37,069
Bravo!

1007
01:24:46,474 --> 01:24:48,624
I can't talk to you right now.

1008
01:25:58,514 --> 01:26:01,904
It's an offer to direct a movie in Taiwan
starring Kit Ramsey's brother.

1009
01:26:01,994 --> 01:26:03,985
Oh, my God! Are you serious?

1010
01:26:06,034 --> 01:26:07,831
We're goin' to Taiwan!

1011
01:27:10,714 --> 01:27:12,033
Jiff! Jiff!

1012
01:27:28,154 --> 01:27:30,349
Good to see you again, brother.

1013
