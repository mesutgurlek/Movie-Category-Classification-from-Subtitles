1
00:00:55,315 --> 00:00:58,644
All right Jim your
quarterlies look very good.

2
00:00:58,784 --> 00:01:00,925
How the thing is
going at the library ?

3
00:01:00,975 --> 00:01:03,108
Oh I told you
couldn't closet so

4
00:01:03,215 --> 00:01:06,553
So you've come to the
master for guidance ?

5
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,871
Is this what you're
saying grasshopper?

6
00:01:08,954 --> 00:01:11,590
Actually you called
me in here, but yeah.

7
00:01:12,235 --> 00:01:14,521
All right, well let me
show you how it's done.

8
00:01:14,635 --> 00:01:17,342
Yes, I'd like to speak to
your office manager please

9
00:01:17,385 --> 00:01:20,938
yes hello this is Michael
Scott, I am the regional manager

10
00:01:20,953 --> 00:01:22,843
of Dundler Mifflin
paper products.

11
00:01:23,266 --> 00:01:26,025
Just wanted to talk to
you manager on manager.

12
00:01:28,972 --> 00:01:31,855
All right done deal,
thank you very much sir,

13
00:01:32,045 --> 00:01:33,639
you're a gentleman
and the scholar.

14
00:01:35,835 --> 00:01:39,558
Oh I'm sorry, ok,
I'm sorry, my mistake.

15
00:01:41,699 --> 00:01:46,760
That was a woman I was talking
to... she had a very low voice.

16
00:01:47,295 --> 00:01:48,854
Probably a smoker.

17
00:01:52,824 --> 00:01:54,169
Soso that's the
way it's done.

18
00:01:54,575 --> 00:01:57,585
I've been in Dundler
Mifflin for twelve years,

19
00:01:57,588 --> 00:02:00,013
the last four as
regional manager

20
00:02:00,355 --> 00:02:02,555
If you want to
come through here,

21
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,622
so we have the
entire floor,

22
00:02:05,723 --> 00:02:07,913
so this is my kingdom,
as far as the eye can see,

23
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:10,887
ah this is our
receptionist Pam.

24
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,828
Pam, Pam Pam! Pam Beesly.

25
00:02:14,241 --> 00:02:16,222
Pam has been with us for

26
00:02:16,355 --> 00:02:18,363
for ever, right Pam?

27
00:02:18,724 --> 00:02:19,667
Well, I don't know!

28
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,962
If you think
she's cute now

29
00:02:21,013 --> 00:02:23,568
you should have seen her
a couple of years ago!

30
00:02:23,713 --> 00:02:24,170
What?

31
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,457
Any messages?

32
00:02:27,837 --> 00:02:29,173
Yeah, just a fax

33
00:02:31,212 --> 00:02:32,538
Pam this is
from corporate.

34
00:02:32,553 --> 00:02:34,194
How many times have I
told you that there's

35
00:02:34,214 --> 00:02:36,401
a special filing cabinet
for things from corporate.

36
00:02:36,455 --> 00:02:37,039
You haven't told me!

37
00:02:37,066 --> 00:02:38,942
It's called the
wastepaper basket.

38
00:02:41,776 --> 00:02:42,485
Look at that !

39
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:45,381
Look at that face!

40
00:02:45,515 --> 00:02:47,188
People say I'm
the best boss.

41
00:02:48,135 --> 00:02:50,561
They go, "God we've never worked
in a place like this before,

44
00:03:01,573 --> 00:03:02,831
I found it at
Spencer Gifts.

45
00:03:22,867 --> 00:03:25,629
My job is to
speak to clients

46
00:03:25,727 --> 00:03:30,149
on the phone
about quantities

47
00:03:30,224 --> 00:03:34,910
and type of copier paper.

48
00:03:35,484 --> 00:03:38,402
You know, whether
we can supply to them

49
00:03:38,411 --> 00:03:44,040
whether they can
pay for it and...

50
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:50,546
I'm boring myself just
talking about this.

51
00:03:58,785 --> 00:04:00,491
He still loves that
after seven years!

52
00:04:22,285 --> 00:04:22,605
What?

53
00:04:23,813 --> 00:04:24,309
Nothing

54
00:04:25,404 --> 00:04:27,713
Ok, all right.
See you later

55
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:30,863
All right, take care.

56
00:04:31,621 --> 00:04:32,845
Back to work.

57
00:04:42,707 --> 00:04:45,964
Corporate really doesn't interfere
with me at all, Jan Levinson-Gould

58
00:04:45,965 --> 00:04:47,314
Jan, hello!

59
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:50,931
I call her Hillary
Rodham Clinton, right?

60
00:04:50,993 --> 00:04:52,676
Not to her face because,

61
00:04:52,745 --> 00:04:56,936
not because I'm scared
of her, because I'm not

62
00:04:57,084 --> 00:04:58,197
but...

63
00:04:58,554 --> 00:04:59,287
yeah.

64
00:04:59,815 --> 00:05:02,124
All right, was it anything you
wanted to add to the agenda?

65
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:06,041
Me no get an agenda.

66
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,099
I'm sorry, what?

67
00:05:08,115 --> 00:05:09,279
I didn't get any agenda.

68
00:05:09,585 --> 00:05:11,464
Oh I faxed one
overdue this morning.

69
00:05:11,505 --> 00:05:15,521
Really? Cause I didn'tdid
we get a fax this morning?

70
00:05:15,685 --> 00:05:17,524
Yeah, the one

71
00:05:18,243 --> 00:05:21,389
Why isn't it in my hand?

72
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:24,178
Because a company runs on
efficiency of communication, right?

73
00:05:25,545 --> 00:05:28,730
So what's the problem
Pam, why I didn't get it?

74
00:05:29,894 --> 00:05:33,509
You put it in the garbage can
that was a special filing cabinet.

75
00:05:37,563 --> 00:05:42,386
Yeah, that was a joke, that
was actually my brother's,

76
00:05:42,445 --> 00:05:46,501
it was supposed to be with bills
and doesn't work great with faxes.

77
00:05:46,502 --> 00:05:47,165
Do you want to
look at mine?

78
00:05:47,216 --> 00:05:49,398
Yeah. Thank you.

79
00:05:49,571 --> 00:05:53,119
Ok since the last meeting,
Alan and the board have decided

80
00:05:53,124 --> 00:05:55,830
that we can't justify Scranton
branch and the Stafford branch

81
00:05:55,835 --> 00:05:57,185
Oh ok

82
00:05:57,209 --> 00:05:58,393
No, Michael don't panic

83
00:05:58,394 --> 00:06:00,728
No no no no this is
good, this is fine

84
00:06:00,731 --> 00:06:02,276
Michael listen,
don't panic

85
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:05,279
We haven't made
any decisions yet,

86
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,056
I've spoken to Joshua in Stanford
I've told him the same as you

87
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:11,352
and it's up to either you or him to convince
me that your branch can incorporate the other

88
00:06:11,364 --> 00:06:12,113
Ok no problem

89
00:06:12,124 --> 00:06:14,183
This does however mean that
there is going to be downsizing

90
00:06:14,185 --> 00:06:16,217
Me no wanna
hear that Jan,

91
00:06:16,745 --> 00:06:19,054
because downsizing
is a bitch,

92
00:06:19,085 --> 00:06:21,020
it is a real bitch,

93
00:06:21,523 --> 00:06:24,215
and I wouldn't wish
that on Joshua's men,

94
00:06:24,464 --> 00:06:26,551
I certainly wouldn't
wish it on my men,

95
00:06:26,613 --> 00:06:29,238
or women present
company excluded...sorry.

96
00:06:30,165 --> 00:06:32,656
is Josh concerned about
downsizing himself?

97
00:06:33,842 --> 00:06:36,452
Not downsizing himself but is
he concerned about downsizing?

98
00:06:41,823 --> 00:06:43,555
Question: how long
do we have to 

99
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:48,783
Oh, Todd Paker, terrific
rept, do you mind if I take it?

100
00:06:48,785 --> 00:06:50,473
No, go ahead

101
00:06:50,626 --> 00:06:51,338
Pac man!

102
00:06:51,349 --> 00:06:52,905
Hey, big queen

103
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,804
Oh, that's
not appropriate

104
00:06:54,832 --> 00:06:57,252
Hey, <?is old gut
zumee ?>coming in today?

105
00:06:57,606 --> 00:06:58,736
I don't know
what you mean

106
00:06:58,742 --> 00:07:01,732
Look, I demanded
ask her one question

107
00:07:02,062 --> 00:07:03,744
Does the corporate
master rape

108
00:07:03,755 --> 00:07:04,872
Oh my god!

109
00:07:07,045 --> 00:07:12,138
That's so
horrifying! Horrible

110
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,714
Horrible person!

111
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:20,463
So do you think we can keepa lid on this for
now I don't want to worry people unnecessarily.

112
00:07:20,485 --> 00:07:25,090
No, absolutely. Under this regime,
it will not leave this office.

113
00:07:26,211 --> 00:07:28,684
So what is downsizing
actually mean?

114
00:07:28,831 --> 00:07:29,474
Well

115
00:07:29,679 --> 00:07:32,589
You guys gotta update your
resume, just like I'm doing.

116
00:07:32,664 --> 00:07:36,166
I bet it's gonna
be me, probably.

117
00:07:36,732 --> 00:07:37,886
Yeah, it'll be you

118
00:07:37,995 --> 00:07:39,322
I have an important
question for you.

119
00:07:39,344 --> 00:07:39,943
Yes

120
00:07:41,285 --> 00:07:43,275
Are you going to engelate
<?the cup brains?> on Sunday?

121
00:07:43,304 --> 00:07:46,079
Yeah, stop.
That's ridiculous.

122
00:07:46,176 --> 00:07:49,327
Am I gonna tell them? No I'm not going to
tell them, I don't see the point of that.

123
00:07:49,555 --> 00:07:52,723
As a doctor you would not tell
a patient if they had cancer.

124
00:07:55,003 --> 00:07:55,956
This is Mister Scott.

125
00:07:58,218 --> 00:07:59,843
Ryan Howard from
the temp agency

126
00:08:00,431 --> 00:08:01,923
<?Ted Nickels?> set
me down to start today

127
00:08:01,961 --> 00:08:04,396
Howard, like Moe
Howard, Three Stooges?

128
00:08:11,045 --> 00:08:14,884
Right here, my vibe. Oh
Pam, that's a guy thing Pam.

129
00:08:15,353 --> 00:08:17,186
I'm sort of a
student in comedy

130
00:08:27,735 --> 00:08:29,977
I'm Hitler, Adolph Hitler

131
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,234
I don't think it would be the
worst thing if they let me go.

132
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,835
Because then I might

133
00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:41,781
It's just, I don't think it's many
girls dream to be a receptionist.

134
00:08:42,935 --> 00:08:44,453
I like to do
illustrations,

135
00:08:46,524 --> 00:08:49,650
mostly water color,
a few oil pencil.

136
00:08:51,167 --> 00:08:52,939
Jim thinks they're good.

137
00:08:52,995 --> 00:08:54,614
Dundler Mifflin
this is Pam.

138
00:08:54,731 --> 00:08:57,517
Sure, Mr. Davis, let
me call you right back.

139
00:08:57,635 --> 00:09:00,875
Yeah, some just came up, two
minutes. Thank you very much.

140
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,663
Dwight, what
are you doing?

141
00:09:02,785 --> 00:09:03,088
- What?

142
00:09:03,097 --> 00:09:04,167
- What are you doing?

143
00:09:04,185 --> 00:09:06,345
Just clearing my desk,
I can't concentrate

144
00:09:06,358 --> 00:09:07,455
- It's not on your desk.

145
00:09:07,462 --> 00:09:08,228
- It's overlapping.

146
00:09:08,255 --> 00:09:09,853
It's all coming
over the edge.

147
00:09:10,364 --> 00:09:13,222
One word, two
syllables : demarcation.

148
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:22,867
- You can't do that.

149
00:09:23,045 --> 00:09:24,213
- Why not?

150
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:29,015
Safety violation, I could
fall and pierce, and organ.

151
00:09:29,991 --> 00:09:31,247
We'll see

152
00:09:35,326 --> 00:09:38,202
This is why the whole downsizing
thing just doesn't bother me.

153
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:39,687
Downsizing?

154
00:09:40,275 --> 00:09:45,148
I have no problem with that. I have been
recommending downsizing since Halpert got here

155
00:09:45,817 --> 00:09:47,582
even brought it
up on my interview.

156
00:09:48,086 --> 00:09:50,517
I say, bring it on!

157
00:09:51,235 --> 00:09:55,423
You just still have messages for
yesterday. Relax everything is under control

158
00:09:56,418 --> 00:09:59,295
Yeah, yeah, yeah oh
that's important, right.

159
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:02,999
Oh, this is so important,
I should run to answer it.

160
00:10:23,069 --> 00:10:23,747
What?

161
00:10:23,949 --> 00:10:28,057
Come on. Six million
dollars man, Steve Austin,

162
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:32,730
actually that would be a good salary for
me don't you think? Six million dollars?

163
00:10:32,908 --> 00:10:35,137
Memo to Jan: I
deserve a raise

164
00:10:35,891 --> 00:10:37,027
Don't we all?

165
00:10:37,233 --> 00:10:38,529
I'm sorry?

166
00:10:39,515 --> 00:10:40,660
There's nothing!

167
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:45,892
If you are unhappy with your compensation,
maybe you should take it up with HR,

168
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:51,377
ok? Not today, ok? Pam
just, be professional.

169
00:10:56,741 --> 00:11:00,093
I think I'm a role model here, I
think I garner other people respect.

170
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:05,650
Attention on Dundler Mifflin employees, please
we have a meeting in the conference room ASAP

171
00:11:05,654 --> 00:11:10,589
People I respect, heros
of mine, would be Bob Hope,

172
00:11:13,294 --> 00:11:17,329
Abraham Lincoln,
definitely,

173
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:20,861
Bono,

174
00:11:22,085 --> 00:11:26,647
and probably God
be the fourth one.

175
00:11:27,969 --> 00:11:35,513
And I just think all those people
really helped the world, in so many ways,

176
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:41,580
that it's, it's
really beyond words.

177
00:11:43,675 --> 00:11:45,488
It's really uncalculable.

178
00:11:45,835 --> 00:11:49,131
Now, I know there's some rumors out
there, and I just kind want to see.

179
00:11:49,187 --> 00:11:50,941
I'm assistant regional
manager, I should know first.

180
00:11:50,975 --> 00:11:52,345
Assistant to the
regional manager.

181
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:54,600
Ok. Can you just
tell me please?

182
00:11:54,783 --> 00:11:56,521
Just a whisper in my ear.

183
00:11:54,783 --> 00:11:56,521
I'm about to
tell everybody.

184
00:11:56,694 --> 00:11:58,638
I'm just about
to tell exeryone

185
00:11:58,722 --> 00:11:59,793
Please, ok.

186
00:11:59,861 --> 00:12:00,759
Do you want me
to tell them?

187
00:12:01,006 --> 00:12:02,608
You don't know
what it is!

188
00:12:03,435 --> 00:12:04,870
Can you tell them,
with my permission?

189
00:12:04,898 --> 00:12:05,941
I don't need your...

190
00:12:05,242 --> 00:12:06,505
Permission
granted. Go ahead

191
00:12:06,564 --> 00:12:12,236
Corporate has deemed it appropriate
to enforce an ultimatum upon me,

192
00:12:12,575 --> 00:12:18,172
and Jan is thinking about downsizing
either the Stanford branch or this branch.

193
00:12:18,227 --> 00:12:20,549
I heard they might be
closing this branch down,

194
00:12:20,746 --> 00:12:21,741
That's just...

195
00:12:23,282 --> 00:12:25,791
That's just the rumor going around this
is my first day I don't really know.

196
00:12:25,924 --> 00:12:27,841
Yeah, but Michael what
if they downsize here?

197
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:29,116
Not gonna happen

198
00:12:29,184 --> 00:12:30,458
It could be out of
your hands, Michael

199
00:12:30,477 --> 00:12:33,493
It won't be out of
my hands, Stanley, ok?

200
00:12:33,635 --> 00:12:34,365
I promise you that.

201
00:12:34,499 --> 00:12:35,581
Can you promise that?

202
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:36,929
On his mother's grave.

203
00:12:40,244 --> 00:12:45,647
Well yeah it is a promise, and frankly I'm a little
bit insulted that you have to keep asking about it.

204
00:12:45,734 --> 00:12:47,527
It's just that
we need to know

205
00:12:48,995 --> 00:12:52,128
Hold on a second, I think Pam
wanted to say something, Pam?

206
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:57,756
You had a look that you wanted
to ask a question, just then?

207
00:12:59,277 --> 00:13:04,201
I was in the meeting with Jan and she did said
that it could be this branch that gets the axe.

208
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:05,889
Are you sure about that?

209
00:13:07,492 --> 00:13:12,833
Pam? Maybe you should stick to the ongoing
confidentiality agreement of meetings.

210
00:13:12,861 --> 00:13:15,266
Pam, information
is power.

211
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:18,370
So you can't say for sure whether
it's gotta to be us or them.

212
00:13:18,395 --> 00:13:22,617
No no, no Stanley, no you did
not see me in there with her.

213
00:13:23,087 --> 00:13:30,548
I said, if corporate wants to come in here, and
interfere then they're gonna have to go through me, right?

214
00:13:30,631 --> 00:13:32,815
You know, you can go a
mess with Josh's people,

215
00:13:32,866 --> 00:13:34,637
but I'm the head
of this family,

216
00:13:34,764 --> 00:13:38,326
and you ain't gonna be
messing with my children.

217
00:13:44,917 --> 00:13:50,873
If I left, what would I do with all
this useless information in my head?

218
00:13:51,035 --> 00:13:54,818
You know, tonnage
price of minal folders?

219
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:59,317
Pam's favorite flavor of
yoghourt, which is mix berry.

220
00:14:03,707 --> 00:14:05,893
Jim said mix berries?

221
00:14:08,344 --> 00:14:09,826
Yeah he's under me

222
00:14:13,035 --> 00:14:15,974
Watch out for this guy Dwight
Schrute in the building!

223
00:14:16,011 --> 00:14:17,044
This is Ryan,
the new temp.

224
00:14:17,549 --> 00:14:18,315
Nice to meet you.

225
00:14:18,338 --> 00:14:19,874
Introduce
yourself, be polite

226
00:14:19,931 --> 00:14:21,871
Dwight Schrute, Assistant
Regional Manager.

227
00:14:21,909 --> 00:14:23,864
Assistant to the
Regional Manager.

228
00:14:24,153 --> 00:14:28,596
So Dwight tell him about the kung
fu, and the car and everything.

229
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:33,737
Yeah, I got a 78-2-8 <?daisy?>, I've bought her
for 1200, fixed it up, now worth three grand.

230
00:14:33,751 --> 00:14:34,857
That is his profit!

231
00:14:34,973 --> 00:14:38,242
New engine, suspension
I've got some photos

232
00:14:40,276 --> 00:14:41,430
Damn it!

233
00:14:41,989 --> 00:14:43,551
Ok, hold on,

234
00:14:43,695 --> 00:14:45,996
Judge is in cession.
What is the problem here?

235
00:14:46,207 --> 00:14:48,066
He put my stuff
in jello again.

236
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:52,709
That's rough
professional, thanks

237
00:14:52,745 --> 00:14:55,036
That's the third time and it
wasn't funny the first time.

238
00:14:55,047 --> 00:15:00,042
It's ok here, but people some how is
taking advantage because it's so relaxed.

239
00:15:00,406 --> 00:15:03,971
I'm a volunteer sheriff's
deputy on the week ends,

240
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,619
and you cannot
screw around there.

241
00:15:07,014 --> 00:15:09,071
It's one of the rules.

242
00:15:09,164 --> 00:15:09,681
What is that?

243
00:15:09,699 --> 00:15:10,685
That's my stapler.

244
00:15:10,693 --> 00:15:12,956
No no no, do
not take it out!

245
00:15:13,175 --> 00:15:14,263
You have to eat
it out there,

246
00:15:14,452 --> 00:15:16,357
because there are starving
people in the world,

247
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:19,505
and which I hate, and it is
a waste of that kind of food.

248
00:15:19,222 --> 00:15:20,550
Ok, you know what?
You can be a witness.

249
00:15:20,565 --> 00:15:21,982
Can you reprimand
him please?

250
00:15:24,005 --> 00:15:25,010
- How do you
know it was me?

251
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:26,086
- It's always you.

252
00:15:26,161 --> 00:15:27,363
- Are you gonna
discipline him or not?

253
00:15:27,376 --> 00:15:29,730
Ooh discipline, kinky!

254
00:15:30,057 --> 00:15:32,452
All right, here's
the deal you guys

255
00:15:32,646 --> 00:15:36,896
the thing about practical jokes, is that you have
to know when to start, as well as when to stop!

256
00:15:37,257 --> 00:15:44,852
And yeah, Jim, now is the time to stop
pulling Dwight's personal effects into jello.

257
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:51,681
Ok, Dwight I'm sorry because,
I've always been your biggest Flam

258
00:15:54,295 --> 00:15:57,488
Nice, that's the
way it is around here

259
00:15:58,567 --> 00:16:01,103
You should have put
him in custard-y!

260
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:03,927
Yes, new guy!

261
00:16:04,281 --> 00:16:05,806
He scores !

262
00:16:05,815 --> 00:16:07,463
Ok that's great, I guess,

263
00:16:07,488 --> 00:16:09,257
what I'm most
concerned with is...

264
00:16:09,582 --> 00:16:11,156
damage to
company property.

265
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:12,782
That's all.

266
00:16:17,075 --> 00:16:19,667
Pudding

267
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:23,319
I'm trying to think,
another desert to do.

268
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:27,701
Do you like to going out at
the end of a week for a drink?

269
00:16:28,385 --> 00:16:29,127
Yeah!

270
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:32,604
Oh, that's why we all going out, so
we can have an end of the week drink!

271
00:16:32,685 --> 00:16:33,729
well then when
are we going out?

272
00:16:33,729 --> 00:16:35,091
I don't know,
tonight, hopefully.

273
00:16:35,091 --> 00:16:36,757
Ok, yeah.

274
00:16:39,658 --> 00:16:40,144
Hey man!

275
00:16:40,189 --> 00:16:40,688
Hey!

276
00:16:40,619 --> 00:16:41,517
What's going on?

277
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:42,235
Hey baby!

278
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:46,694
Roy is my fiancé, we've
been engaged about...

279
00:16:47,456 --> 00:16:51,530
about 3 years, and we were supposed
to get married in September,

280
00:16:51,905 --> 00:16:54,602
but I think we'll gonna
get married in next spring

281
00:16:55,695 --> 00:16:58,374
Do you mind if I go out
for a drink with these guys?

282
00:16:59,547 --> 00:17:02,608
No, come on. Let's get
out of here and go home.

283
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:06,188
Ok, I will be out in a
few minutes so it's lame

284
00:17:06,788 --> 00:17:10,111
twenty past five I've
still to do my faxes.

285
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:15,992
You know you
should come with us,

286
00:17:16,323 --> 00:17:19,187
because you know we are going out and
it could be a good chance for you to

287
00:17:19,568 --> 00:17:22,701
see what people are like outside
the office, I think it could be fun

288
00:17:22,965 --> 00:17:26,505
No, it sounds good but
seriously we gotta get going

289
00:17:26,525 --> 00:17:27,104
Yeah

290
00:17:38,947 --> 00:17:41,028
What's in the bag?

291
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:43,326
Just tell her i'll
talk to her then

292
00:17:43,327 --> 00:17:46,585
No definitely all right
dude awesome, we'll do

293
00:17:50,394 --> 00:17:54,879
Do I think I'll be
invited to the wedding?

294
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:04,881
So, have you
felt vibe yet?

295
00:18:05,177 --> 00:18:06,606
We work hard,
we play hard.

296
00:18:06,673 --> 00:18:09,365
Sometimes we play hard when we
should be working hard, right?

297
00:18:10,357 --> 00:18:15,455
I guess the atmosphere that I've
created here is that I am a friend first,

298
00:18:15,662 --> 00:18:17,006
and a boss second.

299
00:18:17,282 --> 00:18:19,942
Probably an
entertainer third.

300
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:20,721
Just a second

301
00:18:21,314 --> 00:18:22,025
Right?

302
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:27,416
Oh, hey do you like the
Jamie Kennedy Experiment?

303
00:18:27,457 --> 00:18:27,723
Yeah

304
00:18:27,743 --> 00:18:29,403
Punk'd, and all
that kind of stuff?

305
00:18:30,546 --> 00:18:32,983
You are going to be my complice,
just go on with that ok?

306
00:18:33,013 --> 00:18:33,298
All right

307
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:35,711
Just follow my lead,
don't pimp me all right?

308
00:18:35,831 --> 00:18:36,625
Come in!

309
00:18:36,942 --> 00:18:39,805
So corporate just said
that I don't want to

310
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:40,142
you got a fax

311
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:41,195
Oh thank you Pam

312
00:18:41,196 --> 00:18:43,316
Pam? Can you come
in here for a sec?

313
00:18:43,864 --> 00:18:48,120
Just have a seat, I was gonna
call you in anyway, you know Ryan?

314
00:18:49,623 --> 00:18:53,050
As you know, there is
going to be downsizing

315
00:18:53,134 --> 00:18:57,642
and you have made my
life so much easier,

316
00:18:58,122 --> 00:19:02,114
in that I'm going to
have to let you go first

317
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:03,977
What? Why?

318
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:07,517
Why? Well, theft,
and stealing

319
00:19:07,658 --> 00:19:08,757
Stealing?

320
00:19:09,489 --> 00:19:12,578
What am I suppose
to have stolen?

321
00:19:12,879 --> 00:19:14,259
Post-It notes.

322
00:19:14,908 --> 00:19:15,537
Post-It notes...?

323
00:19:16,199 --> 00:19:17,626
Worth of those
like 50 cents?

324
00:19:18,602 --> 00:19:21,365
You steal a thousand Post-It
notes at 50cents a piece,

325
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:24,909
then you know you've
made a profit margin.

326
00:19:26,092 --> 00:19:27,805
Resell of business Pam

327
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,172
- Are you serious?

328
00:19:30,562 --> 00:19:31,516
- Yeah.

329
00:19:33,603 --> 00:19:35,552
I can't believe
this, I mean,

330
00:19:35,565 --> 00:19:39,831
I have never even stolen as much as
a paper clip and you're firing me.

331
00:19:40,535 --> 00:19:42,748
And the best thing
about it is that

332
00:19:43,055 --> 00:19:45,917
we are not gonna have to
give you any severance pay,

333
00:19:46,648 --> 00:19:50,396
because that is
gross misconduct, and

334
00:19:50,721 --> 00:19:53,621
just clean out your
desk. I'm sorry.

335
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:13,363
You've been X'd punk'd!

336
00:20:13,457 --> 00:20:17,453
Surprise it's a joke, we
were joking around, you see?

337
00:20:17,659 --> 00:20:21,707
Ok, he was in on he
was my accomplice and

338
00:20:21,917 --> 00:20:24,450
there was cascand
around booster thing, and

339
00:20:24,555 --> 00:20:30,747
we were showing the new guy around the
kind of, to give him the field of place, so

340
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,999
God, you were, we
totally got you

341
00:20:34,009 --> 00:20:35,373
you're a jerk

342
00:20:36,615 --> 00:20:38,914
Well, I don't
know about that

343
00:20:54,114 --> 00:20:57,136
What is the most important
thing for a company?

344
00:20:57,212 --> 00:21:01,235
Is it the cash flow?
Is it the inventory?

345
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:05,310
No it's the people.

346
00:21:05,656 --> 00:21:07,535
The "people".

347
00:21:08,103 --> 00:21:12,469
My proudest moment here was not
when I increased profits by 17%,

348
00:21:12,637 --> 00:21:16,776
or when I cut expenses without
losing a single employee.

349
00:21:16,793 --> 00:21:18,154
No, no, no, no.

350
00:21:18,453 --> 00:21:21,201
It was a young
Guatemalan guy,

351
00:21:21,514 --> 00:21:24,352
a first job in the country,
barely spoke English,

352
00:21:24,579 --> 00:21:26,597
came to me and said

353
00:21:27,095 --> 00:21:28,290
"Mr Scott,

354
00:21:29,304 --> 00:21:34,148
would you be the
Godfather to my child?"

355
00:21:43,522 --> 00:21:46,407
Didn't work out in the end. We
had to let him go. He sucked.

356
00:21:52,433 --> 00:21:53,707
Hey

357
00:21:53,731 --> 00:21:55,798
Hey how are you?

358
00:21:56,145 --> 00:21:58,533
Good I thought you were
going out for a drink with

359
00:21:58,553 --> 00:21:59,930
Oh no

360
00:22:02,969 --> 00:22:03,880
How's your headache?

361
00:22:04,464 --> 00:22:05,606
Better, thanks.

362
00:22:04,913 --> 00:22:06,165
Good

363
00:22:09,823 --> 00:22:11,133
Are you

364
00:22:11,962 --> 00:22:12,900
Walking out?

365
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:13,732
Yes

366
00:22:14,384 --> 00:22:15,892
Yes do you wanna?

367
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:16,833
Yeah

368
00:22:16,867 --> 00:22:17,939
Great, let me just

369
00:22:19,515 --> 00:22:20,443
Oh Roy

370
00:22:20,445 --> 00:22:22,766
Yeah, listen have
a nice week-end!

371
00:22:22,847 --> 00:22:26,058
Yeah definitely
you too! Enjoy it

372
00:22:39,848 --> 00:22:40,641
Come here

373
00:22:49,539 --> 00:22:51,716
The World's Best Boss
