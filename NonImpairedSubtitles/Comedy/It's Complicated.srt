cut at the hairline.

We make
an incision right here

228

and then we
pull the skin back

a little tighter
over your skull

00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,486
ADAM: Uh... I, I think
our next step is to
stake out the addition

640
00:30:39,596 --> 00:30:40,858
and see how it
feels size-wise.

641
00:30:40,931 --> 00:30:42,159
Yeah, that would be great.

642
00:30:42,266 --> 00:30:44,461
So, I will email you
and we'll set something up.

643
00:30:44,568 --> 00:30:45,830
Sounds great.

644
00:30:45,936 --> 00:30:47,631
Jake, nice meeting you.

645
00:30:47,704 --> 00:30:49,331
Yeah, you, too.

646
00:30:50,908 --> 00:30:52,637
Got time for
a cup of coffee?

647
00:30:52,709 --> 00:30:53,903
JANE: Sure.

648
00:31:01,185 --> 00:31:03,745
Why haven't you returned
any of my calls or emails?

649
00:31:03,821 --> 00:31:08,417
Jake, come on!
This is just too weird.

650
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:14,491
We have to just never do
what we did ever again.

651
00:31:14,598 --> 00:31:15,622
(INHALES)

652
00:31:15,699 --> 00:31:18,031
You are
an adulterer and I am

653
00:31:18,135 --> 00:31:20,035
an awful person, basically.

654
00:31:20,137 --> 00:31:22,765
(VOICE QUIVERING)
I haven't slept in days.

655
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:26,674
What we did was so wrong
on so many Ivies.

656
00:31:26,777 --> 00:31:29,473
And it was so right
on a coupe of Ivies, too.

657
00:31:29,546 --> 00:31:30,672
Admit it.

658
00:31:30,747 --> 00:31:31,839
No, it wasn't.

659
00:31:31,949 --> 00:31:33,678
On no Ivies was it right.

660
00:31:33,784 --> 00:31:36,548
You can't say
we didn't enjoy
each other's company.

661
00:31:36,653 --> 00:31:38,883
Sitting at the bar, dancing.

662
00:31:39,456 --> 00:31:41,151
After dancing. Come on.

663
00:31:41,225 --> 00:31:43,352
You and I haven't
had fun like that
in a 100 years.

664
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:47,362
Yes,
because we're not supposed
to have fun like that.

665
00:31:47,464 --> 00:31:49,455
We are divorced.

666
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,299
(SIGHING DEEPLY)

667
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:55,828
Are you, like,
what, unhappy at home?
Does she not understand you?

668
00:31:55,906 --> 00:31:59,205
Or did you just want
to know what it would be
like with someone my age?

669
00:31:59,309 --> 00:32:00,674
What is this?

670
00:32:00,744 --> 00:32:03,178
I'd be lying
if I said I never
think about you, Janey.

671
00:32:03,247 --> 00:32:06,239
I think about you a lot.

672
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:10,650
And, no, it's not
perfect at home, obviously.
Look at me.

673
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:13,519
I've got three grown kids
and I'm going to
kindergarten interviews.

674
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:15,080
I'm a waking cliché.

675
00:32:15,192 --> 00:32:18,719
And I can't, literally,
can't stop thinking

676
00:32:18,795 --> 00:32:21,025
about what happened
in New York.

677
00:32:21,098 --> 00:32:25,262
Fate brought us
together once,
maybe it happened again.

678
00:32:25,369 --> 00:32:29,100
And I know you've moved on
with your life, I get it.

679
00:32:29,206 --> 00:32:33,336
But you can't deny that
something real and honest
happened that night.

680
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:36,004
Can't we just go with it?
See where it takes us?

681
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,876
No one has to know.

682
00:32:37,948 --> 00:32:38,972
(CHUCKLES) Wow.

683
00:32:39,049 --> 00:32:41,882
You were so great,
so loose and sexy.

684
00:32:41,952 --> 00:32:44,921
How often do you get
to be like that?

685
00:32:45,022 --> 00:32:47,115
You can run and
open restaurants

686
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:49,852
and build your
perfect kitchen.

687
00:32:49,927 --> 00:32:55,058
But what about
having someone to hold you
in the middle of the night?

688
00:32:55,132 --> 00:32:57,623
Not high on
my list these days.

689
00:32:57,734 --> 00:33:00,430
What if that
someone is someone
who's known you

690
00:33:00,537 --> 00:33:02,368
since you were 23?

691
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,030
And loved you

692
00:33:06,076 --> 00:33:07,771
for most of your life.

693
00:33:08,045 --> 00:33:09,945
Oh, man!

694
00:33:12,049 --> 00:33:14,916
I forgot what
a good lawyer you are.

695
00:33:14,985 --> 00:33:17,283
Give this a shot, Janey.

696
00:33:17,821 --> 00:33:20,221
Life is short
and it's tough.

697
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,588
Don't discount what
we have together.

698
00:33:22,659 --> 00:33:24,286
You know what they say,

699
00:33:24,394 --> 00:33:27,488
''People who live
in nursing homes that
have plants live longer

700
00:33:28,332 --> 00:33:30,391
''than the people
without plants.''

701
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:33,959
So you're saying
this is a healthy
choice for me?

702
00:33:34,071 --> 00:33:37,063
Honey, I know it is.

703
00:33:39,409 --> 00:33:40,501
(LAUGHS)

704
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,476
(JANE BREATHES HEAVILY)

705
00:33:47,584 --> 00:33:49,176
(JANE GROANS)

706
00:33:50,087 --> 00:33:53,853
Oh, God! Oh, God!
It's official.

707
00:33:53,957 --> 00:33:56,653
(WHIMPERS) We're
having an affair.

708
00:33:57,294 --> 00:33:59,592
Why do you need
to label everything?

709
00:33:59,663 --> 00:34:03,099
Because that's what this is.

710
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:07,193
Yes,
in its crassest form maybe,
if we were two other people.

711
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:10,329
Just because we were
married for 19 years

712
00:34:10,407 --> 00:34:12,807
does not not
make this an affair.

713
00:34:12,876 --> 00:34:18,337
Okay, but since we
were together for so long,
it's not really that wrong.

714
00:34:18,448 --> 00:34:21,713
Really? You want to run
that logic by your wife?

715
00:34:27,124 --> 00:34:28,716
(CHUCKLES)

716
00:34:29,459 --> 00:34:31,222
Okay, will you
do me a favor?

717
00:34:31,328 --> 00:34:32,420
You're on my side.
Can we switch?

718
00:34:32,496 --> 00:34:35,693
I'm feeling a little,
uh, disoriented.

719
00:34:35,799 --> 00:34:37,699
Since when is
this your side?
Since 10 years ago.

720
00:34:37,801 --> 00:34:39,632
Come on, just... Please?

721
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:41,398
(BOTH GRUNTING)

722
00:34:42,572 --> 00:34:44,062
Can I interest
you in a little...

723
00:34:44,174 --> 00:34:46,005
(CHUCKLES) No.

724
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:56,083
Why do you think
the sex is so much
sexier this time?

725
00:34:57,087 --> 00:34:58,714
I don't know.

726
00:35:03,727 --> 00:35:06,218
(LAUGHS) I got to go to work.

727
00:35:06,663 --> 00:35:09,723
Okay. Me, too.

728
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:20,933
You see what happens
when you're not
looking out for me.

729
00:35:21,044 --> 00:35:24,536
She lets me eat everything.
Pasta, cream cheese.

730
00:35:24,614 --> 00:35:25,740
(SCOFFS)

731
00:35:25,849 --> 00:35:28,579
Would you hand me
my robe, please?

732
00:35:28,685 --> 00:35:30,346
(CHUCKLES)

733
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,945
And, um, turn around.

734
00:35:33,056 --> 00:35:35,616
(SCOFFS) Why do
I have to, uh,
turn around?

735
00:35:35,725 --> 00:35:37,056
Because the last
time you saw me

736
00:35:37,127 --> 00:35:40,062
standing up naked
I was in my 40s.

737
00:35:41,565 --> 00:35:44,534
Things look different
lying down. Just...

738
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:46,694
(CHUCKLES) You've
gotten kind of nuts.

739
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:49,034
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.
You know what, Jake,

740
00:35:49,106 --> 00:35:50,903
I think it would be
really good for us

741
00:35:50,974 --> 00:35:54,569
to just not talk
for a couple of days.

742
00:35:54,644 --> 00:35:57,738
You know what I think,
just for the record?

743
00:35:58,482 --> 00:36:00,916
I think we're
doing something
kind of brilliant.

744
00:36:00,984 --> 00:36:03,714
All the things
that tore us apart
aren't issues anymore.

745
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:07,814
I'd say our problems
actually went away.

746
00:36:07,924 --> 00:36:08,982
(LAUGHS) What?

747
00:36:09,092 --> 00:36:11,390
Didn't you always say
you felt you weren't
being heard?

748
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:13,224
Wasn't that our big issue?

749
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:16,629
Both of us always
feeling rejected
and unappreciated.

750
00:36:16,733 --> 00:36:19,793
Look at us now.
You're so much
more together.

751
00:36:20,604 --> 00:36:22,003
You're not exhausted
all the time.

752
00:36:22,105 --> 00:36:23,265
You're not catering
every weekend

753
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,035
or busy all day
with the kids.

754
00:36:25,108 --> 00:36:28,339
And I'm calmer.
Not as obsessed with work.

755
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:31,138
I'm a partner. I'm there.

756
00:36:31,248 --> 00:36:34,740
We both grew into the people
we wanted each other to be.

757
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:36,080
Really?

758
00:36:37,154 --> 00:36:41,022
Well, you're better
than I am at remembering
all the details of our...

759
00:36:41,124 --> 00:36:43,456
Do you remember never
having time for sex?

760
00:36:43,527 --> 00:36:44,994
(LAUGHS) Now look at us.

761
00:36:45,095 --> 00:36:48,030
We've already done
it two times this week
and it's only Tuesday.

762
00:36:48,131 --> 00:36:50,656
I swear to God,
if half the people
who got divorced

763
00:36:50,767 --> 00:36:52,598
got back together
after 10 years,

764
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:54,830
their problems
would be solved.

765
00:36:54,938 --> 00:36:56,166
I think we're
on to something.

766
00:36:56,273 --> 00:36:58,867
(CHUCKLES) Not sure
I agree with that.

767
00:36:58,942 --> 00:37:00,910
And, also, we are
not back together.

768
00:37:00,977 --> 00:37:04,140
And I know other
divorced people
think about this.

769
00:37:04,214 --> 00:37:06,205
They wonder, ''What if?''

770
00:37:06,983 --> 00:37:11,044
You know,
I think this is
very French of us.

771
00:37:11,154 --> 00:37:14,521
(LAUGHS) How is
it French of us?

772
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:19,527
I have a young wife
but I am having sex
with my old wife.

773
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:25,130
Not old. You know, ''ex.''
I didn't mean ''old.''

774
00:37:26,803 --> 00:37:27,963
You're doing that
thing when you act

775
00:37:28,038 --> 00:37:29,164
like you're not
listening to me,

776
00:37:29,239 --> 00:37:32,140
but think about
what I said, okay?

777
00:37:32,209 --> 00:37:33,540
You got any of
your homemade
granola here?

778
00:37:33,643 --> 00:37:35,338
It's been so long
since I had any.

779
00:37:35,412 --> 00:37:36,504
Oh, you miss it?

780
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:37,638
So much.

781
00:37:37,714 --> 00:37:40,182
We sell it for 6.50
a bag at the store.

782
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:44,243
(CHUCKLES) Yeah,
well, why give it away
when you can...

783
00:37:44,354 --> 00:37:45,787
(GASPS) God!

784
00:37:45,855 --> 00:37:47,117
Ooh. Kiss goodbye?

785
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,384
Mmm.

786
00:37:48,491 --> 00:37:52,484
(CHUCKLING) Ooh!
She wants to be courted.

787
00:37:53,196 --> 00:37:56,222
I can do that.
Oh, honey,
thanks for the coffee.

788
00:37:56,333 --> 00:37:57,698
Oh, God!

789
00:37:58,034 --> 00:38:00,093
(WOMEN CHATTERING)

790
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:05,274
Oh, my God! Now what?

791
00:38:05,375 --> 00:38:07,900
(GASPS) Three pies?

00:44:25,855 --> 00:44:27,755
Really?
(LAUGHING) Yeah.

952
00:44:42,038 --> 00:44:45,269
I know it's none
of my business,
but I was just

953
00:44:45,375 --> 00:44:48,401
trying to figure out
why someone like you
is divorced.

954
00:44:48,478 --> 00:44:50,207
And what did
you come up with?

955
00:44:50,279 --> 00:44:52,747
Something in the
''you're too nice''
department.

956
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:55,784
That, and my wife
fell in love with
my best friend.

957
00:44:55,885 --> 00:44:58,445
Oh! No.
Ex-best friend.

958
00:44:58,554 --> 00:45:01,284
We were on a biking trip,
he and his wife
and me and my wife,

959
00:45:01,391 --> 00:45:04,554
through Tuscany,
and on the last day
of the trip,

960
00:45:04,627 --> 00:45:05,992
they announced that
they were in love.

961
00:45:06,095 --> 00:45:08,086
(EXHALES) How awful!

962
00:45:08,164 --> 00:45:09,461
Not a great
plane ride home.

963
00:45:09,532 --> 00:45:12,000
Oh! I can just imagine.

964
00:45:12,101 --> 00:45:13,864
Sitting there
for hours and hours

965
00:45:13,936 --> 00:45:15,767
with your wife,
who you know is...

966
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:16,862
Oh, that's rough.

967
00:45:16,939 --> 00:45:18,429
Well, actually,
they went on to Venice.

968
00:45:18,508 --> 00:45:20,635
I flew home with Carol,
that's his ex-wife.

969
00:45:20,743 --> 00:45:23,769
And you can't
imagine what it's like
sitting next to someone

970
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:26,474
who's crying on a plane
for 10 straight hours.

971
00:45:26,582 --> 00:45:27,674
(CHUCKLES) I don't blame her.

972
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:28,774
I'm talking about me.

973
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:31,081
(LAUGHS)

974
00:45:31,154 --> 00:45:32,178
But anyway,
they're married now,

975
00:45:32,255 --> 00:45:34,985
and it's pretty much
an ongoing awful thing.

976
00:45:35,091 --> 00:45:36,718
But you and your ex,
when he stopped by

977
00:45:36,793 --> 00:45:38,283
the other morning
for coffee,

978
00:45:38,361 --> 00:45:40,921
I thought, ''Wow.
That's the way
it's supposed to be.''

979
00:45:40,997 --> 00:45:42,760
You two really seem
to have it figured out.

980
00:45:42,832 --> 00:45:46,427
Well... Yeah.
We're not as figured out
as you'd think.

981
00:46:00,817 --> 00:46:02,717
(ADAM AND JANE LAUGHllNG)

982
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:07,622
I hope you don't think
that I've been
interrogating you,

983
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:10,989
but I know what
it's like to have
an ex who's remarried

984
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:13,858
and not have that much
going on in that area.

985
00:46:13,963 --> 00:46:17,228
I mean,
do you date ever? Or...

986
00:46:17,333 --> 00:46:19,733
Oh, constantly, actually.

987
00:46:19,836 --> 00:46:20,860
(CHUCKLES)
Constantly? Really?

988
00:46:20,937 --> 00:46:22,199
Yeah. Everyone I know

989
00:46:22,305 --> 00:46:24,205
or have ever known
has fixed me up

990
00:46:24,273 --> 00:46:25,570
and sometimes
I just meet women.

991
00:46:25,641 --> 00:46:27,632
I don't really know
how it happens, but...

992
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:30,508
(CHUCKLING) But
no girlfriend yet?

993
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:31,638
Not yet.

994
00:46:31,714 --> 00:46:33,682
Mmm-hmm.
Just like dating.

995
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:36,184
Actually, I find it
really stressful.

996
00:46:36,252 --> 00:46:39,415
The last time I was
in the dating world
was 1978.

997
00:46:39,522 --> 00:46:40,546
(CHUCKLES)

998
00:46:40,656 --> 00:46:41,850
And it's a lot more
complicated these days.

999
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:42,982
(CHUCKLES) Oh, I know.

1000
00:46:43,059 --> 00:46:44,083
I can't tell you
how nice it is

1001
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,525
to have a conversation
with a woman

1002
00:46:45,595 --> 00:46:49,429
and have the pressure off,
not to mention
a home-cooked...

1003
00:46:49,532 --> 00:46:51,261
(CHUCKLES) That was
a compliment.

1004
00:46:51,367 --> 00:46:52,925
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

1005
00:46:53,035 --> 00:46:55,196
Do you have a guy
in your life at,
at the moment?

1006
00:46:55,271 --> 00:46:57,034
No.
No?

1007
00:46:57,106 --> 00:46:59,074
(CHUCKLES) No.

(EXCLAIMS)

1012
00:47:29,472 --> 00:47:31,633
This was so nice
and relaxing.

1013
00:47:31,741 --> 00:47:34,539
And the lavender ice cream
was the best dessert
of any sort

1014
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:36,578
I've ever had,
like, in my life.

1015
00:47:36,646 --> 00:47:37,840
Aw! Oh! Thanks.

1016
00:47:37,914 --> 00:47:39,882
I always make ice cream
when I can't sleep,

1017
00:47:39,949 --> 00:47:41,473
so I'm glad someone
was here to eat it.

(CHUCKLES)

1019

Great getting to
know you a little.

00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:47,221
Yeah, it was really fun.

Hello, Jane.
(CHUCKLES) Hi.

1032
00:48:28,097 --> 00:48:29,826
You're looking very
beautiful tonight.

(MOANS)

1034

Oh, I love when you
smell like butter.

1035
00:48:32,602 --> 00:48:33,933
What are you doing here?

1036
00:48:34,003 --> 00:48:35,334
Missed you.
Mmm-hmm.

1037
00:48:35,438 --> 00:48:38,373
It's 9:00.
Where does your wife
think you are?

1038
00:48:38,708 --> 00:48:41,802
Yoga. Shall we do some
downward facing dog,
perhaps?

1039
00:48:41,878 --> 00:48:43,971
(CHUCKLING)
Not tonight, big guy.

1040
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:45,377
(CHUCKLES) Is it really
necessary for you

1041
00:48:45,448 --> 00:48:48,110
to always say no
before you say yes?

1042
00:48:48,184 --> 00:48:49,811
I'm not gonna think
less of you, you know.

1043
00:48:49,886 --> 00:48:52,184
Really, Jake.
I'm a little tired

1044
00:48:52,255 --> 00:48:54,621
and I was gonna
take a bath, and just...

1045
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:57,625
Okay. So we'll
just hang out.

1046
00:48:57,693 --> 00:49:00,161
(GASPS) Is that
croque-monsieur?

1047
00:49:00,229 --> 00:49:01,287
Yeah.

1048
00:49:01,364 --> 00:49:03,389
Whose plate is this,
yours or his?
(CHUCKLES) That's mine.

00:49:05,902 --> 00:49:08,302
My God! Just like
I remember it.

1051
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:12,006
Don't you ever eat
at your house?

1052
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:15,532
Pedro dictates most meals,
and he has a very

1053
00:49:15,645 --> 00:49:17,306
limited palate.
Mmm-hmm.

1054
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:18,608
What kind of
ice cream is that?

1055
00:49:18,681 --> 00:49:20,114
Lavender honey.

1056
00:49:20,182 --> 00:49:21,342
Not sleeping?

1057
00:49:21,417 --> 00:49:23,408
Not at all. You?

1058
00:49:24,754 --> 00:49:26,415
Never slept better.
Mmm-hmm.

1059
00:49:26,522 --> 00:49:29,582
And my digestion is
finally back on track.

1060
00:49:29,692 --> 00:49:32,661
You've turned my world
right-side up, Jane.

1061
00:49:33,262 --> 00:49:36,322
You know what
that means, don't you?

1062
00:49:36,399 --> 00:49:38,663
(SIGHS HEAVILY) No.

1063
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:45,005
That I've never
really known how
to live without you.

1064
00:49:52,882 --> 00:49:56,443
You know,
maybe we should be
growing old together.

1065
00:49:56,552 --> 00:50:03,617
(CHUCKLES) I hate
to tell you, big guy,
we already grew old, apart.

1066
00:50:03,726 --> 00:50:04,920
What is with the ''big guy''?

1067
00:50:05,027 --> 00:50:08,724
Is it because I'm fat,
or is it a term
of endearment?

1068
00:50:08,798 --> 00:50:12,632
(CHUCKLING) I have no idea
why I keep saying that.
I'm sorry. I'll stop.

1069
00:50:12,735 --> 00:50:14,100
Thank you.

1070
00:50:15,938 --> 00:50:17,428
I love how quiet
it is in your house.

1071
00:50:17,506 --> 00:50:18,939
Mmm.

1072
00:50:19,942 --> 00:50:23,139
I have no quiet
in my life. Ever.

1073
00:50:23,746 --> 00:50:26,146
Well, you live
with a 5-year-old.

1074
00:50:26,248 --> 00:50:28,478
Yes. And let's
not forget Pedro.

1075
00:50:28,584 --> 00:50:30,381
(LAUGHS)

1076
00:50:32,288 --> 00:50:37,624
What are you saying, exactly?
What's going on over
there at your place?

1077
00:50:38,127 --> 00:50:39,492
(EXHALES)

1078
00:50:41,664 --> 00:50:43,598
My marriage is

1079
00:50:44,734 --> 00:50:47,794
not turning out
as I hoped.
That's obvious.

1080
00:50:47,903 --> 00:50:52,636
Agnes started out
really looking up to me.
We never used to fight.

1081
00:50:52,742 --> 00:50:54,437
But now with
the kid, lately,

1082
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:57,172
we're all about what
school he's going to

1083
00:50:57,279 --> 00:51:00,578
and she thinks we
need a bigger house,
more help.

1084
00:51:00,649 --> 00:51:02,640
I was hoping to
cut back at work,

1085
00:51:02,718 --> 00:51:04,686
but now that's
never gonna happen.

1086
00:51:04,787 --> 00:51:05,811
And she wants to
have another baby

1087
00:51:05,888 --> 00:51:08,379
before Pedro gets
too old, which I get.

1088
00:51:08,457 --> 00:51:11,119
But since we're
always fighting...

1089
00:51:11,227 --> 00:51:13,787
(CHUCKLES) Oh, God.
Listen to me.

1090
00:51:15,164 --> 00:51:18,065
Isn't a baby part of
the deal when you marry
a woman that age?

1091
00:51:18,134 --> 00:51:20,898
Is it? I guess so.

1092
00:51:21,437 --> 00:51:24,770
She's got me booked
at the fertility center
every other day,

1093
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:27,570
and she is so amped up
on hormone injections,

1094
00:51:27,643 --> 00:51:30,407
I'm gonna have
to find an exorcist if
she doesn't calm down.

1095
00:51:30,479 --> 00:51:32,413
(CHUCKLES)

1096
00:51:32,481 --> 00:51:34,346
I wish it was funny.

1097
00:51:35,451 --> 00:51:36,679
Incredible ice cream.

1098
00:51:36,752 --> 00:51:37,946
Hmm.

1099
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:40,420
I'm turning around.

1100
00:51:40,489 --> 00:51:43,424
Hey, remember when
we used to smoke pot

1101
00:51:43,492 --> 00:51:45,551
and eat your ice cream
in the hot tub?

1102
00:51:45,628 --> 00:51:50,861
(GIGGLES) The hot tub?
That feels like
a billion years ago.

Do you have
a heart condition,
Mr. Adler?

No. And I just
had a check-up.

You did? That's good.

Took 'em all.
What all did you take?

Lipitor, baby aspirin.
Flomax.

Flomax?

Yes. Otherwise,
I pee 40 times a day.

How long have you
been taking the Flomax?

1314

Not long.
I only take it sporadically.
I have to sneak it, actually.

1315
01:02:16,658 --> 01:02:21,322
It reduces semen,
which is not good for
my wife right now. Sorry.

Yes. My guess is Flomax

01:02:35,677 --> 01:02:37,736
is probably
the culprit here.

I suggest you stay off
that for a few weeks.

your wife will appreciate.

Back when we broke up...

all your fault.

that to me before.

Because when you cheated,
I didn't have to.

I gave up on us.

you ever really did.

that I'm weird or

01:34:24,150 --> 01:34:26,015
I hate that you're
being so distant.

1884
01:34:26,086 --> 01:34:29,419
It's literally giving me
a pain in my stomach.

No. See? Too much.

1888
01:34:38,298 --> 01:34:39,959
Okay. Good note.

1889
01:34:41,801 --> 01:34:45,259
Uh, can I help you with
what you're doing?

1890
01:34:45,338 --> 01:34:47,806
Maybe hold your basket?

1891
01:34:49,009 --> 01:34:50,306
I'm fine.

1892
01:34:50,410 --> 01:34:51,775
Okay, I'm going to
go to the video store

1893
01:34:51,845 --> 01:34:53,369
and get us a DVD
we can watch tonight.

1894
01:34:53,446 --> 01:34:55,004
Mmm-hmm.
We'll have movie night,
like old times.

1895
01:34:55,115 --> 01:34:57,948
How's that?
I'll make the popcorn.
(SOFTLY) Oh, God!

1896
01:34:58,018 --> 01:34:59,178

Oh, no. I'm just...

Oh, yes.
The Single man party.

1914
01:35:54,541 --> 01:35:55,735
MAN.: It's in
the main ballroom.

1915
01:35:55,809 --> 01:35:57,743
BEN.: Ah, thank you.

in my apartment.

I don't either.

1921
01:36:10,056 --> 01:36:11,114
Why are we still hungry?

1924
01:36:13,927 --> 01:36:14,951
Any leftovers?

1925
01:36:15,028 --> 01:36:16,017
Uh, are you kidding?

1926
01:36:16,096 --> 01:36:18,496
Any of that
noodle thing left?

1927
01:36:19,899 --> 01:36:23,858
Oh! Where's your mom?
She disappeared so fast
after the movie.

1928
01:36:23,937 --> 01:36:25,495
She's probably sleeping.

1929
01:36:25,572 --> 01:36:27,938
I think she's
on her computer.

1930
01:36:28,908 --> 01:36:30,808
Tonight was weird.

1931
01:36:30,877 --> 01:36:32,708
So weird. Still is.

1932
01:36:33,246 --> 01:36:34,304
I loved tonight.

1933
01:36:34,380 --> 01:36:36,109
Yeah. That's why
it's so weird.

1934
01:36:36,182 --> 01:36:38,707
Just to see you in
your robe in our kitchen.

1935
01:36:38,785 --> 01:36:40,184
Remember when you
weren't even allowed in?

1936
01:36:40,253 --> 01:36:42,414
Mom used to go out to
the car to talk to you.

1937
01:36:42,522 --> 01:36:46,618
You know, I don't even
really remember you
and Mom as a couple.

1938
01:36:47,060 --> 01:36:50,029
What do you mean?
You were 10 when
we broke up.

1939
01:36:50,096 --> 01:36:51,927
I was 1 2, actually.

1940
01:36:52,031 --> 01:36:55,694
And I don't know,
it's just...
It's all foggy to me now.

1941
01:36:55,769 --> 01:36:57,737
You don't
remember us in Hawaii

1942
01:36:57,804 --> 01:37:00,102
or all of us sleeping
together in that tent
in the backyard?

1943
01:37:00,206 --> 01:37:03,437
Yeah, of course.
I just...
I don't remember, like,

1944
01:37:03,910 --> 01:37:07,869
you and Mom hugging
or waking up together.

1945
01:37:09,082 --> 01:37:10,208
Luke.

1946
01:37:10,283 --> 01:37:12,148
(CHUCKLES) It's okay.
I'm not damaged or anything.

1947
01:37:12,252 --> 01:37:16,586
Dude, speak for yourself.
I am definitely damaged
from this divorce.

1948
01:37:16,823 --> 01:37:18,120
Hello, troops.

1949
01:37:18,191 --> 01:37:19,453
Why are you still here?

1950
01:37:19,559 --> 01:37:23,051
I don't know.
You and Mom sleeping
in the same house?

1951
01:37:23,596 --> 01:37:25,928
Harley thought
we should stay.

1952
01:37:26,633 --> 01:37:28,464
She exaggerates.
I just thought, perhaps,

1953
01:37:28,535 --> 01:37:30,298
you might want
to talk later or...

1954
01:37:30,403 --> 01:37:31,995
Is that the noodle thing?

1955
01:37:34,440 --> 01:37:37,034
Oh, I'm sorry.
I think I ate it all.

1956
01:37:37,110 --> 01:37:38,236
Dad!

1957
01:37:38,311 --> 01:37:39,642
I didn't know
anyone wanted it.

A little bit back,
so I can see. Oh!

1960
01:37:45,752 --> 01:37:46,810
Very festive.

1961
01:37:46,886 --> 01:37:48,148
Okay, thanks.

1962
01:37:48,488 --> 01:37:50,149
It was gift from
my ex-sister-in-law.

1963
01:37:50,223 --> 01:37:53,192
I have no idea
why I kept it.
Into the pile.

1964
01:37:53,259 --> 01:37:55,318
Hey, Jane,
take a look at the pile.

1965
01:37:55,428 --> 01:37:57,658
Yeah. Nice!

01:37:57,764 --> 01:37:59,629
Ah! The pile's moving.

(LAUGHING)

1969
01:38:03,436 --> 01:38:05,404
When I was in India
I had this made,

1970
01:38:05,471 --> 01:38:06,529
but the guy ran
out of fabric,

1971
01:38:07,006 --> 01:38:09,941
so he didn't give
me long sleeves,
or short sleeves.

1972
01:38:10,009 --> 01:38:11,340
It's weird.

1973
01:38:11,411 --> 01:38:12,673
Uh, and kind of girly.

1974
01:38:13,012 --> 01:38:14,343
Not what I should
be going for.

1975
01:38:15,315 --> 01:38:17,875
How about this?
Gray sweater, very old.

1976
01:38:17,984 --> 01:38:19,611
Oh. But cute.

1977
01:38:19,686 --> 01:38:21,051
You're sure? Now you
don't have to say that

1978
01:38:21,154 --> 01:38:22,815
just because you nixed
the last 20 things.

1979
01:38:22,889 --> 01:38:25,119
No. You have to
keep that. It's cozy.

You are helping me
so much, by the way.

I gotta pee.

What's happening?

Okay. Just let me explain.

2001
01:40:08,761 --> 01:40:11,252
The reason
that I left Agnes
was not just because

2002
01:40:11,331 --> 01:40:13,697
my marriage
wasn't working.

2003

I've also fallen in love...

2004

Back in love
with your mother.

2005
01:40:24,811 --> 01:40:27,780
Maybe, I never
stopped loving her.

2006
01:40:29,482 --> 01:40:31,109
Is this a joke?

2007

I know it's shocking,

but I think this
is the best thing that's
ever happened to me.

2009
01:40:37,991 --> 01:40:41,324
Your mother and I
have been seeing each other
ever since New York.

is this true?

01:40:50,169 --> 01:40:52,330
I hope she'll take me back.

Why is everyone crying?
Why isn't this good news?

isn't all that comforting.

2039
01:44:50,443 --> 01:44:53,105
And I experimented
with a part of myself

2040
01:44:53,212 --> 01:44:55,874
because I wanted to know
if after all these years

2041
01:44:55,948 --> 01:44:59,907
there was still something
there between us.

2042
01:45:00,553 --> 01:45:02,111
And was there?

2043
01:45:02,622 --> 01:45:04,783
Mmm,
there kind of was. Yeah.

2044
01:45:05,424 --> 01:45:07,688
But, Mom,
you have to understand

2045
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:09,990
how bonkers
this sounds to us.

2046
01:45:10,096 --> 01:45:11,085
Mmm.

2047
01:45:11,163 --> 01:45:12,562
For two people,

2048
01:45:12,632 --> 01:45:16,090
who for years couldn't be
in the same room together,

2049
01:45:16,168 --> 01:45:18,159
to then have an affair.

2050
01:45:18,271 --> 01:45:21,434
I know. It was hard
for me and I was doing it.

2051
01:45:22,174 --> 01:45:27,237
I hope you'll forgive me
for confusing you.

2052
01:45:29,015 --> 01:45:31,142
And betraying your trust.

2053
01:45:32,418 --> 01:45:34,852
But, I did this for me.

2054
01:45:35,688 --> 01:45:37,622
And I did it for him.

2055
01:45:38,024 --> 01:45:40,652
And I realize
that even though
your dad and I

2056
01:45:40,726 --> 01:45:44,162
once had
something extraordinary,

2057
01:45:45,197 --> 01:45:49,930
now we no longer really

2058
01:45:51,671 --> 01:45:53,195
fit together.

2059
01:45:56,542 --> 01:45:59,943
But he is a part of me.
He always will be.

2060
01:46:00,379 --> 01:46:04,475
So, it's over now?
You guys are back
to being divorced?

2061
01:46:05,851 --> 01:46:07,182
Mmm-hmm.

2062
01:46:10,456 --> 01:46:12,515
For better or for worse.

2063
01:46:17,897 --> 01:46:19,296
Come here.

2064
01:46:20,466 --> 01:46:21,831
My littlest...

2065
01:46:21,901 --> 01:46:23,732
Okay, I'm coming in.

2066
01:46:24,470 --> 01:46:25,562

2067
01:46:25,671 --> 01:46:27,002

(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

2069
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:36,471
MAN: So, did you
get the elevations?

2070
01:46:36,549 --> 01:46:38,483
ADAM: Yup,
we like them, too.

2071
01:46:39,085 --> 01:46:42,577
Uh-huh. I think
all the problems
are solved now.

2072
01:46:42,688 --> 01:46:45,885
Go forward.
I'll have more
for you by mid-week.

2073
01:46:49,528 --> 01:46:52,588
Uh, can I
call you right back?
Someone just...

2074
01:46:52,698 --> 01:46:54,222
Yeah, thanks.

2075
01:46:56,669 --> 01:46:58,000
Hi.
Hi.

2076
01:46:59,171 --> 01:47:00,195
May I come in?

2077
01:47:00,272 --> 01:47:01,261
Uh, sure.

2078
01:47:05,678 --> 01:47:07,043
(EXHALES)

2079
01:47:10,716 --> 01:47:13,947
I didn't call you last night
because I wasn't sure
you'd take the call.

2080
01:47:14,053 --> 01:47:15,281
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

2081
01:47:15,388 --> 01:47:17,083
And then I thought
that could go on
for months.

2082
01:47:17,189 --> 01:47:19,282
I would've taken the call.

2083
01:47:19,458 --> 01:47:22,621
Oh! Okay. Well...

2084
01:47:23,963 --> 01:47:26,727
Anyway, it's better
to say these things
in person, Adam.

2085
01:47:26,799 --> 01:47:28,630
The man that
I was seeing...

2086
01:47:28,734 --> 01:47:31,430
I think I'm up to
speed on that part.

2087
01:47:32,805 --> 01:47:36,366
Yeah.
Anyway, I want you to know
it didn't last long.

2088
01:47:37,243 --> 01:47:38,972
You're divorced. I mean,

2089
01:47:39,078 --> 01:47:41,376
maybe you can understand
when a marriage ends

2090
01:47:41,447 --> 01:47:45,383
there's doubts and hurt
and when you have kids,
you just...

2091
01:47:45,451 --> 01:47:47,919
Sometimes you wonder
if you did the right thing,

2092
01:47:47,987 --> 01:47:50,387
and the moment
presents itself and...

2093
01:47:50,456 --> 01:47:53,721
I get it. I could
imagine it. I could.

2094
01:47:55,161 --> 01:47:58,494
And I told him
that it wasn't going
to work out between us,

2095
01:47:58,597 --> 01:48:02,431
but I guess he didn't
hear me or believe me.

2096
01:48:04,236 --> 01:48:07,000
And, uh, unbeknownst to me,
he showed up at
my house yesterday

2097
01:48:07,106 --> 01:48:08,630
and he has left Agnes.

2098
01:48:08,741 --> 01:48:12,074
Jane, I actually
think I understand
what happened.

2099
01:48:13,612 --> 01:48:17,742
But, you know, um,
I'm not as macho
as I appear.

2100
01:48:18,117 --> 01:48:22,076
And I think it's
probably best for us

2101
01:48:22,154 --> 01:48:24,122
if we don't get
any more involved.

2102
01:48:25,124 --> 01:48:30,152
Because your
relationship with Jake
isn't really done.

2103
01:48:30,696 --> 01:48:32,220
And I know
you're saying it is,

2104
01:48:32,298 --> 01:48:35,096
but he's still
in love with you.

2105
01:48:36,368 --> 01:48:40,702
And for everyone's sake,
I think that should
probably get resolved.

2106
01:48:44,276 --> 01:48:47,803
Wow. So that's how
grownups talk.

2107
01:48:51,150 --> 01:48:53,550
Please don't tell me that
you're going to quit my job

2108
01:48:53,652 --> 01:48:56,052
and ask Peter
to take over now.

2109
01:48:56,222 --> 01:48:59,214
'Cause then I'll never
get to see you. And...

2110
01:48:59,325 --> 01:49:03,284
Um... I was thinking
of asking Peter
to step back in.

2111
01:49:07,233 --> 01:49:08,996
I hope you don't.

2112
01:49:10,402 --> 01:49:11,699
Thanks.

2113
01:49:23,716 --> 01:49:25,081
(EXHALES)

2114
01:50:12,865 --> 01:50:14,264
I'm sorry.

2115
01:50:19,371 --> 01:50:21,805
How far back
does that sorry go?

2116
01:50:22,241 --> 01:50:24,232
How far back do
you need it to go?

2117
01:50:24,310 --> 01:50:25,777
Way back.

2118
01:50:27,279 --> 01:50:30,043
Consider it an all
inclusive apology.

2119
01:50:30,716 --> 01:50:35,744
From not being
the husband you needed

2120
01:50:36,956 --> 01:50:39,754
to showing up nude on
your bed last night.

2121
01:50:39,825 --> 01:50:41,053
Yeah.

2122
01:50:42,995 --> 01:50:46,761
(CHUCKLES) What were you
thinking with that move?

2123
01:50:47,666 --> 01:50:49,998
That you would
find me irresistible.

2124
01:50:50,102 --> 01:50:51,126
Mmm-hmm.

2125
01:50:51,203 --> 01:50:53,501
I never considered
the alternative.

2126
01:50:53,606 --> 01:50:55,801
Got to love that
about you.

2127
01:50:56,609 --> 01:50:57,906
Oh, man.

2128
01:50:59,445 --> 01:51:03,814
I can't believe
I got up to bat again
and blew it.

2129
01:51:04,183 --> 01:51:06,014
You didn't blow it.

We blew it
the first time around.

2133
01:51:13,859 --> 01:51:16,828
This time we just
should've known better.

2134
01:51:18,130 --> 01:51:22,499
Too much time has passed.
Too much has happened.

2135
01:51:24,470 --> 01:51:27,462
And you don't think
we could make it right?

2136
01:51:29,308 --> 01:51:32,971
Does that mean
you thought it didn't
feel right either?

2137
01:51:33,545 --> 01:51:37,174
Being with you, Jane,
is the best I'm going to be.

2138
01:51:37,549 --> 01:51:39,983
But do you agree it...

2139
01:51:40,953 --> 01:51:41,977
It wasn't really...

2140
01:51:42,054 --> 01:51:43,851
It was complicated.

2141
01:51:44,890 --> 01:51:46,221
Begging for an answer.

2142
01:51:46,325 --> 01:51:48,293
I thought it was good.

01:51:49,128 --> 01:51:51,119
I wanted it to be good.

2144
01:51:52,331 --> 01:51:55,061
Well, it's as close
as I'm going to get,
I guess.
