and children, and...

00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:43,191
He, um-
He became my friend.

676
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:47,863
And, uh, we played lots
of cricket together, and-

677
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:52,873
Well, we played everything together, and-and
it stayed like that for a few years.

And then, um-

679
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,123
And then one night, it, uh-

680

it became something else.

We had a few months together.
We had that.

682

And, um- And then there was
a weekend in Udaipur...

where... we were sitting by a lake
and watching the sun go down.

Because, suddenly,
it was over.

We'd fallen asleep,
and they found us.

00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:36,165
Well, it was bad enough
for me.

But I knew who I was, and I
think my family guessed.

Yes, I see that.

I'm Princess Margaret.

It is most certainly
an honor to meet you, madam.

for by the hotel and look how that went.

I'd rather

And for myself,
the news is even better.

1467
01:38:00,333 --> 01:38:02,461
I shall be moving to Delhi
to live with my mother.

And, furthermore, I shall be wed to a
most suitable person of her choice,

1469
01:38:05,671 --> 01:38:09,016
whom I look forward very much to meeting
before I spend the rest of my life with her.

1470
01:38:10,510 --> 01:38:14,140
Didn't you have a girlfriend?
She is my girlfriend no longer.

1471

This is a disaster.

1472

No, no. Then we must treat it just the
same as we would treat a triumph, madam.

Is that not what
your Mr. Kipling tells us?

1474
01:38:23,648 --> 01:38:25,616
Although, of course,
here we have a problem,

1475
01:38:25,691 --> 01:38:29,491
because I, Sunil lndrajit Kapoor,
have never had a triumph.

So, of course,
I do not know how to treat one.

Most deeply.
Have you told her you love her?

1481
01:38:44,669 --> 01:38:47,889
It is because I love her
that I must not tell her.

1482
01:38:47,964 --> 01:38:50,262
She can do so much better
than me, madam.

1483
01:38:50,341 --> 01:38:53,265
Women love it when you say that kind of thing.
It's a powerful aphrodisiac.

1484
01:38:53,386 --> 01:38:56,139
Really?
No, of course not.

1485

Go and ind her at once, before she starts
to believe you and you lose her forever.

You can have
anything you want, Sonny.

1487
01:39:02,728 --> 01:39:05,652
You just need to stop waiting for
someone to tell you you deserve it.

It is too soon.

01:52:59,064 --> 01:53:03,194
And the measure of success is
how we cope with disappoinment.

1692
01:53:04,820 --> 01:53:06,697
As we always must

1693
01:53:10,826 --> 01:53:14,046
We came here and we fried

1694
01:53:14,121 --> 01:53:16,965
All of us in our different ways.

1695
01:53:21,169 --> 01:53:25,345
Can we be blamed for feeling
that we are too old to change?

1696
01:53:28,719 --> 01:53:32,019
Too scared of disappoinment
to start it all again ?

1697
01:53:36,351 --> 01:53:38,445
We get up in the morning.

1698
01:53:39,563 --> 01:53:41,657
We do our best

1699
01:53:44,026 --> 01:53:46,120
Nothing else matters.

1700
01:54:13,180 --> 01:54:16,400
You're still here.
I-I-I missed the plane.

1701
01:54:17,684 --> 01:54:20,938
What about Jean?
She didn't.

1702
01:54:23,857 --> 01:54:27,111
I had- I had quite an
interesting night actually.

1703
01:54:27,194 --> 01:54:29,868
I-I met the same, um,
taxi driver,

1704
01:54:29,946 --> 01:54:33,075
but this time I let him take
me to his brother's hotel.

1705
01:54:33,158 --> 01:54:36,662
Wh-Which turned out to be less
of a hotel and more of a-

1706
01:54:38,038 --> 01:54:41,167
more of a brothel really.

1707
01:54:41,249 --> 01:54:44,879
And they- And they gave me this
pipe, said it was apple tobacco.

1708
01:54:44,961 --> 01:54:48,886
But that's not what they called
it when I was a student.

1709
01:54:48,965 --> 01:54:51,889
So-So I made my excuses
and left.

1710
01:54:51,968 --> 01:54:55,598
Uh, I need-
I needed time to... think.

1711
01:54:58,809 --> 01:55:02,484
This city at night
is extraordinary.

1712
01:55:04,689 --> 01:55:07,943
I think the apple tobacco
helped probably.

1713
01:55:08,068 --> 01:55:10,617
I'm going to be late for work.
Right.

1714
01:55:12,781 --> 01:55:14,328
Um-

1715
01:55:15,575 --> 01:55:19,125
What time do you finish?
I get back about 5:00.

1716
01:55:20,497 --> 01:55:22,591
Teatime.
Yes.

1717
01:55:22,707 --> 01:55:26,678
How do you take it?
With a little milk.

1718
01:55:26,753 --> 01:55:28,426
All right.

[ Evelyn Narrating ] But it's also true
that the person who nsks nothing...

1721
01:55:53,488 --> 01:55:57,368
does nothing, has nothing.

1722
01:56:01,204 --> 01:56:05,550
All we know about the future
is that it will be different

1723
01:56:05,625 --> 01:56:07,753
Just your signature, please.

1724
01:56:10,714 --> 01:56:13,308
Thank you. Enjoy your stay.

1725
01:56:14,009 --> 01:56:16,683
Welcome. Please.

1726
01:56:19,055 --> 01:56:21,854
This is a building
of the utmost character.

1727
01:56:21,933 --> 01:56:26,689
[ Evelyn Narrating ] But perhaps what
we fear is that it will be the same.

1728
01:56:30,066 --> 01:56:32,910
So we must celebrate
the changes.

1729
01:56:32,986 --> 01:56:34,533
Thank you.

1730

Because, as someone once said,
everything will be all nfght in the end.

1731
01:56:41,786 --> 01:56:46,462
And if it's nott all right,
then trust me-

1732
01:56:49,377 --> 01:56:51,596
It's not yet the end
