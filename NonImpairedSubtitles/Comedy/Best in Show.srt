1
00:00:43,956 --> 00:00:46,982
I imagine the bestplace to start
is at the beginning.

2
00:00:49,027 --> 00:00:50,153
Meg.

3
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:52,421
Why are you here?

4
00:00:53,498 --> 00:00:55,557
Beatrice has...

5
00:00:58,036 --> 00:01:01,267
...been showing signs of depression.

6
00:01:02,007 --> 00:01:04,498
She's also been very, very angry
with us.

7
00:01:05,243 --> 00:01:07,939
Ever since she saw us having sex.

8
00:01:13,151 --> 00:01:17,315
When you were having sex, was it
different or unusual in any way?

9
00:01:21,259 --> 00:01:25,025
We got a book. Kama Sutra.

10
00:01:26,498 --> 00:01:28,159
I lit some candles...

11
00:01:29,201 --> 00:01:30,498
...and played some music.

12
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,534
And got myself in a position
that wasn't...

13
00:01:35,674 --> 00:01:38,609
...very easy for me, emotionally.

14
00:01:39,244 --> 00:01:41,303
It's called the Congress of the Cow...

15
00:01:42,514 --> 00:01:43,640
...where...

16
00:01:43,849 --> 00:01:48,013
...the woman is bent over, the hands
are on the floor, the man is behind.

17
00:01:49,488 --> 00:01:51,820
What did she do when she saw you?

18
00:01:52,024 --> 00:01:54,254
She just stood there staring at us.

19
00:01:54,459 --> 00:01:57,519
-She didn't say anything?
-Didn't say a word.

20
00:01:58,797 --> 00:02:01,493
What would you like to say
to Beatrice right now?

21
00:02:05,804 --> 00:02:09,171
I'm sorry. I'm sorry you had
to see that.

22
00:02:09,374 --> 00:02:10,966
Beatrice, can you look at us?

23
00:02:11,877 --> 00:02:14,505
Come on, honey, Mommy and Daddy
are over here.

24
00:02:17,349 --> 00:02:18,577
Champions into the ring.

25
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:23,312
Thank you. Right on around.

26
00:02:25,924 --> 00:02:28,324
Just trot him straight away
and back, please.

27
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:32,528
They couldn't have ordered up a
nicer day, I'll say that for them.

28
00:02:32,731 --> 00:02:35,063
I woke up, I was so glad.

29
00:02:35,634 --> 00:02:37,864
Would everybody please
fill in to line?

30
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,937
Leads up. Let's take them all around.

31
00:02:45,944 --> 00:02:49,243
Best of Breed. Best of Winners.
Best Opposite.

32
00:02:49,448 --> 00:02:50,881
Yes!

33
00:02:52,484 --> 00:02:53,746
Super.

34
00:02:54,086 --> 00:02:57,578
I like to think that Cookie and I
work as a team.

35
00:02:57,789 --> 00:02:59,051
Although I do nothing.

36
00:02:59,257 --> 00:03:02,090
She does all the work with Winky.

37
00:03:04,029 --> 00:03:07,396
Well, the fiirst time we met
was at this...

38
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,067
...big dance.

39
00:03:10,902 --> 00:03:14,303
And I just thought she was the
prettiest thing...

40
00:03:14,506 --> 00:03:15,905
...that I'd ever seen.

41
00:03:16,108 --> 00:03:18,599
And she was there with somebody else.

42
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:22,803
She was very popular back then.
She had dozens of boyfriends.

43
00:03:23,148 --> 00:03:24,479
Hundreds.

44
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,615
Hundreds?

45
00:03:26,885 --> 00:03:27,977
Yeah, hundreds.

46
00:03:28,186 --> 00:03:30,086
I did not know that!

47
00:03:31,356 --> 00:03:32,584
Hundreds.

48
00:03:33,892 --> 00:03:36,759
Well, not that I didn't have
a reputation myself...

49
00:03:36,962 --> 00:03:40,864
...because, you know,
I was considered...

50
00:03:41,066 --> 00:03:45,901
...by "some" to be quite
the Casanova, myself.

51
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:50,638
Back at Ponce de Leon Junior High.
But we started dancing....

52
00:03:50,976 --> 00:03:52,841
He didn't want to dance!

53
00:03:53,044 --> 00:03:56,036
-I didn't want to dance because--
-I said, "Get up, Gerry."

54
00:03:56,248 --> 00:03:58,307
I kept saying, "No, I can't dance.

55
00:03:58,517 --> 00:04:01,350
I've got two left feet!
I've got two left feet!"

56
00:04:01,553 --> 00:04:03,248
I thought he was kidding.

57
00:04:04,022 --> 00:04:05,387
But I wasn't.

58
00:04:06,858 --> 00:04:08,951
I was born...

59
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:11,922
...with two left feet.

60
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:14,826
And they had a nickname for me.

61
00:04:15,033 --> 00:04:16,591
They used to call me Loopy...

62
00:04:16,802 --> 00:04:19,862
...because, you know,
I would walk in little loops.

63
00:04:20,071 --> 00:04:21,868
I kept going in circles.

64
00:04:22,574 --> 00:04:25,600
And then with some therapy
I learned...

65
00:04:26,278 --> 00:04:27,870
...how to walk a straight line.

66
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:29,512
And dance.

67
00:04:29,714 --> 00:04:31,511
-And dance!
-And dance.

68
00:04:31,716 --> 00:04:34,947
Oh, man, you got moves better
than Winky, I think.

69
00:04:36,488 --> 00:04:40,356
My great-grandfather Millbank,
in 1875...

70
00:04:40,559 --> 00:04:44,290
...began the Mayflower IKennel Club
and Dog Show.

71
00:04:44,496 --> 00:04:45,554
It started small.

72
00:04:47,799 --> 00:04:49,892
He operated out of this
house we're in...

73
00:04:50,101 --> 00:04:53,537
...this beautiful building,
and this lovely room...

74
00:04:53,738 --> 00:04:57,538
...which grew and grew, and of course,
nobody lives here anymore.

75
00:04:57,742 --> 00:04:59,334
But, it's our...

76
00:04:59,845 --> 00:05:01,335
...it's our place.

77
00:05:01,546 --> 00:05:05,573
And then my grandfather continued
the tradition...

78
00:05:05,784 --> 00:05:09,481
...and really, I think what we're
talking about is standards...

79
00:05:09,688 --> 00:05:13,647
...very, very specific, rigid,
you could say...

80
00:05:13,859 --> 00:05:16,020
...but in this world...

81
00:05:16,228 --> 00:05:19,026
...where would we be without them,
I think.

82
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,926
And notice where we are.

83
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,830
We've got some real standards...

84
00:05:24,035 --> 00:05:27,300
...and in Jessica's case,
we have a bite standard...

85
00:05:27,505 --> 00:05:30,736
...but we don't have
a number of teeth standard.

86
00:05:30,942 --> 00:05:34,002
The breeds do differ in that,
but they're very strict...

87
00:05:34,212 --> 00:05:36,976
...and they're very, very pure.

88
00:05:37,182 --> 00:05:38,376
And, that.... Oh, yes?

89
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,847
Did you hear that?
Did you hear what I said?

90
00:05:41,052 --> 00:05:43,077
I think she--
I think you heard what I said.

91
00:05:43,288 --> 00:05:44,778
You were listening to me.

92
00:05:49,327 --> 00:05:51,522
Now, when somebody comes in here...

93
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:54,790
...your average tourist,
fisherperson, right?

94
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,400
They want to know, "Where do I go?"

95
00:05:57,602 --> 00:06:00,070
What you do is sell them this map...

96
00:06:00,272 --> 00:06:02,001
...and all these different flies.

97
00:06:02,207 --> 00:06:04,767
You take the map.
You take your best places...

98
00:06:04,976 --> 00:06:08,537
...and you take the best fly for
the place, put it right on the map.

99
00:06:08,747 --> 00:06:11,773
Then you'd sell them the map.
Now they know where to go.

100
00:06:11,983 --> 00:06:13,473
We pick out the pattern for you.

101
00:06:13,685 --> 00:06:16,950
It could be a Disco Midge,
it could be a Beadhead...

102
00:06:17,155 --> 00:06:19,555
...it could be a Parachute Adams,
whatever it is.

103
00:06:19,758 --> 00:06:21,385
He doesn't have to think, "Oh."

104
00:06:21,593 --> 00:06:23,288
Aside from fishing...

105
00:06:23,495 --> 00:06:26,794
...dogs have always been a big thing
in my family.

106
00:06:26,998 --> 00:06:30,525
My father was a Coonhound man.

107
00:06:30,735 --> 00:06:32,532
He had Red Bones...

108
00:06:32,737 --> 00:06:35,672
...and his brother had a Blue Tick,
and his brother had a Plott Hound...

109
00:06:35,874 --> 00:06:38,206
...and some other
members of the family...

110
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:42,506
...they had Steven's stock
and some Cataloona Hounds.

111
00:06:42,714 --> 00:06:46,275
And my brother Otto also had
a Red Bone.

112
00:06:46,484 --> 00:06:49,078
We'd fight all the time.
He'd say, "I'm a Red Bone man!"

113
00:06:49,287 --> 00:06:51,482
I used to say, "I'm a Bloodhound man!"

114
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:56,957
The Bloodhound, of all the breeds, is
just such a noble, loyal, perfect dog.

115
00:06:57,162 --> 00:06:58,686
You can't find a better dog...

116
00:06:58,897 --> 00:07:00,364
...on the whole planet Earth.

117
00:07:00,565 --> 00:07:02,965
And I would guess that even
if one day...

118
00:07:03,168 --> 00:07:06,626
...they land on some other planet
in Venus or Mars, whatever...

119
00:07:06,838 --> 00:07:08,863
...you couldn't find a better dog.

120
00:07:09,207 --> 00:07:12,108
And Hubert is the best Hound
I've ever had.

121
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:15,040
I've had probably 10 or 1 5.

122
00:07:15,246 --> 00:07:20,240
He is not only a great show dog,
but he could be a great man-trail dog.

123
00:07:20,452 --> 00:07:23,387
If the police came and said,
"I need a great Bloodhound"...

124
00:07:23,588 --> 00:07:26,250
...he would be the one to take out.

125
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:30,292
Because if there was some kind of
convict loose, God forbid...

126
00:07:30,495 --> 00:07:32,326
...he would be the one to find him.

127
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,494
We got all fresh cuts today,
top-loin...

128
00:07:38,703 --> 00:07:41,729
...porterhouse, T-bone, blade,
ball-tip, tri-tip, chuck.

129
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,239
-We got everything.
-So, basically, you know, meat.

130
00:07:45,844 --> 00:07:47,141
-Got a lot of meat.
-Oh, good.

131
00:07:47,345 --> 00:07:48,539
Now, Tyrone...

132
00:07:48,747 --> 00:07:51,113
...liked those kidneys.
How about a half-pound?

133
00:07:51,316 --> 00:07:54,410
Not the kidneys.
I don't want to pull the membranes.

134
00:07:54,619 --> 00:07:56,644
I'll take care of the membranes.

135
00:07:56,855 --> 00:07:58,755
-You could pull it off.
-Stop it.

136
00:07:59,524 --> 00:08:03,585
A half-pound of the salmon,
half-pound of the kidneys.

137
00:08:03,795 --> 00:08:06,855
Do me a favor. Just get one of
those pepperoni sticks out.

138
00:08:07,065 --> 00:08:10,398
-I just want to hold it.
-Will you stop it? You are so bad.

139
00:08:10,602 --> 00:08:13,594
I had been a hairdresser
about 14 years...

140
00:08:13,905 --> 00:08:17,898
...and I went to a show,
and I saw his nibs here...

141
00:08:18,109 --> 00:08:20,373
...having his way with a Borzoi.

142
00:08:20,578 --> 00:08:24,378
Just trotting around that ring like he
was born to it, and he was.

143
00:08:24,582 --> 00:08:28,518
I asked my ex-wife, I said, "Who's
that?" She says, "That's Scott.

144
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,948
He shows a good dog."

145
00:08:30,155 --> 00:08:32,680
I've never seen anyone as light
on his feet--

146
00:08:32,891 --> 00:08:35,621
-Light in the loafers. Say it.
-No, no, no!

147
00:08:35,827 --> 00:08:37,522
-Stop. No.
-Wait until I tell Mom!

148
00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:42,098
It's just he and the Borzoi seemed to
have the same prance, the same....

149
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:46,031
It was like they were two members
of the same body, you might say.

150
00:08:46,237 --> 00:08:47,534
And it was a wonderful thing.

151
00:08:47,739 --> 00:08:50,867
I knew a guy who had two members
on the same body.

152
00:08:51,076 --> 00:08:52,907
-I dated him.
-In your dreams.

153
00:08:53,111 --> 00:08:56,740
Got so exhausted.... Go on.
I'm sorry. You were telling a story.

154
00:08:56,948 --> 00:08:59,746
No, and I asked Deb, I said,
"Who's that?" She said:

155
00:08:59,951 --> 00:09:03,443
"That's Scott, and he cuts hair,
he grooms dogs...

156
00:09:03,655 --> 00:09:06,089
...and he shows dogs,
and he's a genius."

157
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:10,591
-Then I was, like, wild man on campus.
-Club scene. Mr. Club Scene here.

158
00:09:10,795 --> 00:09:14,731
On Friday night, I'd have 3 Saturday
nights, then go home and wake up.

159
00:09:14,933 --> 00:09:18,630
My, God, what a thrill.
Don't knock it till you've tried it.

160
00:09:18,837 --> 00:09:22,773
Anyway, so we get together,
we see several movies...

161
00:09:22,974 --> 00:09:25,306
-...we like the same stuff.
-Before you know it....

162
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:27,944
-It's the all-American love story.
-It sure is.

163
00:09:28,146 --> 00:09:29,773
Writ large.

164
00:09:30,181 --> 00:09:33,446
On the marquee, big letters: "Us."

165
00:09:36,387 --> 00:09:38,582
We've been together
fiive years.

166
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:42,883
We have an amazing relationship,
and it's very physical.

167
00:09:43,094 --> 00:09:46,461
I mean, he still pushes
all my buttons.

168
00:09:46,664 --> 00:09:50,327
And you know, people say, "Oh, but
he's so much older than you."

169
00:09:50,535 --> 00:09:54,801
And you know what? I'm the one having
to push him away.

170
00:09:55,673 --> 00:09:57,971
Yeah, we both have so much in common.

171
00:09:58,343 --> 00:10:00,243
We both love soup.

172
00:10:00,445 --> 00:10:04,381
And we love the outdoors.

173
00:10:04,582 --> 00:10:07,312
We love snow peas.

174
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,783
And...

175
00:10:10,421 --> 00:10:13,322
...talking and not talking.

176
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:21,956
We could not talk or talk forever...

177
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,133
...and still find things to not
talk about.

178
00:10:30,175 --> 00:10:31,699
Hi. I'm Graham Chissolm.

179
00:10:33,978 --> 00:10:35,343
I'm the show chairman.

180
00:10:35,547 --> 00:10:37,572
This is a very special time for me.

181
00:10:37,782 --> 00:10:40,717
It's something I do every year
before the show...

182
00:10:41,219 --> 00:10:46,156
...is come here and kind of, for the
last time, enjoy the solitude...

183
00:10:46,691 --> 00:10:50,388
...of what I call a blank canvas.
And...

184
00:10:50,595 --> 00:10:53,826
...there it is right there.
There's nothing out there.

185
00:10:54,232 --> 00:10:57,599
Not that I can see, anyway.
No one here.

186
00:10:57,802 --> 00:11:02,296
In five days from now, you are
not gonna believe the difference.

187
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,903
This center will be packed
with people.

188
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:08,943
And the roar of the crowd,
the energy...

189
00:11:09,147 --> 00:11:11,581
...that this building will exude
will be phenomenal...

190
00:11:11,783 --> 00:11:14,513
...with winners and losers.
Although no one loses.

191
00:11:14,719 --> 00:11:18,052
We don't like to say that.
But some have a long drive home.

192
00:11:18,256 --> 00:11:21,589
There are sad eyes on some dogs
that worked hard to get here.

193
00:11:24,662 --> 00:11:25,754
Hamilton?

194
00:11:26,097 --> 00:11:28,861
-We gotta call Dr. Nelken.
-Why?

195
00:11:29,367 --> 00:11:31,096
Beatrice made a pee-pee
on the sheets...

196
00:11:31,302 --> 00:11:33,099
...and a poopie in your slipper.

197
00:11:33,304 --> 00:11:35,033
-In my Orvis slippers?
-I don't know.

198
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,837
-God.
-You been talking to her?

199
00:11:38,042 --> 00:11:40,840
-Of course I have.
-What have you been saying?

200
00:11:41,045 --> 00:11:43,513
I've been saying that when
we make love...

201
00:11:43,715 --> 00:11:45,205
...it's a beautiful thing.

202
00:11:46,017 --> 00:11:47,575
Sometimes.

203
00:11:48,119 --> 00:11:50,417
-Excuse me?
-We met at Starbucks.

204
00:11:50,622 --> 00:11:52,817
Not at the same Starbucks.
We saw each other...

205
00:11:53,024 --> 00:11:56,790
...at different Starbucks across
the street from each other...

206
00:11:58,296 --> 00:12:02,790
...and Hamilton got up the courage
to walk across the street one day...

207
00:12:03,001 --> 00:12:05,595
...and approached me.

208
00:12:05,803 --> 00:12:09,204
Yeah. I'd seen you at law school
before.

209
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,870
And I know that sometimes I'd be
in one Starbucks...

210
00:12:13,077 --> 00:12:16,274
...you'd be in the other Starbucks,
and then I'd think...

211
00:12:16,481 --> 00:12:18,472
...l should go over to that
Starbucks next.

212
00:12:18,683 --> 00:12:22,278
And then you'd be at the other
Starbucks. So we kind of crossed....

213
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,653
-I know. It sounds so stupid now.
-He's so good.

214
00:12:25,857 --> 00:12:29,190
I remember I was drinking
a grande espresso when I met you.

215
00:12:29,394 --> 00:12:31,988
That's right, and I thought that was
really sexy.

216
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,757
-I was drinking cappuccinos.
-I remember.

217
00:12:34,966 --> 00:12:38,834
Then I went to lattes, and then
now, double espressos macchiato.

218
00:12:39,037 --> 00:12:43,064
And I'm now a big old, you know,
Chai-tea-latte, soy milk kind of guy.

219
00:12:43,274 --> 00:12:45,469
-Soy. Yeah.
-Because of the lactose.

220
00:12:45,677 --> 00:12:47,702
You're lactose intolerant now.

221
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:51,248
And I walked across the street,
and there you were....

222
00:12:51,449 --> 00:12:53,178
Working on my Mac.

223
00:12:53,384 --> 00:12:55,318
-And I had my Mac.
-Your Mac.

224
00:12:55,553 --> 00:13:00,490
And there, and then, I look over
and she's reading J. Crew.

225
00:13:00,725 --> 00:13:05,321
That's so weird, as I was such a huge
J. Crew person then too. Still am.

226
00:13:06,397 --> 00:13:09,662
We sometimes like to just go to
Starbucks on weekends and...

227
00:13:09,867 --> 00:13:11,232
...take an L.L. Bean catalog.

228
00:13:11,436 --> 00:13:12,960
I'll say, "Honey, what's new?"

229
00:13:13,171 --> 00:13:15,833
She has five minutes to look
and find what's new.

230
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,769
They've been around forever.

231
00:13:17,975 --> 00:13:22,105
We were so lucky to have been raised
amongst catalogs.

232
00:13:22,313 --> 00:13:23,746
Oh, it's so much easier.

233
00:13:23,948 --> 00:13:26,439
You don't have
to deal with people as much.

234
00:13:26,651 --> 00:13:28,676
You can just talk to the person
on the phone.

235
00:13:28,886 --> 00:13:30,217
-Or not.
-Yeah.

236
00:13:31,522 --> 00:13:35,856
I like to take Hubert for a walk
in the woods before...

237
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,119
...l show him, because...

238
00:13:38,329 --> 00:13:41,594
...it's a more natural kind of
environment for him...

239
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:43,699
...and it makes him relax,
and it makes me...

240
00:13:44,268 --> 00:13:47,396
...relax too, to not think about
the competition.

241
00:13:47,605 --> 00:13:50,335
Just take a walk and, you know...

242
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:53,908
...smell the ground and all that,
and....

243
00:13:54,112 --> 00:13:56,307
What'd you smell? What'd you smell?

244
00:13:56,514 --> 00:14:00,006
See, a lot of times, what he's doing
is, he's--

245
00:14:00,451 --> 00:14:03,386
A Bloodhound not only has a great
nose, but he also--

246
00:14:03,588 --> 00:14:06,216
They can talk. So, what he's
doing, he's talking.

247
00:14:06,424 --> 00:14:08,392
He's saying, "What'd you talk?"

248
00:14:08,593 --> 00:14:10,686
What'd you talk? What'd you talk?

249
00:14:10,895 --> 00:14:13,762
He's saying, "I'm ready."
That's when he's ready for a show.

250
00:14:13,965 --> 00:14:16,798
Because he says, "I'm ready.
I'm ready."

251
00:14:17,001 --> 00:14:20,368
Then I know he's ready.
What is it, boy?

252
00:14:20,571 --> 00:14:23,836
He says, "I'm ready. I've walked
and I'm ready."

253
00:14:24,075 --> 00:14:26,270
Have a good night's sleep, and then...

254
00:14:26,744 --> 00:14:29,713
...we'll get going and it'll be
showtime for you, right?

255
00:14:29,914 --> 00:14:32,883
Now, look at that. The judge will
look at him and say....

256
00:14:37,388 --> 00:14:39,788
Sometimes I think he'll talk to
the judge and say:

257
00:14:39,991 --> 00:14:43,688
"Hey, judge! Hey, judge!
Look at me!"

258
00:14:43,895 --> 00:14:46,420
I mean, the dog isn't going to talk.

259
00:14:46,631 --> 00:14:49,361
But his mind is like a telepathy...

260
00:14:50,234 --> 00:14:51,633
...thing where he says:

261
00:14:51,836 --> 00:14:56,296
"I'm the best one here. I'm the
best one you've ever seen."

262
00:14:56,808 --> 00:14:59,436
The judge, in his mind,
because he can pick up...

263
00:14:59,644 --> 00:15:01,544
...on the telepathy, will...

264
00:15:02,013 --> 00:15:03,981
...sometimes give him...

265
00:15:04,949 --> 00:15:06,348
...the blue ribbon.

266
00:15:06,551 --> 00:15:10,681
"Hey, judge! What's going on
in there?

267
00:15:10,955 --> 00:15:12,820
I know what you're thinking.

268
00:15:13,024 --> 00:15:17,222
And I'm the best dog
in the whole ring!" See?

269
00:15:17,428 --> 00:15:20,090
That's not a bad idea.
Maybe I just should...

270
00:15:20,298 --> 00:15:23,631
...do that. Practice that,
right? Hubert.

271
00:15:24,702 --> 00:15:26,727
-Congratulations!
-The big show.

272
00:15:26,938 --> 00:15:28,872
-You gotta be happy.
-The big show.

273
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,901
What'll you do in Philly?

274
00:15:31,108 --> 00:15:32,700
-What will you see?
-Everything.

275
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,639
We'll see the Liberty Bell...

276
00:15:34,846 --> 00:15:37,246
...the place where
they make the cream cheese....

277
00:15:37,448 --> 00:15:39,313
Oh, honey! Honey.

278
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,277
They're going to Philly to see...

279
00:15:41,486 --> 00:15:43,386
...where they make
the cream cheese...

280
00:15:43,588 --> 00:15:45,317
...we've been talking about!

281
00:15:45,523 --> 00:15:48,048
I want to see where they make
the light cream cheese.

282
00:15:48,259 --> 00:15:50,693
I don't want to go to
that other building.

283
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:54,560
Yes, that factory is not made out
of brick, I don't think.

284
00:15:56,234 --> 00:15:59,397
-We'll cross our fingers for you.
-Fingers crossed.

285
00:16:00,571 --> 00:16:04,098
We'll stop to see friends in Akron.
I told you about the Bermans.

286
00:16:04,575 --> 00:16:07,066
We'll stop there.
We can stay with them.

287
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:09,178
You've talked about him before.

288
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,540
They're dear friends.

289
00:16:10,748 --> 00:16:13,945
My wife wants to drive 140 miles
out of our way...

290
00:16:14,151 --> 00:16:16,585
...to see some people we saw
three years ago.

291
00:16:20,591 --> 00:16:21,956
Anyway.

292
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,392
Oh, someone's still a little jealous.

293
00:16:25,596 --> 00:16:27,029
Oh, jealous?

294
00:16:27,231 --> 00:16:29,825
How many years ago did he poke me?

295
00:16:30,034 --> 00:16:31,433
How many years ago was that?

296
00:16:31,636 --> 00:16:35,003
You've met my wife the comedian.
She thinks I'm jealous.

297
00:16:35,506 --> 00:16:37,201
I'm sure it's all over with.

298
00:16:37,508 --> 00:16:41,000
-Come on. Look how sweet.
-Now see, that's why it works.

299
00:16:41,212 --> 00:16:45,478
God loves a Terrier

300
00:16:45,683 --> 00:16:47,241
Yes, he does

301
00:16:47,451 --> 00:16:51,683
God loves a Terrier

302
00:16:51,889 --> 00:16:53,186
That's because

303
00:16:53,391 --> 00:16:56,121
Small, sturdy, bright and true

304
00:16:56,327 --> 00:16:58,887
They give their love to you

305
00:16:59,096 --> 00:17:01,189
God didn't miss a stitch

306
00:17:01,766 --> 00:17:03,631
Be a dog or be a bitch

307
00:17:03,834 --> 00:17:06,268
When he made the Norwich merrier

308
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:09,166
With his cute little derriere

309
00:17:09,373 --> 00:17:13,673
Yes, God loves a Terrier

310
00:17:17,882 --> 00:17:21,283
What is this? What is this ball?
What is this ball?

311
00:17:21,485 --> 00:17:23,112
Is this your ball? ls this your ball?

312
00:17:23,321 --> 00:17:27,087
We have a wonderful working
relationship.

313
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:29,418
And l...

314
00:17:29,627 --> 00:17:32,425
...have to say I wanted the best
handler...

315
00:17:32,697 --> 00:17:33,891
...and I get what I want.

316
00:17:34,098 --> 00:17:35,156
You sure did.

317
00:17:37,001 --> 00:17:40,095
This kennel that I opened up
was really just a kennel...

318
00:17:40,304 --> 00:17:42,829
...until Sherri Ann and Leslie
showed up...

319
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,476
...and their generosity has turned
this humble little kennel--

320
00:17:46,677 --> 00:17:49,544
-It was a shit box.
-Well, yeah.

321
00:17:50,481 --> 00:17:54,645
They have turned this place into
a cutting-edge, state-of-the-art...

322
00:17:55,219 --> 00:17:59,986
...kennel facility and I'm just so
grateful to them. It's just fantastic.

323
00:18:03,761 --> 00:18:07,356
With Sherri Ann, we have this fantastic
friendship too. It's really great.

324
00:18:07,565 --> 00:18:10,363
We have a little bit of a family
dynamic going here...

325
00:18:10,568 --> 00:18:12,866
...and it mirrors what I grew up with.

326
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:17,439
My father was the taskmaster...

327
00:18:17,642 --> 00:18:20,770
...the disciplinarian, which is what
I do, I'm the mommy/daddy.

328
00:18:20,978 --> 00:18:22,809
Like, Mr. Punishment.

329
00:18:23,014 --> 00:18:24,948
Well, you know, I also reward.

330
00:18:25,149 --> 00:18:27,982
But Sherri is responsible for the
unconditional love....

331
00:18:28,185 --> 00:18:30,619
And the decorative abilities.

332
00:18:30,821 --> 00:18:33,688
The heart and soul,
which is what my mother did.

333
00:18:33,891 --> 00:18:37,019
That was her job. She was
there for unconditional love.

334
00:18:37,228 --> 00:18:38,991
And it worked for my family...

335
00:18:39,196 --> 00:18:41,664
...until my mom committed suicide
in '81 .

336
00:18:43,634 --> 00:18:46,159
Here, let me help you out.
Let me help you.

337
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:47,496
I got it, I got it.

338
00:18:47,705 --> 00:18:51,038
Come on, slow down, you got a long
trip ahead of you, boy.

339
00:18:51,242 --> 00:18:52,834
Okay, for Winky's poopies,
just in case.

340
00:18:53,044 --> 00:18:54,841
-You're so thoughtful.
-Love you.

341
00:18:55,046 --> 00:18:56,274
-Thank you.
-We love you.

342
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,004
And thanks for checking in
on the house.

343
00:18:58,315 --> 00:19:02,843
Sherman's War Trail in Atlanta, get
a ham sandwich at Lee's Comeuppance.

344
00:19:03,054 --> 00:19:06,023
Make sure you stop there and get
a ham sandwich.

345
00:19:07,525 --> 00:19:09,493
Jack, the keys.

346
00:19:09,694 --> 00:19:11,855
-Front door--
-We know how to get in.

347
00:19:12,063 --> 00:19:13,997
-Have a good one.
-Have a great time.

348
00:19:14,198 --> 00:19:16,063
Bring home the blue ribbon!

349
00:19:16,267 --> 00:19:18,701
Don't water the plants,
they're plastic.

350
00:19:20,004 --> 00:19:21,528
Bring home the blue ribbon.

351
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,174
We'll have drinks when you get back.

352
00:19:25,376 --> 00:19:26,741
Forward...

353
00:19:27,144 --> 00:19:28,975
...ho!

354
00:19:31,282 --> 00:19:32,647
See you!

355
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:35,114
Have a great time!

356
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,354
You got your road map and stuff?

357
00:19:38,556 --> 00:19:40,615
I think I'm all set, fellas.

358
00:19:40,825 --> 00:19:42,019
What you got in here?

359
00:19:42,226 --> 00:19:44,057
That's a little thing I picked up.

360
00:19:44,261 --> 00:19:45,922
Will you do some fishing?

361
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:47,620
I'm going to the dog show.

362
00:19:47,832 --> 00:19:49,857
They ain't got no lakes or rivers?

363
00:19:50,067 --> 00:19:52,968
I don't think I'll have much time
to do that.

364
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:56,970
Good luck, Hubert!
Go put some hurt on them Yankee dogs.

365
00:19:57,174 --> 00:19:59,734
-Thanks.
-We'll take care of everything.

366
00:19:59,944 --> 00:20:01,468
Don't have worry about nothing.

367
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:02,771
We got it in order.

368
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:06,347
This is that tape I was telling you
about with the funny songs.

369
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,984
-It's real good for the road.
-Thanks.

370
00:20:10,688 --> 00:20:13,782
-Bon voyage, Hubert. Good luck.
-Catch a big one!

371
00:20:13,991 --> 00:20:16,755
Have a good time!
Hubert, who'll catch a big fish?

372
00:20:16,961 --> 00:20:19,088
-Who's going fishing?
-Go get them.

373
00:20:19,296 --> 00:20:21,059
-You the dog!
-Have a good time.

374
00:20:21,265 --> 00:20:25,565
If you get tired, pull over.
If you get hungry, eat something.

375
00:20:28,973 --> 00:20:30,668
See you, Hubert!

376
00:20:30,908 --> 00:20:33,001
Don't forget the tape!

377
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,674
Well, we've started...

378
00:20:37,882 --> 00:20:40,214
...you can call a little bit
of superstition on my part...

379
00:20:40,417 --> 00:20:43,750
...but I always like to put up
the official curtain, so to speak...

380
00:20:43,954 --> 00:20:46,422
...because this curtain here
will carry the...

381
00:20:46,624 --> 00:20:49,149
...official symbol
of the Mayflower Dog Show.

382
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,592
Really spread the arms, guys,
so it doesn't get dirty. Thanks.

383
00:20:53,831 --> 00:20:56,698
Behind it is the holding area
where the chief steward will be.

384
00:20:56,901 --> 00:20:59,961
He'll make sure everybody has the
proper armbands, so they can....

385
00:21:00,171 --> 00:21:03,572
Identifying the dog with the handler
is very important, of course.

386
00:21:03,774 --> 00:21:07,835
All that anxiety and chaos happens
behind the curtain. It's good.

387
00:21:08,045 --> 00:21:11,310
These people here can enjoy
the show and not see that.

388
00:21:11,515 --> 00:21:14,678
Really shake it out there.
Let's get the dirt off it.

389
00:21:14,885 --> 00:21:17,820
That's it. Been in a box for a year.

390
00:21:18,489 --> 00:21:20,889
Oh, these have to come...

391
00:21:21,091 --> 00:21:23,719
-...because....
-Counting those...

392
00:21:23,928 --> 00:21:26,556
...you've already packed
six kimonos.

393
00:21:26,764 --> 00:21:28,857
All right, so here is seven.

394
00:21:29,066 --> 00:21:31,899
We're in Philadelphia for 48 hours.

395
00:21:32,469 --> 00:21:35,199
That's seven, so I need,
actually, one more.

396
00:21:35,406 --> 00:21:37,067
How many tea services can you do?

397
00:21:37,274 --> 00:21:40,971
Why are you doing this? I think
we're overpacking. Don't you?

398
00:21:41,378 --> 00:21:42,675
No!

399
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:48,350
There's a local honky-tonk

400
00:21:48,552 --> 00:21:50,281
Down in Louisiana

401
00:21:50,487 --> 00:21:52,921
Where the biscuits and gravy

402
00:21:53,123 --> 00:21:56,058
Are like Dixie 's manna

403
00:21:56,427 --> 00:21:58,861
Let's go honky-tonk now

404
00:22:00,497 --> 00:22:03,261
I used to be able to name every nut...

405
00:22:04,134 --> 00:22:05,294
...that there was.

406
00:22:05,502 --> 00:22:08,369
That used to drive my mother crazy.
She used to say:

407
00:22:08,572 --> 00:22:12,941
"Harlan Pepper, if you don't stop
naming nuts...."

408
00:22:13,143 --> 00:22:15,703
The joke was that we lived
in Pinenut...

409
00:22:15,913 --> 00:22:20,009
...and I think that's what put it
in my head at that point.

410
00:22:20,217 --> 00:22:24,313
I'd go to sleep, she'd hear me,
she would just start yelling.

411
00:22:24,922 --> 00:22:26,719
I'd say, "Peanut.

412
00:22:27,491 --> 00:22:29,015
Hazelnut.

413
00:22:29,627 --> 00:22:31,424
Cashew nut.

414
00:22:33,097 --> 00:22:36,225
Macadamia nut." That was the one that
would send her...

415
00:22:36,433 --> 00:22:37,832
...into...

416
00:22:38,168 --> 00:22:41,934
...going crazy. She said,
"You stop naming nuts!"

417
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:45,599
And Hubert used to be able to make
the sound.

418
00:22:45,809 --> 00:22:48,175
He wasn't talking,
but he used to go....

419
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,874
And it sounded like Macadamia nut.

420
00:22:52,449 --> 00:22:53,939
Pine nut...

421
00:22:54,318 --> 00:22:57,446
...which is a nut, but it's also
the name of the town.

422
00:22:58,789 --> 00:23:00,757
Pistachio nut.

423
00:23:01,292 --> 00:23:03,283
Red pistachio nut.

424
00:23:03,494 --> 00:23:07,225
Natural, all-natural,
white pistachio nut.

425
00:23:08,499 --> 00:23:10,330
Is that everything?
With all the bags?

426
00:23:10,534 --> 00:23:12,764
-It doesn't look like everything.
-What?

427
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:15,302
-It doesn't look like everything.
-I counted.

428
00:23:15,506 --> 00:23:16,598
It doesn't look like it.

429
00:23:16,807 --> 00:23:18,434
Next time, call a car service.

430
00:23:18,642 --> 00:23:21,634
You should be on time, then
we won't have to take a taxi.

431
00:23:21,845 --> 00:23:22,812
I can't hear you!

432
00:23:23,013 --> 00:23:25,948
If you were ready on time,
we wouldn't have to take a taxi.

433
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:29,085
If we had a car service,
they'd pick us up on time.

434
00:23:29,286 --> 00:23:30,981
Meg, do you have the tickets?

435
00:23:32,022 --> 00:23:33,717
Do you have the tickets?

436
00:23:33,924 --> 00:23:36,188
-You have the tickets.
-No, I do not.

437
00:23:36,894 --> 00:23:39,294
-What kind of dog is that?
-A Weimaraner.

438
00:23:39,496 --> 00:23:40,758
You have the tickets.

439
00:23:40,965 --> 00:23:42,398
How are you, little fella?

440
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:44,027
What did you do?

441
00:23:44,435 --> 00:23:47,836
-Did you provoke her?
-What did you do? Did you pinch her?

442
00:23:48,038 --> 00:23:49,096
He almost took off my hand!

443
00:23:49,306 --> 00:23:51,934
You just get walking, buddy,
right now!

444
00:23:52,142 --> 00:23:55,168
I'll file a personal assault charge
against you.

445
00:23:55,379 --> 00:23:57,108
Put a muzzle on that, and yourself!

446
00:23:57,314 --> 00:24:01,011
-You don't know who you're talking to!
-Crazy people, crazy dog!

447
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:03,308
Here we go, come on.

448
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,284
He's a mean man. Here you go.

449
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:08,185
Take your busy bee. Come on, winner.

450
00:24:08,392 --> 00:24:10,553
-Oh, no! Come on!
-Meg, settle down.

451
00:24:10,761 --> 00:24:13,321
She's not even reacting to the toy.

452
00:24:14,898 --> 00:24:15,956
1 -1 -7-2-8

453
00:24:16,467 --> 00:24:19,129
1 -1 -7....

454
00:24:20,637 --> 00:24:21,899
It's on this side.

455
00:24:22,106 --> 00:24:24,074
2-8.

456
00:24:24,675 --> 00:24:27,508
2-6. Here we go!

457
00:24:27,711 --> 00:24:29,008
That's it.

458
00:24:29,213 --> 00:24:30,874
Oh, my God!

459
00:24:31,081 --> 00:24:32,639
What a dump!

460
00:24:32,916 --> 00:24:36,079
-You said they got a better place.
-They did.

461
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,381
If you live in skid row.

462
00:24:40,457 --> 00:24:42,687
You did it. Good dog.

463
00:24:42,926 --> 00:24:45,190
I'm getting heart palpitations.

464
00:24:46,397 --> 00:24:48,228
-I can't help it.
-Listen to me.

465
00:24:48,432 --> 00:24:50,627
Max is so history!

466
00:24:50,901 --> 00:24:52,334
Who's my future?

467
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,701
Well, let's...

468
00:24:58,175 --> 00:24:59,267
...get going!

469
00:24:59,943 --> 00:25:02,070
Hi! Welcome!

470
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:03,576
Nice to see you!

471
00:25:03,781 --> 00:25:05,248
-Good to see you.
-How are you?

472
00:25:05,449 --> 00:25:06,609
It's so nice. Great!

473
00:25:06,817 --> 00:25:09,047
-Nice house.
-Yes, what a wonderful....

474
00:25:09,253 --> 00:25:13,087
-Oh, nice to see you.
-Good to see you. It's been so long.

475
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:15,383
-Gerry, how's the boy?
-Hello, Max.

476
00:25:15,592 --> 00:25:17,924
Watch out for that one.

477
00:25:18,128 --> 00:25:20,494
-Hey, Cookie
-Oh, Max.

478
00:25:20,931 --> 00:25:22,990
Twice, like the French.
Come here, boy.

479
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,260
-You remember Winky?
-He's a sweet boy, he's fuzzy.

480
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:29,837
-God bless him. Here, go to Daddy.
-What?

481
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,508
Fay, thank you so much for letting--

482
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,838
Come on, let me show you around.

483
00:25:38,982 --> 00:25:40,882
I'll go get the bags.

484
00:25:43,887 --> 00:25:45,582
This is our biggest week of the year.

485
00:25:47,324 --> 00:25:49,451
We're a popular hotel year-round...

486
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:52,060
...but now is when
we feel excitement...

487
00:25:52,262 --> 00:25:55,754
...when the dog show comes through,
and all the familiar faces...

488
00:25:56,467 --> 00:25:57,764
...canine and, you know...

489
00:25:57,968 --> 00:26:01,768
...human alike come and we get
to see our friends again...

490
00:26:01,972 --> 00:26:04,566
...and make the place ready.
Lots of work.

491
00:26:04,775 --> 00:26:08,575
The key to welcoming animals
into a hotel is...

492
00:26:08,779 --> 00:26:10,974
...maintaining a level of hygiene.

493
00:26:11,181 --> 00:26:13,672
And that's what this room
is all about.

494
00:26:13,884 --> 00:26:17,479
We're pretty well-supplied here
for any kind of contingency.

495
00:26:17,688 --> 00:26:19,815
Your small dogs, your big dogs.

496
00:26:20,023 --> 00:26:23,288
This is a good, safe product,
doesn't have bad odor...

497
00:26:23,494 --> 00:26:26,361
...chemical smell for small stains,
usually small dogs...

498
00:26:26,563 --> 00:26:29,464
...Pomeranian, your little
teacup Poodle, what have you.

499
00:26:29,666 --> 00:26:31,099
This is a good product.

500
00:26:31,301 --> 00:26:36,204
Sometimes, your bigger dog, your Great
Dane, your Bull Mastiff, Rottweiler...

501
00:26:36,406 --> 00:26:41,173
...you need to up the ante a little bit.
This is another good cleaning product.

502
00:26:41,378 --> 00:26:43,403
For the big critters,
the big stains...

503
00:26:43,614 --> 00:26:47,380
...sometimes you need the nuclear
weaponry, the sodium hydrochloride.

504
00:26:48,619 --> 00:26:51,884
I don't know if I can say,
I won't mention names...

505
00:26:52,089 --> 00:26:53,681
...we had a rock group here...

506
00:26:53,891 --> 00:26:56,860
...so we put down the rubber sheets
in the beds...

507
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:59,824
...but apparently they didn't see
the toilet in the room.

508
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:04,262
So we had a lot of cleaning to do
after they checked out.

509
00:27:04,468 --> 00:27:08,029
Roasting a goat in the room,
I still don't understand.

510
00:27:08,238 --> 00:27:10,069
Getting the smell of...

511
00:27:10,274 --> 00:27:13,539
...cumin and charcoal out
of the drapes was a chore.

512
00:27:13,744 --> 00:27:15,006
That was a big deal.

513
00:27:15,212 --> 00:27:17,373
We get an imprint
of the credit card now.

514
00:27:17,581 --> 00:27:18,980
We learned from that one.

515
00:27:19,583 --> 00:27:22,416
-This is great. Thank you.
-You're welcome.

516
00:27:22,619 --> 00:27:24,382
-Super.
-It's like...

517
00:27:24,588 --> 00:27:26,818
...l know it tastes better,
but it looks like that...

518
00:27:27,024 --> 00:27:29,185
...cafeteria hot-plate food.
You know?

519
00:27:29,393 --> 00:27:32,055
Which I never tasted.
I didn't want to look like a loser.

520
00:27:32,262 --> 00:27:33,388
But it tastes good.

521
00:27:33,597 --> 00:27:37,533
I had that food every single day.
And it was 50 cents back then.

522
00:27:37,734 --> 00:27:38,928
It was pretty cheap.

523
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,728
What's that you've got there?

524
00:27:40,938 --> 00:27:43,736
-A parachuter.
-A parachuter!

525
00:27:43,974 --> 00:27:45,942
It's not a doll.
It's an action figure.

526
00:27:46,143 --> 00:27:47,610
It is an action figure.

527
00:27:47,811 --> 00:27:49,745
Yes, you got that right. So, so...

528
00:27:49,947 --> 00:27:52,279
...what does that, what is--?

529
00:27:52,482 --> 00:27:54,609
What do you do with the parachuter?

530
00:27:54,818 --> 00:27:56,683
It goes up and down like this.

531
00:27:56,887 --> 00:27:59,048
Honey, don't let it fall in your food.

532
00:27:59,256 --> 00:28:00,985
Mommy's not mad, but don't.

533
00:28:01,191 --> 00:28:04,354
-Is it okay if I let Winky walk around?
-Yeah.

534
00:28:04,561 --> 00:28:06,392
I've got my puffer. It's okay.

535
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:10,356
I had a terrible day today.

536
00:28:10,567 --> 00:28:13,092
I can't get rid of it in my head.

537
00:28:13,704 --> 00:28:16,138
You have a bad day,
someone returns a sweater.

538
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:19,138
I do and lives get lost.
People lose their lives.

539
00:28:20,577 --> 00:28:24,240
I'm the chief hostage negotiator
for the Akron and tri-county area.

540
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:28,817
I talk people down. When they get
a jumper on a building, they call me.

541
00:28:29,753 --> 00:28:33,348
How many people have you talked down?

542
00:28:33,557 --> 00:28:34,581
I mean, is there a...?

543
00:28:34,925 --> 00:28:36,449
Well, they always jump.

544
00:28:37,027 --> 00:28:40,224
It's a little secret from the trade.
They all jump.

545
00:28:40,564 --> 00:28:43,260
But today, we had a tough one.
There's a guy, he jumps...

546
00:28:43,467 --> 00:28:45,901
...that doesn't bother me, it happens
all the time.

547
00:28:46,403 --> 00:28:48,530
You think they drop like rocks. No.

548
00:28:48,739 --> 00:28:50,730
He hit a gargoyle on the way down.

549
00:28:50,941 --> 00:28:54,809
He gets his head caught in
the gargoyle's mouth. The head...

550
00:28:55,612 --> 00:28:59,446
...pops off like a grape, the body
spins down like a whirligig.

551
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:01,112
When they hit...

552
00:29:01,318 --> 00:29:03,013
...everything pops out.
It's like a pinata.

553
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:06,053
The intestines, like they're
spring-loaded...

554
00:29:06,456 --> 00:29:07,684
...pop out.

555
00:29:07,891 --> 00:29:09,791
Forgive me. You know what?

556
00:29:09,993 --> 00:29:12,757
I was remembering
that time with you and me at the lake.

557
00:29:13,196 --> 00:29:14,686
With the pinata. Remember?

558
00:29:14,898 --> 00:29:16,957
Are you sure that was you?

559
00:29:17,167 --> 00:29:19,192
-I think you know who it was.
-I know.

560
00:29:19,403 --> 00:29:20,734
It was a long time ago, and....

561
00:29:20,937 --> 00:29:22,598
Seems like last week.

562
00:29:22,806 --> 00:29:24,364
You wouldn't know, she was famous...

563
00:29:24,574 --> 00:29:27,441
...for putting both her legs
behind her head.

564
00:29:28,578 --> 00:29:30,205
He's like an animal.

565
00:29:30,414 --> 00:29:33,542
-No, it's just talk!
-He's just like an animal.

566
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:36,184
Pinata?
I don't know what a pinata is.

567
00:29:36,386 --> 00:29:41,119
I forgot to compliment you on your
luscious melon breasts tonight.

568
00:29:41,325 --> 00:29:43,418
-How does that sound?
-Oh, come on!

569
00:29:43,627 --> 00:29:45,925
-What are you talking about now?
-Thank you.

570
00:29:46,129 --> 00:29:48,256
What you don't understand is...

571
00:29:48,498 --> 00:29:50,591
...a picture is worth
a thousand words.

572
00:29:50,801 --> 00:29:54,293
I only went through 1 25 or 130
words describing that.

573
00:29:54,504 --> 00:29:56,768
If I wanted,
I could go 800 words more.

574
00:29:56,973 --> 00:30:00,534
-I'll take the picture because--
-Do you know where Winky is?

575
00:30:00,744 --> 00:30:03,338
Next time, I'll get a picture.
How about that?

576
00:30:03,847 --> 00:30:05,280
Where's the dog?

577
00:30:06,016 --> 00:30:07,711
-The what?
-Winky. Where's Winky?

578
00:30:08,251 --> 00:30:10,481
-Who's Winky?
-He's probably with Zach.

579
00:30:10,687 --> 00:30:13,247
-Oh, the dog.
-Oh, my God!

580
00:30:14,057 --> 00:30:16,457
Winky? Winky?

581
00:30:17,527 --> 00:30:18,926
-What?
-What's going on?

582
00:30:19,129 --> 00:30:20,289
What are you doing?

583
00:30:20,497 --> 00:30:23,159
-Winky, it's okay, baby.
-Don't move, Zach.

584
00:30:23,367 --> 00:30:26,165
-Zach, listen.
-He has a parachute around his neck!

585
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:30,136
-Please, honey, this is what I do.
-Don't be mad at him, please.

586
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:33,901
I'll gouge your eye out with my thumb.
I shit you not, you freak.

587
00:30:34,111 --> 00:30:38,047
Get down! I'm gonna punch you
in the eye till it turns to jelly.

588
00:30:38,782 --> 00:30:41,945
Don't look at him in the eyes,
it challenges him.

589
00:30:42,152 --> 00:30:44,382
I'll stab you with forks
until you bleed!

590
00:30:45,422 --> 00:30:46,411
Hey.

591
00:30:46,623 --> 00:30:48,818
Hey, little buddy,
what you been doing?

592
00:30:49,025 --> 00:30:50,720
Oh, nothing.

593
00:30:51,194 --> 00:30:54,595
Now, I understand that you went
to the circus.

594
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:58,359
I did. I saw the Hat Lady.
Hat Lady.

595
00:30:58,568 --> 00:31:01,162
"Fat." "Fat."

596
00:31:01,371 --> 00:31:04,340
Hat Lady. F-f-hat Lady.

597
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:11,169
Fat. How do you say "F"?
That isn't in here.

598
00:31:11,748 --> 00:31:13,511
"Chubby Lady." That's easier.

599
00:31:13,717 --> 00:31:15,947
-I saw the Chucky--
-No, that's "chucky."

600
00:31:16,153 --> 00:31:18,280
-Chucky Lady.
-Chub. Chubby.

601
00:31:18,488 --> 00:31:20,854
-Choky.
-Chuggy, chug--

602
00:31:21,057 --> 00:31:22,718
Hey. Hey.

603
00:31:24,394 --> 00:31:28,194
What you doing, Bloodhound doggy?

604
00:31:28,398 --> 00:31:30,866
That's a easy one,
"Bloodhound," isn't it?

605
00:31:31,067 --> 00:31:32,193
Yeah.

606
00:31:32,569 --> 00:31:35,163
-Yeah.
-You going to sleep?

607
00:31:40,076 --> 00:31:43,204
-The doorman's approximately cute.
-The Mediterranean type.

608
00:31:43,413 --> 00:31:45,643
-I'll say!
-You gotta trim their nose hair.

609
00:31:45,849 --> 00:31:48,409
-Hi. May I help you?
-Vanderhoof.

610
00:31:48,618 --> 00:31:52,418
-V-A-N--
-D-E-R-H-double O-F.

611
00:31:52,622 --> 00:31:55,614
Non-smoking, two nights.
We have you down for a queen.

612
00:31:56,092 --> 00:31:57,923
-What are you suggesting...
-Quiet.

613
00:31:58,128 --> 00:31:59,152
...my dear man?

614
00:32:01,131 --> 00:32:02,621
Do you want to use a card?

615
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:04,494
-Oh, yes.
-Talk to Daddy.

616
00:32:05,101 --> 00:32:06,466
Seen enough dogs today?

617
00:32:06,937 --> 00:32:08,700
Dogs? Yes. Big show.

618
00:32:09,072 --> 00:32:12,974
-There's a lot of them in the hotel.
-A lot of them here in the lobby.

619
00:32:13,176 --> 00:32:14,507
Okay.

620
00:32:15,312 --> 00:32:18,577
If I could get you to sign here?

621
00:32:18,782 --> 00:32:20,647
-How tall are you?
-6' 4."

622
00:32:20,851 --> 00:32:24,287
Oh, I thought so. I feel like
Alan Ladd at Easter lsland.

623
00:32:24,488 --> 00:32:25,978
6' 4."

624
00:32:26,189 --> 00:32:28,919
Where you from? Like, Nor--
Nor-land? Norway?

625
00:32:29,125 --> 00:32:32,891
-I'm lrish-German.
-Like Robert Duvall in The Godfather.

626
00:32:33,096 --> 00:32:36,293
Bratwurst and shillelaghs.
Paging Dr. Freud!

627
00:32:37,701 --> 00:32:41,193
-But this time, Robin will make it.
-Okay.

628
00:32:41,404 --> 00:32:44,237
-Bake at 400?
-Yeah. For a very short time.

629
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:48,643
-Hi.
-Hi. How you doing?

630
00:32:48,845 --> 00:32:50,870
I'm Jana, the production assistant.

631
00:32:51,081 --> 00:32:53,242
They're ready. I'll take you on over.

632
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:55,213
It's showtime, baby.

633
00:32:55,719 --> 00:32:57,311
Come on, little poochie.

634
00:33:07,497 --> 00:33:10,398
-You were wonderful.
-You were magic.

635
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,000
Don't forget, Saturday
we have reservations.

636
00:33:13,203 --> 00:33:15,433
Look.
They're having spring rolls.

637
00:33:16,072 --> 00:33:17,903
-Hi.
-Hey! Hi, I'm Robin.

638
00:33:18,108 --> 00:33:19,905
-I'm Christy.
-How are you?

639
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:22,169
-I'm Chuck.
-My God! You're so short!

640
00:33:22,379 --> 00:33:23,744
Camera adds a few inches.

641
00:33:23,947 --> 00:33:27,212
I saw you in a store a year ago.
You looked beautiful.

642
00:33:27,417 --> 00:33:28,441
Oh, thank you.

643
00:33:28,652 --> 00:33:32,315
-And this is....
-This is Butch! "Rhapsody in White."

644
00:33:32,522 --> 00:33:34,513
Butch? But isn't Butch a bitch?

645
00:33:34,724 --> 00:33:37,784
-Butch is a bitch.
-Robin and Chuck, be ready in 10.

646
00:33:37,994 --> 00:33:41,361
-There's coffee if you're interested.
-Oh, thank you. Yes.

647
00:33:41,565 --> 00:33:43,226
-Five seconds.
-Here we go.

648
00:33:43,433 --> 00:33:46,596
-I love Japanese food.
-I have to rearrange.

649
00:33:46,803 --> 00:33:48,031
Energy.

650
00:33:48,572 --> 00:33:49,561
And we're back!

651
00:33:49,773 --> 00:33:51,741
It's a big night here tomorrow.

652
00:33:51,942 --> 00:33:54,911
The Mayflower's
Annual IKennel Club Dog Show.

653
00:33:55,111 --> 00:33:59,275
And with us, owner Sherri Ann Cabot
and handler Christy Cummings...

654
00:33:59,482 --> 00:34:02,610
...with their two-time champion,
Rhapsody in White. Welcome.

655
00:34:02,819 --> 00:34:04,343
-Welcome-- Thank you!
-Yes.

656
00:34:04,554 --> 00:34:06,886
Well, I am particular about my hair.

657
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:10,651
-But this...!
-Well, this takes about two hours.

658
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:14,057
What's with the plumber-butt thing
happening on the hip?

659
00:34:14,431 --> 00:34:18,561
These pom-poms are keeping
Butch's hips warm from the cold water.

660
00:34:18,768 --> 00:34:22,795
-The hip joints. It's very important.
-The little drummerette things that--

661
00:34:23,006 --> 00:34:25,600
-Right. We keep--
-Those act as flippers.

662
00:34:26,576 --> 00:34:27,634
Right.

663
00:34:28,211 --> 00:34:31,874
-Look at this, sweetie.
-Look, Winky! Look, darling!

664
00:34:34,884 --> 00:34:36,442
Welcome. May I help you?

665
00:34:36,653 --> 00:34:39,850
Yes. You are sure to have
a reservation for Fleck.

666
00:34:40,056 --> 00:34:41,455
Mayflower group.

667
00:34:42,826 --> 00:34:46,159
Great. Gerald and Cookie Fleck.
We got you for two nights.

668
00:34:46,363 --> 00:34:49,491
-Queen-size, non-smoking.
-That is correct, sir.

669
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:52,600
-You want to put this on a credit card?
-Yes.

670
00:34:53,136 --> 00:34:55,263
Drove up from Florida.

671
00:34:55,472 --> 00:34:56,461
Well, welcome.

672
00:34:56,673 --> 00:34:59,233
-Thank you very much.
-How was the drive?

673
00:34:59,442 --> 00:35:02,934
Oh, just super! Put a few clicks
on the old odometer...

674
00:35:03,146 --> 00:35:06,115
...let me put it that way.
Good weather for most of it.

675
00:35:06,316 --> 00:35:09,183
A little cloudy
coming up through West Virginia.

676
00:35:09,386 --> 00:35:12,219
Then it stayed overcast
through Virginia.

677
00:35:12,422 --> 00:35:16,518
But once we get into Pennsylvania,
it's still overcast.

678
00:35:17,027 --> 00:35:19,996
Now, there's a little problem.

679
00:35:20,196 --> 00:35:22,289
Do you have another credit card?

680
00:35:22,799 --> 00:35:24,426
No. That's the good one.

681
00:35:25,035 --> 00:35:26,764
-That should work.
-Give it a rub.

682
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:29,996
Yeah, check the strip.
Sometimes the change or the keys....

683
00:35:31,141 --> 00:35:35,134
No, you see,
it's coming up bad each time.

684
00:35:35,345 --> 00:35:37,438
That's a mistake. That's a good card.

685
00:35:37,647 --> 00:35:39,877
-Do you have another--?
-That's the good card.

686
00:35:40,083 --> 00:35:43,052
I think you should call them,
because that's a mistake.

687
00:35:43,253 --> 00:35:45,221
-I'll call them.
-Don't worry, Gerry.

688
00:35:45,889 --> 00:35:48,915
I had to pay the cable, the gas,
and the water.

689
00:35:49,125 --> 00:35:53,755
-It's gotta be a mistake, honey.
-They're off our backs, but this....

690
00:35:53,963 --> 00:35:57,990
Do you want to talk to the cardholder?
Because he wants to talk to you.

691
00:35:58,201 --> 00:36:02,729
Yes, yes. Hello? Yes.
Who am I speaking to?

692
00:36:02,939 --> 00:36:04,804
Doreen? This is Gerry Fleck--

693
00:36:05,008 --> 00:36:06,771
Tell them they sent one notice.

694
00:36:06,976 --> 00:36:10,343
We're having a problem
with our card here, and-- Yes.

695
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:13,549
We have till two to pay it.
Tell her we have till two.

696
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:15,945
Till two notices.
We don't have to pay on--

697
00:36:16,152 --> 00:36:17,642
Well, two notices.

698
00:36:17,854 --> 00:36:22,621
My wife does all the bill-paying.
She's not a forgetful person.

699
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,684
Hang on.

700
00:36:25,328 --> 00:36:27,159
Two notices, honey. They've--

701
00:36:27,363 --> 00:36:30,423
-Could I offer another suggestion?
-That's bull!

702
00:36:30,633 --> 00:36:33,602
If you had cash
for two nights' deposit, then we'll--

703
00:36:33,803 --> 00:36:36,135
Yes. Yes.

704
00:36:36,506 --> 00:36:37,871
How much?

705
00:36:38,074 --> 00:36:40,201
$1 50 a night. That's $300.

706
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:44,073
And you'd be refunded a substantial
portion of that on checkout.

707
00:36:46,716 --> 00:36:48,877
We don't have $300.

708
00:36:49,085 --> 00:36:50,416
We....

709
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,212
Well, I've got...

710
00:36:52,655 --> 00:36:54,384
...thirty-four.

711
00:36:56,259 --> 00:36:57,954
What about traveler's checks?

712
00:36:58,161 --> 00:37:00,322
We certainly take traveler's checks.

713
00:37:01,397 --> 00:37:03,763
-Did you get some?
-No.

714
00:37:07,203 --> 00:37:08,727
Let me see what I can do.

715
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,701
The excitement's starting to build.

716
00:37:12,909 --> 00:37:17,608
Butch has a light in her eyes
that says it's showtime.

717
00:37:17,814 --> 00:37:20,408
This is the beginning of our ritual...

718
00:37:20,617 --> 00:37:23,586
...this party, our preshow ritual
for the Mayflower.

719
00:37:23,787 --> 00:37:26,119
And we just did the official toast.

720
00:37:26,322 --> 00:37:29,951
And the way it goes is that
when the ice sculpture--

721
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,594
--which, as you can see, is Butch--

722
00:37:32,796 --> 00:37:36,357
--when it melts all the way down,
the party's over.

723
00:37:36,566 --> 00:37:39,865
And it looks like tomorrow's
gonna be a beautiful day.

724
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:44,303
This year, we're adding a new element
to the preshow ritual.

725
00:37:44,507 --> 00:37:47,169
Sherri will do my makeup.
I'm very excited--

726
00:37:47,377 --> 00:37:52,371
It's a way for me to relax,
and to show, again, my art.

727
00:37:52,582 --> 00:37:55,210
And she's the epitome of glamour,
you know...

728
00:37:55,418 --> 00:37:57,886
...so I feel like I'm in good hands.

729
00:37:58,087 --> 00:38:00,248
I think she could use some glamour.

730
00:38:00,456 --> 00:38:03,254
Well, I don't know.
I'm not you, that's for sure.

731
00:38:03,693 --> 00:38:05,661
I apologize. This is all we have.

732
00:38:05,862 --> 00:38:08,023
We are so full up.

733
00:38:09,566 --> 00:38:12,091
We don't want you out in the cold.

734
00:38:12,302 --> 00:38:15,499
This will give you
some sort of a place to stay.

735
00:38:15,705 --> 00:38:18,902
Don't judge it by this.
We're gonna clean this stuff out...

736
00:38:19,108 --> 00:38:21,633
...and bring in a cot,
make it comfy for you.

737
00:38:21,845 --> 00:38:24,643
-Good. Oh, it's super. Really super.
-Yeah.

738
00:38:24,848 --> 00:38:27,009
-Is there a bathroom?
-Two flights down.

739
00:38:27,217 --> 00:38:29,014
It's the lobby bathroom.

740
00:38:29,219 --> 00:38:32,245
It's stocked with paper towels,
toilet tissue and soap.

741
00:38:32,455 --> 00:38:34,252
You can freshen up in there.

742
00:38:35,191 --> 00:38:36,317
Thank you.

743
00:38:37,794 --> 00:38:40,194
-Room service?
-That's the good news.

744
00:38:40,396 --> 00:38:42,557
You're next to the kitchen.
Literally.

745
00:38:42,765 --> 00:38:47,532
Grab somebody and get a menu.
And you'll be able to order from them.

746
00:38:47,737 --> 00:38:51,366
And say just "utility closet"?

747
00:38:51,574 --> 00:38:55,032
As a matter of fact, yeah.
I don't think we'll have a problem.

748
00:38:55,245 --> 00:38:57,611
I'll alert the staff
to your presence too.

749
00:38:57,814 --> 00:38:59,805
I've gotta get back to the desk...

750
00:39:00,016 --> 00:39:02,746
...but anything you need,
ask for Mark Schaefer.

751
00:39:02,952 --> 00:39:04,715
-Thanks so much.
-Thank you, Mark.

752
00:39:04,921 --> 00:39:06,149
-Thank you.
-Bye-bye.

753
00:39:08,124 --> 00:39:10,718
I think I'll switch
to the mock turtleneck.

754
00:39:10,927 --> 00:39:13,760
-The charcoal one from Saks.
-Great. Okay.

755
00:39:13,963 --> 00:39:15,362
Is that not breathing or...?

756
00:39:15,565 --> 00:39:18,125
Well, it's breathing now,
but at the party...

757
00:39:18,334 --> 00:39:20,234
...it's gonna be hot down there.

758
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:24,567
Then again, it goes so well
with the trousers.

759
00:39:24,941 --> 00:39:27,034
Or I could go with the lamb's wool.

760
00:39:27,911 --> 00:39:30,880
Then again, you're gonna see a lot
of khaki down there.

761
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,571
And this merlot looks good
with the gray.

762
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:35,383
You know what?

763
00:39:35,952 --> 00:39:37,886
-Maybe we should stay.
-What?

764
00:39:38,087 --> 00:39:40,555
We shouldn't leave her up here alone.

765
00:39:40,757 --> 00:39:44,284
We have to go. We have to make
an appearance. You know that.

766
00:39:44,494 --> 00:39:47,622
-Are you upset, baby?
-Yes, of course she's upset.

767
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:49,263
Don't be upset.

768
00:39:49,465 --> 00:39:52,559
Mommy and Daddy are only gonna--
Don't, not the lips.

769
00:39:52,769 --> 00:39:55,294
Mommy and Daddy are going
for a little bit.

770
00:39:55,505 --> 00:39:59,100
And we'll be back. Huh?
You got your busy bee.

771
00:39:59,309 --> 00:40:01,470
-You got busy bee.
-Oh, I want to stay.

772
00:40:01,678 --> 00:40:02,804
-You can't.
-I want to.

773
00:40:03,012 --> 00:40:04,172
-You can't.
-I want to.

774
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,745
You can't stay.

775
00:40:10,353 --> 00:40:13,186
-More Gouda, honey?
-No, thanks, Gerry.

776
00:40:13,556 --> 00:40:15,581
-Super party, huh?
-Yeah, but--

777
00:40:15,792 --> 00:40:19,558
You know, I ran into that woman
that owned the Terrier.

778
00:40:19,762 --> 00:40:24,597
From Florida. We were in that show.
The Elvis, not Costello.

779
00:40:24,801 --> 00:40:28,237
-Remember that little Terrier?
-The bitch that pushed Winky?

780
00:40:28,438 --> 00:40:30,235
Pushed him way off his gait?

781
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,533
Cookie Googleman?

782
00:40:32,742 --> 00:40:35,438
-Yeah.
-It is you. Malcolm!

783
00:40:35,912 --> 00:40:37,277
Malcolm?

784
00:40:38,581 --> 00:40:40,845
Gerry, my husband. This is Malcolm.

785
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:43,883
-What's shaking?
-Not much, Gary. How are you?

786
00:40:44,087 --> 00:40:46,521
-Doesn't she look fantastic?
-Boy, I'll say.

787
00:40:46,723 --> 00:40:48,281
-Thank you.
-Just fantastic.

788
00:40:48,491 --> 00:40:51,824
Been what? I don't know,
18, 1 9 years? Louisville.

789
00:40:52,729 --> 00:40:55,425
The Mint Julep.
You were working as a waitress.

790
00:40:55,631 --> 00:40:56,859
Wow.

791
00:40:57,734 --> 00:40:59,895
Malcolm. Malcolm, Malcolm, Malcolm.

792
00:41:01,004 --> 00:41:03,370
I've banged a lot
of waitresses in my day.

793
00:41:03,573 --> 00:41:05,438
But you were the best. By far.

794
00:41:05,641 --> 00:41:08,269
-You don't forget the best.
-Nope.

795
00:41:08,478 --> 00:41:10,275
Oh, Gerry. Oh, Gerry.

796
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,313
They gotta do something
about the air conditioning.

797
00:41:13,516 --> 00:41:14,608
Great to see you.

798
00:41:14,817 --> 00:41:16,182
Nice to see you, Malcolm.

799
00:41:16,386 --> 00:41:17,819
IKeep them up. IKeep them up.

800
00:41:18,021 --> 00:41:22,515
The beat goes on, okay?
The beat goes on. Gerry, my husband.

801
00:41:22,725 --> 00:41:24,420
Don't worry, I know where I am.

802
00:41:24,627 --> 00:41:26,458
-Just....
-But that was fun.

803
00:41:28,197 --> 00:41:31,098
Your house is beautiful.
The food, delicious.

804
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:34,599
And to see Butch with her crown on.
It's so cute.

805
00:41:34,804 --> 00:41:37,170
That's her game face.
Absolutely right.

806
00:41:37,373 --> 00:41:39,034
-She winked at me.
-Did she?

807
00:41:39,242 --> 00:41:41,301
-She winked at me.
-You little flirt.

808
00:41:42,011 --> 00:41:44,878
She's not gonna wear
the crown tomorrow, is she?

809
00:41:45,081 --> 00:41:49,484
-She'll walk around as if she were.
-It is. It's a fun party.

810
00:41:49,685 --> 00:41:52,882
-We only do that once a year.
-She must be very proud.

811
00:41:53,089 --> 00:41:54,283
-You bet.
-Oh, yeah.

812
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:56,685
-It's her night.
-It is. She's the star.

813
00:41:56,893 --> 00:41:59,657
And hopefully, she's going to be
the star tomorrow.

814
00:41:59,862 --> 00:42:01,830
-We'll have to see.
-That's up to her.

815
00:42:02,031 --> 00:42:05,262
-I guess. And some other people.
-It's in her hands.

816
00:42:05,468 --> 00:42:08,460
Some think if you're on a small creek,
a small body of water...

817
00:42:08,671 --> 00:42:10,502
...that you have to use a small fly.

818
00:42:10,706 --> 00:42:13,368
But I've been in situations,
even on a big river...

819
00:42:13,576 --> 00:42:17,512
...where I'm using a size 18,
a size 20, a size 22.

820
00:42:17,713 --> 00:42:20,739
I go with a dropper
or with a Parachute Adams.

821
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:24,351
A PT Nymph on the end,
and you could hook a big fish.

822
00:42:24,554 --> 00:42:26,419
Many think you have to go with...

823
00:42:26,622 --> 00:42:29,750
...a Woolly Bugger or Sculpin pattern
of some kind.

824
00:42:29,959 --> 00:42:34,862
Maybe Egg-Sucking Leech, which I've
never had any luck with myself.

825
00:42:35,064 --> 00:42:36,827
Is that L.L. Bean?

826
00:42:37,033 --> 00:42:38,432
-Is this L.L. Bean?
-This?

827
00:42:38,634 --> 00:42:39,623
Can I check?

828
00:42:39,836 --> 00:42:41,531
-I don't know.
-Oh, Hamilton.

829
00:42:41,737 --> 00:42:43,796
What? Just checking.

830
00:42:44,006 --> 00:42:47,237
Stefan, Stefan.
This is my "euphemism," Stefan.

831
00:42:47,443 --> 00:42:49,343
I want you to meet my new friends.

832
00:42:49,545 --> 00:42:52,241
-How are you, Gerry?
-Stefan.

833
00:42:52,448 --> 00:42:55,474
-Hello. You're Coo...?
-No, it's Cookie.

834
00:42:55,685 --> 00:42:57,550
It's Coo-Coo-Coo-Coo-Cookie!

835
00:42:57,753 --> 00:43:01,382
I was noticing your pants.
And then I noticed this.

836
00:43:01,591 --> 00:43:02,649
-Very funny.
-To death.

837
00:43:02,859 --> 00:43:05,623
Did he say his name's Mary,
as well as advertising it?

838
00:43:05,828 --> 00:43:10,390
-He was introduced as Mary, but--
-You know what? My name's not Mary.

839
00:43:10,933 --> 00:43:12,958
-It's Debbie!
-It's not. It's Debra!

840
00:43:13,169 --> 00:43:14,158
No, it's Scott.

841
00:43:14,370 --> 00:43:18,033
Do you have an appreciation for the
amount of work that went into these?

842
00:43:18,241 --> 00:43:20,766
-I ought to. I did it myself.
-Wow. Gee.

843
00:43:20,977 --> 00:43:23,775
It bored him to death.
I talked about it nonstop.

844
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:27,780
Well, that is six months
working with leather and red thread.

845
00:43:28,684 --> 00:43:31,414
-How much fun was he to be with?
-Heaven.

846
00:43:31,621 --> 00:43:33,885
-I make all this stuff.
-He's very talented.

847
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:37,617
-You must be very proud, Mary.
-"Proud Mary"!

848
00:43:37,827 --> 00:43:40,295
Oh, my goodness!
Who are you all of a sudden?

849
00:43:40,496 --> 00:43:43,727
-Good baby-boomer gag.
-Who are you in the burgundy jacket?

850
00:43:43,933 --> 00:43:45,924
-Good heavens!
-Mr. Hip!

851
00:44:03,619 --> 00:44:05,484
-Move your feet. Move.
-Gotcha.

852
00:44:05,688 --> 00:44:06,780
Stop it.

853
00:44:06,989 --> 00:44:09,457
-You're quick enough on the draw.
-I'll say.

854
00:44:09,659 --> 00:44:12,355
-Thank you, Mr. Handyman.
-Yes, sir.

855
00:44:12,562 --> 00:44:15,156
-Tanka up.
-Tanka.

856
00:44:18,367 --> 00:44:19,629
Hi, Terry?

857
00:44:19,835 --> 00:44:22,668
Hi. Yeah, we're here.
Where were you?

858
00:44:23,472 --> 00:44:25,963
So, how's everything?
Did he eat the pte?

859
00:44:26,175 --> 00:44:27,972
Did you put the vitamins in?

860
00:44:28,411 --> 00:44:31,869
Okay. Did he go poop?
Thank you.

861
00:44:32,081 --> 00:44:33,912
Too much information.

862
00:44:34,383 --> 00:44:37,318
Put him on.
I just want to say good night.

863
00:44:38,754 --> 00:44:41,814
Hi, Tyrone. Hi, it's Daddy.

864
00:44:42,024 --> 00:44:43,423
Hi, Tyrone. How are you?

865
00:44:43,626 --> 00:44:45,526
Say hello? Say hello, Aggie?

866
00:44:48,397 --> 00:44:50,297
I can hear him breathing.

867
00:44:50,499 --> 00:44:53,400
We'll be home tomorrow.
I wanted to say good night.

868
00:44:53,603 --> 00:44:56,436
I'm gonna sing a little bit
of your favorite song.

869
00:44:57,039 --> 00:45:01,567
They buried Barbara
ln the old churchyard

870
00:45:01,777 --> 00:45:05,178
They buried William beside her

871
00:45:05,681 --> 00:45:09,481
And from his grave
Grew a red, red rose

872
00:45:10,119 --> 00:45:13,555
And out ofhers a briar

873
00:45:14,857 --> 00:45:18,020
Good night. Don't stay up all night
watching old movies.

874
00:45:19,996 --> 00:45:25,093
Live From the Beyman Center
in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA

875
00:45:25,301 --> 00:45:30,398
It's the 125th Annual
Mayflower Kennel Club Dog Show

876
00:45:30,606 --> 00:45:33,939
Brought to you by lams Eukanuba

877
00:45:34,143 --> 00:45:38,671
And let me tell you, the City
ofBrotherly Love is aglow tonight

878
00:45:38,881 --> 00:45:43,045
Three thousand dogs competing
for Best in Show

879
00:45:43,252 --> 00:45:47,882
Some big and some are small.
Some really small.

880
00:45:48,090 --> 00:45:50,251
Bushy coats and coats so silky...

881
00:45:50,459 --> 00:45:53,553
...they look like they were spun
by a giant spider!

882
00:45:53,763 --> 00:45:55,958
You name it, they're here!

883
00:45:56,165 --> 00:45:59,134
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,
I'm Buck Laughlin.

884
00:45:59,335 --> 00:46:01,428
If you're a dog
or a friend of a dog...

885
00:46:01,637 --> 00:46:04,367
...you want to circle this night
in your TV Guide...

886
00:46:04,573 --> 00:46:07,633
...because, Trevor Beckwith,
they come to the Mayflower...

887
00:46:07,843 --> 00:46:10,641
...with their crates,
their kibble, and their cookies.

888
00:46:10,846 --> 00:46:13,110
And, most important,
with a will to win...

889
00:46:13,316 --> 00:46:16,615
...that only a fellow dog
can truly appreciate.

890
00:46:16,819 --> 00:46:18,480
Your thoughts on that matter?

891
00:46:18,688 --> 00:46:21,350
Buck, I can't speak for the animals,
of course...

892
00:46:21,557 --> 00:46:25,584
...but certainly, every human being in
this building is as excited as I am.

893
00:46:25,795 --> 00:46:29,891
-You wrote a book, didn't you?
-I did. I did. Follow the Lead.

894
00:46:30,099 --> 00:46:33,694
A book about obedience.
Basic obedience training for dogs.

895
00:46:33,903 --> 00:46:36,667
As you know, I have a franchise
of schools around--

896
00:46:36,872 --> 00:46:39,340
I didn't.
So this is right down your alley.

897
00:46:39,542 --> 00:46:41,737
I went to an obedience place once.

898
00:46:41,944 --> 00:46:46,278
It was going well till they spilled
hot candle wax on my private parts.

899
00:46:46,482 --> 00:46:49,042
I'm just kidding.
I know what you're saying.

900
00:46:52,555 --> 00:46:54,022
Because she's a winner.

901
00:46:54,223 --> 00:46:56,919
Because she is Miss America.

902
00:46:57,126 --> 00:46:58,718
You are little Miss America.

903
00:46:58,928 --> 00:47:00,395
I'm trying to groom her.

904
00:47:00,596 --> 00:47:02,894
She's fine. She's fine.
You know what?

905
00:47:03,099 --> 00:47:06,068
She's feeling chuffed.
Feeling full of herself.

906
00:47:06,268 --> 00:47:09,066
What I want her to do
is calm down a little bit.

907
00:47:09,271 --> 00:47:12,297
-Just don't do the front. Let me--
-Okay. Fine.

908
00:47:12,508 --> 00:47:14,840
What do you want more than anything?

909
00:47:15,044 --> 00:47:17,103
Do you want the big blue ribbon?

910
00:47:17,313 --> 00:47:18,507
Do you want red? No.

911
00:47:18,714 --> 00:47:20,079
Do you want yellow? No.

912
00:47:20,282 --> 00:47:21,442
You want the blue.

913
00:47:21,650 --> 00:47:23,379
What do you see in front of me?

914
00:47:23,586 --> 00:47:25,645
You see a blue ribbon
in front of you.

915
00:47:25,855 --> 00:47:27,413
You want it?
Grab it! Get it!

916
00:47:27,623 --> 00:47:29,818
She's not listening!
She's freaking out.

917
00:47:30,025 --> 00:47:32,255
Get the busy bee.
You want your busy bee?

918
00:47:32,461 --> 00:47:35,157
You get the busy bee.
I need to trim her whiskers.

919
00:47:35,364 --> 00:47:36,524
It's in the crate!

920
00:47:36,732 --> 00:47:37,790
It's in the crate!

921
00:47:38,267 --> 00:47:40,326
Why wasn't it out to begin with?

922
00:47:41,504 --> 00:47:42,903
Where in the crate?

923
00:47:43,572 --> 00:47:46,336
-It's not in here!
-It should be in the crate!

924
00:47:46,542 --> 00:47:48,510
It's not here!
I just told you that!

925
00:47:48,711 --> 00:47:52,272
God, Hamilton, if she doesn't get
her toy she's gonna flip out!

926
00:47:52,481 --> 00:47:54,346
See? It's not in here!

927
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:57,041
You left it at the hotel!
You go get it!

928
00:47:57,253 --> 00:47:59,813
Go to the hotel and get busy bee!

929
00:48:00,022 --> 00:48:02,456
Run! Run! Go!

930
00:48:02,658 --> 00:48:06,958
Mommy's getting the toy. Don't worry.
We just had a little discussion.

931
00:48:07,163 --> 00:48:09,256
Look at me.
Don't look at anybody else.

932
00:48:09,465 --> 00:48:13,128
Don't look at the fat-ass losers
or freaks! You look at me!

933
00:48:13,536 --> 00:48:16,630
-And what's the first category here?
-The Hound group.

934
00:48:16,839 --> 00:48:18,807
You have your finger on everything.

935
00:48:19,008 --> 00:48:23,342
The Hounds are coming out.
These are some unusual dogs.

936
00:48:25,448 --> 00:48:29,817
The Hound group can be divided
into two groups, sight and scent.

937
00:48:30,019 --> 00:48:34,046
This is the first of seven groups
that we'll see this evening...

938
00:48:34,256 --> 00:48:38,192
...as the dogs progress towards
the Best in Show title.

939
00:48:43,999 --> 00:48:47,594
-The judge is Eddie Franklin.
-That's Edie. Edie Franklin.

940
00:48:47,803 --> 00:48:50,795
-Edie?
-A retired teacher from New Jersey.

941
00:48:51,006 --> 00:48:52,667
You're right. That's a lady.

942
00:48:52,875 --> 00:48:56,902
She gives them a thorough going-over.
Are all judges that thorough?

943
00:48:57,112 --> 00:48:58,739
She looks at the teeth....

944
00:48:58,948 --> 00:49:01,712
It's important that
all attributes are examined.

945
00:49:01,917 --> 00:49:03,407
Teeth, eyes, ears, gums--

946
00:49:03,619 --> 00:49:06,520
Ouch! Do I see right?
Where's she putting her hand?

947
00:49:06,722 --> 00:49:10,488
Well, she's just checking out the
dog's testicular area to make sure...

948
00:49:10,693 --> 00:49:14,424
-Whoa.
-...that everything is intact.

949
00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:18,157
Hate to go out with Judge Edie
and have her judge me.

950
00:49:18,367 --> 00:49:19,800
That would be no fun.

951
00:49:20,002 --> 00:49:22,903
Would you take your dog down
and back for me, please?

952
00:49:25,708 --> 00:49:27,835
Now she's having the dogs--

953
00:49:28,043 --> 00:49:31,035
Why do they have them run away
and then back up?

954
00:49:31,247 --> 00:49:32,714
What are they looking for?

955
00:49:32,915 --> 00:49:36,908
For the dog's gait and movement,
to see the small angles.

956
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:40,350
So, Edie will be checking out
this thing in particular.

957
00:49:40,756 --> 00:49:42,348
Good way to judge a woman.

958
00:49:42,558 --> 00:49:44,617
Have her run away and then run back.

959
00:49:44,827 --> 00:49:47,352
You know, those "birds"
on Carnaby Street.

960
00:49:47,563 --> 00:49:51,590
I'm used to seeing them run away
more often than run towards me.

961
00:49:52,434 --> 00:49:55,164
Now what is that?
That's a Bloodhound, isn't it?

962
00:49:55,437 --> 00:49:57,166
Oh, this is a tremendous dog.

963
00:49:57,373 --> 00:50:01,673
I would say in two to three years,
this could be a champion dog.

964
00:50:01,877 --> 00:50:04,573
I think it may be
a tad immature for this year.

965
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:06,680
Trying to get some playing time.

966
00:50:06,882 --> 00:50:09,715
Take your dog down and back
for me, please?

967
00:50:11,854 --> 00:50:16,257
You know what would be funny? It's
just an idea off the top of my head.

968
00:50:16,458 --> 00:50:19,586
Why didn't he put
a Sherlock Holmes hat on it...

969
00:50:19,795 --> 00:50:21,490
...and put a pipe in his mouth?

970
00:50:21,697 --> 00:50:24,393
Are they allowed to dress up
a dog in a funny way?

971
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:27,194
No, that's not the purpose
of these shows.

972
00:50:27,403 --> 00:50:30,600
But it would really get
the crowd going, you know?

973
00:50:30,806 --> 00:50:32,603
-The hat with a pipe?
-Absolutely.

974
00:50:32,808 --> 00:50:35,470
You could make it look like
the pipe's smoking.

975
00:50:35,678 --> 00:50:37,908
I think that would be
a little dangerous.

976
00:50:38,113 --> 00:50:39,637
I'd get a kick out of it.

977
00:50:41,016 --> 00:50:46,044
Now, that looks like a fast dog.
Is that faster than a Greyhound?

978
00:50:46,255 --> 00:50:48,553
-Well--
-In a race, who would come in first?

979
00:50:48,757 --> 00:50:51,419
If you had a little jockey
on him, going--

980
00:50:51,627 --> 00:50:54,323
Let me ask, if you
put them on a football team...

981
00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:57,431
...which would be the wide receiver,
which one the tight end?

982
00:50:57,633 --> 00:51:00,067
Who can go the farthest, the fastest?

983
00:51:00,269 --> 00:51:02,533
I don't know any dogs
that play football.

984
00:51:02,938 --> 00:51:04,803
I'm having some fun with you.

985
00:51:06,375 --> 00:51:10,175
It's tension time. Who will she pick?
She's looking them over close.

986
00:51:10,379 --> 00:51:13,143
Yes, she's been very careful
with this group.

987
00:51:13,349 --> 00:51:16,250
Is there anything they can do now
to sway the judge?

988
00:51:16,452 --> 00:51:19,080
Nothing at all.
Just hope and pray at this point.

989
00:51:21,757 --> 00:51:26,353
-Bring the Bloodhound out, please.
-Oh, ho. That's a surprise.

990
00:51:27,062 --> 00:51:30,054
Bring the Beagle out, please.
Please sit down.

991
00:51:30,499 --> 00:51:31,864
The Borzoi, please.

992
00:51:39,775 --> 00:51:41,640
And the Petit, please.

993
00:51:42,645 --> 00:51:43,839
All right.

994
00:51:44,046 --> 00:51:47,072
Our little Sherlock Holmes dog
is out there, huh?

995
00:51:47,282 --> 00:51:49,216
Even without the hat and the pipe.

996
00:51:49,485 --> 00:51:51,385
So it's down to four now.

997
00:51:51,587 --> 00:51:54,351
She's taking a final look
at the four she's picked:

998
00:51:54,556 --> 00:51:59,016
The Bloodhound, the Beagle,
the Borzoi, and the PBGV.

999
00:51:59,228 --> 00:52:02,561
That's the way I want them!
One. Two.

1000
00:52:03,966 --> 00:52:05,729
Three. And four.

1001
00:52:05,934 --> 00:52:08,027
And that's it. That's the order.

1002
00:52:08,237 --> 00:52:09,966
Frankly, I'm very surprised.

1003
00:52:10,172 --> 00:52:13,869
-An upset. The rookie came through.
-It's definitely an upset.

1004
00:52:14,076 --> 00:52:16,169
That's a tremendous achievement.

1005
00:52:25,454 --> 00:52:27,354
Have you tried looking under the bed?

1006
00:52:27,556 --> 00:52:29,717
Of course I've looked under the bed!

1007
00:52:29,925 --> 00:52:32,325
That's where you look
when you lose things!

1008
00:52:35,731 --> 00:52:37,130
You! What's she here for?

1009
00:52:37,332 --> 00:52:40,301
I called you 30 minutes ago!
You call yourself a maid?

1010
00:52:40,936 --> 00:52:42,403
Where are you from?

1011
00:52:42,604 --> 00:52:45,129
-I know people at INS!
-I'm an American citizen.

1012
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:48,070
-They'll come in a van and take you...
-I'll handle it.

1013
00:52:48,277 --> 00:52:49,869
...back to where you came from!

1014
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:52,570
Who do you think you are?
I've spent 20 minutes--

1015
00:52:52,781 --> 00:52:56,182
-Go get your papers!
-You're too agitated over a dog's toy.

1016
00:52:56,385 --> 00:52:57,477
-A dog's toy?
-Yes.

1017
00:52:57,686 --> 00:53:01,315
You obviously don't know my dog!
Don't tell me--!

1018
00:53:01,523 --> 00:53:05,289
-There's a pet store right downstairs.
-A pet store down the stairs?!

1019
00:53:05,494 --> 00:53:07,394
-Yes.
-Are you a wizard?! A genius?!

1020
00:53:07,596 --> 00:53:09,257
Why didn't you tell me before?!

1021
00:53:09,465 --> 00:53:14,402
Thanks for your help,
you stupid hotel manager!

1022
00:53:17,005 --> 00:53:19,098
Yeah, see the coat?

1023
00:53:19,308 --> 00:53:21,936
I gotta tell you, I've never felt...

1024
00:53:22,144 --> 00:53:24,704
...more confident than I feel
right now.

1025
00:53:24,913 --> 00:53:27,905
Like I could say to the
president of the IKennel Club:

1026
00:53:28,117 --> 00:53:32,417
"Why don't we skip to the chase here,
and just give me the cup.

1027
00:53:32,621 --> 00:53:34,851
I'll be on my way.
You can take my photo."

1028
00:53:35,057 --> 00:53:37,719
I honestly feel that way.
But, you never know...

1029
00:53:37,926 --> 00:53:42,454
...because there's so many variables
that I just can't control.

1030
00:53:42,798 --> 00:53:45,289
But, everything's going as planned.

1031
00:53:46,201 --> 00:53:47,998
Except for the makeup.

1032
00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:51,298
Well, Sherri Ann did put
some makeup on me...

1033
00:53:51,507 --> 00:53:54,874
...but it's really not my style,
so I took it off.

1034
00:53:55,077 --> 00:53:57,011
-It looked good.
-It was a bit much.

1035
00:53:57,212 --> 00:54:00,045
No, it looked really good.
I did a wonderful...

1036
00:54:00,249 --> 00:54:04,242
...Sophia Loren Persian eye.

1037
00:54:04,453 --> 00:54:08,116
And it looked very dramatic,
and looked very showlike.

1038
00:54:08,323 --> 00:54:12,817
It was a little over the top.
I looked freakish, so I took it off.

1039
00:54:13,028 --> 00:54:16,691
-No, you didn't.
-You have to just let this go, okay?

1040
00:54:16,899 --> 00:54:20,733
But, I do like what she did
with my hair.

1041
00:54:23,038 --> 00:54:25,131
Well, now it's time for the toys.

1042
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:28,571
They're well-named.
They look like they could be wound up.

1043
00:54:28,777 --> 00:54:32,269
This is a fun group. And the crowd
always responds to the toys.

1044
00:54:32,481 --> 00:54:35,973
It's wonderful, the character
you see in these dogs.

1045
00:54:36,185 --> 00:54:39,211
That's what a lot of people
are looking for in a toy dog.

1046
00:54:39,421 --> 00:54:43,824
They're crowd pleasers. Frederick
Basil-Abbott Ill is the judge.

1047
00:54:44,026 --> 00:54:45,823
-He's got his hands full.
-Yes.

1048
00:54:48,096 --> 00:54:52,157
-Hey, hey, baby. Aw, a Bloodhound?
-Oh, yeah.

1049
00:54:52,367 --> 00:54:53,356
-Beautiful.
-Yep.

1050
00:54:53,569 --> 00:54:56,333
-Beautiful. How old is he?
-Yeah. He's 2.

1051
00:54:56,538 --> 00:54:59,166
-Slobbers a lot.
-He's a 2-year-old. Oh, yes.

1052
00:54:59,374 --> 00:55:03,435
-He's a 2-year. He's a slobberpuss.
-He is a slobberer. He's gorgeous.

1053
00:55:03,645 --> 00:55:05,840
-Yes, he is.
-Yeah.

1054
00:55:07,816 --> 00:55:09,750
I handle Rhapsody in White.

1055
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:15,920
-The Poodle, right? The Standard?
-Yeah. Two-time Best in Show.

1056
00:55:16,124 --> 00:55:18,558
-Last two years here at the Mayflower.
-That's--

1057
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:20,694
-I'm sure you know that.
-Yes.

1058
00:55:21,296 --> 00:55:23,161
-Yeah, so--
-I'm Harlan Pepper.

1059
00:55:23,365 --> 00:55:25,890
Christy Cummings.
But you probably know that.

1060
00:55:26,101 --> 00:55:27,966
Well, I do and I don't.

1061
00:55:30,272 --> 00:55:31,603
-You take care.
-I will.

1062
00:55:31,807 --> 00:55:33,707
Take care, Hubert. We'll see you.

1063
00:55:41,016 --> 00:55:43,007
The toy group
has long been a favorite.

1064
00:55:43,218 --> 00:55:45,243
Going back hundreds of years, when--

1065
00:55:45,454 --> 00:55:48,252
I'd be hard-pressed
to pick my favorite.

1066
00:55:48,457 --> 00:55:50,391
The Shih Tzu is a terrific dog.

1067
00:55:50,592 --> 00:55:52,219
-What's that one?
-The Shih Tzu.

1068
00:55:52,427 --> 00:55:54,520
-The Shih Tzu!
-That's a name you don't...

1069
00:55:54,730 --> 00:55:58,188
...play around with. It doesn't come
trippingly off the tongue.

1070
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:02,837
"Stewardess, can I take a Shih Tzu on,
or does it have to be stowed?"

1071
00:56:03,038 --> 00:56:06,166
-"Is that a Shih Tzu in your...?"
-An old joke, but still good.

1072
00:56:06,375 --> 00:56:08,275
It's a crowd pleaser.

1073
00:56:15,183 --> 00:56:18,084
Ma'am, can I have
the ltalian Greyhound over here?

1074
00:56:21,256 --> 00:56:24,453
-He's known as a deliberate judge.
-Is that right?

1075
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:26,787
Yes. An interesting side note:

1076
00:56:26,995 --> 00:56:31,227
He trained to be a priest at one time.
He was in a seminary.

1077
00:56:31,433 --> 00:56:34,197
Never went through with it all,
but it's unusual.

1078
00:56:34,403 --> 00:56:37,839
It'd be interesting to know why.
But that's a whole other show.

1079
00:56:38,307 --> 00:56:40,707
Sir, can I have the Pom
over here, please?

1080
00:56:46,048 --> 00:56:48,642
Ma'am, the Toy Poodle behind, please.

1081
00:56:53,956 --> 00:56:56,356
Sir, could I have
the Shih Tzu here, please?

1082
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:00,490
They are a playful bunch, aren't they?

1083
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,529
Thank you, sir. One.

1084
00:57:06,735 --> 00:57:09,602
Two. Three. Four.

1085
00:57:15,944 --> 00:57:18,003
Thank you. Oh, I'm sorry.

1086
00:57:18,213 --> 00:57:20,579
-Oh, congratulations.
-Thank you.

1087
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:23,283
My little princess.

1088
00:57:23,485 --> 00:57:24,850
-My hero.
-Oh, thanks.

1089
00:57:25,053 --> 00:57:26,918
-God, thank you.
-Good job.

1090
00:57:27,289 --> 00:57:29,018
-Thanks.
-The Pom was no problem?

1091
00:57:29,224 --> 00:57:32,489
Pom broke his gait.
He might as well have taken a dump.

1092
00:57:32,694 --> 00:57:34,992
I was amazed the Yorkie
didn't do better.

1093
00:57:35,197 --> 00:57:37,722
-Who knew?
-Look at this. It's all you.

1094
00:57:37,933 --> 00:57:40,527
First in group.
Best in Show coming up.

1095
00:57:40,736 --> 00:57:43,261
She's like, "Group, shmoop.
Bring it on."

1096
00:57:43,472 --> 00:57:45,804
Which reminds me,
gotta go to the hotel.

1097
00:57:46,008 --> 00:57:47,737
-I have to change.
-Want some soup?

1098
00:57:47,943 --> 00:57:49,035
-Bath balm.
-Bath balm.

1099
00:57:49,244 --> 00:57:50,233
Immediately.

1100
00:57:53,515 --> 00:57:57,679
-Hello.
-Hi. I'm looking for a toy.

1101
00:57:57,886 --> 00:58:01,219
-It's a bumble bee. It's like a--
-For what kind of animal?

1102
00:58:01,423 --> 00:58:04,051
For a dog. It's a bee.
It's a bumble bee.

1103
00:58:04,259 --> 00:58:06,693
And it's furry.
It's about this big.

1104
00:58:06,895 --> 00:58:08,658
-Okay.
-Right.

1105
00:58:08,864 --> 00:58:11,264
It's a bumble bee.

1106
00:58:11,466 --> 00:58:12,933
Stripes on it.

1107
00:58:13,135 --> 00:58:17,196
-Here it is. Is this it?
-No, that's a bear in a bee costume.

1108
00:58:17,406 --> 00:58:19,465
Okay. I'm just trying to help.

1109
00:58:19,674 --> 00:58:23,110
It's about this big.
And it squeaks in the middle.

1110
00:58:23,311 --> 00:58:26,747
Oh. Okay.
This one squeaks. You know?

1111
00:58:26,982 --> 00:58:28,950
And I think it's striped.

1112
00:58:29,151 --> 00:58:31,642
I think the dog
will respond to the stripes.

1113
00:58:31,853 --> 00:58:35,289
And it's reminiscent
of a bumble bee, I think.

1114
00:58:35,490 --> 00:58:37,355
-It's like a bee.
-That's a parrot.

1115
00:58:37,559 --> 00:58:39,754
That's what the dog's responding to.

1116
00:58:39,961 --> 00:58:43,055
But you can look in the box here.
We have more.

1117
00:58:43,265 --> 00:58:45,961
Like this one.
The yellow and black one there?

1118
00:58:46,168 --> 00:58:47,897
-This?
-That's like a bee.

1119
00:58:48,103 --> 00:58:51,129
-This is a fish.
-Well, we know that's a fish...

1120
00:58:51,339 --> 00:58:53,068
-...but to a dog--
-Just shut up.

1121
00:58:53,275 --> 00:58:55,766
-I'm gonna get this.
-I'm just trying to help.

1122
00:58:55,977 --> 00:58:57,069
Thank you.

1123
00:58:57,279 --> 00:58:59,839
This is least like a bee
of what we have.

1124
00:59:00,048 --> 00:59:04,314
I didn't ask for your opinion.
I asked for a toy that you don't have!

1125
00:59:05,487 --> 00:59:07,148
-Oh, baby, you're so good.
-Yes.

1126
00:59:07,355 --> 00:59:08,652
Look at you.

1127
00:59:09,357 --> 00:59:13,691
Who could look at this face and say,
"Oh, I want him."

1128
00:59:13,895 --> 00:59:16,295
You. Hey, Wink. Hey, Wink.

1129
00:59:16,498 --> 00:59:18,898
-Look at this.
-Did you see the scary dog?

1130
00:59:19,101 --> 00:59:22,696
You. Hey, Winky, look at this.

1131
00:59:22,904 --> 00:59:25,395
You! Yes.

1132
00:59:25,607 --> 00:59:28,269
He's just a natural.
And look at his face.

1133
00:59:28,477 --> 00:59:31,310
Could he be sweeter or more loving?

1134
00:59:31,847 --> 00:59:35,044
The group is all about attitude.
And look at this.

1135
00:59:35,584 --> 00:59:38,144
What, could you find
a more likable attitude?

1136
00:59:38,353 --> 00:59:41,288
A happier, happier-to-know-you
kind of attitude?

1137
00:59:41,957 --> 00:59:43,822
I'm talking about you.

1138
00:59:44,993 --> 00:59:47,052
And here come the Terriers!

1139
00:59:47,262 --> 00:59:49,025
This is a very popular group.

1140
00:59:49,231 --> 00:59:54,168
There's a lot of winners that have
come out of this group in past shows.

1141
00:59:54,369 --> 00:59:57,429
-It's also popular with the crowd.
-They're lovable dogs.

1142
00:59:57,639 --> 01:00:01,666
-Wonderful personality.
-Very frisky, very playful.

1143
01:00:01,877 --> 01:00:04,675
It's sad, when you look at
how beautiful they are...

1144
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:08,179
...to think that in some countries,
these dogs are eaten.

1145
01:00:09,751 --> 01:00:11,218
And once around, please.

1146
01:00:11,419 --> 01:00:13,649
That's my favorite,
the Miniature Schnauzer.

1147
01:00:13,855 --> 01:00:15,516
How do they make them miniature?

1148
01:00:15,724 --> 01:00:19,023
Is there some way, some process
they physically...

1149
01:00:19,227 --> 01:00:21,787
...miniaturize the dog?
Or is it a puppy?

1150
01:00:21,997 --> 01:00:23,396
What the devil is going on?

1151
01:00:23,598 --> 01:00:25,395
They just.... It's breeding.

1152
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:27,192
They breed them small.

1153
01:00:27,402 --> 01:00:31,566
You'd think they'd want them bigger,
like grapefruits or watermelons.

1154
01:00:32,541 --> 01:00:34,702
Now, what's that up on the table?

1155
01:00:34,910 --> 01:00:36,434
That's the Norwich.

1156
01:00:37,179 --> 01:00:40,046
She's taking a close look
at the Norwich.

1157
01:00:40,482 --> 01:00:41,949
That handler looks familiar to me.

1158
01:00:42,150 --> 01:00:44,983
Madam, could you bring the dog
further down in back, please?

1159
01:00:48,557 --> 01:00:50,081
That's my dog.

1160
01:00:52,627 --> 01:00:55,221
Did I mention my idea for a book
for you?

1161
01:00:55,430 --> 01:00:58,888
Women bathing their dogs.
In cutoff jeans and T-shirts...

1162
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:00,397
...and with the soap.

1163
01:01:00,602 --> 01:01:04,538
How it gets all wet, then the water,
let your imagination run wild.

1164
01:01:04,739 --> 01:01:07,401
Get the IKennel Club
behind it, make a few bucks.

1165
01:01:07,609 --> 01:01:10,077
That's what it's all about.
Put your name on it.

1166
01:01:10,879 --> 01:01:13,439
Bathing Your Dog
With Trevor Beckwith.

1167
01:01:13,648 --> 01:01:17,209
Doing It Doggy Style. You come up
with that, I'm not the literary guy.

1168
01:01:20,689 --> 01:01:24,352
All right. Judge Ruth Collier
is looking very closely.

1169
01:01:26,628 --> 01:01:27,458
One.

1170
01:01:27,963 --> 01:01:29,430
Two.

1171
01:01:29,998 --> 01:01:32,023
Three. Four.

1172
01:01:34,669 --> 01:01:36,227
Thank you.

1173
01:01:38,406 --> 01:01:39,430
Here.

1174
01:01:40,742 --> 01:01:42,039
What the hell is this?

1175
01:01:42,244 --> 01:01:44,439
-It's a toy.
-It's a rooster or something.

1176
01:01:44,646 --> 01:01:46,511
Get out the bee. Where's the bee?

1177
01:01:46,715 --> 01:01:49,707
I couldn't find it.
I went to the hotel, I asked.

1178
01:01:49,918 --> 01:01:53,376
You were gone for a half-hour and
you came back with this purple thing?!

1179
01:01:53,588 --> 01:01:54,850
Don't spit at me!

1180
01:01:55,056 --> 01:01:56,956
Don't you yell at me!

1181
01:01:57,259 --> 01:01:58,624
You take care of it!

1182
01:01:58,827 --> 01:02:01,387
-I will take care of it!
-Stop it! Just....

1183
01:02:02,430 --> 01:02:05,991
We're here with Dr. Millbank,
President of the Mayflower IKennel Club.

1184
01:02:06,768 --> 01:02:10,067
Doctor, let me ask you something.
I got a little bursitis in my shoulder.

1185
01:02:10,272 --> 01:02:12,035
Do you recommend heat or cold?

1186
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,606
-I'm not that kind of doctor.
-I know that.

1187
01:02:14,809 --> 01:02:17,175
I'm just kidding. He's not
that kind of doctor...

1188
01:02:17,379 --> 01:02:20,473
...but he's got such a good sense of
humor, we like to have a few laughs.

1189
01:02:20,682 --> 01:02:23,207
Question that's always bothered me
and a lot of people:

1190
01:02:23,418 --> 01:02:27,650
Mayflower, combined with Philadelphia,
no-brainer, right?

1191
01:02:27,856 --> 01:02:29,756
Because this is where
the Mayflower landed.

1192
01:02:29,958 --> 01:02:33,689
Not so, it turns out Columbus actually
set foot somewhere in the West lndies.

1193
01:02:33,895 --> 01:02:34,919
Little-known fact.

1194
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:37,621
How does the name Mayflower get up
to the Quaker City?

1195
01:02:37,932 --> 01:02:41,834
It wasn't actually Columbus on the
Mayflower, as you probably remember.

1196
01:02:42,037 --> 01:02:44,062
And he did land in Plymouth Rock,
Massachusetts.

1197
01:02:44,272 --> 01:02:46,638
They landed in several places,
because there's the Nina...

1198
01:02:46,841 --> 01:02:48,604
-...the Pnta, a couple of them....
-And the Santa Maria.

1199
01:02:48,810 --> 01:02:51,608
-They all landed in different places.
-Not really.

1200
01:02:51,813 --> 01:02:53,280
Well, I'm not the historian.

1201
01:02:53,481 --> 01:02:55,540
Let the production people deal
with that one.

1202
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:56,876
Right. It doesn't matter.

1203
01:03:02,924 --> 01:03:06,121
So these are the sporting dogs.
These are the athletes.

1204
01:03:06,328 --> 01:03:09,058
These are the jocks of the dog world,
wouldn't you say?

1205
01:03:09,264 --> 01:03:11,425
These are the dogs that
you'll often see...

1206
01:03:11,633 --> 01:03:14,796
...hanging on the wall in museums
and classic paintings.

1207
01:03:15,303 --> 01:03:17,168
This group is actually known as...

1208
01:03:17,372 --> 01:03:20,466
...the Hunting Group
in the United IKingdom.

1209
01:03:20,875 --> 01:03:24,208
And the judge is Judge Freda Dunlop.

1210
01:03:24,713 --> 01:03:27,580
She is also very, very slow...

1211
01:03:27,782 --> 01:03:30,148
-...and determined.
-Very deliberate.

1212
01:03:30,652 --> 01:03:33,314
Now, we're seeing the Weimaraner,
a wonderful dog.

1213
01:03:33,788 --> 01:03:35,153
That's a beauty.

1214
01:03:35,357 --> 01:03:37,552
That's "The Grey Ghost."

1215
01:03:39,394 --> 01:03:40,861
Oh, I'm sorry. Get down.

1216
01:03:41,062 --> 01:03:42,723
Please control your dog.

1217
01:03:42,931 --> 01:03:44,364
That's not a good start.

1218
01:03:44,566 --> 01:03:46,056
Right around here. Let's try again.

1219
01:03:46,267 --> 01:03:48,235
This has never happened before, ever.

1220
01:03:48,603 --> 01:03:51,572
I'm sorry. We're dismissing you.

1221
01:03:51,773 --> 01:03:53,707
Just give us another chance.

1222
01:03:53,908 --> 01:03:56,706
-I'm sorry. We're dismissing you.
-No, let me just try again.

1223
01:03:56,911 --> 01:03:57,935
This does not look good.

1224
01:03:58,146 --> 01:04:00,341
He went after her like
she's made out of ham.

1225
01:04:00,582 --> 01:04:04,040
And I guess he's getting
the old heave-ho.

1226
01:04:04,452 --> 01:04:06,977
-The dog has been excused.
-She is gone.

1227
01:04:07,188 --> 01:04:09,019
Just get away from me,
you goddamn asshole!

1228
01:04:09,224 --> 01:04:11,385
-It's a shame to see that happen.
-Beautiful dog.

1229
01:04:11,593 --> 01:04:13,185
-But he's still a champion.
-Oh, yes.

1230
01:04:13,395 --> 01:04:16,296
Even though he leaves in disgrace.
Like "Shoeless Joe" Jackson.

1231
01:04:16,498 --> 01:04:19,626
He's out of the leagues, but we still
talk about him today.

1232
01:04:20,568 --> 01:04:22,763
Hi. I'd like...

1233
01:04:23,838 --> 01:04:28,104
...an extra-large bucket of popcorn,
half-butter, half-salt.

1234
01:04:28,309 --> 01:04:31,745
I wouldn't normally
just be out here...

1235
01:04:32,213 --> 01:04:34,010
...pigging out.

1236
01:04:34,215 --> 01:04:35,273
But...

1237
01:04:36,684 --> 01:04:40,711
...l'm a little nervous right now.
There's a lot at stake.

1238
01:04:41,356 --> 01:04:44,553
You know, we've had two wins.
This would be our third...

1239
01:04:44,759 --> 01:04:47,728
...and I'm making Leslie nervous.

1240
01:04:47,929 --> 01:04:50,056
I'm making myself very nervous.

1241
01:04:50,265 --> 01:04:54,133
And my nervousness is...

1242
01:04:54,402 --> 01:04:57,997
...is rubbing off on Leslie. And....

1243
01:05:00,575 --> 01:05:02,668
I feel like l...

1244
01:05:03,178 --> 01:05:06,147
...l just really need to listen
to my inner instinct...

1245
01:05:06,347 --> 01:05:09,714
...and my inner instinct says...

1246
01:05:10,151 --> 01:05:12,176
..."Don't go right now."

1247
01:05:13,688 --> 01:05:15,383
So, I'm not going out.

1248
01:05:15,590 --> 01:05:19,082
I'm gonna be right here until
I get another message...

1249
01:05:19,294 --> 01:05:20,852
...from myself.

1250
01:05:27,702 --> 01:05:28,726
What are you doing, honey?

1251
01:05:28,937 --> 01:05:31,633
They're just finishing up
the Non-sporting in a second.

1252
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:34,138
I'm looking for the hand cream.
Did you bring it?

1253
01:05:34,342 --> 01:05:37,277
I've got a lot of hand cream.
But I don't have the....

1254
01:05:37,479 --> 01:05:39,879
God, look at that IKeeshond.

1255
01:05:40,482 --> 01:05:41,710
Is that hideous?

1256
01:05:41,916 --> 01:05:43,884
What's that doing at the Mayflower?

1257
01:05:45,019 --> 01:05:48,682
Oh, my goodness.
You might want to see this.

1258
01:05:49,591 --> 01:05:51,422
It's Miss Cummings.

1259
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:54,621
Is it ever Miss Cummings.

1260
01:05:54,829 --> 01:05:55,921
Oh, my God.

1261
01:05:56,130 --> 01:05:57,893
Bob Mackie, where are you
when we need you?

1262
01:05:58,099 --> 01:06:00,932
She looks like a cocktail waitress
on an oil rig.

1263
01:06:01,135 --> 01:06:03,865
Doesn't--? Look at the piping.

1264
01:06:04,072 --> 01:06:06,973
She tries to be so self-possessed,
but look at the terror in her face.

1265
01:06:07,175 --> 01:06:09,370
It's all about fear for her.

1266
01:06:09,577 --> 01:06:11,135
Well, it's all about her.

1267
01:06:14,215 --> 01:06:15,842
He's taking his time picking.

1268
01:06:16,184 --> 01:06:17,845
That's for sure.

1269
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:21,079
And stopping them once again.

1270
01:06:21,589 --> 01:06:23,819
He is a highly respected judge.

1271
01:06:24,025 --> 01:06:26,357
Often tends to go on personality.

1272
01:06:26,561 --> 01:06:29,496
And we've certainly got a lot of
personality in this selection.

1273
01:06:29,697 --> 01:06:31,995
You're number one. Two.

1274
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:34,828
Three. And four.

1275
01:06:39,574 --> 01:06:42,907
Yeah. Look at that Poodle.
She knows she's a winner.

1276
01:06:43,111 --> 01:06:45,375
And look at her handler.
That is one happy fella.

1277
01:06:45,580 --> 01:06:47,514
That is actually a woman.

1278
01:06:47,715 --> 01:06:51,082
A woman-- Iady handler.
They are sharing thejoy.

1279
01:06:51,286 --> 01:06:54,619
And this is interesting,
do you think they can feel thejoy?

1280
01:06:55,023 --> 01:06:56,183
-Okay.
-Big surprise.

1281
01:06:56,391 --> 01:06:58,552
There it is.
I better show Agnes this bitch.

1282
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:00,694
Oh, God. When she smiles....

1283
01:07:00,895 --> 01:07:04,331
Stop eating that shirt and look
at your competition.

1284
01:07:04,532 --> 01:07:06,864
That is Rhapsody in White.

1285
01:07:07,068 --> 01:07:09,468
That's who you're gonna beat.

1286
01:07:09,737 --> 01:07:12,035
-She wins in a waltz, don't you?
-She does.

1287
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:14,765
Christy's gonna go talk to Sherri Ann.

1288
01:07:14,976 --> 01:07:17,877
Here's Sherri Ann.
What is Sherri Ann wearing?

1289
01:07:19,814 --> 01:07:21,111
And she--

1290
01:07:24,819 --> 01:07:26,150
Hello?

1291
01:07:28,222 --> 01:07:30,247
Rhapsody has two mommies.

1292
01:07:32,126 --> 01:07:34,788
All right, Trevor Beckwith,
it all comes down to this.

1293
01:07:34,996 --> 01:07:38,159
They're going for all the marbles.
The Best in Show.

1294
01:07:38,366 --> 01:07:39,856
The final seven.

1295
01:07:40,068 --> 01:07:41,763
It's the bottom of the ninth inning.

1296
01:07:41,970 --> 01:07:43,767
It's the goal line stand.

1297
01:07:43,972 --> 01:07:45,735
It's the final round.

1298
01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:50,343
And after all the grooming, the
petting, the kibbles, the liver snaps.

1299
01:07:50,678 --> 01:07:52,509
Your opinion. Your feedback.

1300
01:07:52,714 --> 01:07:55,979
This is a very exciting moment.
All these are wonderful dogs.

1301
01:07:56,184 --> 01:07:58,209
And this is the moment everybody's
been waiting for.

1302
01:07:58,419 --> 01:08:00,853
The last seven. The best of the best.

1303
01:08:01,055 --> 01:08:03,023
-This is a great moment.
-Creme de la creme.

1304
01:08:03,224 --> 01:08:05,021
-As long as you're calm.
-I do. I am.

1305
01:08:05,226 --> 01:08:07,786
Because I'm as calm as a cucumber,
okay?

1306
01:08:07,996 --> 01:08:09,429
Why don't you sit down?

1307
01:08:09,631 --> 01:08:12,225
-Go sit down.
-I'm kidding. I'm nervous.

1308
01:08:12,433 --> 01:08:15,891
So sit down now because Winky and I
have to get ready for the show.

1309
01:08:16,104 --> 01:08:17,196
IKnock them dead, honey.

1310
01:08:17,572 --> 01:08:18,800
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

1311
01:08:19,007 --> 01:08:20,474
-Good luck.
-"Bye-bye, Daddy."

1312
01:08:20,675 --> 01:08:23,269
Say, "Bye-bye, Daddy." Bye, darling.

1313
01:08:23,478 --> 01:08:24,672
Sweetheart?

1314
01:08:25,079 --> 01:08:27,206
-Make Fern City proud, okay?
-I will.

1315
01:08:30,518 --> 01:08:32,110
-What the--?
-Are you all right?

1316
01:08:33,988 --> 01:08:37,219
What'd I trip on? Did somebody put
something here so I'd trip?

1317
01:08:37,425 --> 01:08:39,484
-Calm down.
-Why did you fall?

1318
01:08:39,694 --> 01:08:41,924
Okay, it's just my knee. I'm fine.

1319
01:08:42,130 --> 01:08:44,496
Look out. You're gonna
step on your dog.

1320
01:08:44,699 --> 01:08:48,465
-Oh, no. Your knee is all messed up.
-We need a doctor.

1321
01:08:48,670 --> 01:08:50,604
Is there--? Can we get a medic?

1322
01:08:50,805 --> 01:08:52,067
It's Best ln Show.

1323
01:08:52,273 --> 01:08:55,606
Your knee is ballooning up
like a watermelon, sweetheart.

1324
01:08:56,177 --> 01:08:58,941
Baby, you can't miss this.
Winky can't miss this.

1325
01:08:59,147 --> 01:09:02,139
He's worked for two and a half years.
He can't miss this.

1326
01:09:02,350 --> 01:09:03,408
-He can't miss?
-He can't miss it.

1327
01:09:03,618 --> 01:09:05,882
-Then we get a handler.
-A handler?

1328
01:09:06,087 --> 01:09:09,022
-We get a professional handler.
-A stranger?

1329
01:09:09,223 --> 01:09:11,851
If you want the dog in the show,
we need a handler.

1330
01:09:12,060 --> 01:09:13,960
You have to do it. You have to.

1331
01:09:14,162 --> 01:09:17,256
You have a concussion.
You're not making any sense.

1332
01:09:17,465 --> 01:09:19,296
All you have to do is follow him.

1333
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:21,229
Just follow him.

1334
01:09:21,436 --> 01:09:23,563
-We'll take care of you.
-You'll be fine.

1335
01:09:23,771 --> 01:09:24,999
I've walked him--

1336
01:09:25,206 --> 01:09:28,266
You take him for a walk every night.
That's gaiting.

1337
01:09:28,476 --> 01:09:31,468
I don't even know what gaiting is.
What's this?

1338
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:35,410
Your number, keep it on your left arm.
IKeep the dog on the left too.

1339
01:09:35,950 --> 01:09:36,780
Gerry...

1340
01:09:37,618 --> 01:09:39,381
...you're gonna show Winky.

1341
01:09:43,491 --> 01:09:45,891
And here they come! The Pointer....

1342
01:09:46,094 --> 01:09:48,654
The Pointer from the Sporting Group,
handled by Jill IKoch.

1343
01:09:48,863 --> 01:09:51,696
And look at that magnificent dog.

1344
01:09:51,899 --> 01:09:53,230
Absolutely beautiful.

1345
01:09:53,434 --> 01:09:56,369
Do you think they know
the championship's on the line here?

1346
01:09:56,571 --> 01:09:58,539
I think they know
they're very special dogs...

1347
01:09:58,740 --> 01:10:00,640
...and that they're still in it.

1348
01:10:01,342 --> 01:10:02,434
And the Bloodhound....

1349
01:10:02,643 --> 01:10:05,476
-Picking up the track of the Pointer.
-Beautiful dog.

1350
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:07,113
Hubert.

1351
01:10:07,315 --> 01:10:10,250
I was talking to his owner
and handler, Harlan Pepper...

1352
01:10:10,451 --> 01:10:14,114
...and he believes this dog has
a tremendous future.

1353
01:10:14,889 --> 01:10:18,689
And here's the Siberian Husky,
handled by Joanne Dixon.

1354
01:10:18,893 --> 01:10:21,191
-Also a beautiful dog.
-Magnificent, yes.

1355
01:10:21,395 --> 01:10:24,125
And they're strutting their stuff
too.

1356
01:10:29,070 --> 01:10:32,369
The Terrier group now.
This is the Norwich Terrier.

1357
01:10:32,707 --> 01:10:33,969
With....

1358
01:10:35,443 --> 01:10:38,901
-Seems to have a different handler.
-It's not Cookie Fleck.

1359
01:10:39,881 --> 01:10:42,941
We're getting word that
the dog is being handled by...

1360
01:10:43,384 --> 01:10:45,682
...Cookie's husband, Gerry Fleck.

1361
01:10:45,887 --> 01:10:47,855
-Very unusual.
-Boy, this is thrilling.

1362
01:10:48,055 --> 01:10:50,580
The bottom of the ninth,
a pinch hitter comes in.

1363
01:10:51,359 --> 01:10:53,327
Am I nuts or--?

1364
01:10:53,661 --> 01:10:55,993
Something's wrong with his feet.

1365
01:10:56,564 --> 01:11:00,295
I don't think I ever find myself
saying this, but I think...

1366
01:11:00,501 --> 01:11:02,992
-...you're right.
-He's got two left feet.

1367
01:11:03,204 --> 01:11:04,535
That is certainly a first.

1368
01:11:04,739 --> 01:11:06,832
Go get 'em, pal! Man!

1369
01:11:07,809 --> 01:11:11,472
And the Toy Group, the Shih Tzu
is here with Scott Donlan...

1370
01:11:11,679 --> 01:11:14,807
-...in a splendid outfit.
-Scott is prancing along...

1371
01:11:15,016 --> 01:11:17,143
...with the dog.
And look at his outfit.

1372
01:11:17,351 --> 01:11:20,047
In my neighborhood,
you wear an outfit like that...

1373
01:11:20,254 --> 01:11:22,950
...you better be a hotel doorman.

1374
01:11:23,157 --> 01:11:25,887
-He is having fun with his dog.
-Here's Rhapsody...

1375
01:11:26,294 --> 01:11:27,693
-That's your favorite.
-...with Christy.

1376
01:11:27,895 --> 01:11:30,227
And the crowd's reacting too.

1377
01:11:30,431 --> 01:11:34,527
This dog is as close to perfect as I
think you'll see. And she knows it.

1378
01:11:34,735 --> 01:11:37,329
-She knows this.
-She has a winner's attitude.

1379
01:11:37,638 --> 01:11:39,833
And last, lastly we have the...

1380
01:11:40,041 --> 01:11:42,805
...the Shetland Sheepdog.
The dog I have.

1381
01:11:43,010 --> 01:11:44,500
The Sheltie.

1382
01:11:45,213 --> 01:11:48,239
Let me ask you.
This may be a little bit off the path.

1383
01:11:48,449 --> 01:11:51,179
How much weight do you think
I could bench press?

1384
01:11:51,752 --> 01:11:54,516
Just make a guess.
A ballpark figure.

1385
01:11:54,722 --> 01:11:57,885
31 5 pounds.
I was in top shape.

1386
01:11:58,092 --> 01:12:00,822
I don't know if I could make it
back and forth here.

1387
01:12:01,028 --> 01:12:03,656
-Quite impressive.
-Dead-lifted over 500.

1388
01:12:04,966 --> 01:12:08,493
-I think we're all set to go here.
-Oh, boy. Oh, boy!

1389
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:10,330
Bring out the Pointer, please.

1390
01:12:11,772 --> 01:12:15,970
And the judge is Everett Bainbridge,
if I'm not wrong.

1391
01:12:16,177 --> 01:12:18,873
Yes, Everett is a very
experienced judge.

1392
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:21,640
-I would hope so.
-We're in very good hands.

1393
01:12:21,849 --> 01:12:24,909
This is like the World Series.
You get the best umpires.

1394
01:12:25,553 --> 01:12:27,043
Once around, please.

1395
01:12:31,125 --> 01:12:32,717
Bring out the Bloodhound.

1396
01:12:42,803 --> 01:12:43,963
Once around, please.

1397
01:12:48,576 --> 01:12:51,477
Can a dog win it or lose it
in this last round...

1398
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:53,340
...or has the judge made up his mind?

1399
01:12:53,547 --> 01:12:55,378
Oh, good heavens, no. This is...

1400
01:12:55,583 --> 01:12:57,175
...still open at this point.

1401
01:12:57,385 --> 01:12:59,876
It's apples and oranges,
different breeds.

1402
01:13:00,087 --> 01:13:02,282
Are they looking for
something particular?

1403
01:13:02,490 --> 01:13:04,924
It's a gut reaction on some level.
These are all...

1404
01:13:05,126 --> 01:13:08,152
-...superb animals.
-Very subjective, then.

1405
01:13:08,362 --> 01:13:09,852
Very difficult task to pick.

1406
01:13:10,064 --> 01:13:13,431
Let me ask you, does money ever
exchange hands under the table?

1407
01:13:13,634 --> 01:13:15,966
-Good Lord, no.
-Don't stick your neck out.

1408
01:13:16,170 --> 01:13:18,434
I'd be tempted to lay a few dollars.

1409
01:13:32,119 --> 01:13:33,882
Once around, please.

1410
01:13:41,796 --> 01:13:43,923
They're just one cuter than the other.

1411
01:13:44,131 --> 01:13:46,429
And I think everybody
responds to that.

1412
01:13:46,634 --> 01:13:48,158
Bring out the Shih Tzu, please.

1413
01:14:05,186 --> 01:14:07,677
I couldn't get used
to being probed and prodded.

1414
01:14:07,888 --> 01:14:09,822
I told my proctologist once:

1415
01:14:10,024 --> 01:14:12,788
"Why don't you take me out
to dinner and a movie sometime?"

1416
01:14:12,994 --> 01:14:15,724
Yes. I remember you said that
last year.

1417
01:14:16,230 --> 01:14:17,788
Once around, please.

1418
01:14:28,476 --> 01:14:30,967
Bring out the standard Poodle, please!

1419
01:14:42,423 --> 01:14:44,687
This may seem like a silly question.

1420
01:14:44,892 --> 01:14:47,360
If you get a French dog,
a Chinese dog, a German dog...

1421
01:14:47,561 --> 01:14:50,860
...do they all bark the same?
They all sound the same....

1422
01:14:51,065 --> 01:14:52,623
Or is it a different language?

1423
01:14:52,833 --> 01:14:55,597
Different dogs have different
intonations and tones.

1424
01:14:55,803 --> 01:14:58,931
The country, the boundaries,
doesn't make any difference?

1425
01:15:04,545 --> 01:15:07,275
Bring out the Shetland Sheepdog,
please.

1426
01:15:09,850 --> 01:15:12,683
I notice in these competitions
they don't do the basic...

1427
01:15:12,887 --> 01:15:15,412
..."sit up," "roll over,"
"fetch," "heel."

1428
01:15:15,623 --> 01:15:19,024
They start at a higher level than that,
don't they?

1429
01:15:19,226 --> 01:15:20,784
Those are the basic commands--

1430
01:15:20,995 --> 01:15:24,863
And is that taken into consideration
at the start, or, I mean...

1431
01:15:25,066 --> 01:15:29,002
...are you just judging by how well
a dog is groomed?

1432
01:15:29,870 --> 01:15:31,201
Once around.

1433
01:15:33,441 --> 01:15:35,909
These dogs are pampered and petted...

1434
01:15:36,110 --> 01:15:38,340
...and all in top physical condition.

1435
01:15:38,546 --> 01:15:41,037
No question. This is the prime.

1436
01:15:41,248 --> 01:15:44,240
You won't see finer specimens
than these seven dogs.

1437
01:15:44,452 --> 01:15:47,216
It's a shame, really,
that there has to be one picked.

1438
01:15:47,421 --> 01:15:49,116
Because as we've said
time and time again...

1439
01:15:49,323 --> 01:15:52,053
...these aren't just winners.
These are winners within winners.

1440
01:15:56,730 --> 01:16:01,224
And Mr. Bainbridge is taking a very,
very close look at these dogs.

1441
01:16:01,435 --> 01:16:05,235
I don't envy him this task.
He's a master of...

1442
01:16:05,439 --> 01:16:08,101
...1 50 breeds.

1443
01:16:08,309 --> 01:16:10,243
And this well-informed judge....

1444
01:16:10,444 --> 01:16:11,934
This is a terribly difficult task.

1445
01:16:12,146 --> 01:16:15,946
Like the umpire calling a close play
at home plate in the bottom of the 9th.

1446
01:16:16,150 --> 01:16:17,981
I wouldn't want to be in his shoes.

1447
01:16:20,020 --> 01:16:23,649
The judge is going over to the judges'
table to sign the book.

1448
01:16:23,858 --> 01:16:26,122
-So he's made his decision.
-We have a winner.

1449
01:16:27,228 --> 01:16:29,025
Lot of hearts in dogs' throats.

1450
01:16:29,230 --> 01:16:30,788
Do dogs react to this?

1451
01:16:30,998 --> 01:16:33,558
They sense the tension. They have to.

1452
01:16:33,767 --> 01:16:35,132
They can't not.

1453
01:16:35,336 --> 01:16:38,567
And here comes the cup, with Doctor
Millbank and Graham Chissolm.

1454
01:16:38,772 --> 01:16:42,765
Look at the size of that. I've taken
sponge baths in smaller bowls.

1455
01:16:42,977 --> 01:16:47,676
This really is the defining moment
of this competition.

1456
01:16:58,726 --> 01:17:00,125
The Norwich Terrier!

1457
01:17:08,569 --> 01:17:10,799
Congratulations, you did a great job.

1458
01:17:14,008 --> 01:17:15,703
Thank you. Thanks.

1459
01:17:25,753 --> 01:17:28,085
Cookie! We did it!

1460
01:17:30,057 --> 01:17:32,992
-We took the Mayflower!
-You're so beautiful!

1461
01:17:33,194 --> 01:17:36,288
Oh, my God! Oh, thank you!

1462
01:17:56,353 --> 01:17:59,516
After the Mayflower,
we came back to Fern City...

1463
01:17:59,723 --> 01:18:02,453
...and we were celebrities.

1464
01:18:02,659 --> 01:18:03,489
We were big.

1465
01:18:03,660 --> 01:18:07,027
We were big. Everything just broke
loose like a cannon.

1466
01:18:07,230 --> 01:18:10,427
We were given the key to the city
from the mayor.

1467
01:18:10,634 --> 01:18:13,762
-With a picture in the newspaper.
-Picture in the newspaper.

1468
01:18:15,005 --> 01:18:16,165
We, we, we had....

1469
01:18:16,373 --> 01:18:18,568
-Radio interviews.
-Radio interviews.

1470
01:18:18,775 --> 01:18:21,039
-Three.
-Three radio interviews.

1471
01:18:21,378 --> 01:18:24,836
And you know, at some point,
a good friend of ours said:

1472
01:18:25,048 --> 01:18:27,983
"You know, you've got
all these great songs...

1473
01:18:28,251 --> 01:18:31,243
...that you do about your Terriers,
and you're....

1474
01:18:31,454 --> 01:18:33,046
Do something with them...

1475
01:18:33,256 --> 01:18:34,848
...because you're celebrities now."

1476
01:18:35,058 --> 01:18:37,151
We never thought of it.
We were just doing it for fun.

1477
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:40,955
Just for the love of Terriers.
But, thinking, "Yeah. Why not?"

1478
01:18:41,164 --> 01:18:43,598
There's something to be said for that.

1479
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:47,668
Back yard, front yard, or the park

1480
01:18:48,638 --> 01:18:52,005
Play with it till it gets dark

1481
01:18:53,476 --> 01:18:56,877
Take it home after a while.

1482
01:18:57,814 --> 01:18:59,304
Then chew it up

1483
01:18:59,516 --> 01:19:01,916
Terrier style
Bow-wow

1484
01:19:03,653 --> 01:19:04,779
Delish

1485
01:19:08,058 --> 01:19:09,616
Some dish

1486
01:19:11,428 --> 01:19:13,225
-Cookie?
-Yeah?

1487
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:14,687
Cookie Googleman?

1488
01:19:17,033 --> 01:19:18,591
Does this ring a bell?

1489
01:19:18,802 --> 01:19:22,203
I'm not wearing underwear

1490
01:19:25,375 --> 01:19:27,900
-Bulge?
-Yeah, that's me!

1491
01:19:28,478 --> 01:19:29,467
Bulge?

1492
01:19:29,679 --> 01:19:31,840
-Get out of town!
-It's me!

1493
01:19:32,048 --> 01:19:33,675
You look fantastic.

1494
01:19:33,883 --> 01:19:36,647
You too. You've grown.

1495
01:19:36,953 --> 01:19:40,013
I'm growing right now, girl,
just looking at you.

1496
01:19:40,223 --> 01:19:44,319
That is the one and only time
I've ever done it on a roller coaster.

1497
01:19:45,462 --> 01:19:48,158
I like both of them.
And we could fiind something there.

1498
01:19:48,365 --> 01:19:51,960
But what I like about these,
and Sherri Ann would agree....

1499
01:19:52,168 --> 01:19:53,226
Honey?

1500
01:19:53,703 --> 01:19:56,331
If we could get this picture
of the dog...

1501
01:19:56,539 --> 01:19:57,904
...and maybe one of these....

1502
01:19:58,108 --> 01:20:00,008
Gosh, it's been a year.

1503
01:20:00,210 --> 01:20:02,508
So much has happened. Oh, my gosh.

1504
01:20:03,346 --> 01:20:04,540
Well...

1505
01:20:05,315 --> 01:20:07,408
...we didn't win at Mayflower.

1506
01:20:07,617 --> 01:20:12,384
Which is surreal and was
extremely disturbing.

1507
01:20:12,589 --> 01:20:15,080
-It was so not right.
-It was devastating.

1508
01:20:16,092 --> 01:20:19,493
But the silver lining of this cloud,
of course, is that...

1509
01:20:19,696 --> 01:20:23,427
...you know, it brought us
to a new level in our relationship.

1510
01:20:24,534 --> 01:20:27,298
And now we got to open up
these offices...

1511
01:20:27,504 --> 01:20:29,369
...and publish this magazine here.

1512
01:20:29,572 --> 01:20:33,941
American Bitch. The dog magazine
for women and their dogs.

1513
01:20:35,545 --> 01:20:39,914
It's a focus on the issues of
the lesbian purebred dog owner.

1514
01:20:40,116 --> 01:20:43,381
We're on our third issue.
These are our first two issues here.

1515
01:20:43,586 --> 01:20:46,111
And it's fantastic, you know?

1516
01:20:46,556 --> 01:20:49,719
Sherri Ann is definitely
the inspiration and, you know...

1517
01:20:49,926 --> 01:20:51,951
...and I do the grunt work,
the details.

1518
01:20:52,429 --> 01:20:54,590
She has a very big heart.

1519
01:20:54,798 --> 01:20:57,995
She's generous. She's kind.

1520
01:20:58,301 --> 01:21:01,293
-She's sweet.
-Well, vice versa.

1521
01:21:01,538 --> 01:21:03,938
Yeah. She's changed my life.

1522
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:07,268
And, and as it turns out, she's...

1523
01:21:07,477 --> 01:21:09,502
...dynamite in the sack.

1524
01:21:11,748 --> 01:21:14,273
Likewise, I'm sure.

1525
01:21:16,753 --> 01:21:18,618
After the dog show...

1526
01:21:18,855 --> 01:21:21,323
...l was on an EI AI flight
to Haifa...

1527
01:21:21,524 --> 01:21:24,652
...faster than a walnut could roll off
a henhouse roof.

1528
01:21:25,128 --> 01:21:29,360
And I spent about three weeks
on a kibbutz, just mellowing out.

1529
01:21:29,566 --> 01:21:30,828
Of course, they make you work.

1530
01:21:31,034 --> 01:21:33,298
But it was a goodplace
to clear your mind.

1531
01:21:33,503 --> 01:21:36,495
And I realized that I had
a lot to offer...

1532
01:21:36,706 --> 01:21:40,665
...besides just having a fishing shop
and going to dog shows, though.

1533
01:21:40,877 --> 01:21:43,368
I've been working pretty hard on...

1534
01:21:43,580 --> 01:21:46,606
...mastering the art
of ventriloquism...

1535
01:21:46,816 --> 01:21:50,013
...which is an ancient art.

1536
01:21:50,653 --> 01:21:54,521
And it requires a kind of
scientifiic mind.

1537
01:21:54,724 --> 01:21:58,285
And I enjoy being able
to put people...

1538
01:21:58,495 --> 01:22:00,622
...in another dimension,
so to speak...

1539
01:22:00,830 --> 01:22:03,731
...where they look around
and they don't know...

1540
01:22:03,933 --> 01:22:06,993
...where the voice is coming from,
which is the whole point, I guess.

1541
01:22:07,203 --> 01:22:11,003
-Let's all go honky-tonking
-Down in Louisiana

1542
01:22:11,207 --> 01:22:14,870
-Where the biscuits and gravy are like
-Dixie 's manna

1543
01:22:15,078 --> 01:22:17,706
Let's go honky-tonking
They'll be

1544
01:22:17,914 --> 01:22:18,938
Glad to see us

1545
01:22:19,149 --> 01:22:22,141
On a Louisiana night

1546
01:22:43,773 --> 01:22:47,402
All right, I'm coming. I only have
five arms. Hold your horses.

1547
01:22:47,710 --> 01:22:50,372
-We should have gotten horses.
-Little bitty horses.

1548
01:22:50,580 --> 01:22:52,013
That'd be real smart.

1549
01:22:52,215 --> 01:22:55,981
We always wanted to do this.
One thing that brought us together...

1550
01:22:56,186 --> 01:22:59,417
... was our love ofold movies
of the '30s and '40s.

1551
01:22:59,622 --> 01:23:02,113
The MGM musicals
and the great love stories.

1552
01:23:02,325 --> 01:23:05,385
So we decided to create this calendar
with our buddy Terry.

1553
01:23:05,595 --> 01:23:07,324
Terry's a photographer...

1554
01:23:07,530 --> 01:23:08,895
...he lives really near us.

1555
01:23:09,098 --> 01:23:13,626
He took these pictures for us about
two years ago for Stefan's birthday.

1556
01:23:13,836 --> 01:23:15,133
-Which are--
-Boudoir shots.

1557
01:23:15,338 --> 01:23:16,771
You're not allowed to see them.

1558
01:23:16,973 --> 01:23:18,873
It's, sort of, that kind of thing.

1559
01:23:19,075 --> 01:23:21,805
And we love them.
And Terry's very talented.

1560
01:23:22,011 --> 01:23:24,639
And he loves our dogs.
So we had this idea.

1561
01:23:24,847 --> 01:23:26,781
We loved old movies so much...

1562
01:23:26,983 --> 01:23:29,577
...so we wanted to put it together...

1563
01:23:29,786 --> 01:23:31,617
...into one project...

1564
01:23:31,821 --> 01:23:34,756
... which was going to set
the world aflame.

1565
01:23:34,958 --> 01:23:37,518
I don't know if it'll do that, but....

1566
01:23:37,727 --> 01:23:40,218
We 're not gonna sell it.
It's for friends.

1567
01:23:40,430 --> 01:23:42,330
-We should try to sell it.
-Really?

1568
01:23:42,532 --> 01:23:45,968
Shih Tzus in the great love scenes
of the-- Well, maybe.

1569
01:23:46,502 --> 01:23:49,699
If we could give the money
to Shih Tzu Rescue.

1570
01:23:49,906 --> 01:23:51,396
-They have plenty of money.
-So do we.

1571
01:23:51,608 --> 01:23:53,508
And what Shih Tzus need rescuing,
anyway?

1572
01:23:53,710 --> 01:23:57,043
What Shih Tzu is straggling around the
street with an old coat saying:

1573
01:23:57,247 --> 01:24:00,478
-"Help! Alms for the poor!"
-Like the little match girl.

1574
01:24:01,584 --> 01:24:04,314
So, how have things been going?

1575
01:24:04,787 --> 01:24:07,017
Everything's changed for the better.

1576
01:24:07,490 --> 01:24:09,424
-We are so happy now.
-We are so happy.

1577
01:24:09,626 --> 01:24:12,254
And our sex life is finally
back on track, huh?

1578
01:24:12,462 --> 01:24:15,590
-Good.
-Beatrice had so many problems.

1579
01:24:15,798 --> 01:24:17,459
She was a real problem.

1580
01:24:17,667 --> 01:24:19,897
-Poor thing.
-Just negative.

1581
01:24:20,103 --> 01:24:22,799
-Very negative dog.
-Very negative.

1582
01:24:23,139 --> 01:24:25,266
And hurtful, I thought.

1583
01:24:25,908 --> 01:24:27,603
Didn't you think so?

1584
01:24:28,278 --> 01:24:29,438
And our new dog, IKipper...

1585
01:24:30,346 --> 01:24:31,608
...is fantastic.

1586
01:24:31,814 --> 01:24:33,679
Oh, talk about a winner.

1587
01:24:34,784 --> 01:24:38,015
-Such a winner.
-And he doesn't mind us having sex.

1588
01:24:38,221 --> 01:24:41,190
-He likes it. He likes to watch.
-He likes to watch.

1589
01:24:41,824 --> 01:24:44,122
-Oh, honey.
-What we went through, huh?

1590
01:24:44,494 --> 01:24:45,825
It was horrible.

1591
01:24:46,763 --> 01:24:48,390
-He's a good dog.
-He is a good dog.

1592
01:24:48,598 --> 01:24:50,395
And you're a good lady.
