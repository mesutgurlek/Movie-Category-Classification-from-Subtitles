1
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,592
I used to think a wedding
was a simple affair.

2
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,712
Boy and girl meet.
They fall in love. He buys a ring.

3
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,308
She buys a dress.
They say, "l do."

4
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,997
I was wrong.
That's getting married.

5
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,079
A wedding is an entirely
different proposition.

6
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,237
I know.
I've just been through one.

7
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,669
Not my own,
my daughter's--

8
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,951
Annie Banks-MacKenzie.

9
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,231
That's her married name--
MacKenzie.

10
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,628
I'll be honest with you.

11
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,639
When I bought this house 17 years ago,
it cost less than this blessed event...

12
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,275
in which Annie Banks
became Annie Banks-MacKenzie.

13
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,789
I'm told that one day
I'll look back on all this...

14
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,356
with great affection
and nostalgia.

15
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,517
I hope so.

16
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,835
You fathers will understand.

17
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,793
You have a little girl...

18
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,639
an adorable little girl
who looks up to you...

19
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,355
and adores you in a way
you could never have imagined.

20
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,600
I remember how her little hand
used to fit inside mine...

21
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,235
how she used to lover to sit on my lap
and lean her head against my chest.

22
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,238
She said I was her hero.

23
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,271
Then the day comes when she wants
to get her ears pierced...

24
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,437
and wants you to drop her off a block
before the movie theatre.

25
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,597
Next thing you know, she's
wearing eye shadow and high heels.

26
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,156
From that moment on
you're in a constant state of panic.

27
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,874
You worry about her going out
with the wrong kind of guys...

28
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,560
the kind of guys
who only want one thing.

29
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,557
And you know exactly
what that one thing is...

30
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,910
because it's the same thing you wanted
when you were their age.

31
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,517
Then she gets a little older...

32
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,473
and you quit worrying about her
meeting the wrong guy...

33
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,319
and you worry about her
meeting the right guy.

34
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,194
And that's the biggest fear
of all because...

35
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,079
then you lose her.

36
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,510
And before you know it, you're sitting
all alone in a big, empty house...

37
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,475
wearing rice on your tux,
wondering what happened to your life.

38
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,115
It was just six months ago
that it happened here.

39
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,199
Just six months ago
that the storm broke.

40
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,637
Annie had been studying
for her masters in architecture...

41
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,671
for the past semester in Rome.

42
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,155
I remember I was at work,
walking through the factory.

43
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,068
I own a company called Sidekicks.
We manufacture athletic shoes.

44
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,873
Anyway, I remember
how preoccupied I was that day.

45
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,355
- I'm sorry, Mr Banks.
- My fault, Grace.

46
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:03,758
Annie had never been that far away from
home, and she was due back any minute.

47
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,314
I couldn't wait
to see the kid.

48
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,191
George, she landed.

49
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,788
My daughter has been studying abroad,
been flying for 11 hours.

50
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,434
I'm not wild about her being
in the air. You have kids, Juan.

51
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,199
You understand. It's-lt's better
when they're on the ground.

52
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,190
I've always been
a concerned parent.

53
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,517
I'm big on car seats,
seat belts, bedtimes, curfews...

54
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,552
calling when you get somewhere,
never running with a sharp object.

55
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,796
- Hi, George.
- What can I say? I'm a father.

56
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,037
- Worrying comes with the territory.
- Is Nina picking her up at the airport?

57
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,229
- Yeah.
- And you're gonna meet them?

58
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,952
Yeah. Yeah,
I'm going home right now.

59
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,911
I, uh-- My keys are--

60
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,029
- Here.
- Oh, yeah. Sorry.

61
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,037
- And sign this.
- Okay.

62
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,590
- Hat.
- Okay, thanks. Now-- Oh!

63
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,514
- Okay. Bye.
- Bring her by.

64
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,276
I left work early because I had
a little something to pick up
for Annie's homecoming.

65
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,157
We live in a small town in
Southern California called San Marino.

66
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,555
I love this town, and not
just because it's the kind of place...

67
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,671
where people still
smile at each other...

68
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,156
- Bye.
- but because it hasn't changed much
in the past 25 years.

69
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,159
And since I'm not a guy who's big on
change, this town fits me like a glove.

70
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,029
I got Annie's ten-speed
all cleaned up and polished.

71
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,072
New seats, new tyres.
I couldn't wait to show it to her.

72
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,554
This is our house.
24 Maple Drive.

73
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,069
Annie was just in grammar school
when we bought it.

74
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,954
A few years later, we got
a surprise package-- our son Matt.

75
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,674
I love this house.
I love that I taught my kids...

76
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,677
to ride their bikes
in the driveway.

77
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,394
I love that I slept with them
in tents in the backyard.

78
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,035
I love that we carved our initials
in the tree out front.

79
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,276
This house is warm in the winter,
cool in the summer...

80
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,675
and looks spectacular
with Christmas lights.

81
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,429
It's a great house,
and I never want to move.

82
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,596
But the think I think
I like best about this house...

83
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,280
are the voices I hear
when I walk through the door.

84
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,675
- Hey. Hi. You got out early.
- Hi.

85
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,995
- Where is she?
- Oh, she's, uh, unpacking.

86
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,671
She looks-- She looks so fabulous,
just fabulous. Different.

87
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,473
- Anyway, she can't wait to see you.
- Different.

88
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,795
- Ciao, Papa.
- Hey.

89
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,831
Annie brought me this candy bar
all the way from Rome.

90
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,996
Let's not get it
on our American furniture.

91
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,588
Matty. The high tops.

92
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,159
- Hey, grazie.
- Hey, you're welcome.

93
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,273
- What do you mean, different?
- Oh.

94
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,630
- Annie.
- Hi, Dad.

95
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,431
Hey, hey, hey!

96
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,996
- God, I missed you.
- You look all lit up inside.

97
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,918
Oh, I feel
all lit up inside.

98
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,713
- Maybe we should go to Rome
for a few months, honey.
- Oh, you two would love it.

99
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,434
It's the most romantic place
on Earth.

100
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,916
- You smell pretty good too.
- Oh, you like it? It was a present.

101
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,838
Doesn't she look incredible?
I almost didn't recognize her.

102
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,839
Come on. Dinner's on the stove.
Honey, you wanna come?

103
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,918
Oh, Mom, I had this pasta in Florence.
I forget what it's called.

104
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,792
All right. Now that
we're all back under one roof...

105
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,434
we have some very important items
to discuss.

106
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,791
First on the list: Who wants to go
to the Laker game on Thursday?

107
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,480
- Oh.
- Me. Definitely yes.

108
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,919
Okay, and with
your busy schedule too.

109
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,076
Honey, I can't. I have
inventory to do that night.

110
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,351
- Aw.
- Uh, Thursday, sure. Absolutely.

111
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,597
- Okay.
- Matty, could you use your fork?

112
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,792
Number two: Paul Simon
is coming to the Forum...

113
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,751
and I think I can
get us great seats.

114
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,000
- Um, yeah, sure.
- All right. Paul Simon's
an "um, yeah, sure..."

115
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,350
which I believe
translates to a yes?

116
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,948
- All right. I'll call that guy.
- Um, honey?

117
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,991
Could you please get that
bottle of wine in the fridge for me?

118
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,112
- Sure.
- Dad, wait. Um, I don't know.

119
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,915
- You don't want to see Paul Simon?
- No, l-l do. It's just, um--

120
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,234
- Well, what is it?
- Well--

121
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,590
- Honey, is something going on?
- Yes.

122
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,838
Yeah, it is, Mom. Uh-- God, this is
a hard thing to tell parents.

123
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,872
Especially when they're
my parents. Oh, God.

124
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,672
Honey, just say it.
What's the big deal?

125
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,075
- Yeah.
- Okay.

126
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,873
I met somebody in Rome.
Um, he's an American.

127
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,993
Uh, he's from L.A., actually,
and, um, his name's Bryan MacKenzie.

128
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,954
And he's this
completely wonderful...

129
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,755
wonderful, amazing man, and--

130
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,553
Well, we, we started
seeing each other...

131
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,797
a lot, and, um...

132
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,797
we fell in love.

133
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,639
It actually happened.
And, uh...

134
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:55,959
we've decided to get married
which means that I'm engaged!

135
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,958
I'm engaged!
I'm getting married!

136
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,715
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

137
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,910
Well, my, my.

138
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,828
Oh, so-- Oh, my. And that's
your engagement ring, huh?

139
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,396
Yes, yes! We got it
at a flea market outside of Rome.

140
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,479
The guy we bought it from said
it was at least 100 years old.

141
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,673
- Wow.
- So, Dad. Stop it. Say something.

142
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,793
I-l'm sorry.
What did you say?

143
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,718
Dad, I met a man in Rome,
and he's wonderful...

144
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,037
and brilliant,
and we're getting married.

145
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,554
- Mom, what's he doing?
- George.

146
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,995
George, what is it?

147
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,875
Well. This is-- This--

148
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,195
This is ridiculous.

149
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,834
- What?
- You're-- You're-- You're
too young to get married.

150
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,952
Too young? Dad, I'm 22.
If I'm not mistaken...

151
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,640
that's, that's a year older
than Mom was when you guys got married.

152
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,877
- That is absolutely not true.
- Oh, no, you-- Ha!

153
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,752
You're absolutely wrong.

154
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,553
- You were this age when I married you?
- No! I was younger.

155
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,911
I was this age
when she was born.

156
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,315
That-- That-- That doesn't matter.
Times have changed.

157
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,956
You mother was mature, and, uh,
22 isn't what it used to--

158
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,675
Matty, would you turn on
the air conditioner? It's hot in here.

159
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,870
I thought-- I thought you didn't
believe in marriage.

160
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,468
I thought that it meant
that a woman lost her identity.

161
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,989
I-l thought you wanted to get a job
before you settled down...

162
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,236
so you could earn money
and be your own person.

163
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,952
All right. Hold on.

164
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,356
I didn't think I believed
in marriage until I met Bryan.

165
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,436
And Bryan's not like any other guy
I've ever known.

166
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,391
I want to be married to him.

167
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,080
And I'm not gonna lose
my identity with him...

168
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,636
because he's not
some overpowering, macho guy.

169
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:48,719
I mean, he's like you, Dad,
except he's brilliant.

170
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,037
He happens to love the fact
that I want to be an architect.

171
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,197
He wants me to design
a house for us to live in.

172
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,153
He said he'd move
anywhere I got a job.

173
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,157
Give me a little credit, George.

174
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,078
I'm not gonna marry some ape
who wants me to wear...

175
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,350
go-go boots and an apron.

176
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,075
I'm telling you you'll love him.
He's a genius.

177
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,077
And sweet.

178
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,035
And l-- I love him more
than anything in the world.

179
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,754
- What does Bryan do?
- Who's Bryan?

180
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:26,474
- I forgot his name!
- He's an independent
communications consultant.

181
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,795
- Independent?
- Yes.

182
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:33,311
Yeah. That's code for "unemployed." This
is perfect. You meet an unemployed...

183
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,716
amazingly brilliant non-ape
that I'm going to have to support.

184
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,434
I suppose I'm going to have to hire him
and fire some hard-working guy...

185
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,915
with three kids
because my son-in-law--

186
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,430
the, the independent
communications consultant--

187
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,516
can't get a job anywhere else.

188
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:51,030
No wonder he'll move
anywhere you get a job.

189
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,958
You're not getting married,
and that's it, and that's final.

190
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,436
And I don't like you calling me George.
I mean, when did this start?

191
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,551
Daddy, what is wrong with you?

192
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,276
What? You're telling me
you're happy about this ?

193
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,356
George, please, will you stop
acting like a lunatic father...

194
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,869
and go out and talk to her
before she runs out that door...

195
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,070
marries this kid
and we never see her again?

196
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,917
All right.

197
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,471
"Kid." How do you know he's a kid?
He could be 45 years old.

198
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,597
An independent
communications consultant...

199
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:47,633
does not mean
he's an unemployable non-ape.

200
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,150
Bryan happens to be
a computer genius.

201
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,113
Companies send him all over the world
hooking up these complex systems.

202
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,118
Major banks and corporations
send him to, to Tokyo...

203
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,798
and Brazil and Geneva.

204
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,558
I mean, he's--
He's a genius.

205
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,593
You mentioned that.
How old is this genius?

206
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,917
Twenty-six, not forty-five.

207
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,873
You guys still think I can't hear you
when you're one room away.

208
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,519
If you love him so much,
I know I'll love him too.

209
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,238
- Bryan?
- Mackenzie.

210
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,635
Bryan MacKenzie.

211
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,876
- Yeah.
- I can't wait to meet him.

212
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,072
Good, 'cause he'll be here
in an hour to meet you.

213
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,514
I suppose you're not in the mood
for a little one-on-one?

214
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:42,030
- Daddy, I'm wearing heels.
- Come to the right place.

215
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,953
I've got sunshine

216
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,196
On a cloudy day

217
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,988
When it's cold outside

218
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,588
I've got the month of May

219
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,353
-He's got it behind the back. The crowd
is going wild. The crowd is going wild.
-I guess

220
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,710
- It's-- It's--
- You say

221
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:15,072
What can make me feel this way

222
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,317
My girl, my girl
my girl

223
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,591
- Talkin' 'bout my girl
- Hey!

224
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:27,352
My girl, ooh-ooh

225
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,435
Hey, hey, hey

226
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,949
- Hey, hey, hey
- Yes.

227
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,874
- Dad!
- Yes!

228
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,594
Oh, travelling!

229
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:53,508
I don't need no money

230
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,950
Fortune or fame

231
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,718
I got all the riches, baby

232
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,274
- This is it. Eight up.
- One man can claim.

233
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,594
- Go.
- Ready?

234
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,200
Well, I guess

235
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,436
- You'll say
- Hold on.
- No!

236
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,997
- What can make me feel this way
- Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
No, no, no, no. No!

237
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,351
My girl, my girl
my girl

238
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,119
- Talkin' 'bout my girl
- Yes!

239
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,437
My girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl

240
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,233
- I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
- All right.

241
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,954
With my girl

242
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,718
I've even got the month of May

243
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,273
You're not really getting married,
are you?

244
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,675
Dad, stop!

245
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,679
- So can you see him?
What does he look like?
- He just drove up.

246
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,473
And?

247
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,114
He drove too fast.

248
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:14,112
Well, wait. So, George,
you want to meet him?

249
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,913
Do I want to meet him?

250
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,196
- Oh, hello. Hi.
- Hello, I'm Brian MacKenzie.

251
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,709
Good. I'm Nina Banks.

252
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,910
Yes. Yes, I recognize you
from your picture.

253
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,871
- Yes, come in, please.
- The one Annie had with her in Rome.

254
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,835
- Yes. Oh, good. Come in.
- Okay. Hello, Mr Banks.

255
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,952
It was the first time I ever
hated the sound of my own name.

256
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,992
- Hi.
- I've heard so much about you.

257
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,190
It's great
to finally meet you, sir.

258
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,756
"Sir." Two words
now crossed my mind:

259
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,677
"brown" and "nose."

260
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,429
Annie talks about you so much,
I feel like I already know you.

261
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,358
- Bryan.
- Oh, Annie.

262
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,678
- So this is him.
- Oh, he's just-- Uh, just.

263
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,837
A little nervous. Just like one
of those situations you read about...

264
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,679
you know,
meeting the in-laws.

265
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,395
But you two seem great. I'm sure
I have nothing to be nervous about.

266
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,750
But, uh, still, l--

267
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,155
Let's, let's, uh, uh,
go into the, uh, uh, the, uh--

268
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,475
The-- uh-- Great.

269
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,750
- I think he's adorable.
- I don't like him.

270
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,190
- Oh, George, for God--
- He's wearing Nikes.

271
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,874
- Mom, where's Matty?
- Oh, he fell asleep watching TV.

272
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,470
- Oh, well, you'll meet him tomorrow.
- Okay.

273
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,477
- Sit down.
- So.

274
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,751
Um, how did you two, uh, meet?

275
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,317
Oh. We were the only two people
at this revival house in Rome...

276
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,273
for a midnight showing
of Bringing Up Baby.

277
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,914
- We kept hearing each other laugh.
- And at all the same places.

278
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,508
Yeah. When it was over,
I picked him up.

279
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,437
Oh, no, no, no. I went over
to you to ask directions...

280
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,757
and then one thing
led to another and--

281
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,916
And that was it.
For the next three months...

282
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,951
we never left
each other's sight.

283
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,868
We went to all these museums,
all these great concerts, the opera.

284
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,310
We travelled to the country. Remember
that place we stayed in Tuscany?

285
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,113
Oh, with the, uh--

286
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,038
- Uh, suffice it to say,
it was not a four-star hotel.
- No.

287
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,071
You have a very brave daughter.

288
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,073
Bryan, um, what is it exactly
that you do?

289
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,714
Annie was saying
something about computers.

290
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,957
Uh, yes, uh, I'm an independent
communications consultant.

291
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,798
Yeah, yeah,
that part I heard.

292
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,150
Sounds fake, right?
Like it's not a real job?

293
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,555
- No, we wouldn't say that. No.
- That's what my dad said...

294
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,272
when he first heard
what I was doing.

295
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,517
But, um, what it is,
uh, in this case:

296
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,437
Uh, Pacific lnternational Bank
sent me to Rome to hook up...

297
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,869
the X-Dot connection
to their European subsidiary.

298
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,630
Um-- Uh, all European computers, uh,
communicate on the Dot 25 network.

299
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,910
And, uh, since Pacific lnternational
is an L.A.-based firm...

300
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:04,113
they wanted to interface with standard
European protocol, so I set 'em up.

301
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:10,073
And, uh, why are you, uh, independent?
What was that?

302
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,237
Because no one can afford
to keep him on staff.

303
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,319
Well, I guess that's true,
basically, but, uh--

304
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,513
You know, driving down here,
I tried to put myself in your place.

305
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,790
Your daughter comes home
after spending four months in Rome...

306
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,275
a-and I'm sure you couldn't wait
to see her, and she shocks you...

307
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,675
with the news
that she's getting married.

308
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,756
And to somebody
you've never met before.

309
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,269
I'm sure that
must've been pretty...

310
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,358
um, heavy...

311
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,392
to use a word
from your generation.

312
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,193
I just wanna say
that I'm an upstanding citizen.

313
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,197
I've-l've never been
engaged before.

314
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,915
I've, uh, never really
been in love before.

315
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,272
And, uh, I think Annie's
the greatest person I've ever met.

316
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,834
And I can't wait
to marry her and...

317
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,316
one day have children
and grandchildren.

318
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,238
And I'm gonna do my best
to be supportive of her dreams.
And she's a very gifted architect.

319
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,432
Um-- I'm just thrilled
that I met her.

320
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,597
I love your daughter.

321
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:18,430
And the feelings that I have for her
are never gonna change.

322
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,711
And I'm here to stay.

323
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,274
- Oh, honey.
- Mom.

324
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,157
I'm so happy for you.

325
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,316
That's okay, Mr Banks,
We don't have to hug.

326
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,749
- Well, uh, maybe later.
- I know.

327
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,158
Well, that was just, um--
That was just the best thing
I've ever heard anybody say.

328
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,995
- Oh. Good.
- Well, I meant it.

329
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,395
Listen, I want to take Bryan out
for a drive, show him around San Marino.

330
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,795
- Okay, honey. Good.
- Annie, it's a little nippy out.

331
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,115
- You might want to put on a sweater.
- Oh, Dad, it's okay. I'm kinda warm.

332
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,753
Still, there's a chill in the air,
and you've been on a plane.

333
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,075
- Dad, I'm fine.
- Annie, it is kinda cold out.

334
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,155
- It is?
- Yeah.

335
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,750
- All right, thanks. I'll get my jacket.
- All right.

336
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,759
Right then, I realized
my day had passed.

337
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,156
She'll always love me, of course,
but not in the same way.

338
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,192
I was no longer the man
in my little girl's life.

339
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,754
I was like an old shoe,
the kind we manufacture...

340
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:15,873
and get all excited about and then
after a few years discontinue.

341
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,152
That was me now:
Mr Discontinued.

342
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,919
Mom? Don't wait up, okay?
We might stop for a cappuccino.

343
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,235
Oh, okay, fine.
Well, good night, Bryan.

344
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,476
Good night.
Um, good night, Mr Banks.

345
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,750
Oh, you can call him George,
or Dad.

346
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,394
- George will be fine.
- Okay. Uh--

347
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,875
I'll say it next time I see you.

348
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,754
Drive carefully, and don't forget
to fasten your condom.

349
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,552
- Dad!
- Seat belt!

350
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,399
I meant-- I meant
seat belt.

351
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,752
Um, I'm putting your father to bed.
This has been a very big night for him.

352
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,552
- Bye.
- Okay.
- Well, good night.

353
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,999
- Have fun.
- Bye.
- Good night.

354
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,714
- Bye.
- Bye-bye. Have fun.
- Bye.

355
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,788
This is a great kid.

356
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,434
- It'll never last.
- Wanna bet?

357
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,835
Nina, Annie's much too spirited
for this kid.

358
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,316
He's totally wrong for her.
I give it two months, tops. One month.

359
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,238
This is the right guy for Annie, George.
I'm telling you, I feel it in my bones.

360
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,396
- I mean, we're two lucky parents.
We are.
- Lucky? Oh!

361
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,398
What about his laugh? It was such
a giveaway. It was so phoney with his--

362
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,511
- I thought it was totally sincere.
- Oh, please.

363
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,313
What about that little rehearsed speech
he gave? It was right out of a book.

364
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,351
How To Grease Your Future
Mother-ln-Law.

365
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,790
You're off here, George,
really. I thought it was
completely from his heart.

366
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,036
- Why do you think I cried?
- Good question.

367
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,515
I don't know why either of you cried.
I'm losing my voice.

368
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,632
- Are my glands swollen or something?
- Let me see. No. No, honey, no.

369
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,512
And what about
the way he kept touching her?

370
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,915
- What do you mean?
- What do you mean what do I mean?

371
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,110
- He could-- He couldn't
keep his hands off her.
- Oh, yes. Kind of like...

372
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,630
when we were engaged, except that
wasn't all you couldn't keep off me.

373
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,718
That was different.
And we certainly never
acted that way in your parents' house.

374
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,230
Ah! You want me to name all the rooms
we did it in at my parents' house?

375
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,920
That was different.
We were like two imbeciles.

376
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,634
- This is our child we're talking about.
- Our child? Oh, George.

377
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,594
You know, I still think you see Annie
as a seven-year-old in pigtails.

378
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,358
Well, you know, that just shows
how much you know about me...

379
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,835
because that is not at all
how I see her.

380
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,554
Right, a seven-year-old
with pigtails.

381
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,513
I mean, here's the thing: We have
no idea who this Bryan really is.

382
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,359
- Oh. Uh-huh.
- I mean, if that's his real name.
I mean, who knows?

383
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,836
You know, maybe he already has a wife.
You read about these cases every day--

384
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,635
you know, men who have wives and
families stashed all across the country.

385
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,672
I mean, he could be a professional
con artist who meets innocents abroad...

386
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:28,351
and gives them this song and dance about
being an independent whatever that was.

387
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,438
And then skips out after bilking them
for all they're worth.

388
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,199
- Wh-What are you doing?
- I'm getting ready for bed.

389
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,073
You know, then I suppose you're not
interested that I believe
I remember seeing someone...

390
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,634
who looked like Bryan's twin
on America's Most Wanted.

391
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,877
You're right.
I'm not.

392
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,195
George.

393
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,197
George, l-l thought he was great.

394
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,595
I liked him a lot.
And I'm really ha-- Ann--

395
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,190
George, will you please stop making
that face? I'm very happy for Annie.

396
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,754
I'm excited for her.
This is a big deal.

397
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:59,395
I think that we should
at least hug.

398
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,034
This is great news.

399
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,037
Oh, a wedding.

400
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,352
Father of the bride.
Can you believe it?

401
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,275
Forty-eight hours later,
the wedding was still on...

402
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,597
and we were on our way to Bel-Air
to meet Bryan's folks.

403
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,995
I don't know why we have to have
brunch with total strangers.

404
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,159
Because their son is marrying
our daughter and it's not
an unusual custom meeting the in-laws.

405
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,556
You know, that's another thing.
I hate that expression: in-laws.

406
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,990
What does it mean anyway?
We're legally bound to these people?

407
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:42,033
I don't wanna be "in-lawed," especially
to people who live in Bel-Air.

408
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,675
I mean, what kind of people
have brunch and live in Bel-Air?

409
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,109
Rich people.

410
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,279
They probably live in the one shack
in the middle of all these mansions.

411
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,198
- Nice mood, George.
- What? I'm in a good mood.

412
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,512
Okay, I think this is it.
Yeah.

413
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,158
- Nice shack, babe.
- Worse. It's the biggest house
on the street.

414
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:11,750
Now we're related to
pretentious snobs. Just what we need.

415
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,034
You look very handsome, George,
way too young to be in-lawed.

416
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:40,789
Well, it really shouldn't matter
how I look. We're not here
to win their approval.

417
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,398
Just because you
changed your outfit five times.

418
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,351
Oh, and you didn't try on
nine different shirts?

419
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,754
- Two.
- Two.

420
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,518
Two long-sleeve,
two short-sleeve.

421
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,030
- Hi!
- George, Nina, welcome.

422
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,479
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- I'm John.

423
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,717
- How do you do?
- Hi, I'm Joanna.

424
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,159
- Welcome. Come in, please.
- Welcome to our house. Come on in.

425
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:02,113
- Come in.
- Thank you so much. Well.

426
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,869
All I could think about
was the size of this place.

427
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,389
We could've parked our whole house
in the foyer.

428
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:12,069
Ah, what a nerve-racking thing,
meeting your future in-laws.

429
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,270
- Yeah.
- What a relief. You two
look perfectly normal.

430
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,915
Oh, well, I am.

431
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,759
I have to tell you,
we got so nervous about today...

432
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,429
about meeting the two of you,
l-l must've tried
on three different outfits.

433
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,393
- Oh.
- I changed my shirt four times.

434
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,991
- Can you imagine anyone
being that jerky?
- Oh, I know.

435
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,951
So, come on in. I thought
we'd have lunch in here.

436
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,469
- Oh, what a great room.
- Marta.
- Thank you, Marta.

437
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:41,071
Marta, estos son nuestros in-laws,
George and Nina Banks.

438
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,077
- Hello.
- How do you do? Hi.

439
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,715
Oh, and here's
the rest of our family.

440
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,594
Oh, don't worry. They look like killers,
but they're actually quite friendly.

441
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,518
As long as you're relaxed,
why, they're relaxed.

442
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,438
Hi, puppy, puppy, puppy.
Why, you're--

443
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,552
All right, fellas, that's enough.
Go on. Release! Good boys.

444
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,511
- Well, why don't we all sit down.
- Please.

445
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,676
- Oh, thank you.
- All right. Here we go.

446
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,917
- George. Honey.
- Thank you, sweetheart.

447
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,634
I don't know if the kids told you, but
we were over in Europe on business...

448
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,990
and we stopped in Rome
to see Bryan.

449
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,430
So we got to spend a few days
with Annie. Oh, boy!

450
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:18,632
- We just fell in love
with her immediately.
- Isn't she great?

451
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,830
Yes. We just couldn't
be happier about this.

452
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,599
How did you, uh,
take the news, George?

453
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,597
Me?

454
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:29,633
Uh, truthfully, uh, I was
a little surprised.

455
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,752
- I was shocked.
- So was l.

456
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,314
After all, they'd only known each other
a few months.

457
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,908
Exactly. And Annie's
just finishing up school.

458
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,110
Absolutely. Oh, believe me,
I tossed and turned over this one...

459
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,073
but the bottom line
is they're in love.

460
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,839
They're over 21, and whether they're
rushing into this or not...

461
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,110
may be not for us to say.

462
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,755
Right. "Not for us to say."
We're only their parents.

463
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,838
I was about to say these very words
out loud when he hit me with--

464
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,713
Yeah, sooner or later,
you just have to let your kids go...

465
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,717
and hope you
brought 'em up right.

466
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,275
George. Nina. Darling.

467
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,436
This guy was making
a little too much sense for me.

468
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:12,314
Suddenly my shirt collar felt like
it was starting to strangle me.

469
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,476
To George and Nina...

470
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,909
and a future
of wonderful memories.

471
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,156
First, the wedding
of our children...

472
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,317
and the happiness we'll share
watching their lives.

473
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,830
Then sharing the joy
of our grandchildren together.

474
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,675
Birthday parties,
graduation--

475
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:40,708
Now I knew where they got the
expression "like father, like son."

476
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:44,116
- I also knew I needed some air.
- Can you tell me where the restroom is?

477
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,789
Oh, actually, the one down here
is a mess. We're remodelling.

478
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:51,754
Uh, why don't you try
the one at the top of the stairs?
It's the seventh door on the left.

479
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,552
- Second?
- Seventh.

480
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,797
- Seventh.
- Seventh.

481
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:19,150
I'm leaving.
I'm relaxed, and I'm leaving.

482
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,318
Relent.

483
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,670
Re-- Recoil.

484
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,313
Reverse.

485
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,590
- Well, I hope George hasn't
gotten lost up there.
- Oh, no, he's gonna be fine.

486
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,280
Okay.

487
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:59,075
Well, um--
Such a lovely sculpture.

488
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,873
Oh. Doesn't it have a wonderful
sense of motion?

489
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,436
We got it in Denmark. All the-- Quite
a lot of my family's from Copenhagen.

490
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:09,189
- Is that right?
- Oh, yeah. Doesn't it have
a wonderful sense of balance?

491
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,311
- Oh, it's amazing.
- I was going to put it in the garden.

492
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,199
Well, actually, uh, uh, Bryan spent
quite a few summers in Denmark.

493
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,551
Uh, he now speaks
better Danish than, than Joanna.

494
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,952
N-- Is that a fact?

495
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,236
And we're planning a trip
back this summer.

496
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,237
I think this is
a very beautiful spread here.

497
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,397
- Oh, thank you.
- Well, shall--
should we wait for George?

498
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,437
- Maybe I should, uh, check on George.
- No.

499
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,711
- Release!
- Oh, man.

500
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:42,193
Wow. No kidding?
Really? It went great?

501
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,949
Uh, better than great. I mean, it, just,
just couldn't have gone better.

502
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,036
God, I'm so relieved.

503
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:51,277
I mean, who knows what can happen
at these things, you know?

504
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:54,039
- This is great.
- Now I feel like the wedding's
officially on.

505
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,037
Um, Dad, that looks so good.
This looks great.

506
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:59,914
Um, Bryan's mom called with the names
of her immediate family.

507
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,113
- Is this a joke?
- Not only is it not a joke...

508
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,390
but eight of them are
from Copenhagen and well...

509
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,114
it's the bride's family's
responsibility to--

510
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,834
Do you have any idea what
a round-trip ticket from Denmark costs?

511
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,951
Try eight round-trip tickets.

512
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,957
Well, actually, it's nine.

513
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,389
You see, Joanna's,
uh, cousin Gitte...

514
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:27,310
is apparently a rather large woman
so she needs two seats.

515
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,193
She can lop over into the aisle for all
I care 'cause there's no way I'm pay--

516
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,594
Hi, everyone.
Sorry I'm late.

517
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,472
- Hi.
- That's okay.
- How're you doing? Hi.

518
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,397
- Hello.
- Hey, dude.
- Hi.

519
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,273
- Oh. Here you are.
- Oh. Well, thank you.

520
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:43,156
- It's "you're welcome" in Danish.
- Ah, thanks.

521
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,159
This looks great. I hear you're
a whiz at the barbecue, Dad.

522
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:54,676
Well. So have you two given any thought
to what kind of wedding you want?

523
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,031
- Well, we've talked about it.
- Yes, and what do you think?

524
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,718
Big? Small? Or--

525
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,070
Well, it can't be too big.
We don't have that many friends.

526
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,430
So we're talking
in the small vicinity, then?

527
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,074
Well, no, she didn't say "small."
She said not too big.

528
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,668
Yeah, but nothing fancy
or overblown, right?

529
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,438
- Right.
- Right.

530
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,358
So kind of the "less is more"
theory, huh, Annie?

531
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,268
- Basically.
- The reason I'm asking all these
questions is I have a great idea...

532
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:23,235
where we can have this lovely,
not small but not too big wedding.

533
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,920
You do? Where?

534
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,191
At our favourite restaurant, the place
we've been eating at for 15 years.

535
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:33,757
The best.
The Steak Pit.

536
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:37,429
- Dad, get serious.
- I don't think
you want the word "pit"...

537
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,028
on a wedding invitation,
George.

538
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,879
Really, Dad, a rib joint
with sawdust on the floor...

539
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,389
isn't exactly what I had in mind
for my wedding.

540
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,078
- No offence.
- Well, excuse me.

541
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,156
What did you have in mind,
the Beverly Hills Hotel?

542
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,317
No. Actually, what I'd like
is to have...

543
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,670
my wedding in a church
and have the reception here.

544
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,392
- Oh.
- That's what I was hoping for.

545
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,397
Here?

546
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,717
Don't I have
the greatest Dad in the world?

547
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,070
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.

548
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,636
- Can we have some burgers?
- Okay, here's the bride burger
and your groom burger.

549
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,638
And, uh, enjoy 'em. Now, go on
over there and see the jugglers.

550
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,274
My dream wedding,
a barbecue wedding.

551
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,950
- This is a better idea
than the Steak Pit.
- Yeah.

552
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,516
We'll get some, uh, picnic tables
and, uh, crepe paper and balloons.

553
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:38,031
You know, invite all our best pals.
I'll make my famous guacamole.

554
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,516
A wedding at home.
This is a great idea.

555
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:48,399
Great idea. Picnic tables, crepe paper,
balloons, you at the barbecue.

556
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,829
- Oh, George.
- What don't you like about that?

557
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,191
Why have you been
acting so crazy since the moment
Annie told you she was getting married?

558
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,959
You know, I haven't been acting crazy.
I've simply acted...

559
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,640
Iike any normal,
red-blooded American dad.

560
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,639
Normal? Uh-huh. Okay.
Falling in the MacKenzie's pool.

561
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,990
Suggesting the Steak Pit
as a wedding reception.

562
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:09,510
Oh, watching America's Most Wanted
every night, looking for Bryan's face.

563
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:13,394
And now this picnic scenario.
George, a wedding is a big deal!

564
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,353
Everybody seems to understand this
but you. And as a matter of fact--

565
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,393
N-Now don't go nuts when I tell
you this, but when Bryan's mom...

566
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,353
called with her list, she
suggested that they might just wanna...

567
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,471
pitch in and help
with the cost of the wedding.

568
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:29,115
You know, hey, we may not have a house
the size of Rhode lsland,
but we're not poverty-stricken.

569
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,118
We can certainly afford to give
our daughter a proper wedding.

570
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,357
Proper. Not you in a chef's hat,
right, George?

571
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:38,074
- Who said anything about a chef's hat?
When did this come up?
- Yes, but I know you.

572
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,668
I'm close. Oh, look.

573
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,030
I just really saw this
whole thing differently.

574
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,720
Like, I wanted to call a wedding
coordinator to make the whole thing...

575
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,718
really, really beautiful, and you want
to call Gabe at the Steak Pit.

576
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:52,037
Wait a minute. Wedding coordinator?
What's a wedding coordinator?

577
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,630
- A person who coordinates weddings.
- What's to coordinate?

578
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,719
Well, there's the invitations
and the flowers, the food,
the band, the photographer.

579
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:03,628
George, why are you
giving me that look again? A lot
of people hire wedding coordinators.

580
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:08,276
Nina, you and I run
successful businesses. We can certainly
pull together one smallish wedding.

581
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,311
- Yeah, okay.
- We don't need
some fancy wedding coordinator.

582
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,876
Okay, George, then
let's just forget it, okay? Because,
you know, I just really can't take this.

583
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,389
- I'm not used to all this
arguing, so just, uh--
- Fine. I don't want to argue.

584
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,876
Just-- Do me a favour, okay, George?
Just go on upstairs and I'll...

585
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,514
- finish up down here.
- Fine. Fine. I'll go upstairs.

586
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,518
However, I would like
to remind you what happened
to what's-his-name down the street.

587
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,200
His daughter got married and the thing
practically broke him. Remember?

588
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,390
- I remember.
- You and I could end up...

589
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:33,398
shuffling along the sidewalk
in our bathrobes.

590
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,950
- That was a joke.
- Hilarious.

591
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:43,073
Oh, all right. I'll go.
I'll meet the wedding coordinator.

592
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,794
You know I don't want to,
but I'll go...

593
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,480
if you still want me to go,
all right?

594
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,876
- Okay?
- Okay.

595
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,629
Now, let me do the talking,
girls, okay?

596
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,637
Well, I negotiate better than you.

597
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,432
- Now what's this guy's name?
- Franck.

598
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,278
- Frank.
- Franck.

599
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,719
- Franck?
- Franck.

600
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:06,719
- Franck. Franck. Franck.
- Oh, this is it.

601
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,070
Okay, here we go.

602
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,431
- Ah, Mom.
- No. No. This is just--

603
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,630
- Oh, my, Annie.
- This is amazing.

604
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,512
- Look. Look at this trim.
- What?

605
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,312
- Oh!
- Isn't this beautiful? Pearls.

606
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,908
- Oh!
- Oh, gee.

607
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,429
-Oh, wow. I love how they did this, Mom.
-Annie.

608
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,959
- Yeah?
- Do you like this place setting?

609
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,150
- Oh, it's beautiful.
- That china also comes...

610
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,475
in a wonderful Sara Lee yellow.

611
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,956
- Hi. You must be Franck?
- I wish.

612
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:36,072
I'm Franck's assistant,
Howard Weinstein.

613
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,430
-Well, I'm Nina Banks and this is Annie.

614
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,630

00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,228
- George, my husband.
- How do you do?

616
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:47,353
May I offer anyone any refreshments:
Pellegrino, espresso, champagne?

617
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:50,870
- Oh. Um, no. No.
- No.

618
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,199
I'll alert the boss that you're here.
Look around. Have fun.

619
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,390
Oh. Oh.
This is so great.

620
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,833
- Annie.
- Yeah?

621
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:05,635
- Oh! Wouldn't this be perfect for you?
- Oh, it's gorgeous!

622
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,911
Look how it goes with the crystal.
Oh, perfect.

623
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:13,113

- Oh, the bride, the bride.

628
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,673
Right away, I realized this was
a mistake of gargantuan proportions.

629
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:31,759
This guy was going to coordinate
our wedding? How? With subtitles?

630
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,871

Very nice, I think.

635
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,152

Five munths not much!

00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:21,190
But that don't bother me so much
because it's a little bit tight...

but we can do it and

Oh! Oh!
That is incredible!

660
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,115
Annie, that's just like the one
we saw in the magazine.

661
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,992
Do you like it, Dad?

662
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:16,671
Well, what is that? ls that--
Is that dollars? $1,200?

663
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,758

for a keck of dis magnootud.

665
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:24,359
A cake, Franck, is made
of flour and water.

666
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,278
- My first car didn't cost $1,200
- George.

667
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:32,918
Well, welcome to the '90s,
Moster Bonks.

668
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:36,112
Not only did I not understand
a syllable this guy was saying...

669
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,196
now I had the feeling
he was putting me down.

670
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:41,437
Excuse me, um, Franck.

671
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,471
- Could we please have a second?
- Oh, of course!

672
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:47,798
Take two seconds. Howard,
letz return calls. Could we--

673
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,357
All right, George, what's the problem?
Do you want to leave?

674
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,596
- Do you?
- No. I like him.

675
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:59,508
I think he's going to make this
a beautiful wedding.

676
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,437
Don't look at me.
You guys decide.

677
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:05,712
Give the man a chance, George, please.
Annie, do you like this cake?

678
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:09,150
It is incredible, Dad.

679
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,077
- Well, all right.
But, look, let's just--
- I know.

680
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,236
We-- We're going to, George.
We're gonna hold things down.

681
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:16,272
- We just-- We won't go nuts.
- No. No.
- Thank you.

682
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,277
- Franck!
- Coming!

683
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:25,071
- We'll take the cake.
- Oh, good, good.

684
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,634
Don't worry, Moster Bonks. I'm gonna
bring de crew over to the house.

685
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,672
We gif everything that we haf
in the once-over department...

686
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,995
and then in the end you be
vary, vary happy, trust me.

687
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:37,079
- You just smile away.
Now, interesting idea.
- Yes.

688
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,795
Wit regard to thame and kolor
of de wedding, dis is how I see it:

689
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,434
I think we go vary elegant,
inside de tent, you know--

690
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:46,438
With one swift move,
I'd been cut out of the deal.

691
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,471
Annie, Nina and Franck
were in charge now.

692
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,999
...and bootiful china--

693
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:53,430
Now, spo! And crystal
to drop over dead for!

694
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:56,438
Old Dad was history.

695
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,393
- ...new machine to work now.
- A few days later, I was at work...

696
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,511
relieved for once not to be
talking about the wedding.

697
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:04,598
- I wore those 750-trainers
over the weekend.
- They still stiff?

698
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:08,395
- I think they need a soft--
- Just back from the Orient, ladies,
and I got a new shipment.

699
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:12,308
Beautiful merchandise.
Gucci, Cartier, Louis Vuitton.

700
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,112
- I never heard of Louis Vuitton.
- I don't know.

701
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:17,312
He's big, darling, believe me, or they
wouldn't be knocking 'em off.

702
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,953
Don't worry, Mr Banks,
they're on a break.

703
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,991
- That's okay.
- George, Franck's office, line two.

704
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:24,510
Uh, maybe I could see those mockups
by Friday, then, Dave? Thanks.

705
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,676
This was the call I'd been dreading
since the moment I heard...

706
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,189
the words, "wedding coordinator."

707
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:32,392
- Hello.
- Mr Banks, this is Howard Weinstein...

708
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,351
Franck's executive assistant.

709
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,199
I have-- estimate for you.

710
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:40,118
- I can barely hear you!
- I'm in my car...

711
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,595
going through ...water Canyon.

712
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,676
- Call you back?
- No, no, no! l-l want the estimate.

713
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,677
How much?
What's the damage?

714
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:51,032
For everything from the flowers
to the honeymoon limo--

715
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,071
Okay, everything.
How much?

716
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,112
--dred --ifty head.

717
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:59,630
You're breaking up. It sounded like
you said 150 a head.

718
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,637
No! No!

719
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:06,629
- Good. I was about to kill myself.
- It's 250 a head.

720
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,874
- Get me Nina at work.
- She just called.

721
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,629
- I need the final headcount.
- She just gave it to me.

722
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:21,832
What is it? One-fifty?

723
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,837
572.

724
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,514
$250 a head means for the four of us to
attend this wedding in our own home...

725
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,596
will cost $1,000.

726
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,312
Therefore, we are not
getting up from this table...

727
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,749
until we cut this list down
to the bare minimum.

728
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:40,599
Now, invite as many people as you want
to the church, pack 'em in...

729
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,154
build a grandstand if you want,
but we are not having...

730
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,716
more than 150 people in this house
on the day of the wedding.

731
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:51,755
-All right. Now let's start eliminating.
-Okay, Jim Pepper and wife.

732
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:56,158
- Oh, great. Start with one of my guys.
- Fine. We'll start with one of mine.
I'll cut Steve and Stephanie Turrill.

733
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,350
- They're very good
clients of mine. They're--
- Say no more. They're history.

734
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,199
- All right. Jim Pepper and wife.
- I've known the guy for 20 years.

735
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,117
You haven't seen him
in 15, George.

736
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,037
All right. I'll say
I lost his address.

737
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:09,153
Now here's somebody-- your cousin Betsy,
the poet/waitress/picture framer.

738
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,875
We can't cut family.
They know about the wedding.

739
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,391
I only invited one person: Cameron.
Mom said I could have a friend there.

740
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,954
For 250 bucks, you can see Cameron
after the wedding.

741
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:23,436
All right. Very good.
Five down. We're rolling.

742
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:26,199
All right. What about Harry Kirby?
We haven't seen him in ages.

743
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:29,949
- I don't know.
- Didn't Harry Kirby die last year?

744
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:31,832
Yes! Good!

745
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,439
Oh, uh, sorry.

746
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,074
- Who's Franck Eggelhoffer?
- What?

747
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,033
He's coordinating the wedding,
and then we're not going to invite him?

748
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,958
Exactly! Do you think
I'm gonna pay a guy 15%%%...

749
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:49,471
plus an hourly, plus an additional $500
to feed him and that assistant of his?

750
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:53,991
- Have you lost your mind?
- Can I put Cameron back on the list
if he promises not to eat?

751
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:57,556
You know, that's not a bad idea.
Who else can we ask not to eat?

752
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,557
My parents, your mother.

753
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:04,196
Why don't we just charge people? That
way we can make money on the wedding.

754
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,231
Annie. A--

755
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:13,193
I was kidding.

756
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:00,152
"How to give a beautiful wedding
on a small budget.

757
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:05,354
"Bake your own wedding cake.

758
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:10,076
"Find a good tailor and copy
a designer dress.

759
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,760
Have a friend take the pictures."

760
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:27,032
From that moment on, I decided
to shut my mouth and go with the flow.

761
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,590
My first move was to get
the old tuxedo out of mothballs.

762
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:17,274
Hey! Lookin' good, my man.

763
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,436
Get down! Hey!

764
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:24,350
What's new, pussycat
Whoa, whoa, whoa, oh

765
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:28,359
What's new, pussycat
Whoa, whoa, whoa

766
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,755
- Whoa, whoa
- George!

767
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,996
- Hey
- Annie, he's up here.

768
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:37,830
Pussycat, pussycat
I love you

769
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:40,110
'Deed I do

770
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,390
Yes, I do

771
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:45,830
Hey, what do you think?
Bought it in '75 and it still fits.

772
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:51,678
- Like a glove.
- Yes. It's just, it's a real way to go.

773
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,756
Um, maybe--

774
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:58,756
Maybe you could get a new tux.
Uh, we're all wearing new clothes, and--

775
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,838
What? Don't you think I look cute?
I mean, there will be a lot
of single gals there.

776
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,435
- I'll get it.
- Oh, oh.

777
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:09,711
Oh, by the way. Good news.
The church is free.

778
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:14,550
- Oh, finally something is free.
- I meant available.

779
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:16,477
Oh, I like that. It's very good.

780
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,352
Adorable.

781
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:23,110
Oh, they've done the shutters. It's like
kind of an I Remember Mama touch.

782
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:26,516
Oh, it"s very nice.
We change it all though. Let's go.

783
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:31,714
Franck and his crew had arrived to
finalize all the details of the wedding.

784
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:34,832
First was an audition for a band singer.

785
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:39,158
Volare
Oh, oh

786
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,397
Cantare
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

787
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,910
No wonder
Annie's happy heart sings

788
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:48,759
Bryan's love has given her wings
Hey!

789
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,677
Like birds of a feather
A rainbow together--

790
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:54,076
Just as I was about to say, "Don't
call us, we'll call you," I heard...

791
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:57,829
Howard, we'll huf to move out all de
furniture to huf any sort of room to--

792
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:01,077
Oh. Dis is a nice statement.

793
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:04,317
It's lots of fun.
Mrs Bonks, one kvestion--

794
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:07,352
Howard, uh, Franck was saying something
about moving out the furniture.

795
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:10,597
We have to move it all out
if we're going to fit
more than 200 bodies in here.

796
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:14,190
- But what if someone wants to sit down?
- We bring in chairs.

797
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:17,915
Well, if you're bringing in chairs, then
why are you moving the furniture out?

798
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:21,396
Mr Bonks, I do dis for a loving,
you know? Trust me.

799
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,511
A movink van must tek everything out.

800
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,835
It's an extra expense. Oh, sure.
Yah, yah.

801
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:27,837
Bot we need it. Annie!

802
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:30,793
Mrs Bonks. Come this way, please.
So, vhat do you think of the zinger?

803
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:32,956
- We do have other choizes.
- I'd like to see 'em.

804
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:36,117
Good. That'll be no problem.

805
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:40,028
My caterer, everyone, and my best friend
in the whole world, Hanck Kucinetzki.

806
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:42,389
Hi.

807
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,431
- Hi.
- Hi.

808
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:47,950
If I cud have a mewmunt of yer time
to discuss de monyo.

809
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:50,799
- "De monyo." "De monyo." Remind me?
The menu! Yes.
- No, the menu.

810
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:54,629
Onfortulley, Hanck doesn't
spake Anglish, so I will translit.

811
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:57,194
Franck, that'll--
that'll be a big help.

812
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,119
Dis is vhat Hanck sugjoost.
Fer the men kers, he vants to serf voll.

813
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:18,277
Oh, really?
I have a problem with that.

814
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,868
- With what?
- With veal. I keep reading...

815
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,639
there's a lot of inhumane treatment
in the way they treat the calves.

816
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,558
I read that too.
You're very chic. No voll.

817
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,357
So that leafs seafoot,
which is also chic.

818
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:33,277
Or fowl, which is not chic
but chip.

819
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:38,952
Cheap. Finally a word I understood.
My first and last piece of good news.

820
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:40,718
- Mrs Banks?
- Yes?

821
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:44,355
One last thing.

822
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:47,597
- What is he doing?
- We need more amps
to light the house and the tent.

823
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:51,395
- It's cheaper
than bringing in a new line.
- In terms of the florals out front...

824
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,159
we're gonna color coordinate
with the swans, right?

825
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:56,032
- Swans?
- I think it'd be wonderful.
- Perfect.

826
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,151
- We're having swans?
- Franck thought it would be great...

827
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:00,919
to have swans waddling around
the tulip border, you know,
as the guests enter.

828
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:04,350
- It would be really sweet.
- Nina, we don't have a tulip border.
- You will.

829
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:07,759
How much is--

830
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:10,189
Mr Bonks,
ve huff problus.

831
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,356
Hanck does not vant
no vay to prepare chuckun.

832
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:16,632
- He doesn't what?
- Franck, does the tent connect
through here?

833
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:19,638
I've been meaning to fix that.
You have to push, then pull.

834
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:24,633
Oh.

835
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:27,479
Oh, now les not panic
about anything. Les see.

836
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:30,672
Oh. Oh, that-- Eww. That's only
a sem. We cun fix that.

837
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,995
Now, Mr Bonks, please,
about the seafoot.

838
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:35,429
Hanck vants to know
if it's hokay or not hokay.

839
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:41,032
No, Franck.
Tell Hanck it's not okay.

840
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:44,596
If I have to move out
all the furniture and add amps...

841
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:49,635
and repaint the walls and get
a new tux and pay for swans...

842
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:53,116
then I'd like
the "chipper" chicken.

843
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:58,030
- Is that clear?
- I understood the "chipper" part. Yeah.

844
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:13,037
Hokay. Dat's it. Hanck says
he will think about dis.

845
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:15,151
Now, we do not vant
to louse him.

846
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:19,956
He is a ganius, and
ve need his mand. Hokay? So.

847
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:23,914
I'll see vhat I can do.
Hanck? Hanck!

848
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,796
I'm fine.

849
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,440
Anyway, where were we? Oh.

850
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,437
- Yes.
- I see you're starting to lose it.

851
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:35,710
But I have one more question.
Very minor. I'll say it quickly.

852
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:38,832
Parking attendants. Four is comfortable.
Three is acceptable. Anything less...

853
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,474
- absolutely terrifies me.
- Two.

854
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:44,160
- Two.
- George--
- Two.

855
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:46,953
Hanck says if you vant the fowl,
he vasn't interested. He passes.

856
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:50,550
He-- He passes?
ls he gonna do our cake?

857
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:52,238
Hey, Dad. How's it going?

858
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:54,874
Hi. I came to get my sneakers.
I left them in Annie's room last night.

859
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,232
I was beginning to feel like I was
having an out-of-body experience.

860
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:01,430
I had to get out
of the house and fast.

861
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,191
Nina said as long as
I was escaping, would I mind...

862
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:10,880
escaping to the market
and picking up something for dinner?

863
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,151
Sure. That was all I needed.
A busy supermarket.

864
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:17,590
I needed to drive, mellow out,
get my mind off the wedding.

865
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:22,200
But mellowing out
was not in the cards.

866
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,914
Here we go.
Here we go. Yeah.

867
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:32,438
- Excuse me, sir. What are you doing?
- I'll tell you what I'm doing.

868
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:36,678
I want to buy eight hot dogs
and eight hot dog buns to go with them.

869
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:40,873
But no one sells eight hot dog buns.
They only sell twelve hot dog buns.

870
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,355
So I end up paying
for four buns I don't need.

871
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:46,313
So I am removing
the superfluous buns.

872
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:49,557
I-l'm sorry, sir, but you're gonna
have to pay for all twelve buns.

873
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,877
- They're not marked individually.
- Yeah.

874
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:57,232
And you wanna know why? Because some
big shot over at the wiener company...

875
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:00,670
got together with some big shot
over at the bun company...

876
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,756
and decided to rip off
the American public.

877
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:06,475
Because they think the American public
is a bunch of trusting nitwits...

878
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:09,751
- who'll pay for things they don't need
rather than make a stink.
- Get me security.

879
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:12,394
Well, they're not ripping off
this nitwit anymore...

880
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:14,988
because I'm not paying
for one more thing I don't need.

881
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:18,032
George Banks is saying no!

882
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,718
Who's George Banks?

883
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:24,435
Me!

884
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:27,233
Uh, why don't we just
calm down now, sir?

885
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:30,477
I'll tell you why "we" don't calm down.
Because you're not excited.

886
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:34,036
It takes two people for a "we"
to calm down, doesn't it?

887
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:38,392
Uh, that I don't know, sir. I'm just
the assistant manager of a supermarket.

888
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:43,310
But I'll tell you this. If you don't
pipe down and pay for those buns...

889
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:47,752
- I'm gonna call the police.
- Oh, right!

890
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,791
Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. Right.

891
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,319
- That's right.
- Hey.

892
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,237
- Right.
- Hey! Hey, come here!

893
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:54,713
- Uh-uh! Uh-uh!
- Come here!

894
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:56,717
Uh-uh! Uh-uh!

895
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:08,756
That was the low point.
Flipping out over four hot dog buns.

896
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,030
I couldn't figure out
why I'd gotten so nuts...

897
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:13,196
why the wedding had me so unglued.

898
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:16,437
Banks, your wife is here.

899
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:24,919
- Aren't you going to let me out?
- She wants to talk to you first.

900
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:27,952
- She wants to talk to me first?
- Thank you.

901
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:35,196
Hello, George.

902
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:37,515
Why do you look happy
to see me in here, Nina?

903
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:41,474
Happy? No, no, no.
I'm not happy, George.

904
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,477
You think I was happy to tell everyone
that I had to come...

905
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:46,114
down to the city jail and bail you out
for stealing hot dog buns?

906
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:48,800
- I wasn't stealing them--
- Ah!

907
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:51,718
- I was having a little--
- Ah!

908
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:53,717
I'm going to have to ask you
not to talk or I'll have to call...

909
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:56,354
Officer What's-his-name
over there.

910
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:00,953
You've been more
than I can handle, George.

911
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:03,514
Annie's wedding is not
a conspiracy against you.

912
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:07,349
It's just a wedding. People have them
every day in every country in the world.

913
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:11,234
I know it's going to be expensive,
but we don't go to Europe.

914
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:13,828
We don't own fancy cars.
I don't own expensive jewellery.

915
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:16,713
So we can afford
to have a big wedding.

916
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:18,478
Nina.

917
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:20,750
I'll get you out of here
on one condition, Banks.

918
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:24,919
That you agree to the following.
Now, repeat after me.

919
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:28,112
I, George Stanley Banks...

920
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,678
I, George Stanley Banks...

921
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:37,157
promise to pull it together
and act my age. Promise.

922
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,236
promise to pull it together
and act my age.

923
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:44,354
I will stop hyperventilating, rolling my
eyes, unbuttoning my top collar button.

924
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:48,951
- I don't unbutton my top collar--
- Oh yeah. No. You mean this bit, with--

925
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:51,310
- Stop hyperventilating...
- Hyperventilating.

926
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,192
- rolling my eyes, and, uh...
- Unbuttoning.

927
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:55,276
unbuttoning
my top collar button.

928
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,914
I will stop making faces in general,
and I will definitely stop...

929
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:00,554
telling everybody I meet
how much this wedding is costing.

930
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:04,673
I don't tell everyone
how much it costs!

931
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:07,837
- He told you, right?
- 250 a head.

932
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:11,157
Oh, well, thanks!

933
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:18,431
I will try to remember
my daughter's feelings.

934
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:24,351
And how with every roll of my eyes, I am
taking away a piece of her happiness.

935
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:27,677
I love you, Nina.

936
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:30,189
Just repeat the last part
for me, George.

937
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:32,038
I will try to remember
my daughter's feelings...

938
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:35,357
- That's right.
- and how with every roll of my eyes...

939
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:38,995
I am taking away
a piece of her happiness.

940
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:43,159
I love you too.
Let's go home, okay?

941
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,509
- No!
- Hey, I'm gonna hold ya here!

942
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:50,790
- Yes! Sweet!
- Come on, Matty. Let's go.

943
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,275
Plan "B," Matty. Plan "B."

944
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:55,868
Here we go! Hey!

945
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,036
Okay, I got ya! I got ya!

946
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:00,230
- Midget slam!
- All right!

947
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:03,079
Annie! Bryan! Look,
you got a present.

948
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,952
Our first present!
I can't believe it.

949
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:06,798
Oh, our second one
should be here any minute.

950
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:09,434
- Oh, wow. How do you know?
- Oh, my parents are bringing it over.

951
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:10,675
- Oh!
- Oh!

952
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:13,360
Oh, this is, uh, when we give
the presents. Uh, great. Uh, good.

953
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,471
- I'll be right back.
- Where's he goin'?

954
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:17,830
- Maybe he got a present for you.
- You know about this?

955
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:19,837
Uh, I haven't got a clue.

956
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:34,956
- Look at this!
- This is for us? Thank you so much!

957
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:39,950
Yikes. A whole car.

958
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:42,514
My dad's gotta see this!

959
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:50,752
Dad! Dad?

960
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:54,788
Dad, did you see
what the MacKenzies got us?

961
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:57,354
It's unbelievable. And you thought
you'd never have a new car.

962
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:00,313
I know! What's that?

963
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:04,956
It's nothing. It's just a gift
I was thinking of giving you guys.

964
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:08,629
You know, it's something you said
you didn't have but you wanted.

965
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:11,115
Can I see it?

966
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:13,629
Yeah, you know, it's--

967
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:18,436
It's not the big,
big gift, of course.

968
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:26,596
It's a cappuccino maker!

969
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:29,075
Supposed to be a good one.
That's what they said at the store.

970
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:33,079
It's, uh, top of the line.
Makes great foam.

971
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,475
I couldn't love anything more.

972
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,992
Goin' to the chapel and we're

973
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:51,113
- My feelings exactly.
- Gonna get married

974
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:54,869
Goin' to the chapel and we're

975
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,834
- Gonna get married
- Wow!

976
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:02,350
Gee, I really love you and we're

977
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:05,597
Gonna get married

978
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:10,714
Goin' to the chapel of love

979
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:15,795
Spring is here

980
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:19,435
The sky is blue

981
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:23,519
Whoa, birds all sing

982
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:27,997
- As if they knew
- No.

983
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:31,749
Today's the day

984
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:33,996
We'll say I do

985
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:38,796
And we'll never
be lonely any more

986
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:41,593
All right, Mr Banks.
Here you go.

987
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:45,030
- A 40-long. It's gorgeous
even on the hanger.
- Because we're goin' to the chapel

988
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:49,039
- Now this is an actual Giorgio Armani,
the real McCoy.
- And we're gonna get married

989
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:52,391
- Don't ask how I got it,
but here it is.
- Goin' to the chapel

990
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:57,389
And we're gonna get married

991
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:01,115
Gee, I really love you
and we're

992
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:04,312
Gonna get married

993
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:10,151
Goin' to the chapel of love

994
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:14,476
Bells will ring

995
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:19,913
The sun will shine, whoa

996
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:22,270
I'll be his

997
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:24,118
- Nina, we have great friends,
you know that?
- And he'll be mine

998
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:27,710
I mean, these are not
your run-of-the-mill salad bowls.
Theses are primo gifts.

999
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:30,673
- We'll love until
- As a matter of fact, I am so happy
we have decided to serve...

1000
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:35,157
- The end of time, and we'll never
- the very chic but exponsive seafoot
at our very foshionable wotting.

1001
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:37,555
- Be lonely anymore
- Ah! The beautiful bride! Good news!

1002
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:41,468
You have received another lovely,
too-good-to-be-true silver tea set.

1003
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:44,672
- What's the matter?
- Send it back.

1004
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:48,475
- Come on. What do you mean?
- Daddy, I'm not kidding!

1005
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:50,477
Send them all back.
The wedding's off!

1006
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:04,351
Anne? Annie?

1007
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:17,598
I'm sorry, Dad,
but I'm not gonna marry Bryan.

1008
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:21,190
Okay, okay. Whatever you want
is okay with us.

1009
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:25,154
I feel so awful,
after everything you guys have done.

1010
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:27,794
And now
I have to undo it all.

1011
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:33,070
Don't worry about it. These things
get cancelled all the time.

1012
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,077
Your mother and I can
take care of everything.

1013
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,077
Okay.

1014
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:45,151
What happened?

1015
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:52,229
- Another girl?
- No.

1016
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:58,310
- Now look at your shirt.
- Don't worry.

1017
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:01,591
No, it wasn't anything like that.

1018
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:06,032
It started out as nothing really.
He gave me a present.

1019
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:09,516
It's our eight-month anniversary
today, and he--

1020
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:13,474
He gave me-- Just look.

1021
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:21,356
He said it was for me,
for our apartment.

1022
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:23,630
Just look.

1023
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:33,630
It's a blender.

1024
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:36,479
Yeah. Exactly.

1025
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:43,273
I mean, I didn't want to act thrown
or anything, but inside I was.

1026
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:45,960
I mean, I thought something
for the apartment. Maybe--

1027
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:49,993
Maybe a new clock or a cool phone
or a great art book or something.

1028
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:53,157
But a blender?
I mean, what is this? 1958?

1029
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:55,874
Give the little wife a blender?

1030
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:00,516
I mean, it scared me, you know.
In terms of his expectations.

1031
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:03,438
Oh, I started to freak out,
and he asked me what was wrong.

1032
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:05,835
And I asked him what a gift like this
was supposed to be telling me.

1033
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:08,235
And he said, "Nothing,"
and I didn't believe him.

1034
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:12,558
And we got into this big fight.
And he said I was overreacting.

1035
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:16,992
And I said, "Why would I overreact?
Nobody in my family overreacts."

1036
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:20,430
And then he came up
with this totally absurd story...

1037
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:23,393
this completely outrageous lie,
and I'm looking at him...

1038
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:25,909
and I'm thinking,
"This man's a liar!"

1039
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:28,873
- What did he lie about?
- Oh...

1040
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,355
actually it was
something about you.

1041
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:34,233
Me?

1042
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:37,875
He said the day that you and Mom
went to go visit his folks--

1043
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,912
It-- This is just--
This is so ridiculous.

1044
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:44,555
He said that you were snooping
around his-- his dad's desk.

1045
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:47,274
And that you somehow found
his dad's bankbook--

1046
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:49,914
Oh, no, no. First he said you broke
some mirror in their bathroom.

1047
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:53,237
And then you found his dad's bankbook
and you somehow threw it in their pool!

1048
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:56,955
I mean, it's too ridiculous!
The man lies!

1049
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:59,230
Come in!

1050
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:02,871
Annie, Bryan's downstairs.

1051
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:06,072
- I don't want to see him.
- He looks awful.

1052
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:08,430
Good.

1053
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:10,869
Excuse me.

1054
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,309
I thought maybe I should help
smooth things over.

1055
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:15,476
So I took Bryan out for a drink.

1056
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:19,434
Thought we could
have a talk, man-to-man.

1057
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:22,393
But as I sat there and listened
to his side of the story...

1058
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:25,353
I realized this was
a golden opportunity.

1059
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:29,837
If I ever wanted to get rid
of Bryan MacKenzie, this was my chance.

1060
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:33,359
You know those banana shakes
she likes to make, right?

1061
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:36,472
Well, that's why I thought
she'd like a blender.

1062
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:40,149
I guess I can see her point. I mean,
a blender does suggest a certain...

1063
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:43,750
1950s reference
to sexual politics, but...

1064
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:48,271
I swear, it never entered
my consciousness at the time.

1065
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:51,915
- I believe you.
- You do?

1066
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:56,115
Would you tell Annie
that for me, Dad?

1067
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:59,232
This was where I was gonna
lower the boom.

1068
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:03,114
But instead, I looked into his
weepy eyes and found my self saying--

1069
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:07,552
- Sure, I'll tell her.
- Oh, good!

1070
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:11,070
'Cause I know whatever you say
she'll believe.

1071
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:13,111
Not only was I not getting rid
of the kid...

1072
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:16,118
I now found myself
talking him into staying.

1073
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:19,630
You know, Bryan,
Annie's a very passionate person.

1074
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:23,469
And passionate people tend
to overreact at time.

1075
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:28,037
Annie comes from a long line
of major overreactors.

1076
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:31,277
Me. I can definitely lose it.

1077
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:33,834
My mother. A nut.

1078
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:37,270
My grandfather.
Stories about him were legendary.

1079
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:42,072
The good news, however,
is that this overreacting...

1080
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:45,158
tends to get proportionately less
by generation.

1081
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:48,670
So, your kids could be normal.

1082
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:54,599
As if that wasn't enough,
I went on.

1083
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:58,508
But on the upside,
with this passion...

1084
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:01,393
comes great spirit
and individuality...

1085
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:05,559
which is probably
one of the reasons you love Annie.

1086
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:08,240
That's what
I love most about her.

1087
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:11,158
That's when it hit me
like a Mack truck.

1088
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:16,035
Annie was just like me,
and Bryan was just like Nina.

1089
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:18,390
They were a perfect match.

1090
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:26,316
Dad, I can't believe
you took him out. What did he say?

1091
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:28,829
I mean, you don't
have to tell me. What?

1092
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:31,599
Honey, I just spent
an hour with Bryan, and...

1093
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:33,756
believe me
when I tell you that...

1094
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:37,077
this gift says nothing about
how he feels about you.

1095
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:40,715
It's just a--
just a thing to put in the kitchen.

1096
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:43,798
He thought you might want to blend
something one day, and that's all.

1097
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:47,356
- And you believe that?
- Completely.

1098
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:52,110
He's-- He's downstairs now. His heart
is breaking. Please go see him.

1099
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:57,511
And also,
that story he told you...

1100
01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:00,108
about me and the bankbook
and the swimming pool?

1101
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:02,231
Yeah?

1102
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:10,797
- What?
- It's-- It's true.

1103
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:19,073
- Oh, Bryan.
- Oh, Annie.

1104
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:21,919
Oh.

1105
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:24,031
I am so sorry
about the blender.

1106
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:26,674
And I see your point. It w-- It w--
It was incredibly insensitive of me.

1107
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,995
Oh, no, it's okay. I want it.

1108
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:34,558
Oh, it's my first anniversary present.
I'm-- I'm so sorry
about calling you a worm.

1109
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:37,831
- My dad told me.
- That's-- When I thought I was never
gonna see you again, I mean--

1110
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:40,394
- If it wasn't for your father--
- I know. I know.

1111
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:42,511
- I love you.
- You too.

1112
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:49,112
Everything fine now?

1113
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:59,837
Good. I'll just, uh, uh--

1114
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:18,439
- Annie!
- Hi, Bryan. What's up?

1115
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:21,028
- Well, we made it to January.
- Is that for us?

1116
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:24,470
- It was the day before the big day.
- Sure. I'll be out in a sec.

1117
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:27,068
The Farmer's Almanac predicted this week
was going to be the coldest...

1118
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:29,714
L.A. had seen
in over half a century.

1119
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:32,798
But we were so busy,
none of us had time to notice.

1120
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:39,276
Franck! Franck.
Franck, Franck, Franck.

1121
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:43,718
Sure, yes. We'll do the whole--
You like it?

1122
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:45,717
Looks good, yeah.

1123
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:47,193
Right, together.

1124
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:51,192
Left, together.
Right, together.

1125
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:54,437
Left, together.
Right, together.

1126
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,915
Left--

1127
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:02,153
Right, together.
Left, together.

1128
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:04,396
Hey, Matty. You're up pretty late,
aren't ya?

1129
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:07,159
Yeah, I know.
I'm just practising.

1130
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:09,475
I wish I didn't have to
walk Mom down the aisle.

1131
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:11,830
Don't worry. You'll be great.

1132
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:15,157
Is it right, together, left
or left, together, right?

1133
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:17,794
Well, let's try it.
Let's see, we go...

1134
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:22,118
right, together,
left, together.

1135
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:26,313
Right, together,
left, together.

1136
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:28,237
Good.

1137
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:32,148
Matty, I'm sorry if I've been
preoccupied lately with this wedding.

1138
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:34,714
- It's okay.
- Yeah, but I have, haven't l?

1139
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:36,637
It's all right.
I understand.

1140
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:39,433
- Yeah, but--
- Yeah, you have.

1141
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:41,869
But I haven't felt
ignored or anything.

1142
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,072
Don't worry, Dad.
No permanent damage done.

1143
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:48,237
- Oh, good.
- It's really cute and cozy.

1144
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:50,476
And in a great neighborhood.
You'll see it.

1145
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:52,636
I am really excited.

1146
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:56,594
I've got all this packing to do,
and this room looks so different.

1147
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:00,310
It's gonna be weird,
isn't it?

1148
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:02,271
Just you, me
and Mom here now.

1149
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:09,479
Yeah. Come on.

1150
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:12,034
G'night, pal. Sleep tight.

1151
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:16,119
- Good luck tomorrow, Dad.
- Yeah, you too.

1152
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:18,196
- Annie?
- Yeah?

1153
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:21,471
- G'night.
- G'night, Matty. I love you.

1154
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,875
I love you too.

1155
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:38,875
Today I met the boy
I'm gonna marry

1156
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:43,755
He's all I've wanted
all my life and even more

1157
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:48,112
He smiled at me and
gee, the music started playing

1158
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:52,472
"Here Comes The Bride"
when he walked through the door

1159
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:58,515
Today I met the boy
I'm gonna marry

1160
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:03,634
The boy whose life and dream
and love I want to share

1161
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:08,117
For on my hand a band of gold
appeared before me

1162
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:11,915
The band of gold
I always dreamed I'd wear

1163
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:18,908
When we kissed
I felt the sweet sensation

1164
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:23,716
This time it wasn't
just my imagination

1165
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:28,470
Today I met the boy
I'm gonna marry

1166
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:33,435
He's just what I've been waiting for
Oh, yes

1167
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:37,951
With every kiss, oh
"This is it," my heart keeps saying

1168
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:40,435
Today I met

1169
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:45,156
The boy I'm going to marry

1170
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:38,199
- Did I wake you?
- No, no. I was up.

1171
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:40,276
So, what are you doing?

1172
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:42,470
I couldn't sleep.

1173
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:53,635
I just kept thinking about how this was
my last night in my bed, in my house.

1174
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:57,992
Kind of like
my last night as a kid.

1175
01:15:58,120 --> 01:15:59,997
I mean, I've lived here
since I was five.

1176
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:04,318
And I feel like I'm supposed
to turn in my key tomorrow.

1177
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:06,396
It was so strange,
packing up my room.

1178
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:10,354
You know how you've always trained me
never to throw anything away.

1179
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:13,950
So, like, I have all these
ratty stuffed animals...

1180
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:17,390
and yearbooks, my old retainer...

1181
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:21,354
all my old magic tricks.

1182
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:24,313
I've actually packed it all.

1183
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:29,195
I just didn't want
to let it go.

1184
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:32,756
I mean, I know I can't stay.

1185
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:37,274
But it's like
I don't want to leave.

1186
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:42,792
Well, that's the thing about life,
is, uh...

1187
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:44,956
the surprises.

1188
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:49,710
The little things that sneak up
on you and grab hold of you.

1189
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:55,553
- It still happens to me.
- Thanks.

1190
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:03,038
- What is this?
- I don't believe it.

1191
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:08,029
- Oh, my God! Talk about surprises.
- It hasn't snowed in L.A.
since I was nine.

1192
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:10,196
Mom's gonna die.

1193
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,753
What? What is that face?

1194
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:21,997
No. Nothing. I was--
I was just thinking.

1195
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:25,874
Oh, this is gonna end up
costing you more money.

1196
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,514
No.

1197
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:31,791
How I know I'll remember this moment
for the rest of my life.

1198
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:48,997
Whee!

1199
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:55,199
When you live in a city that hasn't
seen snow in 36 years...

1200
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:57,914
it's bound to cause a few problems.

1201
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:02,711
First, we panicked
and brought in extra heaters.

1202
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:06,071
But they were melting
the ice sculptures, so they had to go.

1203
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:07,349
- Right.
- Yeah?

1204
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:10,233
- All right. Back in the truck.
- Yeah.

1205
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:14,478
The florist had to thaw out our
newly planted tulips with a hair dryer.

1206
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:20,193
Franck and Howard shovelled our path
themselves at no extra charge.

1207
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:22,151
- Franck?
- Just keep shovelling! Don't stop!

1208
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:25,113
'Cause they're gonna be here, you know.

1209
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:28,550
And the swans spent the morning
in a lukewarm bath.

1210
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:33,672
Other than that, we were
almost running on schedule.

1211
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:39,191
- Nina, it's after 3:00!
- All I can say is thank God
snow is white.

1212
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:41,356
- It works. You know what I mean?
- It works.

1213
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:42,833
Franck, do you have
that needle and thread?

1214
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:44,552
Here you go, George.
We fix you right up.

1215
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:47,752
- Howard, you better go to the church!
- On my way.

1216
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:49,836
Uh-oh. I bring
the wrong kolor thread.

1217
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:52,349
I assumed you'd be wearing
a black tuxado.

1218
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:55,119
- It is a black tuxado.
- I don't think so, babe.

1219
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:58,630
This tux if nuffy blue.
No doubt about dat. Let me--

1220
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:01,718
What are you talkin' about?
Armani doesn't make a blue tuxedo.

1221
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:04,115
Armani don't also make polyaster.

1222
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:09,477
Franck, where are the cars?
We're supposed to be there by now.

1223
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:13,036
Where are dos cares?

1224
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:18,029
All right. Relax, honey.
Everything's going to be just fine.

1225
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:21,869
At least we know
they can't start without us.

1226
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:26,516
I knew I'd never be able to remember
what Nina wore that day.

1227
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:29,359
But I also knew I'd never forget
the way she looked.

1228
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:37,798
Nina.

1229
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:39,478
Thank you, George.

1230
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:41,875
You shouldn't look this beautiful.
It's not fair to the bride.

1231
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:46,710
- Cars is here!
- Huh?

1232
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:49,195
Matthew, frond and cendre!

1233
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:54,114
- Aw!
- Aw!

1234
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:58,514
Just kidding.

1235
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:02,189
- Oh, no.
- What did you do to your hair, honey?

1236
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:03,958
I gelled it. You don't like it?

1237
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:06,310
N-- Oh, no, no. I think it--
it looks-- yeah-- cool.

1238
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:08,351
- Very debonair, my boy.
- Thank you.

1239
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:10,835
- Okay, we'll go in the first car,
and you and Annie follow.
- Right.

1240
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:13,838
- George.
- Oh, I follow! l-- Anne!

1241
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:21,753
Annie?

1242
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:24,030
I'm ready. Come on in.

1243
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:37,278
- You look beautiful.
- Thanks.

1244
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:40,836
Okay. Let's get
this show on the road.

1245
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:02,550
- We're here!
- Oh! Oh, just look!

1246
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:06,036
- Hi. Oh, Mom.
- Line up, everyone.

1247
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:08,549
- Mother of the bride.
- Oh, George!

1248
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:11,717
Comin' through! Here we come.
Comin' through.

1249
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:14,274
- Left, together, right, together.
- Got it, Dad.

1250
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:16,789
- Let me see that.
- See?

1251
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:20,196
Let's do this. Okay?
I love you.

1252
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:23,357
- I love you too.
- Mother of the bride.
Mother of the bride. We've gotta go.

1253
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:25,710
- George.
- Let's go, everybody. Line up.

1254
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:28,308
It's time. It's time.
Mother of the bride.

1255
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:30,954
Come on, mother of the bride.
Here we go. I'm opening the doors.

1256
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:34,231
Natasha, haven't you peeked enough?
Here we go. Come on. Let's go.

1257
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:38,073
Shh. Okay.

1258
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:49,513
And left, right.
Very nice. Smile now.

1259
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:07,508
Right and left.

1260
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:12,191
Right and very nice and left.

1261
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:15,392
Right. Keep smiling.

1262
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:24,194
And left. Hey.

1263
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:40,677
This was the moment I'd been dreading
for the past six months.

1264
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:44,475
Well, actually,
for the past 22 years.

1265
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:59,116
- Hold on, Dad.
- Annie overwhelmed me.

1266
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:03,233
She was as calm and cool as
I'd ever seen her. Very un-Banks-like.

1267
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:09,750
Okay.

1268
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:35,796
Here you go.

1269
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:07,436
Dearly beloved, we are gathered
here together...

1270
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:10,757
in the presence of family,
friends and loved ones...

1271
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,871
for the purpose
of uniting in matrimony--

1272
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,355
All I could think of was the part
I had to play.

1273
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:19,951
Then suddenly I went blank. I had
one line, and I couldn't remember it.

1274
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:22,275
When the reverend said,
"Who presents this woman?"...

1275
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:26,154
was I supposed to say, "That's me,"
or was it, "l do"?

1276
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:28,635
- ...Forever hold your peace--
- I couldn't think. I felt every eye...

1277
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:32,036
in the place boring into the back
of my neck, waiting for me to screw up.

1278
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:34,276
- When suddenly, it was upon me.
- And so I now ask...

1279
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:37,995
who presents this woman
in holy matrimony?

1280
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:41,271
I do.

1281
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:46,429
Annie and Bryan, you have come here
today to join your hands--

1282
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:49,233
- "Who presents this woman?"
- Always remember...

1283
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:51,874
- This woman.
- this vow of marriage is most solemn...

1284
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,276
- But she's not a woman.
She's just a kid.
- should not be entered into lightly.

1285
01:24:55,400 --> 01:25:01,191
- And she's leaving us.
- With a deep realization of its
obligations and responsibilities.

1286
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:04,198
I realized at that moment that I was
never going to come home again...

1287
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:06,754
and see Annie
at the top of the stairs.

1288
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:08,916
Never going to see her again
at our breakfast table...

1289
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:11,713
in her nightgown and socks.

1290
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:14,718
I suddenly realized
what was happening.

1291
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:18,435
Annie was all grown up
and leaving us.

1292
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:21,711
And something inside
began to hurt.

1293
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:28,471
I, Bryan MacKenzie...

1294
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:30,431
I, Bryan MacKenzie...

1295
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:34,269
- take thee, Annie Banks...
- take thee, Annie Banks...

1296
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:37,437
- to be my wedded wife.
- to be my wedded wife.

1297
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:40,233
To love and to comfort
from this day forward.

1298
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:43,272
To love and to comfort
from this day forward.

1299
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:48,030
- I, Annie Banks...
- I, Annie Banks...

1300
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:50,879
take thee, Bryan MacKenzie...

1301
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:54,754
- take thee, Bryan MacKenzie...
- to be my lawful wedded husband.

1302
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:57,075
to be my lawful wedded husband.

1303
01:25:57,200 --> 01:25:59,475
To love and to comfort
from this day forward.

1304
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:02,478
To love and to comfort
from this day forward.

1305
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:05,239
The ring, please.

1306
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:17,514
With this ring as a token of my love
and affection, I thee wed.

1307
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:23,158
With this ring as a token of my love
and affection, I thee wed.

1308
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:29,189
Here, sweetie.

1309
01:26:34,120 --> 01:26:36,998
With this ring as a token
of my love and affection...

1310
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:39,190
I thee wed.

1311
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:43,154
With this ring as a token
of my love and affection, I thee wed.

1312
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:51,195
By virtue of the authority vested in me,
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

1313
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:53,834
You may kiss the bride.

1314
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:32,315
Well, she did it.

1315
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:36,115
And now, as my son said,
it was time to party.

1316
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:42,198
- Hi, how are you? Good to see you.
Don't you look great?
- Congratulations.
- Wonderful party.

1317
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:45,710
The house was busting at the seams.
Everywhere I looked, there were faces.

1318
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:48,593
Most of which, I might add,
I had never seen before.

1319
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:52,315
- George, I'd like you to meet the
Danish relatives. These are the Prowses.
- Hello!

1320
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:56,399
I met Bryan's Danish relatives,
who thanked me profusely
for flying them over.

1321
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:05,596
- Hi. How are you?
- Everyone was telling me
what a great party it was.

1322
01:28:05,720 --> 01:28:08,314
How beautiful the house looked.
They loved the flowers...

1323
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:10,510
the hors d'oeuvres, the swans.

1324
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:13,473
We even seemed to be getting away
with only two parking attendants.

1325
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:16,751
Everything was running smoothly,
except for one small detail.

1326
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:18,791
- Annie's very favorite uncle.
This is Ben Banks.
- I still hadn't kissed the bride.

1327
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:21,195
- Congratulations.
- Where's Annie?
- Annie. She's having her picture taken.

1328
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:22,469
- Hi, Ben.
- How are you, George?

1329
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:25,068
Yes. Ben's been
back in Connecticut.

1330
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:29,034
Okay, kids. Look at each other.
Very nice. Now, turn towards me, please.

1331
01:28:31,720 --> 01:28:33,915
I'm sorry, sir. All traffic
has to go through the front door.

1332
01:28:34,040 --> 01:28:36,713
Doris! It's so good to see you!
How are you?

1333
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:39,479
- Oh, could I have one of those?
- Sorry. Just sold my last one.

1334
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:42,239
Hey, a button. It's navy.
This must be yours.

1335
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:47,910
We're moving into the tent now.
Dinner is served.

1336
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:50,270
This way to the tent, please.

1337
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:56,353
- Uh, let's--
I think we have to go back in--
- Ann-- Annie!

1338
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:58,357
As well, l--

1339
01:29:02,120 --> 01:29:06,716
It was unbelievable.
I had never seen a line form so fast.

1340
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:10,310
It was as if they knew
what the food was costing me.

1341
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:15,030
Finally,
I made it into the tent.

1342
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:23,236
I was ready to relax and taste
the food I'd been hearing about...

1343
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:25,032
for the past five months, when--

1344
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:29,233
Dad! Dad! There's some cops out front,
and they want to talk to you!

1345
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:32,033
- Cops?
- I've heard. We'll handle dis togather.

1346
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:34,037
I got George. Ve're on our vay.

1347
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:36,230
Come on, George.
Pick it up. Pick it up.

1348
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:40,672
One-Adam-seventy, roger.
Standby.

1349
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:43,189
Let me handle this, George.
Give me your wallet.

1350
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:45,117
Stop!

1351
01:29:45,240 --> 01:29:48,994
- Adam-30, disregard.
- What is this?

1352
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:53,113
- See, Cameron? I told ya.
- Wow!

1353
01:29:53,240 --> 01:29:55,629
Just try to smile. That's all.

1354
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:57,876
- This your house?
- Me?

1355
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:01,549
Yeah, you. In the blue tux.

1356
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:06,515
- Yes. Yes, it is.
- Do you have a permit for parking
200 cars in this street?

1357
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:11,839
Vell, the-- the problem is, Officer,
dat we are supposed to haf
four parking attandants.

1358
01:30:11,960 --> 01:30:14,315
- Uh, but two got de flu.
- Well, you better get...

1359
01:30:14,440 --> 01:30:17,273
all these cars off this street
before the fire marshall gets here.

1360
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:19,436
Fine, fine. Any sugjoostions
what we do with them?

1361
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:22,472
I don't care what you do with them.
Just have them off this street
within the next 30 minutes.

1362
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:25,876
Vill do, sir. Ve'll take care of it.
You're not to worry, okay?

1363
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,639
- Franck? Where are you? The cake--
- Uh, uh, George. They need me inside.

1364
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:31,320
Uh, the big moment.
The keck is being wheeled out!

1365
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:35,149
- I-- I-- I'll handle this.
- I'm on my vay!

1366
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:37,840
Where're we gonna get
a couple extra drivers?

1367
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:48,799
Hey, baby, I'm your man
Turn around, you'll see

1368
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:51,070
I may not stand tall
and I don't talk neat

1369
01:30:51,200 --> 01:30:54,112
But I'm gonna
win your love for me

1370
01:30:57,440 --> 01:30:59,829
Yes!

1371
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:04,158
Watch out, baby, here comes your man
Lookin' cool to me

1372
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:06,717
Whoa!

1373
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:14,116
By the way,
great wedding, Mr Banks.

1374
01:31:14,240 --> 01:31:16,879
And don't worry!
I didn't eat anything!

1375
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:21,676
- That makes two of us.
- I got sunshine

1376
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:24,553
On a cloudy day

1377
01:31:24,680 --> 01:31:27,592
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

1378
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:30,917
When it's cold outside

1379
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:34,476
I've got the month of May

1380
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:41,351
I guess you'll say

1381
01:31:41,480 --> 01:31:45,678
What can make me feel this way

1382
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:49,315
- It's my girl
- My girl, my girl

1383
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:52,238
I will feel aglow

1384
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:57,593
Just thinkin' of you

1385
01:31:57,720 --> 01:32:01,315
And the way you look

1386
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:03,556
Tonight

1387
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:14,399
- I know.
- Oh, but you're lovely

1388
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:18,479
With your smile so warm

1389
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:22,832
And your cheeks so soft

1390
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:26,191
There is nothing for me

1391
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:30,029
But to love you

1392
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:34,670
Just the way you look

1393
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:36,836
Tonight

1394
01:32:43,880 --> 01:32:47,759
Just the way you look

1395
01:32:50,160 --> 01:32:51,752
- Tonight
- Well, I had to admit...

1396
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:54,678
the wedding appeared to be
a complete success.

1397
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:57,712
Now, all I needed to make me happy
was a dance with the bride.

1398
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:01,276
- It's time.
- Ladies and gentlemen...

1399
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:05,916
in just a few moments,
Mrs Annie Banks-MacKenzie will be
tossing her bouquet in the foyer.

1400
01:33:06,040 --> 01:33:08,235
- And then she's off to Hawaii.
- Let's go in there. Oh, sorry.

1401
01:33:08,360 --> 01:33:11,432
- Excuse me. Thank you.
- This I was not going to miss.

1402
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:13,994
- Comin' through.
- The mob was headed
through the living room...

1403
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:17,396
- so I decided to take a shortcut.
- Sorry.

1404
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:19,272
- Excuse me. Thank you.
- Great wedding, George!

1405
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:21,675
- Had a lovely time.
- Thanks. Excuse me.
- Great party, George.

1406
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:23,995
Hurry up!

1407
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:30,071
Whoa! Ay-yi-yi-yi!

1408
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:33,716
Whoo!

1409
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:47,395
- Where's my dad?
- I-- I-- I don't know.

1410
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:52,116
- I haven't seen him.
- Watch it. Behind you.

1411
01:33:52,240 --> 01:33:54,196
Excuse me.

1412
01:33:56,840 --> 01:34:00,150
- Should I throw it?
- Yeah! Yes!

1413
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:05,832
He missed it.

1414
01:34:09,160 --> 01:34:11,390
- Bye-bye!
- Let us through. Let us--

1415
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:18,959
Bye!

1416
01:34:19,080 --> 01:34:21,036
Goodbye, Charlie!

1417
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:23,037
Bye, Bryan!

1418
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:26,479
- Bye!
- Bye!
- Thanks.

1419
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:29,239
- Bye!
- Have fun!

1420
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:36,556
She was gone.
My Annie was gone...

1421
01:34:36,680 --> 01:34:39,797
and I was too late
to say goodbye.

1422
01:34:59,240 --> 01:35:00,559
When the last guest was gone...

1423
01:35:00,680 --> 01:35:03,513
and the last glass of champagne
had been drunk...

1424
01:35:03,640 --> 01:35:05,870
we surveyed the damage.

1425
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:18,278
It's funny how empty a house
can suddenly get, isn't it?

1426
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:22,996
Yeah. I'm sorry you didn't get a chance
to say goodbye to her, George.

1427
01:35:23,120 --> 01:35:26,112
Oh, that's all right.

1428
01:35:26,240 --> 01:35:29,152
But, you know, I think she's going
to be really happy.

1429
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:32,955
Oh, yeah. Sure.

1430
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:46,599
- Hello?
- Dad!

1431
01:35:46,720 --> 01:35:49,393
Hi! Where are you?

1432
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:51,317
At the airport.
Our plane's about to take off...

1433
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:53,795
but I couldn't leave
without saying goodbye.

1434
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:56,832
Thank Mom for everything, okay?

1435
01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:59,315
And Dad...

1436
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:01,351
I love you.

1437
01:36:01,480 --> 01:36:04,631
I love you very much.

1438
01:36:04,760 --> 01:36:06,637
I love you too, sweetheart.

1439
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:10,753
Thanks for calling.
And have a great honeymoon.

1440
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:14,998
Thanks. I will. Bye.

1441
01:36:15,720 --> 01:36:19,030
Someday

1442
01:36:19,160 --> 01:36:23,517
When I'm awfully low

1443
01:36:23,640 --> 01:36:27,269
- When the world is cold
- That was Annie.

1444
01:36:27,400 --> 01:36:30,472
- Oh.
- I will feel aglow

1445
01:36:30,600 --> 01:36:35,674
Just thinkin' of you

1446
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:39,509
And the way you look

1447
01:36:39,640 --> 01:36:41,596
Tonight

1448
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:52,471
Oh, but you're lovely

1449
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:56,673
With your smile so warm

1450
01:36:56,800 --> 01:37:00,793
And your cheeks so soft

1451
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:04,390
There is nothin' for me

1452
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:09,230
But to love you

1453
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:12,796
Just the way you look

1454
01:37:15,160 --> 01:37:18,550
Tonight
