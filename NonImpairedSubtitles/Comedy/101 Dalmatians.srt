00:00:05,472 --> 00:00:07,133
Digga-digga-dog
Digga-digga-dog

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,969
- Digga-digga-dog, digga-digga-dog
- Bow-wow-wow

3
00:00:09,075 --> 00:00:12,010
Digga-digga-dog
Digga-digga-dog, dog, dog

4
00:00:12,112 --> 00:00:13,306
- You dog, you!
- Bow-wow-wow

5
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:15,506
Digga-digga-dog
Digga-digga-dog

6
00:00:15,615 --> 00:00:17,515
- Digga-digga-dog, digga-digga-dog
- Bow-wow-wow

7
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:21,747
- Digga-digga-dog
Digga-digga-dog, dog, dog
- You dog, you!

8
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,823
Bow-wow-wow
Yippee-yo, yippee-yay

9
00:00:23,923 --> 00:00:26,414
Ain't that
the man in the moon

10
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,585
Dancin' over our heads

11
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:31,664
Atomic dog

12
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:36,896
Yeah, while all good dogs
are asleep in their beds

13
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:40,166
-Atomic dog
- Ohh-oh-oh

14
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:42,002
Smiling in their dreams

15
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:45,839
At the crazy things
people do

16
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:48,243
Yeah

17
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:50,976
And when you think
you've fooled them

18
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:53,985
Who'll make a fool
out of who

19
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:55,884
Whoa-ohh-ohh

20
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:57,320
You dog, you!

21
00:00:57,424 --> 00:01:00,587
Don't be believin'

22
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:01,557
Bow-wow-wow

23
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:04,255
Looks are deceivin'

24
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:05,626
- You dog, you!
- Bow-wow-wow

25
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,929
Don't be believin'

26
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:09,933
Bow-wow-wow

27
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:12,596
Looks are deceivin'

28
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:14,002
You dog, you!

29
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:15,938
Bow-wow-wow
Yippee-yo, yippee-yay

30
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:18,840
You think
you're on top of the game

31
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:20,810
You got a lot to learn

32
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:24,213
-Atomic dog
- Yeah, you do

33
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:27,081
When life hangs tough

34
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:29,178
Take a dog-legged turn

35
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:32,554
-Atomic dog
- Yeah, uh-huh-huh

36
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:35,093
People, they think
they're so cool

37
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:38,221
If they throw you a bone

38
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:39,730
Hey

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,230
Wait till they discover

40
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:45,804
You've got some tricks
of your own

41
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:48,066
Ah, hey, hey-ey-ey

42
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:49,471
You dog, you!

43
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:52,773
Don't be believin'

44
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:53,777
Bow-wow-wow

45
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,314
Looks are deceivin'

46
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:57,906
- You dog, you!
- Bow-wow-wow

47
00:01:58,017 --> 00:02:01,180
Don't be believin'

48
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:02,185
Bow-wow-wow

49
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:05,121
Looks are deceivin'

50
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:06,590
- You dog, you!
- Bow-wow-wow

51
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:09,753
Bow-wow-wow

52
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:12,457
-A-bow-wow-wow
-Spotted dog, spotted dog

53
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:14,795
Where have you been

54
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:18,359
I've been to London
to look at the queen

55
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,837
Can you tell
a spotted story

56
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,908
Yes, I can

57
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:26,501
I saw a dog
who was walkin' a man

58
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:27,807
Oww!

59
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:29,245
- You dog, you!
- Bow-wow-wow

60
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,749
Don't be believin'

61
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:33,375
- Oh-ohh-ohh
- Bow-wow-wow

62
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,647
Looks are deceivin'

63
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:37,586
- Hey, you dog, you
- Bow-wow-wow

64
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,624
Digga-digga-dog, digga-digga-dog

65
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:41,626
Digga-digga-dog, digga-digga-dog

66
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:43,855
- Don't give me no more rules
- Digga-digga-dog, digga-digga-dog

67
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:45,624
Digga-digga-dog, digga-digga-dog

68
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:46,960
Dog, dog

69
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:48,966
You dog, you!

70
00:02:55,274 --> 00:02:58,675
My client is not
a laboratory animal, Dr. Pavlov.

71
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:01,941
Your client
wants out of prison, Mr. Torte...

72
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:05,449
and with my behavior
control therapy...

73
00:03:05,551 --> 00:03:07,451
freedom is...

74
00:03:21,767 --> 00:03:24,668
I have patented
a humane cocktail...

75
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:27,102
of electric shock treatment...

76
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,840
aversion therapy, hypnosis...

77
00:03:33,946 --> 00:03:37,313
drugs...

78
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,941
and plenty
of green vegetables.

79
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:48,221
But, of course,
the real challenge remains.

80
00:03:48,327 --> 00:03:52,627
I mean, this is a prison,
not a pet shop.

81
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,792
And I don't
represent animals in court.

82
00:03:55,901 --> 00:03:59,337
- Dr. Pavlov, my client...
- Is cured.

83
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:20,689
Brush up your Swedish,
Dr. Pavlov.

84
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:24,456
This could be
your Nobel prize!

85
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:28,495
- Cruella De Vil.
- Do call me Ella.

86
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,933
Cruella sounds so cruel.

87
00:04:31,036 --> 00:04:35,905
Ms. De Vil, I am releasing you into
the custody of the probation office.

88
00:04:36,008 --> 00:04:39,603
You will perform 500 hours
of community service.

89
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:43,910
Mr. Torte, your client is,
I believe, a wealthy woman.

90
00:04:44,016 --> 00:04:47,213
After my exorbitant fees,
milord...

91
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:51,221
her assets stand
at a mere £8 million.

92
00:04:51,323 --> 00:04:55,987
Then you will be bound over to keep
the peace to the sum of £8 million.

93
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:58,996
If forfeited,
the money will be donated...

94
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:01,999
to the dogs' homes
of the borough of Westminster.

95
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:05,195
Which means,
if you repeat the offense...

96
00:05:05,304 --> 00:05:08,000
your entire fortune
will go to the dogs.

97
00:05:22,054 --> 00:05:23,851
Alonso.

98
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:26,891
My ever-loyal valet.

99
00:05:26,992 --> 00:05:29,620
My only visitor...

100
00:05:29,728 --> 00:05:34,631
stuttering sweetly on the far, far side
of the bulletproof glass.

101
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,639
Oh, Miss De Vil,
I've waited for this day.

102
00:05:40,739 --> 00:05:44,197
I hope it's not too presumptuous,
but I've brought you a g-g-gift.

103
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:47,609
Oh, Alonso, how considerate.

104
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,311
Oh!

105
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,319
Oh!

106
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:04,154
I think I'll call him Fluffy.

107
00:06:06,298 --> 00:06:09,096
Oh, he's smiling at me.

108
00:06:10,769 --> 00:06:12,600
Oh, what a sweet voice.

109
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,607
Wrong side, Alonso.

110
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:20,338
Come, Fluffy.
Mummy will drive.

111
00:06:29,421 --> 00:06:31,889
I told you
you wouldn't believe the truth.

112
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:35,619
The dog ate your pay stubs.

113
00:06:36,995 --> 00:06:41,056
Ewan, can't you do
a little better than that?

114
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:43,566
I was abducted by aliens.

115
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:47,469
Put me out at Piccadilly,
they did. It was a...

116
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:51,065
How can you work here? I can't
even keep me own story straight.

117
00:06:59,384 --> 00:07:02,217
Listen.
I won't say it again.

118
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:04,789
No pay stub, no probation.

119
00:07:07,893 --> 00:07:10,157
Dog shelter suits me.

120
00:07:10,262 --> 00:07:13,197
- l-I think I found me self.
- Mm-hmm.

121
00:07:13,298 --> 00:07:16,893
Here's a snap of me
with the dogs.

122
00:07:17,002 --> 00:07:20,403
Uh, that's the boss.
He's a top bloke.

123
00:07:20,505 --> 00:07:22,370
You'd love him.

124
00:07:22,474 --> 00:07:26,035
Ah. Told ya.

125
00:07:26,144 --> 00:07:28,078
Drooler got a hold of it.

126
00:07:31,183 --> 00:07:33,981
Ewan, this is an IOU.

127
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:36,919
- Yeah, well, we're a bit tight
on funds at the moment.
- Chloe, this is...

128
00:07:37,022 --> 00:07:39,217
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

129
00:07:39,324 --> 00:07:41,417
Ewan was just off.

130
00:07:42,527 --> 00:07:44,757
All right. Thanks, miss.

131
00:07:46,231 --> 00:07:48,495
Uh, next week, then?

132
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,364
Yes. With pay stubs.
Am I being clear?

133
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,370
Uh, supremely.

134
00:07:53,472 --> 00:07:55,372
Um, keep the photo.

135
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:59,207
You do put the fear of God
into them, Chloe.

136
00:07:59,311 --> 00:08:01,541
Which is why
I've chosen you to...

137
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,047
- Is it...
- Line three!

138
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:05,616
- Hello?
- Is it?

139
00:08:05,717 --> 00:08:07,742
Yes! Stay there!

140
00:08:07,853 --> 00:08:11,846
Keep breathing,
and I'll be there in a second.

141
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:19,629
Goodness.

142
00:08:19,731 --> 00:08:21,392
Hurry!

143
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,900
- See you soon!
- Chloe! Chloe!

144
00:08:24,002 --> 00:08:25,902
You forgot this.

145
00:08:26,004 --> 00:08:27,995
What... Ah.

146
00:08:34,579 --> 00:08:37,980
Oh, for Pete's sake.
Are you two at it again?

147
00:08:38,082 --> 00:08:40,050
Kevin, how many times
have I had to tell you...

148
00:08:40,151 --> 00:08:44,645
it's pointless for you humans
to play tug-of-war against us dogs.

149
00:08:47,925 --> 00:08:51,452
Come on, Drooler!
Hit him with both barrels!

150
00:08:53,231 --> 00:08:55,131
Yes! You got it!

151
00:08:55,233 --> 00:08:59,431
He's ours! He's down!
He's... He's getting up!

152
00:09:01,105 --> 00:09:03,972
I always say,
if you can't stand the heat, cheat!

153
00:09:05,343 --> 00:09:07,675
Hurry, boys! Get in there!

154
00:09:07,778 --> 00:09:10,338
We dogs need to stick together.

155
00:09:13,551 --> 00:09:15,985
All right, Chomp, sock it to him!

156
00:09:18,756 --> 00:09:21,122
Can you dig it, Digger?

157
00:09:27,932 --> 00:09:31,197
Let's get ready to tumble!

158
00:09:33,938 --> 00:09:37,567
Hey! Hey! That's not fair!

159
00:09:37,675 --> 00:09:41,008
Yes, it is!
All's fair in tug-of-war!

160
00:09:41,112 --> 00:09:46,209
I took you misfits in out
of the goodness of my heart,
and this is how you repay me?

161
00:09:46,317 --> 00:09:50,014
That's pathetic, Kev. How many times
you gonna fall for that one?

162
00:09:53,824 --> 00:09:56,054
I managed to get another week out
of my probation officer, boss.

163
00:09:57,228 --> 00:09:59,992
Think she quite fancies me.

164
00:10:02,133 --> 00:10:04,192
Come on, boys. It's grub time.

165
00:10:13,644 --> 00:10:15,544
Where'd you get that dog food?

166
00:10:15,646 --> 00:10:17,307
Didn't pinch it, did you?

167
00:10:17,415 --> 00:10:20,350
No. I'm done with all that.

168
00:10:24,322 --> 00:10:26,222
There you go.

169
00:10:26,324 --> 00:10:28,224
- Fill your belly.
- Come on.

170
00:10:29,327 --> 00:10:31,227
Good girl.

171
00:10:33,364 --> 00:10:35,662
Okay, who's next?

172
00:10:43,607 --> 00:10:45,404
Hey.

173
00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:48,603
Fill 'er up, Kev.
I'm a very hungry dog.

174
00:10:50,448 --> 00:10:52,348
Oh, thank you.

175
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:57,410
- Hey! Hey, wait!
Come back with my grub!
- Come on, Waddles worth. Come on.
Today's the day, Waddles worth.

176
00:10:57,521 --> 00:11:01,958
Fly up to your house, and then I'll
feed you. Come on, Waddles worth!
Come on! Fly! You can do it.

177
00:11:02,059 --> 00:11:07,156
No, I've told you once, I've told you
a hundred times: we dogs can't fly!

178
00:11:07,264 --> 00:11:09,289
See? Now stand aside, birdbrain.

179
00:11:11,002 --> 00:11:14,904
Save some for tomorrow. I don't know
where our next meal's coming from.

180
00:11:15,006 --> 00:11:19,807
Me mum always said, "When the heart
hopes, hope comes knocking."

181
00:11:20,711 --> 00:11:23,441
"'Eart 'opes"?

182
00:11:24,915 --> 00:11:27,145
Hope comes knocking.

183
00:11:33,357 --> 00:11:36,121
What? Evicted? But you said...

184
00:11:36,227 --> 00:11:39,458
You shouldn't believe
what people say. I don't.

185
00:11:39,563 --> 00:11:42,464
You can't turn
all these dogs loose in the city.

186
00:11:42,566 --> 00:11:45,933
- Give us another chance.
- I'm not the one
running a charity here.

187
00:11:46,037 --> 00:11:48,801
Maybe you can
get away with this...

188
00:11:56,547 --> 00:11:59,448
You and your mangy pack
are out of here tomorrow!

189
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,984
You'd better not leave
any of this junk about!

190
00:12:02,086 --> 00:12:05,385
Next time I'll bite your bum,
you smelly little git.

191
00:12:12,096 --> 00:12:15,429
Don't worry.
Everything'll be all right.

192
00:12:23,507 --> 00:12:26,999
Oh, Dottie,
they're absolutely beautiful.

193
00:12:27,111 --> 00:12:29,011
Aren't they, Dipstick?

194
00:12:39,857 --> 00:12:42,451
You must be very proud.

195
00:13:00,243 --> 00:13:02,609
You are an odd one,
aren't you?

196
00:13:03,847 --> 00:13:06,179
There you go.

197
00:13:08,051 --> 00:13:10,986
Now you should get some rest.

198
00:13:11,087 --> 00:13:12,987
Come on, Dipstick.

199
00:13:40,717 --> 00:13:43,277
It's smaller than I remember.

200
00:13:43,386 --> 00:13:46,355
I k-kept everything
just as you l-left it.

201
00:13:46,456 --> 00:13:48,856
Oh, come, Fluffy.

202
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,858
We'll share a bath.

203
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,690
An interminable soak...

204
00:13:53,796 --> 00:13:56,264
scented with lavender...

205
00:13:56,366 --> 00:13:58,527
and a drop of Sumatran...

206
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:07,770
Never mind. I think I'll enjoy
doing a little dusting.

207
00:14:09,412 --> 00:14:11,937
Oh, Fluffy, a bath...

208
00:14:12,048 --> 00:14:13,310
followed by a nap...

209
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:16,613
submerged
in feather pillows and satin...

210
00:14:19,722 --> 00:14:23,783
Alonso! Fur! It's everywhere!

211
00:14:23,893 --> 00:14:27,624
Lock them away!
Bury them beyond sight and memory!

212
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:31,325
- Even the Mongolian
pony skin trousers and the...
- Now!

213
00:14:57,727 --> 00:14:59,194
And this!

214
00:15:16,913 --> 00:15:18,813
Is it safe?

215
00:15:23,152 --> 00:15:25,985
Yes, it's s-safe.

216
00:15:28,317 --> 00:15:30,842
I do not believe it.

217
00:15:30,953 --> 00:15:33,854
How could they release
that... that...

218
00:15:35,557 --> 00:15:39,550
You know, I pity the poor
probation officer that has to look af...

219
00:15:39,661 --> 00:15:42,926
Oh, no.
No, it's not possible.

220
00:15:44,032 --> 00:15:45,932
Oh!

221
00:15:52,407 --> 00:15:54,432
Well, I refuse.

222
00:15:54,543 --> 00:15:56,170
I'm not doing it.

223
00:15:57,779 --> 00:15:58,803
What?

224
00:16:05,621 --> 00:16:07,953
You remember her,
don't you?

225
00:16:08,056 --> 00:16:11,685
You remember
what she almost did to you.

226
00:16:13,595 --> 00:16:15,187
Dipstick.

227
00:16:20,469 --> 00:16:23,370
Okay.

228
00:16:23,472 --> 00:16:27,238
I'll do it for you.
And for the family.

229
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:44,615
- Miss De Vil.
- Yes?

230
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,019
You're five minutes late.
It's a good start.

231
00:16:49,164 --> 00:16:52,691
Well,
perhaps your clock's fast.

232
00:16:52,801 --> 00:16:54,792
I'm your probation officer,
Chloe Simon.

233
00:16:54,903 --> 00:16:56,803
Yes, of course you are.

234
00:16:56,905 --> 00:16:59,237
And we're going to be
such friends.

235
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,171
Mmm. Friends.

236
00:17:01,276 --> 00:17:04,143
You are going to help me be a useful
member of society, aren't you?

237
00:17:04,245 --> 00:17:07,840
Find me
a little niche somewhere?

238
00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:10,645
Could you manage something
with puppy dogs?

239
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,544
I see you more as a coal miner...

240
00:17:13,655 --> 00:17:15,555
or something
in the sewers, perhaps.

241
00:17:15,657 --> 00:17:17,284
Ah, I see.

242
00:17:17,392 --> 00:17:19,519
Oh! You have doggies?

243
00:17:19,627 --> 00:17:22,528
Yes, and I don't want you
looking at them.

244
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:25,030
I'm sorry. l...

245
00:17:25,133 --> 00:17:28,398
Listen, can we just be
sensible about this?

246
00:17:28,503 --> 00:17:31,097
Yes! Let's.

247
00:17:31,206 --> 00:17:33,265
Well, must dash.

248
00:17:33,374 --> 00:17:36,036
Bye.

249
00:17:41,474 --> 00:17:43,601
This is your last chance,
Mr. Button.

250
00:17:43,709 --> 00:17:46,234
When the press sees what
you're doing to these poor dogs...

251
00:17:46,345 --> 00:17:48,779
you'll be the most hated man
in London.

252
00:17:48,881 --> 00:17:50,781
I don't see any press...

253
00:17:50,883 --> 00:17:53,784
but I can guarantee
the bailiff is on his way.

254
00:17:53,886 --> 00:17:56,320
Right!
That's it, Mr. Buttocks!

255
00:17:56,422 --> 00:17:58,185
That one's vicious,
he is!

256
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:00,191
They're here!

257
00:18:02,562 --> 00:18:06,555
Everyone on your best behavior.
Pick up your signs.

258
00:18:09,335 --> 00:18:10,996
Come on.

259
00:18:11,103 --> 00:18:13,333
- Here!
- Here we are outside
the Second Chance...

260
00:18:13,439 --> 00:18:15,634
- You're just in time.
- Excuse me. I'm just trying to...

261
00:18:15,741 --> 00:18:19,006
No, no, no, the dog shelter's over here.
These rescued dogs are being evicted...

262
00:18:19,111 --> 00:18:21,011
Just one moment!
This man has no right...

263
00:18:21,113 --> 00:18:22,978
- Here she comes!
- Who she comes?

264
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:34,891
- Cruella De Vil?
- Cruella! Cruella! Cruella!

265
00:18:34,994 --> 00:18:36,757
- Cruella!
- Cruella!

266
00:18:36,862 --> 00:18:39,092
Please. Call me Ella.

267
00:18:39,198 --> 00:18:41,666
Ella! Ella!

268
00:18:41,767 --> 00:18:43,826
Well.

269
00:18:43,936 --> 00:18:46,837
This place and I
were made for each other.

270
00:18:46,939 --> 00:18:49,100
- Is it yours?
- No, it's mine.

271
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,005
- And he...
- Alonso.

272
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:53,010
Buy the dump.

273
00:18:53,112 --> 00:18:55,876
And give him a little extra
for a tie.

274
00:18:56,815 --> 00:18:59,613
So, could you tell us how
Cruella De Vil became plain Ella?

275
00:18:59,685 --> 00:19:03,815
Well, I certainly can. It was all
thanks to Dr. Pavlov and his therapy.

276
00:19:03,922 --> 00:19:06,322
And do you really think that you,
a convicted dognap per...

277
00:19:06,425 --> 00:19:08,825
are the right person
to run this establishment?

278
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:11,452
Second Chance Dog Shelter
says it all.

279
00:19:11,563 --> 00:19:15,397
And I think I deserve
a second chance too. Don't you?

280
00:19:15,501 --> 00:19:17,401
No, I do not.

281
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:20,470
She tricked me!

282
00:19:25,001 --> 00:19:27,469
It's the Red Baron,
king of the sky!

283
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:29,765
Stop playing
and give me a hand here.

284
00:19:30,874 --> 00:19:33,342
Hey, look. Another volunteer.

285
00:19:33,443 --> 00:19:36,571
See, Ewan? There are
good-hearted people everywhere.

286
00:19:40,884 --> 00:19:42,408
Beautiful good-hearted people.

287
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:44,885
That's my probation officer!

288
00:19:44,988 --> 00:19:47,013
What, that's
your probation officer?

289
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:52,687
- Are you Kevin Sheperd?
- Yes. Yes, I'm Kevin...

290
00:19:52,796 --> 00:19:55,026
And you call yourself
a dog lover?

291
00:19:55,131 --> 00:19:57,292
- Well, yes, I do. I am.
- He does. He is.

292
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,129
I'll get to you, Ewan.

293
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:02,267
I'm Chloe Simon.

294
00:20:02,372 --> 00:20:04,840
Cruella De Vil's
probation officer.

295
00:20:04,941 --> 00:20:07,102
Oh! She's in the back.

296
00:20:09,212 --> 00:20:11,373
Is there some problem?
I mean, uh...

297
00:20:11,481 --> 00:20:13,779
Ooh. Excuse us, Chomp.

298
00:20:13,883 --> 00:20:15,976
I mean, Miss De Vil,
she seems devoted to...

299
00:20:16,086 --> 00:20:18,782
Nice bird!

300
00:20:18,888 --> 00:20:21,288
- You are a nice bird.
- I'm not a bird.

301
00:20:21,391 --> 00:20:23,791
He means you.
Where are your manners?

302
00:20:23,893 --> 00:20:26,794
- Buried in the yard with my bone.
- This is...

303
00:20:26,896 --> 00:20:29,888
- Um...
- Chloe. Chloe Simon.

304
00:20:29,999 --> 00:20:31,489
Chloe, meet Waddles worth.

305
00:20:31,601 --> 00:20:33,501
- He's a rottweiler.
- Hello.

306
00:20:33,603 --> 00:20:36,697
That's funny, because
he looks like a macaw.

307
00:20:36,806 --> 00:20:39,036
Trust me. He's a rottweiler.

308
00:20:39,142 --> 00:20:43,374
You know, I don't think I trust anyone
who knowingly puts Cruella De Vil
anywhere near dogs.

309
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,540
Well, yes, but she's changed.

310
00:20:46,649 --> 00:20:50,016
- People like Cruella don't change.
- Of course they do.

311
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,886
That's why I started Second Chance.
I knew what it was like to need one.

312
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:56,652
And the same goes for dogs. Eh?

313
00:20:59,763 --> 00:21:01,594
Take Chomp here, for example.

314
00:21:01,698 --> 00:21:05,361
He chewed through three postmen
before I rescued him.
Now he wouldn't hurt a flea.

315
00:21:05,468 --> 00:21:09,928
And Digger, he was banned from every
park in London as a menace to roses.

316
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:11,939
And Drooler...

317
00:21:13,143 --> 00:21:16,237
Well, Drooler hasn't
really changed much.

318
00:21:18,181 --> 00:21:20,809
- Those are dogs.
- Oh, but dogs are people too.

319
00:21:22,285 --> 00:21:24,185
- But Cruella is...
- Changed.

320
00:21:33,196 --> 00:21:35,528
Who's washing who, Alonso?

321
00:21:36,933 --> 00:21:40,425
Now, hair
must be a statement...

322
00:21:40,537 --> 00:21:43,438
a reflection
of our inner life.

323
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,440
Color is important,
of course...

324
00:21:45,542 --> 00:21:48,067
but texture is vital.

325
00:21:51,047 --> 00:21:52,947
Voila!

326
00:21:53,049 --> 00:21:55,381
Oh, darling, darling.

327
00:21:55,485 --> 00:21:57,385
It's you.

328
00:21:57,487 --> 00:22:00,388
- Do you like it?
- I'll be keeping my eye on her.

329
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:02,788
I hope so.

330
00:22:09,465 --> 00:22:11,092
Cruella De Vil

331
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:15,801
- Three!
- Cruella De Vil

332
00:22:15,905 --> 00:22:18,237
Cruella De Vil

333
00:22:18,341 --> 00:22:21,674
Just hearing her name
used to make you feel ill

334
00:22:21,778 --> 00:22:25,305
Now suddenly she's
drippin' with good will

335
00:22:25,415 --> 00:22:29,408
Can this be Cruella De Vil

336
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:31,350
A heartwarmin' laugh

337
00:22:31,454 --> 00:22:33,217
Instead of a scream

338
00:22:33,323 --> 00:22:35,291
She's practically human

339
00:22:35,391 --> 00:22:37,052
Or so it would seem

340
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,652
As playful as a puppy in the snow

341
00:22:40,763 --> 00:22:44,290
That's not the Cruella we know

342
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,493
Oh, remember when she lived

343
00:22:46,603 --> 00:22:48,662
Just to be rotten

344
00:22:48,771 --> 00:22:52,434
How she loved to frighten
the little tots

345
00:22:52,542 --> 00:22:54,305
Who thought she could be kind

346
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:56,037
Respectful and refined

347
00:22:56,145 --> 00:22:59,114
Has the lady
really changed her spots

348
00:22:59,215 --> 00:23:00,546
Oh, Lord

349
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:02,982
Oooh-ooh, oooh-ooh
Oooh-ooh, oooh-ooh, ooh

350
00:23:03,086 --> 00:23:05,213
Cruella De Vil

351
00:23:05,321 --> 00:23:08,119
Now check this out
You know what

352
00:23:08,224 --> 00:23:11,660
She gave up her bark
but will she still bite

353
00:23:11,761 --> 00:23:13,524
What's wrong with this picture

354
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:15,495
It doesn't look right

355
00:23:15,598 --> 00:23:18,499
Unfortunately
only time will tell

356
00:23:18,601 --> 00:23:20,865
If Cruella, I mean, Ella

357
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:25,100
Is from heaven or hell
Ooh, yeah

358
00:23:26,869 --> 00:23:29,269
And now BBC 2
is proud to present...

359
00:23:29,371 --> 00:23:33,774
the third part in our series,
What Makes Big Ben Tick?

360
00:23:50,226 --> 00:23:52,956
Turn down the television, quick!

361
00:23:59,602 --> 00:24:02,867
What a unique sound pattern.

362
00:24:02,972 --> 00:24:04,098
Very loud.

363
00:24:04,206 --> 00:24:06,140
That would be Ben on the telly.

364
00:24:07,576 --> 00:24:09,203
Yes.

365
00:24:09,311 --> 00:24:12,803
It must have jolted
their brain waves back into...

366
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:16,745
This mustn't get out.

367
00:24:16,852 --> 00:24:20,310
Do you hear me?
It never happened.

368
00:24:29,898 --> 00:24:31,160
What are you doing?

369
00:24:31,267 --> 00:24:33,462
You're... Yes.

370
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:37,664
And this is Domino.

371
00:24:37,773 --> 00:24:41,265
Little Dipper's easy because his
tail is exactly like his daddy's.

372
00:24:42,244 --> 00:24:45,077
- And I know Oddball
because she doesn't have any...
- Shh, shh!

373
00:24:46,181 --> 00:24:50,675
I don't want her to be sensitive
about her lack of, um...

374
00:24:50,786 --> 00:24:52,014
S-P-O-T-S.

375
00:24:52,121 --> 00:24:54,681
Oh. Is that normal at her age?

376
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:57,588
Well, like everything else
about her...

377
00:24:59,495 --> 00:25:01,019
it is a bit...

378
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:02,628
odd.

379
00:25:07,436 --> 00:25:10,872
Hello? Hello?
Is that you, Nigel?

380
00:25:10,973 --> 00:25:13,806
I know you're there.
I can hear you breathing.

381
00:25:13,909 --> 00:25:15,774
Oh, dear. Will you take them
up to your office for a while?

382
00:25:15,878 --> 00:25:17,903
'Cause I just keep
staring at them...

383
00:25:18,013 --> 00:25:22,211
and I'm falling dreadfully behind
with my paperwork, as you can see.

384
00:25:22,318 --> 00:25:23,785
Yes, I can see.

385
00:25:23,886 --> 00:25:27,322
It's probably just as well
with Miss De Vil coming in.

386
00:25:27,423 --> 00:25:31,723
- Cruella?
- Y-Yes. She asked to change her
apppointment. I thought you knew.

387
00:25:31,827 --> 00:25:34,990
Come on, Oddball,
Little Dipper, Dipstick.

388
00:25:35,097 --> 00:25:37,292
Quick, quick, quick, quick!

389
00:25:39,168 --> 00:25:41,068
Cruella De Vil, that wretched...

390
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:43,798
- Philanthropist?
- Cruella, I didn't realize...

391
00:25:43,906 --> 00:25:46,466
Oh, please, please call me Ella.

392
00:25:46,575 --> 00:25:49,635
Now, Chloe, you can't stop me.

393
00:25:49,745 --> 00:25:52,976
It's my duty to demonstrate
against a fur fashion show.

394
00:25:53,082 --> 00:25:57,314
And it's my duty to inform you
that if you go anywhere near fur,
I'll put you straight back in prison.

395
00:25:57,419 --> 00:26:00,252
Won't you even let me heckle
that monstrous Le Pelt?

396
00:26:00,356 --> 00:26:03,848
- No.
-Just a teensy-weensy heckle?

397
00:26:03,959 --> 00:26:06,757
You know... murderer!

398
00:26:12,091 --> 00:26:13,615
Round two!

399
00:26:16,329 --> 00:26:18,957
Knockout!

400
00:26:20,733 --> 00:26:23,099
Body blow! Body blow!

401
00:26:23,202 --> 00:26:25,397
Bonus fall.

402
00:26:25,505 --> 00:26:27,803
Round three!

403
00:27:45,484 --> 00:27:47,452
I have so much to atone for.

404
00:27:54,627 --> 00:27:56,652
I'm seeing spots.

405
00:28:07,106 --> 00:28:08,471
Dr. Pavlov!

406
00:28:10,142 --> 00:28:12,167
Oddball!

407
00:28:15,681 --> 00:28:18,172
- Grab my legs! Grab my legs!
- What...

408
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,513
Oddball!

409
00:28:35,568 --> 00:28:37,763
How did you get out?

410
00:28:43,476 --> 00:28:45,239
Are these your lovely dogs?

411
00:28:45,344 --> 00:28:48,711
Yes. Are you all right?
Dipstick, shh, please!

412
00:28:52,318 --> 00:28:56,186
I remember you as a puppy.

413
00:29:03,062 --> 00:29:05,292
Why don't I come back later.

414
00:29:05,398 --> 00:29:08,196
I'm feeling a little...

415
00:29:08,301 --> 00:29:09,199
chilly.

416
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:05,215
Um, wouldn't you be
more c-comfortable in the c-car?

417
00:30:09,495 --> 00:30:13,124
Ella?
Not Ella. Ella's gone.

418
00:30:13,232 --> 00:30:15,962
And Cruella's back!

419
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:30,305
Pull! Pull!

420
00:30:30,415 --> 00:30:33,578
Stand aside, worm.

421
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:51,802
Oh, mummy's home,
and I'll never leave you again!

422
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:54,429
Oh, yes! Oh, hello!

423
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,633
Oh, yes!

424
00:31:02,581 --> 00:31:07,018
Oh! Why do I feel incomplete?

425
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:08,677
What could be missing
from my life?

426
00:31:08,787 --> 00:31:10,687
Cruella De Vil, who has it all!

427
00:31:10,789 --> 00:31:13,952
The softest, the rarest,
the whitest, the blackest...

428
00:31:14,059 --> 00:31:17,051
the scrappiest,
the sportiest, the...

429
00:31:17,162 --> 00:31:19,392
- Hmm?
- Of course.

430
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:23,357
Where is it? Where?

431
00:31:23,468 --> 00:31:26,369
Where is it? Oh, there it is.

432
00:31:27,806 --> 00:31:31,708
My dalmatian puppy coat.

433
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:34,040
The coat of dreams.

434
00:31:34,146 --> 00:31:36,046
The ultimate fur coat...

435
00:31:36,148 --> 00:31:39,208
that was denied me
by that canine cabal...

436
00:31:39,318 --> 00:31:42,378
for which I have lost
three years of my life!

437
00:31:43,488 --> 00:31:44,477
Alonso!

438
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:48,253
- We are going to make them pay.
- Oh, yes! How much?

439
00:31:49,928 --> 00:31:52,590
Dipstick, she called him.

440
00:31:52,698 --> 00:31:54,598
Ah, what fiendish justice.

441
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:58,602
He escaped me, but I shall wreak
my vengeance on the next generation.

442
00:31:58,704 --> 00:32:01,195
S-Sounds w-wonderful.

443
00:32:01,306 --> 00:32:03,206
Alonso, I need you.

444
00:32:03,308 --> 00:32:04,775
I'm yours.

445
00:32:04,876 --> 00:32:08,744
Furnish yourself with a torch.
a large sack and rubber-soled shoes.

446
00:32:08,847 --> 00:32:11,213
Meanwhile, I need a furrier.

447
00:32:11,316 --> 00:32:13,375
And I know just where to find him.

448
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:17,081
Freak out

449
00:32:17,189 --> 00:32:19,020
Le freak, c'est chic

450
00:32:19,124 --> 00:32:20,591
Freak out

451
00:32:20,692 --> 00:32:21,954
Le freak, c'est chic

452
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,391
Aww, freak out

453
00:32:24,496 --> 00:32:26,088
Le freak, c'est chic

454
00:32:26,198 --> 00:32:29,725
Freak out
Le freak, c'est chic

455
00:32:29,835 --> 00:32:33,202
-Aww, freak out
- Look at me in this big spotlight

456
00:32:33,305 --> 00:32:37,742
I'll make this one magical night

457
00:32:37,843 --> 00:32:39,708
I am fierce

458
00:32:39,811 --> 00:32:41,005
And we are fabulous

459
00:32:41,113 --> 00:32:45,049
Freak out, so fabulous
So fierce

460
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:46,777
- Freak out
-So beautiful

461
00:32:46,885 --> 00:32:48,409
-So beautiful
-So freaky

462
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,249
- Freak out
-So fabulous

463
00:32:50,355 --> 00:32:52,823
-So fabulous
-So hip

464
00:32:52,924 --> 00:32:54,448
- Freak out
-So beautiful

465
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,459
-So beautiful
-So freaky

466
00:32:56,561 --> 00:32:58,961
Yeah, yeah, yeah

467
00:32:59,064 --> 00:33:00,861
Some kind of love

468
00:33:00,966 --> 00:33:03,491
Ah, freak out

469
00:33:08,674 --> 00:33:12,132
Murderer! Murderer!

470
00:33:16,948 --> 00:33:18,643
Killers!

471
00:33:21,453 --> 00:33:23,944
- Come on, you.
- You're nicked!

472
00:33:29,928 --> 00:33:32,488
No! No!

473
00:33:32,597 --> 00:33:35,065
- Monsieur Le Pelt! Monsieur Le Pelt!
- Get out!

474
00:33:35,167 --> 00:33:38,227
Animals! They are all animals!

475
00:33:38,336 --> 00:33:41,100
- They have no class!
- Ooh! But, monsieur...

476
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:47,135
- Leave me alone!
- No... No...

477
00:33:49,881 --> 00:33:52,543
Not here!

478
00:33:57,889 --> 00:33:59,550
Forgive me.

479
00:33:59,658 --> 00:34:02,855
My idiots didn't recognize you.

480
00:34:04,129 --> 00:34:06,154
Only two minions to abuse?

481
00:34:06,264 --> 00:34:10,633
Oh, Jean-Pierre,
the world is so unfair.

482
00:34:12,637 --> 00:34:16,004
Get out! You are unfit
to look upon this goddess of fashion!

483
00:34:16,108 --> 00:34:18,508
Out! Out!

484
00:34:20,746 --> 00:34:22,646
Cruella De Vil...

485
00:34:22,748 --> 00:34:26,878
my idol, my inspiration,
at my show.

486
00:34:31,623 --> 00:34:34,319
I am so sorry
for the demonstrators.

487
00:34:34,426 --> 00:34:37,361
Demonstrators?
I thought they were critics.

488
00:34:40,532 --> 00:34:42,432
Go away!

489
00:34:44,402 --> 00:34:46,495
Jean-Pierre...

490
00:34:46,605 --> 00:34:51,065
you've come such a long way
from poaching weasels.

491
00:34:51,176 --> 00:34:53,235
And you, out of prison at last.

492
00:34:55,347 --> 00:34:57,838
Yes. Terrible experience, prison.

493
00:35:00,185 --> 00:35:03,018
Who are you, little man?
And what are you doing in my trailer?

494
00:35:03,121 --> 00:35:06,022
- You shouldn't have brought them
in here, you idiot!
- But l...

495
00:35:06,124 --> 00:35:08,024
He's with you!

496
00:35:11,263 --> 00:35:14,494
- What is this?
- Your salvation, Jean-Pierre.

497
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:17,329
Monsieur Le Pelt
has clearly run out of ideas.

498
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:20,370
I propose...

499
00:35:22,908 --> 00:35:24,671
- an alliance...
- Mmm?

500
00:35:24,776 --> 00:35:27,472
between Monsieur Le Pelt
and the house of De Vil.

501
00:35:28,113 --> 00:35:32,311
- You have an idea in the bag?
- Oh, Jean-Pierre.

502
00:35:32,417 --> 00:35:36,217
Together,
you and I will make a coat...

503
00:35:36,321 --> 00:35:39,722
so soft, so luxurious,
so practical in any weather...

504
00:35:39,825 --> 00:35:43,727
so bad that we'll rip the veils
off the eyes of fashion...

505
00:35:43,829 --> 00:35:46,855
and write our names
in the pantheon of stars.

506
00:35:47,566 --> 00:35:50,592
Of course. From "poopies."

507
00:35:50,702 --> 00:35:54,934
Ah, not just any "poopies."

508
00:35:58,176 --> 00:36:00,144
" Poopies" with...

509
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:07,980
Spots.

510
00:36:12,824 --> 00:36:15,224
Hey, wait for me!

511
00:36:18,063 --> 00:36:19,963
Enjoy the show.

512
00:36:21,399 --> 00:36:23,765
One adult, three dogs
and one bird, please.

513
00:36:23,868 --> 00:36:25,927
Oy, I'm a dog, mate.
Four dogs.

514
00:36:26,037 --> 00:36:28,437
- Four dogs.
- Well, look who's here.

515
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:30,440
Blimey! I'm seein' spots!

516
00:36:30,542 --> 00:36:32,442
Hello, Kevin.

517
00:36:32,544 --> 00:36:35,445
- Chloe! Are you, uh...
- Yeah, I'm going.

518
00:36:35,547 --> 00:36:38,448
- And are these your dalmatians?
- Yeah.

519
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:41,451
This is Digger, Chomp and Drooler.

520
00:36:41,553 --> 00:36:44,351
You call that a bark?

521
00:36:44,456 --> 00:36:47,016
This is a bark.

522
00:36:47,125 --> 00:36:50,026
That's right.
Go hide behind Mummy.

523
00:36:50,128 --> 00:36:54,622
And... Oddball.
He's not gonna hurt you.

524
00:36:54,733 --> 00:36:57,133
- Your change, sir.
- Oh. Thank you.

525
00:36:59,404 --> 00:37:02,601
- Don't you count your change?
- Well, why should I?

526
00:37:06,911 --> 00:37:09,812
- Now it all makes sense.
- What?

527
00:37:09,914 --> 00:37:12,940
How you could actually believe
that Cruella De Vil had changed.

528
00:37:13,051 --> 00:37:14,951
She has changed.

529
00:37:15,053 --> 00:37:17,783
Shh! The show's gonna start.

530
00:37:17,889 --> 00:37:19,857
Let's just enjoy the show.

531
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:22,491
Let's.

532
00:37:22,594 --> 00:37:26,621
- Hello, everybody!
- Hello, Mr. Punch!

533
00:37:26,731 --> 00:37:28,494
Hello, everybody!

534
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,397
Hello, Judy!

535
00:37:30,502 --> 00:37:33,562
- Give us a kiss.
- Everybody would laugh at us!

536
00:37:33,671 --> 00:37:36,071
- Wouldn't you, everyone?
- No!

537
00:37:36,174 --> 00:37:38,506
All right, one kiss. Ready?

538
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:41,238
Oh, you are awful!

539
00:37:41,346 --> 00:37:43,246
There's a dog around here today.

540
00:37:43,348 --> 00:37:47,751
- If you see a dog, will you
call out and tell us, please?
- Yes!

541
00:37:47,852 --> 00:37:50,184
- I won't be long then. Bye-bye!
- Bye!

542
00:37:50,288 --> 00:37:52,882
I don't see any dog. Where is it?

543
00:37:54,959 --> 00:37:56,517
Oh, dear.

544
00:37:56,628 --> 00:37:58,493
What is it?

545
00:37:58,596 --> 00:38:00,496
Oddball's obsessed with...

546
00:38:01,633 --> 00:38:03,498
S-P-O-T-S.

547
00:38:03,601 --> 00:38:05,728
- Spots?
- Shh!

548
00:38:05,837 --> 00:38:07,771
What? What'd I do?
I just said "spots."

549
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:09,840
Help! Help!
Help! Help! Oh!

550
00:38:11,042 --> 00:38:13,033
Oh, no!

551
00:38:13,144 --> 00:38:16,375
Help, help! Help! Help!

552
00:38:28,927 --> 00:38:30,258
Oddball, no!

553
00:38:33,064 --> 00:38:35,464
Follow that dog!

554
00:38:40,605 --> 00:38:41,594
What's that?

555
00:38:41,706 --> 00:38:43,697
Oy! They've got balloons!

556
00:38:43,808 --> 00:38:46,208
- Oddball! Stop!
- Get 'em back here!

557
00:38:46,311 --> 00:38:49,371
Where is that dog?
Hold on! We're coming!

558
00:38:54,385 --> 00:38:56,478
- Waddles worth.
- Oddball!

559
00:38:56,588 --> 00:38:59,785
Now's your chance. You fly up there
and just cut a few strings.

560
00:38:59,891 --> 00:39:02,587
- Not all of them!
- Right, just a few!
Come on, Waddles worth!

561
00:39:02,694 --> 00:39:05,595
- You can do it! Fly!
- No!

562
00:39:05,697 --> 00:39:09,098
Let go of my paw, you twit!
I told you I couldn't fly!

563
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,498
- Honestly!
- Don't worry. I'll go.

564
00:39:14,105 --> 00:39:17,506
Hey, hey, what you doing?
Hey, get off...

565
00:39:34,792 --> 00:39:36,020
Got her.

566
00:39:42,433 --> 00:39:43,832
Oddball.

567
00:39:43,935 --> 00:39:45,527
Oh.

568
00:39:45,637 --> 00:39:48,538
- Oh, Kevin,
I don't know how to thank you.
- Oops.

569
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,164
Uh, how about dinner?

570
00:39:51,943 --> 00:39:53,843
Sorry?

571
00:39:55,113 --> 00:39:57,013
I was inviting you to dinner.

572
00:40:00,451 --> 00:40:02,351
Dinner would be nice.

573
00:40:07,958 --> 00:40:11,052
A coat
to make the world "shuvver."

574
00:40:11,162 --> 00:40:13,722
"Shudder." "Shutter"?

575
00:40:13,831 --> 00:40:15,389
- Shudder?
- Sh...

576
00:40:15,499 --> 00:40:17,399
- Shiver?
- Exactement.

577
00:40:17,501 --> 00:40:19,230
Genius!

578
00:40:19,336 --> 00:40:20,735
Yes, but...

579
00:40:21,639 --> 00:40:22,867
I need...

580
00:40:22,973 --> 00:40:26,067
a special something...

581
00:40:26,177 --> 00:40:29,738
for three special puppies.

582
00:40:34,685 --> 00:40:37,654
Too dressy? Too dressy.

583
00:40:37,755 --> 00:40:41,589
Too stuffy.
Too small. Too blue.

584
00:40:41,692 --> 00:40:44,593
Dottie, I've got nothing to wear.
Please help me.

585
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:48,597
What's that?

586
00:40:49,633 --> 00:40:51,533
Dottie, are you sure?

587
00:40:51,635 --> 00:40:54,331
It's completely see-through. Look.

588
00:40:54,438 --> 00:40:56,906
Oddball.
Yeah, that's a sweater.

589
00:40:57,007 --> 00:40:59,407
But...

590
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:01,341
What a fantastic idea!

591
00:41:01,445 --> 00:41:03,345
Thank you!

592
00:41:03,447 --> 00:41:05,381
Thanks, Oddball.

593
00:41:06,083 --> 00:41:07,880
My brilliance astounds me.

594
00:41:07,985 --> 00:41:09,919
No. No.

595
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,921
- We should add
the "poopies" to the hem.
- Oh, you wouldn't dare.

596
00:41:13,023 --> 00:41:14,923
But this is
last year's length!

597
00:41:15,025 --> 00:41:17,721
If Cruella De Vil draws it,
it defies length.

598
00:41:20,297 --> 00:41:22,231
No. No!

599
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,527
No...

600
00:41:28,272 --> 00:41:29,569
What?

601
00:41:29,673 --> 00:41:32,107
Forty dalmatian puppies...

602
00:41:32,209 --> 00:41:35,701
sh-shipped off to Paris...

603
00:41:35,813 --> 00:41:37,280
to h-his shop.

604
00:41:37,381 --> 00:41:39,872
- Not enough.
- We need 102.

605
00:41:39,984 --> 00:41:43,385
This time I want
a hooded spotted puppy coat.

606
00:41:43,487 --> 00:41:46,888
- Hooded spotted p-puppy coat?
- " Hooded spotted poopie coat?"

607
00:41:46,991 --> 00:41:49,425
But 99 puppies
would make a lovely coat.

608
00:41:49,527 --> 00:41:53,429
- It's not all that easy to steal...
- Steal? Who said anything about steal?

609
00:41:53,531 --> 00:41:56,762
What did you think, Le Pelt,
that we'd have time to breed them?

610
00:41:56,867 --> 00:41:58,767
Skinning is one thing...

611
00:41:58,869 --> 00:42:00,769
but stealing...

612
00:42:00,871 --> 00:42:03,203
Oh, stop whining.

613
00:42:03,307 --> 00:42:06,834
I have a perfectly good idiot
to take the fall.

614
00:42:06,944 --> 00:42:08,935
Not you, Alonso. Another idiot.

615
00:42:11,247 --> 00:42:14,512
On, Dasher, on, Dancer,
on, Digger, on, Drooler!

616
00:42:14,617 --> 00:42:19,577
Look at me! I'm Rudolph,
the red-nosed rein-dog
with a present for Miss Oddball.

617
00:42:20,156 --> 00:42:21,589
Hello?

618
00:42:21,691 --> 00:42:24,091
I'll be right out, Kevin.

619
00:42:24,194 --> 00:42:26,094
Take your time.

620
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,599
Oh, right.

621
00:42:31,701 --> 00:42:34,795
Chomp's brought his favorite video.
Is that all right?

622
00:42:34,904 --> 00:42:38,806
- Is it suitable for the children?
- Yes, it's absolutely fine.

623
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,780
Is everything all right?

624
00:42:46,449 --> 00:42:48,212
Yes. Beautiful.

625
00:42:52,255 --> 00:42:56,055
Um, Waddles worth,
he's brought a present for Oddball.

626
00:42:56,159 --> 00:42:59,856
Yeah, about time. This thing
was gettin' heavy. Hang on, pup.

627
00:42:59,963 --> 00:43:03,057
Keep your spots on...
Sorry. You don't have any.

628
00:43:03,166 --> 00:43:04,531
Here you go. There.

629
00:43:09,005 --> 00:43:11,030
Come on, show us.

630
00:43:13,143 --> 00:43:15,202
Mr. Puppeteer and I
came to an agreement.

631
00:43:15,311 --> 00:43:19,213
Oh, Kevin, thank you.
It's brilliant.

632
00:43:20,917 --> 00:43:22,817
Come here, you.

633
00:43:29,626 --> 00:43:33,528
- Well, I think it's a success.
- Looking good, girl!

634
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:36,997
Looking... Oh, no!
Oddball's got no underwear!

635
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:40,536
Look away, children!
Turn a blind eye!

636
00:43:50,713 --> 00:43:54,240
Excuse me, young lady.
Is this spot taken?

637
00:44:04,828 --> 00:44:06,728
I can see we're not needed.

638
00:44:08,364 --> 00:44:13,597
As soon as the video's over,
straight to bed for the children.
No more telly.

639
00:44:13,703 --> 00:44:16,433
- Bye.
- Be good.

640
00:44:18,975 --> 00:44:20,875
Anybody wanna order takeout?

641
00:44:22,145 --> 00:44:25,114
So, where was I? Oh, yes.

642
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:30,551
I started the shelter,
and we were going down for the
third time when Cruella stepped in.

643
00:44:30,653 --> 00:44:32,985
- Her again.
- Yes.

644
00:44:33,089 --> 00:44:36,581
But did you know that
if she ever goes back to dog napping...

645
00:44:36,693 --> 00:44:40,595
that all her millions will go
straight into the dogs' homes
of the borough of Westminster?

646
00:44:40,697 --> 00:44:43,393
Yes, I did. It's in her file.

647
00:44:44,968 --> 00:44:46,868
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

648
00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:49,871
- But how did you know that?
- She told me.

649
00:44:49,973 --> 00:44:51,440
And did you know...

650
00:44:51,541 --> 00:44:55,307
that Second Chance is the only
dog shelter in the borough?

651
00:44:56,279 --> 00:44:57,746
You're joking.

652
00:44:57,847 --> 00:45:00,577
Can you imagine what Drooler
would do with £8 million?

653
00:45:02,185 --> 00:45:04,085
Now, tell-a me,
what's-a you pleasure?

654
00:45:04,187 --> 00:45:06,781
A la carte? Dinner?

655
00:45:08,358 --> 00:45:11,759
Aha. Okay. Hey, Joe!

656
00:45:11,861 --> 00:45:16,764
Butch, he says he wants
two spaghetti speciale...

657
00:45:16,866 --> 00:45:18,493
heavy on the meats-a-ball.

658
00:45:18,601 --> 00:45:21,434
Tony, dogs-a don't-a talk!

659
00:45:21,538 --> 00:45:25,702
- He's-a talk-a to me!
- Okay, he's-a talk-a to you.
You the boss.

660
00:45:25,808 --> 00:45:28,606
Mama mia.

661
00:45:29,712 --> 00:45:31,304
Now here you are.

662
00:45:31,414 --> 00:45:34,474
The best-a spaghetti in-a town.

663
00:45:50,033 --> 00:45:53,298
Oh, this is the night

664
00:45:53,403 --> 00:45:57,032
It's a beautiful night

665
00:45:57,140 --> 00:46:03,978
And we call it bella notte

666
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:07,311
Look at the skies

667
00:46:07,417 --> 00:46:10,978
They have stars in their eyes

668
00:46:11,087 --> 00:46:18,152
On this lovely bella notte

669
00:46:18,261 --> 00:46:20,786
Side by side

670
00:46:20,897 --> 00:46:24,060
With your loved one

671
00:46:24,167 --> 00:46:31,096
You'll find enchantment here

672
00:46:31,207 --> 00:46:35,610
The night will weave
its magic spell

673
00:46:35,712 --> 00:46:41,548
When the one you love is near

674
00:46:41,651 --> 00:46:47,248
For this is the night

675
00:46:47,357 --> 00:46:51,885
And the heavens are right

676
00:46:51,995 --> 00:46:54,657
On this lovely

677
00:46:54,764 --> 00:47:00,930
Bella notte

678
00:47:19,055 --> 00:47:21,990
Shh, shh, shh!
Get in the sack!

679
00:47:23,726 --> 00:47:25,956
Come on. Go. Get in.

680
00:47:48,284 --> 00:47:52,186
Oh, Lassie... Oh.

681
00:47:52,288 --> 00:47:55,746
Oh! It was a dream.

682
00:47:55,858 --> 00:47:57,086
Darn it.

683
00:47:59,262 --> 00:48:01,287
l, uh, had a great time.

684
00:48:03,132 --> 00:48:05,032
So... So did I.

685
00:48:08,771 --> 00:48:11,934
Oh, kiss her, for heaven's sake,
while we're still young.

686
00:48:13,376 --> 00:48:15,276
Look, l, uh...

687
00:48:15,378 --> 00:48:18,279
know you don't believe
in second chances...

688
00:48:18,381 --> 00:48:20,781
but, uh...

689
00:48:20,883 --> 00:48:23,283
do you believe in second dates?

690
00:48:25,421 --> 00:48:27,651
I do, a-actually.

691
00:48:29,926 --> 00:48:31,553
Good.

692
00:48:31,661 --> 00:48:33,492
Great.

693
00:48:34,731 --> 00:48:36,631
Good night.

694
00:48:43,005 --> 00:48:45,337
Well, at least
he's good-looking.

695
00:48:56,018 --> 00:48:57,952
Dogs.

696
00:48:59,255 --> 00:49:02,019
This is the night

697
00:49:02,125 --> 00:49:05,583
- It's a beautiful night
- Bye.

698
00:49:05,695 --> 00:49:07,890
And they call it

699
00:49:07,997 --> 00:49:11,899
Bella notte

700
00:49:13,102 --> 00:49:15,263
Look at the skies

701
00:49:15,371 --> 00:49:16,929
They have stars in their eyes

702
00:49:18,173 --> 00:49:21,540
You know, Dipstick,
he's a lot like you.

703
00:49:21,643 --> 00:49:24,305
Sweet and solid...

704
00:49:24,412 --> 00:49:26,846
funny without meaning to be.

705
00:49:32,587 --> 00:49:35,021
- Hello?
- There are "poopies."

706
00:49:35,123 --> 00:49:37,489
- " Poopies"?
- At Second Chance "poop" shelter.

707
00:49:37,592 --> 00:49:39,651
- What?
- Poor little dalmatian "poopies."

708
00:49:39,761 --> 00:49:42,161
- Dalmatians?
- Oui. Second Chance "poopie" shelter.

709
00:49:42,264 --> 00:49:44,664
Hello? Who is this? Hello?

710
00:49:44,766 --> 00:49:46,666
Hello? Hello?

711
00:49:50,005 --> 00:49:51,734
- " Poopies"?
- Oui! " Poopies"!

712
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:54,400
- Oh, puppies.
- Oui. Voila.

713
00:49:54,509 --> 00:49:58,502
You will find them by the river
at the foot of the bridge.

714
00:49:58,613 --> 00:50:02,674
We'll pick them up right away,
monsieur. Bye.

715
00:50:02,784 --> 00:50:06,015
Box of abandoned puppies
just around the corner.

716
00:50:06,121 --> 00:50:08,453
Abandoned no more.

717
00:50:39,721 --> 00:50:41,882
Oh, blimey! The coppers!

718
00:50:43,525 --> 00:50:45,584
Forensics is on its way. Over.

719
00:50:45,694 --> 00:50:48,094
Don't panic, Kevin.
Let me handle this.

720
00:50:49,865 --> 00:50:51,799
- Kevin Shepherd?
- Yes, hello, guv.

721
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:53,800
- I'm Kevin Shepherd.
- Waddles worth!

722
00:50:53,902 --> 00:50:56,302
- Sorry.
- How can I help you, Officer?

723
00:50:57,505 --> 00:50:59,939
A warrant
to search the premises.

724
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,447
You have expensive taste,
sir.

725
00:51:14,556 --> 00:51:17,457
- Don't admit to anything.
- What's all this about?

726
00:51:17,559 --> 00:51:21,518
Sixteen dalmatian puppies
were reported stolen last night.

727
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:24,155
Sir.

728
00:51:24,266 --> 00:51:26,166
You'll never guess.

729
00:51:30,672 --> 00:51:32,196
Oh, no!

730
00:51:32,307 --> 00:51:33,968
Busted!

731
00:51:54,996 --> 00:51:57,226
Oh, Miss De Vil!

732
00:51:57,332 --> 00:52:01,428
Oh, I suppose I must.
Disgusting creature.

733
00:52:08,576 --> 00:52:11,443
Chloe, that helmet!
I'd rather have my skull crushed.

734
00:52:11,546 --> 00:52:14,242
Cruella De Vil,
you're under arrest.

735
00:52:14,349 --> 00:52:16,840
Kevin Sheperd,
you're under arrest.

736
00:52:16,952 --> 00:52:19,011
- Kevin!
- Chloe.

737
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:22,180
Hello, Miss Simon.
Is he one of your charges?

738
00:52:22,290 --> 00:52:24,850
No, he's not the one. She is.

739
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,087
- Why suspect Kevin?
- Caught him red-handed.

740
00:52:27,195 --> 00:52:29,254
And he's got a record
for dog napping.

741
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:34,700
- Well, I can explain...
- You can explain where
you were last night.

742
00:52:34,803 --> 00:52:37,772
He was home kissing her.

743
00:52:37,872 --> 00:52:39,840
- I was out.
- Out?

744
00:52:39,941 --> 00:52:42,466
- Out.
- I think we've established he was out.

745
00:52:42,577 --> 00:52:46,775
- Right. Let's discuss this
at the station.
- He was out with me.

746
00:52:48,850 --> 00:52:51,876
Found this, sir.
List of addresses.

747
00:52:51,987 --> 00:52:54,285
All the houses
that have had dalmatians stolen.

748
00:52:56,391 --> 00:52:58,291
Chloe, you can't possibly believe...

749
00:52:58,393 --> 00:53:02,830
- Oh, this is crazy! I'm being set up!
- Here's the box of puppies
you asked us to...

750
00:53:02,931 --> 00:53:04,865
- Whatever it is, I didn't do it.
- No.

751
00:53:04,966 --> 00:53:07,662
I sent you in
to pick up those.

752
00:53:07,769 --> 00:53:10,670
- Th-There was a phone call, and, uh...
- Oops.

753
00:53:12,574 --> 00:53:16,135
This is crazy!
Why would I steal dalmatians?

754
00:53:16,244 --> 00:53:18,906
Hmm? What possible motive
could I have to want to put...

755
00:53:19,014 --> 00:53:21,244
The judge's order.

756
00:53:21,349 --> 00:53:24,682
- What?
- Oh, Kevin! How could you?

757
00:53:24,786 --> 00:53:27,653
- All this for money?
- What?

758
00:53:27,756 --> 00:53:31,055
Just like you said
at the restaurant.

759
00:53:31,159 --> 00:53:35,095
Will somebody kindly acquaint me
with the facts?

760
00:53:35,196 --> 00:53:39,326
If I'm caught stealing puppies,
my entire fortune goes to him.

761
00:53:40,602 --> 00:53:43,070
Would that be a motive?

762
00:53:47,809 --> 00:53:51,472
I'm innocent, I tell you!
Innocent!

763
00:53:51,579 --> 00:53:53,672
- Couldn't tear them apart, sir.
- No. Never mind.

764
00:53:53,782 --> 00:53:56,216
Just goes to show
a dog will love anyone.

765
00:53:57,485 --> 00:54:01,546
Inspector Armstrong!
Oh, Inspector, thank you.

766
00:54:01,656 --> 00:54:05,786
You and your men do such a wonderful job
protecting the weak and the innocent.

767
00:54:05,894 --> 00:54:08,692
Oh, thank you very much.
And I must say, Miss De Vil...

768
00:54:08,797 --> 00:54:11,061
you are the most remarkable case
of rehabilitation...

769
00:54:11,166 --> 00:54:13,066
I've known
in all my years on the force.

770
00:54:13,168 --> 00:54:15,762
Thank you so much. Bye-bye.

771
00:54:15,870 --> 00:54:17,770
Good-bye.

772
00:54:37,659 --> 00:54:41,527
Don't be hard on yourself, dear.
We were both fooled.

773
00:54:42,931 --> 00:54:47,391
I'm sorry, Miss De Vil.
I had no idea that Kevin was a...

774
00:54:47,502 --> 00:54:49,561
that-that I let myself trust him.

775
00:54:49,671 --> 00:54:53,630
Oh, this is all so dreadful.
You need distraction, darling.

776
00:54:53,741 --> 00:54:57,302
I'm having a few friends 'round
for dinner tonight with their dogs.

777
00:54:57,412 --> 00:54:59,710
Why don't you and yours join us?

778
00:54:59,814 --> 00:55:02,647
Adults only, of course.
Oh, do come!

779
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:06,811
Remember, darling:
We have the doggies to live for.

780
00:55:10,325 --> 00:55:12,225
Smashing!

781
00:55:15,663 --> 00:55:17,756
A party!

782
00:55:17,865 --> 00:55:21,357
I was hoping
we would dine alone tonight.

783
00:55:21,469 --> 00:55:25,838
- I can't be seen dining
with a furrier, you fool!
- You fool!

784
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:27,965
In fact,
you shouldn't even be here at all.

785
00:55:29,110 --> 00:55:31,840
Why do you keep that " job odd" man
about the place?

786
00:55:31,946 --> 00:55:35,973
- Are you jealous, Jean-Pierre?
-Jealous? Of him?

787
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:38,984
- What can he do for you?
- Steal puppies.

788
00:55:39,086 --> 00:55:41,816
- Like taking the baby from the candy.
- Oh, just like.

789
00:55:41,922 --> 00:55:45,983
Well, now's your chance to impress me.
I've saved the last three for you.

790
00:55:46,093 --> 00:55:48,789
- Me?
- Three very special puppies.

791
00:55:48,896 --> 00:55:52,195
- The owner will be out.
- But, cherie...

792
00:55:52,299 --> 00:55:55,132
Faint heart
never won fair lady, Jean-Pierre.

793
00:55:56,337 --> 00:55:59,500
The keys, my little c-c-cabbage.

794
00:56:17,324 --> 00:56:19,224
Dipstick.

795
00:56:28,602 --> 00:56:31,002
Chloe, darling.

796
00:56:31,105 --> 00:56:34,370
Dipstick,
how kind of you to come.

797
00:56:35,776 --> 00:56:38,939
Oh, not still holding a grudge,
are we?

798
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:42,210
Dipstick, be polite.

799
00:56:42,316 --> 00:56:45,251
I'm so pleased you're here,
darling.

800
00:56:45,352 --> 00:56:47,320
Come with me.

801
00:56:49,423 --> 00:56:51,857
Now, tell me.

802
00:56:51,959 --> 00:56:56,919
Your little spotted puppy
is all snug and safe at home?

803
00:56:57,031 --> 00:57:00,194
- Yes. They're with Dottie.
- Oh, with Mummy!

804
00:57:00,301 --> 00:57:03,429
- Yes.
- How dear.

805
00:57:03,537 --> 00:57:07,439
It's such a relief
to have the bad man in jail.

806
00:57:07,541 --> 00:57:11,033
If puppies can't be safe
in this world, who can?

807
00:57:17,451 --> 00:57:21,046
Dinner is served. Alonso?

808
00:57:25,226 --> 00:57:27,751
Take our guests of honor
to their places.

809
00:57:27,862 --> 00:57:30,729
I've a special surprise
planned for you, my dear.

810
00:57:43,811 --> 00:57:47,440
Tonight,
our dogs join us at table...

811
00:57:47,548 --> 00:57:52,747
so we can show our appreciation
to a magnificent species.

812
00:57:52,853 --> 00:57:56,619
My past has been riddled
with mistakes.

813
00:57:56,724 --> 00:57:58,624
I pray someday to be forgiven.

814
00:57:59,727 --> 00:58:05,529
- Shh.
- But tonight, I will begin
to set things right.

815
00:58:05,633 --> 00:58:10,332
From tonight,
we'll be closer than ever.

816
00:58:12,897 --> 00:58:16,355
- To the dogs!
- To the dogs!

817
00:58:28,913 --> 00:58:31,347
" Bone" appetit!

818
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:35,642
Please eat. Eat.

819
00:58:42,927 --> 00:58:45,657
Dipstick, do you want mine?

820
00:58:58,376 --> 00:59:00,776
For heaven's sake...

821
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:11,681
Whee! Whee!

822
00:59:15,527 --> 00:59:18,360
- Oh, my... Whoo.
- No!

823
00:59:18,463 --> 00:59:21,193
Everyone eat!

824
00:59:34,679 --> 00:59:39,548
Where's Dipstick?
Dipstick! Dipstick!

825
01:01:13,777 --> 01:01:16,644
Oh. Oh.

826
01:01:39,636 --> 01:01:43,868
Ah-ha.
Bonsoir, my little ones.

827
01:01:43,974 --> 01:01:47,876
I am the great Le Pelt,
and you are...

828
01:01:47,978 --> 01:01:50,913
how do you say... dog meat.

829
01:01:54,885 --> 01:01:58,013
Oh, no. Ooh. Nice, nice doggy.

830
01:01:58,122 --> 01:02:01,853
Dog nice! Nice!

831
01:02:05,496 --> 01:02:07,794
Oh, quiet!

832
01:02:07,898 --> 01:02:11,595
Shh. Nice. Be quiet.
Yes. Be quiet.

833
01:02:11,702 --> 01:02:14,136
Be nice.

834
01:02:43,133 --> 01:02:46,330
"Three puppies," she said. Hmm?

835
01:04:30,106 --> 01:04:31,368
Surprise!

836
01:04:33,510 --> 01:04:35,774
Earlier than I'd planned,
but c'est la vie.

837
01:04:35,879 --> 01:04:39,645
- I hereby revoke your probation.
- And I hereby lock you up.

838
01:04:39,749 --> 01:04:41,876
With St. Kevin of Assisi
in the clink...

839
01:04:41,985 --> 01:04:45,921
it just wouldn't do if three
more puppies were reported missing.

840
01:04:46,022 --> 01:04:48,923
- Three more?
- Good-bye, my dear.

841
01:04:49,025 --> 01:04:53,962
- No!
- I'll think of you every time
I wear your sweet little doggies.

842
01:04:54,063 --> 01:04:56,554
No!

843
01:04:56,666 --> 01:04:58,691
Stop!

844
01:05:12,615 --> 01:05:14,742
Ooh, not bad.

845
01:05:14,851 --> 01:05:17,411
The English
can do the knitwear, huh?

846
01:05:37,273 --> 01:05:39,264
Shh. Be quiet.

847
01:05:55,792 --> 01:06:00,092
Ooh. Ooh. Hey.
What's that? Listen. Hey.

848
01:06:00,196 --> 01:06:03,222
- Listen up. You hear that?
- What? What is it?

849
01:06:03,333 --> 01:06:07,030
Uh, best I can make out,
th-they're all yapping about "tubble."

850
01:06:07,136 --> 01:06:09,468
"Tubble"? Oh, "trouble"!

851
01:06:09,572 --> 01:06:12,268
- Must be puppies talking.
- Listen. Hey, wait. There's more.

852
01:06:12,375 --> 01:06:16,971
Uh, "widdle ones"?
" Bad man gwab widdle ones.

853
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:19,048
Twee potted doggies."

854
01:06:19,148 --> 01:06:23,346
" Potted"?
"Twee widdle potted..."

855
01:06:23,453 --> 01:06:27,822
" Bad man grabs
three little spotted doggies."

856
01:06:29,993 --> 01:06:32,359
Oh, my gosh. Chloe's dogs.

857
01:07:28,884 --> 01:07:33,048
The puppies!
Thank you, Fluffy!

858
01:07:34,489 --> 01:07:37,049
Go to sleep

859
01:07:37,158 --> 01:07:40,184
Go to sleep

860
01:07:40,295 --> 01:07:45,562
Go to sleep, little guardie

861
01:07:53,508 --> 01:07:56,568
Dog, James Dog.

862
01:08:02,550 --> 01:08:04,916
Go back to sleep

863
01:08:05,020 --> 01:08:09,150
Go back to sleep, stupid guardie

864
01:08:22,337 --> 01:08:23,998
Taxi!

865
01:08:27,275 --> 01:08:30,904
- St. John's Mews, please.
- You know I could do five to ten
for this?

866
01:08:31,012 --> 01:08:34,448
That's 35 to 70 in dog years. Ow!

867
01:09:03,945 --> 01:09:05,469
They've gone.

868
01:09:17,258 --> 01:09:19,658
- Where are they?
- Calm down. Calm down.

869
01:09:23,598 --> 01:09:25,725
Oh!

870
01:09:38,312 --> 01:09:41,008
I'm so sorry.
l-l-I should've trusted you.

871
01:09:41,115 --> 01:09:44,573
No. I should never have trusted Cruella.
And with my police record, how could...

872
01:09:44,685 --> 01:09:47,119
- It doesn't matter.
- Yes, it does matter.

873
01:09:50,024 --> 01:09:51,992
Look...

874
01:09:52,093 --> 01:09:54,857
I broke into the lab
and freed those dogs.

875
01:09:56,264 --> 01:09:58,391
They were being used
for experiments.

876
01:10:00,401 --> 01:10:03,962
That was
your dog napping conviction?

877
01:10:04,071 --> 01:10:06,232
Yes.

878
01:10:06,340 --> 01:10:08,274
- That's all?
- Yes.

879
01:10:40,808 --> 01:10:43,072
What's this?

880
01:10:43,177 --> 01:10:45,077
"The Orient Express. "

881
01:10:47,982 --> 01:10:49,882
Paris.

882
01:10:51,786 --> 01:10:54,220
They're going to Paris!
Come on!

883
01:10:56,623 --> 01:10:58,557
Oh, Jean-Pierre,
you've outdone yourself.

884
01:10:58,658 --> 01:11:01,593
I am the Napoleon of the fur,
and you are my...

885
01:11:01,695 --> 01:11:05,290
- Waterloo?
- My Josephine. Together, we...

886
01:11:05,398 --> 01:11:07,423
The rat!

887
01:11:07,534 --> 01:11:10,298
I need spotted puppies,
you idiot!

888
01:11:10,403 --> 01:11:14,100
But it is not a rat.
I know rats. It's a "poopie."

889
01:11:14,207 --> 01:11:16,675
- Alonso!
- Yes?

890
01:11:16,777 --> 01:11:19,575
Find the rat. Kill it. Le Pelt and I
will be on the Orient Express.

891
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:24,582
- K-K-Kill?
- The last time I underestimated
a puppy, I wound up in the pokey.

892
01:11:24,684 --> 01:11:26,845
- Go!
- Why not him?

893
01:11:27,754 --> 01:11:30,154
Yes, yes. Thank you.

894
01:12:23,276 --> 01:12:25,210
Excuse me. The Orient Express?

895
01:12:25,312 --> 01:12:27,212
Platform nine.

896
01:12:29,449 --> 01:12:32,748
Paris! City of I'amour!
Of la mode! Of Le Pelt!

897
01:12:57,777 --> 01:13:01,304
Le Pelt, with his slippery,
Frenchman ways.

898
01:13:01,414 --> 01:13:04,872
She'll see.
She'll see that I'm the loyal one.

899
01:13:06,286 --> 01:13:09,847
- Alonso.
- Oh, joy. Le petit homme.

900
01:13:09,956 --> 01:13:12,186
You took care of the rat?

901
01:13:14,494 --> 01:13:19,625
You will never see it again.

902
01:13:26,940 --> 01:13:30,603
- This isn't the Orient Express.
- We're on the wrong platform!

903
01:13:30,710 --> 01:13:32,610
There she is!

904
01:13:34,047 --> 01:13:35,947
Come on.

905
01:13:38,585 --> 01:13:40,519
Oddball!

906
01:13:44,124 --> 01:13:46,592
Oh, no! I can't look!
She'll be killed!

907
01:13:52,232 --> 01:13:57,795
Somebody do something! Oh, what
am I doing? Help! Ah! Help! Ha!

908
01:13:57,904 --> 01:14:01,601
- Your wings! Flap your wings!
- Flap wings?

909
01:14:01,708 --> 01:14:06,941
Oh, where did these come from?
Blimey, they work! I can fly!

910
01:14:07,047 --> 01:14:10,414
Dogs can fly!

911
01:14:18,858 --> 01:14:23,921
Whee-yah! I just realized
I'm not a rottweiler at all.

912
01:14:24,030 --> 01:14:25,827
I'm a retriever.

913
01:14:41,381 --> 01:14:42,746
- Where are we going?
- Paris.

914
01:14:42,849 --> 01:14:45,283
- We've missed the train!
- Then we'll catch the next one!

915
01:14:47,787 --> 01:14:51,723
Do you think he saw us?
W-W-We'd better hide. But where?

916
01:14:54,894 --> 01:14:58,125
What? " Bad wady's cow"?

917
01:14:58,231 --> 01:15:00,631
Oh! Good idea, spotty.

918
01:15:20,453 --> 01:15:22,353
Paris!

919
01:15:23,990 --> 01:15:26,049
Careful.

920
01:15:26,158 --> 01:15:29,025
Mustn't harm the "poopies."

921
01:15:38,971 --> 01:15:44,807
The p... The p-poopie man
gets to ride in the c-car.

922
01:15:44,911 --> 01:15:48,938
- Is Alonso keeping up?
- The little man is too slow.

923
01:15:49,048 --> 01:15:52,211
This traffic is too slow.
The French are useless behind the wheel.

924
01:15:58,724 --> 01:16:02,717
- You're going the wrong way!
- They're going the wrong way!

925
01:16:02,828 --> 01:16:05,888
We're going to die! Whoo!

926
01:16:13,639 --> 01:16:16,472
Shut up, Jean-Pierre!

927
01:16:18,778 --> 01:16:21,372
Jean-Pierre, our next challenge:

928
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:24,210
reinventing the poodle skirt.

929
01:16:44,536 --> 01:16:46,470
- Nothing. Nobody saw anything.
- Oh.

930
01:16:56,815 --> 01:16:59,648
I didn't know you spoke French.

931
01:17:02,554 --> 01:17:06,650
Come on! Come on!
Taxi! Stop!

932
01:17:19,838 --> 01:17:21,999
So, what did they say?

933
01:17:23,408 --> 01:17:25,308
Follow les chiens!

934
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:39,217
It's spooky, all right, but you'd
have to be a sniveling, whimpering...

935
01:17:39,324 --> 01:17:42,020
cowardly little chihuahua
not to barge right in there...

936
01:17:42,126 --> 01:17:45,687
and take charge of the situation
with no hesitation at all.

937
01:17:47,565 --> 01:17:49,465
After you, then.

938
01:18:00,712 --> 01:18:02,805
Oh, I'm gonna regret this.

939
01:18:15,493 --> 01:18:19,395
What do you look at?
Work! Work!

940
01:18:24,035 --> 01:18:26,435
- Illegal immigrants?
- Of course.

941
01:18:26,537 --> 01:18:28,334
Hmm.

942
01:18:28,439 --> 01:18:30,498
How much?

943
01:18:30,608 --> 01:18:34,408
- Fifty francs a week.
- Ooh. That's not much.

944
01:18:35,513 --> 01:18:37,947
It's all they can afford.

945
01:18:38,149 --> 01:18:40,344
I sure hope you know
where you're going, pup.

946
01:18:41,819 --> 01:18:43,719
Bingo.

947
01:18:45,656 --> 01:18:49,183
Right. Don't worry, Oddball.
I'll have 'em out in a jiffy.

948
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:57,995
Hmm. Tastes like chicken.

949
01:19:08,946 --> 01:19:10,846
Ooh.

950
01:19:12,850 --> 01:19:15,080
It's no good
looking at me like that.

951
01:19:16,454 --> 01:19:18,354
It won't do any good, you know.

952
01:19:20,391 --> 01:19:23,053
Sorry.

953
01:19:38,776 --> 01:19:40,107
Okay.

954
01:19:55,793 --> 01:19:58,523
We'll wait.

955
01:19:59,864 --> 01:20:02,924
- Did you hear something?
- It's just your little man outside.

956
01:20:09,607 --> 01:20:12,132
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

957
01:20:14,412 --> 01:20:17,711
Hey, I thought I told you
to wait outside? Hey.

958
01:20:17,815 --> 01:20:20,215
I know, but they were worried.

959
01:20:20,317 --> 01:20:23,684
- Oh.
- You okay?

960
01:20:23,788 --> 01:20:26,382
Hello!

961
01:20:26,490 --> 01:20:29,015
- Hi!
- You all right?

962
01:20:29,126 --> 01:20:32,789
Okay. Let's get them out of here.
Come on.

963
01:20:33,731 --> 01:20:35,995
Well, Miss Houdini.

964
01:20:37,134 --> 01:20:39,295
Aren't you in a tight spot?

965
01:20:40,938 --> 01:20:44,931
Ooh, what fun,
to get away with murder. Ta-ta!

966
01:20:48,913 --> 01:20:51,882
I'm really beginning
to dislike that woman.

967
01:20:58,948 --> 01:21:01,314
There's got to be a way
out of here.

968
01:21:12,162 --> 01:21:15,222
- Hello, nice bird.
- Shh.

969
01:21:15,331 --> 01:21:17,765
- Waddles worth! Is Oddball with you?
- Shh.

970
01:21:17,867 --> 01:21:20,700
You bet she's here.
She's commando leader.

971
01:21:20,804 --> 01:21:23,602
- Now, pass up the pups, quick.
- Okay.

972
01:21:24,507 --> 01:21:26,737
One. Have a seat.

973
01:21:28,745 --> 01:21:32,545
Two. Good, good.
Join the other one.

974
01:21:32,649 --> 01:21:35,709
- Come on. Hurry up! Hurry up!
- Yes.

975
01:21:55,572 --> 01:21:58,200
One hundred.
In a bunch. Come on. In a bunch.

976
01:21:59,309 --> 01:22:03,211
One hundred and... Are you one hundred
or one hundred and one? Oh, great.

977
01:22:03,313 --> 01:22:05,975
- Now we have to start all over again.
- That's it.

978
01:22:13,590 --> 01:22:17,253
Bring me the puppies!
Come on!

979
01:22:26,502 --> 01:22:31,405
- This is my favorite part.
- The skinning? Not the strangling?

980
01:22:31,507 --> 01:22:33,475
Ah, I like the strangling also.

981
01:22:33,576 --> 01:22:37,376
The mark of a great furrier, Alonso,
is that he does his own strangling.

982
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:39,778
- Remember that.
- Thank you.

983
01:22:40,142 --> 01:22:41,871
Shh.

984
01:22:50,185 --> 01:22:53,154
It's the little rat!

985
01:22:53,255 --> 01:22:56,315
- You lied to me.
- M-M-Me? Why should l...

986
01:22:58,360 --> 01:23:01,989
Does she look dead to you?
Does she?

987
01:23:02,097 --> 01:23:04,759
You worm!
I'll kill her myself.

988
01:23:07,469 --> 01:23:09,562
You are a wormy little man.

989
01:23:16,612 --> 01:23:18,705
Oh!

990
01:23:35,998 --> 01:23:37,590
Whoa!

991
01:23:39,335 --> 01:23:42,202
You're both idiots!

992
01:23:59,955 --> 01:24:01,820
Excuse me!

993
01:24:08,964 --> 01:24:10,454
Work!

994
01:24:22,111 --> 01:24:25,103
Now I crush you, little man.

995
01:24:33,088 --> 01:24:35,613
Who's the little man now?

996
01:24:59,047 --> 01:25:02,346
I'll wear you on my sleeve.

997
01:25:38,420 --> 01:25:41,719
Here, puppy, puppy, puppy.

998
01:25:42,691 --> 01:25:46,183
Sweet puppy.

999
01:28:27,788 --> 01:28:30,154
- Quickly. To the bakery.
- But can we trust him?

1000
01:28:30,258 --> 01:28:33,853
Now is not the time to
count your change, Kevin. Come on.

1001
01:28:33,961 --> 01:28:35,690
She's after the puppies!

1002
01:29:04,692 --> 01:29:07,661
I've got you now, you little rat!

1003
01:29:25,413 --> 01:29:27,347
Ohh.

1004
01:29:34,188 --> 01:29:37,385
Without spots,
you're just not worth the trouble.

1005
01:29:37,491 --> 01:29:39,391
Chop, chop!

1006
01:29:45,132 --> 01:29:47,100
And now to my coat!

1007
01:30:17,531 --> 01:30:20,432
Domino! Little Dipper!

1008
01:30:20,534 --> 01:30:23,731
- Oddball!
- Oddball?

1009
01:30:23,837 --> 01:30:27,136
Where are you?
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

1010
01:31:50,490 --> 01:31:55,291
And now for the topper:
You may now kick the bride.

1011
01:32:23,290 --> 01:32:27,727
I'm ruined!
This is the fall of Maison Le Pelt.

1012
01:32:27,828 --> 01:32:30,194
How do we get out from this mess?

1013
01:32:30,297 --> 01:32:32,765
- Piece of cake.
- That is the lady.

1014
01:32:53,719 --> 01:32:57,018
Look out, everybody!
It's the bad lady's cow.

1015
01:32:57,122 --> 01:32:58,987
Oh, no.

1016
01:33:10,569 --> 01:33:14,198
Hello, all. I've come
from Miss De Vil's solicitor...

1017
01:33:14,306 --> 01:33:16,206
Mr. Torte.

1018
01:33:16,308 --> 01:33:19,766
I asked if I might have the pleasure
of delivering this.

1019
01:33:34,827 --> 01:33:37,887
- Eight million pounds?
- Yes!

1020
01:33:37,997 --> 01:33:39,794
- It's the judge's orders.
- Eight million... Eight million quid?

1021
01:33:39,899 --> 01:33:41,799
- Eight million pounds!
- Eight million quid.

1022
01:33:41,901 --> 01:33:43,630
- It's for the dogs, of course.
- That's eight million.
- Of course.

1023
01:33:43,736 --> 01:33:47,433
- That's eight million!
- And for the best, unless...
unless she's rehabilitated.

1024
01:33:47,539 --> 01:33:51,498
No, Alonso.
Cruella will always be Cruella.

1025
01:33:51,610 --> 01:33:54,078
Well, hope springs eternal.

1026
01:34:00,979 --> 01:34:04,745
What's that puppy doing up there?

1027
01:34:04,850 --> 01:34:07,080
- No! Oddball!
- Oddball!

1028
01:34:11,390 --> 01:34:15,622
- Oh, Oddball!
- What have you been up to now? Oh.

1029
01:34:15,727 --> 01:34:17,752
- What have you been doing?
- Come here. Come here.

1030
01:34:17,863 --> 01:34:20,263
Hey. Hey.

1031
01:34:20,365 --> 01:34:23,266
Ohh. Look.

1032
01:34:24,470 --> 01:34:27,371
Kevin, look.

1033
01:34:27,473 --> 01:34:31,102
These won't come off.
She's got her spots.

1034
01:34:32,244 --> 01:34:35,213
Oddball's got her spots! Look!

1035
01:34:45,424 --> 01:34:48,450
S-P-O-T-S!

1036
01:34:50,455 --> 01:34:52,150
Digga-digga-dog
Digga-digga-dog

1037
01:34:52,256 --> 01:34:54,224
- Digga-digga-dog, Digga-digga-dog
- Bow-wow-wow

1038
01:34:54,325 --> 01:34:58,227
- Digga-digga-dog
Digga-digga-dog, dog, dog
- You dog, you!

1039
01:34:58,329 --> 01:35:00,092
Bow-wow-wow
yippee-yo, yippee-yay

1040
01:35:00,198 --> 01:35:04,635
Can you keep that excitation
down to a roar

1041
01:35:04,736 --> 01:35:08,035
Atomic dog

1042
01:35:08,139 --> 01:35:10,630
When fate comes a-knockin'

1043
01:35:10,742 --> 01:35:12,710
Better open the door

1044
01:35:12,810 --> 01:35:16,041
Atomic dog

1045
01:35:16,147 --> 01:35:18,638
Rise to the occasion

1046
01:35:18,750 --> 01:35:21,514
Yeah, answer the call

1047
01:35:21,619 --> 01:35:23,712
Hey

1048
01:35:23,821 --> 01:35:26,187
If they're pitchin'
second chances

1049
01:35:26,290 --> 01:35:28,986
Don't you fumble the ball

1050
01:35:29,093 --> 01:35:32,221
- No, no, no
- You dog, you!

1051
01:35:32,330 --> 01:35:36,130
- Digga-digga-dog, Digga-digga-dog
- Don't be believin'

1052
01:35:36,234 --> 01:35:40,193
- Looks are deceivin'
- You dog, you!

1053
01:35:40,304 --> 01:35:44,172
- Don't be believin'
- Digga-digga-dog

1054
01:35:44,275 --> 01:35:48,143
- Looks are deceivin'
- You dog, you!

1055
01:35:48,246 --> 01:35:50,111
Bow-wow-wow
Yippee-yo, yippee-yay

1056
01:35:50,214 --> 01:35:54,742
Sometimes you gotta dream
with eyes wide open

1057
01:35:54,852 --> 01:35:58,618
- Atomic dog
- Yeah, you do

1058
01:35:58,723 --> 01:36:02,659
You can't earn your spots
just wishin' and hopin'

1059
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:05,524
- Atomic dog
- No, you can't

1060
01:36:05,630 --> 01:36:08,599
Goin' out on a limb
for a cause

1061
01:36:08,700 --> 01:36:12,101
The heart must be brave

1062
01:36:12,203 --> 01:36:13,693
Yeah

1063
01:36:13,805 --> 01:36:16,706
And a miracle's a gift

1064
01:36:16,808 --> 01:36:18,969
Of keeping the faith

1065
01:36:19,077 --> 01:36:22,205
- Gotta keep the faith
- You dog, you!

1066
01:36:22,313 --> 01:36:26,181
- Don't be believin'
- Digga-digga-bow-wow-wow

1067
01:36:26,284 --> 01:36:30,152
- Looks are deceivin'
- You dog, you!

1068
01:36:30,254 --> 01:36:34,156
- Don't be believin'
- Digga-digga-bow-wow-wow

1069
01:36:34,258 --> 01:36:38,661
- Looks are deceivin'
- You dog, you!

1070
01:36:39,597 --> 01:36:41,394
Bow-wow-wow

1071
01:36:41,499 --> 01:36:43,467
Bow, bow

1072
01:36:43,568 --> 01:36:45,399
Bow, bow

1073
01:36:45,503 --> 01:36:48,097
Bow-wow-wow
Bow-wow-wow

1074
01:36:48,206 --> 01:36:52,472
Spotted dog, spotted dog
Where have you been

1075
01:36:52,577 --> 01:36:55,978
I've been to London
to look at the queen

1076
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:58,139
Can you tell a spotted story

1077
01:36:58,249 --> 01:37:00,183
Yes, I can

1078
01:37:00,284 --> 01:37:03,811
I saw a dog
who was walkin' a man

1079
01:37:03,921 --> 01:37:06,583
Oww, you dog, you!

1080
01:37:06,691 --> 01:37:08,591
What you gonna do

1081
01:37:10,561 --> 01:37:13,052
What you gonna do

1082
01:37:13,164 --> 01:37:15,860
And I think I deserve
a second chance too.

1083
01:37:17,135 --> 01:37:19,865
- Don't you?
- What you gonna do

1084
01:37:23,207 --> 01:37:27,075
You let me think
that I knew you

1085
01:37:27,178 --> 01:37:30,045
You let me think
I was right

1086
01:37:31,215 --> 01:37:34,651
I only saw
what you wanted me to

1087
01:37:34,752 --> 01:37:39,155
You caught me
in your web of lies

1088
01:37:39,257 --> 01:37:42,693
Now you tell me
that it's gonna be different

1089
01:37:42,794 --> 01:37:45,820
And just how much
you've changed

1090
01:37:45,930 --> 01:37:49,866
What you gonna do
with your second chance

1091
01:37:49,967 --> 01:37:53,801
What I wouldn't give
to read your mind

1092
01:37:53,905 --> 01:37:58,342
What you gonna do
with your second chance

1093
01:37:58,442 --> 01:38:00,603
Will you throw it away

1094
01:38:00,711 --> 01:38:02,872
Or get it right this time

1095
01:38:02,980 --> 01:38:05,141
I'm warnin' you
I'm watchin' you

1096
01:38:05,249 --> 01:38:09,151
What you gonna do, What you gonna do
I'm warnin' you, I'm watchin you

1097
01:38:09,253 --> 01:38:11,346
What you gonna do

1098
01:38:11,455 --> 01:38:14,288
- It's so easy to say it
- Say it

1099
01:38:14,392 --> 01:38:19,125
For a while
you can put on a show
