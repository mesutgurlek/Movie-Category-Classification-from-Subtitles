1
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,300
CINEART

2
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,220
Dedicated to our fathers and their children

3
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,900
Once upon a time there was a land

4
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,860
which had as capital Belgrado.

5
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,380
April, 6th 1941

6
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:06,060
I'll kill them all, mate!

7
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,060
Watch out!

8
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,740
I'll kill them all!

9
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,500
It's to dangerous.

10
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,780
Ivan!

11
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,620
Brother!

12
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,780
The vice-president talked

13
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,500
about tightening the relations

14
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:59,260
between the states of Yugoslavia...

15
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:11,100
That's my brother...

16
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,740
and his best friend, Blacky.

17
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,420
Idiots!

18
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,780
Idiots!

19
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:20,060
What can I do?

20
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,100
I don't have anyone else on the world.

21
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,060
Marko!

22
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:39,780
Come over and have a cup of coffee.

23
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,060
I can't, I'm in a hurry!

24
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,020
My friend is tired!

25
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,500
I'm tired!

26
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,420
Tomorrow I'll take you out for lunch

27
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,980
in the Russian Czar!

28
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,420
Go back inside!

29
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,740
Vera,

30
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,500
I'm a free man.

31
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,340
A free man? Come on.

32
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,540
Damn!

33
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,380
Vera, I need to

34
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,900
tell you something important.

35
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,540
What?
-Don't get mad.

36
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,220
We wrote Petar

37
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,860
in the Communist Party.

38
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,460
You mean in the brothel.

39
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,300
He is now one of us.

40
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,060
Inside! -I come.

41
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,260
A last word to my friend.

42
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:44,100
I got business to take care of.

43
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,300
You see what I have to go through.

44
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,020
Come over here, so I'll kiss you.

45
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,620
Not on the mouth, idiot!

46
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,340
Blacky, inside!

47
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,340
It's the same thing each morning.

48
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,180
I'm going to leave you,

49
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,140
just like Marko's wife.

50
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,180
I'm a free man!

51
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,220
Ini Mini Moo...

52
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,100
First part - The War

53
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,060
A garret

54
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,340
Under the roof

55
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,780
On the wall...

56
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,540
Looloo... breakfast!

57
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,460
On the wall does a clock

58
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:11,580
Ticktack

59
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,940
A garret

60
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,660
Under the roof

61
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,300
Does she obey you,

62
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,540
your mother?

63
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,140
Soni!

64
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,420
Yes, that's the way...

65
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,420
Continue...

66
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,500
It comes...
-Let me go!

67
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,100
Go? You have to come here.

68
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,300
Come back!

69
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:45,420
Bloody fascist swines.

70
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,420
How can you continue your meal?

71
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,300
I can, don't you see?

72
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,100
How can you, with all these bombs?

73
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,180
Just because.

74
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,260
Do I have to die on an empty stomach?

75
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,500
My shoes!

76
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,580
Don't touch my shoes!

77
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,460
Stupid bastard!

78
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,380
This is the end.

79
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,980
Enough!

80
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,580
My city!

81
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,180
They are bombing my city!

82
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,620
My city!

83
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,900
What are you going to do, Blacky?

84
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,300
I'm going to welcome these criminals

85
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,820
who are distroying my city.

86
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,300
I know where you are going.
-Oh, you do?

87
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,060
I know.

88
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,780
To your whore.

89
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,340
What whore?

90
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,060
You are hallucinating.

91
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,780
Your actrice.
-What actrice?

92
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,500
I'm going to defend my country.

93
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,940
Don't lie!

94
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,100
You are going to defend your whore!

95
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:32,100
Impossible to talk with you.

96
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,700
What do you say now?

97
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,580
You are driving me to a nervous breakdown.

98
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:45,540
I say what everyone says.

99
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,700
Blacky!

100
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,220
Yes, my love? What is it?

101
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,300
You are always at the theatre!

102
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,900
Every night you are at the theatre!

103
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,180
Because I love the theatre.

104
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,140
You love the theatre?

105
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,980
You love the theatre?!

106
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,300
Is it that strange?

107
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:06,460
You love your whore, not the theatre!

108
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,100
If you were not pregnant...

109
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,820
What then? You dirty liar!

110
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,820
Me?
-Yes You!

111
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,820
Son of a bitch! Liar!

112
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,660
What? What is it?

113
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,260
You should be ashamed of yourself, Vera.

114
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,260
Blacky!

115
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,820
What happens?

116
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,340
Don't cry.

117
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,940
I'll build a new zoo for you.

118
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,380
Look.

119
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,700
You, go away!

120
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,700
The animals will eat the survivors.

121
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,460
Here some money for you.

122
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:06,300
Buy some milk for that little monkey.

123
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,860
Stop crying.

124
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,620
The germans will laugh with you.

125
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,220
NATIONAL THEATRE

126
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,420
CLEARING WORKS

127
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,340
At work, artists?

128
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,580
You could say so!

129
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,060
Bato, candy.

130
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,740
Uncle Blacky!

131
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,420
Are you afraid of me? Playing is over.

132
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,860
You can be sure about that.

133
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,260
What do you mean?

134
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,420
You know it very good.

135
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,380
No, really I don't.

136
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,260
Do you want me and Bato

137
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,420
in the working camp?
-What?

138
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,220
The whole city is talking about it.

139
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,060
You are a thief!
- Me?

140
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,660
What are they saying?

141
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,460
Don't act like you know nothing about it.

142
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,500
You are stealing their gold, their money.

143
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:13,740
Thief!

144
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,860
I steal from the rich...

145
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,060
what they stole from the poor.

146
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,700
Stop it.
- Stop it also.

147
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:20,980
At work?

148
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,980
Do you love me?

149
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,420
Yes.

150
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,860
Give me a kiss.

151
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,060
She loves me.

152
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,580
I've been looking for you for days.

153
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,900
I'm scared.

154
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,460
You are getting on my nerves.

155
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:44,140
You on mine! Did you see this?

156
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,620
They are looking for you.

157
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,540
Ten thousand!

158
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,020
Is that all? Ridiculous.

159
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,620
Franz!

160
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,260
Franz?

161
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,460
Fräulein Zovko...

162
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,300
Franz, good morning.

163
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,220
I have been waiting for you.

164
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,100
Our table is waiting

165
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,860
in the Russian Czar.

166
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,100
Yes, and my brother?

167
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,180
Seisenberger, do me a favor...

168
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,380
Take that vehicle and follow us.

169
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,820
But careful!

170
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,140
Franz...

171
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:40,340
Ivan, open up!

172
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,820
Stay at the door

173
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,020
and don't move.

174
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,780
Damn, what a smell.

175
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,980
Vera, sit down.

176
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,220
My brother is just like Noach.

177
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,500
He saves the world after the flood.

178
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,780
Don't move and be quiet.

179
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,740
What are you doing?

180
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,620
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

181
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,940
When will you stop trying to hang yourself?

182
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,140
God.

183
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,260
I've had enough

184
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,900
of this life.

185
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,660
Enough? Instead of helping me

186
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,620
and become a hero

187
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,420
you hang yourself like a girlie.

188
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,940
Shame on you.

189
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,700
Message from the Gestapo

190
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,780
to all citizens of Belgrado

191
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,380
and surroundings.

192
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:06,180
A train with weapons and munition

193
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,820
has been attacked tonight.

194
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,820
This is the work

195
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,860
of communist bandits.

196
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,460
Petar "Blacky" Popara,

197
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,740
and Marko Dren.

198
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,180
What did you do?

199
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,700
Nothing, we just

200
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,660
hit these thieves a bit.

201
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,100
Marko, good Lord!

202
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,900
What will become of me?

203
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,700
Someone has betrayed us.

204
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,740
A dirty traitor.

205
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,420
Our comrades have been busted.

206
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:40,580
Do they have Blacky? Busted?

207
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,140
With his balls, yes.

208
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,620
Just like me by the way.

209
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,220
Come on, hurry up!

210
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,740
Why do I have to go?

211
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,140
Because you are my brother.

212
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,260
Leave him!

213
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,780
Come on, children!

214
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:29,220
No problem. I'm okay.

215
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,380
Who is there?
- It's me, grandpa.

216
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,900
Who is out there?

217
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,540
It's me, Marko.

218
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,380
Who?

219
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,260
Marko, goddammit!

220
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,660
Who?

221
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,460
It's me, Marko! Open up!

222
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,660
Is that you, Marko?
-Yes!

223
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,620
Quick!

224
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,420
The germans can be here any minute.

225
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,260
Go to the cellar,

226
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,220
I'll take care of your stuff.

227
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,420
The cellar is behind the stove.

228
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:15,180
Let them pass!

229
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,140
What are you doing with these animals?

230
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,860
My cellar is a hideout

231
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,300
for people, not a zoo.

232
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,740
I'll close it off.

233
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,500
Terrible.

234
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,980
Terrible...

235
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,260
Where are you, Blacky?

236
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,780
Son of a bitch.

237
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:43,140
Yes, it started!

238
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,660
Grandpa!

239
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,700
Marko!

240
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:58,380
Blacky's wife is about to give birth!

241
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,340
Move!

242
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,620
Fast, please!

243
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,900
Get me some water, a blanket,

244
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:09,420
and a cloth...

245
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,540
Hurry up, he's coming!

246
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,380
Don't be afraid.

247
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:19,540
Are you okay?

248
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,300
Yes, but I don't see a thing.

249
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,460
There he is!

250
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,620
Lift the bicycle!

251
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,860
Higher!

252
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,060
Ivan!

253
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,260
I'm not feeling well.

254
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:22,380
Everything will be allright.

255
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,660
No, I'm feeling terrible.

256
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:33,580
If something happens with me,

257
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,980
call him Jovan.

258
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,940
Vera!

259
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,740
Three years later

260
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:58,500
Belgrado was in

261
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,700
a terrible mental state.

262
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,420
Easy, easy

263
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:17,260
Wild water of the Ibar

264
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:27,020
Why are you in such a hurry?

265
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,180
All together!

266
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,060
I'm also

267
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:45,220
in a lot of grief

268
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:53,020
More

269
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,740
Then you can imagine...

270
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,980
It's on me!

271
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,180
For the birthday of my son.

272
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,380
Here is my Jovan. Look!

273
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:10,340
A handsome boy, Blacky. Congratulations.

274
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,700
He will be, Mustafa.

275
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,100
He will study in Moscow

276
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,820
and become an officer,

277
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:19,380
and not a thief like you, cheat!

278
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,540
We work together,

279
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,460
but how much longer will it last?

280
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,500
Well?

281
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:31,180
Are the thieves getting nervous?

282
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,660
Mate!

283
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,140
Happy birthday for Jovan,

284
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,940
best friend!

285
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,980
My good old pal!

286
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,420
Look!

287
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,020
Completely my replica.

288
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,020
He has something from Vera too.

289
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,780
Do you think so?
Where were you?

290
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,500
There is a traitor.

291
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:50,740
We have got problems.

292
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,180
The three are downstairs.

293
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,140
I've seen it. Don't run away.

294
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,300
Excuse me for waiting.

295
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,740
Good evening.

296
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,660
Please, gentlemen.

297
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,580
I'm doing this for your own good.

298
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,220
Gentlemen, please...

299
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,740
Franz!

300
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:34,540
Flowers for Natalija!

301
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,100
He fucks her and kills us.

302
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,220
Excuse me.

303
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:44,740
Get me a huge bouquet.

304
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,140
Allright.

305
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,980
And the priest?
-I'll fix it.

306
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,340
Great.

307
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,060
Boy...

308
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,140
there is gonna be a wedding!

309
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,860
Put your cards on the table!

310
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:01,500
My gun.
Put yours next to mine.

311
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,380
This is fair play!

312
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,540
Here is your gold. You see?

313
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,460
That's the gold, right?

314
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,900
How much do you make with it?

315
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,860
Look!

316
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,020
How much did you get for it?

317
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,860
How much did you get for the gold?

318
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,780
200.000. - 200.000?

319
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:25,180
Mustafa, you were talking about 120.000.

320
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,380
Tell me where you put the weapons

321
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,140
and we are even.

322
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,980
On my mother's grave,

323
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,940
the germans toke all.

324
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,540
You don't have to swear

325
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,340
on your mother.

326
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,180
Bastard!

327
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,420
Are you stealing my money?

328
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,220
I rob banks

329
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,980
and juwellers,

330
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:53,020
and you steal from me, mother fuckers!

331
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,740
Filthy thieves!

332
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,140
I kill you all, dirtbags!

333
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,620
I shall liberate Belgrado

334
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,660
from scum like you!

335
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:09,260
Our comrades die and

336
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:12,260
starve to death, and you steal!

337
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,820
Are you out of your mind?

338
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,420
No, boys...

339
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,140
you are not playing it well.

340
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,140
Hold this for a moment.

341
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,100
Faster and harder!

342
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:40,620
Here I come, buddy!

343
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,740
Invincible!

344
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,940
Attention!

345
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,300
Here I come!

346
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,980
Not in the ear!

347
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:33,180
Left, left, left!

348
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,220
I have to tell you something,

349
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,340
you as party secretary...

350
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,140
If something hurts us,

351
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,780
it's that scum of

352
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,740
thieves and tramps.

353
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,700
We commit robberies for weapons

354
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,900
and food for our comrades,

355
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:59,140
and these bastards steal from us!

356
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:02,740
I want to commit suicide.

357
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:05,540
You say you are gonna commit suicide,

358
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:08,140
but you won't do it.

359
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,500
Are you sure?

360
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,980
Do you think a man can live...

361
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,620
Quiet!

362
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,900
...without anything or anyone

363
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,700
to live for?

364
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:22,020
You are capitulating?

365
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,900
No, I'm doing a peace

366
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:28,140
proposal!

367
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,820
He devours her.

368
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,020
I'll kill him.

369
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,580
You don't even see the actors.

370
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:39,300
I really like the captain.

371
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,700
Oh yeah?
-Yes, look.

372
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,740
Quiet, this is a theatre.

373
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,140
I'm leaving, mate.

374
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,900
Left!

375
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,260
Keep your hands off!

376
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,020
Watch the stage!

377
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,460
Goodnight!

378
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,900
Tell me honestly

379
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:19,020
the truth

380
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:22,460
and I'll forgive you.

381
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,300
Is Berta my child?

382
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,940
I can't be guilty from

383
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,380
something I didn't do.

384
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,620
Leave me!

385
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,500
Shame on you!

386
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:51,740
...and make his dishonesties public?

387
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,420
Is Berta my child?

388
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,620
Is Berta my child?

389
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,460
Is Berta my child?

390
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,180
I'm coming!

391
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,220
Bato!
-Quiet!

392
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,420
Uncle Blacky!

393
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:08,060
Natalija is the best.

394
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,940
Franz!

395
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,860
It's a shame.
-Yes.

396
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,980
Captain!

397
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,660
Good evening, miss.

398
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:55,100
Captain...

399
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,860
A moment please.

400
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:00,220
I'm Berta's father.

401
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:03,540
I'm the father

402
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,660
of your child.

403
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,860
Please...

404
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:12,220
Do you understand?

405
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:26,940
Tie them up. Fast!

406
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:31,060
I came to collect my Laura.

407
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:32,540
We love each other.

408
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,340
Faster!

409
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,620
We leave your house

410
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,340
to live together.

411
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,460
Please, don't be angry.

412
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:42,900
Ready?
-Yes.

413
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,100
Thanks, captain.

414
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,300
I'm the actor.

415
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,340
I know him.

416
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,260
But where from?

417
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,540
Goodbye, captain.

418
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:57,380
You are playing for the germans,

419
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:58,580
bastard!

420
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:09,060
What an actor, my collegue.

421
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,180
Is that electricity?

422
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,860
Sit down!

423
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:56,100
Hands up, traitor!

424
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,300
Hands up!

425
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,340
Is that the robe?

426
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,860
Yes, mister, but...

427
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,780
Uncle Blacky! Sister!

428
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:16,060
Uncle Blacky! Attack!

429
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,940
Do you want my sister?

430
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:29,460
You won't get her!

431
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,980
Hands up, my friend!

432
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:45,340
They will kill my brother!

433
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,780
Blow!

434
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:12,300
I'm not getting married every day!

435
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,740
Congratulations!

436
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,660
Good, Golub. Where is the priest?

437
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,780
On his way. I ordered to get him.

438
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,300
Congratulations, miss.

439
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:21,060
I'm not getting married!

440
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,620
Yes you do, my love.

441
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,700
You don't even know it, that's all.

442
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,500
I destroyed your life by killing

443
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,260
Franz. Thank you, Natalija.

444
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,220
Who will take care of Bato's medicine?

445
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,500
Franz or you?

446
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,180
You give me stolen gold.

447
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:35,820
Stolen from traitors.

448
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,460
Think about it.

449
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:39,860
Listen to me...

450
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:42,380
I never loved anyone like you.

451
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,980
But there are rules.

452
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,700
No collaboration with the enemy.

453
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,940
That's right!
-What the fuck are you saying?

454
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,220
I'm just an actrice.

455
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,100
The backers are also open?

456
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:55,460
Yeah, but you are not the backer's wife!

457
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,140
You don't sell bread.

458
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,980
You sell your soul!

459
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,820
He who sells his soul,

460
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,740
I shall judge myself.

461
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,820
At first I'll kill

462
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,780
your theatre director.

463
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,780
I'll strangle him myself.

464
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,860
Because I love theatre.

465
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:33,100
Congratulations, Mr. Blacky!

466
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,820
Does the dinner eat us,

467
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,820
or we the dinner?

468
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,740
I'm gonna roast that fish!

469
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,940
No problem.

470
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,420
Aren't you ashamed?

471
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,540
Your collegues are nursing the partisans

472
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,940
and you play for these bastards.

473
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,580
It hurts.

474
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:10,500
Oh, does it hurt?

475
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,980
I love you.

476
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,300
Golub!

477
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,580
That fish needs to be roasted.

478
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,820
Come on, I'm going to pee.

479
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:26,460
Guard my fiancee, my friend.

480
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:28,300
Forward!

481
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,140
Marko...

482
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,500
Come on!

483
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:09,660
I don't want to.

484
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,100
I do not want to marry.

485
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:29,020
Don't force me to come

486
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,380
over and clear things out!

487
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,700
Don't fear.

488
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:34,500
You might not know,

489
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,660
but he actually isn't

490
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:39,300
an electrical engineer.

491
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:43,180
He is a simple electrician

492
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,340
who climbs up in the masts.

493
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:48,580
He has been all his life up in the

494
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,700
masts with pincers and clips.

495
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:53,300
I got him out of there.

496
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:56,100
I asked him wether he wanted

497
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,620
to be on our side and he said yes.

498
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,580
"Shall you respect our statutes

499
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,740
and rules?"

500
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:03,940
"Yes"

501
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:07,180
And that way it continued until he got rich.

502
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:09,980
Natalija...

503
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,980
An electrician?

504
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,900
A mast worker!

505
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,780
Natalija,

506
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,740
you are our best actrice

507
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,740
Our people in peril

508
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,220
need you.

509
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,180
You need a man who is

510
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:35,100
reasonable, intelligent,

511
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:37,420
civilized...

512
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,780
An intellectual.

513
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,700
That's true.

514
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,300
Comrade Leka wants you

515
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:58,500
in front of the court martial.

516
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,460
Where are the weapons we have

517
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:01,980
been waiting for for a week?

518
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,700
Here, aboard.

519
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,300
I'll get married and we'll sail off.

520
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:07,460
They'll hear the music in Belgrado.

521
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:09,740
They should. Blacky is getting married.

522
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,300
Enough wining.

523
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:17,140
Aren't these weapons?

524
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:23,420
After the priest marries me, I'll go to

525
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:25,820
the White Rock.I'll be there before you.

526
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,700
Comrade Tito!

527
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:31,500
When will you come to Uzice?

528
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:46,940
"Your hands are so white,

529
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:49,660
so fragile and tender,

530
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:51,460
like the wings of a bird...

531
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,340
If I only could see them fly

532
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,500
and land on my face..."

533
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:15,700
Stop it!

534
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:17,940
Go away!

535
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:22,420
What's this?

536
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:24,860
We were talking about theatre...

537
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:26,980
What? What are you doing?

538
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:29,580
I'll kill you!

539
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,820
No, my good friend!

540
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:38,460
I've killed two men for her

541
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:40,020
I know.

542
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:42,020
Why are you doing this to me?

543
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:43,500
And you...
-It wasn't me.

544
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:45,380
Wasn't that you?

545
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,180
Who then? Me?

546
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:57,500
Are you my best friend?

547
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:59,220
I am your best friend.

548
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:01,020
I didn't hear you.

549
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,980
I am your best friend.

550
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,100
Who's gonna get married?

551
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:06,660
We, my love.

552
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:08,540
We are getting married.
You are getting married.

553
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:11,700
We are getting married, my love.

554
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:13,420
We are getting married, honey.

555
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:19,340
You wanted to drive, no?

556
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,500
Go, stallion!

557
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:48,820
Old chap!

558
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:51,060
Where is that priest?

559
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:53,900
He'll be here soon.

560
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:59,420
Moonshine at noon?

561
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:08,460
Or sunshine at midnight?

562
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:13,300
From heaven above

563
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:15,180
shines a light...

564
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:18,540
The germans! What a disaster!

565
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:20,820
Nobody knows

566
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:22,780
Nobody knows

567
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:25,860
where the light comes from...

568
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:30,260
Together you would be

569
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:32,620
the ideal man!

570
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:35,620
You are getting on my nerves.

571
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:41,020
Get out!

572
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:42,580
And cover yourself!

573
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,860
Left and right from the boat!

574
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,100
Marko!

575
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:56,700
Petar Popara!

576
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,460
Bloody idiots!

577
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:02,180
Your game is out!

578
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:03,180
Franz...

579
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:05,740
Show yourself!

580
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:08,260
And bring Natalija with you

581
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:09,860
or I'll kill you!

582
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:12,900
Didn't I shoot him?

583
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:14,500
No.

584
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:16,300
He wears a bulletproof jacket.

585
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:18,020
Next time aim for his head.

586
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:21,060
I'll smoke another cigarette,

587
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:24,060
and then my patience ends!

588
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:26,660
Then I have to see you.

589
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:30,140
Understood?

590
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:34,580
Don't shoot!

591
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:37,260
Don't shoot!

592
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:39,620
Thank you.

593
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:46,260
What a disaster!

594
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:52,900
My beloved saver!

595
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,420
Honey...

596
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:01,860
Schulz, get out!

597
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:11,420
And finish that

598
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:14,460
criminal scum off quickly!

599
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:17,900
My white dove...

600
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:32,460
Lot's of pleasure, idiots!

601
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:35,500
You won't forget me soon!

602
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:50,420
Shoot, old chap!

603
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:54,740
Golub, don't shoot!

604
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:56,980
What a disaster!

605
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:59,060
Shoot, man!

606
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:13,420
Where are the guns, Blacky?

607
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,940
Where is the train with guns, bastard?

608
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:23,420
Dirty traitor!

609
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:30,420
I'll smash Tito out of your head.

610
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:11,300
And?

611
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:13,620
Does he talk?

612
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:15,260
No.

613
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:17,540
He's only cursing us.

614
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:21,100
Petar Popara...

615
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:24,380
Go to hell, fascist swine.

616
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:31,060
No.

617
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:33,700
Lick my ass.

618
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:36,700
Run the current incrementally up.

619
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:41,420
Marry uncle Blacky, sister.

620
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:43,220
He is the strongest.

621
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,580
Forget uncle Blacky, there comes Franz.

622
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:47,540
He's the strongest of them all.

623
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:49,460
Don't be such an ass.

624
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:52,300
What did he say?

625
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:53,820
He asks

626
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:55,980
when you can leave the hospital

627
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:59,300
Next week.

628
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:03,140
He's going to a sanatorium in Austria.

629
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:05,460
A sanatorium in Austria?

630
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:07,380
There he will be safe.

631
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:09,300
I can't help me here

632
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:11,980
and it's to dangerous for him.

633
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:20,260
Good Morning.

634
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:23,140
Good Morning.

635
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:26,940
Did our young friend

636
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:29,300
throw up tonight?

637
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:32,340
Yes.

638
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:34,820
No.

639
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:37,340
Is it yes...

640
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:40,460
or is it no?

641
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:43,620
I don't know.

642
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:46,220
No, he didn't throw up.

643
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:49,380
Tell me that he doesn't has to worry.

644
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:51,100
Please.

645
00:50:57,940 --> 00:50:59,460
Let him explode!

646
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:02,540
Dirty fascist nazi kraut!

647
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:04,620
Let him go!

648
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:07,220
Let him blow apart

649
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:08,940
like a paper bag!

650
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:13,300
You killed my Franz.

651
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:24,820
Is he dead?

652
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:28,060
Not yet.

653
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:31,820
Forgive me. Franz. I'm sorry.

654
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:44,300
Your Franz can fuck himself! Come on!

655
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:52,700
What's wrong with that piece of crap?

656
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:54,260
Put it on level 5.

657
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:55,860
That's lethal.

658
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:57,660
Lethal? My ass!

659
00:51:57,820 --> 00:51:59,260
Let me try.

660
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:06,540
It doesn't work.

661
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:13,020
Put it on.

662
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:20,620
Colleague...

663
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:26,740
Wake up!

664
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:29,020
Good morning, gentlemen.

665
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:32,700
Everything under control?

666
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:39,140
What's wrong with him?

667
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:40,660
He tested the generator.

668
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:42,900
And did it work?
-Yes, he's dead.

669
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:45,580
But he isn't hurt.

670
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:47,460
He's an electrician.

671
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:49,340
Electrician?

672
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:51,300
A mast worker!

673
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:06,580
Mate! Give me a granade.

674
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:08,740
If they might find me.

675
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:10,420
Here's your granade.

676
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:11,780
Come on!

677
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:17,940
Thank you, Marko.

678
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,820
What piteous, all this loonatics

679
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:25,820
Sure, sure.

680
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:36,420
We are all crazy, Natalija.

681
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:43,580
The only thing is the diagnosis

682
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:46,660
hasn't been said.

683
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:49,700
Where is uncle Blacky?

684
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:52,740
In the basket, my boy.

685
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:54,380
In the basket?

686
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:03,100
Mate?
-In the basket?

687
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:05,700
Uncle Blacky!

688
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:16,420
Bloody fascist swines.

689
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:29,100
Ivan!

690
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:30,980
Golub!

691
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:33,580
Get us bandages.

692
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:35,060
Carry on,old friend.

693
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:37,340
Where is that bandage?!

694
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:40,460
Come and help us...pick Jovan.

695
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:44,900
Get rid of that monkey, Help him!

696
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:54,540
Step harder.

697
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:57,260
We need more light.

698
00:54:57,860 --> 00:54:59,420
Caution for his leg.

699
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:01,260
Comrade Blacky,

700
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:02,780
what did they do?

701
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:05,420
Bloody fascist swines.

702
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:08,580
What a disaster!

703
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:10,620
Jovan...

704
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:12,860
Comrade Marko!

705
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:14,900
Get your granddad, he will cure him.

706
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:17,220
The water of the well his healthy.

707
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:22,020
Bring the weapons to our comrades.

708
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:24,420
Don't worry, I'll do it.

709
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:26,380
Look, here's Jovan.

710
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:29,180
Here's your daddy

711
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:30,980
Let him see his daddy.

712
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:32,580
Jovan...

713
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:37,460
My son...

714
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:44,300
Give your daddy a kiss.

715
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:52,860
Give him a kiss.

716
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:24,020
This room is dedicated to me.

717
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:30,100
My room!

718
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:31,780
Okay...

719
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:33,620
Yes.

720
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:35,900
This room...

721
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:38,500
and the whole house.

722
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:41,060
And the country, heaven and the stars,

723
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:44,060
the sun, the moon, the clouds...

724
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,820
even if it unclouded

725
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:49,940
Is this all mine?

726
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:53,140
Sure, everything.

727
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:10,620
Who is bombing us?

728
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:11,940
The Allies.

729
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:13,860
If it isn't the Germans,

730
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:15,780
it's the Allies.

731
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:18,820
Where are you going?

732
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:21,940
To the cellar.
-Come...

733
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:24,380
Come with me.

734
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:29,940
Are you afraid?

735
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:33,700
Not if I'm with you.

736
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:43,300
Drink.

737
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:44,860
I never drink.

738
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:46,620
Don't be afraid, drink.

739
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:55,260
It's not strong, but gentle.

740
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:56,900
Really.

741
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:13,700
I don't know, sweety,

742
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:15,620
wether this is a dream

743
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:19,100
And what year, which day it is

744
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:22,020
And I don't know,

745
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:24,260
My love,

746
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:26,140
Wether I'm your dream

747
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:28,740
Or you mine...

748
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:33,340
For who did you write that?

749
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:36,100
Tell me.
-For you.

750
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:39,500
You're lying.

751
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:44,420
You are lying
-I'm not

752
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:47,580
You are lying
-I never lie.

753
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:52,060
Never.

754
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:57,140
Marko,

755
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:59,740
you can lie so deliciously.

756
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:19,580
Easter, april 1944

757
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:21,700
The Allies ar bombing

758
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:23,980
what the nazi's had left standing up.

759
01:00:04,620 --> 01:00:06,420
Freedom!

760
01:01:11,740 --> 01:01:13,620
They are trying to steal

761
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:15,580
a part of our country!

762
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:17,020
With the weapons we won

763
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:19,620
the plebiscite and

764
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:22,340
defended the freedom!

765
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:24,460
With weapons we will defend Triëste!

766
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:05,620
Second Part - The Cold War

767
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:08,140
Years go by, Marko became

768
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:10,580
a collaborator of Tito.

769
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:13,100
In 1961 he pays off

770
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:15,140
his debts to Blacky.

771
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:34,340
Comrade Marko...

772
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:35,980
I ask you once more

773
01:02:36,140 --> 01:02:38,140
wether comrade Natalija can

774
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:39,940
play in my movie.
-No.

775
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:42,540
But I'm filming you memoires,

776
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:44,780
and she is our greatest actress.

777
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:45,780
Exactly.

778
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:48,100
The movie is dedicated to the revolution,

779
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:49,780
not to us.

780
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:51,580
Do you want to honour us

781
01:02:51,740 --> 01:02:53,620
with a visit during the filming?

782
01:02:53,780 --> 01:02:54,780
Sure.

783
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:57,140
Comrades,

784
01:02:57,540 --> 01:02:59,060
I have the great honour

785
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:01,660
to open this Cultural Centre

786
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:03,940
with a statue of our hero

787
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:06,180
Petar Popara Blacky.

788
01:03:07,060 --> 01:03:08,420
Blacky symbolizes

789
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:10,820
our battle against the fascists.

790
01:03:11,260 --> 01:03:13,980
He will live eternally in the hearts

791
01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:15,860
of his friends,

792
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:17,740
his battle comrades,

793
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:19,980
and of the generations to come

794
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:22,460
which will come from childhood on

795
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:24,540
to this Centre to find

796
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:27,740
inspiration from this believe

797
01:03:28,220 --> 01:03:29,860
for which our brother,

798
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:32,820
our comrade, our friend,

799
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:35,300
our Blacky

800
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:37,300
gave his life and youth.

801
01:03:55,060 --> 01:03:56,780
I'll use this opportunity,

802
01:03:56,940 --> 01:03:58,940
allthough I waste some of your time,

803
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:00,580
to bring you some poems

804
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:02,780
from my last poetry book

805
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:04,620
about the Freedom Battle.

806
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:14,060
Why is the wind always blowing

807
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:16,780
If we are commemorate our beloved?

808
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:20,020
Why does the wind hit the windows

809
01:04:20,180 --> 01:04:22,540
And the doors of our brothers?

810
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:26,300
Is it only the wind that blows

811
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:29,500
Or howls the heaven with us?

812
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:33,140
Petar Popara Blacky, our friend,

813
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:34,700
glory to you!

814
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:36,900
Glory to him!

815
01:04:41,740 --> 01:04:45,780
Moonshine at noon?

816
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:51,100
Sunshine at midnight?

817
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:53,980
From the heaven up there

818
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:55,980
Shines a light

819
01:04:56,140 --> 01:04:58,820
Nobody knows...

820
01:05:30,580 --> 01:05:32,420
The sovjet divisions

821
01:05:32,580 --> 01:05:33,780
are surrounded.

822
01:05:33,940 --> 01:05:36,220
The units of general Von Kleist

823
01:05:36,620 --> 01:05:38,460
have broken through...

824
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:42,980
Continue, sister.

825
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:51,660
More light!

826
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:55,100
Daddy!

827
01:06:00,220 --> 01:06:02,300
Bring some water!

828
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:05,540
What has happened?

829
01:06:05,780 --> 01:06:07,460
It's okay.

830
01:06:07,620 --> 01:06:09,540
The gestapo got me.

831
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:11,140
Bloody fascist swines

832
01:06:11,420 --> 01:06:13,780
Bloody fascist swines!

833
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:17,660
Marko, let me out

834
01:06:17,820 --> 01:06:20,380
and in 3 days the war ends.

835
01:06:20,540 --> 01:06:21,380
Not yet.

836
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:22,940
Where are you waiting for?

837
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:25,380
Tito asked you to wait.

838
01:06:25,660 --> 01:06:27,180
Tito?

839
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:33,540
He said:

840
01:06:34,180 --> 01:06:35,860
"Greet Blacky from me

841
01:06:36,020 --> 01:06:37,620
and tell him to wait.

842
01:06:38,180 --> 01:06:40,580
I want to spare him for the last battle."

843
01:06:40,860 --> 01:06:42,700
Did he say that?
-Literally.

844
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:45,100
He asked me to give you this watch.

845
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:54,740
Ho, Marko, I can't...

846
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:56,380
with a mission.

847
01:06:56,540 --> 01:06:57,500
For me?

848
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:03,460
For you.

849
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:15,460
Comrade Tito

850
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:19,020
We promise you formally

851
01:07:21,540 --> 01:07:23,780
We promise you formally

852
01:07:27,020 --> 01:07:30,140
Comrade Tito

853
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:32,940
We promise you formally

854
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:43,620
That we'll never depart

855
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:47,780
from the path you showed us

856
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:54,620
Comrade Tito

857
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:57,180
Hope of the people

858
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:28,100
You are beloved

859
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:31,620
by old

860
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:36,260
and youth

861
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:41,380
Comrade Tito

862
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:44,180
Our spring flower

863
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:52,540
Serbia

864
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:55,700
Shall never forget you

865
01:09:02,580 --> 01:09:05,780
a blue violet

866
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:10,860
blossomed

867
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:17,620
on the pillow

868
01:09:17,780 --> 01:09:20,100
of comrade Tito...

869
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:32,420
Congratulations, Blacky.

870
01:09:32,580 --> 01:09:34,300
Shake hands with comrade Marko.

871
01:09:34,460 --> 01:09:36,860
Not with me. Comrade Marko.

872
01:09:46,660 --> 01:09:49,220
Are we washing ourselves?
-Yes.

873
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:53,620
And our business, grandpa?

874
01:09:53,780 --> 01:09:55,700
It's... difficult

875
01:09:57,940 --> 01:09:59,940
Are you watching the time?

876
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:01,940
I turn the hours back,

877
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:03,340
as you told me to do.

878
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:05,780
Six hours a day.

879
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:08,940
Do not exagerate to much.

880
01:10:09,380 --> 01:10:11,100
On 20 years time

881
01:10:11,260 --> 01:10:13,300
I have saved them 5 years.

882
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:14,700
Can you imagine

883
01:10:14,860 --> 01:10:16,700
what that means...

884
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:19,300
5 years less in a cellar.

885
01:10:56,380 --> 01:10:57,620
Air strike!

886
01:10:57,780 --> 01:10:59,180
Fast, comrades!

887
01:11:02,020 --> 01:11:04,020
Hurry up! Leave the guns!

888
01:11:04,180 --> 01:11:06,060
Everybody in the tank!

889
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:08,540
The enemy is attacking again!

890
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:09,860
No panic!

891
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:11,220
What are you doing, moron?

892
01:11:14,780 --> 01:11:16,940
Come on, idiot!

893
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:19,900
You'll kill us all.

894
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:25,140
Quick!

895
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:49,340
Comrade Tito

896
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:51,500
We promise you formally...

897
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:07,420
Tito, Tito, Tito!

898
01:12:07,580 --> 01:12:09,780
Everybody was singing

899
01:12:09,940 --> 01:12:12,260
and thinking that outside

900
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:14,860
the fascists of World War II

901
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:16,700
were still at reign.

902
01:12:42,460 --> 01:12:45,220
What are you doing, Marko?

903
01:12:47,820 --> 01:12:49,780
You'll see.

904
01:13:31,220 --> 01:13:33,140
Ringe, ringe, raja

905
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:35,140
Here comes uncle Paja...

906
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:46,100
And now?

907
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:49,580
Natalija!

908
01:15:07,340 --> 01:15:09,860
Natalija, spring is coming

909
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:11,940
on a snow white horse!

910
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:13,540
Stop! Stop! Cut!

911
01:15:17,820 --> 01:15:20,340
Stop? Why are you cutting?

912
01:15:20,620 --> 01:15:22,260
Yugoslav, dammit!

913
01:15:22,420 --> 01:15:23,900
Are you calling this rain?

914
01:15:24,180 --> 01:15:26,100
"Stop! Stop!"

915
01:15:26,260 --> 01:15:28,980
Can you never say "Play"?

916
01:15:30,980 --> 01:15:32,660
Thanks, people. Take a break.

917
01:15:32,940 --> 01:15:34,940
The water has to flow!

918
01:15:38,260 --> 01:15:40,460
There he is! Music!

919
01:16:09,380 --> 01:16:11,100
"The spring comes",

920
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:12,860
scene 34a, second take

921
01:16:13,140 --> 01:16:14,420
Action!

922
01:16:15,220 --> 01:16:16,780
The Germans!

923
01:16:26,220 --> 01:16:27,860
Natalija, honey!

924
01:16:28,020 --> 01:16:29,580
The spring comes

925
01:16:29,740 --> 01:16:31,580
on a snow white horse!

926
01:16:46,660 --> 01:16:48,180
I am being raped!

927
01:16:56,820 --> 01:16:58,820
Nobody gets

928
01:16:58,980 --> 01:17:02,020
Petar Popara alias Blacky!

929
01:17:02,380 --> 01:17:04,100
Natalija!

930
01:17:30,620 --> 01:17:32,900
Long live the Communist Party

931
01:17:33,060 --> 01:17:34,740
of Yugoslavia!

932
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:38,540
I'm being raped!

933
01:17:41,860 --> 01:17:43,780
Cut!

934
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:46,780
Comrade, Marko!

935
01:17:48,780 --> 01:17:50,580
Get up, all of you!

936
01:17:51,020 --> 01:17:52,580
Stop the rain!

937
01:17:52,860 --> 01:17:54,620
Comrades artists,

938
01:17:54,780 --> 01:17:57,020
work full of despair

939
01:17:57,740 --> 01:17:59,420
You interprete...

940
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:02,980
great men

941
01:18:03,140 --> 01:18:05,060
who are no longer amongst us.

942
01:18:05,340 --> 01:18:06,940
Let's honour them.

943
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:09,500
Never will they be forgotten.

944
01:18:09,780 --> 01:18:12,420
To a long life, comrades!

945
01:18:15,740 --> 01:18:17,220
Music!

946
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:39,100
Cheers, comrade Marko!

947
01:18:40,860 --> 01:18:42,660
Comrade Marko,

948
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:45,180
let me introduce you to

949
01:18:45,340 --> 01:18:47,100
the heroes from your memoires.

950
01:18:52,020 --> 01:18:53,780
Not now!

951
01:19:00,980 --> 01:19:02,780
Who are you?

952
01:19:03,860 --> 01:19:05,100
Marko!

953
01:19:05,260 --> 01:19:06,740
Yes, I am you.

954
01:19:09,780 --> 01:19:11,780
Amazing...

955
01:19:16,780 --> 01:19:18,660
Exactly my portrait.

956
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:20,860
Where did you find these people?

957
01:19:21,020 --> 01:19:23,060
The casting is half of the work.

958
01:19:23,220 --> 01:19:25,140
True. Unbelievable.

959
01:19:25,420 --> 01:19:27,620
We exchanged our books

960
01:19:27,780 --> 01:19:29,340
for rifles from the same wood.

961
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:33,060
Shoot, my rifle,

962
01:19:33,220 --> 01:19:34,780
So that mother hears.

963
01:19:34,940 --> 01:19:36,700
Never will I give my country up

964
01:19:36,860 --> 01:19:38,580
To the enemy.

965
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:40,220
Come on, say something.

966
01:19:42,180 --> 01:19:44,540
Well?
-She is nice.

967
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:46,220
Sure she is.

968
01:19:48,180 --> 01:19:49,460
Franz?

969
01:19:49,620 --> 01:19:51,060
Franz the vampyre.

970
01:19:52,180 --> 01:19:54,940
Very beautiful, but I got the impression

971
01:19:55,100 --> 01:19:56,860
that someone is missing.

972
01:19:57,140 --> 01:19:59,620
Is this the real Franz or an actor?

973
01:19:59,780 --> 01:20:01,300
Who knows?

974
01:20:01,460 --> 01:20:02,940
An actor.

975
01:20:04,420 --> 01:20:06,100
Yes, an actor.

976
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:07,820
Unbelievable.

977
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:09,660
Everything is just like it was back then.

978
01:20:09,820 --> 01:20:11,940
When you killed eleven Germans,

979
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:13,660
dived...
-What a memory.

980
01:20:13,820 --> 01:20:15,860
...and Blacky and Natalija saved.

981
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:18,140
True, true.

982
01:20:20,420 --> 01:20:21,820
Excuse me.

983
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:26,260
Blacky!

984
01:20:41,020 --> 01:20:42,620
My friend!

985
01:20:43,740 --> 01:20:45,940
God, Blacky.

986
01:20:47,180 --> 01:20:49,980
Why did they have to kill you?

987
01:20:50,140 --> 01:20:51,500
Why?

988
01:20:53,180 --> 01:20:54,340
Comrade Marko,

989
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:56,420
can't you protect the actors?

990
01:20:56,580 --> 01:20:58,860
I got burnt for the third time.

991
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:00,460
Three times!

992
01:21:14,060 --> 01:21:15,300
Comrade Marko,

993
01:21:15,460 --> 01:21:17,500
it will be an awesome movie!

994
01:21:28,820 --> 01:21:30,420
Are you afraid for God?

995
01:21:30,580 --> 01:21:32,780
Are we afraid for God, you mean.

996
01:21:43,060 --> 01:21:44,860
You should better

997
01:21:45,020 --> 01:21:46,500
learn your script.

998
01:21:46,660 --> 01:21:48,780
Literally.

999
01:21:48,940 --> 01:21:50,100
Understood?

1000
01:22:13,700 --> 01:22:15,380
Goodnight.
