1
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,690
Mama, it's so cold.

2
00:00:36,725 --> 00:00:42,095
It's very, very cold, Will.
Put another log on the fire, lad.

3
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:45,967
There isn't any more firewood, Mama.

4
00:00:47,828 --> 00:00:50,854
Don't worry, Ma.
Jake'll be back soon.

5
00:00:50,889 --> 00:00:53,398
He'll have money for a doctor.

6
00:01:01,268 --> 00:01:03,761
- Did you sell the cow?
- You'll never believe it.

7
00:01:03,796 --> 00:01:07,857
- How much did you get?
- I met a stranger on the road.

8
00:01:07,892 --> 00:01:09,595
Beans?

9
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,215
Magic beans.

10
00:01:11,252 --> 00:01:13,812
- Oh, Jacob.
- Beans?!

11
00:01:13,813 --> 00:01:17,579
He said that they'd make Lotte better
and we'd live happily ever after.

12
00:01:17,614 --> 00:01:21,638
And you believed it? You believed it?!
You idiot! You idiot, Jake!

13
00:01:21,673 --> 00:01:25,663
- She's gonna die because of you!
- Boys, think of your poor sister!

14
00:02:10,548 --> 00:02:12,209
<i>Arrêtez!</i>

15
00:02:12,212 --> 00:02:14,578
Where do you come from, mein Herr?

16
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,048
Kassel, near Frankfurt.

17
00:02:18,324 --> 00:02:21,293
Monsieur, we're looking
for food and lodging.

18
00:02:23,636 --> 00:02:25,228
<i>Passez. </i>

19
00:02:25,236 --> 00:02:27,185
<i>Merci à vous. </i>

20
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,381
<i>Au revoir. Monsieur. </i>

21
00:02:38,388 --> 00:02:43,451
A little something, sir?
Help an old soldier. Help an old soldier, sir.

22
00:02:43,486 --> 00:02:45,783
Oh, thank you.
Thank you, sir.

23
00:02:45,818 --> 00:02:48,081
God bless you, sir.
God bless you.

24
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:50,245
Ah!

25
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,023
Oh, God bless you.

26
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:58,301
- Groom your horses for half a franc.
- Do you know the mayor of this town?

27
00:02:58,336 --> 00:03:00,219
Only groom for the best, sir.

28
00:03:00,948 --> 00:03:03,075
Then give him this.

29
00:03:05,972 --> 00:03:08,295
The Brothers Grimm?

30
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,577
Every second counts.

31
00:03:10,612 --> 00:03:16,312
The witch comes in the dead
of night, when the moon is well-hid.

32
00:03:16,347 --> 00:03:21,381
She comes out of
the darkest, coldest blackness.

33
00:03:25,652 --> 00:03:29,850
Her cry would freeze
the very blood in your veins.

34
00:03:29,885 --> 00:03:32,239
You were right to send for us.

35
00:03:33,268 --> 00:03:37,105
- How many here have seen her?
- Everyone who lives by the mill stream.

36
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:42,908
It was a hundred years ago. The miller's
wife was burned at the stake for witchcraft,

37
00:03:42,943 --> 00:03:45,265
and they tossed her charred bones
into the river.

38
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,401
Her remains should have been
sealed in a mirror-lined box.

39
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:54,306
Well, for nights thereafter children saw her
walk the riverbank, beckoning them to her.

40
00:03:54,341 --> 00:03:58,232
- Many did. The mill witch of Karlstadt.
- Yes. We know the legend.

41
00:03:58,267 --> 00:04:02,124
- Then you believe us?
- I'd believe anything you choose to tell me.

42
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,329
Come to my mill.
Such ungodly horrors!

43
00:04:05,364 --> 00:04:09,323
Such banshees screeching.
And if you dare set eyes upon...

44
00:04:09,358 --> 00:04:11,377
Shut up!
Give him his medicine.

45
00:04:11,412 --> 00:04:14,540
Brothers Grimm, we're at our wit's end.

46
00:04:14,575 --> 00:04:17,023
What can you do for us?

47
00:04:17,058 --> 00:04:19,409
It's difficult. Jake?

48
00:04:19,444 --> 00:04:22,385
When you burn a witch,
her soul burns eternally,

49
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:26,754
so the exorcism of witches
requires a very special method.

50
00:04:27,252 --> 00:04:29,809
- And expensive.
- Only an arrow of innocent tears,

51
00:04:29,844 --> 00:04:33,871
that is child's tears, shot directly
through the heart can put out that fire.

52
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:38,065
That's the theory.
This is no ordinary witch.

53
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:42,594
But we've got no one else to turn to.
Can't you help us?

54
00:04:50,516 --> 00:04:53,212
How much?

55
00:04:58,804 --> 00:05:01,568
- You're doing the right thing.
- I hope so.

56
00:05:28,532 --> 00:05:31,057
Whatever happens,
stay behind that shield.

57
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,996
The armor was forged by Prince Richard
the Charming, who awoke Brier-Rose.

58
00:05:35,031 --> 00:05:39,028
- Thank you.
- It reflects the powers of evil.

59
00:05:39,063 --> 00:05:41,041
- Most of the time.
- Right.

60
00:05:41,076 --> 00:05:44,341
- Surprise is critical.
- She mustn't detect us until we're...

61
00:05:48,627 --> 00:05:51,221
...ready for her.

62
00:05:51,256 --> 00:05:53,349
- Hold that.
- Positions.

63
00:05:56,307 --> 00:05:57,433
- Will?
- Ready.

64
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,587
Three, two, one.

65
00:06:04,148 --> 00:06:05,615
Huh?

66
00:06:07,796 --> 00:06:11,197
She's trying to bring the whole place down.

67
00:06:15,155 --> 00:06:16,213
Run!

68
00:06:18,452 --> 00:06:20,624
Take a shot, Jake!

69
00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:23,408
She's here!
She's here! She's here!

70
00:06:23,443 --> 00:06:26,344
- I can't see the heart, Will.
- Lucifer!

71
00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:28,783
Get ahold of yourself, man.

72
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:35,350
The Brothers Grimm do not fear you.

73
00:06:38,772 --> 00:06:41,400
Reload, Jake.
Don't look her in the eyes.

74
00:06:44,884 --> 00:06:46,784
- Shoot, Jake.
- Something's wrong.

75
00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:49,137
Hit her in the heart.

76
00:06:49,172 --> 00:06:51,231
- It won't release!
- Don't look in her eyes.

77
00:06:51,266 --> 00:06:52,687
- What?
- Not the eyes.

78
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,078
She's got control over it, Will.

79
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,282
- Fight her, Jacob.
- I can't, Will!

80
00:07:05,044 --> 00:07:06,534
We're brothers, dammit.

81
00:07:08,404 --> 00:07:11,089
Be a Grimm and fight.

82
00:07:11,124 --> 00:07:15,185
We've killed worse than you!

83
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,923
Argh!

84
00:07:21,428 --> 00:07:24,158
Down! Down!
Down! Down! Down!

85
00:07:40,724 --> 00:07:44,125
Stay back.
Back. She's trying to escape.

86
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:50,577
All souls take corporeal forms,
and when they fail they find places to hide.

87
00:07:51,316 --> 00:07:55,946
Seal these in a mirror-lined box
and bury them far from any river,

88
00:07:55,981 --> 00:07:57,819
and your witch will be gone for good.

89
00:07:57,854 --> 00:07:59,439
You're a brave man.

90
00:07:59,443 --> 00:08:01,570
Take the bag.

91
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:05,680
Bless you, brothers.
Bless you.

92
00:08:05,715 --> 00:08:09,412
Whoa. We had
a legally binding agreement.

93
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:12,133
Oh, yes. Yes.
Of course.

94
00:08:12,168 --> 00:08:14,819
Thank you. Thank you.

95
00:08:15,572 --> 00:08:18,225
She... She is dead?

96
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,209
- Yeah, very.
- Course she is.

97
00:08:20,244 --> 00:08:24,237
She's dead.
I must tell the whole town.

98
00:08:24,272 --> 00:08:28,140
She's dead.
Our witch is dead!

99
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:36,243
That one was a bit of a nightmare.

100
00:08:38,132 --> 00:08:40,327
Don't give me that look.

101
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:43,328
- I was a scholar once, Will.
- Yeah, now you're famous.

102
00:08:43,363 --> 00:08:46,316
All the girls know your name.
What do you want? An apology?

103
00:08:50,452 --> 00:08:52,145
Blithering idiot!

104
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:55,047
Your mother was a toothless cow!

105
00:08:55,082 --> 00:08:57,794
Get me down.
Get me down!

106
00:08:58,228 --> 00:09:00,400
Sorry, Hidlick. Slipped.

107
00:09:00,435 --> 00:09:02,903
Fat Christ! What are you doing?
Trying to kill us?

108
00:09:02,938 --> 00:09:05,359
Weren't we supposed to?

109
00:09:12,596 --> 00:09:15,441
God-awful smoke!
You know, just once...

110
00:09:15,476 --> 00:09:18,934
Just once, I'd like to sell it
on the strength of my performance.

111
00:09:18,969 --> 00:09:20,912
Bunst.

112
00:09:20,947 --> 00:09:23,211
Watch out for the...

113
00:09:23,246 --> 00:09:25,649
snap boards.

114
00:09:25,684 --> 00:09:29,586
We do all the flying, the burning, the
scaring, what do we have to show for it?

115
00:09:29,621 --> 00:09:30,856
Talk to Will.

116
00:09:30,868 --> 00:09:34,129
- One tenth. Just like God.
- Exactly, one tenth.

117
00:09:34,164 --> 00:09:37,796
And for the rest, all you have to do
is ride into town and smile.

118
00:09:37,831 --> 00:09:41,428
Yes, well, talk to Napoleon.
Organize your labor, start a guild.

119
00:09:41,463 --> 00:09:44,267
There are two of us. Hm?

120
00:09:44,302 --> 00:09:46,271
Two times ten. Hm?

121
00:09:46,292 --> 00:09:48,226
- We want a twentieth.
- A twentieth?

122
00:09:48,261 --> 00:09:50,180
Each.

123
00:09:53,652 --> 00:09:55,376
Done.

124
00:09:55,411 --> 00:09:57,904
Shrewd thespians.
Now, here's the plan.

125
00:09:57,939 --> 00:10:00,561
Have a couple of days' rest
then meet us in Hamburg.

126
00:10:00,596 --> 00:10:05,898
- Jake knows a legend of a bridge troll.
- Bridge troll. Yes!

127
00:10:05,933 --> 00:10:09,439
How comes he does the monsters,
I play the girlie ghosts?

128
00:10:09,474 --> 00:10:12,945
Because you, my friend, have talent.
You've got range.

129
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,752
What do I have, Will?

130
00:10:14,772 --> 00:10:17,873
You, my handsome friend, have heart.

131
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:23,175
You, bro, have enough bullshit
to fill the palace of Versailles.

132
00:10:24,211 --> 00:10:29,012
Right. You want the truth of it, boys?
It's a short, brutish struggle, then you die.

133
00:10:29,047 --> 00:10:32,615
Life's little subterfuges
make it all worthwhile.

134
00:10:33,428 --> 00:10:34,486
Well...

135
00:10:38,099 --> 00:10:39,930
Your half, Professor.

136
00:10:39,965 --> 00:10:40,912
Oh.

137
00:10:40,948 --> 00:10:43,940
Would you prefer this in magic beans?

138
00:10:45,075 --> 00:10:48,067
I'll take the beans, thanks, Will.

139
00:10:48,102 --> 00:10:50,019
Stupid!

140
00:12:22,356 --> 00:12:24,017
Who's there?

141
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,313
Hey!

142
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:31,459
Can you hear me?

143
00:12:35,219 --> 00:12:37,210
Where are you?

144
00:12:44,883 --> 00:12:47,984
Yes, we stood together.
Honestly.

145
00:12:48,019 --> 00:12:51,182
And you were very, very brave,
weren't you?

146
00:12:51,217 --> 00:12:53,854
Who's a brave miller?
You are.

147
00:12:58,452 --> 00:13:00,317
Drink up, dear boy.

148
00:13:02,292 --> 00:13:05,360
Will Grimm. Shall we?

149
00:13:05,395 --> 00:13:08,831
Nothing comes between us brothers.
Not wicked witches.

150
00:13:08,866 --> 00:13:12,817
No. And not vicious beasts in disguise.

151
00:13:12,852 --> 00:13:16,489
And not murderous queens.
No.

152
00:13:16,524 --> 00:13:19,664
Not even Godfather Death.

153
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:25,695
Because only the truest of truthful love
could ever beat the Grim Reaper.

154
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:28,493
- Isn't that right, Will?
- Absolutely!

155
00:13:28,528 --> 00:13:30,289
The Grim Reaper!

156
00:13:30,324 --> 00:13:34,000
Oh, I've got a story, I've got a story.
Shush. Shush.

157
00:13:34,035 --> 00:13:37,605
Once upon a time there was an imp
whose name we had to guess.

158
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,175
We had to go right down to
the flaming belly of hell to find out.

159
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:43,504
But we did it. We did it!

160
00:13:43,539 --> 00:13:47,532
I can tell you what. This business is quite
a lucrative one. Know what I mean?

161
00:13:47,567 --> 00:13:50,880
There is definitely money
to be made in witches.

162
00:13:50,915 --> 00:13:52,496
Jake!

163
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:56,433
- He can't hold his ale.
- I can't hold my ale!

164
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:11,042
German pigs!

165
00:14:15,379 --> 00:14:17,108
Bloody French.

166
00:14:18,099 --> 00:14:21,398
Oh, kiss a froggie
and he'll turn into a prince.

167
00:14:21,433 --> 00:14:22,889
Stop it, Jake.

168
00:14:22,899 --> 00:14:25,231
Stop it. You're drunk.
Shut up.

169
00:14:30,259 --> 00:14:32,159
Hello. <i>Bonsoir. </i>

170
00:14:33,043 --> 00:14:35,068
Something full-blooded.

171
00:14:35,091 --> 00:14:37,651
Perhaps a gorgeous
Châteauneuf-du-Pape.

172
00:14:37,686 --> 00:14:40,552
Come on. 1792.

173
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:42,736
A very good year.

174
00:14:42,771 --> 00:14:47,333
<i> Vive la révolution. </i>

175
00:14:47,368 --> 00:14:50,280
On the house.
Oh, no. Don't be too hasty, my friend.

176
00:14:50,315 --> 00:14:53,904
Better to let something like that breathe.

177
00:14:53,939 --> 00:14:56,339
That's the weak piss
Hans brews in the basement.

178
00:14:56,374 --> 00:14:59,708
Nice one. Nice one. So... Ow!

179
00:15:01,684 --> 00:15:04,560
Well, the music seems
to have turned horribly French.

180
00:15:04,595 --> 00:15:09,032
Shall we continue
our little philosophical discussion upstairs?

181
00:15:09,067 --> 00:15:11,439
What do you say, Jake?
A little chit, a little chat.

182
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:14,970
A little huff, a little puff,
thank you very much, Will.

183
00:15:15,005 --> 00:15:16,784
There he goes.

184
00:15:16,819 --> 00:15:22,815
Mythical damsels and princesses
are all he's really concerned with.

185
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:25,808
Very well, then. Magic awaits.

186
00:15:25,843 --> 00:15:27,952
I know, we can play my favorite game.

187
00:15:27,987 --> 00:15:31,650
It's called Who's the Fairest of Them All?

188
00:15:31,685 --> 00:15:34,301
Beans, Jake. Beans.

189
00:15:35,124 --> 00:15:36,751
Beans!

190
00:15:36,787 --> 00:15:38,414
Ah, you're an idiot!

191
00:15:38,451 --> 00:15:41,909
Wait for me, now, ladies.
I'm coming. I'm coming.

192
00:15:46,163 --> 00:15:47,721
Beans.

193
00:15:47,731 --> 00:15:50,399
Will, they're magic beans.

194
00:15:50,434 --> 00:15:52,977
No, they're magic beans, Will.

195
00:15:53,012 --> 00:15:58,279
And the giants will crush you
and rip out your heart.

196
00:15:59,997 --> 00:16:01,013
Shh!

197
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:03,205
<i>Gute Nacht. Herr Grimm. </i>

198
00:16:07,731 --> 00:16:09,926
Grimm!

199
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,592
Ik, ik, ak, ek, ek.

200
00:16:12,627 --> 00:16:16,085
- What's going on?
- How can you speak in this language?

201
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,988
Every word is like an execution.

202
00:16:21,395 --> 00:16:23,836
<i>Benne. Benne. </i>

203
00:16:23,871 --> 00:16:26,277
Your horses are ready.

204
00:16:26,312 --> 00:16:27,751
<i>Avanti!</i>

205
00:16:33,332 --> 00:16:36,927
You've got a rope
tied around your foot.

206
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:37,749
<i>Ciao. </i>

207
00:16:57,075 --> 00:16:59,377
- Run!
- Will! Will, wait!

208
00:16:59,412 --> 00:17:01,880
- Never fear, Jake.
- Will!

209
00:17:01,915 --> 00:17:02,864
Will!

210
00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:05,163
I shall return for you.

211
00:17:08,275 --> 00:17:09,742
Nice try.

212
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,872
Hey, hey! Heagh!

213
00:17:17,523 --> 00:17:21,117
Signore, with bounteous pleasure,

214
00:17:21,152 --> 00:17:24,711
I, Mercurio Cavaldi, present to you

215
00:17:24,746 --> 00:17:27,191
the renowned, the legendary,

216
00:17:27,226 --> 00:17:29,585
the General Vavarin Delatombe,

217
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:34,683
the military commander of the kingdom
of Westphalia, formerly known as...

218
00:17:34,718 --> 00:17:36,811
- No, no, no.
... Hesse.

219
00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:40,675
Exactly what am I enduring here?

220
00:17:41,715 --> 00:17:45,242
Can someone please tell me
who gave birth to this?

221
00:17:45,277 --> 00:17:48,695
It's Bavarian blood sausage,
with sauerkraut.

222
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:50,786
I gutted the pig myself.

223
00:17:52,564 --> 00:17:54,896
- I bet you did.
- Grimmy,

224
00:17:54,931 --> 00:17:57,836
you are to have to stand trial

225
00:17:57,871 --> 00:18:01,044
for subterfuge, theft,

226
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:03,218
and buggery.

227
00:18:03,253 --> 00:18:05,296
I'm sorry?

228
00:18:05,331 --> 00:18:09,165
For which the minimum sentence is...

229
00:18:11,571 --> 00:18:14,576
- Death.
- Oh, no, no. Hang on.

230
00:18:14,611 --> 00:18:18,445
- That's absolutely unnecessary.
- There's been a mistake here.

231
00:18:20,339 --> 00:18:23,617
These country people, they believe things.

232
00:18:23,652 --> 00:18:26,896
We do this just to test them for science.

233
00:18:29,396 --> 00:18:32,422
- Stop. Stop it.
- Ow.

234
00:18:32,457 --> 00:18:34,362
No, no, no.

235
00:18:48,275 --> 00:18:50,544
Are those... snails?

236
00:18:50,579 --> 00:18:53,946
- Snails.
- Your friends have told us everything.

237
00:18:53,981 --> 00:18:56,208
Everything except one thing.

238
00:18:56,243 --> 00:18:59,248
Where are the children of Marbaden?

239
00:18:59,283 --> 00:19:05,449
- What children?
- Nine cute little <i>bambini</i> gone! Vanished.

240
00:19:05,484 --> 00:19:07,258
- We've never been to Marbaden.
- No.

241
00:19:07,293 --> 00:19:10,015
Open up the cauldron.

242
00:19:12,307 --> 00:19:14,864
- No, no. Wait, no!
- Wait, wait!

243
00:19:14,899 --> 00:19:17,136
- I haven't done anything. Please.
- Please!

244
00:19:17,171 --> 00:19:20,299
- By my honor I swear. I swear!
- We didn't do it!

245
00:19:20,334 --> 00:19:22,064
Of course you didn't.

246
00:19:22,099 --> 00:19:24,431
We have been observing you
for some time.

247
00:19:24,466 --> 00:19:26,303
Cavaldi, stop.

248
00:19:26,338 --> 00:19:27,759
Huh?

249
00:19:29,587 --> 00:19:31,851
Please.

250
00:19:38,259 --> 00:19:40,284
No, he said stop it!

251
00:19:44,531 --> 00:19:48,627
However, someone in Marbaden
is working as you.

252
00:19:48,662 --> 00:19:51,663
Same talents, same tricks.

253
00:19:51,698 --> 00:19:54,665
It is a thorn in my toe.

254
00:19:55,187 --> 00:19:59,920
You pull it out,
I might be persuaded to offer you amnesty.

255
00:20:00,755 --> 00:20:03,483
So you mean, if we work for you...

256
00:20:03,518 --> 00:20:06,212
- That's right, Jacob.
... French?

257
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:08,299
<i>Bien sûr. </i>

258
00:20:08,334 --> 00:20:10,352
Go to Marbaden.

259
00:20:10,355 --> 00:20:12,890
Unmask these villains.

260
00:20:12,925 --> 00:20:15,425
Find the missing children.

261
00:20:18,611 --> 00:20:22,172
Hans, we have to stay
where we can still see the village.

262
00:20:22,207 --> 00:20:24,361
Not if we're going to find the missing girls.

263
00:20:24,371 --> 00:20:26,339
We're going too far.

264
00:20:26,355 --> 00:20:29,744
Greta, nothing has ever happened
to anyone in daytime.

265
00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:35,740
And in the very middle of the wood
was the witch's gingerbread house.

266
00:20:50,323 --> 00:20:52,314
Hans!

267
00:21:15,667 --> 00:21:18,067
Hey! Come back!

268
00:21:22,995 --> 00:21:24,986
Got ya!

269
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:38,873
Greta! Greta!

270
00:23:00,506 --> 00:23:04,066
Lieutenant, keep your eyes open.

271
00:23:04,101 --> 00:23:06,817
Sergeant, they are mine.

272
00:23:10,899 --> 00:23:14,704
You go and sell

273
00:23:14,739 --> 00:23:17,207
your oil of snake, Grimmy.

274
00:23:27,635 --> 00:23:29,694
Good people of M... Agh!

275
00:23:29,729 --> 00:23:31,445
It was a long trip.

276
00:23:32,562 --> 00:23:35,122
People of Marbaden.

277
00:23:35,123 --> 00:23:37,182
Hello. Anyone there?

278
00:23:39,282 --> 00:23:41,375
Anybody there?

279
00:23:42,707 --> 00:23:44,038
Say, brother.

280
00:23:44,051 --> 00:23:47,987
Why don't you have a look round? Make
sure there's no French soldiers anywhere.

281
00:23:48,022 --> 00:23:50,223
We wouldn't want to run into any French...

282
00:23:50,258 --> 00:23:52,094
Oh. Hey, morning. Hello.

283
00:23:52,129 --> 00:23:54,347
Will, there's a...

284
00:23:54,382 --> 00:23:55,950
Ah. Morning.

285
00:23:57,971 --> 00:23:59,131
- What..?
- Hello.

286
00:24:04,275 --> 00:24:05,833
Who are you?

287
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:08,139
- Allow me.
- Uh...

288
00:24:08,595 --> 00:24:11,564
Grimm is the name. Two <i>m</i>s.

289
00:24:12,307 --> 00:24:14,400
We are the Brothers Grimm.

290
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:20,959
- They don't know who we are.
- Stand aside, Gregor.

291
00:24:20,994 --> 00:24:22,835
I'll deal with this.

292
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:24,676
What's your business?

293
00:24:24,691 --> 00:24:27,524
We're here to save your land
from evil enchantments.

294
00:24:28,755 --> 00:24:32,589
Too late.
The old ways have returned.

295
00:24:35,283 --> 00:24:37,376
You handle it, Jake.

296
00:24:37,411 --> 00:24:38,853
Uh...

297
00:24:38,867 --> 00:24:42,064
Well, we're from Kassel, near Frankfurt.

298
00:24:42,931 --> 00:24:46,247
- We've heard about your missing children.
- Food for trolls.

299
00:24:46,282 --> 00:24:49,564
Hold your tongue, you old witch,
or you'll get another ducking.

300
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:52,085
Papa, Papa!
They can help us.

301
00:24:53,267 --> 00:24:54,928
Stay back.

302
00:24:54,931 --> 00:24:59,425
It's all right. They're the Brothers Grimm.
People talk about them in Malsburg.

303
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:02,181
Right you are, son.
The famous Brothers Grimm.

304
00:25:02,216 --> 00:25:04,190
Look at this strapping young lad.

305
00:25:04,225 --> 00:25:06,340
"He" is my daughter.

306
00:25:08,051 --> 00:25:10,896
And a fine wife he'll make some lucky man.

307
00:25:10,931 --> 00:25:14,992
- They kill trolls and giants, Papa.
- That's right. Of course we do, darling.

308
00:25:15,027 --> 00:25:17,131
Jake, me...

309
00:25:17,166 --> 00:25:19,235
the team.

310
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:23,887
Team Grimm at your service.

311
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:27,600
We were trying to find
and rescue the others.

312
00:25:27,635 --> 00:25:32,299
Greta was afraid. She thought there really
was a witch in the gingerbread house.

313
00:25:32,334 --> 00:25:35,080
Then birds stole our trail of crumbs.

314
00:25:35,115 --> 00:25:37,927
It was a trap.
The forest made it.

315
00:25:37,962 --> 00:25:40,740
Yes. Yes, it took my daughter too.

316
00:25:40,775 --> 00:25:42,352
- Mine too.
- And mine.

317
00:25:42,387 --> 00:25:46,381
- Ten girls are missing.
- Trees themselves set upon her.

318
00:25:46,416 --> 00:25:50,376
Up and snatched her away.
Just left her little riding cape.

319
00:25:50,411 --> 00:25:51,758
Like a wolf.

320
00:25:51,762 --> 00:25:54,663
And when my daughter ran, it took flight.

321
00:25:54,698 --> 00:25:57,409
Do you understand?
It flew!

322
00:25:57,444 --> 00:25:59,184
Flying beast.

323
00:25:59,219 --> 00:26:03,428
Rope pulley. Snap boards.
Fishing line. Wolf pelt. It's expensive.

324
00:26:03,463 --> 00:26:07,637
Our people always knew
that the forest was enchanted.

325
00:26:07,672 --> 00:26:09,519
But it's never turned against us.

326
00:26:09,554 --> 00:26:13,012
- Until now.
- Until the French occupation.

327
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:20,299
And it's all
the fault of the French!

328
00:26:26,738 --> 00:26:29,070
<i>Silenzio!</i>

329
00:26:34,899 --> 00:26:37,744
Good citizens,

330
00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:40,592
you have nothing further to fear.

331
00:26:40,627 --> 00:26:43,406
The Brothers Grimm are with you now.

332
00:26:43,441 --> 00:26:46,576
Your salvation is at hand.

333
00:26:47,698 --> 00:26:51,464
Now, we need a guide.
Someone who knows the forest.

334
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:56,795
- There is one.
- Who?

335
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:59,439
- Who?
- Who?

336
00:26:59,474 --> 00:27:02,272
- The trapper.
- The cursed one.

337
00:27:10,099 --> 00:27:11,498
Perfect.

338
00:27:16,402 --> 00:27:19,200
Excuse me, Herr Krauss?

339
00:27:20,467 --> 00:27:22,059
Um...

340
00:27:23,026 --> 00:27:26,393
Hello, there. We've come
to help find the missing children.

341
00:27:26,428 --> 00:27:29,520
We'll only need a few hours of your time.

342
00:27:30,963 --> 00:27:31,987
Oh.

343
00:27:32,018 --> 00:27:35,010
Sorry. Is your father here?

344
00:27:36,979 --> 00:27:38,970
Husband?

345
00:27:40,627 --> 00:27:43,221
Is there a man of any..?

346
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:46,841
Cursed.

347
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:54,781
Miss Krauss, perhaps you don't realize
who we are. We're the Brothers Grimm.

348
00:27:54,816 --> 00:27:58,128
We vanquished the mill witch of Karlstadt,
the frog boy of Glutenhof,

349
00:27:58,163 --> 00:28:04,068
and the cannibal chef of the Schwarzwald
in the gingerbread house of terror.

350
00:28:04,103 --> 00:28:08,190
Miss, we need a guide, someone
who knows the paths through the forest.

351
00:28:15,795 --> 00:28:17,922
We'll pay you money.

352
00:28:19,666 --> 00:28:24,399
Well, beads and... pretty shiny things
from the big city.

353
00:28:25,266 --> 00:28:26,460
Oh...

354
00:28:26,515 --> 00:28:30,952
Miss, we believe your village
may be under some kind of curse.

355
00:28:30,987 --> 00:28:32,993
Think I care about the village?

356
00:28:39,699 --> 00:28:40,961
<i>Scusi. </i>

357
00:28:40,978 --> 00:28:44,778
But he was trying to run away.

358
00:28:53,075 --> 00:28:56,408
Are you aware that ten girls in this village
have gone missing?

359
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:59,728
Two of those girls were my sisters.

360
00:28:59,763 --> 00:29:05,030
If your sisters are lucky sisters,
they are dead sisters.

361
00:29:05,065 --> 00:29:07,471
Who's your friend?

362
00:29:07,506 --> 00:29:09,167
- Um...
- I?

363
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:11,536
Who am I?

364
00:29:11,571 --> 00:29:15,667
I am Mercurio Cavaldi,
of the great Cavaldis of Parma,

365
00:29:15,702 --> 00:29:19,268
the master of the torturing arts.

366
00:29:19,303 --> 00:29:21,583
Steady, Cavaldi.

367
00:29:21,618 --> 00:29:23,984
We need her warm and breathing.

368
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:35,392
Good people of Marbaden,
your daughters will be returned.

369
00:29:35,427 --> 00:29:41,314
And you shall regain
your courage and your joy.

370
00:29:44,786 --> 00:29:47,448
To the forest!

371
00:29:47,483 --> 00:29:49,038
Hah! Hah!

372
00:29:55,858 --> 00:29:56,847
Cursed!

373
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:16,158
I don't know if I mentioned it,
but my name's Will.

374
00:30:16,193 --> 00:30:18,241
That's my brother Jake.

375
00:30:21,746 --> 00:30:24,306
I don't know if I mentioned it,
but my name's Will.

376
00:30:24,341 --> 00:30:26,064
- That's my brother...
- Angelika.

377
00:30:26,099 --> 00:30:28,463
Lovely.
Whatever trickster we're hunting -

378
00:30:28,498 --> 00:30:32,457
and by "trickster" of course I mean
"demon" - he's got to have a hideout.

379
00:30:32,492 --> 00:30:34,805
He's got to have a base of operations.

380
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,871
For example, these caves here.

381
00:30:37,906 --> 00:30:41,280
Nothing there.
Just animal bones and old drawings.

382
00:30:41,315 --> 00:30:44,654
Nine times out of ten,
there's a human perpetrator.

383
00:30:46,034 --> 00:30:48,366
Apparently we're on foot from here.

384
00:30:48,401 --> 00:30:50,603
Why?
Why we go this way?

385
00:30:50,638 --> 00:30:52,431
Why?

386
00:30:52,466 --> 00:30:56,197
Because even the animals
would never come this way.

387
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:03,028
- No weapons?
- Weapons, uh...

388
00:31:03,063 --> 00:31:05,551
We keep the weapons.

389
00:31:05,586 --> 00:31:08,919
We work with other tools, Angelika.

390
00:31:28,755 --> 00:31:30,607
Don't be afraid.

391
00:31:30,642 --> 00:31:34,237
I know this sophisticated technology
must look very strange to you.

392
00:31:34,272 --> 00:31:36,958
- What exactly is it meant to do?
- Shh!

393
00:31:46,899 --> 00:31:48,560
Right.

394
00:31:48,563 --> 00:31:50,724
I feel it's safe to proceed.

395
00:31:56,818 --> 00:31:59,616
You understand,
this really is exciting for us.

396
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:02,607
Our folk tales
sprang from places just like this.

397
00:32:02,642 --> 00:32:08,638
I mean, it's funny, everywhere you look
you can feel the forest's ancient power.

398
00:32:12,658 --> 00:32:14,285
I mean... Ough!

399
00:32:14,291 --> 00:32:17,295
I mean, to our ancestors
this place was sacred.

400
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:21,096
Till the Christians invaded.
Now it's just territory.

401
00:32:21,131 --> 00:32:23,275
Territory?

402
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:29,837
Oh. Oh!

403
00:32:29,843 --> 00:32:31,401
Heavens above!

404
00:32:31,411 --> 00:32:33,871
Will. Will, look at this.

405
00:32:33,906 --> 00:32:38,468
- So the Christian king built all this?
- In the middle of the forest?

406
00:32:38,503 --> 00:32:40,412
They cut it down.

407
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:43,298
It grew back.

408
00:32:55,442 --> 00:32:57,842
I thought you said
the animals don't come here.

409
00:32:57,877 --> 00:33:01,143
The animals don't drink from the spring.

410
00:33:01,683 --> 00:33:03,674
<i>Merde!</i>

411
00:33:04,786 --> 00:33:06,447
I mean...

412
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:08,247
<i>Scheiße. </i> Urgh!

413
00:33:08,282 --> 00:33:10,005
<i>Scheiße!</i>

414
00:33:13,522 --> 00:33:18,357
Are you feeling it, Will? I sense, so far,
dread. It's almost like a smell.

415
00:33:18,392 --> 00:33:20,353
Of death.

416
00:33:22,354 --> 00:33:24,413
Excuse me. Sorry.

417
00:33:25,298 --> 00:33:29,530
You're not afraid, are you?
Not like the villagers.

418
00:33:37,586 --> 00:33:39,315
Ah, so, um...

419
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:41,700
What happened here?

420
00:33:41,714 --> 00:33:45,081
The Christian king
destroyed the forest people.

421
00:33:45,116 --> 00:33:47,670
Burnt them to death in the caves.

422
00:33:47,705 --> 00:33:50,000
What an awful story.

423
00:33:50,035 --> 00:33:52,314
They were the lucky ones.

424
00:33:52,349 --> 00:33:54,544
A year later the plague came.

425
00:33:54,579 --> 00:33:58,071
Jake, we really should search the tower.

426
00:33:58,106 --> 00:34:00,129
There's no way in.

427
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:04,719
Never was.

428
00:34:04,754 --> 00:34:06,244
<i> Angelika. </i>

429
00:34:06,258 --> 00:34:07,350
Angelika.

430
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:11,919
Look. You see that window?
Way, way up high.

431
00:34:11,954 --> 00:34:16,550
Many centuries ago,
that's where the queen lived.

432
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:20,643
<i>She was treasured by all of Europe</i>.

433
00:34:20,678 --> 00:34:23,797
<i>Famed for her incredible beauty. </i>

434
00:34:23,832 --> 00:34:26,543
<i>But also vain and selfish. </i>

435
00:34:26,578 --> 00:34:30,255
<i>Her world was her own reflection. </i>

436
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:34,886
<i>It was on the queen's wedding day</i>
<i>that the plague arrived. </i>

437
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:40,264
<i>The king was the first to die. </i>

438
00:34:41,106 --> 00:34:43,597
<i>His bride built a tower. </i>

439
00:34:44,466 --> 00:34:48,208
<i>She locked herself away</i>.
<i>Safe from the horrors below</i>.

440
00:34:48,243 --> 00:34:53,340
<i>But what she forgot was that</i>
<i>plague is carried on the winds. </i>

441
00:34:54,642 --> 00:35:01,741
When she first fell sick and
her gorgeous flesh began to rot away,

442
00:35:01,776 --> 00:35:06,619
they say you could hear her screams
across the oceans.

443
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:11,829
My princess isn't afraid, is she?

444
00:35:12,658 --> 00:35:15,054
It's just an old story.

445
00:35:15,089 --> 00:35:17,450
Papa's here to protect you.

446
00:35:22,674 --> 00:35:25,263
<i>The Cursed Ruins. </i>

447
00:35:25,298 --> 00:35:29,291
Oh, yeah. Now, that's good. Uh-huh.
<i>The Cursed Ruins. </i>

448
00:35:30,354 --> 00:35:32,413
<i>Ruins</i>. By Ja...

449
00:35:35,986 --> 00:35:37,010
Hm.

450
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:41,633
<i>Cursed Ruins</i> by Jac...

451
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:47,503
Mm-hm. Hm.

452
00:35:52,242 --> 00:35:54,733
By Jacob Grimm.

453
00:36:00,498 --> 00:36:01,624
Will.

454
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:03,015
Will. Will!

455
00:36:25,202 --> 00:36:27,636
Argh! Ha!

456
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:35,736
Oh!

457
00:36:42,418 --> 00:36:45,819
I'll kill you and take your eggs
and smash them all in and...

458
00:36:56,018 --> 00:36:59,283
Spooky, spooky, spooky.

459
00:37:07,762 --> 00:37:11,279
I'm afraid my instruments
aren't detecting much.

460
00:37:11,314 --> 00:37:14,806
Let's call it a day before it gets,
you know, too dark.

461
00:37:14,841 --> 00:37:17,206
- We should leave.
- Angelika.

462
00:37:17,241 --> 00:37:19,983
Excuse me, uh...

463
00:37:20,018 --> 00:37:23,249
- We came from that direction.
- That's not the way.

464
00:37:23,284 --> 00:37:25,711
We walked right past those birds' trees.

465
00:37:25,746 --> 00:37:28,579
- It's this way.
- That's the way we are walking out.

466
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:32,081
Don't trust the trees.

467
00:37:36,658 --> 00:37:38,489
Hello, Grandmother Toad.

468
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:42,872
- Show us the path.
- Oh, God.

469
00:37:42,907 --> 00:37:45,854
Show us the way and I'll give you a kiss.

470
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:50,733
Oh, my, that's just not right.

471
00:37:51,762 --> 00:37:53,889
Sh, sh, sh.

472
00:37:58,482 --> 00:38:00,074
That way.

473
00:38:00,114 --> 00:38:02,844
You're sure, Grandmother?

474
00:38:02,879 --> 00:38:04,927
As I thought.

475
00:38:06,066 --> 00:38:08,296
- Yeah, right.
- You don't believe me?

476
00:38:08,331 --> 00:38:10,287
Well...

477
00:38:10,322 --> 00:38:12,449
Taste for yourself.

478
00:38:21,682 --> 00:38:24,742
- We did not come this way.
- What's her game?

479
00:38:24,777 --> 00:38:27,055
I don't think she's putting it on, Will.

480
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:29,334
There was some kind of
presence back there.

481
00:38:29,369 --> 00:38:31,231
Oh, shut up, Jacob!

482
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:34,481
Did you fall for this spooky dance number?
You mooncalf.

483
00:38:34,516 --> 00:38:35,712
Mooncalf?

484
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:40,292
She is up to something. I don't trust her.
I'd slip her the goldfish but I...

485
00:38:40,327 --> 00:38:42,305
And here we are.

486
00:38:43,442 --> 00:38:46,172
Nicely done, Angelika.
Knew you'd find it.

487
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:49,197
Hey, hey.

488
00:38:49,202 --> 00:38:51,329
Here, boy. Whoa.

489
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:54,144
Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.

490
00:38:54,179 --> 00:38:56,064
Calm down.

491
00:38:59,442 --> 00:39:00,841
Oh.

492
00:39:02,354 --> 00:39:04,879
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

493
00:39:04,882 --> 00:39:07,407
Whoa.

494
00:39:18,994 --> 00:39:24,091
Fruitful expedition. Many things
learned. Many things learned indeed.

495
00:39:24,126 --> 00:39:25,751
Won't be long now.

496
00:39:25,786 --> 00:39:27,737
Sasha.

497
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:30,831
Shall we regroup at dawn tomorrow?

498
00:39:30,866 --> 00:39:33,519
Give you boys enough time
for your beauty sleep.

499
00:39:33,554 --> 00:39:36,648
- You're on your own tomorrow.
- Sorry. What?

500
00:39:36,683 --> 00:39:38,594
I said, you're on your own tomorrow.

501
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:40,942
- What's she say?
- She said we're on our own.

502
00:39:40,977 --> 00:39:43,576
You forced me to show you the forest.

503
00:39:43,611 --> 00:39:45,665
I showed you the forest.

504
00:39:46,514 --> 00:39:49,506
It's all right.
I'll handle this one.

505
00:39:50,449 --> 00:39:52,940
Would you hitch my horse, Will?

506
00:39:55,345 --> 00:39:57,472
Are you all right?

507
00:39:58,258 --> 00:40:00,385
Can I come in?

508
00:40:03,666 --> 00:40:05,964
These drawings are very good, you know.

509
00:40:05,999 --> 00:40:08,406
I do a bit of drawing myself.

510
00:40:08,441 --> 00:40:10,463
I'm not bad.

511
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:14,927
Angelika,

512
00:40:14,962 --> 00:40:19,399
there was power in that place,
wasn't there? The tower.

513
00:40:20,114 --> 00:40:22,639
Father used to take us there.

514
00:40:22,994 --> 00:40:25,498
And where is he now?

515
00:40:25,533 --> 00:40:27,919
- He died.
- Oh.

516
00:40:27,954 --> 00:40:30,821
Last winter.
They say the wolves took him.

517
00:40:30,856 --> 00:40:32,750
The wolves?

518
00:40:32,785 --> 00:40:35,855
Look, if you won't guide us,
would you at least give us a map?

519
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:39,656
- A map wouldn't do you any good.
- A lot more good than it would do you.

520
00:40:39,691 --> 00:40:41,797
At least we can read.
Come on, Jake.

521
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:45,359
You people think you know everything.
I've been to the city.

522
00:40:45,394 --> 00:40:49,228
My father saved every penny he earned
to buy me a proper education.

523
00:40:49,263 --> 00:40:51,402
Ah, money down the drain, if you ask me.

524
00:40:51,437 --> 00:40:52,810
You're right.

525
00:40:52,818 --> 00:40:57,346
After he died, my sisters were left alone.
They were the first to be taken.

526
00:40:57,381 --> 00:40:59,862
That's why they call you cursed.

527
00:41:00,722 --> 00:41:02,713
Yeah.

528
00:41:05,234 --> 00:41:11,002
So tell me again, famous Brother Grimm,
how exactly do you intend to save us?

529
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:19,284
I think I'll do my own searching.

530
00:41:25,522 --> 00:41:28,514
I thought that went rather well.

531
00:41:30,934 --> 00:41:33,249
Gift. For surprise.

532
00:41:34,706 --> 00:41:37,174
For you. Tasty.

533
00:41:37,209 --> 00:41:39,129
Argh!

534
00:41:41,297 --> 00:41:44,239
Such German hospitality.

535
00:41:44,274 --> 00:41:48,210
The Brothers Grimm will thank you
for your kindness.

536
00:41:48,245 --> 00:41:50,082
Oh!

537
00:41:57,957 --> 00:42:00,205
I'm starving.

538
00:42:01,105 --> 00:42:06,008
No, no, no, no, no.
Not for you, my little Cinderellas.

539
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:22,658
Help me.

540
00:42:49,042 --> 00:42:51,501
There, there.

541
00:42:51,536 --> 00:42:53,903
It's all right.

542
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:56,498
What a pretty horse you are.

543
00:42:57,426 --> 00:42:59,860
Such big eyes you have.

544
00:43:00,722 --> 00:43:03,439
And big ears you have.

545
00:43:03,474 --> 00:43:07,808
And such a pretty, pretty mouth.

546
00:43:09,202 --> 00:43:10,430
Ugh!

547
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:36,220
Sorry.

548
00:43:37,873 --> 00:43:39,568
Huh? Where'd that come from?

549
00:43:45,938 --> 00:43:47,547
Ho, hey!

550
00:43:47,582 --> 00:43:49,156
Easy, easy.

551
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:51,297
Steady, easy.

552
00:43:57,265 --> 00:43:59,324
- Elsie!
- Help!

553
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:05,139
They could mechanize the horse,
put it on tracks.

554
00:44:05,174 --> 00:44:07,829
- There were no tracks.
- Get out of the way.

555
00:44:07,864 --> 00:44:10,095
Angelika.

556
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:11,757
- What about mirrors?
- Elsie!

557
00:44:11,762 --> 00:44:14,230
You use a real animal
and a warped mirror.

558
00:44:14,265 --> 00:44:16,627
That as my horse.
That was Pepper.

559
00:44:16,662 --> 00:44:20,975
What is happening?

560
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:23,501
- I should catch that horse.
- Grimmy?

561
00:44:23,536 --> 00:44:25,704
- You're wearing a bonnet.
- So are you.

562
00:44:29,938 --> 00:44:31,633
Heagh! Heagh!

563
00:44:33,842 --> 00:44:35,663
Heagh!

564
00:44:35,698 --> 00:44:37,775
Faster! Faster, Will.

565
00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:41,871
Dax, Letorc,
don't lose sight of the Grimmy.

566
00:44:41,906 --> 00:44:45,269
Go on. Kick him, kick him, Will!

567
00:44:50,385 --> 00:44:52,216
Ugh!

568
00:44:53,842 --> 00:44:56,072
Tripwires!
There's someone in the woods.

569
00:44:56,081 --> 00:44:58,049
Watch out!

570
00:45:07,986 --> 00:45:11,444
- Will, are you seeing what I'm seeing?
- I most definitely am not.

571
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:24,394
They've put the woods on wheels.

572
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:27,843
- Those trees on tracks.
- Will...

573
00:45:27,878 --> 00:45:30,419
Pulley system. Expensive.

574
00:45:32,273 --> 00:45:34,702
Control your horses.

575
00:45:34,737 --> 00:45:38,673
Don't lose sight of the Grimmy.
Go, go. <i>Idioti!</i>

576
00:45:39,122 --> 00:45:42,114
I've been looking for you.

577
00:45:51,217 --> 00:45:53,722
Stralda, what's happening?

578
00:45:53,757 --> 00:45:56,228
<i>Avanti. Avanti. Avanti!</i>

579
00:45:56,263 --> 00:45:57,198
Gie, gie, gie!

580
00:46:09,778 --> 00:46:11,939
You can see they're on tracks.

581
00:46:14,065 --> 00:46:16,795
- Show yourselves!
- There, there, there!

582
00:46:17,425 --> 00:46:19,552
Can you hear me?

583
00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:25,582
What is this, Grimms?
What is happening?

584
00:46:25,617 --> 00:46:28,450
These people are
much better funded than we are.

585
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:33,878
Get down! Get down.

586
00:46:46,610 --> 00:46:47,736
Wait!

587
00:46:50,289 --> 00:46:52,553
Stop, Will.

588
00:46:56,177 --> 00:46:58,377
Help me!

589
00:46:58,412 --> 00:47:00,527
Help!

590
00:47:00,562 --> 00:47:04,225
<i>Aschenputtel!</i>

591
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:13,440
Run! Run!

592
00:48:06,417 --> 00:48:08,510
His eyes.

593
00:48:12,145 --> 00:48:14,204
His eyes.

594
00:48:16,465 --> 00:48:18,592
My hair.

595
00:48:26,577 --> 00:48:28,395
Letorc?

596
00:48:28,430 --> 00:48:30,214
Dax?

597
00:48:30,225 --> 00:48:35,629
Can you hear my voice?
I command you, fall in.

598
00:48:38,065 --> 00:48:41,057
How many times do I have to tell you?

599
00:48:56,145 --> 00:48:58,734
There you go. Can't breathe.

600
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:01,870
This is so incredible.

601
00:49:01,905 --> 00:49:05,231
This changes everything.
Gotta write this down. That was real.

602
00:49:05,266 --> 00:49:10,033
Beans, Jake. Magic beans. There is
a rational explanation for all of this.

603
00:49:10,068 --> 00:49:12,897
What do you mean?
Rational explanation? The bugs were...

604
00:49:12,932 --> 00:49:14,872
And the forest was sweeping down on us.

605
00:49:14,897 --> 00:49:16,330
Stop it, Jake!

606
00:49:16,337 --> 00:49:18,805
- It was like everything was under a spell.
- Or curse.

607
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:22,135
- What?
- My whole family's cursed.

608
00:49:22,961 --> 00:49:25,759
My father...
Father...

609
00:49:26,705 --> 00:49:29,265
- What about your father?
- I have to go back.

610
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,565
Angelika...

611
00:49:32,402 --> 00:49:35,394
On the ground.
On the ground, <i>crucchi bastardi!</i>

612
00:49:35,429 --> 00:49:39,621
Go down, now!
On the ground.

613
00:49:39,656 --> 00:49:43,814
Now, who killed my men, huh?

614
00:49:43,849 --> 00:49:45,997
You tell me, Grimmy.

615
00:49:46,032 --> 00:49:48,110
Who? Or she will die.

616
00:49:48,145 --> 00:49:50,613
It was the forest.

617
00:49:50,648 --> 00:49:53,009
German peasant.

618
00:49:53,585 --> 00:49:56,645
And if you stay it will destroy you too.

619
00:49:58,641 --> 00:50:00,462
<i>Mesdames et messieurs</i>.

620
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:04,831
The emperor honors me with a visit
from you, his most trusted advisors.

621
00:50:08,433 --> 00:50:10,190
I salute you.

622
00:50:10,225 --> 00:50:15,128
Your shining examples illuminate
this dark German forest of ignorance and...

623
00:50:15,163 --> 00:50:17,721
<i> Dov'è il generale?</i>

624
00:50:19,153 --> 00:50:21,519
Ah! <i>Il generale!</i>

625
00:50:21,554 --> 00:50:22,979
Finally, finally!

626
00:50:25,329 --> 00:50:26,489
General... Ah!

627
00:50:26,514 --> 00:50:28,982
<i>Guten Tag. Buongiorno. </i>

628
00:50:29,017 --> 00:50:30,702
<i>Bonjour. </i>

629
00:50:30,737 --> 00:50:33,331
<i>Bonjour. </i>

630
00:50:34,289 --> 00:50:38,589
General, your soldiers...

631
00:50:38,624 --> 00:50:39,641
<i>finito. </i>

632
00:50:39,665 --> 00:50:41,678
They are dead.

633
00:50:41,713 --> 00:50:44,270
I'm lucky survived. See?

634
00:50:44,305 --> 00:50:47,797
Here, just this little wound.

635
00:50:47,832 --> 00:50:51,322
Just a little, little itchy scratch.

636
00:51:08,529 --> 00:51:11,396
We begin with lobster bisque.

637
00:51:11,431 --> 00:51:12,369
Ah!

638
00:51:12,401 --> 00:51:14,274
You embarrass me.

639
00:51:14,309 --> 00:51:16,110
You ridicule me!

640
00:51:16,145 --> 00:51:19,308
You insult me in front of my guests.

641
00:51:19,343 --> 00:51:21,909
These people are Parisians.

642
00:51:21,944 --> 00:51:23,822
No, no! Argh!

643
00:51:23,857 --> 00:51:26,670
They tried to blind Cavaldi

644
00:51:26,705 --> 00:51:31,039
with their fairy tales
and devouring trees and flying wolves.

645
00:51:31,074 --> 00:51:33,873
But I use my logical brain, Generale.

646
00:51:33,908 --> 00:51:36,672
I can make this as clear as crystal.

647
00:51:36,707 --> 00:51:39,999
I am in no way responsible.

648
00:51:40,034 --> 00:51:43,291
It is them.
They are the ones.

649
00:51:43,326 --> 00:51:45,447
The Grimmy!

650
00:51:47,601 --> 00:51:50,607
The plan is very simple.

651
00:51:50,642 --> 00:51:53,454
They use the little girls as bait,

652
00:51:53,489 --> 00:51:57,425
they lure your soldiers
into the forest, and, uh...

653
00:51:58,289 --> 00:52:00,223
- Bingo.
- Bingo?

654
00:52:00,258 --> 00:52:02,401
Yes. Shh.

655
00:52:02,436 --> 00:52:04,494
It's bingo.

656
00:52:04,529 --> 00:52:08,348
General, we are outmaneuvered,
outflanked, outnumbered

657
00:52:08,383 --> 00:52:12,167
by some German force
which threatens your superiorit...

658
00:52:13,585 --> 00:52:14,847
Grimms.

659
00:52:14,865 --> 00:52:18,318
What precisely happened in the forest?

660
00:52:18,353 --> 00:52:22,619
General, I believe we witnessed
a case of authenticated enchantment.

661
00:52:22,654 --> 00:52:25,639
We're not saying that.
That is not our official position.

662
00:52:25,674 --> 00:52:27,676
But it's true.

663
00:52:28,593 --> 00:52:30,220
Kill them.

664
00:52:30,225 --> 00:52:32,420
I will deal with you later.

665
00:52:32,455 --> 00:52:34,528
No, monsieur.

666
00:52:36,241 --> 00:52:38,190
Don't kill.

667
00:52:38,225 --> 00:52:42,355
I can make them speak.

668
00:52:44,433 --> 00:52:46,060
<i>Musica. </i>

669
00:52:49,609 --> 00:52:50,749
Huh?

670
00:52:55,249 --> 00:52:57,308
Wait! No! Stop!

671
00:52:57,329 --> 00:52:59,422
No, no, no, no, no!

672
00:53:03,089 --> 00:53:06,126
This is nothing to do with me.
He forced...

673
00:53:06,161 --> 00:53:09,006
- She's innocent. Let her go.
- Stop!

674
00:53:09,041 --> 00:53:13,910
General, you keep working with Cavaldi,
this country won't be yours much longer.

675
00:53:13,945 --> 00:53:19,215
- He panics.
- The great Cavaldi never panics.

676
00:53:23,729 --> 00:53:25,720
Uh...

677
00:53:29,457 --> 00:53:31,246
Hm.

678
00:53:31,281 --> 00:53:33,044
<i>À point. </i>

679
00:53:33,681 --> 00:53:36,241
<i>Bon appétit. Mes chiens. </i>

680
00:53:38,193 --> 00:53:40,218
- Stop!
- General!

681
00:53:40,253 --> 00:53:42,302
Cavaldi was right.

682
00:53:42,449 --> 00:53:44,576
Cavaldi was right.

683
00:53:44,913 --> 00:53:46,710
We saw them. We did.

684
00:53:46,993 --> 00:53:49,757
There was three in the trees,
two in the caves.

685
00:53:49,792 --> 00:53:51,470
Huge men. With weapons.

686
00:53:51,505 --> 00:53:55,532
My masterpiece is working.
Truth comes out.

687
00:53:55,985 --> 00:54:00,684
These are backward people. They cling to
folklore because it gives them strength.

688
00:54:00,719 --> 00:54:02,830
Stop. You're giving them what they want.

689
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:05,518
The longer this goes on,
the more Germans will talk like her.

690
00:54:05,553 --> 00:54:09,922
- Then arm themselves, organize...
- Then the problem won't be just a forest.

691
00:54:09,957 --> 00:54:11,627
- It shall be a nation!
- Yes!

692
00:54:11,662 --> 00:54:13,262
- Let us do it our way.
- Yes!

693
00:54:13,297 --> 00:54:16,266
- Send us back into the forest.
- Ye... What?

694
00:54:17,233 --> 00:54:19,463
We'll lie in wait
with our men, our equipment.

695
00:54:19,498 --> 00:54:21,775
- No, no...
- General, trust me.

696
00:54:21,810 --> 00:54:24,053
Let us rig a surprise for them.

697
00:54:30,737 --> 00:54:32,728
Cavaldi, stop.

698
00:54:33,713 --> 00:54:35,806
- Huh?
- Stop!

699
00:54:54,289 --> 00:54:56,658
Very well, Grimms.

700
00:54:56,693 --> 00:54:59,873
You shall return to the forest.

701
00:54:59,908 --> 00:55:03,054
But I warn you,
attempt to escape

702
00:55:03,089 --> 00:55:05,997
and I shall raze every tree,

703
00:55:06,032 --> 00:55:08,846
demolish every building,

704
00:55:08,881 --> 00:55:12,749
slaughter every innocent in search of you.

705
00:55:13,585 --> 00:55:15,075
You understand?

706
00:55:18,545 --> 00:55:19,739
<i>Bon. </i>

707
00:55:50,449 --> 00:55:52,576
Mind his head.

708
00:55:56,433 --> 00:55:59,698
Pack the horses with as much gear
as they can carry, all right?

709
00:55:59,733 --> 00:56:03,626
I'm a little unclear
as to who exactly we're up against.

710
00:56:03,661 --> 00:56:06,938
Just stay close to your horse.

711
00:56:12,272 --> 00:56:14,350
Jake. Jake.

712
00:56:14,385 --> 00:56:15,409
- Listen.
- What?

713
00:56:15,473 --> 00:56:17,774
Go and get back on your horse.

714
00:56:17,809 --> 00:56:21,176
- We're gonna make a run for it.
- I remember the rest of the story.

715
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:22,766
What are you talking about?

716
00:56:22,769 --> 00:56:25,294
- It's an ancient folklore, passed down...
- Jake!

717
00:56:25,329 --> 00:56:28,564
The tower, the queen, her story, it's...

718
00:56:28,599 --> 00:56:30,254
- Before the plague...
- Jacob.

719
00:56:30,289 --> 00:56:35,158
...the queen killed all the villagers'
ancestors to get her hands on their spells.

720
00:56:35,193 --> 00:56:39,428
- And one was a spell for eternal life.
- Give me that stupid book!

721
00:56:39,463 --> 00:56:42,212
- She's still in the tower. She's there now.
- Jake.
