Pretty awesome game

52
00:03:52,706 --> 00:03:54,207
I used to play It when I was a kId

53
00:03:54,628 --> 00:03:56,769
What It Is, Is...
they gIve you a spInner

00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,411
and you spIn.
If you land on a ladder

55
00:03:59,432 --> 00:04:02,134
You get to clImb up the ladder.
If you land on a chute

56
00:04:02,135 --> 00:04:03,911
you got to slIde down the chute
and start all over agaIn

57
00:04:03,912 --> 00:04:07,517

00:04:11,881 --> 00:04:13,372
Me and my buddIes

61
00:04:13,373 --> 00:04:16,644
We'd go down to the basement

62
00:04:16,645 --> 00:04:18,755

00:04:18,807 --> 00:04:20,148

81
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:01,040
Just go walk down the hallway!

00:14:14,644 --> 00:14:15,844
through a lIttle bIrd

267
00:14:15,845 --> 00:14:20,648
that you guys rented the Earnshaw
lakehouse for us for the entIre weekend

268
00:14:20,649 --> 00:14:22,222
That's lIke a dream come true for us

269
00:14:22,223 --> 00:14:24,155
We had to rent It for the whole weekend

270
00:14:24,156 --> 00:14:26,412
but we don't get to stay the whole weekend

271
00:14:26,413 --> 00:14:29,615
because we have to go to MIlan tomorrow
for Roxanne's fashIon show

00:14:53,696 --> 00:14:56,815
Well I don't understand why you
had to rent It for the whole weekend

281
00:14:56,816 --> 00:14:58,610
You pay for the whole weekend
because It's a holIday

282
00:14:58,611 --> 00:15:00,680
and they won't
rent It to you for one nIght

283
00:15:00,681 --> 00:15:04,763
So your frIends are partyIng all weekend

00:15:04,764 --> 00:15:05,345

00:15:31,105 --> 00:15:32,766

descrIbe hIs devotIon to hIs fellow man

301
00:16:04,252 --> 00:16:07,274
he truly took care

302
00:16:07,694 --> 00:16:09,756
When Robert knew that hIs tIme was short

303
00:16:10,016 --> 00:16:14,319
He told me there was one specIfIc man he
wanted to say a few words to memorIalIze hIm

304
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,602
So I'd lIke to ask Lenny Feder
to come up now

305
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,469
I'm sorry

306
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:28,920
I'm not prepared at all
I ... I'm

307
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,373
I feel very honoured
that ... that

308
00:16:32,754 --> 00:16:34,656
Coach asked me to do thIs but uh ...

309
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:40,100
I also feel terrIble, because
I haven't seen the coach In so long

310
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,863
And um... he always wanted me to
come Into town and see hIm and uh ...

311
00:16:44,684 --> 00:16:47,066
I got caught up In
what I've been doIng and

312
00:16:47,326 --> 00:16:48,667
I regret It

313
00:16:49,248 --> 00:16:53,590
I understand that the St. Mark's team
of 1978 was the only champIonshIp

314
00:16:53,591 --> 00:16:55,713
team that the coach ever had

315
00:16:55,733 --> 00:16:59,395
and uh ...
That's very ImpressIve

316
00:16:59,896 --> 00:17:03,300
I've got to say, judgIng from
the talent we had to offer

317
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,980
I mean, belIeve It or not

318
00:17:05,981 --> 00:17:09,724
RobbIe and Marcus were
actually shorter In back 1979

319
00:17:09,725 --> 00:17:12,769
Yeah but those guys had a skIll
that you never masterd

320
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:16,148
They knew how to pass the ball

321
00:17:16,149 --> 00:17:19,759
Looks lIke somebody has to learn
how to pass the Kentucky FrIed ChIcken

322
00:17:21,754 --> 00:17:24,435
I'm kIddIng
I'm kIddIng

323
00:17:24,436 --> 00:17:25,699
We're sayIng goodbye to
a bIg part of our lIves

324
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,998

You affected everybody In hIs room
and um ...

326
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:34,662
I hope we get to lIve our lIves lIke you

327
00:17:36,405 --> 00:17:41,189
Have no regrets
when lIfe's fInal buzzer sounds

328
00:17:43,451 --> 00:17:45,913

00:19:00,953 --> 00:19:03,255
Don't get so mad there RobbIe

341
00:19:05,757 --> 00:19:08,812
So how are we feelIng about Rob's gIrl?
Are we happy for hIm?

342
00:19:08,813 --> 00:19:10,400
Oh my god, the SaInt Polly Grandma?

343
00:19:10,401 --> 00:19:12,822
She seems all rIght
- She's pretty

344
00:19:12,963 --> 00:19:17,106
You know. In a "me In a wIg"
sort of way

345
00:19:18,807 --> 00:19:22,470
When uh... Ben FranklIn was
flyIng that kIte, It had the key on It

346
00:19:22,471 --> 00:19:26,813
That was to her apartment

347
00:19:26,814 --> 00:19:28,555
You know what?
I've gotta say

348
00:19:28,575 --> 00:19:30,416
he seems lIke he's In love you know

349
00:19:30,417 --> 00:19:32,810
Well he was In love
wIth the fIrst three wIves too

350
00:19:32,811 --> 00:19:34,004
The cheater, the beater
and the eater

351
00:19:34,005 --> 00:19:35,460
Yeah

352
00:19:35,461 --> 00:19:38,742
You know, hIs problem Is he's
always so overly In love so quIck

353
00:19:38,743 --> 00:19:41,803
and then one day he snaps
and then It get's ugly In a hurry

354
00:19:41,804 --> 00:19:43,626
Coffee Mr. Feder?

Uh... No, no, no, no
I'm good, I'm good

00:19:45,629 --> 00:19:47,069
I mean I thank you

00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,151

What's the bIg box

Um... that's the rest of the TV

435
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:09,064
They dIdn't always have
flatscreens there sport

Wow! That Is some
stone-age shIznIt

Yeah that's whack

441
00:24:28,495 --> 00:24:31,470
Yeah but he says maze
because It sounds more mystIcal

Exactly
- Well I lIke the way he saId It

It's fantastIc okay

446

Wrong choIce

462
00:25:32,367 --> 00:25:35,428
ImagIne when a burgler comes over

463
00:25:35,429 --> 00:25:36,849

Wow, what's that turkey doIng In the house?

00:26:06,123 --> 00:26:08,600

00:26:08,601 --> 00:26:09,796
or do somethIng In the woods

00:26:09,797 --> 00:26:12,638
There wasn't a tIme of

We weren't, we were always out...

# If you lIke pIna coladas #

00:46:22,577 --> 00:46:25,459
Can you have sex when they're pregnant?
or does that hurt the baby

913
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:27,917
No, McKenzIe can because the baby

936
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:31,200
Remember the rules, whoever stays

1484
01:17:37,441 --> 01:17:39,865
You're a dead man!

1485
01:17:39,866 --> 01:17:42,865

1488
01:17:49,866 --> 01:17:52,046

1493
01:18:02,225 --> 01:18:03,805

1494
01:18:04,365 --> 01:18:06,464
(kIck landIng)

Come on!
Why are you fIghtIng?

1497
01:18:12,001 --> 01:18:13,703
Good to see mIdget wrestlIng agaIn though
I got to say

1498
01:18:13,704 --> 01:18:16,446
How could you do that?
That's my daughter!

1499
01:18:16,447 --> 01:18:19,044
- Do what?!
- Shake the bed wIth her!

1500
01:18:19,045 --> 01:18:20,964
You thInk I would do that to you?!

1501
01:18:20,965 --> 01:18:23,703
Out of any of us? yeah...
You'd be the one to do that

1502
01:18:23,704 --> 01:18:25,782
I mean you dId sleep wIth StImpson's Mother

1503
01:18:25,783 --> 01:18:27,622
I dIdn't even know that guy!

1504
01:18:27,623 --> 01:18:29,430
It was your frIend!
I barely knew hIm!

1505
01:18:29,431 --> 01:18:32,040
She grabbed my wIener...
I told you guys!

1506
01:18:32,041 --> 01:18:33,761
That's hIs daughter, It's dIfferent!

1507
01:18:33,762 --> 01:18:37,141
Me and hIm?
Okay, maybe I flIrted wIth hIm

1508
01:18:37,142 --> 01:18:40,016
but that was just to get your attentIon

1509
01:18:40,017 --> 01:18:41,556
- Well what about hIs snorIng?
- I heard It too

1510
01:18:41,557 --> 01:18:43,568
(ImItates buzzer)

1511
01:18:43,569 --> 01:18:44,821
(kIck landIng)
- Ahh!!

1512
01:18:44,822 --> 01:18:48,021
Oh no!...twIce?

1513
01:18:48,022 --> 01:18:49,620
We heard It from three rooms away

1514
01:18:49,621 --> 01:18:52,455
All rIght then, he's off the hook
You know Marcus wouldn't

1515
01:18:52,456 --> 01:18:56,161
be wIth your daughter. I..I mean not that she's...
You know what I'm sayIng

1516
01:18:56,781 --> 01:18:58,505
Well what happened to your head?

1517
01:18:58,506 --> 01:19:00,500
When I was changIng Into my pj's

1518
01:19:00,501 --> 01:19:04,176
I got the feelIng that some
perv was lookIng through my wIndow

1519
01:19:04,177 --> 01:19:08,299
So I went to go close the shade and
I trIpped and hIt my head

1520
01:19:08,300 --> 01:19:13,720
Yeah dude...that's your daughter.
I'd never be wIth her, you're my best frIend man

1521
01:19:14,539 --> 01:19:17,338
And JasmIne would never be
wIth me because I'm me

1522
01:19:17,339 --> 01:19:19,373
Sorry I don't have my whole
lIfe together lIke Lenny

1523
01:19:19,374 --> 01:19:23,258
Oh, together lIke Lenny...please

1524
01:19:23,259 --> 01:19:27,147
I answered your phone you pIchacorta
It was your assIstant

1525
01:19:27,148 --> 01:19:30,252
I asked hIm If he cancelled the 
flIght to MIlan and he saId he dId...

1526
01:19:30,253 --> 01:19:31,852
Before we even came here!

1527
01:19:31,853 --> 01:19:34,907
He saId that?
Why would he say that?

1528
01:19:34,908 --> 01:19:37,062
- I mean...
- So he just made that up huh?

1529
01:19:37,063 --> 01:19:41,667
I'm not sayIng he made It up... I thInk
In hIs head he belIeves It's true

1530
01:19:41,668 --> 01:19:46,190
Don't you agent me Lenny!
Stop tryIng to handle everybody and everythIng

1531
01:19:46,191 --> 01:19:49,115
and start takIng a lIttle 
responsIbIlIty for once!

1532
01:19:49,116 --> 01:19:50,456
I'll take responsIbIlIty

1533
01:19:50,457 --> 01:19:54,175
Okay, you're rIght
I thought It would be better for our famIly

1534
01:19:54,176 --> 01:19:56,470
to be here wIth normal people
Instead of goIng to MIlan

1535
01:19:56,471 --> 01:19:58,666
We're normal?

1536
01:19:58,667 --> 01:20:02,335
I was scared to tell you
It was easIer for me to keep It a secret

1537
01:20:02,336 --> 01:20:05,600
You peel back any marrIage there are secrets

1538
01:20:05,601 --> 01:20:07,374
MIne Is...I...I love you

1539
01:20:07,375 --> 01:20:08,029
I love you very much

1540
01:20:08,030 --> 01:20:13,835
Roxanne, I just...I...our kIds are 
becomIng nutty, snotty, spoIled

1541
01:20:14,495 --> 01:20:18,173
I...I...we got a Nanny, we got...
- So she Is a Nanny

1542
01:20:18,174 --> 01:20:21,704
- No, no, no. she's not a Nanny
- Of course she's a Nanny!

1543
01:20:21,705 --> 01:20:22,813
When does the lyIng stop?

1544
01:20:22,814 --> 01:20:25,202
It stops rIght after thIs

1545
01:20:25,203 --> 01:20:27,530
She's more of an au paIr okay?
not really a Nanny

1546
01:20:27,531 --> 01:20:28,893
- Lenny
- (laughIng)

1547
01:20:28,894 --> 01:20:35,237
All rIght that's It, the lyIng stops now
I won't lIe to you ever agaIn, I swear to God

1548
01:20:35,238 --> 01:20:36,932
I love you

1549
01:20:36,933 --> 01:20:40,003
Men lIe!
They can't help themselves

1550
01:20:40,004 --> 01:20:42,852
Kurt sure as hell lIes!

1551
01:20:42,853 --> 01:20:45,675
What do I lIe about
"Toe" J. SImpson

1552
01:20:45,676 --> 01:20:49,446
Oh please...the Nanny?
- What about the Nanny?

1553
01:20:49,447 --> 01:20:53,696
- You have a thIng for her!
- I do not have a thIng for the Nanny

1554
01:20:53,697 --> 01:20:55,937
I'm a marrIed man...perIod

1555
01:20:55,938 --> 01:20:59,085
But dId I enjoy havIng a nIce conversatIon

1556
01:20:59,086 --> 01:21:02,911
wIth a woman that wasn't goIng
"where's thIs?" and "dId you pIck up that"

1557
01:21:03,571 --> 01:21:06,341
- Yeah
- Well you could have nIce conversatIons wIth me

1558
01:21:06,371 --> 01:21:08,009
When? 
You're always workIng

1559
01:21:08,010 --> 01:21:11,640
and when you come home
your just...you're tIred all the tIme

1560
01:21:11,641 --> 01:21:13,766
You barely even touch me
or look at me

1561
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:15,729
- He sounds lIke an old woman!

1562
01:21:15,730 --> 01:21:20,208
Deanne, you should have marrIed
Umberto DenuzzIo lIke I told you

1563
01:21:20,209 --> 01:21:23,115
- Yeah and you know If 
I'd have stayed wIth hIm

1564
01:21:23,116 --> 01:21:26,328

pregnant rIght now Momma!

1565
01:21:26,329 --> 01:21:29,827
You're probably rIght sweetheart
I'll just butt out

1566
01:21:29,828 --> 01:21:30,909
Thank you!

1567
01:21:31,569 --> 01:21:34,000
Look maybe I do take you for granted

1568
01:21:34,001 --> 01:21:34,999
and I'm sorry

1569
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:38,417
How's about I take you out 
every Thursday nIght for date nIght?

1570
01:21:38,418 --> 01:21:42,628
No, Thursday's Grey's Anatomy but...
any other nIght would be beautIful

1571
01:21:44,848 --> 01:21:46,867
As long as we're all beIng honest

1572
01:21:46,887 --> 01:21:48,947
I thInk I should be honest too

1573
01:21:48,948 --> 01:21:49,766
Um...

1574
01:21:49,767 --> 01:21:54,966
I'm actually not a part owner 
of the lawn furnIture store

1575
01:21:54,967 --> 01:22:00,346
I don't even work there anymore
I got laId off In AprIl

1576
01:22:00,886 --> 01:22:05,240
But I rented a Caddy and

1577
01:22:05,241 --> 01:22:07,085
because I dIdn't want you guys to know

1578
01:22:07,086 --> 01:22:09,985
Lamonsoff, you don't have to
hIde anythIng from us

1579
01:22:09,986 --> 01:22:10,884
I'm sorry

Yeah, sInce we're gettIng 
thIngs off our chest here

1581
01:22:14,254 --> 01:22:19,004

1584
01:22:23,444 --> 01:22:24,999
(laughter)

1585
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,380
- I have a confessIon to make

1586
01:22:27,750 --> 01:22:29,323
I'm really...a man

1587
01:22:29,324 --> 01:22:34,442
- No
- I saId that

1588
01:22:34,443 --> 01:22:37,385
- I'm just kIddIng, I'm just kIddIng

1589
01:22:37,386 --> 01:22:39,875
I'm really a lIttle hurt that
so many of you belIeved It

1590
01:22:39,876 --> 01:22:42,362
- No, no, no we were just sayIng...
- SerIously, you're very womanly

1591
01:22:42,363 --> 01:22:45,802
Nevertheless, I know It's not my place

1592
01:22:45,803 --> 01:22:49,753
but uh... well after all,
I am older than anyone here

1593
01:22:49,754 --> 01:22:51,782
- Hell yeah you are!

1594
01:22:53,402 --> 01:22:57,222
Well despIte the jokIng and the razzIng
I see a lot of love here

1595

And wIth love, comes hostIlIty

1596
01:23:00,601 --> 01:23:05,760
LIke uh...Rob, when he snapped at me 
the other day. That was scary

1597
01:23:05,761 --> 01:23:08,480
And you all thought that I was so calm

1598
01:23:08,481 --> 01:23:14,540
But InsIde...InsIde I was sayIng 
GlorIa Noonan, do not call hIm

1601
01:23:22,061 --> 01:23:23,499
- I lIke that

1602
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:27,193
Or that he resembles 
an elder...gay...Jonas brother

1603
01:23:27,194 --> 01:23:29,960
They get It...
they get the poInt about where you're goIng

1604
01:23:29,961 --> 01:23:32,499
Or a mIdget PhIllIpIno FonzIe

1605
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:33,638
I dIdn't say any of those thIngs

1606
01:23:33,639 --> 01:23:35,659
That's my favorIte one

But that's what makes It InterestIng

1611
01:23:49,517 --> 01:23:52,681
In lIfe, the fIrst act...alway's excItIng

1612
01:23:52,682 --> 01:23:56,737
The second act...
that's where the depth comes In

1613
01:23:58,517 --> 01:24:02,666
- Why dIdn't you ever tell us that she gets It?
- Yeah you were really holdIng out

1614
01:24:02,667 --> 01:24:05,189
