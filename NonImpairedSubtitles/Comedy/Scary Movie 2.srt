1
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,400
One of your old favorite
songs from way back when

2
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,960
So...

3
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,240
Take her wrap, fellas

4
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,800
Find her an empty lap,
fellas

5
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,600
Dolly'll never go away

6
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,040
Dolly'll never go away
again

7
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,280
Hey, do you guys
know this one?

8
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,480
Oh!

9
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,320
Now this is the real shit.

10
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,800
Uh-huh.

11
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,280
Shake your ass,
watch yourself

12
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,760
Shake your ass

13
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,200
Show me what
you're working with

14
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,160
Attention all
young players and pimps

15
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,320
Right now
is the place to be

16
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,080
I thought I told
y'all niggers before

17
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,040
Y'all niggers
don't fuck with me

18
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,600
Shake your ass

19
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,720
Watch yourself

20
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,080
Shake your ass

21
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,240
Show me what
you're working with

22
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,440
Shake your ass

23
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,520
You suck.

24
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,720
- Uh!
- Uh!

25
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,200
Oh!

26
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,120
Who put the horse out?

27
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,920
She's good.

28
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,480
She--she's been really sick.

29
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,800
Bad, bad, bad girl!

30
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,080
OK. That'll be $17.50.

31
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,160
Hey, buddy!
Hey, pay the fare.

32
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,160
I'm Father McFeely.

33
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,520
I'm so glad you're here.

34
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,560
I came as fast as I could,
but at my age...

35
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,560
the little soldier needs
a lot more thumping...

36
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,520
before it starts pumping,
if you know what I mean.

37
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,200
I do find, though,
if I tickle my asshole...

38
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,520
just before I unleash
the dog of war--

39
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,800
It's OK. I understand.

40
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,720
You know,
because in the old days...

41
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,200
you know when you--

42
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,560
How is she?

43
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,840
It's gotten worse, Father.

44
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,240
Really?

45
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,120
She won't eat,
she won't talk.

46
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,965
The child won't even
let me touch her.

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,480
Yes. Sometimes you have
to give them candy.

48
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,680
Father...

49
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,120
the church sent me
to assist you.

50
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,120
I'm Father Harris.

51
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,080
- Hi.
- Hi. Nice to see you.

52
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,440
Would you like
to see the girl?

53
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,680
Soon...

54
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,120
but first
I must bless this house.

55
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,360
"The sorrows of death
compassed me...

56
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,640
"and the pains of Hell
got hold upon me.

57
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,800
"I found... "

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,720
"Then called I upon
the name of the Lord and... "

59
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,680
"My soul from death. "

60
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,120
Oh, God. Please, Lord.

61
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,480
Help me to release
this demon.

62
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,720
Ahh!

63
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,400
Thank you, Lord,
the most merciful Almighty.

64
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,640
Oh, hold on.

65
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,400
Ahh!
Ah, those enchiladas.

66
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,280
Ha, ha, ha!

67
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,080
Thank you, Lord.

68
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,960
Aah!

69
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,520
Fuck this.

70
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,880
Father!

71
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,680
Fuck! Did you see this?
Look at this!

72
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,320
Please, Father,
think of the child.

73
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,320
Fuck!

74
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,640
Yes.

75
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,240
It's freezing.

76
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,120
Let us pray.

77
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,520
"Defender of the human race...

78
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,240
"look down in pity upon this,
your servant. "

79
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,560
Shove it up your ass,
you worthless piece of shit.

80
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,160
Aah!

81
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,880
Silence!

82
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,880
Mmm.

83
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,200
"Holy Lord--"

84
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,920
Your mother is in here
with us, Harris.

85
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,880
Would you like
to leave a message?

86
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,560
I'll be sure that she gets it.

87
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,360
Yes. Mom, will you
get out of there, please?

88
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,440
You're no fun.

89
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,880
I'm working.

90
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,920
See you later,
Mrs. Harris.

91
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,400
"Holy Lord,
Almighty Father in--"

92
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,400
Aah!

93
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,360
"Everlasting God...

94
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,440
"and Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ...

95
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,720
"and the Virgin Mary's
baby daddy.

96
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,640
"Holy Lord,

97
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,200
"everlasting God...

00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,040
"who once consigned
that fallen tyrant...

"kicked off of "Survivor--"

104
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,240
Fuck me! Fuck me!

105
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,560
Father!

106
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,560
Huh?

107
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,480
This is not
part of the ritual.

108
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:14,400
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy--

109
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,360
Ha, ha, ha!

110
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,440
Ha, ha, ha!

111
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,520
Ha, ha, ha!

112
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,280
Oh!

113
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,400
Here you go, Father.
All clean.

114
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,880
Oh, thank you so much.

115
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,800
OK.

116
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,760
Hee, hee, hee!

117
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,720
You failed, McFeely.

118
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,200
Your weapons are useless
against me.

119
00:06:48,235 --> 00:06:49,960
Let us pray.

120
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,760
BOTH?
Our Father who Art in Heaven--

121
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,920
Ha ha!

122
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,365
Stop it!

123
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,840
Hallowed be Thy name.

124
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:57,920
Ha ha!

125
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,000
Zip it.

126
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,200
Thy kingdom come.

127
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,160
Your mother sucks cocks in Hell.

128
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,160
Ha! Shit!

129
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,080
Suck on this.

130
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,280
Uh-oh!

131
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,120
I let you go

132
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,160
Let you go
like a dozen balloons

133
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,480
Without even thinking

134
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,520
I didn't know,
now I know

135
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,600
It was much too soon

136
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:37,640
Why can't you call
and say you miss me?

137
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,640
So you think you made it
into the class, Shorty?

138
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,960
I sure hope so, Cindy.

139
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,820
You could use the grade, huh?

140
00:07:42,855 --> 00:07:44,640
Nah. I need a place to stay.

141
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,280
Mom Dukes kicked me out,
but you know something?

142
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,680
I learned something
very important in college--

143
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,960
the value of books.

144
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,960
Really?

145
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,080
Yeah. Look at this here.

146
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,960
Free paper. Ha ha!
Shit, son.

147
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,160
Yeah, so how
you digging college?

148
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,360
I don't know.

149
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,760
It's OK, I guess.

150
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,040
I feel like such a geek
sometimes, though.

151
00:08:07,075 --> 00:08:09,520
Everyone is so cool,
and I'm... not.

152
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,560
Oh, come on, Cindy.

153
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,960
You ain't that bad.

154
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,880
All you need is
a little bit of flavor.

155
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,400
Hmm. Maybe some new gear.

156
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,600
"Gear?"

157
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,880
That's slang for "clothing. "

158
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,800
- Oh.
- Here. Come on.

159
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,160
We gonna cool you up
right now.

160
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,640
Don't sit like this,
first of all.

161
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,640
Don't sit like that, son.
Sit cool.

162
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,480
- OK.
- Right up, son.

163
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,480
Feel yourself, son,
like that.

164
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,760
Yeah. Now go like this.

165
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,920
Uh. Uh, yeah.

166
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,840
- That's cool.
- Yeah.

167
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,440
Yeah. Now stand up,
let me show you some moves.

168
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,720
Right, left.

169
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,800
Uh, son. Uh!

170
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,040
Right, left.

171
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,200
Right, kick.

172
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,200
Uh, son.

173
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,400
Uh, psych.

174
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,440
Throw a little bit
of slang in there.

175
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,120
Say, "Yo, that jacket
is tight, son. Ya mean?"

176
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,800
Yo, that jacket is tight, son.

177
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,480
- Ya mean?
- Ya mean?

178
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,400
Yeah, something like that.

179
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,360
Throw it all together.

180
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,920
OK. Right, left.

181
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,560
Right, kick, uh!

182
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,640
Yo, that jacket is tight.

183
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,640
Now run that shit, bitch.
Ya mean?

184
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,560
That is the shit, dog.

185
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,520
Oh, man.
You boners aren't ready yet?

186
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,560
Dude, relax, man.
I'm telling you,

187
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,480
We'll get there on time,
all right?

188
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,240
Yo, dogs, what y'all think?

189
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,880
Tucked in or out?

190
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,520
- Out, man.
- Out, man. Come on.

191
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,920
No doubt. No doubt.
That's what I thought.

192
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,520
You fuckheads would be ready if
you weren't partying all night.

193
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,800
Come on, man.
It was so awesome.

194
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,120
We got so wasted, man!

195
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,760
I had, like, a keg myself.

196
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,800
I woke up naked
in a tub of ice.

197
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,840
All right!

198
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,245
Yeah, man.

199
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,400
Oh, shit, Ray,
you got a tattoo.

200
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,600
Oh, shit.
What's it say?

201
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,720
"Ray!" Oh, man.

202
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,560
Oh, shit,
you got a tattoo, too.

203
00:09:49,595 --> 00:09:50,600
Oh, really? Dude!

204
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,400
Dude, what's it say?

205
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,880
"Fucked me. "

206
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,760
Oh, sweet, man.
"Ray... "

207
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,960
"Fucked me. "

208
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
- "Ray... "
- "Fucked me. "

209
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,800
"Ray fucked me. "

210
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,600
Yeah! Ha ha! Whoo!

211
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,560
What, man?

212
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,800
Oh.

213
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,400
Wedgie moment! Ha ha!

214
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,720
Come on. You're gonna give me
a yeast infection.

215
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,320
Hey, girl, that jacket
is slamming.

216
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,280
Thanks.

217
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,400
You better be careful,
though.

218
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,640
Some girl
got an ass-whipping...

219
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,320
over a jacket
stolen earlier today.

220
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,560
Some people is so ghetto.

221
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,640
What class we got next?

222
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,720
Psychology.

223
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,840
Oh! Me, too! 101?

224
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,640
- In room 302 at 10?00?
- That's it!

225
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,080
Oh! Uh-uh!
No. This is too much.

226
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,320
I got these psychic powers
on line.

227
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,760
Remind me to get
a lotto ticket tomorrow.

228
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,680
Oh, don't split the pole now.

229
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,360
That is very, very bad luck.
My psychic told me.

230
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,680
You don't really believe
in that stuff, do you?

231
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,600
Yes, I do. Very much.

232
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,080
Are these all the subjects?

233
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,120
Yes, sir.
I took the liberty of putting...

234
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,440
those with near-death
experiences on the very top.

235
00:10:55,475 --> 00:10:56,845
Any of them hot?

236
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,960
As I'm sure you are aware,
Professor...

237
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,040
subjects who are close to death
are statistically more likely...

238
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,720
to have
the suggestibility required...

239
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,640
for paranormal investigation,
which is why, of course...

240
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,440
I gave them
special consideration.

241
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,000
Oh, good thinking, Dwight.

242
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,320
Traumatized coeds
are a sure thing.

243
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,520
Ooh, I like her.

244
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,780
Oh, yes, sir.
That is Cindy Campbell--

245
00:11:20,815 --> 00:11:23,000
classic abandoned
personality disorder.

246
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,840
She seems guarded,
but willing.

247
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,400
And this?

248
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,000
That is Ray Wilkins, sir.

249
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,520
I couldn't quite
figure him out...

250
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,760
but he seemed very eager
and pleased to meet me.

251
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,920
What's this?

252
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:39,480
It's a picture that he sent
after the interview.

253
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,280
Where did you find these kids?

254
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,760
Sir, they're all survivors...

255
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,320
of the Stevenston County
Massacre.

256
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,640
Oh, fantastic!

257
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,120
These kids are exactly
the catalyst we need...

258
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,680
to awaken
the spirits of Hell House.

259
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,000
Sir, exactly how are we going
to get them up there?

260
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,600
We'll tell them...

261
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,160
it's part of the class.

262
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,240
We'll say--excuse me--

263
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,520
that they're participating
in a study...

264
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,840
of sleep disorders.

265
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,640
We are going
to make history, Dwight--

266
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,960
the first documented...

267
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,520
unrefuted evidence
of life after death.

268
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,720
Welcome, everybody.

269
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,800
I'm Professor Oldman.

270
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,520
Each of you have been
carefully selected...

271
00:12:24,555 --> 00:12:25,880
to be in this class...

272
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,560
for which you receive
an automatic grade of "A"...

273
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,365
upon completion.

274
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,720
Now, this year's study
is insomnia.

275
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,320
We are going to spend
the weekend together...

276
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,800
where we've established
a controlled environment...

277
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:45,600
in which we'll study
your various sleep disorders.

278
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,880
Now, I'll be passing out
directions--

279
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,120
- I can do it.
- No.

280
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,720
- No, Dwight.
- I can do it.

281
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,880
I can... myself... do it.

282
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,800
Now,
you should all be there...

283
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:00,280
by 6 p. m. tonight
and plan to stay through Monday.

284
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,920
I'll see you all this evening.

285
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,160
Hey!

286
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,480
You left your book
back there.

287
00:13:05,515 --> 00:13:08,000
Oh. Thanks.

288
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,400
I'm Cindy.

289
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,000
- Buddy.
- Hey.

290
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,920
So, looks like we're gonna
spend the weekend together.

291
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,200
Yeah.

292
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,360
You want to get together
and study or something?

293
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,520
Study? Ha!

294
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,520
That was kind of bad.

295
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,760
Ha, ha, ha!

296
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,920
I'm sorry, Buddy.

297
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,720
You seem like
a really nice guy...

298
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,880
but I just got out of
a really bad relationship...

299
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,080
so I'm not quite ready
to start dating yet.

300
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,880
Oh.

301
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,120
But, hey, you know,
maybe we could be friends.

302
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,200
Sure. Yeah. Cool.
That--friends.

303
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,280
OK. See you later, friend.

304
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,120
All right, pal.

305
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,720
Oh!

306
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,080
Wedgie! Smell you later!

307
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:54,280
As we go on, we remember

308
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,960
All the good times

309
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,840
We had together

310
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,320
As our lives change

311
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,560
Come whatever

312
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,800
We will still be

313
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,360
Friends forever

314
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,960
Hey!
Will you shut the fuck up...

315
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,280
and let me sing?

316
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,960
La, la, la, la, la, la, la

317
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,640
La, la, la, la, la, la, la...

318
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,800
Ow!

319
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,240
Hello?

320
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,160
Oh!

321
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,080
Hello?

322
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,240
Hello?

323
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,000
Hi, little guy.
Look at you.

324
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,160
Little? I'm not little.

325
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,040
I'm hung like a bull, lady.
Check it out.

326
00:15:27,075 --> 00:15:28,840
You ever seen
a bird dick this big?

327
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,320
Too much for you, huh, baby?

328
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,280
Yeah.

329
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,200
All right.
Step off then, sweet cheeks.

330
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,920
Come back when you want
some real loving.

331
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,200
OK.

332
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,600
Fucking tease.

333
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,120
Hello?

334
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,520
Aah!

335
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,800
Oh, I'm--I'm sorry, child.

336
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,485
Did I frighten you, child?

337
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:06,320
Oh, I'm sorry.
Are you scared?

338
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,640
All right.
I'll sing to you.

339
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:13,400
God is in his holy temple

340
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,160
Better?

341
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,560
I'm here with
Professor Oldman's group.

342
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,760
I'm Hanson.
I'm the caretaker.

343
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,360
- Hi.
- Hi.

344
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,760
And what's your name,
sweet child?

345
00:16:28,795 --> 00:16:29,920
I'm Cindy.

346
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,360
Cindy.

347
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,920
Oh, but the resemblance
is striking.

348
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:39,400
Look at the thin cheek bones
and the same lips.

349
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,520
Same--same eyes.

350
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,840
Look at your hair.

351
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,800
Oh, I'm sorry.

352
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,960
You've got the same nose.

353
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,240
Tickle, tickle.

354
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,480
Be-boop, be-boop
on the nose.

355
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,000
Ha, ha, ha!

356
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,440
Shall I show you to your room?

357
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,160
Oh! Oh, that's heavy.
Whoo! That's heavy!

358
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,360
I better use my strong hand.

359
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,640
- Oh! Clumsy.
- Oh! No, that's fine.

360
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,440
Look, you got the panties--

361
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,840
I can take care of it.

362
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,440
Look at--
Oh, what you got here?

363
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,040
Ah!

364
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,320
Can't forget your toothbrush.

365
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,480
Oh!

366
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,800
Gonna need that for later.

367
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,520
OK. Here we go.
Follow me, child.

368
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,160
- Oh, God.
- Watch my bottom.

369
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,320
Coming through.

370
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,160
Come on. Right this way.

371
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,320
Here we are.

372
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,120
So, um, do you
live here by yourself?

373
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,880
Well, yes.
We've tried to rent it out...

374
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,000
but people don't seem
to want to stay very long.

375
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,520
Ha ha!
Oh, there's old Mother Kane...

376
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,600
and that's old Master Kane.

377
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,200
Who's that?

378
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,200
That's Big Daddy Kane.

379
00:17:41,235 --> 00:17:42,280
Oh.

380
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,400
Oh, he's cute.

381
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,400
Oh, yeah.

382
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,240
That was the master's
favorite toy.

383
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,880
I don't know what
it's doing out here.

384
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,360
I swear.
Sometimes I think...

385
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,920
these toys have
a mind of their own.

386
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,720
Ow! Ow!

387
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,600
Right this way.

388
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,680
Oh, no, no, no.
Not that room, sweetheart.

389
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,880
No. That was the master's
mistress's room.

390
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:15,720
Yeah, he kind of was
a little bit of a hornball.

391
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,600
No. You go and stay
right over here.

392
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,560
This was the room that belonged
to the love of his life...

393
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,680
his wife, Caroline.

394
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,040
I'll show it to you.

395
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,520
Oh! Watch. My fanny's
coming through.

396
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,600
Watch it.
Make room for fanny.

397
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,760
Oh, wow! It's beautiful.

398
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,960
Well, thank you, child.

399
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,800
You know,
I have been working out.

400
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,880
I've been doing
my bun busters every day.

401
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,400
I squeeze really tight,
and then I let loose.

402
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,960
I squeeze really tight...

403
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,360
and then let loose.
[ Farting ]

404
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,360
Ooh!

405
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,160
OK. Ooh!

406
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,000
Oh, yes.

407
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,200
Look at this.

408
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,280
Caroline looked beautiful
in that dress.

409
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,480
In fact, she always
looked her best.

410
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,480
Do you know that
she used to entertain...

411
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,200
for royalty
and common folk and...

412
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,000
even the President
of the United States.

413
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,040
Ew.

414
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,200
Oh!

415
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,240
Oh, don't be frightened, child.

416
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,280
This is just Mr. Kittles.

417
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,640
He was the master's
favorite pet.

418
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,040
He's been in the family
for generations.

419
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,440
Look at him.
He hasn't aged a day.

420
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,060
All right, child,
I think I'll take my leave.

421
00:19:28,095 --> 00:19:31,640
You let me know
if there's anything you need.

422
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,440
Yes, and as you
can see, Professor...

423
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,960
I've taken care
of everything...

424
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,040
including medical supplies
and blood storage.

425
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,560
We want to be safe.

426
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,120
Are these cameras
all throughout the house?

427
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,520
Yes, sir. I thought
that would be best.

428
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,320
So if one of
our little chickadees...

429
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,320
were to be taking a shower...

430
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,400
which button would I press
to get a closeup?

431
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,960
That one.

432
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,120
This one? [ Beep ]

433
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,720
Ha!

434
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,080
Excuse me, Professor...

435
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,680
but your guests
have begun to arrive...

436
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,360
and supper
shall be served shortly.

437
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,480
OK. Thanks, handyman.

438
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,365
I'm actually the caretaker.

439
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,400
Oh, aren't those
cool new skates?

440
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,840
Now, you be careful
with those.

441
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,760
Don't want to fall
and break something.

442
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,000
Oh, that's funny.
That's real funny.

443
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:18,520
Let me give you a hand.

444
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,800
Well, that--that's
awful kind of you.

445
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,000
How about you give me
a standing ovation?

446
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,320
Why don't you lift me up?

447
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,040
Oh! OK. I see where
you're going with this one.

448
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,760
You look familiar to me.
Were you in "Stomp"?

449
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,600
Hey, you can kiss my grits.

450
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,640
I think I'll be the bigger man
now and walk away.

451
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,760
Walk away.

452
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,920
Um, I'll go
and change for dinner.

453
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,320
- OK.
- I'll see you shortly.

454
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,960
Sounds good.

455
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,680
I'll just run upstairs
and jump into my jogging suit.

456
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,640
I'll be right down.

457
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,440
Hey!

458
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,640
Hey there, little guy.
How you doing?

459
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,480
Fuck off, four eyes.

460
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,880
I beg your pardon?

461
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,280
I said,
"Fuck off, four eyes. "

462
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,000
Oh, I ought to
kick your ass.

463
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,040
Hey! Hey! Hey!

464
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,240
Relax, son.
It's just a bird.

465
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,120
Hello, birdie.
Polly want a cracker?

466
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,200
Polly wants
your mama's sweet ass.

467
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,880
What did Polly say to me?

468
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,920
I said, "Polly wants
your mama's sweet ass. "

469
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,000
You don't be talking
about my mama, son.

470
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,285
You don't know my mama, son.

471
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,360
Yeah, I know your mama.
I fucked her last night.

472
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,320
You want beef?
I'll fuck you up!

473
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,160
Ooh! I'm shaking.
I'm shaking.

474
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,160
Now, fuck this.

475
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,400
I'm gonna handle this shit
like a gentleman.

476
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,400
Yo, hold my tooth, son.

477
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,840
Yeah, come on, bitch.

478
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,920
You and that
"Welcome Back, Kotter" haircut.

479
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,240
Want a piece of me?
Come on. Bring it on.

480
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,360
What, you hard core?
Give me some.

481
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,320
- Bring it on, bitch.
- No, no. What?

482
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,700
You gonna talk, son?
Then do it.

483
00:21:38,735 --> 00:21:40,000
Come on, pussy.
Let me out of here.

484
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,160
I'll fuck you up.

485
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,480
Hi, guys.

486
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,360
- Hey.
- Hey.

487
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,320
Hey, Buddy.

488
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,600
- Hey, Cin.
- How you doing?

489
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,120
Open chest!

490
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,440
Come on. You got to be
quicker than that, "A" cup.

491
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,320
Oh! Oh!

492
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,720
Hey, guys.

493
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,000
- Hey!
- How you doing?

494
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,960
Well, are you boys
just gonna sit there...

495
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,360
with your mouths open...

496
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,520
or is someone gonna
offer me a seat?

497
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,840
Oh!

498
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,920
Ow!

499
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,520
I warmed it up for you.

500
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,320
It's the best seat
in the house.

501
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,600
Second best.

502
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,800
Ew.

503
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,040
Professor,
is this the same house...

504
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,320
that a young girl
was possessed by a demon...

505
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,440
or something?

506
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,000
Yes, it was reported
but never substantiated.

507
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,080
All right. Well, uh...

508
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,680
who'd like some appetizers?

509
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,960
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

510
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,080
That's what I like to hear.

511
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,320
Hey, these buns look good.

512
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,280
Oh, yeah...

513
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,740
and they're so soft and warm.

514
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:40,160
- Ray!
- Oh, I'm sorry. My bad.

515
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,520
These are delicious.

516
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,080
Thank you, my child.

517
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,320
I made them by hand.

518
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,160
OK!

519
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,120
Here we go. I think
the taters are just about done.

520
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:56,080
I'm just gonna give them
one quick whisk here.

521
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,000
OK, now. Dig in.

522
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,200
All right.

523
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,960
Now it's time for the turkey.

524
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,800
Oh, what a beautiful bird.

525
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,840
- No!
- No, man!

526
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,480
Hey! Hey! Hey, man.

527
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,440
Why don't you
just relax...

528
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,880
and just let me
do that for you?

529
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,560
- Yeah.
- Rest that little hand.

530
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,840
It's my pleasure, but what
a nice young man to offer.

531
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:25,120
Let me give you
a little pinch there.

532
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,240
Come on.

533
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,565
Fuck it!

534
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,000
You know, a lot of people...

535
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,760
are kind of intimidated...

536
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,480
about making a turkey,
but...

537
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,840
really it's very simple.

538
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,440
You just have to know
the anatomy of a turkey...

539
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,040
and it's got, over here...

540
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,320
just the tiniest
little stinkhole...

541
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,160
but it's big enough
to get your hand...

542
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,680
right up inside it.

543
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,800
Uh!

544
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,240
Stuff the shit out of it.

545
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,080
I cook it
with all the giblets--

546
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,760
the penises
and the ginies...

547
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,920
And now, a lot of people
like to baste their turkeys...

548
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,120
but I use this.

549
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,880
I lick like that...

550
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,680
and get
into the little...

551
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,560
hiney... hiney ho...

552
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,960
That's nice and good.

553
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,640
I don't know
what the hell that is...

554
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,000
but I'll lick it anyway.

555
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,280
Up and down...

556
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,280
and then I like to get
that right on there...

557
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,120
Hiawatha!

558
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,520
And I got one of these.

559
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,800
I'm gonna pull that off...

560
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,720
and bam! That just
kicks it up a little bit.

561
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,320
All right.
I think that's almost...

562
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,600
ready now.

563
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,920
And then we
bring it to the table.

564
00:24:27,955 --> 00:24:30,480
Mmm, good.

565
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,120
All right.

566
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,840
Who's ready for a wing?

567
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,560
Yours or the turkey's?

568
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,720
Ha, ha, ha!

569
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,680
I just thought
that was funny.

570
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,560
Well, I know what you'd like.

571
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,000
How about a leg?

572
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,920
Whoo!

573
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,640
How about two? Ha ha!

574
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,920
How about
I take these two legs...

575
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,200
and shove
them right up your ass--

576
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,280
all the way to the knee!

577
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,240
Dwight. Dwight, relax.

578
00:24:52,275 --> 00:24:53,880
Hanson...

579
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,520
may I ask you is there
something on the menu...

580
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,360
that you haven't
personally prepared?

581
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,760
Well, I ordered out
the dessert.

582
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,160
All right!

583
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,120
Make room.

584
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,080
Here comes the pie.

585
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,160
All right. OK. Mmm.

586
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,220
Who wants the first piece
of that pie?

587
00:25:12,255 --> 00:25:15,240
Huh? I see you
eyeing the first piece.

588
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,480
Oh, that's good.

589
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,160
Mm mmm.
Pass that down to her.

590
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,600
Thank you.

591
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,080
That's nice.

592
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,560
My germs.

593
00:25:24,595 --> 00:25:26,000
Ha, ha, ha!

594
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,360
My germs.

595
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,240
Ha, ha, ha! My germs!
Ha, ha, ha!

596
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,120
Hey...

597
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:46,320
Come play with me.

598
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,240
Come play.

599
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,480
Ha ha!

600
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,600
Hello?

601
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,520
Ooh!

602
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,640
Cindy... Cindy.

603
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,120
Who is it?

604
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,000
I want to help you, Cindy.

605
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,200
Who are you?

606
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,280
You're in danger, Cindy.

607
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,840
I want to help you.

608
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,560
Help me how?
Who's in danger?

609
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,360
Check the music room.

610
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,720
Where are you?

611
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,480
Check
the fucking music room!

612
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,720
Hey, Cindy, think fast!

613
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,560
Ohh! Uhh! Aah!

614
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,440
Dude, you suck!

615
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,800
Ow.

616
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,560
Buddy...

617
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,960
about
this friendship thing--

618
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,560
Yeah, I think it is so cool
having a girl as a friend.

619
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,200
That's just it, Buddy.

620
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,800
I am a girl.

621
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,565
You can't be so rough
with me.

622
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,360
Well, then what the hell
are we supposed to do?

623
00:27:51,395 --> 00:27:53,680
Gentle stuff.

624
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,720
You know, like talking and...

625
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,600
sharing secrets
and past experiences.

626
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,040
You know, stuff like that.

627
00:28:01,075 --> 00:28:03,440
That sounds kind of gay.

628
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,560
I guess since you're a girl
it's all right.

629
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,040
- Yeah. It'll be fine.
- All right.

630
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,400
Hey, listen. Will you come
check something out with me?

631
00:28:10,435 --> 00:28:12,560
Sure. We can practice
our talking.

632
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,885
Yeah. Exactly.

633
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,960
I want to tell you
about this thing...

634
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,320
that happened to me
when I was in high school.

635
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,760
Really? What happened?

636
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,040
This hot Spanish chick's
licking my nuts--

637
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,000
Buddy!

638
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,880
No, no.
This is the best part.

639
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,120
Oh, my God. Look.

640
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,240
Oh, dude!
Someone's on the rag!

641
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,840
Shh!

642
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,000
They lead straight
to the bookcase.

643
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,520
God.

644
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,680
Must be a secret study
or something.

645
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,360
Wow.

646
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,280
Oh, my God.

647
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,840
It says Hugh Kane
and his mistress...

648
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,440
were murdered
in this house.

649
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,280
Whoa. Check this out.

650
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,720
This must be his wife.

651
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,960
Oh, my God.
She looks just like you.

652
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,480
You think?

653
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,880
- She's really beautiful.
- Yeah.

654
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,800
Well, actually,
her hair doesn't have...

655
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,560
as many split ends as yours...

656
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,400
and her skin isn't
as oily as yours, either.

657
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,600
Also, sometimes your eyes
get kind of squinty...

658
00:29:31,635 --> 00:29:33,760
and you look like
you might have Down Syndrome.

659
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,520
Other than that, though,
the resemblance is uncanny.

660
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,845
Really?

661
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,125
Also, her tits are perfect.

662
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,360
They're not pointy
or funny-looking like yours...

663
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,520
or spaced too far apart.

664
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,720
OK! Enough!

665
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,800
God.

666
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,120
Oh, my God, look at this.

667
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,520
"Caroline. "

668
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,640
Must have been hers.

669
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:57,960
Oh, my God.

670
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,920
All right.
Let's get out of here.

671
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,040
This place
gives me the creeps.

672
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,520
OK. Grab the chest.

673
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,840
Oh, thanks.

674
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,080
- Buddy!
- What?

675
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,440
- I meant the chest.
- Right.

676
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,680
What the--

677
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,800
Hey.

678
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,840
Nice.

679
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,920
Mm-hmm...

680
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,520
Mmm... mmm.

681
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,740
Oh!

682
00:31:12,775 --> 00:31:14,360
Oh! OK!

683
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,920
Hello!

684
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,680
If I had known,
I would have freshened up!

685
00:31:17,715 --> 00:31:19,240
I wish you were
freshened up, too.

686
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,240
Get up there! Come on!

687
00:31:20,275 --> 00:31:21,217
Oh, you want this?

688
00:31:21,252 --> 00:31:22,186
Oh, yeah. Ooh, yeah.

689
00:31:22,221 --> 00:31:23,085
That's it, daddy.

690
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,400
Take it like you want it.

691
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,520
Give it to me!
Give it to me!

692
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,240
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

693
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,360
Yeah!

694
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,400
Come here!

695
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,680
Bring it on!

696
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,200
Kinky's my middle name, bitch!

697
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,000
Ooh, yeah!

698
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:37,000
That was the best
that I've ever had.

699
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,320
Oh. Mrs. Huey Kane.

700
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:39,800
Hmm?

701
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,760
Doesn't that just
have a ring to it?

702
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,520
Ha ha! Mmm... baby?

703
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,640
Where you going?

704
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,120
Call me!

705
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,160
Let's do something freaky.

706
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,160
Hee hee!
Like what, Ray?

707
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,600
I don't know.

708
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,280
Why don't you
talk dirty to me?

709
00:32:04,315 --> 00:32:06,920
I don't know
what to say, Ray.

710
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,040
Come on.
Just make something up.

711
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,480
Oh, Ray,
why do you make me so bad?

712
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,320
Come on.
Because you a bad girl.

713
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,040
OK.

714
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,560
I'm gonna work this.

715
00:32:20,595 --> 00:32:22,440
Yeah. Work it.

716
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,120
I'm gonna make this mine.

717
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,440
Mmm. It's all yours.
Oh, yeah.

718
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,000
I'm gonna
piss on your face...

719
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,560
and then I'm gonna fart
in your mouth.

720
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,720
Yeah! And then I'm gonna
shit on these walls, Ray!

721
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,200
Ooh!

722
00:32:33,235 --> 00:32:34,640
Hey!

723
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,480
Too dirty?

724
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,240
Hello?

725
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,640
Oh, hey, kitty, kitty.

726
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,200
Hi, little fella.

727
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,040
Aah! Aah! Aah!

728
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,960
OK. OK.

729
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,280
That's OK, cat.

730
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:13,285
I think I know
why you're mad, Mr. Cat.

731
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,200
I didn't mean to go poopie
in your litter box.

732
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,960
Help!
My pussy's gone crazy!

733
00:33:25,995 --> 00:33:28,520
Aah! Aah!

734
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,200
Ha, ha, ha!

735
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,680
Aah!

736
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,840
Oh! Aah! Aah!

737
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,720
OK. You want a piece of me?

738
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,200
Huh?

739
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,520
Yeah! How do you like that,
little pussy?

740
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,960
Come on!

741
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,880
Yeah! Yeah! Come on!

742
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,880
Aah! Ohh!

743
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,240
Is that all you got?

744
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,920
Huh? Come on!

745
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,080
Give me your best shot!

746
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,720
I'm telling you,
Professor...

747
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,360
it was possessed.

748
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,240
Theo, did you see
this animal?

749
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,400
No, I didn't.

750
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,720
I heard
all the commotion...

751
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,960
but by the time
I went in there...

752
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,640
I guess it was gone.

753
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,925
Mm-hmm.

754
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,880
What? So you think
I did this to myself?.

755
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,120
No. All I'm saying
is that cats are known...

756
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,120
to be very
territorial animals...

757
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,080
and it's likely
that it did attack...

758
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,680
but that doesn't mean
it was possessed.

759
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:57,000
Maybe you two should
sleep together.

760
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,360
What are you getting at,
Professor?

761
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,600
I'm just saying that if indeed
this cat did attack...

762
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,200
it's less likely to come back
if the two of you were...

763
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,480
let's say... together.

764
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,520
Oh, come on, it's college.

765
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,520
It's time for you two
to experiment.

766
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,480
I don't think we're gonna
be getting much help here.

767
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,560
Oh, on the contrary,
actually...

768
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,360
I'd be more than happy
to walk you through it.

769
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,320
Come on, Cin.

770
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,280
I'll make sure
you get tucked in.

771
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,080
Good idea.

772
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,920
Don't forget to kiss
each other good night.

773
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,520
There's something going on
in this house, Professor.

774
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,400
I'm not crazy!

775
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,880
Aah!

776
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,960
1, 2...

777
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,720
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...

778
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,640
9, Brandon, 10...

779
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:45,160
11, Brandon, come on!
Count with me!

780
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,525
Hey, you.
Hee, hee, hee, hee!

781
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:10,000
Come here a minute.
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

782
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,605
Come here.

783
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,040
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

784
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,720
Peekaboo!
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

785
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,400
Come on, let's play!

786
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,120
This is a fun game, huh?

787
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,720
Hey, what are you doing?

788
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,160
Uncle Ray-Ray's got a game.

789
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,320
Hey, get your finger
out of there.

790
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,640
Tickle, tickle,
tickle, tickle...

791
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,485
Aah! Aah!

792
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,840
You want to play
with Uncle Ray?

793
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,600
Peekaboo!
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

794
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,840
Aah! Aah! Help!

795
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,680
Aah!

796
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,840
Oh, God!

797
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,360
RAY: Here's
a little balloon animal.

798
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,920
Da, da, da, da, da
da, da, da, da!

799
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,720
Ohh!

800
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,920
CINDY, VOICE-OVER? "I can't take
living with him any longer.

801
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,960
"He's becoming a monster.

802
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,720
"I suspect he was
having an affair.

803
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,360
"I believe he's sleeping
with our baby-sitter Victoria.

804
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,760
"It must be why
he keeps her around...

805
00:37:08,795 --> 00:37:11,400
"because we have
no children. "

806
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,200
Cindy...

807
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:16,360
I want you to know
what happened, Cindy.

808
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,200
Hello, Cindy.

809
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,960
Hello, Professor.

810
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,960
I take it you're not
mad at me anymore.

811
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,280
I wouldn't go that far,
Professor.

812
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,800
Why don't you just relax?

813
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,720
Hey!

814
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,000
Uh, uh...

815
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,760
Aha.

816
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,160
Ha ha.

817
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,320
Uh-huh.

818
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,600
I think she's starting
to suspect something.

819
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,840
Who?

820
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,080
Your wife.

821
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,520
Aah!

822
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,960
Oh, my God.

823
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,120
It happened right here.

824
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,080
What?

825
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,480
She came home.

826
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,920
- She saw them!
- Saw who?

827
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,520
I was in my room
reading her journal.

828
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,680
Then I found this dress
in the closet.

829
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,240
That's all I remember.

830
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,680
What about you, Ray?

831
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,440
Oh, I bought mine
on Friday.

832
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,520
I just came down
to get a banana.

833
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,080
Shit is hot, right?

834
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,920
You're a nice little plant.

835
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,480
You drink all this
little water up...

836
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,240
so you can grow up to be
a nice strong charon plant.

837
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,000
Yes. Yes.

838
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,040
And then you'll be smoked
by all the rappers...

839
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,040
and make them do
a whole lot of dumb shit...

840
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,440
that fuck up their careers.

841
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,200
Yes, you will.

842
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,000
Night-night, baby.

843
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,040
I'm gonna rob
that bitch tonight.

844
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,440
Lockdown Records presents...

845
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,040
A Hip-Hop Christmas.

846
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,280
You'll get such classics...

847
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,840
As "Santa Claus
Is Coming on Moms... "

848
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,600
That's the shit, son!

849
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,520
"I'm Dreaming
of a White Woman... "

850
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,600
and who could forget
"Frosty the Dopeman"?

851
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,520
And how about
"All I want for Christmas...

852
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,720
Is the Charges Dropped... "

853
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,840
"Deez Nuts Roasting
On an Open Fire... "

854
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,680
"A Sleigh Ride In My '64... "

855
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,280
"Ante Up, Bitch,
It's Christmas... "

856
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,240
and many more!

857
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,560
Yo, I'm gonna buy
that shit, son!

858
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,480
Just $19. 95...

859
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,040
Aah!

860
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,560
I'm sorry! I didn't mean
to smoke your relatives!

861
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,200
Please! No!

862
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,440
I didn't do it by myself!

863
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,600
Whitney and Bobby helped me!

864
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,480
Please! Help me!

865
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,760
Aah! Shit, son!

866
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,320
Wait! No! Please!

867
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:03,120
Oh! Oh, shit, son!

868
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,480
Oh, shit!

869
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,000
Oh, my God!

870
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,040
Aah! Oh, shit!
I smell something burning!

871
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,320
Oh, stop! It's me!

872
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,680
I got an idea!

873
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,400
Oh, wait a second!

874
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,840
Hold on, Shorty!

875
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,000
Don't rescue me yet.

876
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,800
I'm getting high
as a motherfucker!

877
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,360
Toke, toke, toke, toke!

878
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,400
Take it to the head!
Take it to the head!

879
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,280
Oh, you take it
like a bitch.

880
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,880
Put the Shorty down...

881
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,960
and I'll give you
Funyons and Cheetos.

882
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:38,880
Oh, shit!

883
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,840
This shit burns
more than a perm!

884
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,400
Aah!

885
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,360
Ha, ha, ha!

886
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,920
There's a whole lot
of freaky shit...

887
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,920
going on in this house.

888
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,240
There's more to this story
than the Professor told us.

889
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:57,040
Last night,
I found a secret room...

890
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,240
and I found all these
newspaper clippings...

891
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,240
about Hugh Kane.

892
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:03,080
He was a really evil man.

893
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:06,920
And I found a picture
of his wife.

894
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,280
Oh, my God!
She looks just like you.

895
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,400
You think?

896
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,800
She doesn't have
as many split ends...

897
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,040
and her skin's
not as oily as yours.

898
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,605
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

899
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,200
Sometimes you do this little
squinty thing with your eyes.

900
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,120
It looks like you got
Down Syndrome or something.

901
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,200
Oh, yeah,
y'all look just alike...

902
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,480
except she got
some perfect boobs...

903
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,400
and yours look like
them old orangutan titties.

904
00:41:26,435 --> 00:41:28,360
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
Shit, son!

905
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,320
I'll put you in the full nelson
and lick them.

906
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,920
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

907
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:37,440
OK! Enough!

908
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,880
Anyway, I think
she killed him...

909
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,920
and now he wants me.

910
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,720
Yeah. Right, bitch.

911
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,080
Morning, Dwight.
Let me help you.

912
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,320
I don't need your help.

913
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,680
I can do it myself.

914
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,280
Aah!

915
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,400
OK. Professor,
uh, we need to talk.

916
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,680
What is it, Dwight?

917
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:12,760
I think
you should consider...

918
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,600
cutting the experiment short.

919
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,000
What?

920
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,400
This poltergeist is growing
increasingly more violent.

921
00:42:18,435 --> 00:42:19,920
I think we're all
in danger here...

922
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,720
and I've got to put
my foot down...

923
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,360
and stand up for
what I believe in...

924
00:42:23,395 --> 00:42:24,960
and say that
we've got to pull the plug.

925
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,160
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, Dwight.

926
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,000
I say when we pull the plug.

927
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,440
We are on the verge
of greatness...

928
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:34,720
and I am this close
to getting laid.

929
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,160
Now, the bus arrives
on Monday.

930
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,045
No one leaves till then.

931
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,000
Here are
the keys to the gate.

932
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,640
No one gets access to them.

933
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,560
Yes, sir.

934
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,760
Guys, I think
the Professor's up to something.

935
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,360
I heard Dwight
tell the Professor...

936
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,640
there could be
a poltergeist in the house...

937
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,760
and that we could all
be in danger!

938
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,520
Oh, no, son!
Not a poltergeist!

939
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,200
What's a poltergeist?

940
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,280
I'm getting out of here.

941
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,840
No. We can't go anywhere.
The gates are locked.

942
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,360
Dwight's the only one
who has the keys.

943
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,280
- Baby, get my Vaseline.
- I'll handle--

944
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,560
Get my Vaseline, a banana,
and some duct tape.

945
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,520
I'm gonna break his legs.

946
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,000
I'm gonna fuck
that little cripple up!

947
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,080
Guys, just give me
five minutes alone with him.

948
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,920
I'll get the keys.

949
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,960
Hello, Dwight.

950
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,240
Oh.

951
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,040
Hi, Theo.

952
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,200
What you working on?

953
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:32,600
Uh, just a little experiment.

954
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,960
Oh. Work, work, work.

955
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,040
Is that all you ever do?

956
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:41,160
Well, there's a lot
riding on this project.

957
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,000
You know, the Professor...

958
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,640
might have
everyone else fooled...

959
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:47,160
but I know
who the real brains...

960
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,600
behind this operation is.

961
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:52,440
Oh, yeah? You do, huh?

962
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,520
Mm-hmm. That's what
turns me on about you.

963
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,280
You're so smart.

964
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:58,480
Ahh.

965
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:01,760
And those sexy eyes.

966
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,840
Ha ha. Oh!

967
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,840
Why don't I put
some music on, huh?

968
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:10,920
Yeah. Music.

969
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,440
Wha--

970
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:15,360
You know, Dwight...

971
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,560
I hear
you're the only one...

972
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,760
who has
the keys to the gate.

973
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,040
Uhh...

974
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,200
Ha. That's true.
It is. I'm--

975
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,480
Correct.

976
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:26,920
What if...

977
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,320
I wanted to borrow
those keys?

978
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:34,960
Oh, dear sweet God in Heaven.

979
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,080
I... yaaa, I can't.

980
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,680
Oh, come on.
Yes, you can, baby.

981
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,285
- No.
- Please? I mean--

982
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:46,200
Look. You help me
by giving me the keys...

983
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:49,440
and I'll help by giving you...
[ Zip ]

984
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,040
Hey, wait, wait, wait!
Whoa!

985
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,320
Hey, I don't need
your help, OK, lady?

986
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,920
I can do it myself.

987
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,720
Woo-hoo!

988
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,680
Hey, look!

989
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:03,840
I'm tossing my own salad!

990
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:05,360
Ow!

991
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,760
Oh.

992
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,520
So this is your secret room.

993
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,720
Well...

994
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,920
this just isn't
gonna work now, is it?

995
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:32,720
Oh, Professor.

996
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,120
Come over here.

997
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,160
Uh-huh!

998
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,720
This way, you big hunk.

999
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,160
Ahem.

1000
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,080
Have we met?

1001
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,520
Follow me.

1002
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,240
Are you playing
a little game?

1003
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:55,600
Where are you?

1004
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:58,760
Come here, baby.

1005
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,560
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

1006
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:07,600
No!

1007
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:09,760
Aah!

1008
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,000
- Is everybody here?
- Yeah.

1009
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,680
All right. Let's go.

1010
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,240
- Oh!
- Oh, shit, son!

1011
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:20,040
He's not gonna
let us out of here!

1012
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,160
He's gonna kill us!

1013
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,520
Oh, look.
A rocket scientist.

1014
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,160
All right. Quick.
Everybody to the laboratory.

1015
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:28,120
Move! Come on! Hurry up!

1016
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,840
You all are fucked!

1017
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,920
Lock the door.

1018
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,120
OK. We have to destroy it.

1019
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,120
That's great.

1020
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,840
How are we gonna destroy
what we can't see?

1021
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,320
I got it!

1022
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:41,880
We'll shave off
our pubic hairs...

1023
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,880
and wear the shampoo
for two weeks!

1024
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,080
No. Listen. Listen.

1025
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,680
We're gonna use these guns.

1026
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:50,520
They emit a bolt
of concentrated energy...

1027
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,960
which can damage
the ectoplasmic cells...

1028
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,240
and destroy the ghost.

1029
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,360
Now, there's no more ammunition.

1030
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,600
Conserve it. Use it wisely.

1031
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,040
- Shut up.
- Ow!

1032
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:01,800
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

1033
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:05,000
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Conserve your ammunition.

1034
00:47:05,035 --> 00:47:07,000
My bad.

1035
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,120
All right.
Now, the only way...

1036
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,480
we're gonna be able
to track these ghosts...

1037
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,680
is if we're all wearing
one of these.

1038
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:12,800
These are thermo goggles.

1039
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,680
They work on the principle
of body heat.

1040
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,800
They're so powerful,
they can detect...

1041
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,360
where any bodily fluids
have been...

1042
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,200
even if
they've been wiped clean.

1043
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:24,920
What?

1044
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,880
Ew.

1045
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:29,200
Are my glasses crooked?

1046
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:32,160
Now listen,
that ghost may be invisible...

1047
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,840
but we have the advantage
of being armed...

1048
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:35,720
with the most sophisticated
high-tech equipment...

1049
00:47:35,755 --> 00:47:36,840
known to man.

1050
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,000
How do we stay in touch
with each other?

1051
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,800
Do we have
some walkie-talkies?

1052
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:41,600
No. We have these.

1053
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:44,960
Those is Dixie cups.

1054
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Well, we kind
of ran short of funds...

1055
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:50,880
after the guns
and the goggles.

1056
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,760
All right.
Now let's split up.

1057
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,800
Uh-uh! Uh-uh! Uh-uh!

1058
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:56,480
Now wait a minute!
Hold up!

1059
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:58,240
How come every time
some scary shit happens...

1060
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,920
that we need
to stick together...

1061
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,920
you white people always say,
"Let's split up"?

1062
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,320
She's right.
We should stick together.

1063
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,080
Yes!
That's what I'm saying!

1064
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,080
She's right.

1065
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:09,200
OK. You three, follow me.

1066
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:17,000
Ain't that a bitch?

1067
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,240
We're gonna die, y'all.

1068
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:33,120
Ah. Did you hear that?

1069
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,080
Hell, yeah.

1070
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:37,280
Oh! Where's Shorty?

1071
00:48:37,315 --> 00:48:38,760
I don't know.

1072
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:44,160
Shorty!

1073
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,040
Oh.

1074
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:47,960
Damn.

1075
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,920
All right.
You wait right here.

1076
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:50,880
I'll be right back.

1077
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:52,800
- OK.
- All right.

1078
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:03,160
- Wow.
- What is this?

1079
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,080
I don't know.

1080
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,760
Looks like the furnace room.

1081
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,280
- Let's go.
- No, wait.

1082
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:11,645
In that newspaper article...

1083
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,880
it said that Hugh Kane
was killed in the furnace.

1084
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:23,080
Oh, wow. Look at this.

1085
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:25,080
There's so many ashes, Buddy.

1086
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:29,400
What are you doing?

1087
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,520
Hold it.

1088
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:33,320
Aah!

1089
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,120
Aah!

1090
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,680
Let's split up.
I'll meet you on the other end.

1091
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,800
- OK.
- Wait.

1092
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:43,800
Good luck.

1093
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:45,680
I love you!

1094
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:54,480
Aah!

1095
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:55,840
- Oh, Shorty!
- Cindy!

1096
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:57,280
There's a monster chasing me.

1097
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:59,520
What are we gonna do?

1098
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:01,800
- I got it!
- Yeah?

1099
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,160
Oh!

1100
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:09,360
Shorty!

1101
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:11,760
Aah!

1102
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,600
Damn. Why does
the little bitch...

1103
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,880
got to bring that shit
over here?

1104
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:21,520
OK. Well, maybe
she won't see me.

1105
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:24,120
Somebody help me! Brenda!

1106
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,560
Shit, she saw me.

1107
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:29,920
OK. OK.

1108
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,400
Oh! Aah!

1109
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,840
Ohh!

1110
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,200
Thank you, Lord!

1111
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:37,440
Aah!

1112
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:38,960
OK. Now let
that shit just--

1113
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,360
just mutilate
her white ass and leave.

1114
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:48,405
Damn, bitch, please die!

1115
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:51,040
Oh, my God, Brenda!
We're gonna die!

1116
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:52,080
It would have
just been you...

1117
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:54,520
if you had just
shut the fuck up!

1118
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:56,020
It's coming!

1119
00:50:56,055 --> 00:50:57,480
What is it?

1120
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:00,720
Is it a monster?
Is it a monster?

1121
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,040
Cindy?

1122
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,640
This is a skeleton.
This is bones.

1123
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:11,000
Would you run
from Calista Flockhart?

1124
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:14,600
Shut your ass up.

1125
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:18,320
Ha, ha, ha!

1126
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:21,120
Look. He crazy now.

1127
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:23,200
I'm sorry, Mr. Skeleton.
Here.

1128
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:26,360
Ha! Gotcha! Psych!

1129
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,560
Have a nice trip.

1130
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:31,240
Ha, ha, ha!

1131
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,760
Hey, girl, I got an idea.

1132
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:33,960
Come on.

1133
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:37,560
SKELETON?
Ha ha. Very funny.

1134
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:39,360
Whoo!

1135
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,680
Ooh!

1136
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,720
Ha, ha, ha!

1137
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:44,320
Now get on out of here!

1138
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:45,800
Somebody gonna
catch an ass-whupping...

1139
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,040
when I come back.

1140
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:49,440
Oh, Brenda,
you are so brave.

1141
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:52,000
You know, you really are
my best friend, Cindy.

1142
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:52,960
You guys OK?

1143
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,280
- Yeah.
- Please.

1144
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:57,320
It takes more than a little bag
of bones to scare me.

1145
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:58,480
Wedgie!

1146
00:51:58,515 --> 00:51:59,565
Ha, ha, ha!

1147
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:00,880
The ghost has Buddy!

1148
00:52:00,915 --> 00:52:02,200
Ah! My ass!

1149
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,840
Brenda, do something!

1150
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,720
OK!

1151
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,200
Aah!

1152
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:08,960
I thought
I was your best friend.

1153
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,080
Was.

1154
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:12,000
I'm gonna miss you, girl!

1155
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,000
Get my gun!

1156
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,000
Oh!

1157
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,160
Are you OK?

1158
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,200
Ow.

1159
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:31,520
Oh, my God, you're bleeding.

1160
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,480
Come on. I think there's
a first-aid kit in the lab.

1161
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,040
Come on.

1162
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,840
Ooh!

1163
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:54,520
Huey... baby...

1164
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:56,400
where are you?

1165
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:02,560
My love? Are you there?

1166
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:07,760
Huey? Baby!

1167
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:10,040
Baby, I got
to talk to you.

1168
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:13,240
- No. Go away!
- Baby? Oh!

1169
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,440
Get away from me!

1170
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,040
Come on, baby.
We can work this out.

1171
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:21,280
I mean,
if we just stick together...

1172
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:23,040
no one can hurt us,
my love.

1173
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:25,280
It was just a booty call!

1174
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:28,840
Ow! Ooh! Ow! Oh!

1175
00:53:28,875 --> 00:53:29,765
Aah!

1176
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:32,400
Why won't you talk to me?

1177
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:33,640
Because you gave me crabs.

1178
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,720
Aah!

1179
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:42,360
You are the weakest link.
Good-bye!

1180
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:45,600
Aah!

1181
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:50,565
Ooh. Hey.

1182
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:53,080
How you doing?
Ha, ha, ha!

1183
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:59,560
Aah!

1184
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,360
No, no. No kissing.
No kissing.

1185
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,640
No. Leave this on.
Leave this on.

1186
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:10,880
You look beautiful
just like that.

1187
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:12,960
Yeah. Yeah. Oh! Oh!

1188
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:18,560
Oh, shit!

1189
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:19,520
Ohh!

1190
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:21,120
No, no, no.

1191
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:23,040
Don't fuck it up. Ohh.

1192
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:25,280
I've been thinking about
this whole friendship thing.

1193
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:26,920
I've never had a friend...

1194
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,160
who cared for me
the way you do.

1195
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:30,240
I mean, there's Ray...

1196
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:31,680
but he cares for me
in a different way...

1197
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:33,600
you know,
like bringing me flowers...

1198
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:34,880
and running my bath water.

1199
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:36,640
And there's nights
when I wake up screaming...

1200
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:39,080
and I look over,
and Ray's in my bed holding me.

1201
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:43,000
Anyway...

1202
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:45,400
seeing as how tonight may be
our last night together...

1203
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:46,640
I was thinking--

1204
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:49,080
That we should take our
friendship a little bit further.

1205
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:50,080
- Yes.
- Oh, Buddy!

1206
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,120
I was thinking
the exact same thing.

1207
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:55,440
This might be
our last night alive...

1208
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:57,400
and I want to take
full advantage of it.

1209
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,720
I was thinking the same thing!

1210
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,480
I want to be able to act out
our innermost fantasies.

1211
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:04,360
Oh, great.

1212
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,880
Like...

1213
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,080
I've always wanted
to walk on the moon.

1214
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:10,760
Huh?

1215
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:20,480
Buuuuudyyyy.

1216
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:22,120
Ha, ha, ha!

1217
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:24,160
What about you, Buddy?
What do you want to do?

1218
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:27,000
Well...

1219
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,800
He's in here.

1220
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:30,960
Oh!

1221
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:40,160
Aah! Aah! Aah!

1222
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:48,760
Oh, my God.
He locked us in.

1223
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:51,000
You should call for help.

1224
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:53,760
Hello! Hello.
Can you hear me?

1225
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,280
Come in! Come in!

1226
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,760
Copy! Do you copy me?

1227
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:01,200
We have a situation here!

1228
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:02,440
Breaker!

1229
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:04,960
Oh, my God.

1230
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,400
They can't hear me!

1231
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:08,960
Must be these walls
or something.

1232
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:16,760
OK. All right.

1233
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:19,320
You stay down here.
I'll go check upstairs.

1234
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:21,080
OK.

1235
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,600
Ow!

1236
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:29,720
Ah!

1237
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,640
- Do you need help or--
- No!

1238
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:32,885
OK.

1239
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:34,400
What do I look like to you?

1240
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:36,160
Just trying to be nice.

1241
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,160
Cover me!

1242
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,400
What do you want me to do?

1243
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:39,840
Cover me!

1244
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:43,360
Not literally.
I'm serpentining!

1245
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,840
They taught me that--

1246
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,600
Merchant marines.
Two years.

1247
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:50,360
Spent two years
on my belly in Danang.

1248
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,085
- Yeah.
- Look!

1249
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:54,360
Look. Look what
the cripple's doing.

1250
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,480
Oh, shit.

1251
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:58,440
Ow-ow-ow!

1252
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:00,600
Look, I know you're proud.
Just let me help you up--

1253
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:03,000
Step it back, candy pants!

1254
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:04,440
Fine.

1255
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,440
Oh, what are we gonna do?

1256
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:10,560
I'm cold.

1257
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:13,240
I can't feel my body,
I'm so cold.

1258
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:14,680
Buddy, can you feel this?

1259
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:15,640
No.

1260
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,360
Try a little higher.

1261
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,160
What about that?

1262
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,120
Mm-mmm.

1263
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:23,720
Keep rubbing. Ohh.

1264
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:27,800
Oh, Buddy,
I don't think I'm re--

1265
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:31,160
Cindy, please!
It's a matter of life and death.

1266
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,560
I'm asking you...

1267
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,600
in the name of love.

1268
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,920
OK, Buddy.

1269
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:43,360
In the name of love.

1270
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:45,600
Ohh.

1271
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:50,480
Mmm. Ohh.

1272
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:52,240
Oh, Cindy...

1273
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:54,960
I don't know how much longer
I can hold on.

1274
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,800
Don't you say
your good-byes.

1275
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:58,200
You're gonna
get out of here...

1276
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:00,000
and you're gonna go on...

1277
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:02,360
and you're gonna
have lots of little babies.

1278
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,200
And you're gonna
die an old man...

1279
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:05,160
Old man.

1280
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,920
Warm in his bed.

1281
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,360
- Not here!
- No.

1282
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,440
- Not like this!
- Amen.

1283
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,560
- Do you understand me?
- Oh, yeah.

1284
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,600
Coming to this house
was the best thing...

1285
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:16,120
that ever happened to me.

1286
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,120
Oh, me, too.

1287
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:20,320
And for that...
I am so thankful.

1288
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:21,280
Oh, don't let go.

1289
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:23,040
Never!
I'll never let go!

1290
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,920
- I feel weak.
- Buddy!

1291
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,200
- I'm com--
- Come back!

1292
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:27,240
Aah!

1293
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:31,080
All right, Dwight Hartman...

1294
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:34,160
it's your time to shine.

1295
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:36,120
All right. Come on.

1296
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,440
Come on, Kane.

1297
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,240
Show yourself!

1298
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,760
Look. I don't even need
my thermal goggles.

1299
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:53,240
Aah!

1300
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:55,920
Ha, ha, ha!

1301
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,480
Oh!

1302
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:00,200
Aah!

1303
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:03,520
Ah. Ah.

1304
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:10,240
Ow!

1305
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:16,880
That's right, mother--

1306
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,080
Ha, ha, ha!

1307
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:19,040
Whoa!

1308
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,680
Ow-ow-ow!

1309
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:21,720
Ha, ha, ha!

1310
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,840
Aah!

1311
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:25,240
Hey, Kane, you hungry?

1312
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:27,280
How about
a little snack of this?

1313
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:28,680
Ha ha!

1314
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,600
Aah!

1315
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:33,680
Ow. Ow. No. Ow.

1316
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:35,400
Ow-ow-ow.

1317
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:42,440
Gotcha!

1318
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:52,120
Aaargh!

1319
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:55,640
I know what you're thinking.

1320
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:59,440
Did I fire 3 shots or 117?

1321
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:02,840
Well, do you feel lucky...

1322
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:04,280
punk?

1323
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:07,320
Do you... feel lucky?

1324
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:08,760
Do you feel lucky, punk?

1325
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:09,960
Shoot me, motherfucker!

1326
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:18,320
OK. Fine.

1327
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:20,520
Make your best move, ass bite.

1328
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:38,680
- Raaa!
- Aaah!

1329
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:44,080
Oh. Whayaaa!

1330
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:45,520
Whoa!

1331
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:46,760
Whoo!

1332
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:49,760
Aah!

1333
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:01,120
Uh.

1334
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:02,760
Help!

1335
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:04,920
Help!

1336
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,520
Here. Take my hand.

1337
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:08,920
Ahh!

1338
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:10,400
Come on.

1339
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:12,560
You're gonna fall
unless you take my hand...

1340
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:13,840
No. Give me
your other hand.

1341
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:16,640
No. My other hand
isn't strong enough.

1342
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:17,840
You take my little hand.

1343
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:19,600
No! Get it away from me!

1344
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:22,160
Take it! Take my hand!

1345
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:25,680
Aah!

1346
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:28,760
Eww.

1347
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:33,440
No.

1348
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:34,400
No. Why me?

1349
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:35,800
No. Come on. No.

1350
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:38,240
I've served you well.
Don't you do this to me.

1351
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:40,160
No, please. Please, no.

1352
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:43,040
Ple-ple-ple--Aah!

1353
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:45,000
OK, Buddy.

1354
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:47,680
It's time for us
to get out of here.

1355
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:20,640
Roger. Roger.
Come in, Roger.

1356
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:21,800
Ray, this is Cindy.

1357
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:22,840
I don't want
to talk to Cindy.

1358
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:23,960
I want to talk to Roger.

1359
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,880
Roger, where you at, man?
Quit fucking around.

1360
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:27,600
Ray, listen.
The ghost is close.

1361
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:29,240
He almost got us.
Buddy's hurt.

1362
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,560
- What's your location?
- I'm right behind you.

1363
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:33,760
Ray, thank God.
OK. Where's Shorty?

1364
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:35,680
I don't--I don't know.

1365
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:37,085
He was here
just a minute ago.

1366
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:39,120
Listen,
you go help Buddy in the lab.

1367
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:41,720
- I'll go check upstairs.
- All right.

1368
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:45,920
Mmm. That smells good.

1369
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:47,000
Hello, Cindy.

1370
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:50,160
Say heloo to Cindy, Shorty.

1371
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:53,880
Heloo... Cindy.

1372
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:54,840
Shorty, are you OK?

1373
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,480
Talk to me!

1374
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:59,680
Morphine? Chloroform?

1375
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:01,280
Horse tranquilizers?
You drugged him!

1376
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:03,800
I did not.
That's all his stuff.

1377
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:04,800
Yaah!

1378
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:06,360
All right, Shorty.

1379
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:07,960
Who's ready
for the main course?

1380
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,520
Me! Me.

1381
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:11,320
Oh, Hanson, please.

1382
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:13,640
No. Oh.

1383
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:16,200
What the fuck?

1384
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:17,760
Beetlejuice in the house.

1385
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:20,960
This is your brains
on drugs. Hee!

1386
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,800
Oof.

1387
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,160
Oh, shit, son.

1388
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:27,200
Aah!

1389
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:29,240
Oh.

1390
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:33,640
Shorty!

1391
01:03:33,675 --> 01:03:35,000
Got me.

1392
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:36,920
Cindy, what's going on?

1393
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:38,840
It's Hanson.
He's possessed.

1394
01:03:38,875 --> 01:03:39,920
Let's get him.

1395
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:16,960
Whoo!

1396
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,480
Ahh.

1397
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:19,600
Angel style!

1398
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:24,560
Hi-yah!

1399
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:25,760
Aah!

1400
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:28,240
Smack my bitch up

1401
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:29,440
Aah!

1402
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:34,480
Uh!

1403
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:46,320
Whoo! OK.

1404
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:48,560
Boo!

1405
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:49,560
Come on.

1406
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:50,880
Aah!

1407
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:51,840
- Oh!
- Aah!

1408
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:53,200
Smack my bitch up

1409
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:54,640
Aah!

1410
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,400
OK.

1411
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:10,480
Aaaaaaah...

1412
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:12,520
Oh, nooo!

1413
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:14,200
Oh!

1414
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:16,320
Ohh.

1415
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:18,640
Hee, hee, hee! Ooh!

1416
01:05:18,675 --> 01:05:20,120
Aah!

1417
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:27,200
Hi-yi!

1418
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,240
Aah!

1419
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:34,780
Aah!

1420
01:05:34,815 --> 01:05:36,440
Whoo!

1421
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:41,520
Whoo! Oh! Ooh!

1422
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:54,680
Ooh!

1423
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:17,600
Ow.

1424
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:18,560
Shit.

1425
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:25,760
Ahh!

1426
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:27,720
You OK, Dwight?

1427
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:30,680
I--I can't feel my legs.

1428
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:35,560
Aah!
I can't feel my legs!

1429
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:36,880
You never could.

1430
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:38,280
You stay out of this,
all right?

1431
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:39,680
Now listen.

1432
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:41,440
You get the others
and meet us upstairs.

1433
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:42,400
- All right?
- OK.

1434
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:43,560
You stay here.

1435
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:46,240
Ray-Ray, I need your help.
Give me your belt.

1436
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:47,240
- Hi-yah!
- Hah!

1437
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:48,560
Heee!

1438
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:50,480
Hmmm. The crane.

1439
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:53,960
Ha!

1440
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:57,280
The crouching tiger.

1441
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:03,800
The drunken monkey.

1442
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:06,000
Ooh, ooh, ooh
ah, ah, ah!

1443
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:08,640
The mad cow.

1444
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:14,520
Motherfucker! Moo!

1445
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:15,960
Aah!

1446
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,520
The camel toe.

1447
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:20,760
Yow-hi!

1448
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:41,080
Get the hell
out of there, guys!

1449
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:42,160
Come on!

1450
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:49,960
Ray, give me a 180.

1451
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,880
OK. Listen.
Someone has to go...

1452
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:54,400
and lure him
onto that platform.

1453
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:00,480
All right. I'll go.

1454
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:01,440
Cindy, let me--

1455
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:03,040
No, Buddy!

1456
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:04,400
I'm the one he wants.

1457
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:06,080
Actually, I was saying...

1458
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:08,040
let me have your computer
if you die.

1459
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:10,080
Oh.

1460
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:11,280
OK. But as soon as
he gets there...

1461
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:12,600
you have to get off.

1462
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:14,200
OK.

1463
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:15,440
All right. 180 me.

1464
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:19,280
Hugh Kane, it's me you want!

1465
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:20,720
Come get me!

1466
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:23,160
I'm not afraid anymore!

1467
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:24,800
Show yourself!

1468
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:29,160
Aah! Oh!

1469
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:34,360
Aah!

1470
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:37,600
Ooh.

1471
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:46,525
Dwight, he's here.
Do something.

1472
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:48,040
I can't.
She's still on the platform.

1473
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:49,560
If I throw the switch,
she'll die.

1474
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:50,920
Cindy, get out of there!
You'll get killed!

1475
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,400
Aah!

1476
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:53,680
Ha, ha, ha!

1477
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:54,760
Move out of the way!

1478
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:56,240
I'll get her!

1479
01:08:58,800 --> 01:08:59,960
Why is he running so slow?

1480
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,040
Ray! Run faster!

1481
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:03,005
OK!

1482
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:05,560
Throw the switch!

1483
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,560
Now you will be mine...
forever!

1484
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:21,600
Ray, you saved me.

1485
01:09:21,635 --> 01:09:22,840
Are you OK?

1486
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:23,805
I'm fine.

1487
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:25,400
I broke my fall.

1488
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:27,800
Ohh. Ah.

1489
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:42,320
Oh.

1490
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:44,720
- Yes!
- Yes!

1491
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:49,240
Hey, y'all.
What's going on?

1492
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:51,680
Shorty, you made it.
You're alive!

1493
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:58,800
Yeah.
It was traumatic.

1494
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:00,440
It really was...

1495
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:02,640
and it's taking me
a while to get over it,

1496
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:04,080
but, you know...

1497
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:07,400
now that we're out of the house
and back in school...

1498
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:09,480
I just know that
everything's gonna be OK.

1499
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:12,880
Oh, God,
will you shut the fuck up?

1500
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:15,280
Why couldn't you have
just left me there to die?

1501
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:17,320
Give me a fucking rope.
I'll hang myself.

1502
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:19,560
Here I go.
I'm hanging myself.

1503
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:23,640
Hello?

1504
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:25,525
Oh, hi, Dad.

1505
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:28,080
Are you having fun
on your vacation?

1506
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:30,280
Oh, no. Birds are
very clean animals.

1507
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:31,440
He's no trouble at all.

1508
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:32,480
Goddamn it!

1509
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:34,600
What the fuck
did you put in this birdseed?

1510
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:41,680
Oh, Dad, Buddy's here.
I got to go.

1511
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:42,720
OK. I love you. Bye.

1512
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:44,960
God, that was a big one.

1513
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,440
- Hey, Buddy!
- Surprise.

1514
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:48,720
Open chest!

1515
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:52,560
Oh! You got to be quicker
than that, pencil dick.

1516
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:54,160
Come on.

1517
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:57,360
Hey, look out. A bee.

1518
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:58,760
Buddy,
I've never had anyone...

1519
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:01,040
be so protective
of me before.

1520
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:02,480
That's what your man's
supposed to do.

1521
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:04,480
Two hot dogs.

1522
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:10,440
Buddy, get him!

1523
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:12,840
Buddy? Buddy?

1524
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:14,320
I've come back for you.

1525
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:15,920
No! This can't be happening!

1526
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:18,480
Mm-hmm.
It is happening.

1527
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:21,320
Now we're gonna be
together forever.

1528
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:23,240
Nooooo!

1529
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:29,040
Yes!

1530
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:33,000
Did you hear something?

1531
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:36,360
No. I didn't hear nothing.

1532
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:37,840

She kept it
coming, coming, coming

Hey, what's up, dog?

01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,480
This shit gets real deep

1594
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:02,520
About a week ago or so
when I saw you up in the spot

1595
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:04,000
With that chick that was hot

1596
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:05,320
But whatever

1597
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:06,560
To make a long story shorter

1598
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:08,000
She slipped me the number

1599
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:09,680
Though I really
didn't wanna, uh-uh

1600
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:11,640
And as the crowd
is my witness, believe me

1601
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:14,520
I was minding my own business
and she teased me, yeah

1602
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:16,680
She kept buying me
and following me, see

1603
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:19,040
And the fact she was exotic
wasn't making it easy

1604
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:20,320
She got close to me

1605
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:21,640
I'm like, "Lord forgive me"

1606
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:22,960
No one's around,
she went down

1607
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,600
Man, you get
the picture be

1608
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:26,880
It was hypnotic,
and she was so erotic

1609
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:28,240
I tried,
but I just couldn't stop it

1610
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:29,560
She kept it coming

1611
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:31,480
It was hypnotic
and so erotic

1612
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:33,440
I tried,
but I just couldn't stop it

1613
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:34,760
She kept it coming

1614
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:36,160
I was in a similar situation

1615
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:37,600
One of my boys once invited me

1616
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:39,480
With his family
on a Christmas vacation

1617
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:41,160
I went to Ross and bought
a present and everything

1618
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:42,520
- But I kept it
- Why?

1619
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:43,960
'Cause it looked dope on me

1620
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:46,000
They had a house
on the beach in Maui

1621
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:47,800
I had no idea that
they were that rich

1622
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:49,480
His mom was a fat bitch

1623
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:50,800
But his sister was hot

1624
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:52,160
I told myself not to touch it

1625
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:53,640
Even though I want to fuck it

1626
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:55,680
I have a history
of not listening to me

1627
01:14:55,720 --> 01:14:57,160
She walked out in a bikini

1628
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:59,240
Where no one could see me,
believe me

1629
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:01,360
- I tried real hard
- What happened?

1630
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:04,240
Then my dick got real hard

1631
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:06,400
It was hypnotic,
and she was so erotic

1632
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:07,840
I tried,
but I just couldn't stop it

1633
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:09,120
She kept it coming

1634
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:11,240
It was hypnotic
and so erotic

1635
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:12,760
I tried,
but I just couldn't stop it

1636
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,200
She kept it coming

1637
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:15,960
It was hypnotic,
and she was so erotic

1638
01:15:15,995 --> 01:15:17,640
I tried,
but I just couldn't stop it

1639
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:19,040
She kept it coming

1640
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:21,245
It was hypnotic
and so erotic

1641
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:22,840
I tried,
but I just couldn't stop it

1642
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:24,160
She kept it coming

1643
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:26,160
It was hypnotic
and so erotic

1644
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:27,560
I tried,
but I just couldn't stop it

1645
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:28,960
She kept it coming

1646
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,120
It was hypnotic,
she was so erotic

1647
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:32,600
I tried,
but I just couldn't stop it

1648
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:33,885
She kept it coming

1649
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:36,080
It was hypnotic
and so erotic

1650
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:37,440
I tried,
but I just couldn't stop it

1651
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:38,760
She kept it coming

1652
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:41,040
It was hypnotic
and so erotic

1653
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:42,640
I tried,
but I just couldn't stop it

1654
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:43,960
She kept it coming

1655
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
It was hypnotic
and so erotic

1656
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:47,840
I tried,
but I just couldn't stop it

1657
01:15:47,875 --> 01:15:49,640
She kept it coming

1658
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:55,160
She kept it coming

1659
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:09,360
Ooh, when it's dark outside

1660
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:13,880
All my fears arise

1661
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:18,600
When it's dark outside

1662
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:21,800
All my fears

1663
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:26,520
Sun's gone down,
the light's all gone

1664
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:30,920
Big-ass house
and we're alone

1665
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:33,160
I hear voices,
what I'm-a do?

1666
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:35,480
Hear those noises,
what I'm-a do?

1667
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:38,200
What's my choice here,
run like a fool?

1668
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:40,760
I'm long gone

1669
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:42,720
- Shh.
- What's that sound?

1670
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:45,080
Everybody look
what's floating round

1671
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:47,000
Not too sure of what I see

1672
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:49,520
All I know is it's scaring me

1673
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:55,840
Ooh, when it's dark outside

1674
01:16:55,880 --> 01:17:00,400
All my fears arise

1675
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:05,120
When it's dark outside

1676
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:08,440
All my fears

1677
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:10,720
And just when
you think it's over

1678
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:15,360
Some new sound
is coming towards me

1679
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:17,360
Getting loud

1680
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:19,680
I hear noises,
where I'm-a go?

1681
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:22,080
Hear those voices,
head for the door

1682
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:24,680
What's my plan?
Don't know anymore

1683
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:27,360
Something's wrong

1684
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:29,040
- Shh.
- What's that sound?

1685
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:31,880
Everybody look
what's going down

1686
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:33,800
And why won't you let me be?

1687
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:36,160
Go right now,
you're scaring me

1688
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:42,440
Ooh, when it's dark outside

1689
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:47,000
All my fears arise

1690
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:51,640
When it's dark outside

1691
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:54,800
All my fears

1692
01:17:54,840 --> 01:18:01,120
Ooh, when it's dark outside

1693
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:05,680
All my fears arise

1694
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:10,320
When it's dark outside

1695
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:14,480
All my fears

1696
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:16,160
Here's something,
so get back

1697
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:18,560
Shorty looking at me like,
"Yo, let me hit that"

1698
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:20,600
Footsteps in the dark,
whatcha gone do?

1699
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:21,640
I was talking
to this chicken

1700
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:23,040
Oh. Shit.

1701
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:24,080
Is this a poltergeist
or a heist?

1702
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:25,440
She robs some

1703
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:26,600
All the jewels,
murdering tools

1704
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:27,600
We got some

1705
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:28,640
Like cha-cha

1706
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:29,840
Ready to open up shop

1707
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:30,920
Wreak havoc on the block

1708
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:32,000
Now love it, don't stop

1709
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:33,320
Come on

1710
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:38,800
Ooh, when it's dark outside

1711
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:42,120
All my fears arise

1712
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:48,240
Ooh, when it's dark outside

1713
01:18:48,275 --> 01:18:52,760
All my fears arise

1714
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:56,500
When it's dark outside.

1715
01:18:56,700 --> 01:18:59,000
