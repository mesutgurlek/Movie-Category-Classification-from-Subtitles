1
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,270
There was nothing special
about Somerset County.

2
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:18,310
It was a deeply ordinary place.

3
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:22,180
No astonishing thing
ever happened there.

4
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,680
The people who lived there
were just regular people.

5
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:30,780
And the animals...
Well, they were just plain old animals.

6
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:34,790
They didn't question the order of things.

7
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,930
So, the days passed,
one very much like the other.

8
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:43,210
But, one spring, on a small farm,

9
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:47,030
a little girl did something,

10
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,720
something that
would change everything.

11
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,920
What are you doing?

12
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,310
Fern, go back to bed.

13
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:38,380
You're not going to kill it, are you?

14
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,450
It's a runt. Now, go back to bed.

15
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:44,350
No, it's not fair!
It can't help being born small.

16
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:45,450
Careful.

17
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,560
If I'd been born small,
would you have killed me?

18
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,000
Of course not.

19
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:55,560
A little girl is one thing.
A runty pig is another.

20
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:00,360
There's no difference!
This is unfair and unjust.

21
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,540
How could you be so heartless?

22
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,910
Come here.
I want to show you something.

23
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,150
You see that? You see?

24
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,910
There's 11 pigs and only 10 teats.

25
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:13,470
Sow can't feed it, honey.

26
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,360
Then I will.

27
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:26,820
I'll feed you and take care of you and...

28
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,300
...absolutely will not let you kill him.

29
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,150
- Hey! When did Fern get a pig?
- Avery, it's rude to point. Give me that.

30
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:55,020
Come, sit, eat your breakfast.
The bus will be here any minute.

31
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,300
Good morning.

32
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,690
Hey, Pop, can I have a pig, too?

33
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:01,660
No. I only give pigs to early risers.

34
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:06,870
Fern was up before dawn,
ridding the world of injustice.

35
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:09,600
Fern, put that pig down
and get to school.

36
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,700
Avery.

37
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,140
- See ya.
- Bye, Pop.

38
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,460
Have a good one, buddy.

39
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,980
Says here we're gonna get
a lot of rain this month.

40
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,470
Fern! Your books!

41
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:32,690
Bye.

42
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:35,730
Class, these are some of the questions

43
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:40,600
that you're likely to be asked
in the exam this week.

44
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:45,000
So, please take particular note
of every one.

45
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:51,180
You got to be quiet, okay?
You're gonna get me in trouble.

46
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,300
Drink that.

47
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,820
So, it's just a matter of
following these questions

48
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,220
and learning the answers.

49
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,690
Fern, what's going on?

50
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:07,790
Nothing.

51
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:12,570
Fern, what's in your desk?

52
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,910
- Nothing.
- Open it.

53
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,460
Thank you, Mrs. Arable.

54
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:33,710
Fern, you know better.

55
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:38,190
It's a pig, okay?
It's not a toy, not a doll, not a baby.

56
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,290
A pig.

57
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:44,150
And you need to start
treating it like one.

58
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,210
This is going too far.

59
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,450
I know she loves animals,
but you have to tell her.

60
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:06,330
- I know. She's just so happy with it.
- I know.

61
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,000
Doesn't that feel good?

62
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,430
Fern, I'm really sorry, honey,
but it's been long enough.

63
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:19,530
What?

64
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,440
Look, he's not a baby anymore.

65
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:24,770
I can't have you keeping what will soon
be a 300-pound pet around the house.

66
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,870
No.

67
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:30,390
Can't he stay in the barn? Please, Dad?

68
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,910
- No.
- Please?

69
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:34,050
No. Fern, look.
You know I've been selling the animals

70
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:36,520
to get the new harvesting equipment.

71
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:40,220
Pretty soon there's gonna be
no place in the barn for a pig.

72
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,190
I promised I'd take care of him.

73
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:44,790
Well, I'm letting you
out of your promise.

74
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:48,710
I didn't promise you. I promised Wilbur.

75
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,840
What about Homer?

76
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,890
He has animals.

77
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:54,870
Uncle Homer?

78
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:59,990
I'm sure he could make room for a pig.

79
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:05,610
Yeah.

80
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,890
He'd be right across the road.

81
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,940
Go to sleep, my little one

82
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:30,030
The sun has said goodbye for now

83
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:36,420
The moon shines on your beautiful face

84
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:45,850
My mom used to sing that to me
to make me feel safe.

85
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:46,970
Good night,

86
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:50,690
Wilbur.

87
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:04,040
Fern had walked across the road to her
uncle's barn hundreds of times before,

88
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,170
but it had never felt so far away.

89
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:12,140
It was just a big red barn
full of typical stuff.

90
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,090
Come to think of it,
it couldn't have been more ordinary.

91
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:21,760
But sometimes,
when you take two ordinary things

92
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,590
and put them together
at just the right time,

93
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:29,130
there's a chance they'll become
two less ordinary things.

94
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:33,670
That runty pig, for instance,
and that big old smelly barn.

95
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:37,970
One sniff, and you knew it was a place
full of living things.

96
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:41,010
But that didn't necessarily mean
it was full of life.

97
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,510
It's okay. It's okay.

98
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:45,210
Nope. For that, this barn needed a pig.

99
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,130
This isn't so bad.

100
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,120
Only no one knew it yet.

101
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,800
Don't be afraid.

102
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,420
You'll be okay.

103
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,600
I'll come see you every day.

104
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:09,240
I'll be around so much
you'll be sick of me.

105
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,440
I love you.

106
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,340
Avery, the bus is here!

107
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:37,460
- Did you remember your sister's lunch?
- Got it!

108
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:03,820
What the hay?

109
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,730
- What's he doing?
- Probably-obably something smart.

110
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,330
- Pigs are smart.
- Pigs are not smart!

111
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:12,830
Apparently, they're as intelligent
as dolphins.

112
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,510
Advantage dolphin.

113
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,440
- He's going to knock himself out.
- Yeah! That's using your head!

114
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:21,360
How many times is he going to try that?

115
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,880
- Pig's out!
- I told you pigs are smart.

116
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,810
That's going to leave a mark.

117
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:29,880
- Oh, look, Bits. Pig's out.
- Sure is out.

118
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,560
Out of his mind!

119
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,920
Homer!

120
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,860
Lurvy!

121
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,630
- Pig's out!
- Pig's out, pig's out, pig's out!

122
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:45,700
- How about you walk a little faster?
- Wait your turn!

123
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,420
Wait! Wait! Fern, come back!

124
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,640
Just run!

125
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,440
Run, pig! Be free! I would if I could.

126
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,540
Retreat!

127
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,940
- Retreat!
- Don't retreat, pig! Giddyup!

128
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:03,230
- Oh, no! Not the smokehouse!
- No! Not the smokehouse!

129
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,120
- Is he looking?
- Yeah, he's seen it.

130
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,960
- Think he knows what it is?
- Of course not.

131
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:13,440
He's a spring pig.
He doesn't know anything.

132
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:15,490
Here, pig, pig, pig!

133
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:21,850
Don't fall for it. You're out.

134
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,240
And you're back in.

135
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,160
Here you go, piggy.

136
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,610
Attaboy. Eat it up.

137
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:32,810
Sold out for slop.
I'd have been to the county line by now.

138
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,950
He'd have made it
if you'd have just let me talk.

139
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:37,920
- Made it to where? He's a pig!
- He's a pig.

140
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:42,060
Sorry I made such a fuss.
Your suggestions were really good,

141
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,890
but I think I'd better stay here.
Fern's going to be back soon, anyway.

142
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:48,500
He's just stupid as a stick, poor thing.

143
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,700
- Should we speak to him?
- Certainly not!

144
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,830
Certainly not.

145
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:54,630
Sweetheart, it sounded-ounded
almost like you said

146
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,570
you'd run and be free if you could.

147
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:59,130
I meant if I were a pig.

148
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:01,440
You know what happens to pigs
around here.

149
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:06,480
Yes, I do.
And it should never, ever be spoken of.

150
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,530
I'm gonna miss you today.

151
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:21,570
See you when I get back, okay?

152
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,340
All right, I gotta go, okay? See you later.

153
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:34,810
Bye.

154
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,140
Goodbye, Fern. Hurry back.

155
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:58,730
Hi.

156
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,960
My name's Wilbur.

157
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,270
Anyone want to play?

158
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,740
Anyone?

159
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:09,710
It's raining, you know.
And you know what you get with rain?

160
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:11,110
- Lightning.
- Typhoons.

161
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:12,510
- Cholera.
- Dysentery.

162
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:14,250
- Frizzy hair.
- That sad feeling.

163
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,350
No, mud!

164
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:18,250
What the heck is he doing now?

165
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:20,520
Hey, come on. You wanna join me?
Come on! Let's go!

166
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,190
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

167
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:25,430
Let's not.
How many times must I tell you?

168
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:29,460
Just because we're sheep,
it doesn't mean we have to follow.

169
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,160
Think for yourselves.

170
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,230
- Yourselves. Quite right!
- Look at me!

171
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:35,590
- No, no, no. Yourselves.
- Myself?

172
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:39,510
Hey, kid, this is a barn.
We don't play, we work.

173
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,570
- Some of us, anyway.
- "Some of us"?

174
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,640
Are you implying, Ike,
that we don't work?

175
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:48,380
Because we work bloody hard,
thank you!

176
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,380
Hard? You grow hair!

177
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,890
"Grow hair." Good one!

178
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:54,990
Excuse me.

179
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:59,530
And is that your contribution to society,
you gassy rib eyes?

180
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,050
Filthy hairball!

181
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:03,400
- Rib eyes!
- Dirty lintball!

182
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,500
Zip it.

183
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,770
- They're at it again.
- Rib eyes! Rib eyes!

184
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:08,570
It's really slippery. That's the fun part!

185
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:13,210
Little itty-bitty pig,
could you come here, please?

186
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:15,380
You said your name is Wilbur, right?

187
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,240
That's right. What's your name?

188
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,880
- Gussy.
- Gussy?

189
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,210
- Great name!
- Thank you, Wilbur.

190
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,950
Now, you're so cute and pink,
but you're wasting your time.

191
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,290
These animals won't play.

192
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,050
- What about you?
- Me?

193
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,660
Well, I have to stay on my eggs.

194
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,900
Oh, wow! Look at that!

195
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:35,500
Otherwise, of course, I'd love to play.

196
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,530
So, why can't you play?

197
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:41,230
Because what's good for the goose
is good for the gander.

198
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,040
What about the rest of you?
Don't any of you like to play?

199
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,110
Can't play on three empty stomachs.

200
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:50,780
Well, for us there's this whole
smell-of-wet-wool business. Ghastly!

201
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,180
See? I'm afraid
it's just not a play kind of place.

202
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,850
But you're all friends, right?

203
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:58,480
Sure. We've been here together
our whole lives.

204
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:05,450
I'm not so sure being in the same place
is the same as being friends.

205
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:12,270
I'm not hungry.
I just wanted someone to play with me.

206
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:13,550
What's that?

207
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,340
What is...

208
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,320
Could it be?

209
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,980
Slops!

210
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,710
Oh, joy. It seems the pig slop
has brought out the rodent.

211
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:28,950
Moldy cheese. Oh, yeah.

212
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,570
Did I have salami last night?

213
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,360
Yep. I guess I did.

214
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,290
- Oh, charming.
- Disgusting creature!

215
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,400
Hi, there.

216
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,970
Oh, you're a pig.

217
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,370
You're a pig.

218
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,600
Pig equals slop.

219
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,200
The rat is happy.

220
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,140
My name's Wilbur.

221
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,700
Do you have a name?
Or is it just "the rat"?

222
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,740
Did you say "just the rat"?

223
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:10,320
For your information, pig, the rat rules.

224
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:14,530
We were here long before your kind,
and we'll be here long after.

225
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,200
So, you just keep that in mind

226
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,630
next time you feel like
reducing me to "just the rat."

227
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,700
You called yourself "the rat."

228
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,820
I can call me that. You can't.

229
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,680
So you don't have a name?

230
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,110
Of course I do. It's Templeton.

231
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:33,080
Templeton? Great name!

232
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:36,380
- Oh, gee, thanks.
- Hey! You want to play, Templeton?

233
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,780
For so many reasons, no.

234
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,570
See, I don't play.

235
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:46,860
I gnaw, I spy, I eat, I hide.
Me in a nutshell.

236
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,800
Couldn't you just stay and chat?

237
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,560
Chat? Let me see.

238
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:53,110
Gnaw, spy, eat, hide.

239
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:57,390
Nope, "chat" ain't on the list.

240
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,280
The rat is handsome.

241
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,670
Tonight I dream of slop!

242
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:44,050
Fern, you are not going to see
that pig again. It's too late.

243
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:45,790
But he's expecting me!

244
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:49,160
And I'm expecting you to finish
your homework and go straight to bed.

245
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,790
But, Mom, I always tell him good night!

246
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:56,190
- Not tonight.
- He can't sleep if I don't.

247
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,620
Good night.

248
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:00,650
Good night.

249
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:03,590
Good night!

250
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,860
Good night.

251
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,790
Huh? Who said that?

252
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,320
Who are you?

253
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:13,610
Where are you? Are you invisible?

254
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,450
No, I'm nocturnal,

255
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:18,850
which means I work at night,
when you should be sleeping.

256
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:22,690
Now, I need to concentrate,
so, good night.

257
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:26,790
But I can't sleep now!
Please, tell me who you are.

258
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:29,110
I'm just really lonely.

259
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,800
So I've seen.

260
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:35,200
Look, you seem like a very nice pig,
so I'll tell you what.

261
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,740
If you go to sleep right now
and let me work,

262
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,810
we can converse tomorrow.

263
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:43,480
- Converse?
- I think your word was "chat."

264
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,560
Oh. Great! All right.

265
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:49,570
Good night. Good night. Good night.

266
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,310
Good night.

267
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,900
Okay, he still hasn't moved.

268
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:09,810
We've been here one, wait, two...

269
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,540
We've been here a long time, Elwyn,
and that guy ain't moving!

270
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,910
He's like a freak of nature.

271
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:19,710
I'm dying, man.
I've got to get some corn!

272
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:22,990
I know, Brooksie. Just be patient.

273
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,020
Come on.

274
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,220
Come on.

275
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,280
Just a little further.

276
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:38,050
Okay, it's morning!

277
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:41,230
- Hey, Bits, I wasn't drooling, was I?
- Suck it up, Bets.

278
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,570
Would whoever addressed me last night
kindly make yourself known?

279
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:48,980
What luck! An early riser,
and he has things he needs to say.

280
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,740
Yeah, loud things.

281
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:53,950
I'm speaking to whoever spoke to me
last night.

282
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:56,350
I suppose that would be me.

283
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:57,450
Okay.

284
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:01,820
- I can't see you.
- Up here, in the corner.

285
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,500
The other corner.

286
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,890
I'm sorry. I still can't see you.

287
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:11,570
Move a little closer. I'll come down.

288
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,340
Hi. You're a...

289
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:28,450
Look, I've got a long day ahead of me
and I'm trying to get a little...

290
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:30,320
Spider! Spider! Get it away from me!

291
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,880
Get it away! Get it away!

292
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,920
All right, keep your distance there.

293
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:38,860
- That thing is creepy.
- Golly! You're not being rude, are you?

294
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,200
No, no, no. I meant "creepy"
in a nice way. You know, creepy good.

295
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,300
Disgusting!

296
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,770
- They eat their menfolk, you know.
- I know!

297
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:50,070
Well? Still want to chat,
or are you gonna join them?

298
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:53,190
I've never met a spider before.

299
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:55,110
Did you make that?

300
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:57,780
Is that what you were concentrating on
last night?

301
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,020
- Yes.
- It's amazing.

302
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:06,320
Think you could teach me
how to make one of those?

303
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,100
Hold that thought, please.

304
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,760
- What are you doing?
- Making breakfast.

305
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,680
- Oh, boy.
- Relax.

306
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:20,200
First, I give him a little nip
to anesthetize him,

307
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,870
so he'll be more comfortable.

308
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:23,740
It's a little service I throw in.

309
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,700
Then I wrap him up.

310
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:29,780
Then I just say grace because,
well, that's always nice,

311
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,440
and he'll make a
perfectly delicious meal.

312
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,280
So, you eat flies?

313
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,680
No, no, no.

314
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,150
I drink their blood.

315
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:43,860
- Lying down on the job, eh?
- Fainted like a girl.

316
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,490
That's disgusting.

317
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,990
Well, that's easy for you to say.

318
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:51,200
You have all your meals
brought to you in a pail.

319
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,230
I don't get that kind of royal treatment.

320
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,770
I am a trapper.

321
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:58,670
I have to catch my food.
Which is why I make my home near you.

322
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:04,110
- Please don't hurt me.
- Well, since you said "please."

323
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:07,150
And just imagine how many bugs
there would be in this barn,

324
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,550
no, actually, in the world,

325
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:11,380
if spiders didn't catch them.

326
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,250
Insects would take over the planet!

327
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:16,090
The way I see it,
I'm doing everyone a favor.

328
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:18,010
Except for the fly.

329
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:22,090
Yes. Except for the fly.

330
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:29,700
I think now is the time
for me to say salutations.

331
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,800
What?

332
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,160
Salutations.

333
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:35,330
Okay. I'll leave.

334
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:36,960
No, Wilbur.

335
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:41,710
"Salutations" is just a fancy way
of saying hello.

336
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:42,810
Oh! Hello.

337
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:48,190
Hey, you know my name! What's yours?

338
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:49,290
My name?

339
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:53,390
My name is Charlotte.
Charlotte A. Cavatica.

340
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:55,470
Charlotte. Great name!

341
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:59,160
Thank you. I've always thought so.

342
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:01,650
Hey, since you've said...

343
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:04,700
You know, that word,

344
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,580
does that mean we're friends?

345
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,740
I suppose it does.

346
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,840
Yeah!

347
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:17,320
Golly, go see what's going-oing on
over there.

348
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:21,450
What's going-oing...
Hey, kid, what's going on over here?

349
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:24,920
Oh, sorry.
I just made a new friend, that's all.

350
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:28,200
The spider. Oh, yeah. Good choice.

351
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:29,950
Yeah, perfect.

352
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:34,600
You picked someone
even more despised than me.

353
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,440
Why would anyone despise Charlotte?

354
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:41,440
She made that amazing web,
and she keeps bugs out of the barn.

355
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:44,810
Look at her.
I mean, don't you think she's a little...

356
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:46,490
What's the word?

357
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:51,450
I think she's beautiful.

358
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:55,290
I beg your pardon. She is hideous!

359
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:58,990
Are we even seeing
the same ruddy creature?

360
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:00,270
I guess not.

361
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,500
Hopeless.

362
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:12,430
What a sorry little friendship
that's going to be.

363
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:16,840
There's an old expression that says
that ignorance is bliss,

364
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:19,910
and I'm inclined to believe it's true,

365
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:21,810
because, on that late spring day,

366
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:25,580
Wilbur was as happy as a pig could be.

367
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,950
And those spring days
rolled into summer days,

368
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,920
days filled with endless conversation

369
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:34,760
between the two unlikeliest of friends.

370
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,160
Charlotte, what's a spring pig?

371
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,160
A pig who was born in the spring.

372
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:41,670
Oh. And I thought it meant bouncy.

373
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:44,470
That would be a springy pig.

374
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,210
"After Mrs. Mallard had laid eight eggs
in the nest,

375
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:50,410
"she couldn't go to visit
Michael anymore,

376
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:53,180
"because she had to sit on the eggs
to keep them warm.

377
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:57,350
"She moved off the nest only to get
a drink of water, or to have her lunch,

378
00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:00,750
"or to count the eggs
and make sure they were all there.

379
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:05,360
"One day, the ducklings hatched out.
First came Jack, then Kack..."

380
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,160
Yeah! Yeah! This is going to be great!

381
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:11,400
- Wilbur, what on earth are you doing?
- You'll see.

382
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,400
That feels marvelous!

383
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:16,100
Yes, over to the left a bit. Ah, yes.

384
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,970
Is that a breeze I feel?
I'm 10 pounds lighter!

385
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:21,170
- I'm next!
- I'm next!

386
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,840
- I'm next!
- I'm next, too!

387
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:25,780
- Looking pretty good, huh?
- Sure is.

388
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,350
Hi, there. Are you new to the barn?
I'm Wilbur.

389
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:31,030
Wilbur, it's me.

390
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:32,570
Me? Great name!

391
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:35,910
No, me. Me! Samuel! The sheep!

392
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:39,150
Wow! What happened to you?

393
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,660
The world's first pig web! Ta-da!

394
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,770
I think you'd better
leave the web-spinning to me.

395
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:53,670
After weeks and weeks,

396
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:58,580
and I'm talking about some long weeks
of waiting and expecting,

397
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:02,420
all the hard work has finally paid off.

398
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,350
Wow! Look at them! They were eggs,

399
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:08,890
and now they're... They're just...
Look at them!

400
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:11,490
Wow, Gussy,
you did a really terrific job!

401
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,560
They don't call me Mother Goose
for nothing.

402
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,000
Congratulations.

403
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,810
Would you look at that!

404
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,170
Yes, thank you, thank you!

405
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:22,170
It wasn't easy, but I managed.

406
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:23,370
You managed?

407
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:27,210
I'm kidding, honey. We managed.

408
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:31,080
Six, seven. Weren't there eight eggs?

409
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:33,160
Could this be a dud?

410
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,160
Golly! Golly!

411
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,320
- Golly!
- Whoa!

412
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:40,950
Whoa, there, Father Goose!
I'm just trying to help the happy couple.

413
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:43,150
What do you want
with a rotten egg, anyway?

414
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,160
I want a rotten egg

415
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:49,230
for the simple reason that...
You never know.

416
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:50,900
This one didn't make it.

417
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,940
I think we have to let it go.

418
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,580
Oh, take it!

419
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:59,970
And add it
to that nasty-asty collection of yours.

420
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:02,930
Last one out is a rotten egg!

421
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,940
- Well, I thought it was funny.
- I should have pecked him!

422
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:07,610
Don't you break that egg, rat.

423
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:10,380
A broken rotten egg would make
this barn stink to high heaven.

424
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,700
That would be a change.

425
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:15,690
Why are you laughing, Bits?
He just said we stink.

426
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:20,490
Oh, yeah. This is good.
This will come in handy.

427
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,220
You really are a handsome devil.

428
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:29,030
Oh, boy.

429
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,540
Egg-xactly!

430
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:04,400
Saw a big old spider in the doorway!
Gonna go catch it!

431
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,440
No, Avery! Come back here!

432
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:10,680
- Here, spidey-spidey.
- You can't do that!

433
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:11,910
Stop!

434
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:18,110
- Gotcha!
- No, no, Avery!

435
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,980
Wilbur, no! Come on, Wilbur, get off!

436
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:25,570
Wilbur, Wilbur, why did you do that?

437
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:26,790
Avery! No!

438
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,200
That stinks!

439
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,780
Oh, that is gross.

440
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,850
Man, is that you?

441
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:51,950
No. I smell a smell, though.
Think it's scary guy?

442
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:56,910
- He's trying to stink us away from the...
- Corn!

443
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:01,690
Guess the yolk's on me.

444
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,060
That is one ripe egg.

445
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:09,550
That stinks good!

446
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:12,310
That is disgusting!

447
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:17,410
- We told you not to break that egg.
- Now look what you've done, rat!

448
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:19,280
It saved Charlotte, didn't it?

449
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:23,350
Yeah, ingrates.
I saved the leggy lady's life.

450
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:26,050
- You mean that as a good thing, right?
- Of course.

451
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:28,050
I do have a few eyes, you know,

452
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:30,290
and I think
Wilbur did most of the saving.

453
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:32,420
I know. Ironic, isn't it?

454
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:36,630
He's saving you,
and they're saving him for Christmas.

455
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:37,730
Templeton!

456
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,480
What's Christmas?

457
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:43,070
The day you'll be cured.

458
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:44,910
But I'm not sick.

459
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,870
I didn't say you were sick.

460
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:50,140
- Uh-oh. That was a mistake.
- Yep. Typical rat.

461
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,710
What? You're going to lie
to the future football here? Okay.

462
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:58,680
But it's a sad statement when
I'm the most honest guy in the place.

463
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:01,150
Templeton, what are you talking about?

464
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:03,520
Come winter,
the farmer will be checking you

465
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:06,400
into the old smokehouse hotel.

466
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:12,700
And the only checking out that happens
is when people gather around and say,

467
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,070
"Check out that yummy sausage.

468
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:18,110
"Check out that sizzling bacon."

469
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:23,910
So, that's what that is for.

470
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:26,710
Ain't for roasting chestnuts.

471
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:31,040
He wouldn't. Humans love pigs.

472
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:34,000
Well, they love pork.

473
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:39,290
Well, this is awkward, isn't it?

474
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:40,390
Charlotte!

475
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:43,290
Charlotte, is it true?

476
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:47,170
Wilbur, few spring pigs get to see
the snows of winter.

477
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:50,030
No! I can't believe this. I won't believe it.

478
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:52,170
- Oh, Wilbur.
- It isn't fair!

479
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:56,610
- I want to live! I want to see the snow!
- And you will.

480
00:31:56,710 --> 00:32:00,880
I'm making you a promise right now.
I am not going to let them kill you.

481
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:03,680
You're a spider. You're little.
They're huge!

482
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,720
How are you going to stop them?

483
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:08,090
I have no idea. But it's a promise,

484
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:11,460
and promises are something
I never break.

485
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,860
Just don't you worry about it, Wilbur.

486
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:18,020
Besides, it's a long time
until Christmas.

487
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:21,400
Okay, Charlotte. If you say so.

488
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,480
- Dad?
- Yeah.

489
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,210
Can I walk home? I promised Wilbur
I'd be there right away.

490
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,120
- Sure. That's fine with me.
- Thanks.

491
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,240
Fern, wait!

492
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:44,590
Why don't you go to the Whites'
or the Sergeants' today and play?

493
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:47,330
- Or you could have someone over.
- Why?

494
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:49,830
Because you're spending too much time
in that barn.

495
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:52,400
It isn't good for you
to be alone so much.

496
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,670
Alone? All my best friends are there.

497
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:57,470
- Except the rat.
- The rat?

498
00:32:57,570 --> 00:33:00,040
I wouldn't call him my friend,
but the rest of them are.

499
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:02,310
They tell the greatest stories.
They make me laugh.

500
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:07,480
And I promised them I'd read 'em
this book, so I got to go. Bye!

501
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:10,850
Dr. Dorian, it's ridiculous, isn't it?

502
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:14,420
To think that animals can actually talk?

503
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,920
I don't know. Maybe an animal said
something to me and I didn't hear it

504
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:20,660
because I wasn't paying attention.

505
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:25,780
Maybe children are just better listeners
than we are.

506
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:28,770
Well, it worries me to no end.

507
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:33,940
What's got you worried is that her only
friends are pigs, sheep, geese and rats.

508
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,460
Well, not rats.

509
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,540
No.

510
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,710
- Does she look well?
- Yes.

511
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:41,310
Appetite's good?

512
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,080
- Does she sleep well at night?
- Yes.

513
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:46,720
I mean, she's right as rain in that way.

514
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:50,640
Well, there is a name for her condition.

515
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:54,520
It's called a childhood phase.

516
00:33:55,590 --> 00:34:00,130
And, sadly,
it's something she'll grow out of.

517
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:08,810
Charlotte, what are you doing?

518
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:09,910
Thinking.

519
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,240
I do my best thinking upside down.

520
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,880
Blood goes to my head
and perks me up.

521
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:19,350
I've been thinking, too, you know,
about Christmas.

522
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:24,070
Don't worry, Wilbur.
We'll figure something out.

523
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,600
Come on, Ike. Come on.

524
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,270
Not to be too much trouble,

525
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:44,380
but have you figured something out?

526
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,150
Not yet, but it's like a web.

527
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:52,030
You make it, you wait,
and something always comes.

528
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,950
Good night, Charlotte.

529
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,790
Good night, Wilbur.

530
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,420
And swing.

531
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,400
And stick.

532
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,400
And loop.

533
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,880
And back up, stick, and...

534
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,660
Mr. Zuckerman!

535
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:52,230
Okay, you gotta come see this.

536
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:02,030
Come on, Homer!

537
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:03,780
Come on!

538
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:52,860
- What's a "so me pig"?
- It's "some pig."

539
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,460
It's a miracle.

540
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:58,930
It's nothing short of a bona fide miracle.

541
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,380
Minister Beecher?

542
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,760
Homer. Edith.

543
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,900
What brings you here?

544
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:13,250
Divinity?

545
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:16,830
We think so.

546
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:36,670
We'd better keep this quiet
until I address it in my sermon.

547
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,510
You can't tell a soul,
but you gotta come up to the barn.

548
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:39,640
Keep it between me and you.

549
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:43,250
- Swing by the farm.
- Okay. Goodbye.

550
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,300
Now, don't tell nobody.
Shouldn't get around.

551
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:59,960
There's a word in a spider web
at Zuckerman's barn.

552
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:21,750
Charlotte, what does a "some pig" do?

553
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:25,360
This isn't for what you do.
It's for what you are.

554
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:28,160
Some pigs might smile a bit.

555
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:38,550
The lifting of the head, nice touch!

556
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:02,190
As ugly as that spider is,
we should have known she was smart.

557
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:05,260
So, you don't believe that someone
might be smart and pretty?

558
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,570
No. Yes! I mean, yes, because you are.

559
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:10,630
Clever little spider, isn't she?

560
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:13,140
Where's the spider who did this?

561
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:17,860
Well, we looked all over
and couldn't find one.

562
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:24,250
Looks pretty good.

563
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:26,950
Still ain't gonna change anything.
He's a goner.

564
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:29,670
Yeah. Glad nobody eats cows.

565
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:37,620
- Got to admit, that's a fine-looking pig.
- Yep, that's some pig, all right.

566
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:46,940
After a few weeks,
the phenomenon of the web wore off.

567
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,940
Nobody cared anymore,

568
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:55,750
and what was amazing yesterday
was suddenly ordinary again today.

569
00:40:55,850 --> 00:41:00,790
It looked like
Wilbur might not see snow after all.

570
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,020
Excuse me, but why are we here?

571
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:09,560
I mean, yes, barn meeting and so on
and so forth. I understand that.

572
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:14,200
But must this concern us?
And at such an ungodly hour!

573
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,070
You know, Wilbur's not the only one

574
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:20,170
who could end up being Christmas
dinner with an apple in his mouth.

575
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:22,470
Good point. Yes. Carry on, then.

576
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:25,210
Ike, this involves every one of us.

577
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:29,650
I just have trouble looking at you.
That's all.

578
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:31,720
This isn't about me. It's about Wilbur.

579
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:36,720
And, for the record, my view of you
is not exactly a treat, either.

580
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:40,060
As we have all seen,
humans have very short attention spans,

581
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,590
and there's just too much time
between now and Christmas.

582
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:45,460
Certainly enough time for
Zuckerman to find his affection for a pig

583
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,160
losing out to his hunger for ham.

584
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:49,600
- That spider can talk!
- Yeah.

585
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,140
What did she say, exactly?

586
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:55,240
She said the farmer might possibly
still slaughter the pig.

587
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:58,910
Sorry, old chap,
but it is a common fate for your ilk.

588
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:00,580
I could just
bust through the fence again.

589
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,510
No. Once was enough for that.

590
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:04,680
I just have to get the right word written.

591
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,880
Something that makes Wilbur
so special

592
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:09,420
that Zuckerman will never
think about killing him again.

593
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,620
You need something snappy,
like "pig supreme."

594
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,120
That sounds like a dessert.

595
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:16,360
So, what's the point, anyway?
It won't work.

596
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:20,560
Could you please, just once,
say something-omething positive?

597
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:23,330
Okay. I'm positive it won't work.

598
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,300
How about
"harmoniously proportioned"?

599
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,110
- Harmoniously proportioned, yes!
- Stop that! You're following again.

600
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:33,710
Please, all of you!
What's the perfect word for Wilbur?

601
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:35,610
How about "delicious"?

602
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:38,890
Or "nutritious"? Or "extra crispy"?

603
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,380
How about...

604
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:44,090
- Did you get him?
- Yep. Bull's-eye.

605
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:46,590
How about "terrific, terrific, terrific"?

606
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:49,990
Good. Much too long, though.
I've only got so much web.

607
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,330
But one "terrific" might work.

608
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:56,130
It simply isn't true.
The pig is not terrific.

609
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:59,730
Look at him! He's absolutely average.

610
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:03,640
If you wish to be truthful,
then that is the word you should write.

611
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:04,740
"Average."

612
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:08,880
Wilbur, this only works
if the word I write is true.

613
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:11,920
And only you can tell us
which word that is.

614
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:13,440
So look around.

615
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:17,020
We've all gathered around to help you.

616
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:20,060
Now tell everyone how you feel.

617
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:30,970
Look, there's a red one! And a blue one!

618
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:33,400
Avery! You'll never catch me!

619
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:35,650
I'm going to get you!

620
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,780
Look at the fireworks, Mom!

621
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:44,730
Avery, come on
if you ever want to catch me!

622
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,430
This web thing is really paying off.

623
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:01,790
Mr. Zuckerman!

624
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:10,010
There it is, side to side,
right in the same place. "Terrific."

625
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:11,480
It was the most amazing thing!

626
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:15,180
Last time we had hundreds of people.
This time it's going to be thousands!

627
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,820
It says "terrific" just as clear as day.

628
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,580
T-E-double-R-I-F-I-C.

629
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,120
I mean, can you imagine a spider
being able to spell that word?

630
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:27,960
I don't think I could spell that word
till the 10th grade.

631
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,400
- Fifty cents.
- Do you like that one, sir?

632
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,720
That's going to be $1.

633
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:44,170
- Wow!
- Gather 'round, folks!

634
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:48,480
Remember, you saw it right here
at Zuckerman's.

635
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:52,220
And, before you leave, don't forget to
take some of our berries home with you!

636
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,590
- So, you think this might work?
- Nope.

637
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:57,120
Dare I say it? He looks "terrific."

638
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:58,190
Look at them all!

639
00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:02,430
Yeah. Smile pretty.
I wish geese had teeth.

640
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:08,130
Been down here since dawn...

641
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:11,900
What are you suggesting? That Fern
has something to do with all this?

642
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,140
How else could those words
have gotten into that web?

643
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:18,680
I know everyone is saying
it's some kind of miracle, but...

644
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:21,960
But what? You don't think it is?

645
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:23,410
Do you?

646
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:26,850
The web itself is a miracle.

647
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:30,010
Wouldn't you agree?

648
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:33,090
Well, can you spin one?

649
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:36,990
- I can crochet a doily.
- Because someone taught you how.

650
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:40,460
Nobody teaches a spider.
They just know how to spin a web.

651
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:43,830
Don't you think that's a miracle?

652
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:51,080
As summer ended,
so did the excitement about the web.

653
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:54,480
Charlotte needed to
think of something special.

654
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:58,580
Special enough to change the way
people saw the world,

655
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:02,090
or at least one pig in the world, anyway.

656
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:07,260
The truth is, Charlotte feared she would
never find a word that could do all that.

657
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:11,700
And she had to hurry.
Time was running out for her.

658
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:16,580
But once a promise is made,
it needs to be kept.

659
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:19,670
- Still no web, huh?
- Nope.

660
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:23,710
I haven't seen one in, I'd say,
at least a month.

661
00:46:23,810 --> 00:46:27,380
Funny how you get used to
all those people being around the place.

662
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:31,060
Kind of quiet without them, isn't it?

663
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:35,550
I noticed the hinge pin's busted
on the damper in the smokehouse.

664
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:37,420
Want me to order a new one?

665
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,420
Suppose you better.
That's a special order.

666
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:44,290
Better get a jump on that if we're going
to smoke any ham before the holidays.

667
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,140
We may need another
cord of wood, too.

668
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:51,940
I'm just going to throw this out here
one more time. "Pig supreme."

669
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:54,640
Oh, Golly!
Now you're just beating a dead horse.

670
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:56,160
- Hey!
- Sorry.

671
00:46:56,510 --> 00:46:59,410
Look, I don't come across
many words in the field,

672
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:02,150
other than "Hyah!" or "Giddyup!"

673
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:05,180
But that rat's always dragging in trash
with writing on it.

674
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,280
I agree.

675
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:09,050
It's about time Templeton started
pulling his weight around here

676
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:10,650
instead of just eating it.

677
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:12,520
I bet he could bring us
some choice words.

678
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:16,630
I've got a choice word for you.
A little word called, "Uh-uh."

679
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:17,900
Well, that's two words.

680
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,870
And here's a few more.
Negative. No way. Nothing doing.

681
00:47:21,970 --> 00:47:24,870
I ain't breaking my back
to try and save "some pig,"

682
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:30,710
no matter how "terrific"
you think the little lunch meat is.

683
00:47:34,910 --> 00:47:36,780
You'll sing a different tune
when he's gone

684
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,950
and nobody brings around those
scrumptious buckets of slop.

685
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:42,630
And three, two...

686
00:47:43,550 --> 00:47:44,730
Cue the rat!

687
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:48,070
Let's get one thing straight.

688
00:47:49,290 --> 00:47:51,500
I don't care about the pig.

689
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:54,100
- What I care about is the slop.
- Of course.

690
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:58,770
And since I'll be at the dump anyway,
and it won't take any extra effort,

691
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:02,290
maybe, maybe I'll pick something up.

692
00:48:03,470 --> 00:48:05,130
You're very kind.

693
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:08,390
Don't go spreading it around.

694
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:11,230
What? What do you want?

695
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,980
You'll need your strength.

696
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:26,260
Thanks.

697
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:31,600
But, Dad, I heard them.

698
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,400
I heard them talking
about the smokehouse!

699
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:35,070
He's not your pig anymore.

700
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:36,970
Well, I wouldn't have sold him
in the first place

701
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,410
if I knew this is what
they were gonna do to him.

702
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:42,480
That's what happens
to a pig on a farm, Fern.

703
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:43,920
You know that.

704
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:48,200
I'll see about that.

705
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:55,230
I've got maybe two, three years
before she can out-argue me.

706
00:48:55,330 --> 00:48:56,910
Then I'm doomed.

707
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,930
And members of our own 4-H Club

708
00:48:59,030 --> 00:49:03,200
will have the opportunity to enter
livestock and poultry in the competition.

709
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:05,970
So, in addition to the rides and games,

710
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:08,610
make sure you show them your support,
as well.

711
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:10,530
Any questions? Rita.

712
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,540
Miss Lewis, can I bring my chickens?

713
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:16,050
Your chickens, I'm sure.
Pigs, chickens, horses and cows.

714
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:21,010
You certainly can,
and I hope you win first prize.

715
00:49:31,830 --> 00:49:35,010
How can he be in every cornfield?

716
00:49:35,230 --> 00:49:37,570
It can't be the same guy. It can't be!

717
00:49:37,670 --> 00:49:39,570
He's wearing the same hat.

718
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:42,170
I'm telling you, he is following us!

719
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:43,850
I hate that guy.

720
00:49:44,510 --> 00:49:47,510
I have got to get some corn, Elwyn!

721
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:49,410
All right! All right! All right!
This is crazy.

722
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:51,580
- There's two of us, right?
- Yeah.

723
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:54,250
Trust me, there's two of us,
and there's only one of him.

724
00:49:54,350 --> 00:49:57,050
I don't know, man. He scares me.
He really does.

725
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,720
- Just think about that corn. Corn.
- Yeah.

726
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:00,820
- The corn.
- Corn.

727
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:06,350
- All right, let's do it!
- Let's do it! Let's do it!

728
00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:12,570
- Abort! Abort! Abort!
- Abort! Abort! Abort!

729
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:17,940
Man, he is good!
I bet he's laughing at us.

730
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:20,780
Don't look at him!
Don't even give him the satisfaction.

731
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,350
Just think about something else.

732
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:24,250
- Think about something else.
- Anything.

733
00:50:24,350 --> 00:50:26,410
I think I see a rat.

734
00:50:26,950 --> 00:50:29,620
- That's good.
- No, really, I see a rat.

735
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:36,180
The rat is stealthy. The rat is nimble.
The rat is on the... whoa!

736
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:44,100
The rat is losing his touch.

737
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:47,900
- You want to go mess with him?
- Oh, yeah! I've got to peck something.

738
00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:49,270
Rat on three.

739
00:50:49,770 --> 00:50:51,270
One, two, three!

740
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:58,630
The rat has been spotted!

741
00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:05,110
The rat is not

742
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:06,950
enjoying this!

743
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:15,500
All this for slop?

744
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:18,670
The rat is desperate. The rat is trapped.

745
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:21,440
The rat needs to stop calling himself
"the rat."

746
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:25,580
"Find some words." Yeah, right,
the rat will never find words!

747
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,260
Hey, look. Words.

748
00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:32,850
- Hey, is he still in the can?
- He's in the can?

749
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:35,750
Maybe we should give him
some privacy. Always helps me out.

750
00:51:35,850 --> 00:51:37,890
No, no, genius, not that can.

751
00:51:37,990 --> 00:51:40,290
Where did he go? I can't see him.

752
00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:42,330
All I see is that fruit moving.

753
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:45,230
- What fruit?
- The fruit with the tail!

754
00:51:45,330 --> 00:51:47,230
They'll never get me now.

755
00:51:47,330 --> 00:51:50,670
- Let's go get him!
- Go get him!

756
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:08,830
The rat rules!

757
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:14,160
- We're pink!
- Hey, what the... Pink?

758
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:18,400
But that's all right, isn't it? I mean,
black pretty much goes with everything.

759
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:23,440
No, it's not all right.
That rat is going to pay!

760
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,200
"Radiant."

761
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:29,370
- This might just work.
- Might?

762
00:52:29,470 --> 00:52:31,930
Oh, for the love of Lucy!

763
00:52:33,910 --> 00:52:36,710
Here it comes. It did this yesterday.

764
00:52:36,810 --> 00:52:39,820
Look that way, everyone!
Right towards that cloud!

765
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,320
Good gracious.
Has it always done that?

766
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:43,920
No, it can't have.

767
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:47,680
- Brilliant! Absolutely brilliant!
- Wow!

768
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:49,230
Oh, yes.

769
00:52:49,490 --> 00:52:51,700
This word will work quite nicely.

770
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,860
Then my work is done.

771
00:52:54,830 --> 00:52:56,870
And now for the fruits of my labor.

772
00:52:56,970 --> 00:53:00,150
And the vegetables! And the gravy!

773
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:26,520
All right, now.

774
00:53:30,070 --> 00:53:31,070
"R."

775
00:53:34,470 --> 00:53:35,470
And stick.

776
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:43,250
And loop.

777
00:53:49,490 --> 00:53:50,490
And...

778
00:53:52,190 --> 00:53:55,610
Come on, Charlotte, you can do this.

779
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:58,040
Don't slow down yet.

780
00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:26,520
Welcome to Zuckerman's!
Thank you all for coming.

781
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:29,490
Well, the web says it
better than I ever could.

782
00:54:29,590 --> 00:54:32,850
That is some terrific, radiant pig!

783
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:42,530
And for that reason, I've decided
to enter Wilbur into the county fair.

784
00:54:43,970 --> 00:54:47,640
Did you hear what they said, Charlotte?
I'm going to the fair!

785
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:48,910
Going to the fair!

786
00:54:49,010 --> 00:54:51,180
Wilbur might just see Christmas
after all.

787
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:52,620
Is it good? Did we do it?

788
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,850
Yes, Wilbur. It's very good.

789
00:54:54,950 --> 00:54:55,970
Now, smile.

790
00:54:56,550 --> 00:54:59,590
The fair, Homer?
What's gotten into you?

791
00:54:59,690 --> 00:55:01,460
I don't know, Sis. It just come to me.

792
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:04,090
He's a runt, Homer.
He doesn't stand a chance.

793
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,760
Well done! Never had a doubt!

794
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:09,200
That spider did a heck of a job.
She's a hard worker.

795
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:12,170
Thank you, Charlotte.
You should take a little bow.

796
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:14,340
And have my beauty steal the show?

797
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:19,540
Now, go on and show them
what a radiant pig can do.

798
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:31,320
What do you mean
you're not going to the fair?

799
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:34,660
I'm going to get a prize.
Don't you want to be there?

800
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:37,160
Of course I do, Wilbur, very much.

801
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:39,460
I'm just not up to traveling
at the moment.

802
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:42,900
- Why not?
- Because I'm expecting.

803
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:44,840
Expecting what?

804
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:46,980
"Expecting" means...

805
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:50,310
I'm expecting you to do fine without me.

806
00:55:50,410 --> 00:55:54,380
You're getting to be a big pig,
and you'll do just great on your own.

807
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,460
Okay. I'll miss you.

808
00:56:04,390 --> 00:56:06,620
Come on, Homer, up and at 'em.

809
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,460
It's the big day.

810
00:56:12,430 --> 00:56:13,770
- Fern?
- Mom!

811
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:17,530
I'm not wearing that.

812
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:26,660
What the heck is she doing?

813
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:35,750
Bathed in buttermilk.

814
00:56:43,230 --> 00:56:45,210
I've had this dream.

815
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,770
I've got to say he really is some pig.

816
00:56:53,870 --> 00:56:56,040
That's my buttermilk working.

817
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:58,140
You sure you want to
go through with this, Homer?

818
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,540
If you lose, you're out your entry fee.

819
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:01,950
He could win, though.

820
00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:04,280
Stranger things
have been happening around here.

821
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:05,820
If he doesn't win, though?

822
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,550
Well, the way I figure it,
even if he does lose,

823
00:57:08,650 --> 00:57:12,870
I can make it all back
on the bacon alone.

824
00:57:14,190 --> 00:57:15,530
Wilbur! Wilbur!

825
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:17,360
Do something, Homer.

826
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:19,830
- What happened?
- I don't know. He just fainted.

827
00:57:19,930 --> 00:57:21,330
It's all right, hon.

828
00:57:21,430 --> 00:57:22,930
- Lurvy, get some water!
- It's okay, Wilbur.

829
00:57:23,030 --> 00:57:26,610
Charlotte, are you feeling-eeling okay?

830
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:31,170
Why is it so hard for that farmer to see
what is right in front of his face?

831
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:34,680
Look what Wilbur has done
for this farm. Isn't that better than ham?

832
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:37,380
Well, there's only one thing to do,
and I have to be there to do it.

833
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:40,450
Charlotte, you have your babies
to think about now.

834
00:57:40,550 --> 00:57:43,750
Yes, I know.
But I made a promise to my friend.

835
00:57:43,850 --> 00:57:47,120
A big blue ribbon ought to finally get
the point through that farmer's head.

836
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:49,690
- Easy, Lurvy. Easy.
- Coming through! Coming through!

837
00:57:49,790 --> 00:57:50,890
Here we go!

838
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,560
- There we go.
- He's up.

839
00:57:54,670 --> 00:57:56,670
Okay, let's see if he'll get in the crate.

840
00:57:56,770 --> 00:57:59,070
- Buttermilk.
- Templeton?

841
00:57:59,170 --> 00:58:02,610
I need you to go with me.
We'll have to find another word,

842
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:04,270
a really good one.

843
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:05,480
Sorry, lady.

844
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:09,150
Comes a time when the rat's got to ask
himself, "What's in it for the rat?"

845
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:11,580
- He's right. We've been to the fair.
- We have?

846
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:14,320
Remember? All that garbage there?

847
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:17,850
Oh, yeah! It's littered with hunks
of chewed-on funnel cakes...

848
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:18,960
How's that?

849
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:22,990
And dribs of ice cream
going sour in the sun.

850
00:58:23,090 --> 00:58:26,830
And spitty little cotton candy bits
ground into the mud.

851
00:58:26,930 --> 00:58:29,430
Popcorn, moldy cheese,
half-eaten sandwiches

852
00:58:29,530 --> 00:58:31,570
and sticky-icky-icky candy apples.

853
00:58:31,670 --> 00:58:34,440
Wait!
Go back to the moldy cheese thing.

854
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:36,570
I've never seen
so much disgusting trash!

855
00:58:36,670 --> 00:58:38,540
Come on, Wilbur. Good boy.

856
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:39,940
Don't hurt him, Dad!

857
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:43,110
Nearly made me gag, the stink of it,
especially that deviled egg.

858
00:58:43,210 --> 00:58:44,410
You better hurry up, rat.
They're gonna leave you!

859
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:45,480
Wait for me!

860
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:47,080
- Nice and easy.
- Come on, Wilbur. Good boy.

861
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:51,080
More food than you'll see in a lifetime!

862
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:52,860
- Bye, Aunt Edith!
- Bye.

863
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:56,290
Bye, Fern! Bye, Avery!
See you at the fair, guys!

864
00:58:56,390 --> 00:58:57,810
Hey, it worked!

865
00:58:58,130 --> 00:59:01,260
I think we milked it a little there
at the end, though.

866
00:59:01,370 --> 00:59:03,900
All right. All right, John,
I'll see you over there!

867
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,200
Charlotte, you're coming with me!

868
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:08,170
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

869
00:59:08,270 --> 00:59:09,870
Thank you for coming.

870
00:59:09,970 --> 00:59:15,550
- Good luck, Wilbur! Win that ribbon!
- Go get 'em, Wilbur!

871
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:18,160
We're going to the fair!

872
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:25,520
Going to the fair! Going to the fair!

873
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:29,680
- I'm going on the bumper cars.
- So fun!

874
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:44,170
The sign looks good, Homer.
Nice and even.

875
00:59:44,270 --> 00:59:46,490
All right, there we go.

876
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:51,560
There you go, Wilbur.

877
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:55,220
Okay, where's the filth?

878
00:59:56,190 --> 00:59:58,590
Have you heard that good things come
to those who wait?

879
00:59:58,690 --> 01:00:05,550
No, good things come to those
who find it and shove it in their mouth.

880
01:00:09,170 --> 01:00:12,270
Don't think I don't know, Fern,

881
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:15,510
that we're all here
because a determined little girl

882
01:00:15,610 --> 01:00:17,990
made a promise to a pig.

883
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:20,800
- Wilbur.
- Sorry.

884
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:22,720
I mean Wilbur.

885
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:27,860
I'm proud of you, honey.

886
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:32,060
Thanks.

887
01:00:34,790 --> 01:00:35,890
Fern? Avery?

888
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:43,470
I'm going to give you each 10 tickets
to do as you like out there.

889
01:00:43,570 --> 01:00:44,930
And you have to make them last all day,

890
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:46,900
so don't go spending them all at once.
Okay?

891
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,820
- Wow!
- All right!

892
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:51,670
- I'll be right back. Okay.
- Come on!

893
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:54,240
You're going to win the prize tomorrow.
I know it.

894
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:56,350
- Everything will be all right.
- Fern, let's go!

895
01:00:56,450 --> 01:00:57,450
Okay.

896
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:03,720
Oh, my.

897
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:07,560
Is that what we're up against?

898
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:18,580
Excuse me. What is your name?

899
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:24,010
When someone wants to get
your attention,

900
01:01:24,110 --> 01:01:26,510
what is it they call out?

901
01:01:26,610 --> 01:01:27,610
Uncle.

902
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:33,430
Tell me, Uncle,
what is the date of your birth?

903
01:01:33,950 --> 01:01:35,210
Your birthday?

904
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:43,390
For heaven's sake, all I want to know
is if you're a spring pig.

905
01:01:43,490 --> 01:01:48,750
Of course. What did you think I was?
A spring chicken?

906
01:01:49,930 --> 01:01:53,510
Huge and humorous. Aren't we talented!

907
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:55,140
Spring chicken.

908
01:02:02,550 --> 01:02:05,050
Charlotte, who are you talking to?

909
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:08,890
- The pig next door.
- Should I be worried?

910
01:02:08,990 --> 01:02:11,550
Of course not.
What good would that do?

911
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:14,820
Whoa!
Have you seen the beast next door?

912
01:02:14,930 --> 01:02:17,390
I think his mama was part hippo.

913
01:02:17,490 --> 01:02:19,800
If I had to name five of the fattest pigs
I've ever seen,

914
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:22,470
he'd be three of them. He's a shoo-in.

915
01:02:22,570 --> 01:02:25,940
Please. That pig is not nearly
as handsome as Wilbur,

916
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:28,500
or as harmoniously proportioned,

917
01:02:28,610 --> 01:02:31,240
- and not nearly as clean.
- There's a real tiebreaker.

918
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:35,580
We just have to prove that the finest pig
is not necessarily the fattest.

919
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:38,380
And you can do your part, Wilbur,
by getting some rest.

920
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:41,480
- I'm not tired, Charlotte.
- Okay.

921
01:02:41,590 --> 01:02:46,290
Well, could you excuse me
for just a minute, please?

922
01:02:46,390 --> 01:02:50,090
All right, Templeton, you're right.
That pig over there is a shoo-in.

923
01:02:50,190 --> 01:02:53,300
So, I need words that are even better
than that pig is fat.

924
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:55,500
Special words, and lots of them.

925
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:57,800
How about "pushy" and "demanding"?

926
01:02:57,900 --> 01:02:59,400
Templeton, please!

927
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:02,000
This is our last chance
to save Wilbur's life.

928
01:03:02,110 --> 01:03:04,670
You do realize
I'm just here for the food, right?

929
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:05,780
Of course.

930
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:23,510
Enjoy the ride.

931
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:25,660
One, please.

932
01:03:26,030 --> 01:03:27,830
Must be in the other pocket. Sorry.

933
01:03:27,930 --> 01:03:30,390
- One second.
- All right.

934
01:03:33,970 --> 01:03:35,070
Two, please.

935
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,100
Is that Fern up there?

936
01:04:02,830 --> 01:04:04,230
Well, I'll be.

937
01:04:04,330 --> 01:04:09,110
- She's with a boy.
- She is! She's with a boy!

938
01:04:10,310 --> 01:04:11,310
Oh, no.

939
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:14,780
She's with a boy.

940
01:04:16,210 --> 01:04:17,870
Manna from heaven!

941
01:04:24,590 --> 01:04:28,730
I don't know what this is, but I love it!

942
01:04:42,810 --> 01:04:44,470
One-stop slopping.

943
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:52,280
All right.
Let's go get the spider off my back.

944
01:04:52,850 --> 01:04:54,850
How come I'm not in a cornfield, Elwyn?
How come?

945
01:04:54,950 --> 01:04:58,350
Hey, hey.
They got all kinds of corn right here.

946
01:04:58,460 --> 01:05:02,160
You got your popcorn,
caramel corn, candy corn.

947
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:03,590
Stop torturing me!

948
01:05:03,690 --> 01:05:07,330
I'm starving here, and now I'm
cross-eyed because of this pink stuff.

949
01:05:07,430 --> 01:05:09,630
If I ever see that rat again...

950
01:05:09,730 --> 01:05:11,550
Words, words, words.

951
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:14,280
"Pork rinds."

952
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:17,430
That'll draw a crowd.

953
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:21,980
This looks promising.

954
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:27,260
Hey! That rat!

955
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:31,120
I'm going to get me some rat!

956
01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:33,220
Oh, not these birdbrains.

957
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:34,990
Let's get rid of them once and for all.

958
01:05:35,090 --> 01:05:38,670
...and everything. Rat on three! Three!

959
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:43,000
Wait up, Brooksie! I'm coming with you!

960
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:47,620
Little flamingoes!

961
01:05:48,870 --> 01:05:50,450
Come and get me!

962
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:54,820
- It's scary guy!
- Abort! Abort!

963
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:59,540
Peck him! Peck him, Elwyn!

964
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:05,250
Wait a minute. His eyes are buttons,
and his hair is straw.

965
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:06,390
This guy ain't real!

966
01:06:06,490 --> 01:06:07,690
- He's not?
- No!

967
01:06:07,790 --> 01:06:11,130
Oh, yeah! The rat rules! Take that!

968
01:06:11,330 --> 01:06:12,660
Do you know what this means?

969
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:13,860
- Yeah.
- What?

970
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:16,020
We could've had corn!

971
01:06:19,370 --> 01:06:21,270
Well, Your Highness,
you satisfied or what?

972
01:06:21,370 --> 01:06:23,710
'Cause I've got a spitty hunk of
pineapple upside-down cake out there

973
01:06:23,810 --> 01:06:24,910
with my name on it.

974
01:06:25,010 --> 01:06:26,830
Yes, very satisfied.

975
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:31,380
Be careful. If you keep this up,
someone might think you care.

976
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:33,780
Gee, I'm all choked up.

977
01:06:35,190 --> 01:06:36,190
Charlotte?

978
01:06:36,690 --> 01:06:39,990
If I don't win the prize tomorrow, they're
gonna send me to the smokehouse.

979
01:06:40,090 --> 01:06:41,720
You're going to win, Wilbur.

980
01:06:41,830 --> 01:06:44,060
And you're going to see
the snows of winter.

981
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:47,660
I told you, I never break a promise.

982
01:07:05,250 --> 01:07:06,250
Mom?

983
01:07:06,980 --> 01:07:09,840
Will you put these in for me?

984
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:14,280
You look like a girl!

985
01:07:14,690 --> 01:07:17,150
And I still hit like one.

986
01:07:22,070 --> 01:07:23,930
Well, what do you think?

987
01:07:24,030 --> 01:07:26,140
It's a great word. It's just...

988
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:27,240
Just what?

989
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:30,670
Is it the right word? Is it true?

990
01:07:30,770 --> 01:07:32,110
Because I don't really feel like

991
01:07:32,210 --> 01:07:37,180
I deserve any of the things
you've written about me.

992
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:39,980
Then it is the perfect word.

993
01:07:43,950 --> 01:07:44,950
The web!

994
01:07:48,290 --> 01:07:49,390
Hey, Wilbur!

995
01:07:55,570 --> 01:07:56,570
"Humble."

996
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:57,800
Hey, Wilbur.

997
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:00,840
If that's not a prize-winner,
I don't know what is.

998
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:02,710
He's going to win this thing, isn't he?

999
01:08:02,810 --> 01:08:08,870
Oh, Homer, I can't go up to that
grandstand looking like this.

1000
01:08:14,780 --> 01:08:15,780
Homer.

1001
01:08:24,490 --> 01:08:25,910
It's not fair.

1002
01:08:30,670 --> 01:08:35,200
Why didn't they tell us
the judging was going to be so early?

1003
01:08:35,310 --> 01:08:36,890
We did our best.

1004
01:08:40,980 --> 01:08:44,150
I'll get the truck and take him home.

1005
01:08:44,250 --> 01:08:47,270
I really thought we had a shot.

1006
01:08:52,820 --> 01:08:55,360
It's okay. It'll be okay.

1007
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:02,420
I told you. There it is! The web!

1008
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Mom...

1009
01:09:07,170 --> 01:09:08,750
What's going on?

1010
01:09:17,650 --> 01:09:20,350
It looks like it's "humble."

1011
01:09:32,830 --> 01:09:36,770
Excuse me. Thank you.
Coming through. Excuse me.

1012
01:09:36,870 --> 01:09:40,340
Mr. Zuckerman!
Could you come with me, please?

1013
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:43,060
Oh, and bring the pig, too.

1014
01:09:44,610 --> 01:09:45,610
Homer.

1015
01:10:15,410 --> 01:10:19,580
Ladies and gentlemen,
on behalf of the state of Maine,

1016
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:22,550
it gives us great pleasure to present

1017
01:10:22,650 --> 01:10:24,790
Zuckerman's famous pig!

1018
01:10:31,150 --> 01:10:32,330
Folks! Folks!

1019
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:36,060
I think we all remember
the start of summer,

1020
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:40,730
when the writing appeared on the web
in Mr. Zuckerman's barn.

1021
01:10:40,830 --> 01:10:44,090
And now it has happened yet again!

1022
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:47,140
Which is why the governors of the fair

1023
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:49,300
are honored to present

1024
01:10:50,340 --> 01:10:52,160
this handsome medal.

1025
01:10:52,410 --> 01:10:56,790
A token of our amazement
and our appreciation.

1026
01:11:05,620 --> 01:11:07,440
I love you, Wilbur.

1027
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:17,300
Well, what can I say about this pig
that hasn't already been said?

1028
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:20,300
I know a lot of you folks
have come out to the farm,

1029
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:22,270
and you've seen the words.

1030
01:11:22,370 --> 01:11:27,080
A lot of you have asked me,
"How could this have happened?"

1031
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:28,520
I don't know.

1032
01:11:28,980 --> 01:11:30,800
But it has happened

1033
01:11:31,750 --> 01:11:36,690
in a time when we really don't see
many miraculous things.

1034
01:11:36,790 --> 01:11:38,290
Or maybe we do.

1035
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:43,490
Maybe they're all right there around us,
every day,

1036
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:47,250
and we just don't know where to look.

1037
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:52,400
There's no denying
that our own little Wilbur,

1038
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:57,680
he's part of something
that's bigger than all of us.

1039
01:11:59,710 --> 01:12:01,770
And life on that farm

1040
01:12:02,650 --> 01:12:06,150
is just a whole lot better with him in it.

1041
01:12:06,250 --> 01:12:08,390
He really is some pig.

1042
01:12:09,620 --> 01:12:11,360
Way to go, Wilbur!

1043
01:12:29,310 --> 01:12:32,370
Charlotte, look how happy she is!

1044
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:34,140
Isn't that great?

1045
01:12:34,340 --> 01:12:36,240
Yes, it's wonderful.

1046
01:12:37,050 --> 01:12:38,610
Hey, what's that?

1047
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:40,940
This is my magnum opus.

1048
01:12:42,490 --> 01:12:44,550
What's a magnet opus?

1049
01:12:45,290 --> 01:12:46,390
Magnum opus.

1050
01:12:47,860 --> 01:12:52,190
It means "great work."
It's a nutrient-filled, waterproof egg sac.

1051
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:54,260
Really? There's eggs in there?

1052
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:56,580
My babies, 514 of them.

1053
01:12:57,830 --> 01:13:01,940
Wow! With 514 baby spiders
all over the place,

1054
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:04,370
it's going to be really radiant
in the barn!

1055
01:13:04,470 --> 01:13:08,810
Wilbur, I'm afraid they're not going to
make it back to the barn.

1056
01:13:08,910 --> 01:13:09,910
What?

1057
01:13:10,010 --> 01:13:11,550
What are you talking about?

1058
01:13:11,650 --> 01:13:13,950
You're not going to
leave them here alone, are you?

1059
01:13:14,050 --> 01:13:17,150
I have no choice. I'm languishing.

1060
01:13:17,250 --> 01:13:19,090
What does that mean?

1061
01:13:19,190 --> 01:13:20,990
It means I'm dying.

1062
01:13:21,090 --> 01:13:22,090
What?

1063
01:13:22,830 --> 01:13:24,250
You can't die!

1064
01:13:24,460 --> 01:13:27,160
Wilbur, we're born, we live,

1065
01:13:27,930 --> 01:13:30,570
and, when our time comes, we die.

1066
01:13:30,670 --> 01:13:33,100
It's just the natural cycle of life.

1067
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:35,500
No! No, just climb down.

1068
01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:38,440
I'll carry you the rest of the way.

1069
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:41,740
We'll go back to the barn,
and I'll take care of you.

1070
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:42,870
No, Wilbur.

1071
01:13:43,350 --> 01:13:46,120
I don't even have the strength
to climb down.

1072
01:13:46,220 --> 01:13:47,400
You have to.

1073
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:50,090
You've done so much for me!

1074
01:13:50,190 --> 01:13:52,760
And it was my great pleasure.

1075
01:13:52,860 --> 01:13:54,920
Please come down, Charlotte.

1076
01:13:55,020 --> 01:13:57,490
Please. There must be
something I can do.

1077
01:13:57,590 --> 01:13:58,610
No, Wilbur.

1078
01:13:58,830 --> 01:14:01,100
Don't you know
what you've already done?

1079
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:02,970
You made me your friend,

1080
01:14:03,070 --> 01:14:09,170
and, in doing so, you made a spider
beautiful to everyone in that barn.

1081
01:14:09,270 --> 01:14:12,840
I didn't do anything, Charlotte.
You did it all.

1082
01:14:12,940 --> 01:14:16,360
No. My webs were no miracle, Wilbur.

1083
01:14:16,850 --> 01:14:19,850
I was only describing what I saw.

1084
01:14:19,950 --> 01:14:21,770
The miracle is you.

1085
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:43,040
Templeton!

1086
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:45,640
Charlotte is very sick.

1087
01:14:45,740 --> 01:14:47,400
Yeah, and twisted.

1088
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:50,950
She's dying! She can't go home with us.

1089
01:14:51,050 --> 01:14:53,380
So, I need you to help me
take her egg sac with us.

1090
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:54,720
Did you say eggs?

1091
01:14:54,820 --> 01:14:57,050
It's an egg sac. And it's right up there,

1092
01:14:57,150 --> 01:14:58,790
and it has her children in it.

1093
01:14:58,890 --> 01:15:02,120
And I can't just leave it here.
What if something happened to them?

1094
01:15:02,230 --> 01:15:05,090
Now, I can't reach it,
so I need you to get it for me.

1095
01:15:05,190 --> 01:15:06,930
And I need you to do it now.

1096
01:15:07,030 --> 01:15:08,500
I don't think I like your tone.

1097
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:12,330
Can't you just once in your life think
of someone other than yourself?

1098
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:15,400
- A little further. Keep coming.
- Once? Once?

1099
01:15:15,510 --> 01:15:16,510
Come on.

1100
01:15:16,710 --> 01:15:18,170
No, you come on!

1101
01:15:18,270 --> 01:15:21,340
Who got his hindquarters pecked
to make you "radiant," huh?

1102
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:22,910
Templeton, that's who.

1103
01:15:23,010 --> 01:15:26,850
And who interrupted the gorging
of a lifetime so you could be "humble"?

1104
01:15:26,950 --> 01:15:29,620
Why, I think it was Templeton!

1105
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:32,500
Templeton! Templeton! Templeton!

1106
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:35,380
And do I get thanked?

1107
01:15:36,660 --> 01:15:37,660
No!

1108
01:15:37,830 --> 01:15:39,700
Well, has it ever occurred to you

1109
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:43,430
that even a rat
might like a little appreciation?

1110
01:15:43,530 --> 01:15:46,150
A little, dare I say, love?

1111
01:15:46,670 --> 01:15:49,400
Do it and you'll get dibs on my slop
for the rest of my life.

1112
01:15:49,510 --> 01:15:50,510
Done.

1113
01:15:50,710 --> 01:15:54,290
Hurry! Up in the corner on the ledge.

1114
01:16:06,660 --> 01:16:07,660
Templeton!

1115
01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:15,060
Come on!

1116
01:16:24,470 --> 01:16:26,370
Thank you, Templeton,

1117
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:28,980
for everything.

1118
01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:42,480
It's okay, just drop it. Hurry!

1119
01:16:45,930 --> 01:16:48,000
Here you go. Here's your medal.

1120
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:50,830
- In you go.
- Time to go home, Wilbur.

1121
01:16:50,930 --> 01:16:53,870
All right. Close her up, Lurvy.

1122
01:16:55,300 --> 01:16:56,720
Okay, easy now.

1123
01:17:10,620 --> 01:17:11,620
Goodbye,

1124
01:17:12,820 --> 01:17:14,960
my sweet, sweet Wilbur.

1125
01:17:18,290 --> 01:17:19,950
Goodbye, Charlotte.

1126
01:17:20,530 --> 01:17:21,630
I love you.

1127
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:12,050
Is that our lovely-ovely-ovely
little Wilbur?

1128
01:18:12,150 --> 01:18:14,720
- And he's got a medal!
- Strong work, kid.

1129
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:16,180
He looks so grown up.

1130
01:18:16,290 --> 01:18:18,850
- I always knew he could do it.
- Never had a doubt.

1131
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:20,860
Welcome home, Wilbur.

1132
01:18:23,090 --> 01:18:24,090
Wilbur?

1133
01:18:24,830 --> 01:18:26,190
Where's Charlotte?

1134
01:18:26,300 --> 01:18:28,360
I got a bad feeling, Bits.

1135
01:18:28,460 --> 01:18:29,460
Me, too.

1136
01:19:27,690 --> 01:19:31,530
Now, that isn't to say
Charlotte was gone forever.

1137
01:19:31,630 --> 01:19:33,730
She lived on
in the hearts of those that knew her,

1138
01:19:33,830 --> 01:19:36,450
and even those that didn't.

1139
01:19:37,030 --> 01:19:40,670
Something had changed
in Somerset County.

1140
01:19:40,770 --> 01:19:45,170
It was as if people knew
they lived in a special place now.

1141
01:19:45,270 --> 01:19:49,780
And, in small ways,
they started being special people,

1142
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:51,780
a little bit kinder,

1143
01:19:52,050 --> 01:19:54,350
a bit more understanding.

1144
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:57,850
And the animals felt different, too.

1145
01:19:57,950 --> 01:19:58,950
Closer.

1146
01:20:00,290 --> 01:20:05,190
The warmth of their friendship carried
them through the long, cold months.

1147
01:20:05,290 --> 01:20:08,260
They showed it
in little gestures of kindness,

1148
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:09,860
unusual patience,

1149
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:12,360
and promises kept.

1150
01:20:14,770 --> 01:20:21,070
Even the hardest of hearts found
themselves rising to the occasion.

1151
01:20:26,780 --> 01:20:30,680
And, finally, the greatest promise of all,

1152
01:20:31,020 --> 01:20:34,440
a spring pig saw his first snowfall.

1153
01:20:36,290 --> 01:20:42,510
It was as though Charlotte herself
had shaken it out of the sky.

1154
01:21:11,530 --> 01:21:17,430
The stillness of winter continued
to the first thaw, like it always does.

1155
01:21:17,530 --> 01:21:20,870
And then, the first buds of spring.

1156
01:21:21,700 --> 01:21:26,640
And, before you knew it,
life had come full circle.

1157
01:21:41,590 --> 01:21:43,560
They're here! They're here!

1158
01:21:43,660 --> 01:21:45,690
They're here, everybody!

1159
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:49,400
Hey, there. I'm Wilbur.
I'm a friend of your mom's.

1160
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:52,280
Boy, are we glad to see you!

1161
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:57,640
So creepy!

1162
01:21:58,140 --> 01:22:00,180
And cute! Just like their mother.

1163
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:02,660
They're so, so beautiful.

1164
01:22:04,210 --> 01:22:07,350
I just want to scoop them up
and hug them all.

1165
01:22:07,450 --> 01:22:09,110
Wow, you can fly!

1166
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:11,520
Look at you go!

1167
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:27,220
Now that is something to follow.

1168
01:22:31,940 --> 01:22:35,880
Go, little spiders! Be free! I wish I could.

1169
01:22:35,980 --> 01:22:40,550
I'm kidding, honey.
I think I got one inside my beak.

1170
01:22:40,650 --> 01:22:43,920
- Thanks, baby.
- That's my Golly-olly-olly.

1171
01:22:44,020 --> 01:22:45,020
Wow!

1172
01:22:45,890 --> 01:22:47,490
I can't believe they're really here.

1173
01:22:47,590 --> 01:22:50,050
- So pretty.
- Yeah, Bits.

1174
01:22:51,830 --> 01:22:53,700
You doing okay over there, Ike?

1175
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:56,770
I'm okay with it. I'm okay with it, Bets.

1176
01:22:56,870 --> 01:22:58,610
I'm okay with it.

1177
01:22:59,370 --> 01:23:03,110
Spiders are nice. Spiders are my friend.

1178
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:05,380
Spiders won't hurt me.

1179
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:17,150
Wait! What's happening?
What are you doing?

1180
01:23:17,250 --> 01:23:18,510
- Bye!
- Bye!

1181
01:23:19,290 --> 01:23:20,870
Please don't go.

1182
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:23,860
- Goodbye! Bye!
- Wait! Wait!

1183
01:23:25,190 --> 01:23:26,190
Goodbye!

1184
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:30,030
Where are you going?

1185
01:23:30,130 --> 01:23:31,430
We're setting forth.

1186
01:23:31,530 --> 01:23:35,570
We take to the breeze.
We go as we please.

1187
01:23:35,670 --> 01:23:37,510
We take to the breeze!

1188
01:23:37,610 --> 01:23:38,610
Bye!

1189
01:23:38,770 --> 01:23:40,510
But you can't go!

1190
01:23:41,180 --> 01:23:44,680
I had so much I wanted to tell you!

1191
01:23:45,210 --> 01:23:48,950
And someone I wanted to tell you about.

1192
01:23:55,260 --> 01:23:56,280
Salutations!

1193
01:23:58,030 --> 01:23:59,960
- Who said that?
- I'm up here.

1194
01:24:00,060 --> 01:24:02,030
- So am I.
- Me, too.

1195
01:24:02,130 --> 01:24:05,830
- We'd like to stay.
- We like it here.

1196
01:24:05,940 --> 01:24:07,800
And we like you, too.

1197
01:24:07,900 --> 01:24:12,810
You're staying? Oh, that's great!
That's really, really great!

1198
01:24:12,910 --> 01:24:15,940
Three friends! What are your names?

1199
01:24:16,050 --> 01:24:20,010
I'll tell you my name if you'll tell me
why you're trembling.

1200
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:22,120
Well, I think I'm trembling with joy.

1201
01:24:22,220 --> 01:24:25,290
- Then my name is Joy.
- Joy? Perfect.

1202
01:24:25,390 --> 01:24:28,190
- What was my mom's middle initial?
- A.

1203
01:24:28,290 --> 01:24:30,510
Then my name is Aranea.

1204
01:24:30,990 --> 01:24:32,490
Wow! Great name!

1205
01:24:33,060 --> 01:24:34,860
Why don't you pick my name for me?

1206
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:39,070
Something sensible.
Not too long, not too fancy.

1207
01:24:39,170 --> 01:24:40,830
And not too dumb.

1208
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:42,680
Tricky. How about

1209
01:24:44,610 --> 01:24:45,610
Nellie?

1210
01:24:45,710 --> 01:24:48,490
Nellie? I like it. Well done!

1211
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:51,070
Joy, Aranea, Nellie,

1212
01:24:51,850 --> 01:24:56,620
you have chosen a hallowed doorway
in which to spin your webs.

1213
01:24:56,720 --> 01:24:58,750
This was your mother's doorway.

1214
01:24:58,850 --> 01:25:01,960
She was loyal, brilliant, beautiful,

1215
01:25:02,060 --> 01:25:03,690
and she was my friend.

1216
01:25:03,790 --> 01:25:06,590
I will treasure her memory forever.

1217
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:11,270
So, to you, her daughters,
I pledge my friendship.

1218
01:25:11,370 --> 01:25:12,710
I pledge mine!

1219
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:15,220
- I do, too!
- So do I!

1220
01:25:24,980 --> 01:25:28,280
Okay, I'd like to make
a couple of announcements.

1221
01:25:28,380 --> 01:25:29,420
First of all,

1222
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:31,490
if you gals are word-lovers,

1223
01:25:31,590 --> 01:25:34,520
and you need
a few scraps of paper for inspiration,

1224
01:25:34,620 --> 01:25:36,360
don't look at me.

1225
01:25:36,730 --> 01:25:39,670
My word-fetching days are over.

1226
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:45,000
I'm not the rat I used to be.
I'm at least twice that.

1227
01:25:45,100 --> 01:25:48,270
So, if you need something to write,
try this,

1228
01:25:48,370 --> 01:25:50,350
"Some rat." Some rat.

1229
01:25:51,470 --> 01:25:52,570
Think about it.

1230
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:54,180
Slops! Oh, yeah!

1231
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:02,860
And, in an ordinary barn,

1232
01:26:03,090 --> 01:26:06,190
an ordinary pig, a runt no less,

1233
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:10,460
stood surrounded by friends,

1234
01:26:11,630 --> 01:26:14,170
welcoming his second spring.

1235
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:20,420
And that spring was followed by many,
many more.

1236
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:23,570
All because someone stopped to see
the grace

1237
01:26:23,670 --> 01:26:28,290
and beauty and nobility
of the humblest creature.

1238
01:26:29,550 --> 01:26:32,730
That is the miracle of friendship.

1239
01:26:34,220 --> 01:26:35,980
It is not often
that someone comes along

1240
01:26:36,090 --> 01:26:39,910
who is a true friend and a good writer.

1241
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:42,100
Charlotte was both.
