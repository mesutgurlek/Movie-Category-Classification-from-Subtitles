- It's great.

Hello? Anybody home?

- Looks the same, doesn't it?
- Doesn't it?

45
00:03:27,642 --> 00:03:31,010
- Smells the same too.
- Yeah, it does. Hello!

46
00:03:32,731 --> 00:03:35,138
- Do they have chickens?
- What's this?

47
00:03:35,191 --> 00:03:37,314
"For prompt service, blow me."

48
00:03:38,736 --> 00:03:40,979
- Interesting touch.
- Charming.

49
00:03:42,116 --> 00:03:44,108
- Blow it.
- Shall I?

Jeez!

54
00:03:59,927 --> 00:04:02,419
Don't mind Wormer. She hates people.

55
00:04:02,472 --> 00:04:05,805
Wormer, shut the frig up.
What can I do you for?

56
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:09,016
What happened to that dog's face?

57
00:04:09,061 --> 00:04:12,229
Porcupine quills.
Loves porcupines, hates people.

58
00:04:12,274 --> 00:04:14,101
She's in heat too.

59
00:04:14,151 --> 00:04:17,151
Too bad you're not a dog.
What can I do you for?

60
00:04:26,248 --> 00:04:29,368
Has your dog ever had a bath before?

61
00:04:29,418 --> 00:04:32,169
There she is.
That's a gorgeous cabin.

62
00:04:33,548 --> 00:04:36,668
OK. Hold it. That's good enough.

63
00:04:36,718 --> 00:04:39,470
That's bigger
than our honeymoon cabin.

64
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:43,345
You city-dwelling fools
are lucky to have this cabin.

65
00:04:43,392 --> 00:04:48,019
- It became available yesterday.
- We call it "the loon's nest".

66
00:04:48,064 --> 00:04:52,109
- Know what a loon is?
- Yeah, we have one in our family.

67
00:04:52,151 --> 00:04:56,363
We had a fishing party in there.
They caught their limit and blew.

68
00:04:56,406 --> 00:04:58,898
- It's all redecorated.
- Every bit.

69
00:04:58,951 --> 00:05:03,827
We sank over 300 bucks into it,
not counting what we spent on Lysol.

70
00:05:03,873 --> 00:05:08,121
- Is that right?
- It's beautiful. Enjoy your stay.

71
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:11,253
- Thanks.
- How could you not in this place?

72
00:05:11,296 --> 00:05:13,836
You could get the shits
from the well water.

73
00:05:13,884 --> 00:05:16,458
- What did he say?
- I missed it.

74
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:45,492
What a gas.

75
00:05:45,543 --> 00:05:48,380
Chet's gonna shit a solid gold brick!

76
00:05:49,632 --> 00:05:52,254
I'll go see where he's bivouacked
the family.

77
00:05:52,302 --> 00:05:54,922
This is very unfair, Roman.

78
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:57,926
What? We're a family,
for crying out loud!

79
00:05:57,975 --> 00:06:01,558
We're always inviting Chet and Connie
to the islands.

80
00:06:01,604 --> 00:06:05,684
- We weren't invited here.
- They'll be tickled to see us.

81
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:09,316
Honey? I found out
what was stinking up the shower.

82
00:06:10,322 --> 00:06:12,860
A present from me to you.

83
00:06:14,326 --> 00:06:17,945
How thoughtful.
Put it in there with the others.

84
00:06:17,997 --> 00:06:20,666
There's fish everywhere.
Look, a pink one.

85
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:24,492
All right, let's leave this stuff
right here, OK?

86
00:06:24,546 --> 00:06:27,381
Get your bathing suit
and we'll go to the lake.

87
00:06:27,424 --> 00:06:30,839
No, you go.
I just can't seem to relax in filth.

88
00:06:30,885 --> 00:06:33,757
We'll all clean up later. Let's go.

89
00:06:33,806 --> 00:06:36,842
Someone has to find the toilet seat.

90
00:06:36,893 --> 00:06:40,143
- Buck found it on the sun porch.
- Sun porch?

91
00:06:40,188 --> 00:06:42,477
- It makes you wonder.
- No excuses.

92
00:06:42,524 --> 00:06:44,434
- What are you doing?
- I don't know.

93
00:06:44,485 --> 00:06:46,442
- Stop it.
- The kids are at the lake.

94
00:06:46,486 --> 00:06:48,978
- Chet, what are you doing?
- Nothing.

95
00:06:49,031 --> 00:06:50,525
Honey, no.

96
00:06:50,574 --> 00:06:53,575
We got the house to ourselves. Hello!

97
00:06:53,619 --> 00:06:56,537
Oh, no, what happened? I'm sorry.

98
00:06:56,581 --> 00:06:59,950
I just don't feel like this.
I'm tired, I'm stinky.

99
00:07:00,001 --> 00:07:01,994
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

100
00:07:02,045 --> 00:07:05,165
- We got the house by ourselves.
- What about the kids?

101
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,375
- They're down the lake.
- Don't!

102
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,881
- Let's go to the bedroom.
- Why?

103
00:07:09,928 --> 00:07:13,013
That's the great thing
about being in the woods.

104
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:15,929
- What are you feeding me now?
- Come on.

105
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:19,597
You can run around naked
and you won't run into anybody.

106
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:22,056
- Is that right?
- Yes.

107
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:23,437
Really?

108
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:28,564
Do you think it's possible
that we could play fashion parade?

109
00:07:28,617 --> 00:07:30,609
- I don't want to play.
- Why?

110
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,528
- You get to wear the good outfits.
- I'll let you wear them.

111
00:07:34,581 --> 00:07:37,500
- You will?
- You will be Shelana.

112
00:07:38,378 --> 00:07:42,707
- Shelana, the oak tree woman.
- I love being the oak tree woman!

113
00:07:42,757 --> 00:07:46,209
- Temptress of the woods.
- Yes!

114
00:07:46,261 --> 00:07:50,093
And I will be Burt. A guy named Burt.

115
00:07:51,142 --> 00:07:54,725
I love it when you're Burt.
You're always so manly.

116
00:07:54,771 --> 00:07:57,226
Or I could be Smokey's cousin Horny.

117
00:07:57,273 --> 00:08:00,275
- He has endurance too.
- Yes, he does.

118
00:08:02,404 --> 00:08:04,443
(Roman) Anybody home?

119
00:08:04,489 --> 00:08:06,861
(Chuckling)

120
00:08:06,908 --> 00:08:11,784
Shelana the woods temptress
with Horny the bear, Smokey's cousin?

121
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,910
OK. OK.

122
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,413
- Turn that off.
- Oh, yeah! No, Chester, you said it.

123
00:08:19,464 --> 00:08:22,170
Do it on the floor!

124
00:08:22,218 --> 00:08:24,340
Beautiful style. That's all right.

125
00:08:24,386 --> 00:08:28,336
Role-playing helps in a marriage
after a while.

126
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,467
Turn the damn thing off.

127
00:08:34,315 --> 00:08:37,813
That was quite a surprise.
You got me.

128
00:08:37,859 --> 00:08:39,900
(Chuckles)

129
00:08:39,946 --> 00:08:42,651
And the whole week you'll be here.

130
00:08:42,699 --> 00:08:45,451
Ha-ha, OK!

131
00:08:45,493 --> 00:08:48,245
Oh, wow. Just something.

132
00:08:49,289 --> 00:08:51,863
Anyway, you're an intelligent man.

133
00:08:51,917 --> 00:08:53,495
Thank you.

134
00:08:53,544 --> 00:08:55,620
- Make a good living.
- Not bad.

135
00:08:55,671 --> 00:08:57,830
- Got a good life.
- Pretty good.

136
00:08:57,882 --> 00:08:59,708
- Answer me this.
- Sure.

137
00:08:59,758 --> 00:09:03,211
Why would you want to come
to a no-man's-land like this

138
00:09:03,263 --> 00:09:06,051
and live like a barbarian for a week?

139
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,099
- You wouldn't understand.
- Try me.

140
00:09:10,187 --> 00:09:14,269
I have great memories of this country.
I used to come here with my dad

141
00:09:14,318 --> 00:09:17,152
and I want the boys to have
the same memories.

142
00:09:17,195 --> 00:09:21,656
Look around you, Roman, for God's
sakes, this is beautiful country.

143
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,527
Take a good look.

144
00:09:23,577 --> 00:09:26,828
I'll tell you what I see,
if you want to know.

145
00:09:26,873 --> 00:09:28,949
Yeah, I'm curious.

146
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,080
The underdeveloped resources
of Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan,

147
00:09:33,129 --> 00:09:37,627
a consortium exploiting over
a billion dollars in forest products.

148
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:40,843
I see a paper mill
and a mining operation,

149
00:09:40,888 --> 00:09:44,424
a green belt between lakeside condos
and a waste management facility

150
00:09:44,476 --> 00:09:48,176
focusing on the newest rage in waste -
medical refuse.

151
00:09:48,229 --> 00:09:51,978
Infected bandages, body parts,
IV tubing, syringes,

152
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:55,228
fluid, blood, radioactive waste -
all contained,

153
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:58,530
sunken in the lake
and sealed for centuries.

154
00:09:58,575 --> 00:10:01,148
I ask you, what do you see?

155
00:10:04,622 --> 00:10:06,782
I just see...

156
00:10:06,834 --> 00:10:08,910
see trees.

157
00:10:08,961 --> 00:10:12,294
No one ever accused you
of having a grand vision.

158
00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:15,791
While the ambitious scramble
for wealth and power,

159
00:10:15,844 --> 00:10:18,215
the Chets of the world can lay back

160
00:10:18,262 --> 00:10:21,513
and casually stroll along life's path.

161
00:10:21,558 --> 00:10:24,050
- That's a compliment.
- Oh, thanks.

162
00:10:24,103 --> 00:10:28,231
The rest of us will probably die
of strokes long before you!

163
00:10:28,274 --> 00:10:30,682
I hope so. Wouldn't that be great?

164
00:10:30,735 --> 00:10:35,895
To see a bunch of people drop
that you hate. That'd be something else.

165
00:10:36,907 --> 00:10:39,578
My goodness! My goodness me.

166
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:42,538
I'm going to walk down life's path
right now.

167
00:10:42,581 --> 00:10:44,739
Get the barbecue going, hot dogs...

168
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:48,078
Wait a minute. No way.
Wait a hot shit minute.

169
00:10:48,129 --> 00:10:51,130
Rule one - no relative of mine
is eating hot dogs

170
00:10:51,174 --> 00:10:53,926
as long as he's sharing my cabin. Katie!

171
00:10:55,138 --> 00:10:58,552
Do you sense the presence
of an alien life form?

172
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,516
Now you mention it, I do sense
something kind of strange.

173
00:11:07,107 --> 00:11:08,768
Oh, sh...

174
00:11:08,819 --> 00:11:11,736
(# Theme from The Twilight Zone)

175
00:11:13,991 --> 00:11:16,316
Did I tell you
about the futures market?

176
00:11:16,369 --> 00:11:19,738
- Probably.
- We got a Deutschmarks contract,

177
00:11:19,789 --> 00:11:22,956
sat on it a week, sold it,
took in a 300% profit.

178
00:11:25,922 --> 00:11:29,621
Well, easy money
is money easily lost.

179
00:11:29,675 --> 00:11:33,293
I can't believe how old-fashioned
your thinking is.

180
00:11:34,723 --> 00:11:38,767
- 300% profit, huh?
- Sometimes 200% or 100%.

181
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:41,384
Take the good with the bad.

182
00:11:41,438 --> 00:11:44,273
Yeah. Still, that's pretty good.

183
00:11:44,316 --> 00:11:48,445
Point of the matter is,
you should have your piece too.

184
00:11:49,197 --> 00:11:50,821
Whoa! Hot!

185
00:11:50,865 --> 00:11:55,195
- How are those tails?
- They're 28 bucks a pop.

186
00:11:55,245 --> 00:12:00,369
28? Oh, my God. Chet and I haven't
had lobster since our anniversary.

187
00:12:01,376 --> 00:12:04,746
- Oh, my God. A jumping lobster!
- Save that one.

188
00:12:04,798 --> 00:12:07,502
- That'll be for me.
- I'll make sure of that.

189
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:10,220
The gourmet here wanted hot dogs.

190
00:12:11,262 --> 00:12:13,421
You know what they're made of?

191
00:12:13,473 --> 00:12:15,466
Lips and assholes.

192
00:12:15,517 --> 00:12:19,598
(Sarcastic laughter)
I'm old-fashioned. I like assholes.

193
00:12:19,647 --> 00:12:21,474
Ha! And I like lips!

194
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:26,774
If I could market lips like those,
I'd make another million!

195
00:12:26,822 --> 00:12:28,898
(Laughter)

196
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:37,455
(Roman) Lobster turned out all right,
if I do say so myself.

197
00:12:38,418 --> 00:12:41,787
We should go into town
and pick up a ski boat.

198
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,914
What do you say? Sound good, guys?

199
00:12:43,965 --> 00:12:47,500
Uncle Roman will blow some coin
on a kick-ass drag boat.

200
00:12:47,552 --> 00:12:49,510
We're renting a pontoon boat.

201
00:12:49,555 --> 00:12:52,925
Pontoon boat. What are you going to do
with a pontoon boat?

202
00:12:52,976 --> 00:12:55,431
Retake Omaha Beach?

203
00:12:55,478 --> 00:12:59,607
Not at all. A pontoon boat,
you go out and cruise the lake.

204
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:02,355
You swim from them, fish from them,

205
00:13:02,403 --> 00:13:06,067
even bring the barbecue out.
You have a great time.

206
00:13:06,114 --> 00:13:08,238
You tour the lake in comfort.

207
00:13:08,284 --> 00:13:10,609
You guys want to cruise in comfort

208
00:13:10,662 --> 00:13:13,497
or would you rather skim the waves
in a jet boat?

209
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,616
Jet boat!

210
00:13:15,667 --> 00:13:18,158
- Sorry, Dad.
- (Roman) Attaboy, Benny!

211
00:13:18,211 --> 00:13:20,668
All right, that's my man.

212
00:13:20,715 --> 00:13:22,754
Care to put it to a vote?

213
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,714
We don't need a vote.
You want a jet boat, get a jet boat.

214
00:13:26,762 --> 00:13:30,132
- Buck and I are getting a pontoon boat.
- Sorry, Dad.

215
00:13:30,183 --> 00:13:32,390
Directly from the mouths of babes!

216
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:35,390
Are you going to argue
or enjoy yourselves?

217
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:37,396
I'm enjoying, Chet's arguing!

218
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:41,522
How about if the kids catch fireflies?
We can play cards.

219
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:46,234
Cara, Mara. You little dolls want
to go outside and catch fireflies?

220
00:13:46,285 --> 00:13:48,573
Honey, they don't like bugs.

221
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,705
What? All kids like bugs. They're cute.

222
00:13:51,749 --> 00:13:55,166
Especially fireflies.
Their butts light up.

223
00:13:55,212 --> 00:13:57,287
(Screams echo)

224
00:14:00,008 --> 00:14:02,581
I am a killer Monopoly player.

225
00:14:02,636 --> 00:14:05,174
Roman taught me. He's vicious.

226
00:14:05,222 --> 00:14:08,972
- (Roman) Buddy Riecher died.
- Oh, no.

227
00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:11,094
President of Energy Resources.

228
00:14:11,145 --> 00:14:13,471
- Honey.
- Died in bed.

229
00:14:13,523 --> 00:14:17,107
- He was your mentor, wasn't he?
- A man I admired.

230
00:14:17,153 --> 00:14:20,188
- I'm trying to read here!
- Sorry. Sorry.

231
00:14:20,238 --> 00:14:23,442
I think I have to, er, tell you this story.

232
00:14:24,535 --> 00:14:28,320
A story that might save your lives
up here in the woods.

233
00:14:28,373 --> 00:14:31,042
I know the Heimlich maneuver.

234
00:14:32,502 --> 00:14:34,579
No. This is a...

235
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,915
a bear story.

236
00:14:40,011 --> 00:14:42,086
A true bear story.

237
00:14:44,724 --> 00:14:47,346
Connie and I honeymooned
at this very lake.

238
00:14:47,394 --> 00:14:49,268
Big spender!

239
00:14:49,313 --> 00:14:52,978
- We stayed at my uncle's cabin.
- Uncle George?

240
00:14:53,024 --> 00:14:55,266
Yeah. That's right.

241
00:14:55,319 --> 00:14:57,811
One night
we were getting ready for bed

242
00:14:57,864 --> 00:15:02,859
and we heard this terrible noise
out by the trash cans.

243
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:05,319
You remember? And, er...

244
00:15:05,372 --> 00:15:09,869
I went downstairs to check it out,
looked out the window...

245
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:14,123
and there...

246
00:15:14,174 --> 00:15:19,216
was the biggest,
baddest bear in the north woods.

247
00:15:19,263 --> 00:15:24,091
- Sure, Dad.
- No, it's true. It's true.

248
00:15:24,143 --> 00:15:28,556
This bear was over eight feet high.

249
00:15:29,774 --> 00:15:33,226
With big, white teeth.

250
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:36,730
- (Growling)
- Fangs...

251
00:15:36,782 --> 00:15:38,858
stained pink...

252
00:15:40,077 --> 00:15:43,945
from whatever it killed
before it got to our cabin.

253
00:15:45,334 --> 00:15:47,491
It was frightening.

254
00:15:48,962 --> 00:15:50,955
Frightening.

255
00:15:51,965 --> 00:15:57,007
- The paws on this thing were immense.
- Urgh.

256
00:15:57,054 --> 00:15:59,972
With big, black claws.

257
00:16:01,017 --> 00:16:03,342
Razor sharp...

258
00:16:03,394 --> 00:16:05,933
like Freddy Krueger.

259
00:16:05,981 --> 00:16:08,020
(Screams)

260
00:16:09,067 --> 00:16:11,523
Only worse, worse.

261
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:15,949
This wasn't a movie.
This was happening right in front of me.

262
00:16:15,993 --> 00:16:19,027
And all that separated me
from that bear...

263
00:16:20,163 --> 00:16:21,788
was a pane of glass.

264
00:16:21,831 --> 00:16:24,620
Honey, maybe we shouldn't
tell this story...

265
00:16:24,669 --> 00:16:27,124
- It's fine.
- I'm thinking about nightmares.

266
00:16:27,171 --> 00:16:30,125
No, no. They have to hear this.

267
00:16:30,174 --> 00:16:35,417
Like I say,
it might save their life one day.

268
00:16:37,516 --> 00:16:42,261
Now, I saw that bear. It saw me.

269
00:16:43,188 --> 00:16:45,181
And it was hungry.

270
00:16:46,193 --> 00:16:48,185
Hungry for blood!

271
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:51,901
Human blood.

272
00:16:51,948 --> 00:16:55,567
You see, once a bear gets a taste
for blood...

273
00:16:56,829 --> 00:16:58,821
it craves it.

274
00:16:59,874 --> 00:17:04,833
It needs it.
It will do anything it can to get it.

275
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,251
That bear had become...

276
00:17:07,298 --> 00:17:09,375
a man-eater!

277
00:17:10,386 --> 00:17:14,169
Our eyes locked. My heart was pumping.

278
00:17:14,222 --> 00:17:20,512
Pump, pump, pump, pump, pump.

279
00:17:20,564 --> 00:17:24,775
I ran into the living room,
grabbed the shotgun off the mantle,

280
00:17:24,817 --> 00:17:30,158
turned around, and there was that bear
right in the window.

281
00:17:30,199 --> 00:17:33,984
Its breath was fogging up the glass.

282
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:41,168
And suddenly,
it let out this god-awful roar.

283
00:17:41,211 --> 00:17:45,161
(Roaring)

284
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:49,962
It started smashing the walls.
Pots and pans started rattling,

285
00:17:50,013 --> 00:17:53,382
the walls shimmering
and the floorboards lifting.

286
00:17:53,433 --> 00:17:57,182
I knew then that it was either the bear
or your mom and I.

287
00:17:57,229 --> 00:18:01,476
So I raised the rifle,
I took aim and I fired.

288
00:18:01,525 --> 00:18:03,068
(Gunshot echoes)

289
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:05,270
- You wasted her?
- No, Benny.

290
00:18:05,322 --> 00:18:08,690
- A shotgun's not going to kill that.
- What happened?

291
00:18:08,741 --> 00:18:13,071
The buckshot shaved the hair
clean off the top of its head.

292
00:18:13,121 --> 00:18:16,242
It ran off. We never saw it again.

293
00:18:17,293 --> 00:18:19,749
I hear from my uncle now and then...

294
00:18:21,005 --> 00:18:26,760
and he'd tell us about
the baldheaded killer bear in the area.

295
00:18:28,639 --> 00:18:31,557
The baldheaded killer bear...

296
00:18:32,643 --> 00:18:35,099
of Clare County.

297
00:18:35,146 --> 00:18:40,935
- Is she still around?
- Oh! No, no. That bear's gone.

298
00:18:40,985 --> 00:18:44,937
Well, she may be out there. (Sighs)

299
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:47,908
Crazy, bloodthirsty as ever.

300
00:18:49,037 --> 00:18:52,121
So when you go to bed tonight...

301
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:55,036
if you hear a noise...

302
00:18:55,085 --> 00:18:57,161
whatever you do...

303
00:18:57,212 --> 00:19:00,333
don't look out the window.

304
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:03,381
Because it might be a bear!

305
00:19:03,427 --> 00:19:05,716
(Screaming)

306
00:19:05,763 --> 00:19:08,136
Christ! I'm half-drunk here, Chet!

307
00:19:08,183 --> 00:19:11,801
- Are you trying to give me nightmares?
- Come on.

308
00:19:11,853 --> 00:19:14,640
I can't believe you, Dad!

309
00:19:14,689 --> 00:19:17,264
- Benny, honey.
- Thank you!

310
00:19:17,318 --> 00:19:22,478
I'm 25 pounds overweight, I don't
need a blast to the ticker like that!

311
00:19:22,531 --> 00:19:27,988
- Really inappropriate, Chet.
- What? It was a story. Come on.

312
00:19:29,081 --> 00:19:33,162
Oh, come on.
It was a kind of true story.

313
00:19:33,211 --> 00:19:36,958
Part of it happened.
I just embellished a bit. Come on!

314
00:19:37,005 --> 00:19:39,379
What? What is that look?

315
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:45,221
So now I get the look?
I was just trying to have fun.

316
00:19:46,016 --> 00:19:47,974
Oh, God!

317
00:19:48,018 --> 00:19:50,688
So I made the fangs a little bigger. Jeez!

318
00:19:57,654 --> 00:20:02,151
(Chet) You have nothing
to be afraid of, OK? I mean it.

319
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:07,367
It's a story my dad told me
and I'm sure his dad told him,

320
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:10,036
and I'm telling you. It's made up.

321
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:14,248
One day you're going to tell it
to your kids, I guarantee it.

322
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,461
Good evening. How's it going?

323
00:20:24,267 --> 00:20:26,557
Listen, girls...

324
00:20:26,604 --> 00:20:28,892
As your father,

325
00:20:28,938 --> 00:20:32,355
I feel it incumbent upon me
to set the record straight

326
00:20:32,401 --> 00:20:35,736
on the validity of the tale
Uncle Chet shared with us.

327
00:20:36,865 --> 00:20:40,565
A story like that
coming from an authority figure

328
00:20:40,618 --> 00:20:42,860
could be traumatizing for kids.

329
00:20:42,913 --> 00:20:47,160
I had a similar experience with
my Uncle Roy and a story he told

330
00:20:47,209 --> 00:20:51,753
about a family who were attacked
by a band of psychiatric patients

331
00:20:51,798 --> 00:20:54,834
who had been subjected
to violent, hellish

332
00:20:54,884 --> 00:20:57,554
behavior modification experiments.

333
00:20:57,596 --> 00:21:01,011
They escaped from the metal boxes
the army kept them in,

334
00:21:01,057 --> 00:21:04,308
found this family in the woods,
fell upon them,

335
00:21:04,352 --> 00:21:06,595
slaughtered them and ate them.

336
00:21:06,648 --> 00:21:10,265
That story gave me nightmares
not to be believed,

337
00:21:10,317 --> 00:21:14,399
so I don't want Uncle Chet's
bear story to upset you.

338
00:21:14,448 --> 00:21:16,985
So I'm here to say
that there is no bear

339
00:21:17,033 --> 00:21:21,945
and that all Uncle Chet was saying
was just a yarn for our entertainment

340
00:21:21,997 --> 00:21:26,042
and even if there were a bear,
I'm in the house to protect you.

341
00:21:27,212 --> 00:21:32,040
So, no more thinking about bears,
all right?

342
00:21:32,092 --> 00:21:34,168
No more unpleasant things.

343
00:21:34,219 --> 00:21:36,758
We're going to close our eyes

344
00:21:36,806 --> 00:21:40,756
and dream about nice things.

345
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:45,852
About cuddly, soft, fluffy things.

346
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:49,648
OK?

347
00:21:49,695 --> 00:21:51,569
Super.

348
00:21:51,614 --> 00:21:54,022
Good night. Sleep tight.

349
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:06,042
(Raccoons chittering) 'Hey, kids...
New people in the loon's nest.'

350
00:22:06,087 --> 00:22:08,295
'They have Illinois plates, Mom.'

351
00:22:10,676 --> 00:22:14,212
'If they're from Chicago,
we'll be eating good.

352
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:19,222
'Lobster tails!

353
00:22:20,062 --> 00:22:22,767
'A shitload of raw hot dogs.'

354
00:22:23,859 --> 00:22:26,894
'You know what they're made of...

355
00:22:26,944 --> 00:22:29,317
'lips and assholes!'

356
00:22:46,383 --> 00:22:48,422
(Snoring)

357
00:22:48,468 --> 00:22:50,676
(Clock ticking)

358
00:22:57,687 --> 00:22:59,311
Honey?

359
00:23:00,356 --> 00:23:03,940
Chet? Where are you?

360
00:23:07,113 --> 00:23:11,277
Oh, God! That's rotted. Oh!

361
00:23:12,912 --> 00:23:15,829
Jerry Asner, please. Roman Craig.

362
00:23:15,873 --> 00:23:19,871
Yeah, I can't hold for long.
My signal's kind of weak.

363
00:23:32,892 --> 00:23:34,969
- Honey?
- Yes, Roman?

364
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:38,305
Why do Chet's kids look at him
like he's Zeus?

365
00:23:38,356 --> 00:23:42,485
My kids look at me like
I'm a rack of yard tools at Sears.

366
00:23:43,529 --> 00:23:46,280
I mean, why can't they connect
with me?

367
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:52,403
Maybe if you spent less time at work,
things would be different.

368
00:23:52,456 --> 00:23:55,824
Put a cork in it, honey.
Talkin' business. Jerry?

369
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:58,118
Roman. How are you?

370
00:23:58,171 --> 00:24:01,208
I'll save us trouble
and cut right to the chase.

371
00:24:01,258 --> 00:24:03,830
I've got an investment opportunity.

372
00:24:03,884 --> 00:24:07,219
You got about three minutes
and 25 grand? Jerry?

373
00:24:07,264 --> 00:24:09,007
Did you hear what I said?

374
00:24:09,058 --> 00:24:11,893
Lost the signal.
These phones don't work.

375
00:24:11,936 --> 00:24:16,230
- Maybe he hung up.
- Why would a minister hang up?

376
00:24:16,274 --> 00:24:19,726
- I've been to his church.
- Oh, yeah. Once!

377
00:24:21,988 --> 00:24:24,147
All right!

378
00:24:24,199 --> 00:24:26,487
How about that?

379
00:24:26,534 --> 00:24:29,702
We'll be scraping the bugs
off our teeth with this!

380
00:24:29,747 --> 00:24:32,867
- Dad.
- That's too much boat.

381
00:24:32,917 --> 00:24:34,992
- Look...
- It's just too much.

382
00:24:35,043 --> 00:24:38,628
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure. You hungry?

383
00:24:38,673 --> 00:24:42,043
Give me four chili dogs
and two plain dogs, please.

384
00:24:42,094 --> 00:24:45,677
- That's six hot dogs.
- It's for everybody.

385
00:24:45,723 --> 00:24:47,799
And I'm hungry.

386
00:24:48,893 --> 00:24:50,637
- So?
- Yeah.

387
00:24:50,687 --> 00:24:54,472
Do you mind if I just walk around?
Cruise the town?

388
00:24:54,525 --> 00:24:57,193
I can walk back when I'm done.

389
00:24:57,235 --> 00:25:01,898
All right. But you gotta promise me
we'll spend some time together.

390
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:04,026
- That's why we're here.
- I know.

391
00:25:04,077 --> 00:25:07,327
That's the whole point -
to be in the woods,

392
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:10,159
together, rugged,
manly, the full nine yards.

393
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:12,664
- Exactly.
- Right?

394
00:25:14,046 --> 00:25:16,086
- Give me a hug.
- What?

395
00:25:16,132 --> 00:25:18,457
- Give me a hug.
- Dad...

396
00:25:18,509 --> 00:25:22,756
- I'm too old for hugs.
- You're never too old for hugs.

397
00:25:22,805 --> 00:25:25,808
- Can I go now? Thank you very much.
- Go.

398
00:25:25,851 --> 00:25:30,643
Bring back your friends
for a ride in "suck my wake".

399
00:25:33,068 --> 00:25:35,144
(Engine roars)

400
00:25:37,739 --> 00:25:39,068
Great!

401
00:25:40,909 --> 00:25:43,152
You've got it in neutral!

402
00:25:44,412 --> 00:25:45,788
It's OK.

403
00:25:45,832 --> 00:25:48,703
It's in neutral. You gotta put it...

404
00:25:58,971 --> 00:26:01,640
(Laughter)

405
00:26:05,812 --> 00:26:09,312
- OK.
- I'll figure it out. Just give me the skis.

406
00:26:09,358 --> 00:26:12,727
I'm sorry. I forgot.
You're a professional skier.

407
00:26:12,778 --> 00:26:14,854
You don't need any notes.

408
00:26:14,905 --> 00:26:18,357
Any help from someone
who might know about skiing.

409
00:26:18,409 --> 00:26:21,246
- We'll go over it once more.
- Fine.

410
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,244
- This is important.
- OK!

411
00:26:23,288 --> 00:26:25,413
What are we doing sitting here?

412
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:29,243
He's teaching the kid.
He wants Benny to be safe.

413
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:32,167
Lean back. That feel better?

414
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:35,716
There you go. We're leaning back.
There's trouble.

415
00:26:35,762 --> 00:26:38,632
- What?
- Trouble. There's trouble.

416
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:42,680
Come on. What do we do?
Let go of the rope.

417
00:26:43,771 --> 00:26:46,557
If you're in trouble,
let go of the rope.

418
00:26:46,606 --> 00:26:50,771
Remember, go loose when you fall.
Just go loose.

419
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,897
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

420
00:26:52,948 --> 00:26:55,437
- He's shaking.
- He's got a new dance.

421
00:26:55,491 --> 00:26:59,537
- Hold this. Thanks, Dad.
- Are you going to ski or what?

422
00:26:59,579 --> 00:27:03,115
I can't tell you how important this is.

423
00:27:06,379 --> 00:27:08,751
(Roman) Let's go. Ski or flee.

424
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:10,874
Honey, he's waving.

425
00:27:11,968 --> 00:27:14,674
- He's going?
- He's going. Great.

426
00:27:18,267 --> 00:27:20,674
Whoa!

427
00:27:27,735 --> 00:27:29,812
Hey, Dad, let go of the rope!

428
00:27:30,906 --> 00:27:33,030
Oh, my God!

429
00:27:33,076 --> 00:27:35,198
Help me, for God's sake!

430
00:27:35,244 --> 00:27:38,494
Holy shit!

431
00:27:38,539 --> 00:27:40,782
Oh, no!

432
00:27:42,877 --> 00:27:44,835
Wow!

433
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,707
Whoa!

434
00:27:54,224 --> 00:27:56,632
You bastard!

435
00:27:58,395 --> 00:28:01,099
(Chet yelling)

436
00:28:02,483 --> 00:28:05,934
- You bastard!
- What's he saying?

437
00:28:07,447 --> 00:28:09,404
- You bastard!
- What's he saying?

438
00:28:09,449 --> 00:28:11,525
- Faster.
- Faster?

439
00:28:11,576 --> 00:28:13,449
Go faster.

440
00:28:13,494 --> 00:28:15,737
(Roman cackling)

441
00:28:17,583 --> 00:28:19,577
What the hell are you doing?

442
00:28:19,628 --> 00:28:22,164
I'd love to see him rocksie!

443
00:28:27,552 --> 00:28:30,043
I'm dead! I'm dead! I'm dead!

444
00:28:30,097 --> 00:28:32,802
I'm dead! I'm dying! I'm dying!

445
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:36,265
I'm dying! I'm dying!

446
00:28:39,148 --> 00:28:42,565
I'm alive. I'm alive.
Thank you. Thank you.

447
00:28:44,612 --> 00:28:46,771
Oh, no!

448
00:28:52,747 --> 00:28:55,617
(Screams)

449
00:29:07,972 --> 00:29:11,341
(Groaning)

450
00:29:19,192 --> 00:29:20,936
(Panting)

451
00:29:22,697 --> 00:29:24,772
(Cheering)

452
00:29:24,823 --> 00:29:27,659
(Man) What a show! What a champion!

453
00:29:37,921 --> 00:29:40,839
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like?

454
00:29:40,883 --> 00:29:43,802
I am not taking any more
of Roman's crap.

455
00:29:43,845 --> 00:29:46,052
You can stay cos I'm out of here.

456
00:29:46,098 --> 00:29:49,300
What happened that got you so crazy?

457
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:52,518
What happened?
Come on, what happened?

458
00:29:52,563 --> 00:29:57,024
How about Roman dragging me
all over the goddamn lake?

459
00:29:57,068 --> 00:29:59,855
- Have you seen my ass?
- Not recently.

460
00:29:59,904 --> 00:30:02,739
I'll be picking splinters out of it till I die!

461
00:30:02,782 --> 00:30:06,698
- Honey, come on.
- You find that funny? Hysterical!

462
00:30:06,746 --> 00:30:09,581
It wasn't funny
but because I love you...

463
00:30:09,624 --> 00:30:12,909
- Thanks a lot!
- What about the kids?

464
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,412
His kids? All right.
Let's talk about his kids.

465
00:30:16,465 --> 00:30:22,004
They're spooky. I'm waiting for their
heads to rotate and vomit pea soup.

466
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:26,762
- I mean our kids.
- Our kids already do that.

467
00:30:26,808 --> 00:30:30,972
What about this father-son thing?
You're gonna leave? Come on.

468
00:30:31,021 --> 00:30:34,141
- He's driving me crazy!
- You're a big man.

469
00:30:34,191 --> 00:30:37,110
You're a nice man
and you're above all this.

470
00:30:37,154 --> 00:30:39,728
- Oh, don't.
- You are.

471
00:30:39,782 --> 00:30:42,568
- Come on.
- I know it to be true.

472
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,987
Don't. Come on, I'm mad. I'm mad.

473
00:30:48,416 --> 00:30:51,583
Come on. All right, all right.
Am I being silly?

474
00:30:51,628 --> 00:30:53,870
Crazy. Stop.

475
00:30:54,965 --> 00:30:58,714
- Why do you always do this?
- I'm crazy about you. Kiss me.

476
00:31:00,304 --> 00:31:03,721
- Feel better?
- I do. I'm sorry. I feel like a kid.

477
00:31:03,767 --> 00:31:05,509
OK.

478
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:08,052
Why did you do this? I was ready to go!

479
00:31:08,105 --> 00:31:11,475
Why? I was almost in the car.

480
00:31:11,526 --> 00:31:15,024
Now I've got to spend a week
with Roman.

481
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:18,107
You're gonna have fun from now on.

482
00:31:18,157 --> 00:31:21,527
Roman's making goat-cheese pizza
to take to the lodge.

483
00:31:21,578 --> 00:31:24,331
- Making what?
- Er...

484
00:31:24,374 --> 00:31:26,116
- What did you say?
- Pizza.

485
00:31:26,166 --> 00:31:28,954
- You said something else.
- Big man pizza.

486
00:31:29,003 --> 00:31:31,328
What are you hiding?

487
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,125
- Tell me what it is.
- Pizza.

488
00:31:33,175 --> 00:31:37,717
No. You said a goat. Is he making
goat pizza? Hey, come here!

489
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:43,433
Roman, I've got a few things
to gnaw over with you.

490
00:31:43,478 --> 00:31:45,055
What's up?

491
00:31:45,104 --> 00:31:47,939
I found your kids
inside the mine perimeter.

492
00:31:47,982 --> 00:31:51,601
- What mine?
- There's an old mica mine.

493
00:31:51,654 --> 00:31:55,604
It's full of boreholes,
sinkholes, pits, caves, hollows.

494
00:31:55,658 --> 00:31:59,074
The war shut the facility down.

495
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,405
Anyway the kids go there
and yell down the holes

496
00:32:02,456 --> 00:32:04,664
so they can hear their voices echo.

497
00:32:05,669 --> 00:32:08,160
I won't tell you
what the teenagers do.

498
00:32:08,212 --> 00:32:10,882
- I'll bet!
- Tell Ripley too.

499
00:32:10,924 --> 00:32:12,419
Done.

500
00:32:12,468 --> 00:32:14,544
Take care of them, Roman.

501
00:32:16,598 --> 00:32:20,511
We could see a female
Elvis impersonator at Whitewater

502
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:23,680
and you want to wish happy birthday
to some guy?

503
00:32:23,731 --> 00:32:26,056
If you want to go to Whitewater, go.

504
00:32:26,108 --> 00:32:29,311
I find it more interesting
to pay my respects

505
00:32:29,361 --> 00:32:32,695
to a man who's lived on this earth
109 years.

506
00:32:32,739 --> 00:32:36,441
He's the oldest man in Canada.
Isn't that something?

507
00:32:36,495 --> 00:32:39,994
I'd rather see a 46-inch bust
singing Burning Love.

508
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,699
Yeah.

509
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:48,418
Hey, Wally.
How about a nice club soda?

510
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,792
I'm driving tonight.

511
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:55,221
Nice outfit.
You're Mr. Coordinated tonight.

512
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:57,887
- Well...
- Quite the look on you.

513
00:32:57,935 --> 00:33:02,431
Yeah. Well, the pants are riding
up the butt something fierce but...

514
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:04,806
look at that.

515
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:09,273
- Wally, how's the bear dump situation?
- We got a good one.

516
00:33:09,323 --> 00:33:11,778
Good evening, sir. Happy birthday.

517
00:33:11,825 --> 00:33:15,491
He must be hard of hearing
or something. Try again.

518
00:33:15,537 --> 00:33:18,907
Sprechen Sie Deutsch?
Do you speak English?

519
00:33:18,958 --> 00:33:21,628
Our sincerest congratulations, sir.

520
00:33:21,669 --> 00:33:24,789
You wishing Mr. Tomkins
a happy birthday?

521
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:27,509
I don't think the guy can hear us.

522
00:33:27,551 --> 00:33:31,550
How about a nice group photo?
Everybody get in there.

523
00:33:31,598 --> 00:33:34,170
- I push the red button?
- (Buck) Yeah.

524
00:33:34,225 --> 00:33:36,134
- How do you focus?
- You don't.

525
00:33:36,185 --> 00:33:38,593
- You don't focus?
- Push the button.

526
00:33:38,646 --> 00:33:43,522
I don't like them climbing around
Mr. Tomkins. He ain't no jungle gym.

527
00:33:43,568 --> 00:33:46,902
Girls, why don't you kiss Mr. Tomkins
on the cheek?

528
00:33:46,947 --> 00:33:49,190
- No.
- A nice kiss on the cheek.

529
00:33:49,242 --> 00:33:53,192
Come on, it's cute!
What old man wouldn't like it?

530
00:33:53,247 --> 00:33:56,697
A dead one.
Bill died in the car on the way over.

531
00:33:56,749 --> 00:34:01,127
- Jesus, Dad!
- Go wash. Go wash.

532
00:34:01,171 --> 00:34:03,842
- I touched him.
- In the bathroom.

533
00:34:03,883 --> 00:34:06,800
- How could you do that?
- I didn't. He did it.

534
00:34:06,844 --> 00:34:09,133
You're disgusting! Kids?

535
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,257
(# Rock)

536
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:31,117
That was a really good shot, Ben.
Really good.

537
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:47,638
What the hell?

538
00:34:53,103 --> 00:34:56,308
Hey! You gave her a class goose
with the pool cue.

539
00:34:56,358 --> 00:34:58,185
She's so cute.

540
00:34:59,571 --> 00:35:02,523
Violent but cute.
You got chalk right there.

541
00:35:03,949 --> 00:35:07,532
- Look, I'll be back in a minute.
- What about the bear dump?

542
00:35:07,578 --> 00:35:10,070
(Bears growling)

543
00:35:13,668 --> 00:35:17,713
(Chet) Hey, it's crowded. This is great.

544
00:35:17,756 --> 00:35:21,458
- (Ben) Yeah, Dad.
- A lot of people are hip to this.

545
00:35:21,511 --> 00:35:24,084
Oh, yeah. Hey!

546
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:29,975
Right. Look at those bears. Huh?

547
00:35:30,021 --> 00:35:33,020
Are you scared or what?
Look at the bears!

548
00:35:34,023 --> 00:35:36,646
- They're great, Dad.
- "They're great, Dad."

549
00:35:36,694 --> 00:35:39,400
You're gonna see some bears.

550
00:35:39,448 --> 00:35:41,736
- Dad?
- Shh, shh, shh.

551
00:35:44,953 --> 00:35:47,445
Here you go! A nice Zagnut.

552
00:35:49,041 --> 00:35:51,199
Yeah. Come on.

553
00:35:53,213 --> 00:35:55,418
Come on.

554
00:35:55,464 --> 00:35:57,920
Come on. More.

555
00:35:57,967 --> 00:36:00,673
Come on. Here's some more.

556
00:36:03,974 --> 00:36:06,726
Jeez. Boy, he likes those.

557
00:36:06,768 --> 00:36:08,892
Now we'll get some action.

558
00:36:09,981 --> 00:36:12,898
Big head on him. Ooh, boy.

559
00:36:12,942 --> 00:36:15,399
Easy, easy there. Easy.

560
00:36:16,487 --> 00:36:20,782
Come on, watch the paint job! Hey, shoo!

561
00:36:20,826 --> 00:36:23,828
Look at the size of those teeth. Whoo.

562
00:36:25,624 --> 00:36:28,790
- Hey! Shoo! Go on.
- Dad, I wouldn't do that.

563
00:36:28,834 --> 00:36:32,086
All right. Maybe you're right.
He's looking at us.

564
00:36:32,131 --> 00:36:36,211
He's not finished.
When he finishes, he'll go.

565
00:36:37,844 --> 00:36:41,012
- Pretty big bear.
- Very big.

566
00:36:41,057 --> 00:36:45,138
Just let him eat his candy bar
and shoo shoo shoo.

567
00:36:46,188 --> 00:36:48,429
Hi. How you doing?

568
00:36:50,442 --> 00:36:52,102
Whoo.

569
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:58,990
Oh, Jeez! All right, all right. OK.

570
00:36:59,034 --> 00:37:02,036
Erm, let me rethink this.

571
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,951
Hey! What the hell?

572
00:37:14,885 --> 00:37:17,258
All right.

573
00:37:17,305 --> 00:37:21,517
- I've told you I love you, right?
- Yeah.

574
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,801
Good.

575
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:28,561
- What do you say we call it a night?
- (Banging)

576
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:32,904
Holy Jeez! Oh, boy!
Oh, boy. We've started something.

577
00:37:32,948 --> 00:37:34,442
Erm...

578
00:37:34,491 --> 00:37:37,612
- Let's call it an evening.
- Yeah. I'm tired.

579
00:37:37,662 --> 00:37:41,113
- Me too. Yeah. Let's just go.
- Yeah.

580
00:37:41,165 --> 00:37:43,703
(Engine starts)

581
00:37:43,751 --> 00:37:46,955
- (Beeps horn)
- That didn't scare him, Dad.

582
00:37:47,005 --> 00:37:50,375
I'm, erm... gonna move now.
I'm moving now!

583
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:54,338
All right. I'll just drive out.

584
00:37:54,387 --> 00:37:58,718
He'll jump right off.
Don't you worry.

585
00:37:58,768 --> 00:38:02,980
Dad? Isn't it illegal to drive
with a bear on your hood?

586
00:38:03,022 --> 00:38:05,181
I don't know in this state, son.

587
00:38:05,233 --> 00:38:06,977
(Bear growling)

588
00:38:07,027 --> 00:38:09,779
(Chet) It's Yogi and Boo Boo in the flesh.

589
00:38:09,821 --> 00:38:12,492
I wish Ranger Smith
would get out here.

590
00:38:12,534 --> 00:38:16,068
- (Banging)
- Hey, easy on the roof, pal!

591
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,790
Should have brought Uncle Roman's car.

592
00:38:19,707 --> 00:38:21,785
(Whooping and laughter)

593
00:38:24,297 --> 00:38:26,372
Knock knock.

594
00:38:26,423 --> 00:38:29,959
You, er, didn't give me
a chance to apologize.

595
00:38:36,351 --> 00:38:39,353
- Can I sit down?
- I don't own the park.

596
00:38:40,439 --> 00:38:42,515
Oh.

597
00:38:44,152 --> 00:38:46,026
Look...

598
00:38:47,112 --> 00:38:49,354
- I just got here. I'm from...
- Chicago.

599
00:38:50,491 --> 00:38:53,066
- How did you know?
- It's no big trick.

600
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:57,414
You live in this town,
it becomes like second nature.

601
00:38:57,458 --> 00:39:02,037
- I guess I just met my first local.
- You don't know how local I am.

602
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,799
You know...

603
00:39:08,636 --> 00:39:10,345
It's a...

604
00:39:11,348 --> 00:39:14,552
It's a really beautiful town. I mean...

605
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:17,473
It's a hole in the earth.

606
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:21,733
Look, save your breath.
I'm not a tourist attraction.

607
00:39:25,823 --> 00:39:27,781
What did I do?

608
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:39,248
Hey, Dad.

609
00:39:39,296 --> 00:39:42,214
- How are you?
- What are you doing down here?

610
00:39:42,257 --> 00:39:45,591
Oh... getting a breath of night air.

611
00:39:48,264 --> 00:39:51,798
Hey... You want to take a spin
in the rowboat?

612
00:39:52,851 --> 00:39:54,929
- Now?
- What the hell?

613
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:57,388
- In the dark?
- We'll check out some stars.

614
00:39:57,441 --> 00:40:00,110
- I don't know.
- Let's do something.

615
00:40:00,152 --> 00:40:02,690
- Let's go.
- Dad...

616
00:40:02,738 --> 00:40:05,064
Come on. I'll let you row.

617
00:40:05,116 --> 00:40:07,239
- Oh, great.
- It'll be fun.

618
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,750
(Chet) Boy, what a beautiful sky.

619
00:40:13,792 --> 00:40:16,366
Smell that air. Isn't that something?

620
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,128
(Buck coughs)

621
00:40:18,172 --> 00:40:22,881
That's the city in your lungs.
You're getting the good air in now.

622
00:40:23,927 --> 00:40:27,926
One day, you'll be coming up here
with your kids.

623
00:40:27,974 --> 00:40:31,225
- Yeah. Maybe.
- I want to give you something.

624
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:35,268
You're not going to kiss me
in the boat under the moon?

625
00:40:35,316 --> 00:40:39,314
I'm not going to kiss you.
I want to give you my ring.

626
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:44,235
- Why?
- Why? Because...

627
00:40:44,285 --> 00:40:47,819
my father gave it to me
and I'm giving it to you.

628
00:40:47,871 --> 00:40:50,078
You're grown-up now. You deserve it.

629
00:40:50,124 --> 00:40:52,201
So, like, er...

630
00:40:53,295 --> 00:40:57,755
you and I coming to the woods
is like your father bringing you here?

631
00:40:57,799 --> 00:41:00,836
- Yeah. I guess so.
- Yeah. I understand.

632
00:41:02,512 --> 00:41:04,590
Thanks for the ring.

633
00:41:06,142 --> 00:41:08,219
(Chittering)

634
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:12,399
'Rocks on top of the cans.

635
00:41:12,441 --> 00:41:15,193
'That never works.

636
00:41:15,236 --> 00:41:17,987
'We'll just knock the cans over.'

637
00:41:18,029 --> 00:41:20,355
'Of course we will.

638
00:41:21,284 --> 00:41:26,741
'Can I stay up again and watch
the big guy rake up all the mess?'

639
00:41:59,993 --> 00:42:02,319
How are you doing... Cammie?

640
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:06,532
Can I help you?

641
00:42:06,584 --> 00:42:09,040
I don't know.
What's the house specialty?

642
00:42:10,839 --> 00:42:13,840
Where am I supposed to put the tray?

643
00:42:13,883 --> 00:42:17,716
Going by last night, I'm sure you can
think of some good places.

644
00:42:17,763 --> 00:42:20,799
I'm sorry. I was in kind of a bad mood.

645
00:42:21,725 --> 00:42:24,133
Don't worry. It's no big deal.

646
00:42:24,186 --> 00:42:28,020
That doesn't mean I didn't mean
what I said. It's true.

647
00:42:28,067 --> 00:42:32,978
Wait. You don't even know me.
How can you say that's true of me?

648
00:42:33,031 --> 00:42:35,521
- It's a safe assumption.
- (Man) Excuse me?

649
00:42:35,574 --> 00:42:39,442
- Can we get some service?
- I'll be right there. I gotta go.

650
00:42:39,495 --> 00:42:42,581
- What time do you finish work?
- Eight o'clock.

651
00:42:42,624 --> 00:42:44,700
Eight o'clock?

652
00:42:44,751 --> 00:42:47,622
And where are you
going to be after work?

653
00:42:47,671 --> 00:42:50,080
I'll be around.

654
00:42:50,133 --> 00:42:54,594
- Can I see you?
- Yeah. If you can find me.

655
00:43:21,334 --> 00:43:23,741
I got you. I got you!

656
00:43:32,888 --> 00:43:34,881
Come on, Chet!

657
00:43:34,932 --> 00:43:38,182
If you trail behind,
the Indians will get you!

658
00:43:38,227 --> 00:43:42,272
- Come on, honey.
- Uncle Roman, wait for Dad.

659
00:43:42,315 --> 00:43:44,806
Come on! Hurry up.

660
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:48,608
Watch out for those Wisconsin
rattlers and wild boar.

661
00:43:48,654 --> 00:43:51,573
(Connie) Honey, come on!

662
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:54,986
(Ben) Wait up, you guys.

663
00:43:55,955 --> 00:43:58,281
Come on. Whoa. Hey. Ow!

664
00:43:58,333 --> 00:44:01,369
Easy. All right. OK.

665
00:44:01,419 --> 00:44:04,670
OK. Have it your way. I'll just get off.

666
00:44:07,886 --> 00:44:11,834
You all right? OK.
We're walking. Come on.

667
00:44:13,015 --> 00:44:16,385
Come on, let's go. Hey!

668
00:44:16,436 --> 00:44:21,145
Easy, easy. Let's just walk back
to the stable, all right?

669
00:44:21,191 --> 00:44:25,689
I'm walking, you're walking.
Let's have a nice easy walk.

670
00:44:27,698 --> 00:44:32,990
All right. That was your last chance.
That's it. Have it your way.

671
00:44:34,706 --> 00:44:38,122
I don't want to do this
but you forced me to.

672
00:44:41,006 --> 00:44:45,667
I hate to do this to you.
I'm normally not a mean person but I...

673
00:44:46,594 --> 00:44:49,383
Hey! Come back, you son of a bitch!

674
00:44:50,473 --> 00:44:53,843
That baby I was riding
was a purebred -

675
00:44:53,894 --> 00:44:55,970
purebred mule horse!

676
00:44:57,232 --> 00:45:01,526
- You rode it like it was.
- That baby was bred for packing.

677
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:04,736
- You looked great on that horse.
- Here he comes.

678
00:45:04,781 --> 00:45:07,865
Where is he? Hi, honey.

679
00:45:07,909 --> 00:45:11,611
(Roman) He's lost his mount.
How are you doing, trouper?

680
00:45:11,664 --> 00:45:14,997
Where's that ball-slappin' nag
you were riding?

681
00:45:15,042 --> 00:45:17,829
- (Connie) He looks the worse for wear.
- OK, Dad?

682
00:45:17,878 --> 00:45:20,667
- I'm OK.
- Did that horse buck you off?

683
00:45:20,716 --> 00:45:24,714
What happened? You got hungry
and had to eat the nag, huh?

684
00:45:24,762 --> 00:45:26,635
- Let's go home.
- What?

685
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,674
- Go home.
- Home?

686
00:45:28,725 --> 00:45:31,394
- We've got the whole day planned!
- A nap.

687
00:45:31,436 --> 00:45:33,144
- Come on!
- Oh, yeah.

688
00:45:33,188 --> 00:45:37,055
- Come on!
- I'm fine. It was OK.

689
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:10,142
I know musky's the big deal fish
in these waters

690
00:46:10,186 --> 00:46:12,512
but come with me
off the coast of Virginia,

691
00:46:12,565 --> 00:46:15,935
I'll let you hook into
a thousand-pound blue marlin

692
00:46:15,986 --> 00:46:19,354
and you'll know what fishing's
all about with a capital F!

693
00:46:19,405 --> 00:46:23,700
Excuse him. After a few cocktails,
he's an expert on everything.

694
00:46:23,744 --> 00:46:27,195
- Was that a shot?
- No, that was the truth.

695
00:46:27,247 --> 00:46:29,953
- That was a shot.
- That was a shot.

696
00:46:30,001 --> 00:46:32,288
Speaking of shots, set us up!

697
00:46:34,255 --> 00:46:36,213
- This guy's a riot.
- Isn't he?

698
00:46:36,257 --> 00:46:38,880
- Everybody loves him, right?
- Oh, yeah.

699
00:46:38,928 --> 00:46:41,762
You make a lot of tips on this job?

700
00:46:41,805 --> 00:46:44,593
- I do all right.
- Who handles your investments?

701
00:46:44,642 --> 00:46:47,134
My wife's got some egg money
put aside

702
00:46:47,187 --> 00:46:49,808
but she won't give it up to me.

703
00:46:49,856 --> 00:46:52,643
I'll take her number, I'll change that.

704
00:46:52,692 --> 00:46:55,019
That's what I do - investments.

705
00:46:55,071 --> 00:46:57,063
How you doing?

706
00:46:57,114 --> 00:47:01,694
Well, it-it-it-it-it-it
ain't-ain't r-r-r-raining.

707
00:47:01,745 --> 00:47:06,655
- It ain't r-r-r-raining, so t-t-that's good.
- Yeah. I guess so.

708
00:47:06,707 --> 00:47:09,626
- You fellas met Reg?
- I don't think so.

709
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:13,336
How you doing? Roman Craig.
Pleased to meet you.

710
00:47:13,383 --> 00:47:17,048
Er, Chet Ripley. How do you do?

711
00:47:17,095 --> 00:47:19,502
That's quite a hairdo you got.

712
00:47:19,555 --> 00:47:21,679
- A neo-skunk thing?
- Roman!

713
00:47:21,725 --> 00:47:24,181
- The hair!
- You don't have to say it.

714
00:47:24,228 --> 00:47:27,596
His hair turned white
cos lightning hit him.

715
00:47:28,481 --> 00:47:31,982
He's been struck by lightning...
How many times, Reg?

716
00:47:32,028 --> 00:47:35,610
S-S-S-Six...

717
00:47:35,656 --> 00:47:36,901
Six times?

718
00:47:36,949 --> 00:47:40,117
S-S-Six...

719
00:47:40,162 --> 00:47:42,238
Sixty-six times.

720
00:47:42,289 --> 00:47:46,369
In-n-n...

721
00:47:46,418 --> 00:47:47,961
the head!

722
00:47:48,004 --> 00:47:50,755
Sixty-six times?

723
00:47:52,342 --> 00:47:55,129
God! That's gotta hurt.

724
00:47:55,178 --> 00:47:59,555
You'll never meet a guy more tuned in
to the barometric pressure than Reg.

725
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:05,604
Yeah. You see him running like hell
for home, head for cover. Right, Reg?

726
00:48:05,649 --> 00:48:08,732
Hey, you pay. I gotta go to the john.

727
00:48:08,776 --> 00:48:11,398
Introduce Mr. Thick Dick
to Mr. Urinal Cake.

728
00:48:11,446 --> 00:48:13,688
Jeez, Roman! Do you have to?

729
00:48:13,742 --> 00:48:18,237
What I really want to say is...
thank you.

730
00:48:18,287 --> 00:48:20,743
This is very important
to Roman and me.

731
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:24,491
- I miss you, Connie.
- Oh, honey!

732
00:48:28,132 --> 00:48:30,622
It's so lonely being wealthy.

733
00:48:30,675 --> 00:48:32,799
Hm. I wouldn't know about that.

734
00:48:32,845 --> 00:48:37,341
No, I mean it, honey.
I mean it, it is lonely.

735
00:48:37,392 --> 00:48:40,725
He works terrible hours. Travels.

736
00:48:42,147 --> 00:48:45,149
We go a month
without going to bed together.

737
00:48:46,151 --> 00:48:48,393
Really? A month? That long?

738
00:48:48,445 --> 00:48:50,071
Mm-hm.

739
00:48:50,115 --> 00:48:54,492
I get pleasure by leaning against
the washer during the spin cycle.

740
00:48:56,329 --> 00:48:59,699
- Does that work?
- Have you ever seen whiter whites?

741
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:02,122
(Kate giggling)

742
00:49:05,589 --> 00:49:09,837
- When do you go back to Chicago?
- Erm, three days.

743
00:49:12,263 --> 00:49:16,262
I've never had a boyfriend
for longer than two weeks.

744
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:20,854
- Get outta here.
- That's why I was such a bitch.

745
00:49:20,899 --> 00:49:23,567
- No, you weren't a bitch.
- Yes, I was.

746
00:49:23,609 --> 00:49:25,685
It's no big deal.

747
00:49:25,736 --> 00:49:28,857
I don't understand
what I'm doing here.

748
00:49:30,993 --> 00:49:33,663
Look, I've never even had a girlfriend.

749
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:38,656
I've dated girls
but never one I'd call my girlfriend.

750
00:49:39,711 --> 00:49:43,211
- What would you call me?
- Officially?

751
00:49:48,094 --> 00:49:49,470
Girlfriend?

752
00:49:50,932 --> 00:49:54,467
And you're leaving in three days.
See what I mean?

753
00:49:54,519 --> 00:49:56,475
Yeah.

754
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:59,191
- Well?
- Well what?

755
00:50:14,499 --> 00:50:17,121
(Woman screaming)

756
00:50:19,754 --> 00:50:23,171
- What? What?
- It touched me!

757
00:50:23,217 --> 00:50:25,756
It's been touching you for 12 years.

758
00:50:25,804 --> 00:50:27,842
- Not you!
- What?

759
00:50:27,888 --> 00:50:29,680
- A thing.
- What thing?

760
00:50:29,723 --> 00:50:33,260
What's going on for God's sakes?
What is it?

761
00:50:33,312 --> 00:50:35,684
That thing!

762
00:50:37,983 --> 00:50:40,226
That's just a little sparrow.

763
00:50:40,278 --> 00:50:42,401
Come on, Roman, it's got ears.

764
00:50:42,447 --> 00:50:44,689
Jesus!

765
00:50:44,741 --> 00:50:47,447
(All yelling)

766
00:50:47,495 --> 00:50:50,661
Jesus, it's a tiny flying mouse,
not a bear.

767
00:50:50,706 --> 00:50:52,995
I am not going back in till it's out.

768
00:50:53,042 --> 00:50:55,414
- We'll get it out. Chet.
- What?

769
00:50:55,461 --> 00:50:59,839
Get a shovel, go in there
and get that radar-guided vermin.

770
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,631
- Why me?
- It's your cabin. We didn't order bats.

771
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:07,171
- You stay here too.
- You're the hosts.

772
00:51:07,224 --> 00:51:09,930
- So what?
- Stop fighting and go kill it.

773
00:51:09,978 --> 00:51:12,266
- We don't have to kill it.
- Kill it!

774
00:51:12,313 --> 00:51:16,014
- It didn't do anything.
- It attacked me.

775
00:51:16,067 --> 00:51:18,606
He's wimping out. I'll take care of it.

776
00:51:18,654 --> 00:51:22,603
I am not wimping, I'm thinking.
There's a big difference.

777
00:51:22,658 --> 00:51:25,231
If you want me to take care of it, I will.

778
00:51:25,286 --> 00:51:30,197
I'm just wondering who's gonna do it.
I'll do it. I'd like to get some sleep.

779
00:51:31,167 --> 00:51:33,243
Afraid of a little bat.

780
00:51:40,887 --> 00:51:43,673
- So?
- It buzzed me.

781
00:51:43,722 --> 00:51:48,136
We need a plan. It's bigger than
I thought. It's about a two-pounder.

782
00:51:48,186 --> 00:51:50,559
- Two-pounder?
- Yeah, big wings.

783
00:51:50,606 --> 00:51:53,442
- It's got the teeth. Frightening.
- Wow.

784
00:51:54,401 --> 00:51:57,402
I think we have to do something.

785
00:51:57,446 --> 00:52:00,982
What we need, Roman - big plan.
That's what we need.

786
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:12,330
We'll have this baby
squealing Mayday by midnight.

787
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:14,373
Let's split up.

788
00:52:20,639 --> 00:52:22,715
- You see him?
- He's hiding.

789
00:52:22,766 --> 00:52:26,810
Turn out the lights. He's nocturnal.
He'll think it's daytime like this.

790
00:52:26,853 --> 00:52:28,930
Good point.

791
00:52:32,068 --> 00:52:35,853
- Have you got him?
- Come on, you sonar-guided rodent.

792
00:52:36,949 --> 00:52:42,156
- Connie, bats carry rabies, don't they?
- Yeah, among other things.

793
00:52:42,204 --> 00:52:44,446
I'm gonna call him now.

794
00:52:44,499 --> 00:52:46,327
OK, just be still.

795
00:52:46,377 --> 00:52:49,329
(Kissing sounds)

796
00:52:49,378 --> 00:52:52,962
- Are you kissing him or calling him?
- I'm calling him!

797
00:52:53,008 --> 00:52:56,129
- That's the sound they make.
- OK, OK.

798
00:52:57,096 --> 00:53:00,097
(Both shouting)

799
00:53:01,726 --> 00:53:04,929
(All shouting at once)

800
00:53:04,979 --> 00:53:07,222
- Dad!
- Oh, no...

801
00:53:09,484 --> 00:53:11,773
(Roman) I got him!

802
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:17,778
Keep back.

803
00:53:17,828 --> 00:53:21,446
- Get the light on him.
- Keep your eye on the bat.

804
00:53:21,498 --> 00:53:23,206
Whoa!

805
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:25,456
Look at that thing move!

806
00:53:26,546 --> 00:53:28,454
(Screams)

807
00:53:28,505 --> 00:53:30,546
Christ Almighty!

808
00:53:30,592 --> 00:53:32,584
Ooh, I hit my head.

809
00:53:32,635 --> 00:53:34,510
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

810
00:53:34,555 --> 00:53:37,175
He's in the rafters. Where are you?

811
00:53:37,223 --> 00:53:39,264
I'm here!

812
00:53:39,310 --> 00:53:41,516
- He's on my face!
- Hold still!

813
00:53:42,688 --> 00:53:45,393
- (Chet groaning)
- Honey...

814
00:53:45,441 --> 00:53:47,434
We got it!

815
00:53:47,486 --> 00:53:50,570
- We got it!
- Oh, the pain.

816
00:53:50,614 --> 00:53:53,863
- (Roman) We got it!
- Ooh, that had to hurt.

817
00:53:55,452 --> 00:53:59,829
What a fighter.
Boy, he was something. I salute him.

818
00:54:01,459 --> 00:54:04,163
But we got to get some sleep.

819
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:07,209
(All groan)

820
00:54:15,724 --> 00:54:17,384
Hey.

821
00:54:17,434 --> 00:54:20,389
- Glad to see you.
- What time do you get off work?

822
00:54:20,438 --> 00:54:22,977
- Eight.
- Great. I'll meet you at nine.

823
00:54:23,025 --> 00:54:26,358
- Where?
- I don't know! You live here.

824
00:54:26,402 --> 00:54:29,654
- Erm, the bait shop?
- Sure.

825
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:31,775
I'll buy you some worms.

826
00:54:32,869 --> 00:54:37,163
- You wanna ditch me?
- Wait a second. Why would I ditch you?

827
00:54:37,207 --> 00:54:40,457
I don't know.
I'm just waiting for it to happen.

828
00:54:40,502 --> 00:54:42,162
If I ditch you,

829
00:54:42,212 --> 00:54:46,128
you have my permission never
to speak to me for as long as we live.

830
00:54:46,176 --> 00:54:48,297
- Promise?
- Promise.

831
00:54:55,394 --> 00:54:57,516
I got to go.

832
00:54:57,562 --> 00:54:59,852
- See you later.
- Bye.

833
00:55:02,777 --> 00:55:06,063
(Chet) Yeah, that should do it.
(Connie) Good idea.

834
00:55:06,114 --> 00:55:10,360
I'll have the Royal Canadian Mounted
beef barley soup.

835
00:55:10,409 --> 00:55:13,862
- Ooh, yeah.
- And then that bucket of salad.

836
00:55:13,914 --> 00:55:17,450
- I'll split that with you.
- You will? That would help.

837
00:55:17,502 --> 00:55:20,039
And then the medley of perch.

838
00:55:20,087 --> 00:55:23,042
That's my favorite. OK.

839
00:55:23,091 --> 00:55:26,626
Miss, what's the Old '96er?

840
00:55:26,678 --> 00:55:30,462
That's our world-famous
Paul Bunyan's blue ox steak.

841
00:55:30,516 --> 00:55:33,636
It is a 96-ounce prime-aged beef steak

842
00:55:33,686 --> 00:55:38,100
and if any member of your party
orders the Old '96er and finishes,

843
00:55:38,150 --> 00:55:40,226
everybody eats for free.

844
00:55:40,277 --> 00:55:44,061
- Not bad, huh?
- Wanna go for it, girls?

845
00:55:44,114 --> 00:55:47,235
- How about you, Chet?
- (Waitress) People like it.

846
00:55:47,285 --> 00:55:51,117
- I'll try it. What the heck?
- Has anybody ever eaten one?

847
00:55:51,163 --> 00:55:55,114
Oh... no. Not in my lifetime, no.

848
00:56:17,235 --> 00:56:19,274
Bon apptit.

849
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:20,862
Oh, good God.

850
00:56:22,949 --> 00:56:25,439
(Man) Let's check it out.

851
00:57:02,910 --> 00:57:05,484
How is he?

852
00:57:05,539 --> 00:57:07,577
(Rumbling)

853
00:57:07,622 --> 00:57:11,704
That's good. Processing very nicely.
All right, continue.

854
00:57:11,753 --> 00:57:13,912
(Excited chatter)

855
00:57:28,271 --> 00:57:30,845
- All right.
- I did it!

856
00:57:36,531 --> 00:57:39,696
- That just about does it.
- He's not done yet.

857
00:57:39,741 --> 00:57:42,827
He may take a while
with that last bite but it'll go.

858
00:57:42,870 --> 00:57:45,541
- That ain't the last bite.
- Sure it is.

859
00:57:45,583 --> 00:57:48,500
There's nothing left but gristle and fat.

860
00:57:50,087 --> 00:57:52,625
- Oh, God, no.
- No problem.

861
00:57:52,673 --> 00:57:55,378
(Roman) If I can get a dessert down him,

862
00:57:55,426 --> 00:57:58,428
can we get some
Paul Bunyan hats for the kids?

863
00:57:58,472 --> 00:58:01,425
- (Woman) Bye.
- (Applause)

864
00:58:03,977 --> 00:58:05,436
Mom, can I go now?

865
00:58:05,479 --> 00:58:08,516
They'll be telling their grandkids
about this.

866
00:58:08,566 --> 00:58:10,772
(Roman) What a night!

867
00:58:10,818 --> 00:58:12,811
Where's he going?

868
00:58:12,862 --> 00:58:17,027
That Jimbo's not a bad guy.
I just had a word with him out back.

869
00:58:19,035 --> 00:58:21,076
(Chittering) 'Where're the garbage cans?'

870
00:58:21,122 --> 00:58:23,742
'He probably put them in the cabin.'

871
00:58:23,790 --> 00:58:25,369
'Garbage in the cabin?'

872
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:29,119
'They're not the cleanest species
on the face of the earth, you know.

873
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:32,008
'It's not a problem.
We'll just have to break in.'

874
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:33,959
'Can we do that?'

875
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:37,047
'What do you think we have these
wonderfully articulate fingers for?

876
00:58:37,097 --> 00:58:39,091
'To scratch our asses!'

877
00:58:52,656 --> 00:58:54,732
Shit!

878
00:59:12,513 --> 00:59:15,264
- Oh, my God.
- Jesus.

879
00:59:15,306 --> 00:59:18,842
(Roman) Look at the size of the maggots
on that meat.

880
00:59:21,522 --> 00:59:23,598
Oh, honey!

881
00:59:26,695 --> 00:59:28,935
(Chet retching)

882
00:59:28,987 --> 00:59:31,111
(All screaming)

883
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:33,908
Oh, my God.

884
00:59:35,288 --> 00:59:38,536
(Chet) Let's go everybody.
Move it out. It's 5am.

885
00:59:38,581 --> 00:59:40,658
Fishing boat goes in 15 minutes.

886
00:59:40,709 --> 00:59:43,035
(All groaning)

887
00:59:44,464 --> 00:59:46,503
These are the biggest worms ever.

888
00:59:46,549 --> 00:59:50,879
(Chet) They're leeches.
(Buck) I am not touching leeches!

889
00:59:50,929 --> 00:59:53,800
- They don't bite.
- (Ben) No, they suck blood.

890
00:59:53,849 --> 00:59:57,634
(Chet) Would you watch the hook?!
Where's the flashlight?

891
00:59:57,687 --> 01:00:00,437
(Roman) Behind you.
You owe me big for this!

892
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,557
(Big splash, Roman laughing)

893
01:00:02,608 --> 01:00:04,685
(Chet) Very funny.

894
01:00:04,736 --> 01:00:08,485
Give me a leech, will you?
Has everybody got their leech?

895
01:00:08,532 --> 01:00:11,948
All right, on the count of three,
insert your hook.

896
01:00:11,994 --> 01:00:15,198
One, two, three.

897
01:00:15,248 --> 01:00:17,406
(All groan)

898
01:00:21,129 --> 01:00:23,253
(Snoring)

899
01:00:25,217 --> 01:00:27,294
(Thunder rumbles)

900
01:00:29,764 --> 01:00:32,219
(All screaming)

901
01:00:47,284 --> 01:00:49,157
May I speak with Cammie?

902
01:00:49,202 --> 01:00:51,741
Hold on just a minute. Cammie, phone.

903
01:00:53,666 --> 01:00:56,619
Cammie's really busy,
may I take a message?

904
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:01,585
All right, just tell her that Buck called.

905
01:01:01,633 --> 01:01:03,921
OK, fine, Buck. Goodbye.

906
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:19,902
- What are you up to?
- What's it look like?

907
01:01:19,944 --> 01:01:24,157
- It looks like you're wanking your crank.
- I'm trying to build a fire.

908
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:26,820
You'll never get a fire going that way.

909
01:01:26,868 --> 01:01:30,320
You don't crumple a newspaper up,
you twist it,

910
01:01:30,373 --> 01:01:33,375
lengthwise, to simulate kindling.

911
01:01:34,586 --> 01:01:38,963
Maybe, Roman, just maybe,
I'm trying to heat up the flue.

912
01:01:40,133 --> 01:01:44,879
He's heating the flue. Meanwhile,
the humans are freezing to death.

913
01:01:44,930 --> 01:01:49,225
- I'm really not cold. Not at all.
- Thank you for sharing that.

914
01:01:49,268 --> 01:01:52,803
I'm so sorry, Roman. Forgive me.

915
01:01:52,856 --> 01:01:55,811
Why don't you come over
and show me how to do it?

916
01:01:55,860 --> 01:01:58,693
You talk a great game,
let's see some action.

917
01:01:58,736 --> 01:02:03,400
After all, you know everything.
You always know exactly what to do.

918
01:02:03,451 --> 01:02:07,152
Katie, you were right,
we should have gone to Europe

919
01:02:07,205 --> 01:02:09,577
or Antarctica or the Dead Sea.

920
01:02:09,624 --> 01:02:12,080
We would have had more fun.

921
01:02:12,127 --> 01:02:17,086
Is that a fact? Nobody forced you
to come up here, buddy boy.

922
01:02:17,133 --> 01:02:21,428
As a matter of fact,
I don't remember anybody inviting you.

923
01:02:21,471 --> 01:02:23,463
Do you remember inviting him?

924
01:02:25,099 --> 01:02:27,770
I sure as hell don't.

925
01:02:27,812 --> 01:02:32,557
- And what does that statement mean?
- You figure it out for yourself.

926
01:02:32,608 --> 01:02:37,188
You specify, you clarify for me.
Just as a common courtesy.

927
01:02:37,239 --> 01:02:42,196
- You know what he means.
- They're saying we're not welcome.

928
01:02:42,243 --> 01:02:45,944
Oh! What did I hear? We've got a bingo!

929
01:02:45,997 --> 01:02:48,834
You did figure it out, Kate.

930
01:02:48,877 --> 01:02:53,621
So, now it's all starting to ooze out.
It's very interesting, isn't it?

931
01:02:53,673 --> 01:02:55,215
Yeah, very.

932
01:02:55,258 --> 01:02:59,968
Especially since we threw aside our
plans, and we had a great trip planned,

933
01:03:00,014 --> 01:03:02,386
to come up here
to show these dead-asses

934
01:03:02,433 --> 01:03:05,221
how to start to learn to have a good time.

935
01:03:05,270 --> 01:03:07,843
Thanks for ruining my vacation.

936
01:03:08,939 --> 01:03:13,518
What was that? Ruining your vacation?
Is that what you said?

937
01:03:13,569 --> 01:03:18,992
Oh, come on, I don't believe
I heard you say that.

938
01:03:19,035 --> 01:03:22,285
- You'd better believe it.
- Don't push it.

939
01:03:22,330 --> 01:03:26,576
You ain't even seen pushing yet.
The trouble with you, Ripley,

940
01:03:26,625 --> 01:03:29,877
is you wouldn't know a good time
if it fell on you.

941
01:03:29,922 --> 01:03:31,832
(Sighs)

942
01:03:31,883 --> 01:03:35,001
You got an awful lot of nerve,
a lot of nerve.

943
01:03:35,051 --> 01:03:38,422
It's served me well.
I'm the one with the Mercedes.

944
01:03:38,473 --> 01:03:40,715
By the way, is it paid for?

945
01:03:40,767 --> 01:03:43,887
- Are you jealous, Chester?
- Don't call me Chester.

946
01:03:43,937 --> 01:03:47,141
Call me that and you'll go home
with a dent in your forehead.

947
01:03:47,191 --> 01:03:51,770
- Yeah, that'll be the day.
- Would you like one to match his?

948
01:03:51,821 --> 01:03:55,571
- You wanna go right now?
- Dad, no one's denting anybody.

949
01:03:55,618 --> 01:03:59,033
- Thanks, Bucky.
- Bite the big one, Uncle Roman.

950
01:03:59,079 --> 01:04:01,451
- Don't talk to adults that way.
- Why not?

951
01:04:01,498 --> 01:04:04,950
- Because it's rude.
- Oh, blow it out your ass.

952
01:04:05,002 --> 01:04:08,288
- Let's go. Come on, girls.
- (Roman) Good idea.

953
01:04:08,339 --> 01:04:12,419
(Chet) It's the first good idea you've had
since you've been here.

954
01:04:12,468 --> 01:04:14,675
And don't steal any of our stuff.

955
01:04:14,721 --> 01:04:18,137
- Ha! What stuff is there to steal?
- We got stuff!

956
01:04:18,183 --> 01:04:22,929
- You're a louse.
- Well, go find yourself a spin cycle.

957
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:25,651
Yeah, go find yourself a spin cycle.

958
01:04:26,527 --> 01:04:30,358
- What does that mean?
- Never mind.

959
01:04:30,405 --> 01:04:33,989
- Dad?
- Yes, Ben.

960
01:04:34,035 --> 01:04:37,653
Does this mean we won't get
a present from Uncle Roman?

961
01:04:37,706 --> 01:04:39,863
Blow it out your ass.

962
01:04:39,915 --> 01:04:42,752
Nobody's blowing anything
out their ass.

963
01:04:42,795 --> 01:04:47,706
It's just a little problem, it doesn't mean
we don't love your uncle and aunt,

964
01:04:47,758 --> 01:04:50,428
it just means
we are having some emotions.

965
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:54,549
What it means is that I'd like
to blow Uncle Roman out my ass.

966
01:04:54,598 --> 01:04:59,011
I don't want any more about
anyone blowing anything out their ass.

967
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:02,976
You might as well
blow the whole family out your ass, Dad.

968
01:05:03,024 --> 01:05:07,402
Do you understand what's going on?
You understand what we're saying?

969
01:05:07,446 --> 01:05:09,902
Aunt Kate and Uncle Roman
are buttheads.

970
01:05:09,949 --> 01:05:11,148
Exactly.

971
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:27,296
All right, troops, mount up.
We're ready to roll.

972
01:05:27,343 --> 01:05:31,507
- You all packed?
- Actually, I was thinking things over.

973
01:05:31,556 --> 01:05:35,934
And I'm gonna tell you something
I had previously decided not to.

974
01:05:35,978 --> 01:05:38,053
I came up here for a reason.

975
01:05:39,607 --> 01:05:42,644
I came here to talk to you
about an investment.

976
01:05:42,694 --> 01:05:46,525
In fact, I came up to solicit
$25,000 from you.

977
01:05:46,572 --> 01:05:49,610
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it.

978
01:05:49,660 --> 01:05:53,030
Look, a unique investment opportunity
came my way

979
01:05:53,081 --> 01:05:57,458
and I'm thinking of people
that I'm gonna bless with this chance

980
01:05:57,502 --> 01:06:00,171
cos this is so good it should be illegal.

981
01:06:00,213 --> 01:06:02,751
- And it probably is.
- It's not.

982
01:06:02,799 --> 01:06:05,552
It's inside but it's not illegal.

983
01:06:05,595 --> 01:06:08,761
The upside is phenomenal,
the downside is zip.

984
01:06:08,806 --> 01:06:12,851
I'm thinking about who I could involve
in this and your name came up.

985
01:06:12,894 --> 01:06:16,098
Why? Because you are family.

986
01:06:16,148 --> 01:06:19,018
If a guy can't help his family,
what good is he?

987
01:06:19,067 --> 01:06:22,769
I came up here to offer you a chance
to make some big money.

988
01:06:22,822 --> 01:06:25,657
It's funny you didn't mention this before.

989
01:06:25,699 --> 01:06:29,532
- You didn't want to talk about money.
- Baloney!

990
01:06:29,579 --> 01:06:33,577
(Roman) I was picking my moment.
(Chet) You were picking your nose.

991
01:06:35,710 --> 01:06:38,084
There's no mystery here, Chet.

992
01:06:38,130 --> 01:06:41,250
- I know how you really feel about me.
- Do you?

993
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:43,127
Yep.

994
01:06:43,177 --> 01:06:46,962
I knew if I gave you something,
you'd figure there'd be strings.

995
01:06:47,015 --> 01:06:49,850
- Is that a fact?
- Yeah, that's a fact.

996
01:06:51,811 --> 01:06:53,889
At our wedding...

997
01:06:54,983 --> 01:06:59,858
you were in the john, with Kate
and Connie's dad, you were talking.

998
01:06:59,904 --> 01:07:04,483
Do you happen to remember
the substance of that conversation?

999
01:07:04,534 --> 01:07:07,026
- No, I don't.
- Well, I do.

1000
01:07:08,205 --> 01:07:10,577
It's one I'll never forget

1001
01:07:10,624 --> 01:07:14,669
because I heard you say, and I quote,

1002
01:07:14,712 --> 01:07:18,378
"That Roman Craig
is a crooked son of a bitch."

1003
01:07:18,425 --> 01:07:23,466
The next time you stab somebody in
the back, check under the stalls for feet.

1004
01:07:23,513 --> 01:07:29,351
You may think I'm made out of armor
but I'm just like any other human being

1005
01:07:29,395 --> 01:07:32,396
and when I get cut it hurts
and that cut me.

1006
01:07:32,439 --> 01:07:34,682
And I hurt.

1007
01:07:36,527 --> 01:07:39,019
Roman, I'm...

1008
01:07:39,073 --> 01:07:41,149
I'm sorry, I...

1009
01:07:42,244 --> 01:07:45,611
I had a lot to drink that night and, er...

1010
01:07:45,662 --> 01:07:49,115
I really don't remember saying that
but if you said I did...

1011
01:07:50,837 --> 01:07:53,291
then...

1012
01:07:53,338 --> 01:07:55,580
I must have.

1013
01:07:57,426 --> 01:08:01,092
I apologize to you both.
It was a terrible thing to say.

1014
01:08:03,642 --> 01:08:07,306
I don't hold grudges
and I don't have any hard feelings.

1015
01:08:07,353 --> 01:08:09,596
To show you I can forgive and forget,

1016
01:08:09,648 --> 01:08:13,481
I'd still like to offer you
a piece of that investment.

1017
01:08:15,654 --> 01:08:17,612
Sweetie.

1018
01:08:18,908 --> 01:08:21,910
I don't know what to say, Roman, I...

1019
01:08:21,954 --> 01:08:24,029
I feel like a real idiot.

1020
01:08:25,123 --> 01:08:29,121
- What is this thing?
- 25,000. What's your cash position?

1021
01:08:31,797 --> 01:08:34,835
It isn't 25,000,
that's an awful lot of money.

1022
01:08:34,885 --> 01:08:37,506
Can you get it?

1023
01:08:37,554 --> 01:08:39,096
No!

1024
01:08:39,139 --> 01:08:45,013
I, er... I think I can make an arrangement
or two at the bank on Monday.

1025
01:08:45,063 --> 01:08:47,138
Look, whatever you want to do.

1026
01:08:47,189 --> 01:08:51,816
You can write a cheque now
and I'll make up the difference.

1027
01:08:51,861 --> 01:08:55,112
If that's OK?
Is your chequebook in the purse?

1028
01:08:55,156 --> 01:08:58,691
- Yeah.
- (Chet) Great. Then that's fine.

1029
01:09:05,210 --> 01:09:07,250
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

1030
01:09:07,296 --> 01:09:11,127
I think it's a real testament
to the strength of the family

1031
01:09:11,174 --> 01:09:13,499
that we can disagree so vehemently

1032
01:09:13,552 --> 01:09:17,420
and get on each other's nerves so badly
over the past week

1033
01:09:17,474 --> 01:09:19,550
and still part on good terms.

1034
01:09:19,601 --> 01:09:21,676
Absolutely.

1035
01:09:22,938 --> 01:09:25,642
After all the disagreements you two had,

1036
01:09:25,690 --> 01:09:29,191
you still thought to include him
in that investment.

1037
01:09:29,236 --> 01:09:34,231
It was a wonderful moment of trust on
his part that he wrote you that cheque.

1038
01:09:34,283 --> 01:09:39,445
That's a lot of money for him. From what
I gather, it's half a year's salary.

1039
01:09:39,498 --> 01:09:42,866
It may well be
Ben and Buck's college money.

1040
01:09:42,917 --> 01:09:48,044
You have a knack with money and I think
it's great you're sharing it with him

1041
01:09:48,091 --> 01:09:50,297
and that he accepted your offer,

1042
01:09:50,343 --> 01:09:53,759
that he trusts you
with his financial well being.

1043
01:09:53,805 --> 01:09:57,637
Oh, I hope this investment
really works out for them.

1044
01:09:57,683 --> 01:09:59,179
(Tires screech)

1045
01:09:59,228 --> 01:10:03,440
- I got to go back.
- Did you forget something?

1046
01:10:03,482 --> 01:10:07,646
- You're scaring me, are you all right?
- I will be once I settle this.

1047
01:10:23,379 --> 01:10:25,918
(Kate) Roman, what are you doing?

1048
01:10:25,966 --> 01:10:28,337
- Katie, sit down.
- What?

1049
01:10:28,384 --> 01:10:31,801
You'll need to sit down
to hear what I have to say.

1050
01:10:33,725 --> 01:10:37,175
- Gee, it's wet.
- Hurry up.

1051
01:10:37,227 --> 01:10:39,185
Let's go.

1052
01:10:39,230 --> 01:10:44,605
Chet, I'm gonna level with you.
I'm a phony, a fraud, a fake.

1053
01:10:44,653 --> 01:10:49,861
From my imitation Bally slip-ons
to our replicated Rolexes.

1054
01:10:49,909 --> 01:10:53,408
We're broke. We're bankrupt.
We're busted.

1055
01:10:53,454 --> 01:10:55,531
We're busted?

1056
01:10:57,459 --> 01:11:00,626
We were living well, right?
Well beyond our means.

1057
01:11:02,255 --> 01:11:05,423
I haven't been trading in over two years.

1058
01:11:06,761 --> 01:11:09,631
This deal looked good,
I got overextended,

1059
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:14,142
couldn't meet my calls.
I lost my seat on the exchange.

1060
01:11:14,186 --> 01:11:16,759
I go to work every morning.

1061
01:11:16,814 --> 01:11:19,767
Now I wear a blue runner's jacket
and fetch coffee.

1062
01:11:19,816 --> 01:11:22,391
I lost everything.

1063
01:11:22,445 --> 01:11:25,362
Did you think
that I wouldn't understand?

1064
01:11:25,406 --> 01:11:27,981
Baby, I knew you'd understand

1065
01:11:28,035 --> 01:11:32,827
but I also knew you wouldn't let me
put the bite on Connie and Chet.

1066
01:11:32,872 --> 01:11:37,287
Look, Roman. You know I'd never
turn my back on family.

1067
01:11:37,337 --> 01:11:39,793
I know, that's why I came up here.

1068
01:11:40,714 --> 01:11:44,251
That story about you and your brother
in the can at the wedding,

1069
01:11:44,303 --> 01:11:46,461
I made it up.

1070
01:11:48,474 --> 01:11:52,424
You what? You made it up?

1071
01:12:00,864 --> 01:12:03,353
All right, all right. I got it, I got it.

1072
01:12:04,157 --> 01:12:06,151
Holy...

1073
01:12:07,036 --> 01:12:09,195
Holy jeez.

1074
01:12:10,999 --> 01:12:13,667
Whoo.

1075
01:12:13,709 --> 01:12:16,960
- (Groaning)
- (Connie) What happened?

1076
01:12:17,005 --> 01:12:20,457
- Power's out.
- Where's the flashlight?

1077
01:12:20,509 --> 01:12:23,261
- Chet?
- What happened to the lights?

1078
01:12:23,304 --> 01:12:25,427
You kids got the flashlight?

1079
01:12:25,473 --> 01:12:30,349
Look at this. $110 for a lighter,
it doesn't even work.

1080
01:12:30,395 --> 01:12:32,804
79 cents. Ha.

1081
01:12:32,857 --> 01:12:34,848
Whoo! Hot!

1082
01:12:34,899 --> 01:12:38,234
I haven't seen weather like this for years.

1083
01:12:40,574 --> 01:12:43,574
Roman, where are the girls?

1084
01:12:44,953 --> 01:12:47,159
Have you seen them?

1085
01:12:47,205 --> 01:12:49,282
- Have you seen them?
- No.

1086
01:12:49,334 --> 01:12:53,830
Spread out, let's look for them.
They'll be hiding under a bed.

1087
01:12:57,716 --> 01:13:02,179
- Come on, it's this way.
- No, it's this way. I remember.

1088
01:13:03,224 --> 01:13:05,429
That big hole.

1089
01:13:09,521 --> 01:13:12,607
- We'll find them.
- They're gonna be all right.

1090
01:13:12,651 --> 01:13:14,643
Don't worry about a thing.

1091
01:13:14,694 --> 01:13:17,897
Boys, stay here.
Look after your mother and aunt.

1092
01:13:17,947 --> 01:13:21,198
- We'll help you.
- There's too much lightning.

1093
01:13:21,243 --> 01:13:24,364
- We're near the cave.
- Here's the fence.

1094
01:13:25,707 --> 01:13:27,912
Wait for me.

1095
01:13:27,958 --> 01:13:30,876
Cara! Mara!

1096
01:13:33,507 --> 01:13:35,500
- Try this way.
- OK.

1097
01:13:35,551 --> 01:13:37,876
Thank you.

1098
01:13:38,970 --> 01:13:41,544
There we go. There we go.

1099
01:13:44,227 --> 01:13:47,015
We find the candles,
then the light comes back on.

1100
01:13:47,064 --> 01:13:49,601
I win.

1101
01:13:52,403 --> 01:13:57,361
- I found it. I wanna go first.
- No, I wanna. Me!

1102
01:13:57,408 --> 01:13:59,236
Hello!

1103
01:13:59,286 --> 01:14:01,158
(Both) Hello!

1104
01:14:02,204 --> 01:14:04,447
(Screaming)

1105
01:14:11,715 --> 01:14:15,796
- Cara! Mara!
- Girls!

1106
01:14:26,691 --> 01:14:29,645
- Cara!
- Mara!

1107
01:14:29,694 --> 01:14:32,611
Girls! Cara, Mara!

1108
01:14:37,703 --> 01:14:40,574
Cara! Mara!

1109
01:14:40,623 --> 01:14:43,375
Help!

1110
01:14:43,417 --> 01:14:45,659
Put your light up there.

1111
01:14:45,712 --> 01:14:47,835
There.

1112
01:14:48,882 --> 01:14:51,883
Girls, is that you?

1113
01:14:51,928 --> 01:14:54,714
It's Uncle Chet. Are you all right?

1114
01:14:54,763 --> 01:14:58,382
- Help!
- We'll be right down. Go on.

1115
01:14:58,434 --> 01:15:00,510
- Not me.
- What?

1116
01:15:00,561 --> 01:15:05,224
- I'm claustrophobic. What if I lose it?
- You won't lose it.

1117
01:15:05,275 --> 01:15:08,192
- What if I blow it?
- We gotta get some help.

1118
01:15:08,236 --> 01:15:11,237
(Chet) We don't have time. You can do it.

1119
01:15:11,281 --> 01:15:14,533
They're your children. Be their father.

1120
01:15:14,578 --> 01:15:18,028
For the first time in your life,
be their father.

1121
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:21,331
Come on. Get in there
and help your kids.

1122
01:15:24,171 --> 01:15:27,337
Your dad'll be right down.
Daddy's coming.

1123
01:15:27,382 --> 01:15:29,624
Let's go. You can do it.

1124
01:15:29,677 --> 01:15:32,347
- All right.
- Here we go.

1125
01:15:32,389 --> 01:15:35,804
I'm gonna go get a light
and some rope, OK?

1126
01:15:35,851 --> 01:15:38,602
All right? Take it easy.

1127
01:15:38,645 --> 01:15:43,556
Don't think about tight places
like a submarine or a coffin.

1128
01:15:43,609 --> 01:15:46,231
- Come back.
- I'll be back.

1129
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:57,750
No!

1130
01:16:00,836 --> 01:16:04,502
Oh. My little sweeties.

1131
01:16:04,549 --> 01:16:06,625
Oh, I love you.

1132
01:16:12,933 --> 01:16:17,062
Chet! They're all right!

1133
01:16:17,105 --> 01:16:19,893
Apollo unicell...

1134
01:16:20,859 --> 01:16:22,851
It's dynamite.

1135
01:16:22,902 --> 01:16:24,942
Wet, old dynamite.

1136
01:16:26,740 --> 01:16:29,197
It's fine. It's fine.

1137
01:16:29,244 --> 01:16:31,531
Chet. Chet!

1138
01:16:34,249 --> 01:16:36,621
Ripley.

1139
01:16:36,668 --> 01:16:39,586
OK, we want to get out of here.

1140
01:16:39,629 --> 01:16:43,710
It's cold, it's wet
and you don't want to stay here.

1141
01:16:43,759 --> 01:16:46,963
You hang on to Daddy
as tight as you can.

1142
01:16:48,264 --> 01:16:50,423
OK. Come on.

1143
01:16:51,519 --> 01:16:55,183
Ooh! Ah! Ooh! Big one. Big spider.

1144
01:16:55,230 --> 01:17:00,308
OK, climb on, Cara.
Mara, get on your sister's back.

1145
01:17:00,362 --> 01:17:04,193
Grab hold of my jacket. Hang on tight.

1146
01:17:06,951 --> 01:17:09,158
OK, my babies.

1147
01:17:21,260 --> 01:17:23,466
Which way?

1148
01:17:25,387 --> 01:17:28,389
Hang on, we're almost there.

1149
01:17:36,067 --> 01:17:38,190
Jeez, damn.

1150
01:17:38,236 --> 01:17:40,275
Come on.

1151
01:17:42,907 --> 01:17:45,281
Go, Cara. Go!

1152
01:17:58,424 --> 01:18:01,261
Let's go back to the cabin.

1153
01:18:02,847 --> 01:18:06,181
Your mother's probably
worried sick about you.

1154
01:18:08,186 --> 01:18:10,060
Here we go. OK.

1155
01:18:11,564 --> 01:18:14,056
Hang on. Hang on.

1156
01:18:15,653 --> 01:18:18,821
Roman, girls, I'm back.

1157
01:18:18,866 --> 01:18:21,153
I got everything. I'm here.

1158
01:18:21,199 --> 01:18:25,246
I'll have you out in a second.
Just a minute. Hold on.

1159
01:18:25,288 --> 01:18:28,574
I'm sorry it took so long. I'll explain later.

1160
01:18:29,626 --> 01:18:32,544
Just a sec. Get off me. I got a rope.

1161
01:18:33,047 --> 01:18:37,127
You'll be fine. I'm gonna tie a rope
at the end of this thing.

1162
01:18:37,176 --> 01:18:39,216
I'm gonna throw it down

1163
01:18:39,262 --> 01:18:43,758
and, one at a time, I'll pull you up, OK?

1164
01:18:43,808 --> 01:18:47,225
Here comes the rope. Watch your heads.

1165
01:18:47,271 --> 01:18:49,430
Here it comes.

1166
01:18:53,736 --> 01:18:56,691
All right, have you got it?

1167
01:18:58,909 --> 01:19:02,076
OK. You got it? Good.

1168
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:06,201
You let me know when
you're ready to come up, OK?

1169
01:19:06,250 --> 01:19:08,741
Then I'll pull you up.

1170
01:19:09,712 --> 01:19:11,753
Fine, you're ready.

1171
01:19:11,799 --> 01:19:13,707
Just a second.

1172
01:19:13,758 --> 01:19:18,634
OK, girls, Uncle Chet's here. OK.

1173
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:21,351
Roman, you could help, you know.

1174
01:19:21,393 --> 01:19:25,805
All right. One, two, three, go.

1175
01:19:27,690 --> 01:19:29,898
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

1176
01:19:31,027 --> 01:19:34,646
When I say ready, huh?
When I say ready.

1177
01:19:34,698 --> 01:19:37,189
All right. I'm ready.

1178
01:19:40,955 --> 01:19:43,625
Come on. Help out a bit, will you?

1179
01:19:45,376 --> 01:19:48,331
Here it comes.
We'll be going home soon.

1180
01:19:50,925 --> 01:19:54,044
Roman and I are going to
have a talk, later on.

1181
01:19:54,094 --> 01:19:57,298
We're going to talk about helping people.

1182
01:19:57,348 --> 01:20:01,181
OK. Here we go.
Everybody help Uncle Chet.

1183
01:20:01,228 --> 01:20:03,101
Come on.

1184
01:20:05,733 --> 01:20:08,734
We did it. I did it.

1185
01:20:18,830 --> 01:20:20,823
A baldheaded bear!

1186
01:20:20,874 --> 01:20:23,496
(Screams)

1187
01:20:41,355 --> 01:20:43,763
(Bear growls, Chet screams)

1188
01:20:48,947 --> 01:20:51,105
Whoa!

1189
01:20:51,157 --> 01:20:53,365
Nice bear. Oh, God.

1190
01:20:56,622 --> 01:20:59,196
I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die!

1191
01:20:59,250 --> 01:21:00,828
No, I'm not.

1192
01:21:00,877 --> 01:21:03,036
Leave me alone. Go away.

1193
01:21:03,088 --> 01:21:05,661
I gotta move faster.

1194
01:21:21,441 --> 01:21:23,814
He's back, everybody.

1195
01:21:24,903 --> 01:21:27,193
Chet! Hi.

1196
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:31,702
- Where the hell were you?
- Come in, I'm making you a sandwich.

1197
01:21:31,745 --> 01:21:34,200
Big, big, whoo big...

1198
01:21:34,247 --> 01:21:36,121
All right, we'll make a big one.

1199
01:21:36,166 --> 01:21:39,037
- Big bear.
- Big bear!

1200
01:21:39,086 --> 01:21:42,337
No! True. True. Out there.

1201
01:21:42,382 --> 01:21:44,837
We're glad you're home, honey.

1202
01:21:44,884 --> 01:21:48,087
- Big bear... chase...
- What is he saying?

1203
01:21:48,137 --> 01:21:50,890
- What?
- Big bear chase me.

1204
01:21:51,808 --> 01:21:53,553
(Growling)

1205
01:21:58,441 --> 01:22:02,486
Up the stairs! Get upstairs!
Oh, my God, it's a bear!

1206
01:22:04,406 --> 01:22:06,779
It's a bear, it's a bear!

1207
01:22:06,826 --> 01:22:09,280
Get off, you son of a bitch.

1208
01:22:10,871 --> 01:22:15,499
Roman! Roman! Wow! Wow!

1209
01:22:17,086 --> 01:22:19,209
Uncle, uncle, uncle.

1210
01:22:22,259 --> 01:22:24,881
Oh, my God. Protect us!

1211
01:22:24,929 --> 01:22:26,720
Hold on.

1212
01:22:28,181 --> 01:22:30,259
Mom.

1213
01:22:38,027 --> 01:22:40,695
Connie, stay down.

1214
01:22:51,875 --> 01:22:54,448
Hit him with the poker.

1215
01:23:00,802 --> 01:23:02,710
Look out!

1216
01:23:10,145 --> 01:23:12,850
Big bear... Big bear chase me.

1217
01:23:20,740 --> 01:23:22,863
This big.

1218
01:23:34,714 --> 01:23:38,546
- Thank God you're here.
- Shoot him.

1219
01:23:38,593 --> 01:23:41,879
- It's a goddamn lamp.
- But it's loaded.

1220
01:23:41,930 --> 01:23:44,053
I can't hold out much longer!

1221
01:23:44,099 --> 01:23:46,507
- Quit pushing me.
- Give it me.

1222
01:23:50,481 --> 01:23:51,810
Shoot him.

1223
01:23:53,651 --> 01:23:56,357
Oh! Right in the...

1224
01:23:56,405 --> 01:23:58,730
(Bear squealing)

1225
01:24:09,753 --> 01:24:12,079
(Squealing continues)

1226
01:24:13,757 --> 01:24:15,797
OK, let's roll.

1227
01:24:15,842 --> 01:24:18,714
Can't believe that I'm gonna
miss this place.

1228
01:24:18,763 --> 01:24:21,051
- Uncle Chet.
- Yes, sweetheart.

1229
01:24:21,098 --> 01:24:24,634
- I had a really good time.
- Well, I'm glad.

1230
01:24:24,687 --> 01:24:28,849
- Thanks, Uncle Chet.
- My pleasure, sweetheart.

1231
01:24:28,898 --> 01:24:32,435
We had a nice time having you.
We're gonna miss you.

1232
01:24:32,487 --> 01:24:35,857
Will I see you soon?
And don't drive too fast.

- Take your seats, in the trunk.
- (Kate) Knock it off.

1234
01:24:42,539 --> 01:24:45,660
Cammie, if you're out there...

1235
01:24:45,710 --> 01:24:50,004
I just want you to know
I don't blame you for hating me.

1236
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:53,381
(Cammie) City boys
always talk to themselves?

1237
01:24:59,724 --> 01:25:02,013
Look, I'm really sorry.

1238
01:25:02,060 --> 01:25:06,225
I want you to go back to Chicago
a crazed, lovesick maniac.

1239
01:25:06,274 --> 01:25:10,437
When you look at another girl,
you'll compare her to me.

1240
01:25:10,486 --> 01:25:12,812
Sounds good to me.

1241
01:25:17,745 --> 01:25:21,825
- You're a good man. You're the best.
- You're not so bad.

1242
01:25:23,333 --> 01:25:27,285
- You drive safely.
- Thanks.

1243
01:25:27,339 --> 01:25:29,878
- Race you home.
- You got it.

1244
01:25:31,801 --> 01:25:33,842
Race you home.

1245
01:25:35,264 --> 01:25:37,507
Take care.

1246
01:25:39,102 --> 01:25:41,307
Bye-bye.

1247
01:25:44,274 --> 01:25:46,647
Race you home.

1248
01:25:48,779 --> 01:25:52,113
Why would he say that?
He lives out in Oak Park.

1249
01:25:52,158 --> 01:25:54,364
It's just till he gets on his feet.

1250
01:25:54,410 --> 01:25:58,408
I think you should be proud of him
not taking your loan.

1251
01:25:58,456 --> 01:26:02,668
- What are you saying?
- We have plenty of room.

1252
01:26:02,710 --> 01:26:04,870
He is not staying at our house.

1253
01:26:04,922 --> 01:26:08,042
If he beats us, he'll get
the good spot in the garage.

1254
01:26:08,135 --> 01:26:11,254
- To the memories.
- To the memories.

1255
01:26:12,681 --> 01:26:14,922
- Chester!
- Buckley!

1256
01:26:14,974 --> 01:26:19,637
Get in the car, we've got to beat
Roman home. Move it.
