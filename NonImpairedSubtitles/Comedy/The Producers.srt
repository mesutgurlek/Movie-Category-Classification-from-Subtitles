1866
00:40:02,507 --> 00:40:06,010
who has taken
money from little
old ladies,

1867
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:09,514

talked people into

I know it's not
a big legal point,

1885
00:41:01,482 --> 00:41:05,987
but even in
kindergarten, they
used to call me Bloom.

1886
00:41:05,987 --> 00:41:07,989
I never sang
a song before.
