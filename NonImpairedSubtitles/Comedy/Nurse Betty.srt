1
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,258
Is it true you're a real doctor?

2
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,813
Definitively.

3
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,374
Here's the car.

4
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,052
Where are we going?

5
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,329
Don't you trust me?

6
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,256
No.

7
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,731
I don't trust anybody.

8
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,456
You still haven't said where?

9
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,216
So, what's your name, then?

10
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,014
Betty.

11
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,019
Short for Elizabeth?

12
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:03,697
Betty.

13
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,409
Where are we going?

14
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,617
To eat. Aren't you hungry?

15
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,653
I'm thirsty.

16
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,098
You can drink too.

17
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,295
You're all gray!

18
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,015
Gray?

19
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,337
Oh, yes, yes. I love gray.

20
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:25,132
We're going to a place
you don't know. It's very special.

21
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,376
It's near Versailles.

22
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,415
You smoke non-stop.

23
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,939
Non-stop.

24
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,739
2, 3 packs a day?

25
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,250
What do you care?

26
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,937
It's all the same to me.

27
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:47,378
But I'm a doctor. Didn't I tell you?

28
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,335
Yeah.

29
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,214
Twice already.

30
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,010
Do you like hare?

31
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,895
That's all they serve tonight.

32
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,256
It's cassoulet on Wednesdays.

33
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,773
Is it cassoulet?

34
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,854
Cassoulet... Yes, that's right.

35
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,449
It's cassoulet night.

36
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,253
Takes getting used to.

37
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,012
You either like it or you don't.

38
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,529
Here we are.

39
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,973
Come on.

40
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,617
It doesn't look so hot.

41
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,970
It has it's charm. You'll see.

42
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,849
It's weird...

43
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,095
"The Hole".

44
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,619
Yes, "The Hole".

45
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,339
The Hole.

46
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,933
The Hole.

47
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:03,739
Funny how they all ingest animals
and never wonder...

48
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,259
How are you, Doc?

49
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,569
You're not listening.

50
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,497
Yes, I am.

51
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,655
What did I say?

52
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,568
That by eating animals people...

53
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,018
Excuse me one moment.

54
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,214
The same?

55
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,336
Your first time in The Hole?

56
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,456
Yeah.

57
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,778
Known Doc long?

58
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,810
No.

59
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,058
Want something to eat?

60
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,052
I'm not hungry, thanks.

61
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:46,815
Make yourself at home.
Everybody here does.

62
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,696
Sorry to leave you alone.

63
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,498
They served refills.

64
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,334
Well done.

65
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,653
I'm still thirsty.

66
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,339
Joseph! A drink for the lady.

67
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,739
You have an itch?

68
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,569
What?

69
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,173
Here... Right here?

70
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,414
- Yes... I guess.
- Under the skin?

71
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,331
Crawling?

72
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,135
Is what crawling?

73
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,928
Near the surface or deep down?

74
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,613
How does it feel?

75
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,449
They all have

76
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,934
different natures.

77
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,858
What are you talking about?

78
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,695
Worms, my dear child.

79
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,215
What worms?

80
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,737
Don't you know, then?

81
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,768
You have worms under your skin.

82
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,978
All kinds of worms, dear Betty.

83
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:20,618
Tiny ones, big fat ones,
busy ones, and lazy ones.

84
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:25,373
And surely many other
more insidious little beasts.

85
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:30,536
I'll reveal all the facets
of their many natures for you.

86
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,731
No, don't move.

87
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,455
Watch how I track them down.

88
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,973
Filthy little things.

89
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,848
Sadistic little devils.

90
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,854
Don't be afraid.

91
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,732
Leave her alone, Doc.

92
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,017
I'm just removing a little worm.

93
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,857
Just leave her alone.

94
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,698
Come with me.
I have to tell you something.

95
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,492
Just a second, she wants me...

96
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,698
This is urgent. Come with me.

97
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,897
Afraid I might hurt her?

98
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,215
You know I...

99
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,251
- Waiter.
- Yes, ma'am.

100
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,498
Give me a drink.

101
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,889
What d'they all have against me?

102
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,889
Waiter.

103
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,091
Yes, ma'am. The same?

104
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,415
No. Have any cigarettes?

105
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,099
I'll see.

106
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,336
Mario will drive him home.

107
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,849
May I?

108
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,329
Did he scare you?

109
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,010
It's nothing.
He's a charming fellow.

110
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,170
Cheers!

111
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,935
Here's to you.

112
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:12,058
You realize he's a junkie.
He left you to have a shot.

113
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,819
Known him long?

114
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:15,975
No.

115
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:20,330
His name's Bernard.
He was a doctor in Versailles.

116
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,579
I'm thirsty.

117
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,296
You're a real hit with Alan.

118
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,537
He keeps ogling you.
He's on his 8th scotch.

119
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,979
If it makes him happy.

120
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,573
Mario's back.

121
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,939
It's pouring out.

122
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,609
Put him to bed?

123
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,969
With his wife's help.

124
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,772
Was he ranting?

125
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:49,333
He was counting rabbits
on the ceiling.

126
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,455
When he's like that
he sees animals everywhere.

127
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,298
Not to mention

128
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:59,495
the worms he keeps stabbing at
with that gold toothpick.

129
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,338
He tried it on you?

130
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,894
You write:

131
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:07,217
I, the undersigned,
Elizabeth Etamble...

132
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,455
<i>She wrote Betty.</i>

133
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,332
Ah, no. Not Betty!

134
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,894
Elizabeth!

135
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,458
I, the undersigned,
Elizabeth Etamble...

136
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,978
née Fayet,

137
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,215
28 years old, no profession,

138
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,409
residing at 6 Ave Ruysdaël, Paris,

139
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,614
do hereby state

140
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,291
that I accept without reservation

141
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,808
the following conditions...

142
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,973
I sold them.

143
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,818
Sold what, my dear?

144
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,694
I gotta get drunk. Excuse me.

145
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,174
Of course.

146
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,332
Do you live around here?

147
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:10,736
Paris?

148
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,817
I don't live anywhere!

149
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,138
Would you like a small one?

150
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:22,529
Your yank admirer
came over with NATO

151
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,458
when he was about 20.

152
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:28,696
Now that he's retired,
he's settled here.

153
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,177
He comes in nearly every night
in his old uniform.

154
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:36,976
I wrote just as they wanted,
I wrote Elizabeth, not Betty.

155
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,091
And I took the check.

156
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,859
And I walked out.

157
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:48,051
You don't give a shit!
You don't give a shit!

158
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,049
Mario.

159
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,856
- Do you have any gauze?
- I think so.

160
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,573
In the drawer.

161
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,688
I'll take her home.

162
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,810
You?

163
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,612
- Sure, why not?
- To the Trianon?

164
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,857
Couldn't she use a doctor?

165
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,534
What for?

166
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,738
Put her in my car.

167
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,968
Be careful.

168
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:21,213
Joseph! My friend's ill.
Is the room next to mine free?

169
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,773
Of course, Madame.

170
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:37,934
Did I wake you?

171
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,694
I don't know.

172
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,770
I wondered if you needed anything.

173
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,695
How do you feel?

174
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,017
Fine, fine.

175
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,975
Even my headache's gone.

176
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,214
I think I'm hungry.

177
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,895
What would you like?

178
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,292
Ham and eggs.

179
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,130
Have you eaten?

180
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,213
Yes, ages ago.

181
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,769
Is it late?

182
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,013
It's 4 o'clock.

183
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,378
Do you like your eggs well done?

184
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,135
Tea or coffee?

185
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,409
Black coffee.

186
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:21,058
Henry! I'd like some ham and eggs,
well done, and black coffee.

187
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,899
Good coffee,
not this morning's dishwater.

188
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,095
Thank you.

189
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,373
Shall I open the curtains?

190
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,976
Did you give me a shot?
I feel...

191
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,250
Yes, but don't worry.

192
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:44,179
I was a nurse for 25 years.

193
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,013
My husband was a doctor.

194
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,892
And I washed you,

195
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,933
because you threw up.

196
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:55,216
How about a nice hot bath
before breakfast?

197
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,856
Don't get up. I'll draw your bath.

198
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,728
It's not too hot?

199
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,339
It's just right.

200
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,451
Do you feel dizzy?

201
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,218
Just a little.

202
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,612
I'm ashamed I've bothered you so.

203
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,859
Not at all.

204
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,139
I've seen worse.

205
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:35,048
Don't fall asleep in the water.

206
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,257
I won't.

207
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:39,691
I've been here for 3 years.
It's a bit like home.

208
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:47,776
I sent your clothes out to clean.
The maid should bring them up.

209
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,537
Just leave it here please.

210
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,894
Wait. I've found you some slippers.

211
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,808
They're a bit big.

212
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:15,977
It's okay.

213
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,737
I wish I knew your name.

214
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,813
It's Laure.

215
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,419
Laure Levaucher.

216
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:26,620
My husband taught medecine in Lyon.

217
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,573
I lost him 4 years ago.

218
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,579
Aren't you eating?

219
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,656
- I'm not hungry.
- Yes, you are.

220
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,459
You have to eat.

221
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,816
I couldn't stand living alone.

222
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,170
I came here for 2 or 3 weeks' rest

223
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,018
and I'm still here.

224
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,569
My name's Betty.

225
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,533
Bon appetit, Betty.

226
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,577
I was pretty drunk, wasn't I?

227
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,133
Above all, sick.

228
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,251
No, I was dead drunk.

229
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:07,815
Did I behave badly?

230
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:12,128
Oh, my poor child!
Obviously you don't know The Hole.

231
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,452
Aren't you eating?

232
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,299
I can't swallow.

233
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:20,413
Maybe you'd like to be left alone.

234
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,091
Do you want to phone, write...

235
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,858
No, no.

236
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,814
Is there anything
you need picked up?

237
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:33,896
I'll leave you.

238
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,250
No, oh no.

239
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,168
Are you all right?

240
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,699
Not very.

241
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,373
Do you feel nauseous?

242
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,172
Do you want a drink?

243
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,219
For me, that's all that works.

244
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:00,176
That's better.
I didn't think I'd make it in time.

245
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,298
Do you know where we are?

246
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,776
Sure, come on.
The Trianon in Versailles.

247
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,379
How about staying
for a few days' rest?

248
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,729
I don't know.

249
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,013
I don't feel like anything.

250
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,453
Listen, Betty...

251
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,330
I call you Betty,
you call me Laure.

252
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,655
Okay.

253
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:30,339
You seemed a bit lost last night.

254
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,491
As if you had no place to sleep.

255
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,775
Would you like
to hear my life story?

256
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,416
For 28 years
I was a happy middle-class wife.

257
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:52,328
My husband and home in Lyon
were my whole world to me.

258
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:57,096
If I'd had children,
obviously I wouldn't be here.

259
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:01,134
I have no more reason to live,
you see.

260
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,177
I'm sure you understand.

261
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,488
Before I came here,
I started drinking heavily.

262
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,094
Getting away saved my life.

263
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,412
What happens to me, what I do now

264
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,252
no longer means anything.

265
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:34,498
People come to visit the park,

266
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,772
tourists come and go
through the hotel.

267
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:43,017
I'm sure they think
I'm part of the staff.

268
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:49,373
I had you put next door,
in case you needed any help.

269
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,808
And I did.

270
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:56,014
Now you can do as you like,
you can leave... or you can stay

271
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,176
another day or two...

272
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,575
Or change rooms...

273
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,099
No, no.

274
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:08,693
Well, tonight I'll be at The Hole.
I go every night.

275
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,779
Was it your first time?

276
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:13,856
Yes.

277
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,619
Didn't you notice anything?

278
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:18,254
In my condition... you know...

279
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:22,018
Mario says his clients
are all twisted.

280
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,659
Shall I tell you
about Mario and The Hole?

281
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:26,532
Sure.

282
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,090
Want another?

283
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,649
Will it hurt me?

284
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,653
It shouldn't.

285
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:32,932
Fine.

286
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,855
Mario likes to play the tough guy.

287
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:40,533
Most clients think he was in prison.

288
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,773
It excites the ladies.

289
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,658
In fact, he used to be a bartender.

290
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:50,134
And then he drove a cab in Toulon.

291
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:54,090
But he claims he was a sailor.

292
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:59,774
Anyway, one of his fares
was a rich South American lady.

293
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:03,775
Her husband had just
died of a stroke,

294
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:07,054
coming out of a Monte Carlo casino.

295
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:11,692
He owned a cocoa plantation
in Colombia.

296
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,773
Mario says she was...
absolutely twisted.

297
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,497
In any case he became

298
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:22,496
her chauffeur, factotum,
and certainly everything else.

299
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,730
Am I boring you?

300
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,011
On the contrary...

301
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:35,655
I'm not sure about the rest.
Now it's a mix of fact and fiction.

302
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:41,851
The woman was named Maria Orutti,

303
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:45,619
from one of
the country's oldest families.

304
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:50,609
After the husband died,
they begged her to return.

305
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:55,814
They harrassed her with telegrams,
threatening to cut off the money.

306
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:59,695
It made her crazy.
She'd say: "They hate me."

307
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:04,416
<i>"It's to keel me,
to put me in an asylum</i>

308
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,451
<i>"that they want me home."</i>

309
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:11,099
<i>"Come with me. You are strong.
You will protect me."</i>

310
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,417
<i>So they sailed back together.</i>

311
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:18,180
<i>But Mario never had a chance.</i>

312
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:23,216
<i>The family was waiting
with the police to take her away...</i>

313
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,738
And how go the studies?

314
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,214
All right.

315
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:33,617
<i>So Mario was stranded
in a strange port, flat broke.</i>

316
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:38,297
<i>He claims he had dozens of jobs,
not all so legal, it seems.</i>

317
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,377
Do you know Lyon, Elizabeth?

318
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,533
No, not at all.

319
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,249
<i>But I think</i>

320
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,610
<i>the family paid him to disappear.</i>

321
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:50,458
<i>He roamed around
Venezuela and Panama.</i>

322
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:55,415
<i>When he got back, he bought The Hole.
God knows how he managed,</i>

323
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:59,053
<i>but he built up
a solid little clientele.</i>

324
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:01,490
<i>People you never thought existed.</i>

325
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,338
<i>All twisted, like he says.</i>

326
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,538
People like me.

327
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:22,253
Can I have some luggage picked up?

328
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:26,294
Of course, Madame. Just leave us
instructions with the address.

329
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,218
Charles, see to Madame.

330
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:34,528
There'll be a few bags
and maybe a trunk.

331
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,930
6 Ave Ruysdaël.

332
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,539
Etamble? Like the General?

333
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,173
I'm his daughter-in-law.

334
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:44,453
Do you know how many pieces
there will be?

335
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,490
No.

336
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,898
Will one car be enough?

337
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,658
Yes, of course.

338
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:53,648
If you wrote a note,
that might help avoid problems.

339
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:00,095
Will this evening be a good time?

340
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,057
Will someone be there?

341
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:09,410
<i>Please give my things
to the bearer - Thanks.</i>

342
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,973
There's always someone.

343
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,529
Whenever there's a storm,
I lose 2 or 3.

344
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,253
Enough for a few days, eh?

345
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,337
How d'you know?

346
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,535
Well, Betty...

347
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,413
How's the lasagna?

348
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,769
It's excellent.

349
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,971
Beats the shitty cassoulet?

350
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,772
The cassoulet's good.

351
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,733
Not so bad here, huh?

352
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:45,257
I feel like an old customer already.

353
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,854
Nice to say that.

354
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,212
Looks like our gang
isn't coming out tonight.

355
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,057
They're afraid to get wet.

356
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,898
It's a bit early.

357
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,733
So, how's the stomach?

358
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,498
For the moment, okay.

359
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:09,774
See the guy over there,
the Kojak lookalike?

360
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,698
He's an English lord.

361
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:12,935
His name's John.

362
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:17,009
He'll sit there for hours
without a word.

363
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:21,852
He knows when it's time to go,
down to the second.

364
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:25,736
He'll stand up straight as a rod.

365
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,658
And the girl will follow him.

366
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,693
They change every week.

367
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,175
And you'll never guess...

368
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:36,220
You'll never guess what I did today.

369
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,570
No, Mother, what did you do?

370
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,133
Did you see a movie?

371
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,972
How did you guess?

372
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,138
I just said it like that.

373
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,778
What did you see?

374
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:51,333
Something about an abortionist.
I didn't like it in the least.

375
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:56,259
Aren't you watching, Elizabeth?

376
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,576
No, thank you, Mother.

377
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:05,054
Is the television too loud, Guy?

378
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:09,048
Not at all, Mother.
I can always work in my study.

379
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:12,013
Oh my dear,
I like having you around me.

380
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,773
Are Frederic and Odile
coming down today?

381
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:24,572
They won't be long. I believe
they're even going out tonight.

382
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,014
Where are they going?

383
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,699
You can ask them.

384
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:35,338
You ate nicely.
And now we go to bed.

385
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,252
Time to go beddy-bye.

386
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,330
And you too.

387
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:53,497
After they're asleep an hour,
I'll take my night off, as you said.

388
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,539
Charlotte wants to stay
with us 5 minutes.

389
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:18,174
I advise you not to give in,
Elizabeth.

390
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:22,335
My husband always said
to earn a child's respect, never

391
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,450
give in to them.

392
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,652
Well, well, well.
What's all this?

393
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,453
It's out of the question.

394
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,928
Off to bed like a good girl.

395
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:38,256
Daddy has work to do. Off you go!

396
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:41,855
Say goodnight to Grandmother.

397
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:44,415
Good night, my dear. Sweet dreams.

398
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,569
Off you go!

399
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:53,731
We can't stay.
We have a reception at the ministry.

400
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,293
You don't say!

401
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,014
How lucky!
You'll be terribly amused.

402
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,290
It's unspeakably dreary.

403
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,695
But we can't avoid it.

404
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,854
- But have a quick porto first.
- I'll get it.

405
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:10,496
Just a drop.
We can't totter into the Ministry.

406
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,019
What's the bash for?

407
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:16,008
Some bash! The Minister
of Defense of Burkina Faso.

408
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,494
<i>Oh, Negroes.</i>

409
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,533
Porto, or something else?

410
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,978
Thanks, my dear. Will you serve?

411
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,492
Not having any, Elizabeth?

412
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,418
No, I'm not.

413
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,617
Happy with the nurse?

414
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:44,730
Yes.

415
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:48,258
She's so perfect,
we almost feel like intruders.

416
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:53,058
That's the problem:
Either they're possessive or inept.

417
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,010
Frédéric, remember...

418
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:57,018
...Antoine's German nurse?
- Don't mention her.

419
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:00,371
A pain in the ass,
if you'll excuse me.

420
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,855
I had to apply for visiting rights.

421
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,130
You're exaggerating.

422
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,099
Not at all.

423
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:10,373
Remember, Guy?
Before you were with us, Betty.

424
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:14,573
What was her name, Frédéric?

425
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,089
Not Big Bertha?

426
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,694
You're always joking!

427
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,972
Frédéric! What was her name?

428
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,252
<i>I think it was Bertha.</i>

429
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,893
Why, no!

430
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:28,410
Mother, remember the German nurse?

431
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,698
What was her name?

432
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,329
Mom?

433
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,419
Is she asleep?

434
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,534
My God!

435
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,129
What is it?

436
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,858
I don't know. She looks dead.

437
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:53,731
She watched him laid out on the bed

438
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:56,057
for more than an hour.

439
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:59,252
Finally she realized he was asleep,

440
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,655
an empty glass in his hand.

441
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,690
Really twisted.

442
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,932
What are you thinking about?

443
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,618
My mother-in-law.

444
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,971
Oh, but I know her.

445
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:16,217
We lived on the same street in Lyon.

446
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,888
- Strange, I had a feeling.
- Oh, really?

447
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,533
She had a heart attack, you know?

448
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,253
My god! When was that?

449
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,610
It was 7 or 8 months ago.

450
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,579
And how is she now?

451
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:29,852
Oh, she's fully recovered now.

452
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:33,889
She's been back in Paris 3...
no, 4 days.

453
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,852
She's staying with us,

454
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,972
I mean my husband, Guy,
the younger son.

455
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:44,298
The one who refused an army career.
The General was livid.

456
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:49,096
The older one, he's working
in the Defense Ministry. Frédéric.

457
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,856
He lives above our place.
I mean Guy's.

458
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:56,416
Yes, he married the Fleury girl.
Odile, no?

459
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,656
I knew her sister quite well.

460
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:01,772
A Lyon family,
vaguely related to mine.

461
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,655
And your mother-in-law
is a Gomieux.

462
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:11,576
...except... Hector,
an oculist in Broussais.

463
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:15,059
This is like being in a Lyon salon.

464
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:18,459
That's what we call
dead weight of Society.

465
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:22,696
I know that the Etambles have
a country estate in Chassagne wood,

466
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:26,973
near Chalamont,
where my brother shoots duck.

467
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,853
I went there
each of our 6 married years.

468
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:33,370
The family spent August there.

469
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,174
The General, his wife,
the 2 brothers,

470
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,012
their wives, the children.

471
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,658
A nightmare, those summers.

472
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,415
Frédéric and Guy
playing tennis all day.

473
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:50,972
I suppose you'd like
to have lasagna.

474
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:52,535
What else
do you have?

475
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:53,968
Lasagna.

476
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,372
We made a mistake.

477
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,291
That's what I figured.

478
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:01,975
Okay. We'll have lasagna.

479
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,249
There you are!

480
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:09,976
I have two children. Two girls.

481
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:13,337
Charlotte is 4
and Anne-Marie 19 months.

482
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:16,179
Starting to talk like a real person.

483
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,618
Good evening Laure...

484
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:22,298
I hope you excuse my decamping

485
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:25,936
last night.
I believe Laure explained...

486
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:33,294
You didn't surprise your aunt?

487
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:38,255
Oh Daddy. Auntie was arranging
the attic. Remember the attic?

488
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:43,215
<i>So we climbed up silently.
And then Laurence goes mooooo...</i>

489
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,091
Really, Laurence.

490
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,689
Like a cow had snuck into the attic.

491
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:51,337
Auntie was so scared
she dropped a pile of books.

492
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,898
It's not their fault.

493
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,010
Pardon?

494
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,055
Would you mind if we left?

495
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,498
Don't you feel well?

496
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,497
I just want to go back.

497
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:12,016
Excuse me, Madame Etamble.

498
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:15,579
I've put your luggage in your room.

499
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:18,214
The driver left this for you.

500
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:26,979
It's Elda's writing. The nurse.

501
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:29,137
She packed my bags.

502
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,690
Well, I'll leave you, as you...

503
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:36,850
You're going back?

504
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,175
No, no, but

505
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:42,214
I imagine you want
to unpack your bags in peace.

506
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:44,012
Do you mind staying?

507
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:46,939
Not at all! I don't want to impose.

508
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:50,457
I absolutely adore packing
and unpacking.

509
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:55,216
I used to spend all day packing
for trips with my husband.

510
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,498
My mink.

511
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,855
<i>It's an investment.</i>

512
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:05,373
And as you'll need it one day,

513
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:09,972
best buy it now since it will
cost more in 2 or 3 years.

514
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,775
Guy said it was an investment.

515
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,018
I was afraid he'd keep it.

516
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,736
I'll fix you a drink.

517
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:25,977
I'm embarrassed. You always buy.

518
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:28,011
I promise I'll let you

519
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:30,575
buy the next bottle. The next two!

520
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,339
My daughters.

521
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:40,576
This one looks like you.
She has your eyes.

522
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:47,455
Cheers! To you, and for all
you've done for me.

523
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,690
But they're not my children now.

524
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:01,418
In fact, I don't think
they ever were.

525
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:03,975
Except when I was expecting.

526
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:06,251
Do you believe in motherly love?

527
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:11,973
Ah, I forgot. You don't have kids.
You couldn't know.

528
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:17,016
Maternal love, like in books or
songs, like we're taught at school.

529
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:19,615
I believed in it when I got married.

530
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,891
One day I'd have children.

531
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:27,013
A nice idea, part of a whole:
A home, a family.

532
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:31,015
When I learned I was pregnant
I was confused.

533
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:33,529
I didn't expect it so soon.

534
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:39,251
<i>Married just 2 years, and now
everyone only spoke of the child.</i>

535
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,974
<i>Even before its birth
I was the mother.</i>

536
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,978
Maybe I was jealous.

537
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,378
But I don't really think so.

538
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:50,891
For me, marriage was 2
and we were already 3!

539
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:53,098
Yeah! They took care of me.

540
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:57,054
My health failed.
And that's when they took over.

541
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:00,491
They would have kept me in bed.
My mother-in-law

542
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,769
came up from Lyon.

543
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:06,417
Very well, my child. Above all,
no stress. Think of the baby,

544
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,736
and follow Doctor's orders.

545
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:20,859
At night Guy brought flowers
and stayed 30, 45 minutes.

546
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,618
But he had nothing to say.

547
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,168
They were so impatient

548
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:36,134
they brought me to the clinic
48 hours early.

549
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:40,458
I was afraid that I'd pay
for all the harm I'd done.

550
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:44,778
And yet, I rebelled.
Very confusing.

551
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,019
Yes, I understand.

552
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:51,656
You do? No, I don't
think that's possible.

553
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,691
Why, yes. I understand.

554
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:57,496
Anyway. The child was born.
It was a girl.

555
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,577
Everyone pretended to be happy.

556
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:03,290
My husband seemed so loving.
I was thrilled.

557
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:08,450
Then I saw the love wasn't for me
but for his baby's mother.

558
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:12,369
<i>It was his child. Any woman
could have played my part.</i>

559
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:16,738
And then they hired a nurse. Swiss.

560
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,498
You rest, my love.

561
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,890
Elda will take care of the child.

562
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,410
What's maternal instinct?

563
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,815
I never even learned
to hold the baby right.

564
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:38,217
Elda would immediately
come to its rescue.

565
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:41,693
Several times a day
I'd go to the nursery.

566
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,460
Elda would put a finger to her lips.

567
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:47,572
Or signal not to disturb
her feeding...

568
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:51,210
or diaper her,
and I was just allowed to watch.

569
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:54,612
Everything was clean,
everything in order.

570
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:59,216
That was 4 years ago.
Charlotte grew up,

571
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:03,618
she talked, she walked.
And she's still not my daughter.

572
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:06,171
I don't know what they'll say:

573
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:09,213
That I'm dead,

574
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,130
or went off on a long trip.

575
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,213
You won't see her again?

576
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:17,813
They're against it. I promised.

577
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,012
It's not important.

578
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,694
Where's my drink?

579
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:30,336
I'm gonna wind up being a drag.

580
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:34,815
Thanks.

581
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,853
Want to see my father?

582
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,613
He died in Morocco.

583
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,811
I was only eight.

584
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,295
He was in Morocco a few months.

585
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:53,335
I never knew
what he was doing there.

586
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,496
Nor did my mother.

587
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,538
I remember him well.

588
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:01,579
Never serious.
Always joking about things.

589
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:05,097
Mom told him:
Comb your hair for the photo.

590
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,018
"I am the way I am."

591
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:10,052
Do you see your mother?

592
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,733
No, not often.

593
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:17,859
My father had a... not really a...
a little factory... a store...

594
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:20,130
where he made fertilizers.

595
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:25,215
A chemist ran the show after he died.
Mom sold it 3 years ago,

596
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:27,490
and kept the apartment upstairs.

597
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:29,858
She never remarried?

598
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,655
No.

599
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:36,253
When I was 10,
she sent me to her sister.

600
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:39,770
Said the country was good
for my bad health.

601
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,772
Do you know the Vendée?

602
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,209
No.

603
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,099
Just the beach resort.

604
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:48,736
Ah. Well, we were inland,
near Deux-Sèvres.

605
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:53,172
Unca and Auntie had
an inn in a village there.

606
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,778
I liked it a lot there.

607
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:01,256
The rooms were damp
and had feather beds,

608
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,973
to snuggle in.

609
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:09,812
I forgot that I had
a photo of Thérèse.

610
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,579
Who is Thérèse?

611
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:19,573
The chambermaid at the inn.
Welfare sent her. She was fifteen.

612
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:23,853
She was always in black.
It was her only dress.

613
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:26,570
Her tiny breasts showed through.

614
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:28,299
It made me jealous.

615
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,818
Thérèse!

616
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,093
Thérèse!

617
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:36,649
Where is she now, the little sneak?

618
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:37,815
Thérèse.

619
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:39,419
Yes Madame.

620
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:40,575
The rooms made?

621
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,215
Yes Madame.

622
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:43,899
Let's prepare the beans.

623
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:47,058
<i>I wanted to be her friend,
but she was too old.</i>

624
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:50,009
So I made do, hanging around her.

625
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:53,053
Schwartz used to tease me
about her.

626
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:54,893
Did I tell you about him?

627
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,733
No, I don't think so.

628
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:00,455
Sure I did.
He was the medical student.

629
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:04,255
He washed dishes
to pay for his studies.

630
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:07,020
He lived in a maid's room
near the Place des Ternes.

631
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:10,018
I met him only because
he lived near us.

632
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:14,977
Charlotte was almost
a year old by then.

633
00:42:15,681 --> 00:42:19,959
From his bed I could see
hundreds of chimneys.

634
00:42:20,521 --> 00:42:24,070
Thérèse was your biggest
childhood influence.

635
00:42:24,881 --> 00:42:26,792
Tell me about Thérèse.

636
00:42:28,281 --> 00:42:30,112
What went on with Thérèse?

637
00:42:35,161 --> 00:42:38,676
It was a Saturday.
Auntie took the car

638
00:42:38,881 --> 00:42:40,872
to the St. Mathurin market.

639
00:42:41,641 --> 00:42:42,994
It was during vacation

640
00:42:43,201 --> 00:42:45,317
or maybe I skipped school.

641
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:46,795
I don't remember.

642
00:43:39,121 --> 00:43:42,318
He was mounting her.
There's no other word.

643
00:43:42,921 --> 00:43:45,310
It smelled like a stable.

644
00:43:45,881 --> 00:43:47,473
I couldn't move.

645
00:43:48,241 --> 00:43:50,835
It was like I was hypnotized.

646
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:54,119
Their thighs looked like
they were alive.

647
00:44:11,721 --> 00:44:14,872
Tell your aunt,
and I'll give it to you too.

648
00:44:23,441 --> 00:44:25,557
<i>I wanted to stay to the end,</i>

649
00:44:26,281 --> 00:44:28,317
<i>see Thérèse's face afterwards,</i>

650
00:44:28,841 --> 00:44:30,320
<i>hear her voice.</i>

651
00:44:31,521 --> 00:44:35,514
<i>Schwartz told me a lot
about my attachment to Thérèse.</i>

652
00:44:36,521 --> 00:44:39,194
It bothered me
that she was still a girl,

653
00:44:39,401 --> 00:44:41,392
like me,
and almost an adult.

654
00:44:41,601 --> 00:44:44,877
She'd ask to play
with one of my dolls.

655
00:44:45,921 --> 00:44:47,354
It's Lolita!

656
00:44:48,041 --> 00:44:51,397
You want the clinical
medical truth?

657
00:44:51,761 --> 00:44:52,955
You envied her!

658
00:44:54,321 --> 00:44:55,515
Really?

659
00:44:55,801 --> 00:44:56,995
You envied her!

660
00:44:57,601 --> 00:44:58,795
To be in her place!

661
00:45:00,881 --> 00:45:05,909
It's true that from that moment
I followed her everywhere.

662
00:45:06,361 --> 00:45:08,955
I knew she wasn't happy
with my uncle.

663
00:45:09,161 --> 00:45:12,153
He was jealous, he spied on her.

664
00:45:15,401 --> 00:45:18,632
I caught her twice.
Once, in a field, during winter.

665
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:21,753
With a farm boy
in red boots.

666
00:45:21,961 --> 00:45:23,394
<i>Then, in the hallway...</i>

667
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:26,999
Hurry. If I stay too long,
he'll come up.

668
00:45:34,761 --> 00:45:39,118
Hey hey hey. Stickel
wrote about a similar case.

669
00:45:39,321 --> 00:45:41,516
<i>Bewusstein un... der Sexualität</i>

670
00:45:41,721 --> 00:45:44,952
You don't see
that she can and does like it.

671
00:45:45,161 --> 00:45:49,677
A woman should suffer for a man.
That's what marked you.

672
00:45:51,441 --> 00:45:52,920
He was right.

673
00:45:54,321 --> 00:45:57,711
I thought women had to suffer,
to be victims.

674
00:45:58,481 --> 00:45:59,994
I was afraid,

675
00:46:00,961 --> 00:46:02,553
terribly afraid,

676
00:46:03,121 --> 00:46:04,634
but I was tempted.

677
00:46:05,601 --> 00:46:09,310
My stomach hurt.
I was so tempted... and so afraid.

678
00:46:11,881 --> 00:46:13,234
I'm boring you, huh?

679
00:46:13,921 --> 00:46:17,550
No no no. Not at all, not at all.
On the contrary.

680
00:46:18,721 --> 00:46:20,359
I'll get you a drink.

681
00:46:21,001 --> 00:46:23,595
That's all.
My uncle never touched me.

682
00:46:23,801 --> 00:46:26,440
Anyway, I stayed 'til I was 14.

683
00:46:27,841 --> 00:46:31,959
<i>I wondered what I'd do
if he got me in the cellar.</i>

684
00:46:33,081 --> 00:46:35,993
I'd be afraid,
but I don't think I'd scream,

685
00:46:36,641 --> 00:46:38,836
I don't think I'd struggle.

686
00:46:40,241 --> 00:46:41,515
But he didn't do it.

687
00:46:45,001 --> 00:46:46,639
No, he didn't.

688
00:46:50,161 --> 00:46:52,800
You know, I wanted to ask Thérèse

689
00:46:53,001 --> 00:46:55,231
when I saw her in the cellar.

690
00:46:56,401 --> 00:46:58,835
I wanted to say:
Show me your wound.

691
00:47:00,281 --> 00:47:02,556
I wanted to have a wound too.

692
00:47:06,161 --> 00:47:08,595
I've always been chasing that wound.

693
00:47:09,721 --> 00:47:12,030
I must be looking for pity.

694
00:47:14,361 --> 00:47:15,999
I'm not a victim.

695
00:47:17,841 --> 00:47:19,399
I'm not to be pitied.

696
00:47:19,681 --> 00:47:21,797
No one ever hurt me.

697
00:47:23,681 --> 00:47:25,876
I'm the one who did the hurting.

698
00:47:27,481 --> 00:47:28,994
I'm a fool.

699
00:47:30,561 --> 00:47:31,789
Say it!

700
00:47:32,841 --> 00:47:34,399
I blew it all.

701
00:47:34,721 --> 00:47:38,077
I've soiled everything,
myself included.

702
00:47:40,161 --> 00:47:41,992
Since I was 15.

703
00:47:42,721 --> 00:47:45,713
I've been a whore
just to imitate Thérèse.

704
00:47:49,161 --> 00:47:50,958
I sold my children.

705
00:47:51,761 --> 00:47:53,513
My husband threw me out.

706
00:47:53,961 --> 00:47:55,917
It's an official document.

707
00:47:56,881 --> 00:47:59,395
I, Elizabeth Etamble, née Fayet,

708
00:48:00,361 --> 00:48:04,991
declare I am a whore, had lovers
before and during my marriage,

709
00:48:05,201 --> 00:48:07,112
solicited them in bars,

710
00:48:09,081 --> 00:48:12,437
that I made love next
to my children's room.

711
00:48:18,641 --> 00:48:19,790
Here...

712
00:48:20,401 --> 00:48:22,676
when I say I sold them,
I'm not lying.

713
00:48:23,801 --> 00:48:25,200
200,000 francs!

714
00:48:25,521 --> 00:48:26,920
As a down payment...

715
00:48:27,841 --> 00:48:29,752
Otherwise it'd be too cheap.

716
00:48:31,841 --> 00:48:34,401
"I don't want you on the street",
he said.

717
00:48:37,321 --> 00:48:39,152
I don't want you on the street.

718
00:48:40,001 --> 00:48:42,231
As soon as you have an address,
send it to me,

719
00:48:42,481 --> 00:48:45,234
so my lawyer can get
in contact with you.

720
00:48:45,721 --> 00:48:47,871
You won't go without.

721
00:48:48,401 --> 00:48:50,676
There it is... my wound,

722
00:48:51,281 --> 00:48:55,991
all my wounds, all the men I've
chased after, just to hurt myself.

723
00:49:00,321 --> 00:49:02,596
For years I've hidden my drinking,

724
00:49:02,801 --> 00:49:06,476
'cause I can't live without it,
can't be like them.

725
00:49:07,801 --> 00:49:09,712
Anyway, I don't want to be.

726
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:13,034
But I stopped when I was pregnant.

727
00:49:13,321 --> 00:49:18,349
I gave him kids as he asked,
but I wanted them to be healthy.

728
00:49:19,561 --> 00:49:21,233
Still, I took a bottle
to the clinic,

729
00:49:21,841 --> 00:49:25,516
a little flask,
and right after the delivery...

730
00:49:28,121 --> 00:49:31,113
A drunk and whore...
that's what I am.

731
00:49:31,721 --> 00:49:33,393
Calm down.

732
00:49:33,961 --> 00:49:37,033
- Don't be a fool!
- You're just like them!

733
00:49:42,681 --> 00:49:43,716
Come on.

734
00:49:44,961 --> 00:49:46,758
Go to bed. Get undressed.

735
00:50:09,161 --> 00:50:10,958
You're like ice.

736
00:50:11,881 --> 00:50:13,917
I'll prepare a hot-water bottle.

737
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:38,240
<i>Madame Etamble?
Hello? Madame Etamble!</i>

738
00:50:40,121 --> 00:50:41,031
Who is it?

739
00:50:41,241 --> 00:50:43,994
<i>The switchboard.
I have a call from Paris.</i>

740
00:50:45,041 --> 00:50:46,315
<i>I'll connect you.</i>

741
00:50:46,521 --> 00:50:48,671
<i>Hello! Betty? It's Florent!</i>

742
00:50:49,641 --> 00:50:51,074
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

743
00:50:51,281 --> 00:50:53,511
<i>I can hardly hear you. You okay?</i>

744
00:50:53,721 --> 00:50:54,597
Yes.

745
00:50:55,681 --> 00:50:57,353
<i>You're sure you're all right?</i>

746
00:50:59,241 --> 00:50:59,832
Yes.

747
00:51:00,721 --> 00:51:04,270
Not in pain? I hardly hear you.
You still in bed?

748
00:51:04,881 --> 00:51:05,393
Yes.

749
00:51:06,841 --> 00:51:09,833
Can I talk to you? Are you alone?

750
00:51:12,201 --> 00:51:12,997
Yes.

751
00:51:13,401 --> 00:51:16,598
Guy asked me to contact you.

752
00:51:16,801 --> 00:51:18,837
Naturally, the sooner the better.

753
00:51:19,121 --> 00:51:23,433
I could come out to Versailles
and we could have dinner.

754
00:51:23,841 --> 00:51:25,638
No, not today.

755
00:51:28,201 --> 00:51:31,716
Tomorrow morning?
The afternoon I'm in court.

756
00:51:32,201 --> 00:51:33,190
No. Not tomorrow.

757
00:51:33,401 --> 00:51:35,232
<i>When, then? As you like...</i>

758
00:51:35,441 --> 00:51:38,035
I don't know. I'll call you.

759
00:51:38,241 --> 00:51:40,391
<i>You okay? If you need any help...</i>

760
00:51:40,601 --> 00:51:44,196
I'm okay. I don't need any help.
Goodbye Florent.

761
00:51:56,681 --> 00:51:59,400
You slept through Act 2
on my shoulder.

762
00:51:59,601 --> 00:52:01,000
On purpose.

763
00:52:02,921 --> 00:52:05,276
- Let's boogie! Okay?
- I love it.

764
00:52:09,241 --> 00:52:12,438
Taking my wife? I'll take yours.
Know where it is?

765
00:52:12,641 --> 00:52:14,518
Yeah, yeah. No problem.

766
00:52:58,921 --> 00:53:01,071
Betty, not in your nose!

767
00:53:01,121 --> 00:53:02,395
It's dirty.

768
00:53:09,801 --> 00:53:14,477
Robert! Change that disgusting
shirt. Pigs for a family!

769
00:53:14,881 --> 00:53:18,271
What do you want?
We are what we are.

770
00:53:20,481 --> 00:53:22,437
That's just like you. Dirty girl!

771
00:53:23,601 --> 00:53:27,560
You write 50 times:
I'm a dirty little girl.

772
00:53:29,481 --> 00:53:31,392
It's true I'm dirty,

773
00:53:32,041 --> 00:53:34,396
but I wanted to be clean, too.

774
00:53:37,321 --> 00:53:40,358
Oh! I'm sorry.
I'm really so sorry!

775
00:53:41,081 --> 00:53:43,720
Say Guy,
isn't that your brand new suit?

776
00:53:43,921 --> 00:53:47,072
Well uh, that is...
it was my new suit...

777
00:53:47,441 --> 00:53:48,874
Look at me!

778
00:53:50,201 --> 00:53:51,919
Do you have any spot remover?

779
00:53:52,121 --> 00:53:53,839
- I'll go see.
- Thanks.

780
00:53:54,881 --> 00:53:56,200
Do you work
for a dry cleaner's?

781
00:53:56,401 --> 00:53:59,711
No, I'm a secretary.
But my father was a chemist.

782
00:54:00,561 --> 00:54:03,029
So you know about chemicals!

783
00:54:03,521 --> 00:54:06,319
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right. I know.

784
00:54:06,521 --> 00:54:10,753
To apologize correctly,
you must have a coffee with us.

785
00:54:10,961 --> 00:54:13,794
I really, I can't. I'm late.

786
00:54:15,121 --> 00:54:15,951
No, no.

787
00:54:16,161 --> 00:54:17,355
Yes... yes.

788
00:54:17,561 --> 00:54:21,190
No. If you're well brought up,
you can't refuse.

789
00:54:21,401 --> 00:54:23,517
Well, just to show I am.

790
00:54:23,721 --> 00:54:24,631
That's better.

791
00:54:28,041 --> 00:54:28,632
Don't worry.

792
00:54:28,841 --> 00:54:30,559
That suit's 2 years old.

793
00:54:30,841 --> 00:54:32,752
That's not true, 3 years old.

794
00:54:33,161 --> 00:54:34,150
Here you are.

795
00:54:34,601 --> 00:54:35,511
Thank you.

796
00:54:35,841 --> 00:54:37,911
And another coffee, please.

797
00:54:40,361 --> 00:54:44,149
Well, what should I do with this?

798
00:54:44,561 --> 00:54:46,040
Shall I remove your stain?

799
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:47,151
Please!

800
00:54:56,801 --> 00:54:58,598
- You're not serious.
- I am!

801
00:54:58,801 --> 00:54:59,870
You're crazy!

802
00:55:00,841 --> 00:55:02,035
Yes!

803
00:55:02,481 --> 00:55:04,119
Yes, I'm crazy!

804
00:55:10,921 --> 00:55:11,433
So...

805
00:55:13,721 --> 00:55:14,710
thought it over?

806
00:55:17,841 --> 00:55:18,990
I'm listening.

807
00:55:21,001 --> 00:55:22,320
Guy, you know...

808
00:55:22,761 --> 00:55:23,989
You don't love me enough?

809
00:55:24,561 --> 00:55:26,597
No, you know that's not true.

810
00:55:27,721 --> 00:55:28,631
So?

811
00:55:29,081 --> 00:55:30,992
I'd rather not get married.

812
00:55:31,401 --> 00:55:32,436
It's better.

813
00:55:32,921 --> 00:55:35,276
Why, if you don't mind telling me?

814
00:55:37,721 --> 00:55:40,997
Because of everything.
Me. My life.

815
00:55:44,601 --> 00:55:46,398
Betty, I wasn't born yesterday.

816
00:55:47,121 --> 00:55:50,431
It's none of my business,
what you've done in the past.

817
00:55:55,481 --> 00:55:57,199
It hasn't been very pretty.

818
00:55:57,841 --> 00:55:58,910
I'm not interested.

819
00:55:59,401 --> 00:56:00,834
You don't understand.

820
00:56:01,881 --> 00:56:03,758
That life... I enjoyed it!

821
00:56:05,841 --> 00:56:07,354
It's gone.

822
00:56:09,481 --> 00:56:11,358
It's gone.

823
00:56:13,241 --> 00:56:14,151
Do you love me?

824
00:56:15,921 --> 00:56:16,910
Yes.

825
00:56:17,281 --> 00:56:19,112
So, life begins here.

826
00:56:19,721 --> 00:56:22,679
It's like we're starting
from scratch,

827
00:56:23,761 --> 00:56:25,274
you and me both.

828
00:56:26,721 --> 00:56:29,440
Saturday we go to Lyon
to meet my mother.

829
00:56:31,321 --> 00:56:34,552
- But Guy, I can't keep house!
- Don't be silly.

830
00:56:34,761 --> 00:56:36,319
We have people for that.

831
00:56:36,761 --> 00:56:38,160
You are my wife.

832
00:56:38,681 --> 00:56:40,876
<i>He is nice, you know.</i>

833
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:43,597
And he's a good fuck.

834
00:56:44,041 --> 00:56:46,953
That's why sometimes
I think I'm disgusting.

835
00:56:48,121 --> 00:56:50,077
He doesn't take care of me.

836
00:56:50,401 --> 00:56:54,280
He tries, but he only takes care
of what I represent.

837
00:56:54,761 --> 00:56:57,673
Like, if I'm sick,
I'm sent to the doctor.

838
00:56:58,041 --> 00:57:02,000
<i>The family doctor.
And he's something else!</i>

839
00:57:02,441 --> 00:57:05,001
He doesn't want his wife
to be sick.

840
00:57:05,361 --> 00:57:08,558
<i>Oh no. Not me.
The mother of his child.</i>

841
00:57:09,961 --> 00:57:12,316
It's not his fault.
It's his upbringing.

842
00:57:12,601 --> 00:57:14,592
You can't stop yourself, huh?

843
00:57:14,961 --> 00:57:16,917
You're still sublimating.

844
00:57:17,121 --> 00:57:19,635
Hey! You trying to make me fat?

845
00:57:19,841 --> 00:57:22,150
There you are. Typical, that.

846
00:57:22,361 --> 00:57:27,037
<i>You transpose the mental
to the physical. And you accuse me!</i>

847
00:57:27,241 --> 00:57:29,755
That's... that's typical. Careful!

848
00:57:29,961 --> 00:57:33,954
Dr Freud. And I thought you
were studying dermatology.

849
00:57:34,161 --> 00:57:35,514
There's no contradiction.

850
00:57:36,121 --> 00:57:37,839
Humans are a whole:

851
00:57:38,041 --> 00:57:41,716
Exterior and interior,
material and spiritual.

852
00:57:42,241 --> 00:57:43,674
You know your problem?

853
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:46,440
No. Tell me.

854
00:57:47,481 --> 00:57:51,440
In your tiny little head
you really want to be a heroine.

855
00:57:51,881 --> 00:57:55,396
You have an idea of what
you want to be... should be,

856
00:57:55,601 --> 00:57:58,354
so you fall even deeper.
It's classic!

857
00:57:59,321 --> 00:58:00,993
Me? Fall?

858
00:58:01,921 --> 00:58:05,596
Lying is natural to you.
And not just to others.

859
00:58:05,801 --> 00:58:08,395
You lie to yourself,
afraid of who you are.

860
00:58:08,601 --> 00:58:13,117
<i>Soon as you feel uneasy, pow,
you start telling yourself stories.</i>

861
00:58:14,681 --> 00:58:16,751
Shut up! What am I?

862
00:58:16,961 --> 00:58:19,953
- A guinea pig?
- Okay. Keep it up,

863
00:58:20,161 --> 00:58:22,595
and you'll end up in the morgue...

864
00:58:24,281 --> 00:58:25,236
or the nut house.

865
00:58:30,841 --> 00:58:31,910
Go on. Eat!

866
00:58:33,641 --> 00:58:35,677
I wondered if you were asleep.

867
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:41,036
Are you all right? Hungry?

868
00:58:43,241 --> 00:58:44,640
Should I order breakfast?

869
00:58:44,841 --> 00:58:46,194
No, thank you.

870
00:58:50,041 --> 00:58:50,757
Not even

871
00:58:50,961 --> 00:58:52,030
a cup of coffee?

872
00:58:55,321 --> 00:58:58,472
Does your pulse rate
sometimes drop sharply?

873
00:59:03,761 --> 00:59:05,240
Do you prefer it dark?

874
00:59:06,441 --> 00:59:07,840
I don't care.

875
00:59:14,241 --> 00:59:16,709
It's depressing, this darkness.

876
00:59:18,321 --> 00:59:21,438
At least you slept.
I didn't hear a peep.

877
00:59:22,601 --> 00:59:24,319
Do you have any pain?

878
00:59:25,281 --> 00:59:26,555
Migraine?

879
00:59:28,001 --> 00:59:32,597
Would you mind if I phoned
a doctor? I know a good one nearby.

880
00:59:33,601 --> 00:59:34,636
Bernard?

881
00:59:35,561 --> 00:59:40,191
No no no. And I promise he won't
ask any indiscreet questions.

882
00:59:40,601 --> 00:59:42,080
I don't care.

883
00:59:42,681 --> 00:59:45,195
Would you like your face washed?

884
00:59:45,721 --> 00:59:47,393
No... no.

885
01:00:01,441 --> 01:00:04,831
Blanche? Laure Levaucher.
Is the doctor in?

886
01:00:06,361 --> 01:00:09,637
Hello, Doctor?
Sorry to bother you.

887
01:00:10,041 --> 01:00:14,239
No, no. I'm calling for a friend
who's staying with me.

888
01:00:14,441 --> 01:00:16,716
<i>I'd like you to come see her.</i>

889
01:00:18,481 --> 01:00:20,676
<i>Well, it's hard to explain...</i>

890
01:00:21,681 --> 01:00:24,036
<i>Last night I gave her
some phenobarbital.</i>

891
01:00:24,241 --> 01:00:26,391
<i>Now her pulse is 53.</i>

892
01:00:27,401 --> 01:00:30,234
<i>No, I don't think it's a reaction.</i>

893
01:00:31,601 --> 01:00:33,592
<i>Oh, 27, 28 years old, I'd say.</i>

894
01:00:33,841 --> 01:00:37,231
<i>Thank you Doctor.
Yes, I'll wait here.</i>

895
01:00:37,521 --> 01:00:39,512
<i>Come directly up to my room.</i>

896
01:01:33,241 --> 01:01:35,550
Betty! You're still asleep?

897
01:01:36,001 --> 01:01:37,593
It's already one o'clock.

898
01:01:38,201 --> 01:01:41,113
The doctor's coming
at quarter-to-two.

899
01:01:41,601 --> 01:01:44,559
How about a wash
or something to eat?

900
01:01:45,241 --> 01:01:46,879
No, thank you, Laure.

901
01:01:47,801 --> 01:01:50,759
Be nice,
and shut the door behind you.

902
01:01:52,601 --> 01:01:54,239
Sure, if you like.

903
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:56,553
Sleep well.

904
01:02:05,681 --> 01:02:07,512
What are you thinking about?

905
01:02:07,721 --> 01:02:08,676
About you.

906
01:02:09,961 --> 01:02:12,270
- And?
- And what?

907
01:02:12,881 --> 01:02:15,190
And, what do you think about me?

908
01:02:20,441 --> 01:02:21,430
It's very complex.

909
01:02:26,921 --> 01:02:28,115
You're like my sister.

910
01:02:28,801 --> 01:02:29,870
What?

911
01:02:31,241 --> 01:02:33,471
When you preach at me.

912
01:02:38,281 --> 01:02:40,841
When you bug me, I think of her.

913
01:02:42,001 --> 01:02:44,390
What'd you do if I didn't come here?

914
01:02:45,441 --> 01:02:46,794
But you do come here.

915
01:02:47,001 --> 01:02:49,037
- I'd look for you!
- At my place?

916
01:02:49,241 --> 01:02:50,151
Well, yeah.

917
01:02:52,121 --> 01:02:53,315
And my husband?

918
01:03:04,001 --> 01:03:05,434
Betty, my dear,

919
01:03:05,641 --> 01:03:08,599
tonight I'm taking Mother
to the theatre.

920
01:03:08,921 --> 01:03:12,516
- Mother?
- Perfect! I adore Anouilh.

921
01:03:12,721 --> 01:03:15,030
My god! It's Elda's day off!

922
01:03:15,401 --> 01:03:19,474
That's all right.
I don't feel like the theatre.

923
01:03:19,681 --> 01:03:21,034
Well, I must go.

924
01:03:27,641 --> 01:03:29,040
See you tonight.

925
01:03:29,401 --> 01:03:32,120
- I've got to go.
- Stay 5 minutes.

926
01:03:32,361 --> 01:03:34,192
- You'll write me a note?
- A note?

927
01:03:34,401 --> 01:03:35,993
A joke, Mother.

928
01:03:37,881 --> 01:03:39,553
When does Elda get back?

929
01:03:41,241 --> 01:03:42,754
Not before midnight.

930
01:03:44,121 --> 01:03:46,510
The baby looks pale.

931
01:03:47,001 --> 01:03:48,320
We'll look after her.

932
01:03:48,521 --> 01:03:49,874
Won't we, Elizabeth?

933
01:03:50,441 --> 01:03:51,669
Of course, Mother.

934
01:03:52,761 --> 01:03:56,800
After my dentist appointment
I can pick the kids up

935
01:03:57,001 --> 01:03:57,717
at school.

936
01:03:57,921 --> 01:03:59,115
Fine.

937
01:04:04,361 --> 01:04:05,635
See you tonight.

938
01:04:23,801 --> 01:04:25,280
Betty!

939
01:04:25,481 --> 01:04:28,678
Can you go see?
I think I heard crying.

940
01:04:30,441 --> 01:04:31,874
Yes, Mother.

941
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:37,271
Don't get up, I'm going.

942
01:04:45,721 --> 01:04:46,915
<i>How was the dentist?</i>

943
01:04:48,681 --> 01:04:52,435
The same. You wait an hour,
and then he finds something wrong.

944
01:04:52,641 --> 01:04:54,632
Somehow, he always hurts you.

945
01:04:54,961 --> 01:04:56,155
I'm forever there.

946
01:04:56,361 --> 01:04:59,876
- After 10 years it hurts less.
- That reminds me,

947
01:05:00,081 --> 01:05:01,560
I have to make a call.

948
01:05:02,881 --> 01:05:06,351
I'll take the kids out
to give Granny some peace.

949
01:05:06,841 --> 01:05:08,240
They don't bother me!

950
01:05:08,441 --> 01:05:10,875
That's kind,
but it's better for them.

951
01:05:11,281 --> 01:05:14,273
Remember, Betty.
Dinner at our place!

952
01:05:14,881 --> 01:05:16,314
Of course!

953
01:05:17,081 --> 01:05:19,515
I can't talk. There are people here.

954
01:05:19,721 --> 01:05:23,999
I can't get out.
I'll call after dinner. Around nine.

955
01:05:39,361 --> 01:05:40,714
You won't be lonely?

956
01:05:40,921 --> 01:05:42,877
Don't be silly.

957
01:05:43,921 --> 01:05:45,115
Odile's just upstairs...

958
01:05:46,001 --> 01:05:48,879
Some company!
Hurry, you'll be late.

959
01:05:49,081 --> 01:05:50,036
The tickets, dear?

960
01:05:50,241 --> 01:05:51,879
I've got them, Mother.

961
01:06:00,681 --> 01:06:01,909
You can go. I'm fine.

962
01:06:02,121 --> 01:06:03,474
I can wait Madame.

963
01:06:03,681 --> 01:06:05,194
No, go on. Get some rest.

964
01:06:05,401 --> 01:06:06,914
Thank you. Good night.

965
01:06:23,401 --> 01:06:25,437
Hello! Hello! Is that you?

966
01:06:28,801 --> 01:06:30,200
Are you sad?

967
01:06:31,321 --> 01:06:34,518
Not that! If you knew
what I've been through!

968
01:06:34,761 --> 01:06:36,399
Think I've been laughing?

969
01:06:36,601 --> 01:06:37,795
<i>Did you miss me?</i>

970
01:06:38,601 --> 01:06:40,592
Listen. You know where I live.

971
01:06:41,001 --> 01:06:42,559
The kids are asleep.

972
01:06:42,761 --> 01:06:46,390
The nurse and maid are out,
my husband's at the theatre.

973
01:06:46,601 --> 01:06:47,716
<i>So?</i>

974
01:06:48,401 --> 01:06:49,880
Don't you understand?

975
01:06:51,361 --> 01:06:51,998
Yes.

976
01:06:52,601 --> 01:06:54,159
You don't seem thrilled.

977
01:06:54,761 --> 01:06:56,080
<i>Listen to me,</i>

978
01:06:56,361 --> 01:07:00,320
I've wanted this too long.
You'll see when you get here.

979
01:07:00,641 --> 01:07:01,756
Come.

980
01:07:02,561 --> 01:07:03,596
Okay.

981
01:07:08,281 --> 01:07:09,236
Come.

982
01:07:19,401 --> 01:07:21,312
- Are you afraid?
- No.

983
01:07:23,321 --> 01:07:25,198
Not happy to see where I live?

984
01:07:27,681 --> 01:07:28,716
You don't like it?

985
01:07:28,921 --> 01:07:29,956
Yes, yes.

986
01:07:33,001 --> 01:07:34,480
Well, I hate it.

987
01:07:34,761 --> 01:07:36,035
Come by me.

988
01:07:39,081 --> 01:07:40,799
What's wrong? What is it?

989
01:07:49,841 --> 01:07:53,629
- What about the kids?
- Their room's behind that door.

990
01:07:53,841 --> 01:07:55,035
Wait!

991
01:08:01,961 --> 01:08:04,839
There. If Charlotte wakes,
we'll hear.

992
01:08:15,201 --> 01:08:17,635
Don't be such a lump!

993
01:08:18,801 --> 01:08:20,678
We're going to enjoy this.

994
01:08:28,161 --> 01:08:31,312
I'll get Frédéric.
You lie down on the couch.

995
01:08:48,561 --> 01:08:50,313
No, no. Not on that!

996
01:08:57,361 --> 01:09:01,479
Hurry! My drops... my drops.
Give me 20 drops.

997
01:09:20,561 --> 01:09:23,200
Elizabeth! Guy wants to see you.

998
01:09:35,761 --> 01:09:38,116
In the salon. They want to see you.

999
01:09:40,081 --> 01:09:41,116
Come here.

1000
01:09:56,121 --> 01:09:57,520
You can sit down.

1001
01:10:06,001 --> 01:10:10,950
The counsellor has rushed over
to help me resolve this.

1002
01:10:11,361 --> 01:10:13,113
I know we were wrong,

1003
01:10:13,321 --> 01:10:16,757
Mother and I,
to return without warning,

1004
01:10:17,201 --> 01:10:19,476
but she was unwell.
You'll excuse us?

1005
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:20,717
Guy!

1006
01:10:23,761 --> 01:10:27,436
Write what the counsellor dictates.
I find it equitable.

1007
01:10:28,321 --> 01:10:30,073
Generous, in fact.

1008
01:10:31,241 --> 01:10:32,799
It's very simple:

1009
01:10:34,521 --> 01:10:36,193
You recognize your wrongs,

1010
01:10:38,881 --> 01:10:41,554
you renounce guardianship
of the children

1011
01:10:42,521 --> 01:10:44,637
as well as the right to see them.

1012
01:10:45,881 --> 01:10:48,953
In exchange, we guarantee,
financially speaking,

1013
01:10:49,441 --> 01:10:52,274
you won't be in any need.

1014
01:10:56,361 --> 01:10:57,840
Either accept

1015
01:10:58,241 --> 01:10:59,913
and all will be well,

1016
01:11:01,201 --> 01:11:02,953
or refuse, and it's war.

1017
01:11:03,161 --> 01:11:05,959
And it's a war you will never win.

1018
01:11:09,881 --> 01:11:11,360
What is it I have to do?

1019
01:11:14,961 --> 01:11:15,916
You write:

1020
01:11:16,121 --> 01:11:17,952
I, the undersigned,

1021
01:11:20,961 --> 01:11:22,679
Elizabeth Etamble...

1022
01:11:22,881 --> 01:11:24,075
<i>She wrote Betty.</i>

1023
01:11:24,281 --> 01:11:26,875
Ah, no. Not Betty! Elizabeth.

1024
01:11:37,041 --> 01:11:40,511
I, the undersigned,
Elizabeth Etamble

1025
01:11:41,961 --> 01:11:43,440
née Fayet,

1026
01:11:44,801 --> 01:11:46,951
28 years old, without profession,

1027
01:11:49,481 --> 01:11:52,279
residing at 6 Ave Ruysdaël, Paris,

1028
01:11:54,441 --> 01:11:57,399
do hereby state

1029
01:11:58,441 --> 01:12:02,559
that I accept without reservation
the conditions...

1030
01:12:06,521 --> 01:12:08,876
A check for your immediate needs.

1031
01:12:10,081 --> 01:12:11,992
When I have your address

1032
01:12:12,201 --> 01:12:15,591
I'll send your affairs
and my lawyer will contact you.

1033
01:12:24,601 --> 01:12:26,637
No, Betty. Please.

1034
01:12:28,281 --> 01:12:30,192
They're asleep.
They wouldn't understand.

1035
01:12:47,921 --> 01:12:49,274
<i>So, you're not well?</i>

1036
01:12:49,841 --> 01:12:53,072
What's the problem?
Well, we'll have a look.

1037
01:12:53,281 --> 01:12:55,351
May I? I'll wash my hands.

1038
01:13:00,481 --> 01:13:03,473
What has she had this morning?
Breakfast?

1039
01:13:03,961 --> 01:13:05,553
No, she wouldn't eat.

1040
01:13:05,761 --> 01:13:07,399
Not even coffee?

1041
01:13:07,601 --> 01:13:08,317
No.

1042
01:13:10,121 --> 01:13:11,713
Are you in much pain?

1043
01:13:12,841 --> 01:13:14,433
No pain anywhere?

1044
01:13:14,641 --> 01:13:17,474
No migraine, chest contractions?

1045
01:13:18,001 --> 01:13:19,229
You can stay if you like.

1046
01:13:19,441 --> 01:13:22,080
- It's all right.
- No. I have a call to make.

1047
01:13:30,441 --> 01:13:33,513
Is that you?
No, I'm at the hotel with Betty.

1048
01:13:33,721 --> 01:13:35,313
The doctor's examining her.

1049
01:13:35,521 --> 01:13:36,840
It's not serious.

1050
01:13:37,721 --> 01:13:39,552
Any drops in blood pressure?

1051
01:13:40,321 --> 01:13:42,118
No... Make it two hours.

1052
01:13:43,281 --> 01:13:44,191
Fine. I'll explain.

1053
01:13:44,481 --> 01:13:45,914
Right... See you later.

1054
01:13:46,321 --> 01:13:47,549
Love you.

1055
01:13:50,481 --> 01:13:51,880
Turn over.

1056
01:13:59,641 --> 01:14:01,154
Any dizzy spells?

1057
01:14:01,361 --> 01:14:03,431
I've had a few recently.

1058
01:14:03,881 --> 01:14:06,634
Serious enough to lose your balance?

1059
01:14:06,841 --> 01:14:08,718
No, not quite...

1060
01:14:11,201 --> 01:14:12,998
Any recent emotional shock?

1061
01:14:13,201 --> 01:14:14,270
Doctor.

1062
01:14:17,321 --> 01:14:21,837
We haven't behaved ourselves.
We've been drinking quite a bit.

1063
01:14:22,881 --> 01:14:27,557
I gave her 2 phenobarbitals
of 100 mgs and she slept calmly.

1064
01:14:27,761 --> 01:14:31,640
The phone woke her up.
She's been like this since then.

1065
01:14:34,281 --> 01:14:36,795
There's nothing wrong organically.

1066
01:14:37,441 --> 01:14:40,478
What you need is quiet
and complete rest.

1067
01:14:40,681 --> 01:14:43,912
- A clinic would be best.
- No. Not that!

1068
01:14:44,121 --> 01:14:46,715
I won't insist.

1069
01:14:46,961 --> 01:14:50,112
If you behave,
the hotel is as good as anywhere.

1070
01:14:50,601 --> 01:14:51,511
Do you have guests?

1071
01:14:51,721 --> 01:14:53,120
No, no one.

1072
01:14:53,321 --> 01:14:54,993
Fine. That's best.

1073
01:14:55,561 --> 01:14:59,349
All right. No going out
for 4 or 5 days. Don't eat,

1074
01:14:59,561 --> 01:15:02,633
except at night,
a light vegetable soup.

1075
01:15:02,841 --> 01:15:05,116
Peace and quiet. Understand?

1076
01:15:06,161 --> 01:15:07,037
Yes.

1077
01:15:07,361 --> 01:15:08,237
Good.

1078
01:15:08,561 --> 01:15:10,074
Now, turn over.

1079
01:15:11,481 --> 01:15:13,517
I'm giving you a shot.

1080
01:15:23,401 --> 01:15:24,675
No, Betty. Please.

1081
01:15:26,001 --> 01:15:27,878
They're asleep.
They wouldn't understand.

1082
01:15:38,561 --> 01:15:41,439
- Ice?
- Yeah. Make it a double.

1083
01:15:45,081 --> 01:15:46,400
With soda?

1084
01:15:47,001 --> 01:15:48,798
I don't care... No.

1085
01:15:52,641 --> 01:15:54,074
Give me another.

1086
01:16:17,481 --> 01:16:18,072
Don't bother.

1087
01:16:18,281 --> 01:16:20,351
- He's not there.
- He's not back?

1088
01:16:20,721 --> 01:16:21,676
He came back and left.

1089
01:16:22,361 --> 01:16:26,912
With his bag and his instrument,
like he was in a rush.

1090
01:16:27,441 --> 01:16:29,477
And he said to rent the studio.

1091
01:17:01,721 --> 01:17:03,473
Isn't Philippe here?

1092
01:17:03,881 --> 01:17:05,360
Philippe? The saxophone?

1093
01:17:05,561 --> 01:17:06,357
Yeah.

1094
01:17:14,881 --> 01:17:18,191
I don't see him.
He must have got a replacement.

1095
01:17:20,561 --> 01:17:21,914
Buy you a drink?

1096
01:17:23,281 --> 01:17:24,600
- If you like.
- I'd like to.

1097
01:17:24,801 --> 01:17:25,756
What'll it be?

1098
01:17:25,961 --> 01:17:27,235
A whisky.

1099
01:17:28,201 --> 01:17:31,637
A whisky. Cloclo, a double whisky
for the lovely lady.

1100
01:17:32,961 --> 01:17:33,598
Ice?

1101
01:17:34,481 --> 01:17:35,436
Yeah.

1102
01:17:37,321 --> 01:17:38,595
Soda?

1103
01:17:39,361 --> 01:17:40,840
I don't care...

1104
01:17:41,201 --> 01:17:42,077
No.

1105
01:17:43,361 --> 01:17:45,113
What's your name, my beauty?

1106
01:17:45,521 --> 01:17:46,078
Betty.

1107
01:17:48,001 --> 01:17:49,195
It's over there!

1108
01:17:54,361 --> 01:17:55,794
Through here!

1109
01:18:04,721 --> 01:18:05,915
Is Number 3 free, Maria?

1110
01:18:06,121 --> 01:18:07,793
Right away, Madame.

1111
01:18:08,161 --> 01:18:09,594
Go ahead!

1112
01:18:32,841 --> 01:18:34,069
Strip off!

1113
01:18:37,361 --> 01:18:38,840
On your feet, my girl.

1114
01:18:39,241 --> 01:18:40,754
Cut the shit. The hour's over.

1115
01:18:41,481 --> 01:18:42,755
I want to sleep. Sleep.

1116
01:18:42,961 --> 01:18:44,474
But not here.

1117
01:18:44,721 --> 01:18:47,189
Move it or Mr Charles'll take over.

1118
01:18:47,641 --> 01:18:51,429
Don't want to leave?
I'll kick your ass outta here!

1119
01:18:51,641 --> 01:18:55,270
I bet your papers aren't right.
And I don't like that!

1120
01:18:55,481 --> 01:18:56,630
Move it!

1121
01:18:57,841 --> 01:18:59,752
Take your things with you!
I need the room!

1122
01:19:01,761 --> 01:19:04,036
Just what we need to get hassled!

1123
01:19:22,121 --> 01:19:25,318
He's just a poor kid, see,
and he was terrified.

1124
01:19:25,521 --> 01:19:28,399
If I don't find him
he won't come back.

1125
01:19:29,001 --> 01:19:30,195
He's scared of Guy.

1126
01:19:31,441 --> 01:19:34,672
Guy? He doesn't give a shit!
You know what?

1127
01:19:35,121 --> 01:19:36,952
I'm sure he knew all along!

1128
01:19:37,681 --> 01:19:38,716
You all right? Happy?

1129
01:19:43,121 --> 01:19:44,918
Where you taking me?

1130
01:19:45,961 --> 01:19:47,474
<i>You're not taking me?</i>

1131
01:19:47,681 --> 01:19:50,115
Me? Where you want me
to take you?

1132
01:19:51,521 --> 01:19:53,193
You don't know where to go?

1133
01:19:54,641 --> 01:19:55,596
No.

1134
01:19:56,761 --> 01:19:58,831
You're not a thief, are you?

1135
01:20:01,241 --> 01:20:02,993
How about my place?

1136
01:20:04,121 --> 01:20:06,032
We could go to my place, huh?

1137
01:21:13,761 --> 01:21:15,638
Quiet. I think she's asleep.

1138
01:21:15,841 --> 01:21:18,719
No, wait. I want to make sure.

1139
01:22:08,121 --> 01:22:09,634
What else did she say?

1140
01:22:09,841 --> 01:22:12,150
So much I can't remember it all.

1141
01:22:12,841 --> 01:22:14,513
She's a poor lost soul.

1142
01:22:14,721 --> 01:22:18,430
She'll spend her life looking,
not knowing what for.

1143
01:22:18,641 --> 01:22:20,199
There are times

1144
01:22:20,521 --> 01:22:22,477
she looks like a stray dog.

1145
01:22:25,521 --> 01:22:27,751
But sometimes her eyes...

1146
01:22:28,561 --> 01:22:31,155
are completely blank.
There's no expression.

1147
01:22:32,041 --> 01:22:35,556
- Do you think she's cold?
- No, the poor thing.

1148
01:22:39,001 --> 01:22:40,036
Maybe she'll wind up

1149
01:22:40,241 --> 01:22:44,439
getting adopted like a stray dog
by a Good Samaritan.

1150
01:23:46,081 --> 01:23:47,309
So, is she asleep?

1151
01:23:48,281 --> 01:23:49,191
So it seems.

1152
01:23:50,281 --> 01:23:52,237
You see? What did I tell you?

1153
01:23:52,761 --> 01:23:54,274
Give me a drink.

1154
01:24:17,801 --> 01:24:20,759
Don't bother, angel, I'll get it.

1155
01:24:23,601 --> 01:24:25,796
No, this is Laure Levaucher.

1156
01:24:30,201 --> 01:24:33,034
A Mr. Etamble
wants to speak to you.

1157
01:24:33,241 --> 01:24:36,233
It might be Frédéric.
Ask his first name.

1158
01:24:36,441 --> 01:24:38,432
That's not so easy.

1159
01:24:39,521 --> 01:24:41,910
Which Mr. Etamble, may I ask?

1160
01:24:43,841 --> 01:24:44,751
Your husband.

1161
01:24:46,361 --> 01:24:50,559
- Should he come up?
- No, no! I don't want him up here!

1162
01:24:50,761 --> 01:24:52,877
Tell him I'm coming down.

1163
01:24:53,081 --> 01:24:54,275
But the doctor said...

1164
01:24:54,481 --> 01:24:57,917
I don't want him here.
Anyway, I feel all right.

1165
01:24:58,121 --> 01:25:02,080
No, tell him I'll meet him
downstairs in half an hour.

1166
01:25:20,681 --> 01:25:22,080
Am I disturbing you?

1167
01:25:23,881 --> 01:25:25,439
No, of course not.

1168
01:25:25,641 --> 01:25:29,111
Florent hardly recognized
your voice on the phone.

1169
01:25:29,881 --> 01:25:32,759
I was afraid
you were sick or something.

1170
01:25:32,961 --> 01:25:36,510
I was tired, that's all.
I'm better now.

1171
01:25:36,721 --> 01:25:38,439
Have you seen a doctor?

1172
01:25:38,761 --> 01:25:39,876
What did he say?

1173
01:25:40,081 --> 01:25:42,151
I'll be okay in 3 or 4 days.

1174
01:25:42,481 --> 01:25:44,437
Can't we go outside?

1175
01:25:44,681 --> 01:25:46,433
Is someone looking after you?

1176
01:25:46,921 --> 01:25:48,070
<i>A girl friend.</i>

1177
01:25:59,161 --> 01:26:00,071
Are the kids well?

1178
01:26:00,281 --> 01:26:02,954
Yes, but Charlotte has a cold

1179
01:26:03,161 --> 01:26:05,470
and she's furious
about being kept in.

1180
01:26:10,001 --> 01:26:11,639
Is your mother back in Lyon?

1181
01:26:12,401 --> 01:26:13,595
Tomorrow.

1182
01:26:19,481 --> 01:26:21,039
I wanted to talk about

1183
01:26:22,481 --> 01:26:23,675
the paper you signed.

1184
01:26:23,881 --> 01:26:25,030
I...

1185
01:26:26,241 --> 01:26:27,959
I don't intend
to use it right away.

1186
01:26:28,921 --> 01:26:32,994
I was really worried
about not having heard from you.

1187
01:26:33,441 --> 01:26:35,238
That's what Florent told me.

1188
01:26:35,641 --> 01:26:39,316
I asked him to call
and arrange to meet you.

1189
01:26:39,881 --> 01:26:41,678
But you refused, so...

1190
01:26:42,321 --> 01:26:43,959
I wanted to get better first.

1191
01:26:46,641 --> 01:26:47,756
Had a breakdown?

1192
01:26:47,961 --> 01:26:50,714
I don't know.
Anyway, it's not serious.

1193
01:26:53,321 --> 01:26:54,117
Well, look...

1194
01:26:54,321 --> 01:26:58,200
In a situation like this,
we can't rush things.

1195
01:26:58,401 --> 01:27:02,076
We have to think this out carefully.

1196
01:27:02,401 --> 01:27:04,119
We're not alone in this.

1197
01:27:05,681 --> 01:27:07,478
We debated it a long time,

1198
01:27:08,241 --> 01:27:12,314
Mother, Frédéric and I.
You may not think it's the best way.

1199
01:27:12,801 --> 01:27:15,759
But you can see that it would

1200
01:27:16,081 --> 01:27:19,960
be difficult for you
to come home right away.

1201
01:27:20,601 --> 01:27:24,150
But you can't stay alone.
You are alone here?

1202
01:27:24,401 --> 01:27:28,519
- Weren't you told at the desk?
- No... yes. I knew.

1203
01:27:30,201 --> 01:27:34,399
We thought as an experiment,
you might go with Mother to Lyon.

1204
01:27:34,601 --> 01:27:38,560
But you can stay here
a little longer. There's no rush.

1205
01:27:39,681 --> 01:27:42,036
You can live with her a while.

1206
01:27:43,641 --> 01:27:46,280
And then, later on...

1207
01:27:47,161 --> 01:27:48,753
Was this your idea?

1208
01:27:50,081 --> 01:27:52,720
We all... discussed it.

1209
01:27:55,801 --> 01:27:57,757
You... thought I'd accept?

1210
01:27:57,961 --> 01:27:59,314
I don't know.

1211
01:27:59,641 --> 01:28:01,120
I don't know now.

1212
01:28:02,041 --> 01:28:03,110
You want that?

1213
01:28:03,321 --> 01:28:04,913
I'm thinking of the children.

1214
01:28:06,321 --> 01:28:08,039
And I'm thinking of you too.

1215
01:28:08,281 --> 01:28:13,116
Thank you, Guy. I'm really touched
by your gesture, really I am.

1216
01:28:13,321 --> 01:28:17,200
The same goes for your mother.
Thank her for me.

1217
01:28:20,121 --> 01:28:21,315
Then it's no?

1218
01:28:21,641 --> 01:28:22,960
It's better this way.

1219
01:28:23,161 --> 01:28:25,880
Not so much for me
as for all of you.

1220
01:28:26,601 --> 01:28:29,479
I warned you. Remember?

1221
01:28:30,721 --> 01:28:32,837
But you wouldn't listen.

1222
01:28:35,161 --> 01:28:37,277
But I'm glad you came.

1223
01:28:37,641 --> 01:28:40,280
It's better to part this way.

1224
01:28:41,001 --> 01:28:42,400
Hey kid, you getting romantic?

1225
01:28:46,441 --> 01:28:48,716
I'll call Florent in a few days.

1226
01:28:49,281 --> 01:28:50,999
Get going, now.

1227
01:28:52,521 --> 01:28:54,512
And don't forget
to thank your mother.

1228
01:28:57,601 --> 01:29:00,161
It's not my fault if I hurt you.

1229
01:29:01,001 --> 01:29:03,276
But I'm asking you to forgive me.

1230
01:29:03,841 --> 01:29:04,512
Get going, now.

1231
01:29:04,721 --> 01:29:06,518
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

1232
01:29:06,921 --> 01:29:07,831
Go on.

1233
01:29:10,121 --> 01:29:11,713
You don't need anything?

1234
01:29:12,281 --> 01:29:13,999
No, nothing at all.

1235
01:29:15,561 --> 01:29:17,392
Good luck, Betty.

1236
01:29:17,601 --> 01:29:18,829
Thanks.

1237
01:29:19,601 --> 01:29:21,432
You too, Guy.

1238
01:29:38,601 --> 01:29:39,829
Thanks.

1239
01:29:52,201 --> 01:29:53,316
So, how'd it go?

1240
01:29:53,521 --> 01:29:54,715
Just fine.

1241
01:29:55,081 --> 01:29:56,400
He asked me back.

1242
01:29:56,601 --> 01:29:57,636
Oh, really?

1243
01:29:59,121 --> 01:30:00,076
And what did you say?

1244
01:30:00,281 --> 01:30:01,555
I said no.

1245
01:30:03,641 --> 01:30:04,676
It's over.

1246
01:30:04,881 --> 01:30:05,996
Feel up to it?

1247
01:30:07,681 --> 01:30:09,956
Oh, yes. Can I have a cigarette?

1248
01:30:19,881 --> 01:30:21,951
Can I leave you?
I have things to do.

1249
01:30:22,161 --> 01:30:23,230
And you're okay now.

1250
01:30:23,481 --> 01:30:25,358
Don't worry.

1251
01:30:25,561 --> 01:30:27,756
Anyway, you've played
the nursemaid long enough.

1252
01:30:27,961 --> 01:30:28,916
No, not at all.

1253
01:30:29,121 --> 01:30:30,315
Going to The Hole?

1254
01:30:30,521 --> 01:30:34,833
No, Paris. I'm seeing my banker
and accountant.

1255
01:30:35,041 --> 01:30:36,952
Lots of very exciting people.

1256
01:30:37,881 --> 01:30:39,314
Well, I'll be running along.

1257
01:30:39,641 --> 01:30:41,518
If there's a problem, call Mario.

1258
01:30:42,761 --> 01:30:44,194
See you tonight.

1259
01:30:45,801 --> 01:30:46,756
Try to rest.

1260
01:30:48,361 --> 01:30:49,680
Goodbye, Laure.

1261
01:31:31,481 --> 01:31:32,596
Mario.

1262
01:31:35,521 --> 01:31:37,751
It's you. You're here.

1263
01:31:38,001 --> 01:31:39,229
Ah, it's so good.

1264
01:32:29,561 --> 01:32:30,789
Afraid?

1265
01:32:31,801 --> 01:32:32,597
No.

1266
01:32:42,321 --> 01:32:43,993
I have to go to The Hole.

1267
01:32:44,201 --> 01:32:45,520
I'm coming along.

1268
01:32:46,521 --> 01:32:48,830
No way: The doc said...

1269
01:32:50,601 --> 01:32:53,115
He doesn't know
what it is to be a woman.

1270
01:33:04,041 --> 01:33:06,271
I've never been happier. And you?

1271
01:33:06,481 --> 01:33:07,550
I'm happy.

1272
01:33:51,081 --> 01:33:53,231
- Where do you live?
- Over the club.

1273
01:33:53,441 --> 01:33:55,113
It's an old farm.

1274
01:33:55,321 --> 01:33:56,720
It's all beams.

1275
01:34:04,801 --> 01:34:07,235
We'll have champagne tonight.

1276
01:34:08,441 --> 01:34:09,590
Okay?

1277
01:34:10,441 --> 01:34:13,035
And I won't drink too much.
I promise.

1278
01:35:09,761 --> 01:35:13,515
Have my bill sent to Lyon.
You have the address?

1279
01:35:13,721 --> 01:35:18,112
No problem, Madame.
We hope to see you again soon.

1280
01:35:18,841 --> 01:35:19,876
Goodbye, François.

1281
01:35:20,081 --> 01:35:21,799
Goodbye, Madame. Thank you.

1282
01:35:52,921 --> 01:35:54,400
<i>LYON</i>

1283
01:36:04,241 --> 01:36:05,515
Remember Madame Levaucher?

1284
01:36:07,801 --> 01:36:09,519
Laure Levaucher?

1285
01:36:09,921 --> 01:36:11,115
The Professor's widow?

1286
01:36:11,321 --> 01:36:13,710
Yes. She just died.

1287
01:36:14,201 --> 01:36:16,192
Her maid
found her dead in bed.

1288
01:36:16,521 --> 01:36:17,749
It's in the paper.

1289
01:36:19,921 --> 01:36:22,276
Didn't she leave Lyon
a long time ago?

1290
01:36:23,361 --> 01:36:24,510
To live in Paris?

1291
01:36:24,801 --> 01:36:29,829
Versailles. But she kept
her apartment here for visits.

1292
01:36:31,201 --> 01:36:32,156
Was she sick?

1293
01:36:33,041 --> 01:36:34,156
They didn't say.

1294
01:36:36,081 --> 01:36:38,037
She wasn't all that old.

1295
01:36:39,161 --> 01:36:40,071
Forty-nine.

1296
01:36:41,401 --> 01:36:42,914
That's not old!

1297
01:36:44,961 --> 01:36:46,997
How are your children?

1298
01:36:48,201 --> 01:36:51,398
Just fine. Very happy.

1299
01:36:51,961 --> 01:36:54,270
Guy's children are adorable.

1300
01:36:54,841 --> 01:36:57,196
But that poor Laure Levaucher.

1301
01:36:57,401 --> 01:37:01,076
I used to run into her
from time to time.

1302
01:37:02,201 --> 01:37:05,591
A beautiful woman,
always rather pale.

1303
01:37:06,561 --> 01:37:08,552
But I never thought she was sick.

1304
01:37:16,041 --> 01:37:20,637
<i>She could never have known
that Laure had died</i>

1305
01:37:20,841 --> 01:37:24,151
<i>because Betty had survived.
