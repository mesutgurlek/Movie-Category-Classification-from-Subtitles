(GENTLE CLASSICAL PIECE)

3
00:03:40,728 --> 00:03:44,227
Good morning, your Highness.

4
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,939
Good morning, your Highness.

5
00:03:48,152 --> 00:03:51,438
Good morning, your Highness.

6
00:03:51,656 --> 00:03:57,860
- Happy birthday, your Highness.
- Yes, it is my birthday.

7
00:04:36,784 --> 00:04:39,192
Oha, it is my 21st birthday.

8
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:43,908
Do you think, just once,
I might use the bathroom by myself?

9
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:47,957
Most amusing, sir.
Wipers!

10
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:09,310
The royal penis is clean,
your Highness.

11
00:06:05,373 --> 00:06:09,536
His Highness
must be very excited today.

12
00:06:09,752 --> 00:06:13,536
Today is your 21st birthday.
It means you meet your wife-to-be.

13
00:06:13,756 --> 00:06:17,006
How can a man get excited
about a woman he's never seen?

14
00:07:00,469 --> 00:07:03,340
He certainly is quiet this morning.

15
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:06,261
He looks sad.

16
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:14,515
- Is something troubling you, my son?
- No, Father.

17
00:07:15,943 --> 00:07:22,278
I'm more than the exalted ruler
of this land and master of all I survey.

18
00:07:22,491 --> 00:07:25,362
I'm also a concerned dad.

19
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:31,869
Well, Father... Just a moment.

20
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:36,129
- What is he doing?
- It looks as if he's coming here.

21
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:39,879
Wait right there, Akeem.

22
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:41,884
Rose bearers!

23
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:52,180
Akeem. Come sit.

24
00:08:04,659 --> 00:08:08,407
Now, my son...
Have you grown a moustache?

25
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:11,491
Jaffe, it has been a year.

26
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:17,661
- So, what is it, my son?
- First of all, things like this.

27
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,881
- Like what?
- The rose petals.

28
00:08:21,092 --> 00:08:25,801
You're the son of a king, why shouldn't
you walk on the petals of roses?

29
00:08:26,013 --> 00:08:29,429
But if there were no rose petals,
I would still be the son of a king.

30
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:32,845
Then it is settled. From this day forth,

31
00:08:33,062 --> 00:08:38,816
anyone who throws roses
at my son's feet will answer to me.

32
00:08:39,026 --> 00:08:41,517
It is not just that, it is everything.

33
00:08:41,737 --> 00:08:46,233
The cooking, the pampering,
the dressing, the bathing...

34
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:49,120
Actually, I rather enjoy the bathing,

35
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:54,121
but I'd like to cook for myself,
dress myself, wipe my own backside.

36
00:08:54,333 --> 00:09:00,004
- And why can't I find my own wife?
- Aha! So that's it?

37
00:09:00,214 --> 00:09:05,042
We've gone through a lot of trouble
to select for you a very fine wife.

38
00:09:05,261 --> 00:09:10,421
Since she was born, she was taught
to walk, speak and think as a queen.

39
00:09:12,727 --> 00:09:14,600
But what if I don't love her?

40
00:09:14,812 --> 00:09:17,979
It's normal to feel anxiety
about meeting your queen.

41
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,812
When I met your father, I was terrified.

42
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:23,981
I must admit, I was frightened, too.

43
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:27,612
I was so nervous, I became nauseous.

44
00:09:27,825 --> 00:09:31,870
But over the years, I have grown
to love your father very much.

45
00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:36,540
You see, my son, there's a fine line
between love and nausea.

46
00:09:36,751 --> 00:09:39,870
I understand, but when I marry,

47
00:09:40,087 --> 00:09:44,251
I want the woman to love me
for who I am, not because of what I am.

48
00:09:44,467 --> 00:09:48,714
- And who are you?
- A man who's never tied his shoes.

49
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:53,508
Wrong! You're a prince
who's never tied his shoes.

50
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:59,266
I tied my own shoes once.
It is an overrated experience.

51
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:04,983
Good morning, your Majesty.
It's another beautiful day in Zamunda.

52
00:10:05,196 --> 00:10:07,734
And, Semmi, what is it now?

53
00:10:10,451 --> 00:10:14,318
You look especially radiant today,
your Grace.

54
00:10:14,538 --> 00:10:20,577
I was remarking to my mother the other
day what lovely skin the Queen has.

55
00:10:20,795 --> 00:10:23,879
Semmi, don't you have somewhere
you should go?

56
00:10:25,508 --> 00:10:29,043
Yes, I was about to take the birthday
boy for his daily workout.

57
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:32,179
Excuse me, Father. And Mother.

58
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:38,269
Have a good day, my son.

59
00:10:40,648 --> 00:10:43,483
Akeem, what happened
to the rose bearers?

60
00:10:46,696 --> 00:10:51,903
Let's see if you can defend yourself,
you sweat from a baboon's balls.

61
00:11:12,388 --> 00:11:15,508
So you can have a woman
who will obey your every command,

62
00:11:15,725 --> 00:11:19,176
but you'd rather have a woman
who has an opinion?

63
00:11:19,395 --> 00:11:23,856
Only dogs are to obey. If you love
your wife, you'll value her opinion.

64
00:11:30,948 --> 00:11:34,732
Hippopotamus shit! You're the heir
to the throne of Zamunda.

65
00:11:34,952 --> 00:11:40,788
Your wife need only have a pretty face,
firm backside and big breasts.

66
00:11:55,056 --> 00:11:58,888
So you would share your bed,
and your fortune, with a beautiful fool?

67
00:11:59,101 --> 00:12:03,348
That's the way it's always been
with men of power. It's tradition.

68
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:10,526
It's also tradition
that times must change.

71

I am Colonel Issy.

73
00:13:34,822 --> 00:13:41,074
And today, with your blessing,
I offer my daughter to your son.

74
00:13:43,914 --> 00:13:48,411
My blessing is granted.
Let the courtship commence.

75
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:55,247
Pardon me. Step aside, please. Coming
through. Excuse me. Out of the way!

- So...
- Am I not all you dreamed I would be?

You're fine. Beautiful.

95
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:27,063
But if we're going to be married, we
should talk and get to know each other.

96
00:18:27,281 --> 00:18:31,742
Ever since I was born,
I have been trained to serve you.

97
00:18:31,953 --> 00:18:36,579
I know, but I'd like to know about you.
What do you like to do?

- Whatever kind of music you like.

I like, 'cause you were trained to know,

101
00:18:50,304 --> 00:18:53,507
but I would like to know what you like.
Do you have a favourite food?

- Yes.
- Good! What is your favourite food?

No.

Are you saying that no matter
what I tell you to do, you will do?

Yes, your Highness.

- Anything I say, you'll do?
- Yes, your Highness.

The guests are waiting, your Majesty.

121

Let them wait! I'm talking to my son.

122
00:20:23,064 --> 00:20:25,389
Come. Let's go for a stroll.

123
00:20:38,496 --> 00:20:41,165
Hello, Babar.

124
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:52,044
Time flies. It seems only yesterday
I ordered your first diaper changed,

125
00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:56,388
and now you're a man
who's about to be married.

126
00:20:56,597 --> 00:21:00,298
She will give you much pleasure,
don't you think?

127
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,682
I'm not sure if I'm ready.

128
00:21:04,647 --> 00:21:07,517
I know we never had a talk about this,

129
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:12,941
but I always assumed you had sex
with your bathers. I know I do.

130
00:21:13,155 --> 00:21:19,075
It's not that. I'm 21 years old,
and I have never left Zamunda.

131
00:21:19,287 --> 00:21:23,331
I have yet to experience
what the outside world has to offer.

132
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:27,408
- So you want to sow your royal oats?
- No, it's not that...

133
00:21:27,628 --> 00:21:31,377
You're right! Get out, see the world.
Enjoy yourself.

134
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:36,929
Fulfil every erotic desire,
and in 40 days, you will marry Imani.

135
00:21:37,138 --> 00:21:40,055
- But, Father...
- It is settled.

136
00:21:55,239 --> 00:21:58,110
May I have your attention, please?

137
00:21:59,619 --> 00:22:03,747
The wedding will proceed in 40 days.
You may go home now. Good night.

138
00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:07,954
Oha. Prepare the royal baggage.
My son is going on a trip.

139
00:22:11,255 --> 00:22:14,126
Prepare the royal baggage!

140
00:22:17,219 --> 00:22:20,802
This trip is an excellent idea.
40 days of fornication.

141
00:22:21,015 --> 00:22:27,018
Semmi. I have something else in mind.
I intend to find my bride.

142
00:22:28,022 --> 00:22:33,099
What is wrong with the one you have?
Didn't you want to rip her clothes off?

143
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:36,770
I want a woman who will arouse
my intellect as well as my loins.

144
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:39,943
- Where would you find such a woman?
- In America.

145
00:22:43,579 --> 00:22:46,414
The land is so big,
the choices so infinite.

146
00:22:46,624 --> 00:22:50,953
Where shall we go?
Los Angeles or New York?

147
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,875
We'll let fate decide.

148
00:22:56,175 --> 00:22:58,927
Heads, New York. Tails, Los Angeles.

149
00:23:01,973 --> 00:23:04,808
We go to New York.

150
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:09,395
But where in New York can one find
a woman with grace and elegance?

151
00:23:09,605 --> 00:23:12,227
A woman suitable for a king.

152
00:23:15,903 --> 00:23:17,445
Queens!

No one here can know I am royalty.
I must appear as an average man.

155
00:23:48,352 --> 00:23:51,057
I will not say a word.

156
00:24:04,952 --> 00:24:07,028
Halt!

157
00:24:07,788 --> 00:24:10,540
You dumb fuck!

158
00:24:15,046 --> 00:24:17,667
Take us to Queens at once.

159
00:24:21,302 --> 00:24:26,509
Do you want to go to Queens?
Rich fellows should be in Manhattan.

160
00:24:26,724 --> 00:24:28,763
Stay at the Waldorf or the Palace.

161
00:24:28,976 --> 00:24:32,844
- Take us to the Palace.
- No, I want Queens.

162
00:24:33,064 --> 00:24:37,108
And we're not rich.
We're ordinary African students.

163
00:24:37,318 --> 00:24:40,188
Whatever you say, pal.

164
00:24:40,404 --> 00:24:45,778
- What part of Queens do you want?
- Take us to the most common part.

165
00:24:46,535 --> 00:24:51,826
That's easy. If there's one thing
Queens got a lot of, it's common parts.

166
00:24:54,251 --> 00:24:56,374
What does "dumb fuck" mean?

167
00:25:26,951 --> 00:25:30,486
- Is this shitty enough for you?
- Yes, this is perfect.

168
00:26:07,116 --> 00:26:11,577
Fascinating! Semmi, look at this.

169
00:26:14,206 --> 00:26:19,830
America is great indeed. A country so
free, one can throw glass on the street.

170
00:26:20,046 --> 00:26:23,545
<i>You must be</i>
<i>out of your goddamn mind!</i>

171
00:26:25,593 --> 00:26:27,217
Listen. Real Americans.

172
00:26:28,971 --> 00:26:31,593
Sugar Ray Robinson's
the greatest fighter that ever lived.

173
00:26:31,807 --> 00:26:35,176
- What about Joe Louis?
- "The Brown Bomber".

174
00:26:35,394 --> 00:26:38,680
- That was a great boxer.
- You're damn right.

175
00:26:38,898 --> 00:26:41,768
I suppose nobody in here
ever heard of Cassius Clay.

176
00:26:41,984 --> 00:26:44,689
He's got a point. Cassius Clay
was a bad motherfucker.

177
00:26:44,904 --> 00:26:46,279
I ain't saying Clay ain't bad.

178
00:26:46,489 --> 00:26:51,281
I stopped liking him when he changed
his name to Muhammad Ali.

179
00:26:51,494 --> 00:26:53,570
Wait a second. Wait a second.

180
00:26:53,788 --> 00:26:59,030
A man has the right to change his name
to whatever he wants to change it to.

181
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:02,502
And if a man wants to be called
Muhammad Ali,

182
00:27:02,713 --> 00:27:08,586
you should respect his wishes
and call the man Muhammad Ali.

183
00:27:08,803 --> 00:27:12,468
His momma named him Clay.
I'm going to call him Clay.

184
00:27:12,682 --> 00:27:16,015
- I say Clay.
- Get out of here.

185
00:27:16,227 --> 00:27:21,565
He'll always be Clay to me. I don't
care what he change his name to.

186
00:27:21,774 --> 00:27:25,024
Well, then you're a putz.
The three of you. Three putzes.

187
00:27:25,236 --> 00:27:29,945
You should change the name from
"My-T-Sharp" to "The Three Putzes".

188
00:27:41,836 --> 00:27:46,047
- What the fuck do you want?
- We desire a room.

189
00:27:46,257 --> 00:27:49,875
You'd better not be wasting my time.
You got money?

190
00:27:51,971 --> 00:27:54,047
Come on in, gentlemen.

191
00:27:56,809 --> 00:27:59,596
Yo, man! Get the big bag.

192
00:28:03,733 --> 00:28:09,319
Excuse me if I was brusque, but we
get boo-boos in here without a dollar.

193
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:13,658
Obviously, you gentlemen
came in on another boat.

194
00:28:13,868 --> 00:28:17,367
- We seek meagre accommodations.
- Excuse me?

195
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:20,118
We require a room that is very poor.

196
00:28:25,254 --> 00:28:27,923
Hey, Stu.
Your rent's due, motherfucker.

197
00:28:28,132 --> 00:28:33,506
And don't pull that falling down the stairs
shit on me. You're conscious.

198
00:28:33,721 --> 00:28:36,971
Every month, the same damn thing...

199
00:28:54,241 --> 00:28:56,697
Here we are.

200
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:02,531
There's only one bathroom on this floor,
so you have to share it.

201
00:29:05,169 --> 00:29:10,508
Got a bit of an insect problem, but
you boys from Africa are used to that.

202
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:15,839
And don't use the elevator.
It's a death trap.

203
00:29:16,055 --> 00:29:20,681
This is the place that I was
telling you about. It's real fucked up.

204
00:29:20,893 --> 00:29:25,935
The window faces a brick wall.
I used to rent it to a blind man.

205
00:29:34,615 --> 00:29:38,529
It's a damn shame
what they did to that dog.

206
00:29:44,041 --> 00:29:46,200
We will take the room.

207
00:29:46,419 --> 00:29:48,791
Yes.

208
00:30:03,602 --> 00:30:06,936
Behold, Semmi! Life. Real life.

209
00:30:07,148 --> 00:30:10,682
A thing that we have been denied
for far too long.

210
00:30:12,903 --> 00:30:16,237
- <i>Good morning</i>, <i>my neighbours!</i>
- <i>Fuck you!</i>

211
00:30:16,449 --> 00:30:21,574
Yes! Yes! Fuck you, too!

212
00:30:40,556 --> 00:30:44,850
I suspect that these are the people
that have stolen our luggage.

213
00:30:50,274 --> 00:30:52,101
Do you want to buy
some toothbrushes?

214
00:30:52,318 --> 00:30:57,525
I've got some real fly personal
hygiene products, and a hair-dryer.

215
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:01,239
Thief! Stop thief! Come back, thief!

216
00:31:01,452 --> 00:31:04,488
- Semmi, let him go.
- Those things belong to us.

217
00:31:04,705 --> 00:31:08,917
It's good we're rid of those things.
Let them wear our princely robes.

218
00:31:09,126 --> 00:31:13,254
We're in New York now.
Let us dress as New Yorkers.

219
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:24,131
- I feel like a complete idiot.
- Don't be ridiculous.

220
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:30,768
<i>You know</i>, <i>you can be all the things</i>
<i>you've always wanted to be.</i>

221
00:31:30,982 --> 00:31:33,936
<i>Beautiful</i>, <i>sexy...</i>

222
00:31:34,568 --> 00:31:37,486
<i>One</i>, <i>two</i>, <i>three...</i>

223
00:31:37,697 --> 00:31:40,188
<i>(SOUL GLO JINGLE PLAYS)</i>

224
00:32:02,346 --> 00:32:04,553
Perhaps I should cut off
my prince's lock.

225
00:32:06,726 --> 00:32:10,059
You're out of your mind! Joe Louis
is the greatest boxer that ever lived.

226
00:32:10,271 --> 00:32:11,682
I'll be with you in a minute.

227
00:32:11,897 --> 00:32:17,484
He was better than Clay, Sugar Ray
and that new boy - Mike Tyson.

228
00:32:17,695 --> 00:32:20,898
He was better than him, too.
He'd whip all their asses!

229
00:32:21,782 --> 00:32:25,946
- What about Rocky Marciano?
- There they go. There they go.

230
00:32:26,162 --> 00:32:31,073
Every time I talk about boxing, a white
man pulls Rocky Marciano out his ass.

231
00:32:31,292 --> 00:32:34,577
That's their one, that's their one.
"Rocky Marciano, Rocky Marciano!"

232
00:32:34,795 --> 00:32:37,749
Let me tell you something.
Rocky Marciano was good,

233
00:32:37,965 --> 00:32:41,464
but compared to Joe Louis,
Rocky Marciano ain't shit!

234
00:32:41,677 --> 00:32:43,966
He beat Joe Louis' ass.

235
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:48,925
- He did whop Joe Louis' ass.
- Joe Louis was 75 years old!

236
00:32:49,143 --> 00:32:51,100
I don't know how old he was,
but he got his ass whooped.

237
00:32:51,312 --> 00:32:55,475
Joe Louis came out of retirement
to fight Marciano. He was 76 years old.

238
00:32:55,691 --> 00:32:58,396
Joe Louis always lied about his age.

239
00:32:58,611 --> 00:33:00,769
Once, Frank Sinatra sat in this chair.

240
00:33:00,988 --> 00:33:04,238
I said, "You hang out with Joe Louis.
How old is he?"

241
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:09,195
Frank said,
"Joe Louis is 137 years old".

242
00:33:09,413 --> 00:33:12,782
Oh, man.
You ain't never met no Frank Sinatra.

243
00:33:14,627 --> 00:33:17,996
Fuck you, fuck you and fuck you!
Who's next?

244
00:33:26,847 --> 00:33:29,173
What's that? Some kind
of weave or something?

245
00:33:29,392 --> 00:33:32,346
It's my natural hair.
I've been growing it since birth.

246
00:33:33,521 --> 00:33:35,976
What kind of chemicals
you got in there?

247
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:39,274
None, only juices and berries.

248
00:33:39,485 --> 00:33:43,530
That ain't nothing but Ultra-Perm.
How do you want it cut?

249
00:33:45,658 --> 00:33:48,410
Just make it nice and neat.

250
00:33:57,044 --> 00:33:59,915
That'll be eight dollars.

251
00:34:07,847 --> 00:34:11,844
Tell me, Semmi. Honestly...
How do I look?

252
00:34:15,354 --> 00:34:17,014
It is time to find your queen.

253
00:34:48,721 --> 00:34:51,556
I've got a secret.

254
00:34:51,766 --> 00:34:54,470
I worship the devil.

255
00:34:58,981 --> 00:35:04,224
See, that's the problem.
I can't find a man that can satisfy me.

256
00:35:04,445 --> 00:35:07,861
Some guys go an hour,
hour and a half. That's it.

257
00:35:08,074 --> 00:35:12,866
A man's got to put in overtime
for me to get off.

258
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:16,744
I'm not interested in a man
unless he drives a B.M.W.

259
00:35:16,957 --> 00:35:21,418
Well, you know, baby, I'm almost single.
My husband's on Death Row.

260
00:35:21,629 --> 00:35:27,797
This is the first date Teresa and I have
been on since the doctor separated us.

261
00:35:29,053 --> 00:35:32,504
I'm into the group thing.

262
00:35:34,308 --> 00:35:37,677
I was Joan of Arc in my former life.

263
00:35:41,774 --> 00:35:44,063
(RAPPING) My name is Peaches
And I'm the best

264
00:35:44,276 --> 00:35:47,147
All the D.J.s want
to feel my breasts

265
00:35:52,243 --> 00:35:55,826
I want to work in videos, but I want to be
my own star in the video,

266
00:35:56,038 --> 00:36:01,329
because I want to be a pop singer,
a rock singer, and write my own songs.

267
00:36:01,544 --> 00:36:06,206
And then I'm going to try an actress,
'cause people tell me I'm a natural.

268
00:36:06,424 --> 00:36:11,631
Then I'm going to write and direct
my own stories, produce the movies...

269
00:36:25,276 --> 00:36:27,849
I hope you don't mind me coming over
and sitting down.

270
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:33,444
But I've been watching you all evening,
and I want to tear you apart.

271
00:36:35,369 --> 00:36:37,991
And your friend, too.

272
00:36:41,584 --> 00:36:47,124
Does every woman in New York
have a severe emotional problem?

273
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:50,294
I doubt we will ever find your queen.

274
00:36:51,969 --> 00:36:57,176
- Mr. Clarence.
- The boys from Africa! How are you?

275
00:36:57,808 --> 00:37:03,016
- Where can one find nice women here?
- You've got to get out and look.

276
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:05,223
We've been to every bar in Queens.

277
00:37:05,441 --> 00:37:08,062
You can't go to no bar
to find a nice woman.

278
00:37:08,277 --> 00:37:13,817
You've got to go to nice places,
like the library and church.

279
00:37:14,033 --> 00:37:17,236
Or this place, where I'm going tonight.
The Black Awareness Rally.

280
00:37:17,453 --> 00:37:20,787
There's going to be
some fine women there. Clean girls.

281
00:37:28,214 --> 00:37:31,380
I didn't come here
to preach to you today.

282
00:37:36,305 --> 00:37:42,390
But when I look at these contestants
for The Miss Black Awareness pageant,

283
00:37:42,603 --> 00:37:48,309
I feel good, 'cause I know
there's a God somewhere.

284
00:37:48,526 --> 00:37:50,602
There's a God somewhere.

285
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,026
Turn around, ladies.

286
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:57,651
You know there's a God
who sits up high, and looks down low.

287
00:37:57,868 --> 00:38:00,538
Man cannot make it like this.

288
00:38:00,746 --> 00:38:04,115
Larry Flint, Hugh Hefner...
They can take the picture,

289
00:38:04,333 --> 00:38:09,838
but they can't make it.
Only God above can make it for ya.

290
00:38:10,047 --> 00:38:15,124
These are the best women Queens has
to offer. Pick one, and let's go home.

291
00:38:15,344 --> 00:38:17,136
Be patient, my friend.

292
00:38:17,346 --> 00:38:21,261
Do you love him? Do you feel joy?
Say "joy"!

293
00:38:21,475 --> 00:38:24,097
- Joy!
- Joy.

294
00:38:24,311 --> 00:38:25,971
- Joy!
- Joy!

295
00:38:26,188 --> 00:38:31,313
- Can I get a "Amen"?
- Amen, brother!

296
00:38:31,527 --> 00:38:34,362
Don't be ashamed to call his name.

297
00:38:34,572 --> 00:38:35,900
Yes, Lord!

298
00:38:36,115 --> 00:38:40,065
Only God can give that woman
that kind of joy.

299
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:45,576
- Make a joyful noise unto the Lord.
- Joy!

300
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:48,626
- I am very happy to be here.
- Amen!

301
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:54,168
Can I get a "Amen"?

302
00:38:55,551 --> 00:39:01,305
I don't know what you've come to do,
but I've come to praise His name.

303
00:39:02,767 --> 00:39:04,806
Lord, Lord...

304
00:39:07,063 --> 00:39:10,847
Girls, you can leave now.
Thank you very much.

305
00:39:11,067 --> 00:39:13,937
There's a God somewhere.

306
00:39:15,112 --> 00:39:17,983
I've got a special treat for you
this evening.

307
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:22,196
A young man that you all know
as Joe the policeman

308
00:39:22,411 --> 00:39:26,243
from the "What's Going Down"
episode of "That's My Momma".

309
00:39:26,457 --> 00:39:30,289
I want you to put your hands together
and welcome him to the stage.

310
00:39:30,503 --> 00:39:34,500
A big round of applause
for Jackson Height's own

311
00:39:34,715 --> 00:39:39,710
Mr. Randy Watson! Randy Watson.

312
00:39:39,929 --> 00:39:43,594
- That boy's good.
- Good and terrible.

313
00:39:45,267 --> 00:39:47,059
And Reverend Brown.

314
00:39:47,269 --> 00:39:51,433
He's been my reverend since
I was a little boy, and I love him dearly.

315
00:39:51,649 --> 00:39:57,236
You're a very special man.
Reverend Brown! Reverend Brown.

It feels so lovely to be here tonight.
Give yourselves a round of applause.

Give a big round of applause
to my band, Sexual Chocolate.

337

Yeah, one more time!
Randy Watson, how about it!

Before we go any further,
I'd like to thank Mr. Cleo McDowell,

340
00:41:52,311 --> 00:41:56,854
who's responsible for the fine food
and beverage here tonight.

341
00:41:57,066 --> 00:42:00,731
Cleo, I know you're proud
of your daughters. We are, too.

342
00:42:00,945 --> 00:42:04,278
Please welcome one of the organisers
of tonight's festivities.

343
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:07,740
Miss Lisa McDowell.
Lisa, come up here, baby girl.

344
00:42:08,411 --> 00:42:12,574
- Work in a plug for the new salad bar.
- I'm not mentioning the restaurant.

345
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:15,791
At least give them the address.

346
00:42:19,463 --> 00:42:24,505
Someone ought to put you on a plate
and suck you up with a biscuit.

347
00:42:28,347 --> 00:42:34,136
Black Awareness Week is
an opportunity for self-expression.

348
00:42:34,353 --> 00:42:37,188
- May we leave now?
- No, wait.

349
00:42:37,398 --> 00:42:43,353
...express himself through song.
In his own unique way, but...

350
00:42:43,571 --> 00:42:46,322
The song makes a good point.

351
00:42:46,532 --> 00:42:49,023
The children are our future,

352
00:42:49,243 --> 00:42:54,238
and it's up to all of us to provide a place
where they can express themselves.

353
00:42:55,207 --> 00:42:58,623
We need to rebuild Lincoln Park.

354
00:42:59,503 --> 00:43:05,589
Ushers are passing with donation
baskets, so please - give all you can.

355
00:43:07,011 --> 00:43:10,462
We're happy to get
the kind of money that jingles,

356
00:43:10,681 --> 00:43:13,351
but we'd rather get the kind that folds.

357
00:43:22,526 --> 00:43:25,895
- Donations. Donations!
- I thought it was the trash.

358

- Stupid ass.
- I'll whip your ass.

359
00:43:28,657 --> 00:43:34,079
- You tar-black motherfucker.
- There's women here. Calm down.

Thank you.

00:43:52,431 --> 00:43:56,014
- She is wonderful.
- Akeem...

362

You can see Lisa, and Mr. McDowell,
at McDowell's Restaurant,

363
00:44:01,649 --> 00:44:05,860
8507, Queens Boulevard.

364
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:08,691
8507, Queens Boulevard.

365
00:44:20,918 --> 00:44:24,453
Your first job every morning
will be to sweep this walkway.

366
00:44:24,672 --> 00:44:28,622
Then I want you to wash
all the windows. Real good, too.

367
00:44:28,843 --> 00:44:31,927
And don't leave no streaks.

368
00:44:35,016 --> 00:44:38,301
Hey! Hey! What are you doing?

369
00:44:39,854 --> 00:44:43,472
Get the hell out of here
before I bust that camera!

370
00:44:47,194 --> 00:44:52,437
Me and the McDonald's people,
we've got this little misunderstanding.

371
00:44:55,161 --> 00:44:59,870
See, they're "McDonald's".
I'm "McDowell's".

372
00:45:02,168 --> 00:45:06,913
They've got the golden arches.
Mine are the golden arcs.

373
00:45:09,884 --> 00:45:12,801
They've got the Big Mac.
I've got the Big Mick.

374
00:45:13,012 --> 00:45:17,508
We both got two all-beef patties, sauce,
lettuce, cheese, pickles and onions.

375
00:45:17,725 --> 00:45:23,561
But they use a sesame seed bun.
My buns have no seeds.

376
00:45:25,649 --> 00:45:28,319
I've got it.

377
00:45:31,197 --> 00:45:35,526
You've got to mop the food-prep area
twice a day.

378
00:45:35,743 --> 00:45:39,278
- Do you know how to mop?
- Yes, of course.

379
00:45:40,164 --> 00:45:42,453
There you go.

380
00:45:56,138 --> 00:46:00,302
Don't use the bucket.
It'll just confuse you.

381
00:46:00,518 --> 00:46:04,765
When you get through here,
you take out the trash.

382
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:08,812
Come with me,
I've got an easy job for you.

383
00:46:39,473 --> 00:46:43,341
- Hi!
- Hello.

384
00:46:45,688 --> 00:46:47,930
Hello.

385
00:46:48,899 --> 00:46:51,355
Hi...

386
00:46:52,486 --> 00:46:54,942
I am Akeem.

387
00:46:56,574 --> 00:46:59,694
It's nice to meet you, Akeem.

388
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:05,367
I've been placed in charge of garbage.
Do you have any that needs disposal?

389
00:47:05,583 --> 00:47:08,833
No, it's totally empty.

390
00:47:09,962 --> 00:47:14,541
When it fills up, don't be afraid
to call me. I'll take it out urgently.

391
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:18,384
That's good to know.

392
00:47:18,596 --> 00:47:22,546
When you think of garbage,
think of Akeem.

393
00:47:24,685 --> 00:47:28,350
Well, I have to get back
to my sanitation duties.

394
00:47:28,564 --> 00:47:33,641
Maybe we will have a chance
again to talk on a professional level.

395
00:47:35,237 --> 00:47:37,526
Goodbye, Akeem.

396

397
00:48:35,589 --> 00:48:39,967
Darryl! You're looking sharp.

398
00:48:40,177 --> 00:48:44,389
How about a Mick-Shake?
I believe strawberry is your favourite.

399
00:48:44,598 --> 00:48:46,258
Straw.

400
00:48:46,475 --> 00:48:51,137
Lisa's in the back.
She's waiting for you. Come on.

401
00:48:53,149 --> 00:48:56,518
- How's everything at Soul Glo?
- Fine.

402
00:48:56,736 --> 00:48:59,939
Our home weave products
are really taking off.

403
00:49:00,156 --> 00:49:05,446
Dad isn't using the tickets for the Jets
game. I thought you might enjoy them.

404
00:49:05,661 --> 00:49:09,030
That's very considerate of you.
Thank you!

405
00:49:11,542 --> 00:49:15,207
- Lisa! Look who's here, honey.
- Hi!

406
00:49:15,421 --> 00:49:18,872
You two kids have a good time,
you hear?

407
00:49:23,596 --> 00:49:25,387
- Ready?
- Sure.

408
00:49:26,474 --> 00:49:28,881
I want to ask you something.

409
00:49:29,101 --> 00:49:34,725
At the rally, someone stuck a large
amount of cash in one of the boxes.

410
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:38,309
You wouldn't happen to know
who that was, would you?

411
00:49:40,404 --> 00:49:43,856
- Well, I...
- I thought it was you!

412
00:49:44,909 --> 00:49:48,159
You know me. Anything for the kids.

413
00:49:54,668 --> 00:49:57,290
- Hi, guys.
- Hello.

414
00:50:00,591 --> 00:50:05,549
I got four tickets to the St. John's game.
Maybe your sister can bring someone.

415
00:50:05,763 --> 00:50:09,132
Take care of this, will you?

416
00:50:21,362 --> 00:50:24,565
- Excuse me.
- Hey, it's Kunta Kinte.

417
00:50:29,203 --> 00:50:31,659
What can I do you for?

418
00:50:34,709 --> 00:50:38,658
- Can you make my hair look like this?
- Why would you want that?

419
00:50:38,879 --> 00:50:41,038
I like your hair, it's natural.

420
00:50:41,257 --> 00:50:45,171
I wish more children would wear their
hair natural, like Martin Luther King.

421
00:50:45,386 --> 00:50:51,175
You ain't never seen Martin Luther King
with no messy curls on his head.

422
00:50:51,392 --> 00:50:55,721
- I met Dr. Martin Luther King once.
- You're lying, you ain't never met him.

423
00:50:55,938 --> 00:50:58,939
I met him in 1962
in Memphis, Tennessee.

424
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:01,937
I'm walking down the street
minding my own business.

425
00:51:02,153 --> 00:51:04,857
I walk round the corner,
and a man hits me in the chest.

426
00:51:05,072 --> 00:51:07,646
I fall on the ground. I look up,
and it's Martin Luther King.

427
00:51:07,867 --> 00:51:11,366
I said, "Dr. King." He said,
"Oops, I thought it was someone else."

428
00:51:11,579 --> 00:51:14,414
- You never met Martin Luther King.
- He knocked me over.

429
00:51:14,623 --> 00:51:17,031
- No, he didn't.
- Yes, he did.

430
00:51:17,251 --> 00:51:19,078
Why do you worry about how you look?

431
00:51:19,295 --> 00:51:23,589
I'm trying to gain the interest
of a certain young lady.

432
00:51:23,799 --> 00:51:27,251
I ain't heard no woman give no man
no lovin' 'cause his hair looks good.

433
00:51:27,470 --> 00:51:31,088
- That's right.
- Is this an American girl?

434
00:51:32,808 --> 00:51:36,758
You got to go through her papa. People
don't know that about American women.

435
00:51:36,979 --> 00:51:38,806
Ain't nothing to do with your hair
or your pocket.

436
00:51:39,023 --> 00:51:43,400
You get in good with American
woman's father, you in good with her.

437
00:51:43,611 --> 00:51:46,944
Get in good with the father,
you home free.

438
00:51:47,156 --> 00:51:50,276
- Home free.
- Like a bird.

439
00:52:00,628 --> 00:52:03,498
- Mr. McDowell.
- What is it?

440
00:52:04,465 --> 00:52:09,423
Sir, did you catch the professional
football contest on television last night?

441
00:52:10,888 --> 00:52:13,889
- No, I didn't.
- It was most exhilarating.

442
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:17,054
The Giants of New York
took on the Packers of Green Bay.

443
00:52:17,269 --> 00:52:22,264
The Giants triumphed by kicking
an oblong pigskin ball through a big "H".

444
00:52:22,483 --> 00:52:24,559
It was a ripping victory.

445
00:52:26,862 --> 00:52:31,109
Son, and I'm just going
to tell you this one time.

446
00:52:31,325 --> 00:52:34,492
You want to keep working here,
stay off the drugs.

447
00:52:35,955 --> 00:52:38,362
Yes, sir.

448
00:52:43,754 --> 00:52:48,250
I don't know how it is in Africa,
but here rich guys get all the chicks.

- He must work very hard.
- The Prince of Soul Glo?

450
00:52:58,436 --> 00:53:02,683
No way.
He lives off his father's invention.

451
00:53:02,898 --> 00:53:08,023
He can buy her anything he wants. How
are you going to compete with that?

452
00:53:09,321 --> 00:53:12,239
(LOUD DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

453
00:53:32,428 --> 00:53:34,467
(DOORBELL)

454
00:53:35,264 --> 00:53:37,720
I'll get it.

455
00:53:45,357 --> 00:53:48,311
- Delivery for Miss Lisa McDowell.
- I'll take it, I'm her sister.

456
00:53:48,527 --> 00:53:51,149
Would you sign here, please?

457
00:53:59,413 --> 00:54:03,245
- What is it?
- Something for you.

458
00:54:03,459 --> 00:54:06,413
Do you mind if I open it?

459
00:54:10,674 --> 00:54:13,925
- Do you think they're real?
- They couldn't be.

460
00:54:20,601 --> 00:54:23,637
- Somebody's messing around.
- I am not.

461
00:54:24,563 --> 00:54:26,770
I don't care
how much a man admires you.

462
00:54:26,982 --> 00:54:30,897
He's not giving you earrings like that
unless you've given him booty.

463
00:54:31,112 --> 00:54:36,948
- Not everybody thinks like you.
- They do, but they don't admit it.

464
00:54:54,343 --> 00:54:58,293
Do you realise I have not had sex
since we got to America?

465
00:54:58,514 --> 00:55:01,431
Semmi, look. There she is.

466
00:55:02,476 --> 00:55:04,932
- I'm going to talk to her.
- Good.

467
00:55:05,146 --> 00:55:07,719
Tell her you sent her
the $500,000 pair of earrings.

468
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:12,104
She will fall into your arms, and we
can leave this god-forsaken place.

469
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:14,146
- I cannot do that.
- Do something.

470
00:55:14,363 --> 00:55:19,072
- Do not worry, I have a plan.
- To mop your way into her heart?

471
00:55:19,285 --> 00:55:22,784
- That's not fair.
- Nor is me doing manual labour.

472
00:55:24,665 --> 00:55:27,951
- I'm badly in need of a manicure.
- Listen to you...

473
00:55:28,169 --> 00:55:31,123
"I'm badly in need of a manicure."

474
00:55:31,338 --> 00:55:34,589
Are you going to say something?

475
00:55:38,304 --> 00:55:43,013
- Akeem! This is my sister, Patrice.
- Hello, how are you?

476
00:55:43,225 --> 00:55:47,057
- Akeem's from Africa.
- What are you doing in New York?

477
00:55:47,271 --> 00:55:50,640
- I'm a student.
- What school are you going to?

478
00:55:50,858 --> 00:55:53,693
I go to the University.

479
00:55:53,903 --> 00:55:55,480
Which one?

480
00:55:57,615 --> 00:56:00,402
The University of the United States.

481
00:56:02,161 --> 00:56:04,367
I've never heard of that.

482
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:08,115
It's a very small university.
We don't even have a basketball team.

483
00:56:08,334 --> 00:56:13,755
Really? We've got an extra ticket
for the St. John's game. Want to come?

484
00:56:15,299 --> 00:56:16,841
Yes.

485
00:56:17,051 --> 00:56:20,586
You can double-date
with me and Darryl.

486
00:56:46,497 --> 00:56:48,786
In his face! In his face!

487
00:56:48,999 --> 00:56:51,751
Yes! In the face!

488
00:56:55,256 --> 00:56:58,340
Why don't you take off your jacket,
Akeem?

489
00:56:58,551 --> 00:57:02,050
"Put it in the face, " right? I like this.

490
00:57:03,097 --> 00:57:06,300
- Isn't that better?
- Yes, thank you very much.

491
00:57:14,024 --> 00:57:17,690
Wearing clothes must be
a new experience for you.

492
00:57:17,903 --> 00:57:21,948
- Are you able to follow the game?
- Oh, yes!

493
00:57:22,158 --> 00:57:25,408
I'm following the game quite well.

494
00:57:27,246 --> 00:57:31,196
What kind of games do you play
in Africa? Chase the monkey?

495
00:57:32,626 --> 00:57:35,995
No, we play football.
I believe you call it soccer.

496
00:57:36,213 --> 00:57:38,087
Yeah, right. Soccer.

497
00:57:38,299 --> 00:57:44,218
That's a real cute sport. Especially the
way you bounce the ball off your heads.

498
00:57:44,430 --> 00:57:48,380
I don't like any sport
where you don't use your hands.

499
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:51,968
Yes! Yes!

500
00:57:52,188 --> 00:57:56,102
What are you doing?
It's just the half-time.

501
00:57:57,151 --> 00:58:01,231
This is my favourite part of the game.
Will you excuse me for a moment?

502
00:58:01,447 --> 00:58:05,030
Excuse me. I'll be back in a minute.

503
00:58:19,507 --> 00:58:22,840
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, my goodness, it is you!

504
00:58:23,928 --> 00:58:26,253
I cannot believe it.

505
00:58:29,308 --> 00:58:33,222
- Greetings, your Highness.
- Please, stop bowing.

506
00:58:33,437 --> 00:58:37,601
- I am a loyal citizen of Zamunda.
- You will spill your beverages.

507
00:58:38,734 --> 00:58:41,901
This is the greatest day of my life.

508
00:58:42,822 --> 00:58:46,866
It was very nice meeting you, too.
Excuse me.

509
00:58:50,454 --> 00:58:55,116
Please! Please, may I just have
my picture taken with you?

510
00:59:06,512 --> 00:59:12,099
I will cherish this experience
for the rest of my life.

511
00:59:18,065 --> 00:59:20,936
For the rest of my life.

512
00:59:23,404 --> 00:59:27,817
- Who was that?
- Just a man I met in the restroom.

513
00:59:35,499 --> 00:59:39,829
- Why don't you quit this job?
- Because I like it here.

514
00:59:40,045 --> 00:59:43,829
But you're my lady.
My lady doesn't have to work.

515
00:59:45,176 --> 00:59:48,710
I'll take care of you.
Get you anything you want.

516
00:59:49,972 --> 00:59:52,890
- What can I get you?
- Nothing.

517
00:59:54,852 --> 00:59:57,972
I'll get you some... coffee.

518
00:59:59,356 --> 01:00:02,108
- I'll be right back.
- OK.

519
01:00:09,033 --> 01:00:12,034
Hey, Akeem. Did you have
a good time at the game?

520
01:00:12,244 --> 01:00:13,655
Yes, thank you.

521
01:00:13,871 --> 01:00:17,454
I hope Darryl didn't offend you.
He can be pretty obnoxious.

522
01:00:17,666 --> 01:00:21,581
- He cannot help it.
- Sit down, take a break for a minute.

523
01:00:21,796 --> 01:00:23,753
Thank you.

524
01:00:25,424 --> 01:00:27,880
You're an unusual guy.

525
01:00:28,094 --> 01:00:31,213
I've never seen anybody take
so much pride in mopping a floor.

526
01:00:31,430 --> 01:00:35,510
"He who would learn to fly
must first learn to stand and walk.

527
01:00:35,726 --> 01:00:40,602
"One cannot fly into flying."
That's not mine, that's Nietzsche's.

528
01:00:40,815 --> 01:00:44,647
That's what I mean. The guys
who work here don't quote Nietzsche.

529
01:00:49,782 --> 01:00:53,115
Everybody shut up and do what I say.

530
01:00:53,327 --> 01:00:57,823
Get the money out!
Stay cool, nobody gets hurt.

531
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:00,496
Take the money out! All of it.

532
01:01:00,709 --> 01:01:03,794
Don't stall me, fat boy. Let's go.

533
01:01:04,004 --> 01:01:07,587
Come on! You're wasting my time.
Come on!

534
01:01:11,053 --> 01:01:14,054
Anybody move,
I'll blow your fucking head off.

535
01:01:14,265 --> 01:01:17,515
What are you looking at, buddy?

536
01:01:19,395 --> 01:01:23,060
Come on! Stop stalling.

537
01:01:25,568 --> 01:01:29,731
Come on. Don't stall me. All of it!

538
01:01:34,827 --> 01:01:38,611
- Come on!
- Excuse me for a moment.

539
01:01:44,837 --> 01:01:46,794
It would be wise for you
to put the weapon down.

540
01:01:47,006 --> 01:01:49,212
Who is this asshole?

541
01:01:50,843 --> 01:01:55,552
Please refrain from using any more
obscenities in front of these people.

542
01:01:55,765 --> 01:01:58,434
I've warned you.
I'll be forced to thrash you.

543
01:01:58,642 --> 01:02:00,635
Fuck you!

544
01:02:05,941 --> 01:02:09,560
Freeze,
you diseased rhinoceros' pizzle.

545
01:02:21,874 --> 01:02:26,583
Hey, fellas. I'm real proud of the job
you did in there today.

546
01:02:26,796 --> 01:02:29,334
We've been hit by that guy five times,

547
01:02:29,548 --> 01:02:34,506
but I don't think he's coming back,
thanks to my African connections.

548
01:02:36,263 --> 01:02:41,850
Leave Sunday night open.
I'm having a get-together at my house.

549
01:02:43,562 --> 01:02:45,685
You see?
He has accepted us as equals.

550
01:02:48,526 --> 01:02:53,318
OK, fellas. Give them a ticket, take their
keys and park the cars down the street.

551
01:02:53,531 --> 01:02:56,366
When you're finished, come inside
and help out in the kitchen.

552
01:02:56,575 --> 01:03:02,411
Akeem, I want to show you
the inside of McDowell's little castle.

553
01:03:07,211 --> 01:03:12,371
This here is my showplace.
It pretty much speaks for itself.

554
01:03:13,634 --> 01:03:20,253
When I grew up, nine of us lived
in a shack no bigger than this room.

555
01:03:20,975 --> 01:03:24,141
And look what I have today.

556
01:03:24,353 --> 01:03:27,603
I only wish Mrs. McDowell
could have lived to see it.

557
01:03:27,815 --> 01:03:31,647
- You have a fine house, sir.
- Thank you.

558
01:03:31,861 --> 01:03:37,365
In 20 or 30 years, with hard work,
maybe you could have a place like this.

559
01:03:40,953 --> 01:03:43,526
- That would be something.
- Wouldn't it?

560
01:03:47,501 --> 01:03:51,119
This is where you're going
to be working tonight.

561
01:03:59,722 --> 01:04:04,514
- Ever open a champagne bottle?
- I have seen it done before.

562
01:04:04,727 --> 01:04:07,514
Make sure you keep all the glasses full.

563
01:04:07,730 --> 01:04:12,143
I'd better get dressed. Make yourself
comfortable 'til the guests arrive.

564
01:04:15,321 --> 01:04:20,991
I love the Lord. Do you understand
what I'm saying? I love the Lord.

565
01:04:21,202 --> 01:04:25,151
And if loving the Lord is wrong,
I don't want to be right.

566
01:04:25,372 --> 01:04:30,959
Hi, Mike. Good to see you. Enjoy, drink
up. Lots more where that came from.

567
01:04:31,212 --> 01:04:35,375
Hey, Randy! Good to see you.
Watch out for this guy.

568
01:04:35,591 --> 01:04:37,382
Big Ed, my man!

569
01:04:38,427 --> 01:04:42,840
You know, I can appreciate the way
you handled that dude with the gun.

570
01:04:43,474 --> 01:04:46,344
I would've helped you out, except...

571
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:49,597
I had a cup of coffee in my hand.
You understand, right?

572
01:04:49,814 --> 01:04:55,519
I bet you learnt all that stuff
fighting lions and tigers and shit.

573
01:04:55,736 --> 01:04:59,354
Yes, where I'm from,
we have to be very aggressive.

574
01:04:59,573 --> 01:05:03,238
I'm all for that. Especially with women.

575
01:05:04,036 --> 01:05:06,823
They may not admit it,

576
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:11,785
but they all want
a man to take charge.

577
01:05:16,507 --> 01:05:19,591
Tell them what to do.

578
01:05:27,435 --> 01:05:29,641
That's one of the things
I want to talk to you...

579
01:05:29,854 --> 01:05:34,350
Darryl, your mother gets lovelier
every time I see her.

580
01:05:34,567 --> 01:05:39,525
- Cleo, I'd like to talk to you alone.
- Sure. Excuse us.

581
01:05:39,738 --> 01:05:43,024
- Mum, Dad, Grandma...
- Sure, son.

582
01:05:43,242 --> 01:05:47,571
I like the fries better at McDonald's,
but I'd never tell Mr. McDowell that.

583
01:05:49,707 --> 01:05:52,708
Make sure everybody's glass
is kept full.

584
01:05:52,918 --> 01:05:56,667
We're about to make
a very special announcement.

585
01:06:01,218 --> 01:06:04,504
May I have
everyone's attention, please.

586
01:06:08,225 --> 01:06:13,564
Mr. and Mrs. Jenks, would you join me?
Mother Jenks, you come up here, too.

587
01:06:22,990 --> 01:06:26,441
I've just heard some news
that makes me a very happy man.

588
01:06:26,660 --> 01:06:28,203
Semmi, please...

589
01:06:30,748 --> 01:06:33,073
Champagne.

590
01:06:34,251 --> 01:06:37,169
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

591
01:06:37,379 --> 01:06:40,831
Okay, get going. Get out of here. Go on.

592
01:06:42,968 --> 01:06:48,722
As you know, Darryl and Lisa have been
going together for quite some time.

593
01:06:48,933 --> 01:06:54,093
I'm pleased to announce
that Darryl just popped the big question.

594
01:06:56,357 --> 01:06:59,642
And Lisa happily accepted.

595
01:07:06,951 --> 01:07:10,569
So as it turns out, this has become
an engagement party.

596
01:07:11,372 --> 01:07:14,955
Amen! Praise the Lord.

597
01:07:15,167 --> 01:07:19,331
- Married?
- To the bride and groom.

598
01:07:19,547 --> 01:07:21,539
To the bride and groom!

599
01:07:21,757 --> 01:07:23,880
To the bride and groom.

600
01:07:31,392 --> 01:07:35,555
I want you and that young man
to tie that knot. I'll pray for you.

601
01:07:35,771 --> 01:07:38,725
And I want you to hold on
to God's unchanging hand.

602
01:07:38,941 --> 01:07:42,606
'Cause he helped Joshua
fight the battle of Jericho.

603
01:07:43,863 --> 01:07:46,733
And he helped Daniel
get out of the lion's den.

604
01:07:46,949 --> 01:07:51,113
He helped Gilligan get off the island.
Lord!

605
01:07:51,328 --> 01:07:54,365
I want to talk to you, now!

606
01:08:04,467 --> 01:08:09,508
The next time you and my father
plan my life, let me in on it.

607
01:08:09,722 --> 01:08:12,094
- It's not like...
- Don't touch me!

608
01:08:12,308 --> 01:08:15,593
But, baby, it's our engagement party.

609
01:08:26,822 --> 01:08:28,779
Thanks.

610
01:08:35,956 --> 01:08:41,496
- Would you like some champagne?
- No, I don't feel like celebrating.

611
01:08:44,006 --> 01:08:48,585
Wait. Sit down and keep me company.

612
01:08:57,478 --> 01:09:01,143
If you're going to hang out with me,
you've got to loosen up.

613
01:09:01,357 --> 01:09:04,192
I can be loose. See?

614
01:09:05,528 --> 01:09:07,520
Much better.

615
01:09:09,198 --> 01:09:12,152
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

616
01:09:12,368 --> 01:09:17,196
But I won't be pressured into marriage,
not by Darryl, my father or anybody.

617
01:09:18,165 --> 01:09:21,700
I understand.
In my country they arrange marriages,

618
01:09:21,919 --> 01:09:24,624
but no one should marry
out of obligation.

619
01:09:24,839 --> 01:09:30,462
You're right. How could I even have
considered marrying a guy like Darryl?

620
01:09:30,678 --> 01:09:36,301
- I wondered the same thing.
- He made me so furious back there.

621
01:09:36,517 --> 01:09:41,512
- Do you think I overreacted?
- The first reaction is often correct.

622
01:09:43,190 --> 01:09:47,686
You're very easy to talk to.
I feel like I could tell you anything.

623
01:09:53,451 --> 01:09:58,112
Hey, Akeem. We need
some more champagne over here.

624
01:09:59,915 --> 01:10:03,119
I almost forgot that I was here
in a domestic capacity.

625
01:10:03,335 --> 01:10:07,713
Thanks for listening to me, Akeem.
I really appreciate it.

626
01:10:07,923 --> 01:10:11,090
Any time, Lisa McDowell.

627
01:10:15,931 --> 01:10:18,505
Hey! Be careful.

628
01:10:19,769 --> 01:10:23,102
I think my sister likes you.

629
01:10:30,446 --> 01:10:32,438
Semmi!

630
01:10:35,075 --> 01:10:37,115
Semmi.

631
01:10:41,832 --> 01:10:48,167
- Come, you're going to be late for work.
- So what if I am?

632
01:10:48,380 --> 01:10:53,173
We cannot anger Mr. McDowell.
Things are going so well with Lisa.

633
01:10:53,385 --> 01:10:57,253
I do not care.
I'm not going to work today.

634
01:10:57,515 --> 01:11:00,599
Yes, you are going to work today.

635
01:11:01,644 --> 01:11:04,182
I'm sick of living like a peasant.
Look at this filth.

636
01:11:04,396 --> 01:11:08,857
Do you want to live better? Fine.
Fix this place up.

637
01:11:09,068 --> 01:11:11,737
But you are going to work today!

638
01:11:21,622 --> 01:11:23,780
- Hello!
- Hi!

639
01:11:23,999 --> 01:11:27,700
I started on clean-up just like you guys,
but now...

640
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:33,080
See, I'm washing lettuce.
Soon, I'll be on fries. Then the grill.

641
01:11:33,926 --> 01:11:36,962
In a year or two,
I'll make assistant manager

642
01:11:37,179 --> 01:11:40,465
and that's where the big bucks
start rolling in.

643
01:11:40,683 --> 01:11:43,518
Just two years, huh?

644
01:11:47,231 --> 01:11:52,605
Maybe I've stayed with him
because everyone expected me to.

645
01:11:52,820 --> 01:11:56,734
- You must be tired of my problems.
- No, not at all.

646
01:11:58,033 --> 01:12:00,785
I feel like I owe you a favour.

647
01:12:00,995 --> 01:12:05,906
Come to my house and I'll fix
you dinner. Patrice will be there.

648
01:12:06,125 --> 01:12:10,502
Let's go to my house.
I'd like to cook for you.

649
01:12:10,713 --> 01:12:14,331
- You cook?
- I dabble a little, yes.

650
01:12:14,550 --> 01:12:17,467
Great! Tell you what,
I'll buy the groceries.

651
01:12:17,678 --> 01:12:23,017
Fine. But I have to warn you.
My home is very poor.

652
01:12:23,225 --> 01:12:27,519
I don't care about that.
I'd love to see where you live.

653
01:12:41,076 --> 01:12:44,077
Welcome to my humble abode.

654
01:12:49,668 --> 01:12:50,997
Akeem!

655
01:12:52,797 --> 01:12:56,581
- What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong.

656
01:12:56,801 --> 01:13:01,094
Everything's fine.
Excuse me for a moment, please.

657
01:13:05,351 --> 01:13:08,969
- What have you done?
- You told me to fix up the place.

658
01:13:10,940 --> 01:13:14,807
I should kill you!
I'm supposed to be a poor man.

659
01:13:15,027 --> 01:13:18,028
<i>Akeem? Akeem.</i>

660
01:13:20,866 --> 01:13:23,073
- Is everything all right?
- Everything is fine.

661
01:13:23,285 --> 01:13:26,037
Excuse me, I have to tidy up.

662
01:13:42,221 --> 01:13:44,890
What are you doing?

663
01:13:47,017 --> 01:13:50,600
For God's sake,
do not take my pocket money.

664
01:13:55,276 --> 01:13:58,442
If you have no more money,
you can cause no more mischief.

665
01:13:58,654 --> 01:14:01,406
You are being unreasonable.

666
01:14:01,615 --> 01:14:07,535
If you have ruined my chances
with Lisa, I will never forgive you.

667
01:14:10,875 --> 01:14:13,366
- I'm very sorry.
- Can we go in now?

668
01:14:13,586 --> 01:14:16,622
- No, we cannot.
- Why not?

669
01:14:16,839 --> 01:14:20,255
There's a big rat inside.

670
01:14:20,468 --> 01:14:23,172
I think there is no rat.

671
01:14:23,387 --> 01:14:28,844
You're so ashamed of your apartment
you can't even let me see it.

672
01:14:29,059 --> 01:14:32,393
Once again, you have judged correctly.

673
01:14:32,605 --> 01:14:37,397
- If it bothers you, we can go out to eat.
- That would be much better.

674
01:15:03,219 --> 01:15:05,888
Excuse me for a moment, please.

675
01:15:15,439 --> 01:15:20,185
- What did you give him?
- I just gave him some pocket change.

676
01:15:34,875 --> 01:15:38,078
- Randolph...
- Leave me alone, Mortimer.

677
01:15:38,295 --> 01:15:41,249
Randolph! Randolph!

678
01:15:42,967 --> 01:15:47,011
- I'm still not talking to you.
- Look!

679
01:15:53,978 --> 01:15:57,347
Mortimer, we're back.

680
01:15:57,565 --> 01:16:00,269
Yeah!

681
01:16:00,985 --> 01:16:03,357
To America!

682
01:16:07,533 --> 01:16:09,656
Why did you come here?

683
01:16:09,869 --> 01:16:13,368
- To find something special.
- It's a long way to travel.

684
01:16:13,581 --> 01:16:18,326
No journey is too great,
when one finds what he seeks.

685
01:16:18,544 --> 01:16:22,957
- Does everyone in Africa talk like you?
- Why, do you not like it?

686
01:16:23,174 --> 01:16:28,879
I love it. It's nice to be with a man
who knows how to express himself.

687
01:16:29,930 --> 01:16:31,840
- Thank you!
- Thank you very much!

688
01:16:32,057 --> 01:16:34,465
Let's have lunch.

689
01:16:37,813 --> 01:16:41,147
You have the most amazing effect
on people.

690
01:16:41,358 --> 01:16:46,317
- No, I don't.
- Take the guy at the basketball game.

691
01:16:46,530 --> 01:16:49,152
People love you.

692
01:16:50,117 --> 01:16:54,779
I bet where you're from,
women throw themselves at your feet.

693
01:16:54,997 --> 01:17:00,502
- Why do you say that?
- You have an inner glow.

694
01:17:00,711 --> 01:17:04,839
You're above anything petty.
It's almost regal.

695
01:17:08,844 --> 01:17:15,511
- What did you do back home?
- I was... in the family business.

696
01:17:16,393 --> 01:17:20,261
- What's that?
- Goat herding.

697
01:17:21,273 --> 01:17:24,358
Yes, yes. Does it surprise you?

698
01:17:24,568 --> 01:17:27,735
No, it's just that you seem so educated.

699
01:17:27,947 --> 01:17:33,107
The life of a goat herder is easy,
the goats take care of themselves.

700
01:17:33,327 --> 01:17:37,455
Which leaves a man
with a great deal of time to read.

701
01:17:40,292 --> 01:17:43,993
- Please, let me.
- No, I should pay.

702
01:17:44,213 --> 01:17:47,796
Akeem, I wish you'd stop
worrying about being poor.

748
01:21:52,086 --> 01:21:55,122
If you're the prince, then who am I?

749
01:21:58,175 --> 01:22:00,666
My servant.

750
01:22:12,940 --> 01:22:16,985
They smell good. Darryl must be
spending a fortune on flowers.

751
01:22:17,194 --> 01:22:19,864
Stay out of this, Dad.

752
01:22:20,072 --> 01:22:23,940
- Where are you going?
- To a museum. With Akeem.

753
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:28,288
- I don't like that one bit.
- What's wrong with Akeem?

754
01:22:29,373 --> 01:22:32,327
You told me yourself.
He's a goat herder.

755
01:22:33,627 --> 01:22:38,622
Why don't you marry Darryl?
He dresses nice, he treats you good.

756
01:22:38,841 --> 01:22:42,210
You only like Darryl because he's rich.

757
01:22:43,554 --> 01:22:47,848
I don't want you to have to struggle
like your mother and I did.

758
01:22:48,058 --> 01:22:51,474
I know. Bye, Daddy.

759
01:22:51,729 --> 01:22:53,768
Bye...

760
01:22:55,649 --> 01:22:58,271
(KNOCKAT DOOR)

761
01:22:58,486 --> 01:23:00,692
Come in.

762
01:23:02,948 --> 01:23:07,741
- You boys wanted to see me.
- We would like to change apartments.

763
01:23:09,497 --> 01:23:12,284
Goddamn! What the hell
have you done in here?

764
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:17,043
My friend Semmi has altered the
apartment, so we would like to change.

765
01:23:17,254 --> 01:23:18,914
This stuff ain't hot, is it?

766
01:23:19,131 --> 01:23:25,216
No, but I'm bringing a young lady up,
and she can't see me living like this.

767
01:23:26,847 --> 01:23:32,932
I'll let you boys stay in my apartment
and I'll move up here.

768
01:23:33,145 --> 01:23:38,484
- Does your apartment look poor?
- It's a real shithole. You'll love it.

769
01:23:39,777 --> 01:23:45,364
Here are the keys. It's apartment 1 A.
Downstairs. First floor.

770
01:23:45,574 --> 01:23:49,406
Thank you, you're too kind.
Semmi, move our things.

771
01:23:57,461 --> 01:24:00,747
I have a date with Lisa.
Isn't that wonderful?

772
01:25:19,627 --> 01:25:21,833
Who in the hell is that?

773
01:25:33,182 --> 01:25:39,303
What's up, brother? You're a little late
for the Christmas pageant.

774
01:25:43,275 --> 01:25:46,193
I'm King Jaffe Joffer, ruler of Zamunda.

775
01:25:46,403 --> 01:25:50,532
Have a seat. Chair number two
will be ready in a second.

776
01:25:53,869 --> 01:25:56,740
This is beautiful. What is that - velvet?

777
01:25:58,916 --> 01:26:01,122
I have come for my son Akeem.

778
01:26:01,335 --> 01:26:06,163
- Who?
- You know, Kunta.

779
01:26:06,382 --> 01:26:12,586
- The boy upstairs.
- He live upstairs on the fifth floor.

780
01:26:15,015 --> 01:26:18,100
Who's going to clean up the flowers?

781
01:26:27,528 --> 01:26:30,149
You may enter.

782
01:26:36,954 --> 01:26:40,821
- You are not Akeem.
- I know that.

783
01:26:49,383 --> 01:26:52,752
- What is this?
- A photograph.

784
01:26:52,970 --> 01:26:55,046
What is this "McDowell's"?

785
01:26:55,264 --> 01:27:00,424
It's a place over on Queens Boulevard.
I think he works there.

786
01:27:00,644 --> 01:27:03,562
My son works?!

787
01:27:03,772 --> 01:27:09,359
- Where is he now?
- He moved to apartment 1 A.

788
01:27:20,581 --> 01:27:23,997
Your Majesty.
What are you doing here?

789
01:27:24,210 --> 01:27:27,294
I received your telegram.
Where is Akeem?

790
01:27:28,714 --> 01:27:32,581
He went out. How was your flight?
Comfortable, I trust.

791
01:27:32,801 --> 01:27:37,760
Your job was to look after Akeem.
How could you let this happen?

792
01:27:37,973 --> 01:27:41,592
Akeem will not listen to me,
he's gone quite mad.

793
01:27:43,229 --> 01:27:45,055
Semmi...

794
01:27:45,272 --> 01:27:50,018
You've disgraced yourself,
and you must be punished.

795
01:27:50,986 --> 01:27:56,147
You will confine yourself to our
royal suite at the Waldorf-Astoria.

796
01:27:56,367 --> 01:28:01,492
See that he puts on some decent attire.
And bathe him thoroughly.

797
01:28:07,294 --> 01:28:09,702
Thank you, your Majesty!

798
01:28:11,841 --> 01:28:15,969
Look, Zamunda!
That's where you're from, isn't it?

799
01:28:16,178 --> 01:28:19,843
- What's it like?
- It's the most beautiful place on earth.

800
01:28:20,057 --> 01:28:26,345
The people are very friendly, and you...
You, they would treat like a queen.

801
01:28:31,986 --> 01:28:34,821
People will see us.

802
01:28:35,447 --> 01:28:38,152
Then let them see. Lisa...

803
01:28:38,367 --> 01:28:40,443
- Let us go.
- Now?

804
01:28:40,661 --> 01:28:43,496
Yes. Right now.

805
01:28:59,513 --> 01:29:05,302
Darryl, come by the house tonight.
About 9 o'clock.

806
01:29:06,187 --> 01:29:08,808
Lisa will be home by then.

807
01:29:09,023 --> 01:29:12,308
Don't worry about it,
we'll work something out.

808
01:29:12,526 --> 01:29:15,100
Okay, see you later.

809
01:29:20,534 --> 01:29:25,196
Mr. McDowell...
There's some people here to see you.

810
01:29:26,999 --> 01:29:30,333
- Are they from McDonald's?
- I don't think so.

811
01:29:37,384 --> 01:29:40,006
What can I do for you?

812
01:29:43,057 --> 01:29:45,630
This is King Jaffe Joffer,
ruler of Zamunda.

813
01:29:45,851 --> 01:29:50,145
- He's searching for his son Akeem.
- Your son?

814
01:29:50,356 --> 01:29:54,400
- Yes, my son, the Prince.
- Prince? Are you serious?

815
01:29:54,610 --> 01:29:57,445
Prince Akeem is the sole heir
to the throne of Zamunda.

816
01:29:57,655 --> 01:30:00,774
I knew there was something special
about that boy.

817
01:30:00,991 --> 01:30:05,986
- Can you tell us where he might be?
- He's out with my lovely daughter Lisa.

818
01:30:08,541 --> 01:30:11,910
I'm staying at the Waldorf-Astoria.
When you see him, call me.

819
01:30:12,127 --> 01:30:14,369
- I'll tell him you're here.
- No.

820
01:30:14,588 --> 01:30:19,297
Do not alert him to my presence.
I shall deal with him myself.

821
01:30:25,182 --> 01:30:30,177
- For your trouble.
- Thank you, your Royalness.

822
01:30:40,698 --> 01:30:42,240
A prince!

823
01:31:04,597 --> 01:31:07,384
Wait! We cannot go in.

824
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:09,509
Why not?

825
01:31:09,727 --> 01:31:12,811
Wait in the car. I will be right back.

826
01:31:22,948 --> 01:31:25,274
- We must leave.
- I don't care about the apartment.

827
01:31:25,493 --> 01:31:28,197
It's not that. I feel like I'm rushing you.

828
01:31:28,412 --> 01:31:30,488
No, you're not.

829
01:31:31,373 --> 01:31:35,039
- It's better if we take our time.
- But I want to.

830
01:31:35,252 --> 01:31:38,170
It's better if I take you home.

831
01:31:44,553 --> 01:31:49,381
Look who's here!
Akeem, it's good to see you.

832
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:52,517
- It's good to see you, too.
- Have a drink.

833
01:31:52,728 --> 01:31:57,307
- I have to get going, Mr. McDowell.
- You have time for one drink.

834
01:31:57,525 --> 01:31:59,185
Get out of here, dog.

835
01:31:59,401 --> 01:32:01,643
We don't spend enough time talking.

836
01:32:01,862 --> 01:32:04,436
Perhaps some other time,
I have to get going.

837
01:32:04,657 --> 01:32:08,191
Sit down,
I'll be right back with that drink.

838
01:32:25,719 --> 01:32:28,637
King Jaffe Joffer's room, please.

839
01:32:30,808 --> 01:32:33,725
Hello, King. Cleo McDowell here.

840
01:32:33,936 --> 01:32:37,103
Both the kids are here, together.

841
01:32:37,314 --> 01:32:43,068
2432 Derby Avenue,
Jamaica Estates. Right.

842
01:32:43,279 --> 01:32:46,979
King, I was wondering if... Hello, King?

843
01:32:50,619 --> 01:32:53,905
- I really have to go, sir.
- No. Have a seat right here.

844
01:32:54,123 --> 01:32:55,617
Did you want ice?

845
01:32:55,833 --> 01:32:59,249
(DOORBELL)
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

846
01:33:10,848 --> 01:33:13,968
- Who was that?
- Jehovah's Witness.

847
01:33:14,185 --> 01:33:17,139
(DOORBELL)
Excuse me.

848
01:33:23,402 --> 01:33:27,234
She doesn't like you anymore.
Get that through your greasy head!

849
01:33:27,448 --> 01:33:30,117
But you told me to come over.

850
01:33:32,828 --> 01:33:34,785
Now, where were we?

851
01:33:50,304 --> 01:33:53,009
I warned you, didn't I? Dottie, get him!

852
01:34:02,900 --> 01:34:05,817
I appreciate your hospitality,
but I have to get going.

853
01:34:06,028 --> 01:34:07,985
You can stay a little while longer.

854
01:34:08,197 --> 01:34:12,195
I just put some delicious hors d'oeuvres
in the oven... son.

855
01:34:13,285 --> 01:34:15,527
Let me go see if they're ready.

856
01:34:19,083 --> 01:34:22,119
- Lisa, I must leave.
- Is something wrong, Akeem?

857
01:34:23,212 --> 01:34:25,785
I'll tell you when the time is right,
but now I must go.

858
01:34:26,006 --> 01:34:29,007
Tell your father goodbye for me.

859
01:34:32,555 --> 01:34:34,843
- Where's Akeem?
- He had to leave.

860
01:34:35,057 --> 01:34:38,971
- He can't leave!
- What is going on?

861
01:34:39,186 --> 01:34:42,686
And why are you so nice to Akeem
all of a sudden?

862
01:34:42,898 --> 01:34:45,389
I like the boy.

863
01:34:45,609 --> 01:34:48,812
- What are you up to?
- What? Nothing.

864
01:34:49,029 --> 01:34:51,485
A man's got a right
to change his mind.

865
01:34:51,699 --> 01:34:56,028
- Daddy...
- You two make a beautiful couple.

866
01:34:56,245 --> 01:34:59,863
- Daddy...
- He's a real fine young man.

867
01:35:00,082 --> 01:35:06,203
- Dad!
- Okay, Lisa. He's rich. He is rich!

868
01:35:06,422 --> 01:35:09,043
- What?
- He's got his own money.

869
01:35:09,258 --> 01:35:15,047
When I tell you he's got his own money,
I mean the boy has got his own money.

870
01:35:22,438 --> 01:35:25,604
A prince. He's a prince!

871
01:35:28,110 --> 01:35:31,444
Lisa, you did it this time.
You hit the jackpot!

872
01:35:31,655 --> 01:35:35,487
Your goat herder makes Darryl
look like a welfare case.

873
01:35:49,215 --> 01:35:51,670
I will get out here.

874
01:35:52,760 --> 01:35:55,926
That'll be nine bucks.

875
01:36:15,824 --> 01:36:17,069
Semmi...

876
01:36:17,952 --> 01:36:21,036
Good news, Akeem.
We've been rescued.

877
01:36:21,247 --> 01:36:26,205
- Where are my parents?
- They've gone to the McDowell's.

878
01:36:26,418 --> 01:36:28,541
- Come with me.
- Where are we going?

879
01:36:28,754 --> 01:36:30,663
Back to Queens.

880
01:36:32,049 --> 01:36:35,500
Look who's here! Come in, come in.

881
01:36:35,719 --> 01:36:38,507
Welcome to Casa de McDowell's.
Come right in.

882
01:36:48,524 --> 01:36:51,394
- Where is Akeem?
- He just stepped out.

883
01:36:51,610 --> 01:36:55,690
Probably went for a pizza.
You know these youngsters.

884
01:36:55,906 --> 01:36:59,607
This must be your lovely wife.
How are you today?

885
01:36:59,827 --> 01:37:01,784
Very well, thank you.

886
01:37:01,996 --> 01:37:06,788
I don't know whether to shake
your hand, kiss it or bow or what.

887
01:37:07,001 --> 01:37:10,204
I feel like break dancing.

888
01:37:10,421 --> 01:37:16,257
Come in, have a seat, take a load off.
Your son ought to be back in a minute.

889
01:37:16,468 --> 01:37:20,169
- Try the Lazy-Boy. It's comfortable.
- It's very nice.

890
01:37:20,389 --> 01:37:22,180
Put your feet up.

891
01:37:29,857 --> 01:37:32,562
Here you go, King.
Try one of these pigs in a blanket.

892
01:37:32,776 --> 01:37:34,983
They're the frozen kind,
but you'd never know it.

893
01:37:35,196 --> 01:37:38,031
You told me my son was here.

894
01:37:38,240 --> 01:37:42,867
My daughter Lisa might know where
he went. They've gotten quite close.

895
01:37:43,078 --> 01:37:46,032
Where is your daughter?
I must speak to her at once.

896
01:37:46,624 --> 01:37:49,459
Lisa?
There's someone here to see you.

897
01:37:55,674 --> 01:37:59,090
This is Akeem's father. The King!

898
01:37:59,303 --> 01:38:01,343
Leave us.

899
01:38:10,397 --> 01:38:14,063
- I understand you're seeing my son.
- I was seeing him.

900
01:38:14,276 --> 01:38:16,316
So you know about his wife
in Zamunda?

901
01:38:16,529 --> 01:38:18,984
- He's married?
- No, but he will be soon.

902
01:38:19,198 --> 01:38:23,112
We've already chosen his bride.
So you see...

903
01:38:23,327 --> 01:38:25,865
he cannot be serious about you.

904
01:38:26,080 --> 01:38:30,374
Akeem came to America to...
sow his royal oats.

905
01:38:31,836 --> 01:38:34,243
Excuse me, I need to be alone.

906
01:38:34,463 --> 01:38:38,792
Are you comfortable, Miss...
I'm not sure what to call you.

907
01:38:39,009 --> 01:38:44,170
- My name is Cleo.
- Nice to meet you. My name's Aoleon.

908
01:38:44,390 --> 01:38:47,059
Aoleon. Aeolon...

909
01:38:50,563 --> 01:38:55,901
Lisa, where are you going?
I want you to meet the Queen.

910
01:38:56,110 --> 01:39:02,113
- Are you all right, my dear?
- I'm sorry. I have to get out of here.

911
01:39:02,324 --> 01:39:04,946
What's the matter, baby?

912
01:39:10,165 --> 01:39:12,324
What did you say to my daughter?

913
01:39:12,543 --> 01:39:16,243
The truth. That Akeem
could not be interested in her.

914
01:39:16,463 --> 01:39:21,422
- How can you be so sure?
- Our son can't consort with such a girl.

915
01:39:21,635 --> 01:39:24,126
Now, wait a minute!

916
01:39:25,347 --> 01:39:26,758
Oha...

917
01:39:30,102 --> 01:39:34,182
You have been inconvenienced,
and I'm prepared to compensate you.

918
01:39:34,398 --> 01:39:37,648
- Shall we say 1 million dollars?
- No way.

919
01:39:37,860 --> 01:39:41,311
- 2 million.
- You can't buy my daughter off.

920
01:39:41,530 --> 01:39:45,065
- Nonsense!
- Jaffe, apologise to Mr. McDowell.

921
01:39:45,284 --> 01:39:48,819
I will not. The man is beneath me,
and so is his daughter.

922
01:39:49,038 --> 01:39:52,454
I don't give a damn who you are.
This is America, Jack.

923
01:39:52,666 --> 01:39:57,743
You say one more word about Lisa,
and I'll break my foot off in your ass.

924
01:39:59,131 --> 01:40:02,832
- Pardon me?
- What's everybody yelling about?

925
01:40:03,052 --> 01:40:07,096
Their son, the Prince, loves your sister,
but the King can't handle it.

926
01:40:07,306 --> 01:40:10,722
No, he's not.
The Prince is in love with me.

927
01:40:16,148 --> 01:40:19,315
- Are you all right?
- Yes, Mother. I'm fine.

928
01:40:19,527 --> 01:40:22,527
Why are you hugging him?
He's just the servant.

929
01:40:23,864 --> 01:40:27,198
He's the Prince.

930
01:40:28,619 --> 01:40:31,157
Who told you that?

931
01:40:37,503 --> 01:40:41,547
- You mean Akeem's the Prince?
- Yeah, and he's in love with Lisa.

932
01:40:41,757 --> 01:40:44,924
How come she always gets
the good ones?

933
01:40:47,805 --> 01:40:51,637
- Where is Lisa?
- Your daddy ran her off.

934
01:40:55,688 --> 01:40:58,689
- What did you tell her?
- It is of no consequence.

935
01:40:58,899 --> 01:41:03,360
- We shall return to Zamunda at once.
- I will not leave without Lisa.

936
01:41:03,571 --> 01:41:06,441
So you do care for her?

937
01:41:08,117 --> 01:41:11,071
Mother, I love her.

938
01:41:11,287 --> 01:41:13,908
Then go after her.

939
01:41:18,544 --> 01:41:23,538
- Akeem! I forbid you.
- Put a sock in it, Jaffe. The boy's in love.

(KNOCKING AT WINDOW)

941
01:41:49,992 --> 01:41:52,448
Darryl, what happened?

942
01:41:54,330 --> 01:41:58,956
- Lisa dumped me.
- I know. You poor thing.

943
01:42:01,003 --> 01:42:06,424
The first thing we have to do
is get you out of these wet clothes.

944
01:42:08,802 --> 01:42:10,760
Stop!

945
01:42:10,971 --> 01:42:12,928
Lisa!

946
01:42:13,140 --> 01:42:14,682
Lisa!

947
01:42:19,980 --> 01:42:22,222
I will be fine by myself.

948
01:43:13,075 --> 01:43:15,281
Lisa, please.

949
01:43:16,203 --> 01:43:19,288
I did not mean to hurt you.

950
01:43:19,498 --> 01:43:23,330
Well, at least I know
who gave me these.

951
01:43:23,544 --> 01:43:27,079
You can keep them,
'cause I don't want them...

952
01:43:27,298 --> 01:43:29,919
...and I don't want you.

953
01:43:44,023 --> 01:43:46,430
Lisa! Lisa...

954
01:43:46,692 --> 01:43:48,270
Just leave me alone!

955
01:43:48,485 --> 01:43:51,652
Lisa, please. I love you.

956
01:43:51,864 --> 01:43:54,189
What about the woman
you are supposed to marry?

957
01:43:54,408 --> 01:43:57,326
I don't love her.
Why do you think I came here?

958
01:43:57,536 --> 01:44:00,573
Your father told me -
to sow your royal oats.

959
01:44:00,789 --> 01:44:06,329
I came to America to find my bride.
I came to Queens to find you.

960
01:44:06,545 --> 01:44:10,709
So why did you lie to me? Why didn't
you just tell me you were a prince?

961
01:44:10,925 --> 01:44:14,376
I wanted you to love me for who I am.

962
01:44:14,595 --> 01:44:18,509
- I'm not sure who are.
- I'm the man you fell in love with.

963
01:44:18,724 --> 01:44:21,559
Should it matter that I am a prince?

964
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:25,808
It shouldn't, but I...

965
01:44:26,023 --> 01:44:31,480
Say you never loved me,
and I won't bother you again.

966
01:44:38,661 --> 01:44:41,946
It just wouldn't work out,
we're too different.

967
01:44:42,164 --> 01:44:44,620
You're royalty, for God's sake.

968
01:44:44,833 --> 01:44:46,791
Do you want me
to renounce my throne? I will.

969
01:44:47,002 --> 01:44:51,332
I renounce my throne. I am no longer
the Prince of Zamunda.

970
01:44:51,549 --> 01:44:53,790
I renounce my throne!

971
01:44:58,264 --> 01:45:01,134
Does this make you happy?

972
01:45:09,984 --> 01:45:13,400
I can't let you do that.

973
01:45:13,612 --> 01:45:16,483
I do not care about my crown.

974
01:45:16,699 --> 01:45:19,700
All I care about is you.

975
01:45:19,910 --> 01:45:22,532
Marry me, Lisa.

976
01:45:27,084 --> 01:45:32,624
- So, what do you think?
- Go on, honey. Take a chance.

977
01:45:45,644 --> 01:45:50,686
Look, I'm sorry. I can't.
Goodbye, Akeem.

978
01:45:58,073 --> 01:46:01,739
If you're really a prince, I'll marry you.

979
01:47:18,612 --> 01:47:23,654
Look at it this way. At least we learned
how to make French fries.

980
01:47:50,102 --> 01:47:53,056
You're still not speaking to me.

981
01:47:54,106 --> 01:47:57,475
- I only want our son to be happy.
- And so do I.

982
01:47:57,693 --> 01:48:01,144
Aoleon, please. It is out of our hands.
The girl told him no.

983
01:48:01,363 --> 01:48:04,613
After the way you treated her,
who could blame her?

984
01:48:04,825 --> 01:48:09,119
Even if she said yes, they still couldn't
marry. It's against the tradition.

985
01:48:09,330 --> 01:48:11,951
Well, it is a stupid tradition.

986
01:48:12,708 --> 01:48:17,002
- Who am I to change it?
- I thought you were the King.

Your Highness. Your Highness!

Would you really
have given this up for me?

991
01:50:28,344 --> 01:50:31,843
Of course. If you like,
we can give it all up now.

A man goes into a restaurant.
Are you listening?

996

A man goes into a restaurant.
He sits down and has a bowl of soup.

997
01:51:59,101 --> 01:52:01,806
He says to the waiter,
"Come, taste the soup".

998

The waiter says, "Is there something
wrong with the soup?" "Taste the soup."

999

"Is the soup too hot?"
"Will you taste the soup?"

"Is the soup too cold?"
"Will you just taste the soup!"

"All right, I'll taste the soup.
Where's the spoon?"
