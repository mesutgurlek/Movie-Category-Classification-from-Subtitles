1
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:41,199
Emily?

2
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:42,131
Emily!

3
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:45,432
Come, little children

4
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:49,702
I'll take thee away

5
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:52,835
- Into a land
- Emily!

6
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:57,576
Of enchantment

7
00:01:57,717 --> 00:02:00,948
Come, little children

8
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:05,217
- The time's come to say
- Elijah! Elijah!

9
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:08,260
- Hast thou seen my sister Emily?
- Nay.

10
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:11,192
But look. They conjure.

11
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,231
Oh, God. The woods!

12
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:23,935
Emily!

13
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:27,771
- She's done for.
- Not yet!

14
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:31,112
You wake my father.
Summon the elders. Go!

15
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:38,519
Emily!

16
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:15,483
Come, child.

17
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,785
- Ahh.
- Oh, yes.

18
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,324
- Emily.
- Huh?

19
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:05,372
Oh, look.
Another glorious morning.

20
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:09,174
It makes me sick!

21
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:11,648
- Sisters!
- Yes, Winnie.
- We're coming, Winnie.

22
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,049
Right away. Sorry.

23
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:16,485
Must've been an imp.

24
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:21,185
My darling.
My little book.

25
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:25,196
We must continue with our spell now that
our little guest of honor has arrived.

26
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:28,699
Wake up. Wake up, darling.

27
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:34,171
Yes. Oh, come along, darling.
There you are.

28
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,742
- Mary!
- Right here, Winnie, right here.

29
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:39,538
- Sorry.
- Hello. Hello.

30
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:43,742
- I've noticed sister Sarah isn't helping.
- I lured the child here.

31
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:47,284
Leave her be.
She hath done her chore.

32
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,217
- You're right, I'm wrong.
- Mmm.

33
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:51,790
All right.

34
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:53,721
'Tis time!

35
00:04:55,995 --> 00:05:01,297
There it is: '' Bring to a full rolling
bubble. Add two drops oil of boil.''

36
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:03,800
Ah-ah-ah. I got it. It's heavy.
You do that, I'll do this.

37
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:14,938
'' Mix blood of owl
with the herb that's red.

38
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:18,244
Turn three times,
pluck a hair from my head.

39
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:21,912
Add a dash of pox
and a dead man's toe.''

40
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:26,082
- Dead man's toe, and make it a fleshy one.
- Dead man's toe!

41
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:29,093
Deadman's toe
Add a deadman's toe

42
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:31,595
Deadman's toe
Deadman's t--

43
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:34,098
Dead, dead, dead, dead
Dead, dead, dead, dead

44
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,599
D-- Ooh!

45
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:40,598
- Uh-oh. Deadman's toe
- Fresh one.

46
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:44,501
- Deadman, deadman
- Deadman's toe, add a--

47
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:52,008
Will you two stop that!
I need to concentrate!

48
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:54,346
Sorry, uh--

49
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:56,955
She needs to concentrate.

50
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:08,796
''Green newt saliva.''

51
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:13,463
- I-I smell a child.
- Ehh, what dost thou call that?

52
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:15,632
- A child.
- Hmph!

53
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:18,836
Sisters, gather 'round.

54
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:21,811
- One thing more, and all is done.
- Yes?

55
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:24,883
Add a bit of thine own tongue.

56
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:31,853
Oh, Winnie, thou art divine.

57
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:34,721
'Tis ready for tasting.

58
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:39,525
One drop of this
and her life will be mine.

59
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:42,065
- I mean, ours.
- Yeah.

60
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:48,400
All right, girl.

61
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,907
Open up your mouth.

62
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:54,171
- No!
- A boy!

63
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:58,080
- Get him, you fools!
- I got him. I knew I smelled a boy!

64
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:00,685
I got him. Come on. Come on.

65
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:02,186
- Get away!
- Here you go.

66
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:04,188
- Get away from my potion!
- Ohh!

67
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:09,926
Ohh!

68
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:13,865
- Winnie!
- My potion!

69
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:15,899
Emily!

70
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:22,373
Hmm. Hmm.

71
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:34,412
Winnie. Winnie.

72
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:37,546
- Look.
- Ahh!

73
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:40,421
Sisters, prepare thyselves.

74
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,961
'Tis her life force.
The potion works!

75
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:47,759
Take my hands.
We will share her.

76
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,562
Oh, Winnie,
how generous of thee.

77
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:12,649
Sisters, behold!

78
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:18,162
I am beautiful!
Boys will love me!

79
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,656
We’re young!

80
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:25,662
Well, younger.

81
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,670
But it's a start!

82
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:30,973
Sisters!

83
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:34,810
Winifred, thou art
a mere sprig of a girl.

84
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:37,415
Liar! But I shall be
a sprig forever,

85
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:42,011
once I suck the life out of
all the children in Salem!

86
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:44,782
Let's brew another batch!

87
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:49,021
You hag! There are not enough
children in the world to make
thee young and beautiful!

88
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:51,959
- Hag.
- Uh-oh.

89
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:56,160
Sisters, did you hear
what he called you?

90
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:58,133
Whatever shall we do with him?

91
00:08:58,237 --> 00:09:01,001
Let's barbecue and fillet him.

92
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,940
- Hang him on a hook
and let me play with him?
- No!

93
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:08,844
Book, darling, come to Mommy.

94
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:12,712
Yes. His punishment
must be more fulsome,

95
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:14,877
more lingering.

96
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:18,548
Dazzle me, my darling.

97
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:21,660
Let's see: amnesia, bunions,
chilblains, cholera.

98
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:24,389
- We can do better than that, I think.
- Yes.

99
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,464
Let's see what we have. Oh!

100
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:30,127
Ahh. Perfect.

101
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,670
As usual.

102
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:37,038
- His punishment shall not be to die,
- No?

103
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:41,135
but to live forever
with his guilt.

104
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:44,978
- As what, Winnie, as what?
- As what, Winnie, as what?
- Jump back!

105
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,518
Twist the bones
and bend the back.

106
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,679
Itch-it-a-cop-it-a,
Mel-a-ka-mys-tic-a.

107
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,916
Trim him of his baby fat.

108
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,185
Itch-it-a-cop-it-a,
Mel-a-ka-mys-tic-a.

109
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:56,523
Give him fur,
black as black.

110
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:59,097
- Just...
- Like...
- This.

111
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:19,512
- Open!
- Witches!

112
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,610
Daughters of darkness!
Open this door!

113
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:24,245
- Hide the child!
- The child!
- Come on!

114
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:28,417
Witches? Uh, there be
no witches here, sir!

115
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:31,428
Don't get your knickers
in a twist!

116
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:34,556
We are just three kindly
old spinster ladies!

117
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:37,568
Uh, spending a quiet
evening at home!

118
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,070
Sucking the lives
out of little children!

119
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,900
- Winifred Sanderson?
- Yes?

120
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,410
I will ask thee one final time.

121
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:49,413
- Yes?
- What hast thou done
with my son Thackery?

122
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:51,745
- Thackery. Mmm.
- Answer me!

123
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:54,547
- Well, I don't know.
- Speak!

124
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,622
Cat's got my tongue.

125
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,495
This is-- This is
terribly uncomfortable.

126
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:08,657
Sisters, sing.

127
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:15,804
Thrice I with mercury purify
and spit upon the 12 tables

128
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:19,274
- Don't listen! Cover your ears!
- Listen to them not!

129
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:26,280
Ah! Fools! All of you!

130
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:28,478
My ungodly book speaks to you.

131
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:30,953
On All Hallows Eve
when the moon is round,

132
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:35,016
a virgin will summon us
from under the ground.

133
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:37,959
Ohh! Ohhh! We shall be back!

134
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:41,363
And the lives of all
the children shall be mine!

135
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:06,224
Away!

136
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:08,485
Away, beast!

137
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:13,963
Poor Thackery Binx.

138
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:17,695
Neither his father, his mother,
nor anyone else...

139
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:20,169
ever knew what became of him...

140
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:23,730
those 3OO years ago.

141
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:27,972
And so the Sanderson Sisters...

142
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:32,039
were hanged
by the Salem town folk.

143
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:35,676
Now, there are those who say
that on Halloween night...

144
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:41,385
a black cat still guards
the old Sanderson house,

145
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:45,861
warning off any who
might make the witches...

146
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:48,525
come back to life!

147
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,899
Gimme a break.

148
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,840
Aha. We seem to have
a sceptic in our midst.

149
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,037
Mr. Dennison,
would you care to share...

150
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:04,583
your California, laid-back,
tie-dyed point of view?

151
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,113
Okay.

152
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:10,245
Granted that, uh,
you guys here in Salem...

153
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:13,449
are all into these, uh, black
cats and witches and stuff.

154
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:15,890
- Stuff?
- Fine.

155
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:19,556
But everyone here knows that Halloween
was invented by the candy companies.

156
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:22,190
- Ohh!
- It's a conspiracy.

157
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,861
It just so happens that
Halloween is based...

158
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,871
on the ancient feast
called All Hallows Eve.

159
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:31,602
It's the one night of they ear
where the spirits of the dead
can return to Earth.

160
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,407
Well said, Allison.

161
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:45,450
Well, in case Jimi Hendrix shows
up tonight, here's my number.

162
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:53,331
Come on, let's go.

163
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:54,762
- Hey, wait up.
- Did he call you?

164
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:56,767
- Yeah.
- Well, what did he say?

165
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:59,429
Max. Fat chance.

166
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:24,692
- Allison.
- Hi.

167
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:29,494
Hi. Look, um, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to embarrass you in class.

168
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:31,830
You didn't.

169
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:34,838
- My name is Max Dennison.
- Yeah, I know.
You just moved here, huh?

170
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:37,966
- Yeah, last week.
- Must be a big change for you.

171
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:40,136
Yeah, that's for sure.

172
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:44,649
- You don't like it here?
- Oh, the leaves are great, but--

173
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:48,481
- I-I don't know.
just all this Halloween stuff.
- You don't believe in it?

174
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:51,988
What, do you mean, like,
the Sanderson Sisters? No way.

175
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:55,219
- Not even on Halloween?
- Especially not on Halloween.

176
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:59,659
Trick or treat.

177
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:13,174
- Hey, Christie, wait for me.
- No, I don't think so.
- I'm coming!

178
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:50,507
Halt! Who are you?

179
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,880
Max. I just moved here.

180
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:55,920
- From where?
- Los Angeles.

181
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,388
- L.A.?
- Ohh!

182
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:04,951
- Dude!
- Tubular.

183
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:07,292
I'm Jay. This is Ernie.

184
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:12,203
How many times I gotta tell you,
my name ain't Ernie no more.

185
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:15,068
- It's Ice.
- Oh.
- Ice.

186
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:21,276
This is Ice.

187
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:28,074
So, let's have a butt.

188
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:29,984
Ah, no, thanks. I don't smoke.

189
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:32,488
They're very health conscious
in Los Angeles.

190
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:38,595
You got any cash...

191
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:42,125
Hollywood?

192
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:44,929
- No.
- Gee.

193
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:49,838
We don't get any smokes from
you, we don't get any cash.

194
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:52,910
What am I supposed to do
with my afternoon?

195
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,810
Maybe you could learn to
breathe through your nose.

196
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,285
Whoa!

197
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:03,981
Check out
the new cross-trainers.

198
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:06,819
Cool. Let me try 'em on.

199
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:10,160
Ah-ah.

200
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:16,129
- Later, dude!
- See ya, Hollywood!

201
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,953
- Hey, Max! Hey, how was school?
- It sucked!

202
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,818
Hey, hey, hey,
watch your language.

203
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:43,827
I can't believe
you made me move here!

204
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:52,335
Huh. He wasn't wearing
any shoes.

205
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:56,573
Well, must be
some form of protest.

206
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:12,587
Hey, guys.

207
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:31,534
Oh, Allison.

208
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:34,373
You're so soft.
I just wanna--

209
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:37,381
- Boo!
- Dani!

210
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:44,281
I scared you, I scared you!
Ha ha ha-ha ha!

211
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:48,553
I'm Allison. Allison.
Kiss me. I'm Allison!

212
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,924
Mom and Dad told you
to stay out of my room!

213
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:53,224
Don't be such a crab!

214
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:56,893
Guess what. You're gonna
take me trick-or-treating.

215
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:59,971
- Not this year, Dani.
- Mom said you have to.

216
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:03,404
- Well, she can take you.
- She and Dad are going to
a party at Town Hall.

217
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:05,477
Well, you're eight!
Go by yourself.

218
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:15,915
No way! This is my first time!
I'll get lost!

219
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:19,582
Besides, it's a full moon
outside! The weirdos are out!

220
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:28,760
Come on, Max. Couldn't you
forget about being a cool
teenager just for one night?

221
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:31,062
Please? Come on.

222
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:35,436
We used to have so much fun together
trick-or-treating. Remember?

223
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,839
It'll be like old times.

224
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:40,774
No. The old days are dead.

225
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:44,440
It doesn't matter what you say.
You're taking me!

226
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,450
Wanna bet?

227
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:57,923
Mom!

228
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:04,130
Let's go. Hurry up!
The bewitching hour is about to begin!

229
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:06,136
Wow-- Aah! Please help me!
Aah!

230
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:09,469
-Isn't that a scary witch?
-Stop! You look very scary. Wow!

231
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:14,840
What about you, Max?
What are you supposed to be?

232
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,107
- A rap singer.
- Oh.

233
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,116
Well, your hat should be
on sideways, shouldn't it?

234
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,152
- Say '' Halloween''!
- Halloween!
- Halloween!

235
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:27,723
- Trick or treat!
- Trick or treat!

236
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:37,399
- Lighten up, Max.
- Can we go home now?

237
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:39,401
No.

238
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:50,573
Let’s just go this way.

239
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:51,683
Dani.

240
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,553
Ding-ding. Ding-ding.

241
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:58,918
- Stop and pay the toll, kid.
- Ten chocolate bars. No licor ice.

242
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:03,357
- Dump out your sack.
- Drop dead. Moron.

243
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:05,692
- Whoa!
- Ooh!

244
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:08,027
Yo, twerp.

245
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:11,034
- How'd you like to be hung
off that telephone pole?
- Yeah!

246
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:16,199
I’d just like to see you try,
because it just so happens
I've got my big brother with me.

247
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:18,037
- Oooh!
- Max!

248
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,374
- Hollywood!
- Oh, no!

249
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:33,957
So, you're doing
a little trick-or-treating.

250
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:35,957
- Ding-dong.
- Whoo!

251
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,790
- I'm just taking
my little sister around.
- Mmm.

252
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:42,797
That's nice.

253
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:46,426
- Whoa! I love the costume!
- Yeah!

254
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:50,063
But what are you supposed to be?
A New Kid On The Block?

255
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:54,602
For your information,
he's a Little Leaguer.

256
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:56,907
- Whoa!
- Ooh, tough guy!
- I'm a Little Leaguer!

257
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:58,414
Whoa!

258
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:02,219
Yeah!

259
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:06,257
- Wait a minute.
Everybody pays the toll.
- Stuff it, zitface.

260
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,087
- Why, you little--
- Hey!

261
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:11,424
Ice, here. Pig out.

262
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,589
Come on, Dani, let's go.

263
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,257
jerk.

264
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:17,961
And Hollywood,
the shoes fit great!

265
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:21,836
Yeah!

266
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:23,964
- Trick or treat!
- You should've punched him.

267
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:26,475
He would've killed me.

268
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:29,637
- At least you would've died like a man.
- Hey!

269
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:36,248
You just humiliated me in front
of half the guys at school!

270
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:39,324
So collect your candy
and get out of my life!

271
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,653
I wanna go home now!

272
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:47,322
- Trick or treat!
- Trick or treat!
- Hi. Hi. Ooh, there's plenty--

273
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,709
Dani, I'm sorry.

274
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:03,371
Trick or treat!

275
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:06,313
It's just that
I hate this place.

276
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:08,613
I miss all my friends.

277
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,688
I wanna go home!

278
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:14,223
Well, this is your home now,
so get used to it.

279
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:17,985
Yeah.

280
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:21,623
Trick or treat!

281
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,634
- Give me one more chance?
- Why should I?

282
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,638
Because I'm your brother.

283
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:39,015
Whoa. Check that out.

284
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:42,018
What?

285
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,350
Something just few
across the moon.

286
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,864
- Fooled ya.
- Let's go,jerkface.

287
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:55,523
- Trick or treat!
- Trick or treat!

288
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:57,534
- Wow!
- Wow!

289
00:23:57,636 --> 00:23:59,604
Check out this house!

290
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:02,172
Ehh. Rich people.

291
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:05,107
They'd probably make us
drink cider and bob for apples.

292
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:08,041
- My accountant suggested penny stocks.
- Yeah.

293
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:13,951
- Trick or treat!
- Trick or treat!

294
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:19,117
-Jackpot!
- Ahh.

295
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:20,724
Whoa!

296
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:25,055
Max Dennison.

297
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:26,391
Allison!

298
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:29,956
Ohh. Allison, hmm?

299
00:24:30,101 --> 00:24:32,797
I thought you weren't
into Halloween.

300
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:36,237
I'm not. I'm, I'm just taking
my little sister Dani around.

301
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:38,104
That's nice.

302
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:41,576
- I always do it.
- My parents made him.

303
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,910
Do you guys want some cider?

304
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:45,744
- No.
- Sure.

305
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:52,748
- Ah, yes.
- Oh, I had my eye on that.

306
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:58,126
Thanks.

307
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,566
So, um, how's the party?

308
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:07,797
Boring. It'sjust a bunch of my parents'
friends. They do this every year.

309
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:13,439
I've got candy duty.

310
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:16,844
- By the way, Dani, I love your costume.
- Thank you.

311
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:18,813
I really like yours too.

312
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:22,613
Of course, I couldn't wear anything
like that because I don't have any--

313
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:25,281
What do you call 'em, Max?
Yabos?

314
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,619
Max likes your yabos.

315
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:32,288
In fact, he loves 'em.

316
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:38,598
- I'm really into witches.
- Really? Me too.

317
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:41,001
We just learned about
those sisters in school.

318
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:43,130
Oh, you mean
the Sanderson Sisters?

319
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:45,607
I know all about them.
My mom used to run the museum.

320
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,769
There's a museum about 'em?

321
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:52,782
Yeah, but they shut it down because, um,
a lot of spooky things happened there.

322
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:55,819
Well, wh-why don't we go to
this old Sanderson house?

323
00:25:58,423 --> 00:26:00,823
Well, come on,
make a believer out of me.

324
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:05,328
Okay, let me get changed.
They'll never miss me.

325
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:13,237
Max, I'm not going up there.

326
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:17,171
My friends at school told me all
about that place. It's weird!

327
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:19,675
Dani, this is the girl
of my dreams.

328
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:23,179
- So? Take her to the movies
like a normal person.
- Dani!

329
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:28,011
Look,just--just do
this one thing for me,

330
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:30,019
and I'll do anything you say.

331
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:32,214
Please?

332
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:35,019
- Please? Please?
- Oh-- Okay. Okay.

333
00:26:35,126 --> 00:26:38,926
Next year we go trick-or-treating
as Wendy and Peter Pan.

334
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:40,929
With tights, or it's no deal.

335
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,903
Okay, okay. Deal. Deal. Fine.

336
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:53,773
Legend has it that the bones
of a hundred children were
buried within these walls.

337
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:55,777
Oh, great.

338
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:12,223
Ecch.

339
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:27,076
- I can't see a thing.
- Ooh.

340
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:32,648
Well, there's a light switch
around here somewhere.

341
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:48,431
Found a lighter.

342
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,575
Whoa!

343
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:06,847
Here's the original cauldron.

344
00:28:06,985 --> 00:28:09,453
And upstairs
is where they slept.

345
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:18,287
Oh, and be careful where you
step. The foors are old.

346
00:28:21,966 --> 00:28:25,299
''This is the spell book
of Winifred Sanderson.

347
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:28,702
It was given to her
by the devil himself.

348
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,705
The book is bound
in human skin...

349
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:35,279
and contains the recipes for her
most powerful and evil spells.''

350
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,280
I get the picture.

351
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,377
What's that?

352
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:44,386
Oh. It's the black fame candle.

353
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:56,795
Hmm. Black fame candle.

354
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:59,369
'' Made from the fat of a hangman.

355
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:02,667
Legend says that on a full moon it
will raise the spirits of the dead...

356
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:05,174
when lit by a virgin
on Halloween night.''

357
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:10,747
Hmm.

358
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:14,511
So let's light the sucker
and meet the old broads.

359
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:17,520
- Will you do the honors?
- No, thanks.

360
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:18,520
Well--

361
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,861
- Stupid cat!
- Okay, Max, you've had your fun.

362
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:30,696
It's time to go.
Come on, Allison.

363
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:33,362
Max, she's right. Let's go.

364
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:36,702
Oh, come on. It's just
a bunch of hocus pocus.

365
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:40,767
Max, I'm not kidding this time.
It's time to go!

366
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:42,777
Max, no!

367
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:48,118
Uh-oh.

368
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:29,487
What happened?

369
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:32,425
A virgin... lit the candle.

370
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:55,781
We are home!

371
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:57,946
Oh, sweet revenge!

372
00:30:58,056 --> 00:31:01,492
Do you see, sisters?
My curse worked perfectly!

373
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:03,321
That's because thou art perfect.

374
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:13,467
I knew I left this cauldron on.
Didn't I tell you? Oh, I knew it.

375
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:17,974
My lucky rat tail!
just where I left it!

376
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:25,112
But who lit
the black fame candle? Hmm.

377
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:33,319
Wake up. Wake up, sleepyhead.

378
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:36,882
Oh, I've missed you.
Did you miss me too?

379
00:31:38,763 --> 00:31:40,355
Come on, now,
we've got work to do.

380
00:31:40,498 --> 00:31:41,965
- Winnie.
- Yes?

381
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:44,660
I smell children.

382
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:48,002
Sic 'em!

383
00:31:49,774 --> 00:31:52,504
- It's a little girl.
- Mmm!

384
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:55,408
Seven. Maybe eight.
And a half.

385
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:57,810
Ooh, let us play with her!

386
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:01,147
Come, little children

387
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:04,881
I'll take thee away

388
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:10,325
- In--
- Come out, my dear.
We will not harm thee.

389
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:12,692
We love children!

390
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:16,862
I thought thou would
never come, sisters.

391
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:18,936
Greetings, little one.

392
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:21,937
- 'Twas I who brought you back.
- Imagine.

393
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:26,934
Such a pretty little...

394
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:28,739
child.

395
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,247
Look at her. And she's
so well fed, isn't she?

396
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:35,113
Plump. Plump!

397
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:36,584
Shis-ka-baby.

398
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:42,256
Tell me, dumpling,
what is the year?

399
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:44,588
1 993.

400
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:49,428
Sisters, we have been gone
3OO years.

401
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:52,058
Well, Winnie,
how time fies, huh?

402
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,067
When you're dead!

403
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:07,442
It's been great fun, but I--
I guess I'd better be going.

404
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:09,450
Oh, stay for supper.

405
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:13,548
I'm-- I'm-- I'm not hungry.

406
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,922
Oh, but we are.

407
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:21,262
- Soup!
- Hey!

408
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:23,926
- Let go of my little sister.
- Roast him, Winnie.

409
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:26,765
No, let me.
Let me play with him.

410
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:40,851
You. There.

411
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:45,353
I haven't lost my touch,
sisters. See?

412
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:47,185
- Winnie, Winnie--
- Max!

413
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:51,790
- Hello. Good-bye.
- Hello, hello.

414
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:56,198
Max!

415
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,038
- Mary!
- Well, hello--

416
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:05,508
- Oh, my, my, my, my, my.
- Don't!

417
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:09,340
Okay!

418
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,711
- You leave my brother alone!
- Ohh!

419
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,879
- Max!
- I'll get you!

420
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:22,149
- Get him! Get this ani--
Get this beast off me!
- Max, come on. Let's go!

421
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:26,563
Get out! Go, go, go!

422
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:30,364
Get it off. Ahh-ha-ha-ha-ha!

423
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:36,640
- Hey!
- Hmm?

424
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:40,676
You've messed with the
great and powerful Max...

425
00:34:40,778 --> 00:34:43,008
and now must suffer
the consequences.

426
00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:45,514
I summon the burning rain
of death.

427
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:48,210
- Burning what?
- Burning rain of death.
- Burning rain of death.

428
00:34:49,954 --> 00:34:52,013
He makes fire in his hand.

429
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:58,220
Ohh! Ohh! The burning
rain of death! Ohh! Ohh!

430
00:34:58,362 --> 00:35:00,694
Come on, you idiots!
Get under shelter!

431
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:03,198
Come on, you fools!

432
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:10,365
Nice going, Max!

433
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:12,705
- It's all your fault!
- You can talk.

434
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:17,076
- Yeah, no kidding.
Now, get the spell book.
- You idiots!

435
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:20,048
Come on, move it!

436
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:22,881
N-N-No, it's not!
It's the burning rain of death!

437
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:29,255
Sic 'em! Aah! My book!

438
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:35,925
Don't! He's going for my book!
Ohhh!

439
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:38,058
- My book!
- He's got the book!
- The book!

440
00:35:39,403 --> 00:35:41,064
Max! Max, over here!

441
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:43,140
- Come on! Come on!
- This way!

442
00:35:45,843 --> 00:35:47,936
Ohh! Confound it!

443
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:52,578
- Winnie!
- We are dead!
- Shut up!

444
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:55,481
- It is but water!
- Huh?

445
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,315
- Most refreshing.
- Ahh. It is.

446
00:35:57,455 --> 00:36:00,049
- You idiot!
- Ahhh!
- The boy has tricked us!

447
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,626
- And he's stolen the book!
- Ahhh!
- After him!
- Ohh!

448
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:16,133
- 'Tis a b-black river.
- Perhaps it is not too deep.

449
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:24,842
- 'Tis firm!
- Careful, Winnie.
- Hmm. Mmm.

450
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:27,610
- 'Tis firm as stone.
- Why-- Why, it's a road!

451
00:36:27,718 --> 00:36:29,310
- Firm asstone
- Sisters!
- Firm asstone

452
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:31,318
My book!

453
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:51,533
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Come on! This is a graveyard!

454
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:55,840
It's hallowed ground.
Witches can't set foot here.

455
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,811
- He talks.
- Oh.

456
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:01,484
Follow me!

457
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:11,885
Over here.
I want to show you something.

458
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:14,896
Give you an idea of exactly
what we're dealing with.

459
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,841
''William Butcherson,
lost soul''?

460
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:27,172
Billy Butcherson
was Winifred's lover,

461
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:29,712
but she found him sporting
with her sister Sarah,

462
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:33,339
so she poisoned him and sewed
his mouth shut with a dull needle...

463
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:36,249
so he couldn't tell her
secrets even in death.

464
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:39,151
- Winifred always was the jealous type.
- You're Thackery Binx.

465
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,885
- Yes.
- Huh. So the legends are true.

466
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:44,995
Well, come along. I want
to show you something else.

467
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:52,828
Teenagers again.
I hate Halloween.

468
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,269
Man, this is the worst night of
the year. You wanna give me a hand?

469
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:57,874
- Who-- Who-- Who-- Who are they?
- Boys?

470
00:37:57,975 --> 00:37:59,704
Witch hunters. Observe.

471
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:04,372
They wear black robes and carry
axes to chop the wood to burn us.

472
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:06,541
- Hold me.
- What a pretty spider.

473
00:38:08,252 --> 00:38:12,086
Sisters! Let me make
one thing perfectly clear.

474
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:15,249
The magic
that brought us back...

475
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:18,226
only works tonight,
on All Hallows Eve.

476
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:21,594
When the sun comes up,
we are dust.

477
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:22,960
- Dust?
- Toast!

478
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,863
Toast?

479
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:27,233
- Pudding!
- Aaah!

480
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:30,739
Fortunately the potion I brewed
the night we were hanged...

481
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:33,571
will keep us alive
and young forever.

482
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:37,444
Unfortunately the recipe for
that potion is in my spell book,

483
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:39,105
and the little wretches
have stolen it!

484
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:42,583
Therefore, it stands to reason,
does it not, sisters dear,

485
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:45,155
that we must find the book,
brew the potion...

486
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:49,055
and suck the lives out of the children
of Salem before sunrise.

487
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:54,291
Otherwise, it's curtains!
We evaporate! We cease to exist!

488
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:56,957
Dost thou comprehend?

489
00:38:57,101 --> 00:38:58,625
You explained it
beautifully, Winnie.

490
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:00,760
The way you sort of started out
with the adventure part...

491
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:02,998
- and then you sort of slowly--
- Explained what?

492
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:07,611
- Come! We fy!
- Fly!

493
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:11,011
Because of me my little
sister's life was stolen.

494
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:15,676
For years I waited for my life to end
so I could be reunited with my family.

495
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:20,120
But Winifred's curse
of immortality kept me alive.

496
00:39:20,224 --> 00:39:22,954
Then one day I figured out
what to do with my eternal life.

497
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:26,826
Now, I'd failed Emily,
but I wouldn't fail again.

498
00:39:26,964 --> 00:39:31,264
When Winifred and her sisters returned,
I'd be there to stop them.

499
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:35,203
So for three centuries I've guarded
the house on All Hallows Night,

500
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:38,467
when I knew some airhead virgin
might light that candle.

501
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:42,137
- Nice going, airhead.
- Hey, look, I'm sorry, okay?

502
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:47,484
We're talking about three ancient hags
versus the 2Oth century.

503
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:50,850
- How bad can it be?
- Bad.

504
00:39:50,988 --> 00:39:53,388
- Stay out of there!
- Why?

505
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:56,982
It holds Winifred's most dangerous
spells. She must not get it.

506
00:39:57,094 --> 00:39:58,994
Well, let's torch the sucker.

507
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:09,204
It's protected by magic.

508
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:20,173
It's just a bunch
of hocus pocus!

509
00:40:20,284 --> 00:40:22,184
- Sarah!
- Mmm?

510
00:40:22,286 --> 00:40:24,550
Mary.

511
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:28,419
- Max!
- Brave little virgin
who lit the candle.

512
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:31,892
- I'll be thy friend.
- Hey, take a hike!

513
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:33,860
Ooh! Ouch!

514
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:39,364
- Book!
- Huh?

515
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:42,098
- Come to Mommy!
- 'Fraid not!

516
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:45,367
Thackery Binx,
thou mangy feline!

517
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:47,706
- Still alive?
- And waiting for you!

518
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:50,212
Ohh! Thou hast waited
in vain!

519
00:40:50,314 --> 00:40:52,407
And thou will fail
to save thy friends,

520
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,916
just as thou failed
to save thy sister!

521
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:58,555
Grab the book!

522
00:41:12,736 --> 00:41:16,103
- They can't touch us here, right?
- Well, they can't.

523
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,302
I don't like the way
you said that.

524
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:21,934
Unfaithful lover
long since dead,

525
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,377
deep asleep in thy wormy bed,

526
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:27,246
wiggle thy toes,
open thine eyes,

527
00:41:27,351 --> 00:41:30,411
twist thy fingers
toward the sky.

528
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:33,081
Life is sweet.
Be not too shy.

529
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:37,126
On thy feet, so sayeth I!

530
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:48,802
Max! Max!

531
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:02,149
Huh?

532
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:15,623
Hi. Hello, Billy.

533
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:19,495
Catch those children!
Get up!

534
00:42:19,637 --> 00:42:22,800
Get up! Get out of that ditch!
Faster!

535
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:34,214
In here!

536
00:42:46,196 --> 00:42:47,561
Yes!

537
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:02,137
- Are you okay?
- Mm-hmm.

538
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:05,147
- What is this place, Binx?
- It's the old Salem crypt.
- Here, take the book.

539
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:10,016
- It connects to the sewer
and up to the street.
- Oh. Uh, charming.

540
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:15,684
- Uh, don't look up, Dani.
- Don't worry. I won't.

541
00:43:15,793 --> 00:43:18,921
Relax. I've hunted mice
down here for years.

542
00:43:19,063 --> 00:43:22,362
- Mice?
- Oh, God.
- Oh, God. Just great.

543
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:27,704
Oh, cheese and crust!
He's lost his head!

544
00:43:27,805 --> 00:43:30,774
Ha! Damn that Thackery Binx!
Damn him!

545
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:34,071
Billy, which way did they go?
Aaah!

546
00:43:34,211 --> 00:43:36,236
Billy, listen to me.

547
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:40,248
Follow those children,
you maggot museum, and get my book!

548
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:44,377
Then come find us!
We'll be ready for them!

549
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:47,924
Quit staring at me!
Get moving down that hole!

550
00:43:48,058 --> 00:43:49,889
- Damn, damn, double damn!
- Oh!

551
00:43:49,994 --> 00:43:51,723
Broom, ho!

552
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:55,429
This way!

553
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:02,739
- Broom, ho.
- Ahh.

554
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:06,872
They're here.
I know they're here.

555
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:09,741
- I know they're here,
but where are they?
- Winnie, look.

556
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:13,578
- Sniff them out, Mary.
- Uh, they're, they're, uh--

557
00:44:13,684 --> 00:44:15,652
- Oh, I can't. They've gone too far.
- Aah!

558
00:44:15,786 --> 00:44:18,084
- I've lost them!
- Aaah!
- Aah!

559
00:44:18,188 --> 00:44:22,249
I'll have your guts for garters, girl!
Confound you!

560
00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:25,226
Very well.
We must outwit them.

561
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,422
- When Billy the butcher
gets here with my book,
- Book!

562
00:44:27,531 --> 00:44:28,998
- we shall be ready for them!
- Ready!

563
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:31,124
- Sarah!
- Sarah!

564
00:44:31,268 --> 00:44:34,135
- Let us start collecting children.
- Why?

565
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:38,774
Because, you great buffoon,
we want to live forever,

566
00:44:38,876 --> 00:44:40,503
not just until tomorrow.

567
00:44:40,644 --> 00:44:43,670
The more children's lives we snatch,
the longer we shall live!

568
00:44:43,814 --> 00:44:47,011
- Right! Let us fy!
- Fly!
- Wait!

569
00:44:47,151 --> 00:44:50,814
Sisters. I have an idea.

570
00:44:50,954 --> 00:44:55,288
Since this promises to be a most
dire and stressful evening,

571
00:44:55,392 --> 00:44:58,122
I suggest we form
a calming circle.

572
00:44:58,228 --> 00:45:00,992
- I am calm!
- Oh, sister.

573
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:06,159
Thou art not being honest
with thyself, are we? Huh? Huh?

574
00:45:06,303 --> 00:45:08,669
Come on. Come on.
Give me a smile.

575
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:22,010
Come along. Not much further.

576
00:45:22,152 --> 00:45:25,383
Let's see. Which way, which way.
I can't remember. Oh! Look, down here!

577
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:27,714
Think soothing thoughts.

578
00:45:27,858 --> 00:45:28,984
- Rabid bats.
- Yum!

579
00:45:29,093 --> 00:45:32,654
Black death.
Mummy's scorpion pie.

580
00:45:32,763 --> 00:45:34,663
- Mother.
- Mother.
- Mother.

581
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:45,841
Bubble, bubble, I'm in trouble.

582
00:45:45,943 --> 00:45:48,377
Tell me, friend,
what is this contraption?

583
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:51,379
I call it... a bus.

584
00:45:51,515 --> 00:45:53,574
- A bus.
- A bus?

585
00:45:53,717 --> 00:45:57,050
- And its purpose?
- To convey gorgeous creatures
such as yourselves...

586
00:45:57,187 --> 00:46:00,679
to your most forbidden desires.

587
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:04,350
Well, fancy,

588
00:46:04,461 --> 00:46:06,361
we desire...

589
00:46:07,131 --> 00:46:09,190
children.

590
00:46:09,299 --> 00:46:12,359
Hey, that may take me a couple of tries,
but I don't think that'd be a problem.

591
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:14,528
- Oh.
- Hop on up.
- Marvellous!

592
00:46:14,638 --> 00:46:16,037
Thank you.

593
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:19,732
Thank you.

594
00:46:19,877 --> 00:46:22,072
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm!

595
00:46:22,212 --> 00:46:27,411
I need one of those instant ice packs.
You girls are giving me a fever! Yeow!

596
00:46:30,154 --> 00:46:33,055
- Go, Binx!
- Come here, you guys! This way!

597
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:43,592
Hurry! Come on!

598
00:46:43,734 --> 00:46:45,599
Up the ladder!

599
00:46:47,271 --> 00:46:50,240
- Come on!
- Careful.

600
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:55,403
Hey, buttercup, anybody ever tell you
you're very easy on the eyes?

601
00:47:01,618 --> 00:47:04,052
Binx! Look out!

602
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:05,587
Whoa! Speed bump!

603
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:10,787
- Binx! Ohh!
- Speed bump!

604
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,928
Oh, my God.

605
00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:18,968
- No.
- It's all my fault.

606
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:23,799
- Max, it's not your fault.
- Ohh.

607
00:47:28,212 --> 00:47:31,113
- Look!
- Max!

608
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:35,743
I hate it when that happens.

609
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:37,480
Well.

610
00:47:37,621 --> 00:47:41,113
I told you, I can't die.
Dani, you all right?

611
00:47:41,225 --> 00:47:43,125
- Yeah!
- Okay, then, let's go!

612
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:47,324
Stop!

613
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,299
- I smell children.
- Marvelous.

614
00:47:53,403 --> 00:47:56,304
Hey, hey, cupcake, don't I get
your phone number? Your area code?

615
00:47:56,406 --> 00:48:00,001
- You want my route schedule?
- Oh, thou wouldst hate me
in the morning.

616
00:48:00,143 --> 00:48:02,976
- No, I wouldn’t.
- Oh, believe me, thou wouldst.

617
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,378
Party pooper.

618
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:08,817
What is this, sisters?

619
00:48:08,919 --> 00:48:10,853
Odds bodkins.

620
00:48:12,489 --> 00:48:14,514
Farewell, mortal bus boy.

621
00:48:14,658 --> 00:48:17,718
- Oh, my.
- What are those? What's that?

622
00:48:17,861 --> 00:48:19,351
- Um--
- What is that?
- Uh, hobgoblins.
- Oh.

623
00:48:19,496 --> 00:48:21,464
Ohh! Oh.

624
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:22,862
Bless you.

625
00:48:27,004 --> 00:48:30,531
- Enough!
- Uh, sisters, I'm very confused.

626
00:48:30,674 --> 00:48:34,235
I-- I smell children,
but I-- I don't see children.

627
00:48:34,378 --> 00:48:37,313
I-- I've lost my power!

628
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:40,076
- Enough, enough, enough!
- Sorry.

629
00:48:40,217 --> 00:48:41,844
- We are witches. We are evil!
- Evil.

630
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:45,046
What would Mother say
if she could see us like this?

631
00:48:45,188 --> 00:48:46,883
Oh.

632
00:48:47,024 --> 00:48:48,889
- Mother.
- Mother.

633
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:54,730
- Master!
- Master!
- Master! Ohh!

634
00:48:54,865 --> 00:48:56,730
- Oh, my!
- He will help us!

635
00:48:56,867 --> 00:49:00,894
- What kind of costumes are these?
- Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!

636
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:03,199
It's the Sanderson Sisters,
right?

637
00:49:03,307 --> 00:49:06,401
-At your service.
-Yes, yes.
-Haven't seen you for centuries.

638
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:11,742
But what the heck? Why don't you come
in? Come in to the non-smoking section.

639
00:49:11,882 --> 00:49:15,613
- Come on, come on, right this way.
- Oh, I can't believe it's him!

640
00:49:15,752 --> 00:49:17,686
Don't step on my tail!

641
00:49:21,224 --> 00:49:25,251
- Officer! Officer!
- Officer, we need your help.

642
00:49:25,395 --> 00:49:27,420
What's the problem?

643
00:49:27,564 --> 00:49:29,794
- Tell him.
- Go ahead.

644
00:49:29,933 --> 00:49:32,265
Well, um--

645
00:49:32,402 --> 00:49:35,098
Well, you see, for--
I just, I just moved here.

646
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:41,038
W-Well, you see, i-it's like this.
I-- I, um--

647
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:44,773
I broke into the old Sanderson
house and I brought the witches
back from the dead.

648
00:49:44,915 --> 00:49:47,076
See, I even have the book.

649
00:49:49,286 --> 00:49:52,414
- You lit the black fame candle?
- Yeah.

650
00:49:56,626 --> 00:49:59,959
Come on. Okay, let's
get on the sidewalk.

651
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:04,758
And he's a virgin.

652
00:50:12,042 --> 00:50:13,942
Come here.

653
00:50:16,646 --> 00:50:20,275
- Are you a virgin?
- Yeah.

654
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:22,284
Really.

655
00:50:22,386 --> 00:50:24,479
Look, I'll get it tattooed
on my forehead, okay?

656
00:50:24,621 --> 00:50:26,748
- Officer, this is not a prank.
- Really!

657
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:31,453
Hey! I put my life on the line
to protect this community,
and you punks pull this?

658
00:50:31,561 --> 00:50:33,119
- Get outta here.
- Come on, Dani.

659
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:35,130
And take that cat with ya.

660
00:50:39,803 --> 00:50:44,172
- What's so funny, Eddie?
- Ahh,just a bunch of kids
pullin' my chain.

661
00:50:47,477 --> 00:50:49,342
They thought I was a real cop.

662
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:10,364
I want you to meet
the little woman.

663
00:51:12,102 --> 00:51:16,129
- He has a little woman.
- Sounds tasty.

664
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:17,900
- Today--
-Swimmingpool, swimmingpool--

665
00:51:18,041 --> 00:51:20,407
- Petunia face.
- What?

666
00:51:20,544 --> 00:51:23,911
Would you stop clicking?
We have company!

667
00:51:24,047 --> 00:51:26,311
- I don't care who's here.
I'm sick and tired...
- Sisters.

668
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:29,852
- of these dressing-up games.
- Satan has married Medusa.
See the snakes in her hair?

669
00:51:29,953 --> 00:51:32,717
- I don't wanna play in this.
I don't wanna play.
- Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh!

670
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:38,023
My three favorite witches.

671
00:51:38,128 --> 00:51:40,892
Aren’t you broads a little old
to be trick-or-treating?

672
00:51:41,031 --> 00:51:44,694
- We'll be younger in the morning.
- Yes.

673
00:51:44,801 --> 00:51:48,737
- Yeah, sure. Me too.
- I went out with him Valentine's Day.

674
00:51:48,872 --> 00:51:50,396
Excuse me.

675
00:51:54,044 --> 00:51:57,571
Wow! Neat brooms!

676
00:52:01,885 --> 00:52:03,284
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

677
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:05,547
Forget the kids.
I'm serving you from my cauldron.

678
00:52:05,655 --> 00:52:07,885
- Winnie!
- Yes?
- For you.

679
00:52:07,991 --> 00:52:11,085
Master, I plague thee.
What about the book?

680
00:52:11,228 --> 00:52:14,595
We'll get to the book later.
Mary, go long!

681
00:52:16,066 --> 00:52:18,432
Yeah! You could be
a tight end!

682
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:23,597
Master, would thou
dance with me?

683
00:52:26,743 --> 00:52:28,768
Behold!

684
00:52:28,912 --> 00:52:30,777
A torture chamber.

685
00:52:40,924 --> 00:52:44,587
Honey, I lost five pounds
according to the bathroom--

686
00:52:44,694 --> 00:52:46,958
- Now there's a Stain master carpet...
- Master.

687
00:52:47,097 --> 00:52:49,588
that handles foot traffic
like never before.

688
00:52:51,601 --> 00:52:55,731
Okay, that's it. Party's over!

689
00:52:55,839 --> 00:53:00,742
Get out of my house!
Get outta here! Get outta my house!

690
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:03,813
- Sorry.
- Calm down, puddin' face.

691
00:53:03,947 --> 00:53:06,006
- Shove it, Satan.
- Ohh.

692
00:53:06,149 --> 00:53:09,641
- Thou should not speak to
Master in such a manner.
- Mm-mmm.

693
00:53:09,786 --> 00:53:13,483
- They call me Master.
- Wait'll you see what
I'm gonna call ya.

694
00:53:13,623 --> 00:53:17,753
Now, tart face, take your Clark bars
and get out of my house!

695
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:21,830
Make us!

696
00:53:21,965 --> 00:53:25,162
- Yeah!
- Honey bunch.

697
00:53:25,302 --> 00:53:28,169
Ralph! Sic 'em!

698
00:53:35,645 --> 00:53:37,670
Winnie! Winnie!

699
00:53:37,814 --> 00:53:40,180
- My broom!
- My broom!
- My broom!

700
00:53:40,317 --> 00:53:43,980
Purloined! Curses!

701
00:53:44,087 --> 00:53:47,955
Sisters, look. 'Tis the
chocolate-covered finger
of a man named Clark.

702
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:50,686
Mmm. Ooh! Ugh!

703
00:53:50,827 --> 00:53:53,352
It's candy. Why would
the master give us candy?

704
00:53:53,496 --> 00:53:55,293
- Because he is not our master.
- He isn't?

705
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:57,298
- And these are not hobgoblins.
- Ohh!

706
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,061
- See?
- Ohh!
- Cool it, man!

707
00:53:59,202 --> 00:54:03,002
A child! Ohh!

708
00:54:03,106 --> 00:54:07,065
- Weirdos!
- Weirdos!
- Sisters!
- Mmm.

709
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:10,236
- All Hallows Eve has become
a night of frolic...
- Oh.

710
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:13,144
- where children wear costumes
and run amok!
- Oh!

711
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:16,981
Amok! Amok, amok,
amok, amok, amok--

712
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:20,420
- Oh, Winnie, just one child.
- No!

713
00:54:20,557 --> 00:54:24,152
Ah, great. How are we ever gonna
find Mom and Dad in this place?

714
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:28,257
Hi, hi, hi. Hi.

715
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:36,838
Owww! Whoo!

716
00:54:39,542 --> 00:54:42,443
Those fingers through my hair

717
00:54:42,579 --> 00:54:45,742
Thatsly ''come hit her''stare

718
00:54:45,882 --> 00:54:48,009
That strips my conscience bare

719
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:50,177
It's witchcraft

720
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:52,221
- I'm gonna look for Mom.
- Baby!

721
00:54:52,322 --> 00:54:55,416
-And I got no defense for it
- I can't see a thing!

722
00:54:55,558 --> 00:54:58,550
- Whoo! Waah! Whoo!
- The heat is too intense for it

723
00:54:58,662 --> 00:55:03,361
What good would
common sense for it do

724
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:05,366
- Aaah!
- It's witchcraft

725
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:09,962
- Oh. Dad!
- It's not Dad. It's '' Dadcula.''

726
00:55:10,106 --> 00:55:14,805
Oh, my goodness. Who must this
charming young blood donor be?

727
00:55:14,944 --> 00:55:17,640
Dad! Something terrible
happened.

728
00:55:17,781 --> 00:55:20,807
- Dani? What's wrong? Wh-Wh--
- No, Dani's fine.

729
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:23,248
Good. Excuse me. Come here.

730
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:29,155
Mom?

731
00:55:34,097 --> 00:55:36,657
- Mom?
- Hmm?

732
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:39,394
What are you supposed to be?

733
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:41,936
Madonna.

734
00:55:42,038 --> 00:55:46,407
Well, you know--
Well, obviously. Don't ya think?

735
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:50,912
Shoot, Max. Look,
whatever it is, just tell me.

736
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:52,914
- Come here.
- What?

737
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:55,314
This cat here, Binx, right?
He can talk.

738
00:55:55,452 --> 00:55:57,579
My brother's a virgin:
he lit the black fame candle.

739
00:55:57,687 --> 00:56:00,520
The witches are back from the dead
and they're after us. We need help.

740
00:56:00,657 --> 00:56:02,648
How much candy
have you had, honey?

741
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:05,260
Mom, I haven't O.D.'d.
I haven't even had a piece.

742
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:09,696
They're real witches, they can
fy, and they're gonna eat all
the kids in Salem. They're real!

743
00:56:09,833 --> 00:56:13,701
All right, let's just
find your father.

744
00:56:13,837 --> 00:56:16,772
It's such an ancient pitch

745
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:20,036
But one I wouldn't switch

746
00:56:20,176 --> 00:56:23,270
- 'Cause there's non icer witch
- Slither about.

747
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,678
- Find them!
- Oh, no, I'll never switch

748
00:56:25,815 --> 00:56:28,943
- Ohh! Aah!
- 'Cause there's non icer witch

749
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:31,953
Than you

750
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:34,615
I put a spell on you

751
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:38,353
And now you're mine

752
00:56:38,495 --> 00:56:40,554
- Max, I love you, but enough is enough.
- Come on, Dad, if I was
gonna pull your chain--

753
00:56:40,697 --> 00:56:42,528
- Now, just calm down.
- But they're gonna come--

754
00:56:42,665 --> 00:56:45,133
- Don't you see how crazy this sounds?
- Max! Max!

755
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:48,068
- Max, really--
- They're here! They're here!
- I ain't gonna take none
of your runnin' 'round

756
00:56:48,204 --> 00:56:51,537
- I ain't gonna take none
of your puttin'me down
- Did you find them?
- Sorry.

757
00:56:51,674 --> 00:56:54,541
- Get out there and find them.
- Nobody's here, sweetheart.

758
00:56:54,677 --> 00:56:57,703
- Here. Hold this.
- Sweetheart, nobody's here.
- Wait. Max. Max!
- Where are you going?

759
00:56:57,847 --> 00:57:00,407
- i put a spell on you
- Sarah!

760
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:03,542
-And now you're mine
- Bye.

761
00:57:03,686 --> 00:57:07,213
- Get over here! Did you find them?
- Find who?

762
00:57:07,357 --> 00:57:09,985
I ain't lyin'
No, I ain't lyin'

763
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:12,653
- Hey, cut the music! Cut the music!
- Hey, man, I'm in the middle of a song!

764
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:15,595
It's an emergency!
Only for a minute!

765
00:57:15,732 --> 00:57:18,530
Will everybody listen up,
please?

766
00:57:18,635 --> 00:57:20,398
- No. You’re just getting
everybody worked up.
- Well, listen to him.
Listen to him. He's fine!

767
00:57:20,537 --> 00:57:23,233
- Your kids are in danger.
- What do you mean?

768
00:57:23,373 --> 00:57:26,900
3OO years ago the Sanderson
Sisters bewitched people.

769
00:57:27,043 --> 00:57:30,012
Now they've returned
from their grave.

770
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:32,240
Hey, man, I'm serious!
It's not a joke!

771
00:57:32,382 --> 00:57:33,906
- All right, this has gone far enough.
- No, wait a minute.

772
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:36,075
I know this sounds dumb,

773
00:57:36,219 --> 00:57:38,084
but they're here tonight.

774
00:57:38,221 --> 00:57:40,382
They're right over there!

775
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,361
- Aah!
- Ohh.
- Wow.
- Thank you, Max,

776
00:57:48,431 --> 00:57:51,594
for that marvelous introduction.

777
00:57:53,403 --> 00:57:57,362
i put a spell on you

778
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:59,874
And now you're mine

779
00:58:01,611 --> 00:58:05,809
You can't stop
the things I do

780
00:58:05,949 --> 00:58:09,441
- I ain't lyin'
- No! No!

781
00:58:09,586 --> 00:58:10,985
- Ohh
- Don't listen to them!

782
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,917
Been3OOyears

783
00:58:13,022 --> 00:58:15,252
Right down to the day

784
00:58:15,358 --> 00:58:17,553
Now the witch is back

785
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:21,289
And there's hell to pay

786
00:58:21,431 --> 00:58:25,299
i put a spell on you

787
00:58:25,435 --> 00:58:27,903
- Good joke. Happy Halloween.
Thanks a lot.
- No, man, I'm serious!

788
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:30,973
- Yeah, yeah, I know.
You had, you had your fun.
- You gotta believe me! I'm not kidding!

789
00:58:31,107 --> 00:58:33,302
And now you're mine

790
00:58:33,443 --> 00:58:35,968
All right. Yeah, gear up.
Let's go, guys.

791
00:58:37,814 --> 00:58:40,146
Hello, Salem!

792
00:58:40,283 --> 00:58:43,446
My name's Winifred!
What's yours?

793
00:58:43,553 --> 00:58:45,987
i put a spell on you

794
00:58:46,122 --> 00:58:49,819
-And now you're gone
- Gone, gone, gone, so long

795
00:58:49,959 --> 00:58:52,655
My whammy fell on you

796
00:58:52,795 --> 00:58:56,322
-And it was strong
-So strong, so strong, so strong

797
00:58:56,466 --> 00:58:59,367
Your wretched little lives
have all been cursed

798
00:58:59,502 --> 00:59:02,665
'Cause of all the witches
working I'm the worst

799
00:59:02,805 --> 00:59:05,137
i put a spell on you

800
00:59:05,241 --> 00:59:08,540
-And now you're mine
- Binx, where are you?

801
00:59:10,179 --> 00:59:12,613
Watch out, watch out
Watch out, watch out

802
00:59:15,652 --> 00:59:19,383
If you don't believe
you'd better get superstitious

803
00:59:19,522 --> 00:59:22,355
-Ask my sisters
- Mom! Dad! Thank God!
- Hey, Max, great show.

804
00:59:22,492 --> 00:59:25,290
- Cover your ears!
- Cover our ears!
- i put a spell on you

805
00:59:27,196 --> 00:59:29,357
What? Ho-ho! Uh-oh!

806
00:59:29,499 --> 00:59:33,731
- i put a spell on you
- Oh, I wish we had a camera.

807
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:36,964
Ah-say-into-pie
Oppa-maybe-uppen-die

808
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:40,065
Ah-say-into-pie
Oppa-maybe-uppen-die

809
00:59:40,209 --> 00:59:43,235
- In-kama-koray-ah-ma
- In-kama-koray-ah-ma

810
00:59:43,379 --> 00:59:44,812
- Hey
- Hey!
- High
- High!

811
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:46,313
-Say
- Say!
- Bye
- Bye!

812
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:50,409
Bye

813
00:59:50,553 --> 00:59:52,248
Bye-bye

814
00:59:58,628 --> 01:00:02,530
Dance! Dance!
Dance until you die!

815
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:13,105
Oh, Binx, come on!

816
01:00:21,217 --> 01:00:24,380
- This is really bad!
- Max, come on! Calm down!

817
01:00:24,487 --> 01:00:27,456
Look, I want you to take Dani
back to your house and don't
let her out of your sight!

818
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:29,854
Max, I'm not leaving you.

819
01:00:31,894 --> 01:00:34,260
Okay, guys, who's goin'
for the jacuzzi?

820
01:00:36,232 --> 01:00:38,359
Yeah, Angelo, too bad.

821
01:00:42,238 --> 01:00:45,264
- Uh-oh.
- Get down!

822
01:00:48,111 --> 01:00:49,601
- I smell--
- Yes?

823
01:00:49,746 --> 01:00:51,941
- Winnie, I smell--
- Yes? Yes?

824
01:00:52,081 --> 01:00:55,448
I smell scrod.

825
01:00:55,585 --> 01:00:57,450
Scrod. You know.
It's a bottom dweller.

826
01:00:57,587 --> 01:00:59,782
You cook it sometimes with lovely
bread crumbs, little bit of margarine.

827
01:00:59,922 --> 01:01:01,719
Or oil. Olive oil is good.

828
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:05,726
But you have to cook it at 35O degrees
or else it tastes really-- Aah!

829
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:08,558
Sarah. Sarah!

830
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:21,409
I have an idea.

831
01:01:27,483 --> 01:01:30,646
- What is this place?
- Mmm, it reeks of children.

832
01:01:30,787 --> 01:01:33,187
It is a prison for children.

833
01:01:41,898 --> 01:01:44,662
Welcome to High School Hell.

834
01:01:44,801 --> 01:01:48,168
I'm your host,
Boris Karloff Jr.

835
01:01:50,506 --> 01:01:53,441
This way. I know I'm right.

836
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:56,512
It's time to meet
our three contestants:

837
01:01:56,646 --> 01:02:00,946
Sarah, Mary
and Winifred Sanderson.

838
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:03,450
Read any good spellbooks
lately?

839
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:07,622
Hag tracks!

840
01:02:09,492 --> 01:02:11,357
Get him!

841
01:02:13,996 --> 01:02:16,658
Hello. Welcome to the library.

842
01:02:25,775 --> 01:02:27,868
I would like a book.

843
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:34,246
Shh! Shh! Shh!

844
01:02:34,383 --> 01:02:36,351
What kind of book
are you looking for?

845
01:02:38,554 --> 01:02:41,022
We've got them!
We've got them, we've got them!

846
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:47,252
- What? Hello.
- I am looking for a children's book
- Yes?

847
01:02:56,405 --> 01:02:58,703
- Wretches!
- It's warm in here.

848
01:02:58,808 --> 01:03:00,708
Fire. Fire!

849
01:03:02,545 --> 01:03:03,910
Aah! It's hot! It's hot!

850
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:14,117
Farewell, Winifred Sanderson!
Ha ha!

851
01:03:14,257 --> 01:03:16,885
- Yes! Yay!
- Burn! Burn! All right!

852
01:03:16,993 --> 01:03:20,224
Whoo! Whoo!

853
01:03:22,331 --> 01:03:23,958
Yeah! All right!

854
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:27,401
- Yes!
- Yes!

855
01:03:28,771 --> 01:03:30,636
Yes!

856
01:03:38,281 --> 01:03:41,148
We did it, Binx.
We stopped them.

857
01:03:41,284 --> 01:03:46,813
I've wanted to do that for 3OO
years, since they took Emily.

858
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:53,326
You really miss her, don’t you?

859
01:03:53,462 --> 01:03:57,660
Man, you can't keep blaming yourself
for that. That happened so long ago.

860
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:59,893
Take good care of Dani, Max.

861
01:04:00,002 --> 01:04:04,496
You'll never know how precious
she is until you lose her.

862
01:04:08,978 --> 01:04:13,779
Hey, Binx! Where do you
think you’re goin'?

863
01:04:13,883 --> 01:04:16,852
You're a Dennison now, buddy.
One of us.

864
01:04:16,986 --> 01:04:19,682
Come on, Binx, let's go home.

865
01:04:19,822 --> 01:04:22,120
Home.

866
01:04:23,292 --> 01:04:24,953
Home.

867
01:04:31,567 --> 01:04:34,695
Mom? Dad?

868
01:04:34,837 --> 01:04:38,102
We got a new cat! Mom?

869
01:04:39,842 --> 01:04:42,709
Well, I guess they're
still partying. Come on in.

870
01:04:52,688 --> 01:04:54,883
You're my kitty now.

871
01:04:55,024 --> 01:04:59,324
You'll have milk and tuna fish every
day, and you'll only hunt mice for fun.

872
01:04:59,428 --> 01:05:03,888
You're going to turn me into
one of those fat, useless,
contented house cats.

873
01:05:04,033 --> 01:05:05,898
You betcha.

874
01:05:08,704 --> 01:05:13,334
- Yeah.
- You know, Binx,
I'll always take care of you.

875
01:05:13,442 --> 01:05:15,967
My children will
take care of you too.

876
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:21,414
And then their children after
that, and theirs after that,

877
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:25,748
forever and ever...

878
01:05:25,888 --> 01:05:28,254
and ever.

879
01:05:52,915 --> 01:05:57,545
Hello. I want my book.

880
01:06:04,327 --> 01:06:07,694
- You wanna smash some pumpkins?
- Nah.

881
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:10,960
Well, then you wanna look in
windows and watch babes undress?

882
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:13,762
It's 3:OO.
They're undressed already.

883
01:06:17,406 --> 01:06:20,807
- Well, then you think of something!
- I don't feel so good.

884
01:06:20,943 --> 01:06:24,140
- It's 'cause you're eatin'
too much candy, ya oinker!
- Seek them out, Mary.

885
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:26,612
- Seek them out.
- Okay, Winnie.

886
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:35,318
- Yes!
- Yo, witch. Get your face off my shoe.

887
01:06:35,458 --> 01:06:38,825
- Uhh, wrong boy.
- Natch!
- Ohh, sorry, Winnie.

888
01:06:38,961 --> 01:06:43,057
Why, why, why was I cursed
with such idiot sisters?

889
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:47,598
-Just lucky, I guess.
- Ohh!

890
01:06:47,703 --> 01:06:52,436
Oh, man, how come it's always
the ugly chicks that stay out late?

891
01:06:55,044 --> 01:06:57,512
Chicks?

892
01:06:57,646 --> 01:07:01,946
We haven't much time left!
We shall have to-- We shall have
to make the potion from memory!

893
01:07:02,051 --> 01:07:04,246
Hey! Let us outta here!

894
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:07,845
- Yeah, we're really sorry.
- We think you’re really cute.

895
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:09,753
- Hush!
- Aaah!

896
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:12,521
- I've got to think.
- Ohh.

897
01:07:12,661 --> 01:07:15,494
- Please!
- Remember. Remember.

898
01:07:15,631 --> 01:07:17,622
- Remember, Winnie, remember.
- Remember, Winnie, remember.

899
01:07:17,733 --> 01:07:20,668
- Remember, Winnie, remember.
- Remember, Winnie, remember.
- Now I remember!

900
01:07:20,803 --> 01:07:22,703
- I was here.
- Yes.
- The book was there.
- Uh--

901
01:07:22,838 --> 01:07:26,535
You, Mary, you were here. Sarah, you
were in the back, dancing idiotically.

902
01:07:26,675 --> 01:07:28,939
- And the book said--
- Yes?
- I remember it like it was yesterday.

903
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:33,982
- Yes?
- Oil of boil...
- Mmm?
- and a dead man's nose.

904
01:07:34,083 --> 01:07:36,313
- Dead man's toes!
- She's trying to concentrate!

905
01:07:36,419 --> 01:07:38,148
- No.
- Go! Go, go, go!

906
01:07:38,254 --> 01:07:40,654
- His thumbs.
- Thumbs? Could be thumbs.
- Or was it his gums?

907
01:07:40,756 --> 01:07:43,316
- I don't know. Thumbs, gums.
- Or dead man's buns.
- Dead man's buns. Buns.

908
01:07:43,426 --> 01:07:44,893
- Sounds like--
- Mums?
- Mums.

909
01:07:45,027 --> 01:07:46,892
- Funs.
- Funs.
- Chungs?
- Chungs? Mmm!

910
01:07:47,029 --> 01:07:50,328
- It's chungs!
- Chungs?
- Dead man's chungs!

911
01:07:50,433 --> 01:07:53,027
There is no such thing
as chungs.

912
01:07:53,169 --> 01:07:54,727
- You're right.
- I am? I'm right?

913
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:57,896
It's no use. I don't
remember the ingredients.

914
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:01,840
I-- I-- I've got to
have my book!

915
01:08:05,781 --> 01:08:10,013
- Leave him alone!
- Aaah! I'm gonna puke!

916
01:08:11,554 --> 01:08:14,216
Book!

917
01:08:14,356 --> 01:08:18,224
Come home
or make thyself known!

918
01:08:34,810 --> 01:08:37,210
- Hi.
- Hi.

919
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:45,549
Oh, my God. It's 5:OO.

920
01:08:45,654 --> 01:08:48,555
My parents are gonna kill me.

921
01:08:48,657 --> 01:08:52,787
- I should go.
- I wish you could stay.

922
01:08:58,501 --> 01:09:00,696
Poor Binx.

923
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:03,271
Yeah. Poor Binx.

924
01:09:05,508 --> 01:09:09,410
- We owe him a lot.
- Yeah.

925
01:09:09,512 --> 01:09:13,414
Look, cou-- could we find
some kind of way to help him?

926
01:09:16,118 --> 01:09:18,609
The book.

927
01:09:18,754 --> 01:09:21,621
The witches used it to put
the spell on him.

928
01:09:21,757 --> 01:09:24,624
Maybe there's a way in here
to take it off.

929
01:09:26,195 --> 01:09:29,995
Mmm, I don't know.
Binx told us not to open it.

930
01:09:30,132 --> 01:09:32,999
Well, the witches are dead.
What harm could it do?

931
01:09:38,207 --> 01:09:40,903
Well, just be careful.

932
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:43,478
I will.

933
01:09:43,612 --> 01:09:46,240
- Hold my hand.
- All right.

934
01:09:50,486 --> 01:09:51,851
Nothing weird so far.

935
01:09:56,992 --> 01:10:00,018
Winnie, oh, do you wanna hit me?
Would that cheer you up?

936
01:10:00,162 --> 01:10:04,292
- Okay. There you go.
- This is the end.

937
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:06,698
- No.
- I feel it.
- Okay.

938
01:10:06,835 --> 01:10:11,772
We are doomed. I feel
the icy breath of death upon my neck.

939
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:15,669
- Mary?
- What?
- Take me to the window.

940
01:10:15,811 --> 01:10:17,301
- This one?
- I wish to say good-bye.

941
01:10:17,413 --> 01:10:18,880
Yes, Winnie.

942
01:10:19,014 --> 01:10:20,379
- Good-bye.
- Bye-bye.

943
01:10:20,516 --> 01:10:23,041
- Good-bye, cruel world.
- Bye-bye, cruel world.

944
01:10:23,185 --> 01:10:25,278
- Good-bye to life.
- Bye-bye, life.

945
01:10:25,387 --> 01:10:28,049
- Good-bye, good-bye.
- Good-bye-bye.

946
01:10:28,190 --> 01:10:30,215
- Good-bye to all that.
- To all that.

947
01:10:32,695 --> 01:10:35,186
- Sister! Observe!
- What?
- They've opened it!

948
01:10:35,331 --> 01:10:37,959
Ha ha! Just when our time
was running out!

949
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:42,902
- Come! We fy!
- We fy! On what do we fy?

950
01:10:53,215 --> 01:10:56,651
Ahh! Into the night! Ahh!

951
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:13,265
Winnie?

952
01:11:15,404 --> 01:11:18,862
Broom, ho!

953
01:11:18,974 --> 01:11:20,942
Ohh!

954
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:26,948
Oh, listen to this.

955
01:11:27,082 --> 01:11:31,451
Only a circle of salt can protect
thy victims from thy power.

956
01:11:40,496 --> 01:11:42,964
- We were just trying to help you.
- Well, don't!

957
01:11:43,098 --> 01:11:46,192
Nothing good can come
from this book. You got it?

958
01:11:58,314 --> 01:12:00,714
- Maybe we should go now.
- Okay.

959
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:13,420
Mom? Dad?

960
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:20,633
Still not home. That's weird.

961
01:12:20,769 --> 01:12:23,829
Must be having a great time.

962
01:12:23,972 --> 01:12:26,907
I don't know.
Something's not right.

963
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:30,672
I'd feel a lot safer walking
home if we had some salt.

964
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:47,185
Salt.

965
01:12:47,329 --> 01:12:49,194
Ahh!

966
01:12:50,833 --> 01:12:52,858
What's it say?

967
01:12:53,001 --> 01:12:56,664
Uh, it says form a circle of
salt to protect from zombies,

968
01:12:56,805 --> 01:12:59,137
witches and old boyfriends.

969
01:12:59,241 --> 01:13:01,141
Yeah? And what about
new boyfriends?

970
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:13,044
Dani.

971
01:13:15,557 --> 01:13:17,457
Dani!

972
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:27,232
Max, the book is gone.

973
01:13:28,604 --> 01:13:31,505
I'm telling you,
something's weird.

974
01:13:33,876 --> 01:13:35,343
- Dani, wake up.
- Trick or treat!

975
01:13:37,613 --> 01:13:40,411
- Looking for this?
- Or this?

976
01:13:47,289 --> 01:13:49,189
Boy down.

977
01:13:51,226 --> 01:13:53,990
Salt! Ha!

978
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:57,259
- What a clever little white witch.
- Yeah!

979
01:13:57,399 --> 01:14:00,163
But it will not save
thy friends. No.

980
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:03,238
Come, sisters. The candle's
magic is almost spent.

981
01:14:03,372 --> 01:14:05,932
- Dawn approaches.
- Bye-bye.

982
01:14:06,074 --> 01:14:08,872
Max!

983
01:14:08,977 --> 01:14:13,038
Put me down! Let me go!
Aaah! Put me down!

984
01:14:19,988 --> 01:14:22,115
Dani? Dani?

985
01:14:25,994 --> 01:14:28,724
Dani!

986
01:14:33,068 --> 01:14:35,127
Max. Max.

987
01:14:35,270 --> 01:14:38,239
- Ohh.
- Get up.
- Ohh.
- Are you okay?

988
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:40,865
- Ohh.
- Come on, get up.
- Where's Dani?

989
01:14:41,677 --> 01:14:45,306
Use thy voice, Sarah!
Fill the sky!

990
01:14:45,447 --> 01:14:48,314
Bring the little brats to die!

991
01:14:53,255 --> 01:14:56,486
Come, little children

992
01:14:56,625 --> 01:15:00,755
I'll take thee away

993
01:15:00,863 --> 01:15:03,798
Into a land

994
01:15:03,932 --> 01:15:08,426
Of enchantment

995
01:15:08,537 --> 01:15:11,995
Come, little children

996
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:16,076
The time's come to play

997
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:19,670
Here in my garden

998
01:15:19,815 --> 01:15:24,912
Of magic

999
01:15:30,659 --> 01:15:32,024
- Dani!
- Dani!

1000
01:15:39,234 --> 01:15:42,032
Hey! Hey, you guys!

1001
01:15:42,170 --> 01:15:46,266
Don't listen to her!
Hey! Up here!

1002
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:49,776
- Don't listen to her!
- Max! Max, I've figured it out.

1003
01:15:49,878 --> 01:15:53,006
- What?
- Winifred said...

1004
01:15:53,148 --> 01:15:55,673
the candle's magic
will soon be spent...

1005
01:15:55,817 --> 01:15:58,149
and dawn approaches.

1006
01:15:58,253 --> 01:16:02,383
The black fame candle only brought
them back for this one Halloween night.

1007
01:16:02,524 --> 01:16:05,391
And unless they can steal
the lives of children,

1008
01:16:05,527 --> 01:16:09,019
when the sun comes up
they're dust.

1009
01:16:09,164 --> 01:16:11,860
Yeah, but how can we
make the sun come up?

1010
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,197
They've got Dani.

1011
01:16:15,337 --> 01:16:17,669
We need a miracle.

1012
01:16:35,390 --> 01:16:37,858
The children are coming.

1013
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:41,191
- Ohh! Well done, sister Sarah.
- Mmm! Good, good, good, good!

1014
01:16:45,701 --> 01:16:47,862
Let me out of here!

1015
01:16:49,638 --> 01:16:52,698
Hurry, okay? Oh, watch out!

1016
01:16:52,808 --> 01:16:56,767
Come on! Get out of the way!
Move it!

1017
01:16:59,281 --> 01:17:03,012
- Aaah! I'm gonna ralph.
- Open up!

1018
01:17:03,118 --> 01:17:05,450
No more candy, please!
Oww! Oww!

1019
01:17:05,587 --> 01:17:09,045
- Soon the lives of all thy
little friends will be mine,
- Oww! Oww!

1020
01:17:09,157 --> 01:17:11,955
and I shall be young
and beautiful again forever.

1021
01:17:12,094 --> 01:17:16,224
It doesn't matter how young or old
you are! You sold your soul!

1022
01:17:16,331 --> 01:17:20,358
You're the ugliest thing that's
ever lived, and you know it!

1023
01:17:21,737 --> 01:17:24,604
You die first.

1024
01:17:45,193 --> 01:17:47,423
- No!
- Ahh! 'Tis ready!

1025
01:17:47,529 --> 01:17:49,429
- Pry open her mouth.
- Gladly.

1026
01:17:49,531 --> 01:17:51,499
- Dani, don't drink it!
- Shut up, you!

1027
01:17:51,633 --> 01:17:53,567
- Don't drink it, Dani!
- Come on, open your mouth.

1028
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:56,729
- Open up--
- Aah!
- Aah! She bit me!

1029
01:18:00,442 --> 01:18:01,500
She bit me, Winnie!

1030
01:18:01,810 --> 01:18:03,277
Prepare to die!

1031
01:18:03,512 --> 01:18:05,309
- Again.
- You!

1032
01:18:05,447 --> 01:18:08,507
- You have no powers here, you fool!
- Hollywood!

1033
01:18:08,650 --> 01:18:11,619
- Maybe not!
- Come here!
- But there's a power
greater than your magic,

1034
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:14,120
- and that's knowledge!
- Hey, come on, man!

1035
01:18:14,222 --> 01:18:17,749
- And there's one thing that
I know that you don't!
- Ohh!

1036
01:18:17,859 --> 01:18:19,759
And what is that, dude?

1037
01:18:21,329 --> 01:18:23,524
Daylight savings time.

1038
01:18:23,665 --> 01:18:26,099
'' Daylight savings time.''

1039
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:30,763
- Winnie!
- Aaah!
- Aaah!

1040
01:18:30,872 --> 01:18:33,363
The sun! No!

1041
01:18:33,508 --> 01:18:36,944
- Max! Get me out of here!
- The sun!

1042
01:18:40,082 --> 01:18:41,709
It hurts!

1043
01:18:44,219 --> 01:18:46,813
- Don't worry, Binx!
I've got you! I'm here!
- Aah! Hot! Hot cat! Hot cat!

1044
01:18:46,922 --> 01:18:49,550
Hey! Let me outta here!

1045
01:18:51,093 --> 01:18:55,223
Help! Help! Hey! Hollywood!
Help us out here.

1046
01:18:59,835 --> 01:19:03,737
- Tubular.
- Aaah! Aaah!

1047
01:19:05,107 --> 01:19:07,735
- Yes!
- Let me outta here, man!

1048
01:19:07,876 --> 01:19:10,640
- Come on, Dani, let's go!
- Let me outta here, man!

1049
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:13,909
Max! I wanna see her
turn to dust!

1050
01:19:17,219 --> 01:19:19,084
Pump it!

1051
01:19:21,389 --> 01:19:23,254
Allison!

1052
01:19:36,571 --> 01:19:38,596
I am alive!

1053
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:41,174
Damn that boy.
He's tricked us again.

1054
01:19:41,276 --> 01:19:44,336
- Oh, you're right. You're always right.
I don't know how you do it--
- It's my curse!

1055
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:49,349
- That, and you two. Get off me,
you thundering oafs!
- Ohh! Sorry.

1056
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:53,444
Look! The candle's almost out,
and my potion--

1057
01:19:53,588 --> 01:19:55,783
My beautiful potion.

1058
01:19:55,924 --> 01:20:01,123
Look! There's just
enough left for one child.

1059
01:20:01,263 --> 01:20:02,787
Get the vial.

1060
01:20:04,466 --> 01:20:06,730
Come on! Move it!

1061
01:20:06,835 --> 01:20:08,735
Oh, joy! What luck!

1062
01:20:08,837 --> 01:20:11,704
This is perfect for that
little towheaded brat.

1063
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:14,799
- We have a child.
- Him!
- Him!

1064
01:20:14,943 --> 01:20:19,642
And look, Winnie, more children
are arriving. Come on in.

1065
01:20:19,781 --> 01:20:25,151
Winnie. Winnie, we will make more potion
because, Winnie, we have the book!

1066
01:20:25,287 --> 01:20:26,982
We haven't the time!

1067
01:20:27,122 --> 01:20:30,819
Besides, I want to get that little
rat-faced kid that called me--

1068
01:20:30,959 --> 01:20:33,928
- Oh! Oh, don't say it.
Don't even say it.
- Ugly?

1069
01:20:36,798 --> 01:20:40,131
- Oh, honey. I know.
- She really hurt my feelings.

1070
01:20:40,268 --> 01:20:43,567
- She's jealous.
- She doesn't even know me!
- I know. I know. And she said--

1071
01:20:45,674 --> 01:20:47,835
- You know, I always wanted a child.

Well, say what you want.

1094
01:22:38,086 --> 01:22:40,919
Billy! I killed you once!
