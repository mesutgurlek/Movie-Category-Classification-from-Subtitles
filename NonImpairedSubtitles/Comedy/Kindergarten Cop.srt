1
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,530
- Excuse me.
- Shithead.

2
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,049
You shouldn't be here.

3
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:59,552
- I know. Listen, you just guide ask for at least a $1,000?
- Okay. I'll get as much as I can. You gotta hide.

4
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:04,218
I mean his wife takes off his kid and couple of
million dollars, and what if we won't get a thousand.

5
00:03:04,221 --> 00:03:07,669
Shut up and stay hidden. Okay?
I told him I was coming alone.

6
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,619
Hey, Mr. Crisp.

7
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:05,288
How's it going?

8
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:09,249
You said you had information about my family.

9
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,460
Yeah, yeah, I do.

10
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:15,964
Well, let's have it.

11
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:23,382
Well, it's going to...
it's going to cost you. Like $1,000?

12
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:27,267
Okay, that's obviously not my final offer.

13
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:28,810
750 would be fine.

14
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:32,105
I mean, more than fine.

15
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:36,736
Just tell me what you have, Danny,
and I'll take good care of you.

16
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:38,904
Okay.

17
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:40,405
That sounds fair.

18
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:46,554
I was doing a delivery for Corky last week out of state,
and I ran into your ex.

19
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:48,029
How'd she look?

20
00:04:48,043 --> 00:04:51,166
She looked great, Mr. Crisp. Yeah.

21
00:04:51,169 --> 00:04:55,796
And she changed her hair and stuff,
but she looked like a million dollars.

22
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:58,924
In fact, she looked like about $3 million.

23
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:01,802
Did she see you?

24
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:07,282
No. I was changing a tire,
and suddenly, there she was across the street,...

25
00:05:07,285 --> 00:05:09,042
...taking her kid into this school.

26
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:11,353
My boy?

27
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,688
Looked great.

28
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,273
He looked very healthy.

29
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:19,443
You know, it's a real nice, healthy place where
they're living. It snows in winter there.

30
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:24,388
Danny, where are they?

31
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:27,828
At the school where I saw them--

32
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:31,555
Astoria Elementary School. That's--

33
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:34,593
It's in Astoria, Oregon.

34
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,761
All right Danny.

35
00:05:36,845 --> 00:05:39,181
Did you tell anyone else this?

36
00:05:39,264 --> 00:05:40,223
No.

37
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:41,433
No way.

38
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,385
Hey, I'm not stupid, Mr. Crisp.

39
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:47,389
You're not?

40
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:04,990
Danny.

41
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:08,925
Danny! No! Danny!

42
00:06:10,462 --> 00:06:13,395
Danny! Get up!

43
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,302
Don't you die on me!

44
00:06:18,637 --> 00:06:20,814
I didn't kill him.
I didn't kill him.

45
00:06:20,816 --> 00:06:22,216
Was it Crisp?

46
00:06:22,217 --> 00:06:27,010
I don't know. I didn't see anything. I was in the
wardrobe there and I don't. What are you doing?

47
00:06:27,562 --> 00:06:29,564
Hey, hey, hey!

48
00:06:29,648 --> 00:06:31,949
- Stop it! Don't do that!
- Don't go anywhere.

49
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:33,285
Let me go!

50
00:06:33,327 --> 00:06:37,312
- No! Let me off of him!
- I don't like what you've done.

51
00:06:37,373 --> 00:06:38,833
I really don't like it.

52
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:41,335
It feels terrible, and it looks dreadful.

53
00:06:41,418 --> 00:06:42,837
I'm trying my best.

54
00:06:42,878 --> 00:06:45,999
- Maybe your best isn't good enough.
- I'm back.

55
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:47,842
Oh, great.
Well, that was fast.

56
00:06:47,925 --> 00:06:49,468
It was easy.

57
00:06:49,472 --> 00:06:54,722
- I have some great, exciting, wonderful news, Mother.
- Oh, you always exaggerate, Cullen.

58
00:06:54,798 --> 00:06:56,716
Everything is always great, terrific.

59
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,718
So, what's so great?

60
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,263
I just found out where they're hiding.

61
00:07:01,346 --> 00:07:04,349
Are you serious?
You really know where he is?

62
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:06,434
Manicure, Mr. Crisp?

63
00:07:06,518 --> 00:07:09,437
Oh, how could I say no to you?

64
00:07:09,521 --> 00:07:10,689
Tell me.

65
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,107
What's happened?

66
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:16,526
Just let me handle this myself, Mother.
I know what I'm doing.

67
00:07:16,528 --> 00:07:18,613
Everything is under control.

68
00:07:26,138 --> 00:07:28,440
It's all right.
I'm a police officer.

69
00:07:28,482 --> 00:07:33,192
Crisp, you're under arrest.
Put your hands on your head slowly and get up!

70
00:07:33,195 --> 00:07:34,613
Kimble, not again!

71
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,614
Your hands!

72
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:36,657
They're up.

73
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,492
When are you going to leave me alone?

74
00:07:38,576 --> 00:07:41,128
- Drop the gun!
- He is right drop the gun!

75
00:07:41,141 --> 00:07:44,294
Hey, I'm a police officer.
This is an arrest.

76
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:46,441
This man's crazy.
Look at him.

77
00:07:46,445 --> 00:07:48,669
He wants to kill me.
You're just gonna stand there?

78
00:07:48,752 --> 00:07:50,846
- Freeze!
- Oh Jeez.

79
00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:52,397
I'm a cop you idiot!

80
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:55,141
I'm Detective John Kimble.
This man is under arrest.

81
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:57,143
Yeah! We will see about that.
I'm checking it out.

82
00:07:57,185 --> 00:08:02,548
You can't just walk in here and put a gun in my face.
I'm trying to get a manicure.

83
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:04,310
I have witnesses.

84
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,529
I have a witness, too.

85
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:09,115
It's murder one this time.

86
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:11,349
Now you're mine.

87
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:14,912
This son-of-a-bitch handcuffed me to a dead man!

88
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,330
A dead man!

89
00:08:16,414 --> 00:08:17,832
- Come on. Sit down.
- Sorry. Yeah.

90
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:23,750
- Now, did Danny ever say what Crisp's wife looked like?
- No.

91
00:08:23,721 --> 00:08:26,749
And did he ever say what name
she was using in Oregon?

92
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,150
He didn't say anything.

93
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:30,594
- Look, I just want to get out of here and go home.
- We'll go.

94
00:08:30,678 --> 00:08:33,255
- Right after the line up, I'll drive you home afterwards.
- No.

95
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:34,557
I'll even buy you dinner.

96
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,958
- No.
- Come on, Cindy. I'll even cook you dinner.

97
00:08:36,962 --> 00:08:39,560
- What do you say?
- I'm not doing any lineup, that's what I say.

98
00:08:39,564 --> 00:08:41,522
And there ain't jack shit you can do about it!

99
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:46,269
I've been after Crisp for four years, and she's
just gonna let my key witness walk her out of here?

100
00:08:46,272 --> 00:08:48,203
- I'm going in.
- Kimble, sit down!

101
00:08:48,207 --> 00:08:48,946
Okay. Sit down.

102
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,197
- Sit.
- Sit.

103
00:08:53,532 --> 00:08:56,951
Now listen to me.
He killed your boyfriend.

104
00:08:57,035 --> 00:09:00,458
All you have to do is point your finger,
and we can put this asshole away for 30 years.

105
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,794
He wasn't my boyfriend.
I hardly knew the guy.

106
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:12,550
I know you're in there.
I know what you want, but you ain't getting it.

107
00:09:12,555 --> 00:09:15,185
Never. No lineup, no testimony.

108
00:09:15,189 --> 00:09:19,324
So you take your handcuffs and shove them up your ass!
Now let me out of here!

109
00:09:20,003 --> 00:09:22,578
Slow down!
Open it and let me out!

110
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:33,536
O'Hara, meet Kimble.
Kimble's been on this a long time.

111
00:09:33,523 --> 00:09:36,150
- Oh! Hi.
- Let me take care of Cindy.

112
00:09:36,156 --> 00:09:37,986
She'll make Crisp.
I guarantee it.

113
00:09:38,028 --> 00:09:42,647
Well, what are you gonna do? Handcuff her
to the bumper of your car and take her for a ride?

114
00:09:42,653 --> 00:09:45,419
Let's just say I'm not going to offer to cook her dinner.

115
00:09:45,422 --> 00:09:47,437
Kimble, hold on a second. I wa--

116
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:52,273
- Difficult man. Got to get to know him.
- Oh, I can't wait.

117
00:10:05,356 --> 00:10:06,440
Aah!

118
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:17,158
Hey, baby.

119
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,202
What you mean, "Hey, baby"?

120
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,291
Adónde vas?

121
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,213
Shit!

122
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:32,841
Oh, excuse me.

123
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:35,343
I forgot to introduce myself.

124
00:10:37,062 --> 00:10:41,850
My name is John Kimble, and I love my car.

125
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,144
Yo, man, I'm just gonna keep a eye on it for you, all right?

126
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:46,646
You got a beautiful ride.

127
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,690
- Shit.
- Who does he think he is?

128
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:50,191
He's lucky I didn't kick his ass.

129
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,393
Open up.

130
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,520
You can't come in.

131
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,694
Thank you.

132
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:36,780
What the fuck?

133
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,680
All right, party's over.

134
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,591
Everyone go home.

135
00:11:58,543 --> 00:12:00,804
Next time, my place.

136
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,739
So who are you, man?

137
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,307
Shit!

138
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,727
I'm the party-pooper.

139
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:11,898
Hi, Cindy.

140
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:17,745
- Do you mind if I sit down?
- No.

141
00:12:17,808 --> 00:12:19,407
Sit down, man.

142
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:25,161
Oh, it's so nice to see you again.

143
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:27,923
What are you doing here, you asshole?

144
00:12:27,926 --> 00:12:33,510
Cindy, I don't like you using foul language,
not a classy girl like you.

145
00:12:33,512 --> 00:12:37,931
- Don't you have anything better to do?
- You don't understand.

146
00:12:37,974 --> 00:12:43,104
I have nothing else to do, and I have nowhere else to go.

147
00:12:43,188 --> 00:12:46,775
Why are you staring at me like that?

148
00:12:46,816 --> 00:12:48,401
I like you, Cindy.

149
00:12:48,485 --> 00:12:54,173
I'm going to be around you a lot--
days, nights, weekends, holidays.

150
00:12:54,177 --> 00:12:56,083
No. No, you can't.

151
00:12:56,088 --> 00:12:57,986
Yes, I can.

152
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:03,032
I'm going to hang out with you until the end of time.

153
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:06,619
All right, move it in. Let's go.

154
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,663
Step onto the numbers.

155
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,166
Face front.

156
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:15,712
Everybody, hands to your side.

157
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,464
That's the creep.

158
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:18,631
Who?

159
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,341
Number five.

160
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:21,968
That's him.

161
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:26,514
Good.

162
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:27,515
Very good.

163
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:32,963
Mr. Crisp, you will be remanded
into custody until your trial.

164
00:13:32,966 --> 00:13:34,898
Bailiff, remove the prisoner.

165
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:39,583
Shh. Don't say anything. Just take it easy.
I'll take care of it. Trust me.

166
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:46,910
You know what to do?

167
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:49,496
I'm your mother, aren't I?

168
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:03,074
- Mind if I talk to my friend a little bit?
- Hey, I'm not talking to anybody without my lawyer.

169
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,011
He's right in here.

170
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,765
Now, you give me the names of your...

171
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:18,691
...drug suppliers and distributors, and I'll tell
the judge what a nice, cooperative killer you are.

172
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:23,572
You think the jury's going to convict me
on the testimony of that junkie?

173
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:26,116
You could be right.

174
00:14:30,504 --> 00:14:34,943
But what about your wife?
You remember her?

175
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:38,962
All that hard-earned drug money she stole from you?

176
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:42,716
How much was it, $3 million?

177
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:46,136
I bet she would make a much better witness.

178
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:50,940
Kimble, you've wasted years chasing after me,
and what has it gotten you, hmm?

179
00:14:50,944 --> 00:14:52,141
Nothing.

180
00:14:52,145 --> 00:14:57,224
I'll be out of here in a week, and you'll still be
eating take-out food in that dump you live in.

181
00:14:57,248 --> 00:15:01,109
Yeah, I know all about you, Kimble.

182
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:04,237
Without me, you wouldn't even have a life.

183
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,215
My old lady left 'cause of the money.

184
00:15:07,217 --> 00:15:11,745
Yours left because she just couldn't stand the sight of you.

185
00:15:13,912 --> 00:15:16,433
I've never seen anyone so little eat so much.

186
00:15:16,436 --> 00:15:20,918
Yeah, I know. I'm hypoglycemic.
If I don't eat regularly, I get a little nuts.

187
00:15:21,005 --> 00:15:23,623
So... where you from?

188
00:15:23,627 --> 00:15:24,841
Austria.

189
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,844
How long you been a cop?

190
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,346
I been a cop for 12 years.

191
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:35,051
My father was a cop, my brother was a cop,
my mother was a cop's wife.

192
00:15:35,055 --> 00:15:37,245
And I have no hobbies.

193
00:15:37,287 --> 00:15:41,649
Good news. You two are booked on
the first flight after Portland tomorrow morning.

194
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:47,197
Now, I want you to locate Crisp's wife and offer her
immunity in exchange for her testimony against him.

195
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:53,203
No offense to O'Hallahan,
but this is my case, and I work alone.

196
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:55,205
He works alone.

197
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,206
Not anymore.

198
00:15:56,289 --> 00:16:00,335
She's going in undercover as a
substitute kindergarten teacher.

199
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:02,237
Not exactly a job for you.

200
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:05,849
I was a teacher before I joined the force.
Don't worry about we'll be fine.

201
00:16:05,883 --> 00:16:07,142
So what do I do?

202
00:16:07,144 --> 00:16:12,977
She locates the kid, you find the mother and the cash, and
Crisp spends the best use of his life making license plates.

203
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,308
Bon voyage.

204
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:18,812
Oh, and, Kimble, the name's O'Hara.

205
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:27,135
OK. Here's the wife at 17.
Real name's Rachel Myatt.

206
00:16:27,141 --> 00:16:29,440
She's from Hannibal, Missouri, class of '76.

207
00:16:29,443 --> 00:16:34,403
She is a cheerleader, first violin in the school orchestra,
captain of the girls' softball team.

208
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:40,783
Her ambition was "To travel, experience life,
and meet interesting people."

209
00:16:40,786 --> 00:16:42,545
- Like Crisp.
- Yeah.

210
00:16:43,686 --> 00:16:45,187
Okay.

211
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:50,659
Relax. Don't let him get to you.

212
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,973
That's her 10 years later.

213
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,475
It's a great shot of an ear.

214
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:00,319
- You get in touch with her parents?
- No. They're both dead.

215
00:17:00,321 --> 00:17:03,315
The only relative she's got left is the kid.

216
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,317
Hey.

217
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:16,100
Okay. This is the only picture we have of him.
Cullen Jr., aged 3 months.

218
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:17,620
That helps much.

219
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:19,381
It's the best I could do. Okay.

220
00:17:19,384 --> 00:17:20,582
Breakfast, sir? Ma'am?

221
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:22,983
- Please.
- No. No, no.

222
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:24,210
That's a first.

223
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,539
Listen, I was just thinking.

224
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:34,427
Maybe we should take a wild stab at getting to know
each other before we have to pretend we're man and wife.

225
00:17:34,443 --> 00:17:37,831
- What do you want to know?
- Well, how long have we been married?

226
00:17:38,859 --> 00:17:42,577
A long time. You see,
people don't expect us to talk much to each other.

227
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:45,648
- Hey, give me that.
- No. I want to read it, too.

228
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:46,608
Stop it.

229
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,026
Please?

230
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:49,611
Let me take a look.

231
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:51,113
Hey, come here.

232
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:57,035
If you don't stop screwing around back there,
this is what I'm gonna do with you.

233
00:18:01,198 --> 00:18:02,415
Ohh.

234
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:04,175
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.

235
00:18:04,147 --> 00:18:07,110
- What's wrong?
- I don't know. I just don't feel so good.

236
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,188
- You hungry?
- No. I got to get out of here right now.

237
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:11,489
I gotta go. Move. Move. Move.

238
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:16,429
Come on. Get those tree stumps out
of my way before I vomit all over them.

239
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:22,852
Is your wife okay, sir?

240
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:25,063
Compared to what?

241
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,988
Maybe it was the burrito.

242
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:39,617
Or it could've been the sausages.
I don't think it was the crab salad.

243
00:18:39,663 --> 00:18:42,122
It couldn't have been the doughnuts.

244
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:44,207
Excuse me.

245
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:48,586
Oh, I hate feeling like this.

246
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,380
I hate it, too.

247
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:53,883
Uh-oh.

248
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:55,627
Uh-oh what?

249
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:58,487
Uh-oh, pull over.

250
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:00,931
- Now?
- Yeah. Please hurry.

251
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,175
The key! Give me the key!

252
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:49,773
Do you need a hand?

253
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,044
You okay?

254
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:12,212
I'm fine.

255
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:26,476
I'll be fine.

256
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,105
Class starts at 9 O'Clock in the morning.

257
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:33,648
- I'll be fine. You know.
- Oh. You look much better already.

258
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:36,986
Oh. Kindergarten, 6-year-olds.

259
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,389
That's why I quit teaching, you know.

260
00:20:39,392 --> 00:20:43,410
I got so sick of other people's kids.

261
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:48,665
I was afraid that I'd never want to have any of my own.

262
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,464
I have a son.

263
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:00,176
He's 13.

264
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:03,680
I remember when he was 5.

265
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:06,641
He lives with his mother and stepfather.

266
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:14,229
- What's the matter?
- What is that?

267
00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:18,193
Oh, excuse me.
I forgot to tell you. This is my ferret.

268
00:21:18,437 --> 00:21:20,697
He doesn't bite.
Don't worry.

269
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:30,631
Come on.
Come on out.

270
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:33,376
This is all I need--
an obstacle.

271
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,086
A goddamn obstacle.

272
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:38,397
He sends me an obstacle. Here.

273
00:21:55,732 --> 00:21:57,609
Oh, God.

274
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:02,030
Don't worry.

275
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:03,531
I'm going to make it.

276
00:22:03,615 --> 00:22:06,951
I just need a minute.

277
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:11,554
I'll be ready in just a minute.
I just got--

278
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:15,168
Oh, God.

279
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:23,968
How do I look?

280
00:22:28,598 --> 00:22:30,558
Take off the gun.

281
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:34,270
That's a good idea.

282
00:22:37,524 --> 00:22:41,611
The little bastards are going to eat you alive.

283
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:45,240
Get some rest, and don't worry.

284
00:22:45,323 --> 00:22:48,284
I've been working undercover for a long time.

285
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:52,286
They're 6-year-olds.
How much trouble can they be?

286
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:57,794
On second thought, take the gun.

287
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:31,244
Matthew, I sent you to the principal's office
because you punched Jenny.

288
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:34,330
I know. She poisoned your hamsters.

289
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:37,476
She told me all about it, and she's very sorry.

290
00:23:37,477 --> 00:23:41,463
And I'm sorry that I didn't believe you.

291
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:45,967
- But you shouldn't punch people.
- But she--  - I know.

292
00:23:46,051 --> 00:23:48,845
Mr. Kimble, Miss Schlowski will see you now.

293
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:51,723
All right. Let's go back to class.

294
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:57,645
Can I help you?

295
00:23:57,729 --> 00:24:00,815
I'm John Kimble, your new kindergarten teacher.

296
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:05,570
We were expecting a Miss O'Hara.

297
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:08,490
There's been a change of plan.

298
00:24:09,783 --> 00:24:11,806
Four weeks into the new semester,...

299
00:24:11,807 --> 00:24:16,207
...my superintendent told me
I had to replace Mrs. Hagley,...

300
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:22,111
...a kindergarten teacher of 25 years' experience,
with an undercover police officer,...

301
00:24:22,115 --> 00:24:24,214
...and he wouldn't even tell me why.

302
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:27,760
I don't suppose you would do
me the courtesy of filling me in.

303
00:24:27,802 --> 00:24:29,520
I can't do that.

304
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:34,862
Oh. You can't do that.
I'm watching you.

305
00:24:34,933 --> 00:24:39,955
All I have to do is tell my parents that you're here for
something to do with the police,...

306
00:24:39,959 --> 00:24:44,542
...and they'll yank their kids out of this
school so fast, we'd have to close the place.

307
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:49,264
And don't you think I won't if
I feel my children are in any danger.

308
00:24:49,268 --> 00:24:50,717
They're not in danger.

309
00:24:54,077 --> 00:24:59,082
I assume you have some teaching experience.

310
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:01,626
They wouldn't have sent me otherwise.

311
00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:13,888
Just wait here a minute.

312
00:25:19,352 --> 00:25:23,648
Everybody sit down on the carpet!

313
00:25:28,737 --> 00:25:31,590
Good morning, everyone.

314
00:25:31,593 --> 00:25:35,660
Good morning, Miss Schlowski.

315
00:25:35,664 --> 00:25:40,649
Your teacher, Mrs. Hagley had
to go on an important trip for a few days.

316
00:25:40,732 --> 00:25:41,958
Where'd she go?

317
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:44,841
- That doesn't matter.
- Did she die?

318
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:49,589
- No, Lowell. She went to see someone.
- Did they die?

319
00:25:49,591 --> 00:25:51,676
No, Lowell.

320
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,636
Everyone dies, you know.

321
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,807
I know, but not for a long, long time.

322
00:25:57,891 --> 00:26:03,830
Now, until Mrs. Hagley comes back,
we have someone special to help.

323
00:26:04,314 --> 00:26:09,194
This is Mr. Kimble, your new kindergarten teacher.

324
00:26:16,785 --> 00:26:22,457
Now, let's everybody say, "Good morning, Mr. Kimble."

325
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:26,836
Good morning, Mr. Kimble.

326
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,380
Good morning.

327
00:26:28,463 --> 00:26:31,299
They're all yours.

328
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:33,385
I'll be watching you.

329
00:26:38,807 --> 00:26:40,183
Hi.

330
00:26:42,185 --> 00:26:43,846
How are you?

331
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:49,192
I'm very happy to be here.

332
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:52,795
First I would like to just get to know you.

333
00:26:57,992 --> 00:26:59,577
Quiet.

334
00:27:01,663 --> 00:27:04,499
I'm going to ask you a bunch of questions.

335
00:27:04,582 --> 00:27:07,502
I want to have them answered immediately.

336
00:27:07,585 --> 00:27:10,705
How many of you were born in Astoria?

337
00:27:13,633 --> 00:27:16,136
Come on. Raise your hands.
Let's see them.

338
00:27:18,638 --> 00:27:19,931
Okay, hmm.

339
00:27:20,014 --> 00:27:24,669
Now, anyone that was not born in Astoria,...

340
00:27:24,672 --> 00:27:27,522
...somewhere outside like California, raise your hands.

341
00:27:35,697 --> 00:27:39,398
- Yes.
- I need to go to the bathroom.

342
00:27:40,702 --> 00:27:42,612
Okay. You can go.

343
00:27:43,705 --> 00:27:45,623
Boys have a penis.

344
00:27:45,707 --> 00:27:48,126
Girls have a vagina.

345
00:27:50,754 --> 00:27:52,513
Thanks for the tip.

346
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:55,633
Yes?

347
00:27:55,717 --> 00:28:00,764
I need to go to the bathroom,
and I can't get these things off.

348
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:12,832
I'll get someone to help you.
I'll be right back, okay?

349
00:28:20,575 --> 00:28:25,914
You've learned that the "e" is often silent
when it immediately follows another vowel.

350
00:28:25,997 --> 00:28:28,500
Now write and say these words in which--

351
00:28:31,127 --> 00:28:36,925
Oh, um, class, uh, Catherine,
can you take over for me, please?

352
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:38,093
Thank you.

353
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:42,138
"E" is the fifth letter of the alphabet.

354
00:28:42,222 --> 00:28:46,365
- Yes, can I help you?
- I have a problem.

355
00:28:46,434 --> 00:28:51,136
Mr. Kimble, I need to go real bad.

356
00:28:52,148 --> 00:28:53,483
First day?

357
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:55,151
Yes.

358
00:28:55,235 --> 00:28:56,694
I'll take care of her.

359
00:28:56,778 --> 00:28:57,862
Thank you.

360
00:28:59,864 --> 00:29:03,493
You know, kindergarten is like the ocean.

361
00:29:03,576 --> 00:29:07,414
- You don't want to turn your back on it.
- They're okay.

362
00:29:07,497 --> 00:29:09,165
Don't worry.

363
00:29:09,249 --> 00:29:10,875
Everything is under control.

364
00:29:14,129 --> 00:29:15,714
No.

365
00:29:15,797 --> 00:29:17,432
Monsters.

366
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,054
What are you doing with this?

367
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:46,703
Aren't you going to break it up?

368
00:29:46,786 --> 00:29:50,865
No. Two more days of this, and he'll quit.

369
00:29:59,674 --> 00:30:03,311
Shut up!

370
00:30:04,512 --> 00:30:08,524
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up.

371
00:30:14,105 --> 00:30:15,023
No.

372
00:30:15,106 --> 00:30:16,724
Don't start this.

373
00:30:21,025 --> 00:30:22,425
Oh. No.

374
00:30:47,097 --> 00:30:48,431
Attention!

375
00:30:52,394 --> 00:30:55,814
This is your new class mascot.

376
00:30:55,897 --> 00:30:58,057
What happened to your dog?

377
00:30:58,061 --> 00:31:00,318
This is not a dog.

378
00:31:00,402 --> 00:31:01,820
This is a ferret.

379
00:31:01,903 --> 00:31:03,279
What's a ferret?

380
00:31:03,363 --> 00:31:06,639
- That's a ferret.
- Oh!

381
00:31:06,644 --> 00:31:11,085
- If he bites you, you get rabies and you die.
- No. That's not true.

382
00:31:11,121 --> 00:31:12,580
He never bites.

383
00:31:12,664 --> 00:31:14,082
Can I pet him?

384
00:31:14,124 --> 00:31:20,085
Sure, but one at a time, okay?
Good. Okay, next one. Come on.

385
00:31:20,088 --> 00:31:21,798
Yes.

386
00:31:21,881 --> 00:31:23,133
Good.

387
00:31:23,216 --> 00:31:24,584
Yeah.

388
00:31:25,885 --> 00:31:27,946
Good. Now we're having fun.

389
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:55,790
What's that supposed to mean?

390
00:31:55,874 --> 00:31:58,710
Mrs. Hagley is a lot better than you.

391
00:31:58,793 --> 00:32:00,420
Is she?

392
00:32:01,713 --> 00:32:03,381
Is she really?

393
00:32:05,341 --> 00:32:10,969
My mom's a teacher in this school,
and she's a lot better than you, too.

394
00:32:10,972 --> 00:32:12,015
Great.

395
00:32:12,098 --> 00:32:16,508
On Monday nights, my mom tutors and
Mrs. Quinn takes care of me.

396
00:32:16,511 --> 00:32:18,563
And she's better than you, too.

397
00:32:18,646 --> 00:32:20,190
Great.

398
00:32:20,273 --> 00:32:22,450
And Frankie, my swimming teacher,...

399
00:32:22,453 --> 00:32:26,738
...and Gus, my T-ball coach, are better than you, too.

400
00:32:28,365 --> 00:32:33,925
I really appreciate your honesty.
You happen to know someone that's not better than me?

401
00:32:36,873 --> 00:32:39,918
I don't know that many people.

402
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,680
John?

403
00:32:52,722 --> 00:32:54,391
Are you there?

404
00:32:58,937 --> 00:33:00,805
How did it go?

405
00:33:03,191 --> 00:33:05,443
Go away.

406
00:33:05,527 --> 00:33:07,696
It went that well, huh?

407
00:33:09,531 --> 00:33:12,283
You take over tomorrow.

408
00:33:12,367 --> 00:33:14,786
And blow our cover?

409
00:33:14,869 --> 00:33:16,371
Can't do it.

410
00:33:17,872 --> 00:33:19,958
They're horrible.

411
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:22,043
Tell me about it.

412
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,811
He's gay.

413
00:33:39,894 --> 00:33:43,064
What kind of a man teaches kindergarten?
He's obviously gay.

414
00:33:43,072 --> 00:33:47,327
Yeah. Well, I don't know.
A male kindergarten teacher isn't what I'm used to.

415
00:33:47,369 --> 00:33:49,912
Samantha calls him "The giant."

416
00:33:52,198 --> 00:33:54,725
- There he is.
- Where, honey?

417
00:33:59,105 --> 00:34:01,941
Holy cow, is that your new teacher?

418
00:34:01,983 --> 00:34:03,109
Yeah.

419
00:34:03,151 --> 00:34:04,735
Oh, my God.

420
00:34:05,795 --> 00:34:06,929
What are you doing?

421
00:34:06,933 --> 00:34:09,624
- I don't want him seeing me without wearing makeup.
- None of us are wearing makeup.

422
00:34:09,627 --> 00:34:12,326
God. You're married.
You're allowed to look like slobs.

423
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:15,830
Baby, be a good boy.
I'll be back later on to pick you up.

424
00:34:15,913 --> 00:34:17,331
Good morning, Mr. Kimble.

425
00:34:17,415 --> 00:34:18,332
Good morning.

426
00:34:18,416 --> 00:34:22,277
- I told you he was big.
- Yeah. Go and play with the kids, honey.

427
00:34:25,373 --> 00:34:29,850
Hi. I'm Jillian, Sylvester's mom.
I was wondering if you might have a minute?

428
00:34:29,857 --> 00:34:32,054
I'd like to speak with you.

429
00:34:32,138 --> 00:34:33,556
Sure.

430
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:34,891
Please.

431
00:34:34,974 --> 00:34:36,184
Thank you.

432
00:34:36,267 --> 00:34:39,385
A male kindergarten teacher.
That's unusual.

433
00:34:40,246 --> 00:34:44,974
- You're not from around here, are you?
- No. I'm not.

434
00:34:44,959 --> 00:34:47,519
- Neither am I.
- Huh.

435
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:53,718
Anyway, uh, I have a small problem.

436
00:34:53,802 --> 00:34:54,761
Yes?

437
00:34:54,803 --> 00:34:58,723
You see, Sylvester's father doesn't live with us anymore...

438
00:34:58,807 --> 00:35:04,804
...and--and I've just been worried about Sylvester.
He's been acting a little strange lately--

439
00:35:04,646 --> 00:35:06,648
You know, doing odd things.

440
00:35:06,731 --> 00:35:07,857
Like what?

441
00:35:07,941 --> 00:35:13,780
Well, it seems that's he's becoming
a little obsessed with playing with dolls.

442
00:35:13,822 --> 00:35:15,281
You know, it's weird.

443
00:35:15,365 --> 00:35:17,817
I think I can help you with that.

444
00:35:17,819 --> 00:35:20,955
- Really?
- He uses the dolls to look up girls' skirts.

445
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,290
I caught him doing it yesterday.

446
00:35:24,374 --> 00:35:29,893
- Oh. Oh, well, that's a relief.
- But I'll keep an eye on him, okay?

447
00:35:29,921 --> 00:35:31,464
Thank you.

448
00:35:31,506 --> 00:35:34,250
Does Sylvester ever see his father?

449
00:35:35,176 --> 00:35:38,638
No. No, not since he was 2.

450
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,516
His father lives in California.

451
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,263
- That is far away.
- Mm-hmm.

452
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:49,483
Well, if you give me his name and number,...

453
00:35:49,485 --> 00:35:52,819
...I could talk to him about taking more interest in his son.

454
00:35:52,861 --> 00:35:55,071
That's very kind of you, but I don't think so.

455
00:35:55,155 --> 00:35:58,382
But it's kind of tough on Sylvester, don't you think?

456
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:03,429
No. No, what's tough on Sylvester is the fact
that his father left us for another man.

457
00:36:04,706 --> 00:36:07,500
Are you married, Mr. Kimble?

458
00:36:08,543 --> 00:36:10,403
No, I'm not.

459
00:36:13,048 --> 00:36:15,883
He's not married, Mom!

460
00:36:16,551 --> 00:36:22,305
Welcome to Astoria, the single-parent capital of America.
Thank you for your time.

461
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:25,176
I pledge allegiance...

462
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:31,015
...to the flag of the United States of America,...

463
00:36:31,099 --> 00:36:35,395
...and to the republic for which it stands,...

464
00:36:35,436 --> 00:36:40,900
...one nation, under God, indivisible...

465
00:36:40,942 --> 00:36:45,337
...with liberty and justice for all.

466
00:36:50,752 --> 00:36:52,954
Are these all your lunches?

467
00:36:54,255 --> 00:36:57,217
You mean you eat other people's lunches?

468
00:36:57,258 --> 00:36:58,426
Stop it!

469
00:37:02,764 --> 00:37:06,634
Now we're going to do something extremely fun.

470
00:37:06,718 --> 00:37:12,649
We're going to play a wonderful game called
"Who is my daddy and what does he do?"

471
00:37:12,732 --> 00:37:15,578
- Yes?
- Is your daddy a fireman?

472
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:18,162
He's probably big.
Is he a wrestler?

473
00:37:18,246 --> 00:37:21,412
- Is he a basketball coach?
- No, no, no, no.

474
00:37:21,415 --> 00:37:23,042
What's the matter?

475
00:37:23,084 --> 00:37:24,502
I have a headache.

476
00:37:24,585 --> 00:37:27,895
- It might be a tumor.
- It's not a tumor!

477
00:37:27,922 --> 00:37:30,383
It's not a tumor at all.

478
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:36,991
What I meant was you tell me who is your daddy...

479
00:37:36,993 --> 00:37:39,584
- ...and what does he do?
- Oh.

480
00:37:40,427 --> 00:37:41,386
Get it?

481
00:37:41,469 --> 00:37:43,596
Okay. We start right here. You.

482
00:37:43,598 --> 00:37:48,268
My dad repairs wrecked cars
driven by women who are pinheads.

483
00:37:50,478 --> 00:37:55,817
My dad doesn't do anything since the crash.

484
00:37:55,900 --> 00:38:00,514
My dad gives money to people that doesn't have money,...

485
00:38:00,656 --> 00:38:06,653
...and then people use that money, and then they give
other money back and they give the same amount...

486
00:38:06,694 --> 00:38:08,788
...of money back to my dad.

487
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:14,741
My dad doesn't live with us anymore.
He lives in New York and drives a taxi.

488
00:38:14,919 --> 00:38:18,264
My mom hopes he's gonna die real soon.

489
00:38:22,177 --> 00:38:25,138
My dad watches TV all day long.

490
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:30,143
My dad works on computers,...

491
00:38:30,185 --> 00:38:35,148
...and he's, um, the boss of his company,...

492
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:39,352
...and, um, he has a mustache and a beard.

493
00:38:39,394 --> 00:38:41,753
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

494
00:38:42,697 --> 00:38:45,658
He doesn't have that much hair because...

495
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:50,622
...and he--
his head is so big that he can't wear any hats.

496
00:38:50,705 --> 00:38:52,665
My dad's divorced.

497
00:38:52,707 --> 00:38:54,918
My mom's divorced.

498
00:38:55,301 --> 00:39:01,273
My dad, um, is a psychologist,
and he helps people that are hurt or...

499
00:39:01,275 --> 00:39:04,886
...lost their feelings, and, um, that's it.

500
00:39:04,969 --> 00:39:10,433
Our mom says that our dad is a real sex machine.

501
00:39:15,355 --> 00:39:16,898
Good.

502
00:39:16,981 --> 00:39:19,901
I don't know what my dad does.

503
00:39:19,984 --> 00:39:22,862
I haven't seen him in a long time.

504
00:39:22,904 --> 00:39:24,489
He lives in France.

505
00:39:26,274 --> 00:39:29,064
My dad is a gynecologist,...

506
00:39:29,065 --> 00:39:33,565
...and he looks at vaginas all day long.

507
00:39:33,915 --> 00:39:37,669
Mi pap trabaja en la casa,...

508
00:39:37,752 --> 00:39:40,755
...y él juega conmigo mucho.

509
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:43,049
Thank you.
Very good.

510
00:39:43,091 --> 00:39:47,448
Okay. Next, uh--
What's his name with his back to me?

511
00:39:47,554 --> 00:39:51,588
His name's Zach Sullivan.
He doesn't like anyone to talk to him.

512
00:39:51,596 --> 00:39:54,396
- He's a poo-poo head.
- Yeah. He's a poo-poo face.

513
00:39:54,436 --> 00:39:59,163
- He's a ca-ca poo-poo.
- He's a poo-poo ca-ca.

514
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:02,110
- Poo-poo ca-ca!
- Poo-poo ca-ca!

515
00:40:02,193 --> 00:40:04,612
- Poo-poo ca-ca!
- Poo-poo ca-ca!

516
00:40:04,696 --> 00:40:05,613
Quiet.

517
00:40:05,697 --> 00:40:06,698
That's enough.

518
00:40:10,285 --> 00:40:14,761
Hey, Zach.
Did your daddy teach you this game?

519
00:40:16,624 --> 00:40:21,586
Come on, Zach. Let's all play together.
It's so much more fun.

520
00:40:21,629 --> 00:40:23,222
Leave me alone!

521
00:40:24,382 --> 00:40:25,700
What's that?

522
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,311
It's a fire alarm!

523
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:30,799
Come on, come on.

524
00:40:30,805 --> 00:40:32,440
Everyone together!
Come on.

525
00:40:32,443 --> 00:40:35,526
- I'm on fire!
- Come on. Stay all together!

526
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:37,003
- I'm on fire!
- Come on.

527
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:46,946
Very straight.
Very straight.

528
00:40:57,665 --> 00:41:00,210
Come on, come on.
Get all together.

529
00:41:00,293 --> 00:41:04,178
Everything together.
Come on. Come on. Quiet.

530
00:41:04,255 --> 00:41:08,173
Quiet! Come on.
Shh! Quiet.

531
00:41:08,176 --> 00:41:12,889
Well, we're all glad the kindergarten class could join us.

532
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:18,517
That's four minutes.
You should be ashamed of yourselves.

533
00:41:19,479 --> 00:41:23,910
All the other grades, your times were an improvement.

534
00:41:23,912 --> 00:41:26,528
But they're still not good enough.

535
00:41:26,569 --> 00:41:29,080
I'm very disappointed.

536
00:41:29,263 --> 00:41:32,617
All right, let's get back into school.

537
00:41:55,515 --> 00:42:01,283
Mrs. Sullivan! Mrs. Sullivan!

538
00:42:06,976 --> 00:42:12,806
So the doctor says it's a stomach flu.
I'm fine. And I can eat anything I want.

539
00:42:12,807 --> 00:42:14,225
Let's find a restaurant.

540
00:42:14,229 --> 00:42:15,927
Well, listen can we talk business for a minute?

541
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:18,329
- Yeah. Sure.
- There are 14 boys in the classroom.

542
00:42:18,413 --> 00:42:21,833
So far I have three possible suspects, one likely.

543
00:42:21,916 --> 00:42:23,752
Here are the picture.
Are you listening?

544
00:42:23,793 --> 00:42:25,128
- Yeah. I'm listening.
- Okay. Yeah.

545
00:42:25,211 --> 00:42:26,872
His name's Zach Sullivan.
What do you think?

546
00:42:26,875 --> 00:42:30,216
Yeah, he's cute.
Doesn't anybody eat around here?

547
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:33,136
Listen, he's a dead ringer for Crisp. Look.

548
00:42:34,429 --> 00:42:37,799
Maybe. Come on, John.
I'm hungry.

549
00:42:37,804 --> 00:42:40,460
Yes Mr. Chapman a table for two.
Thank you very much.

550
00:42:40,543 --> 00:42:43,071
- Two hot dogs.
- Two hot dogs?

551
00:42:43,076 --> 00:42:45,746
- Mr. Kimble! Mr. Kimble!
- Dominic.

552
00:42:45,748 --> 00:42:47,475
- It's him, Mom.
- Oh! Yes.

553
00:42:47,477 --> 00:42:50,877
- Joyce.
- Hello, Joyce.

554
00:42:50,944 --> 00:42:54,280
- Dominic is been such a great help. He's a good kid.
- Yeah.

555
00:42:54,288 --> 00:42:56,308
- Well, who's that?
- Dominic. - Who?

556
00:42:56,312 --> 00:42:57,577
Her.

557
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:02,790
- Oh, that? Uh, that is, uh--
- I am his sister.

558
00:43:02,832 --> 00:43:03,792
Oh, really?

559
00:43:03,793 --> 00:43:05,293
- Yeah.
- I would never have guessed.

560
00:43:05,335 --> 00:43:07,668
Oh! Yeah. Well.
Sometimes you have to excuse my brother.

561
00:43:07,677 --> 00:43:09,146
He has no manners at all.

562
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:11,549
My name is Ursula.
It's wonderful to meet you.

563
00:43:11,552 --> 00:43:13,093
I'm visiting here from Austria.

564
00:43:13,176 --> 00:43:16,137
I'm Joyce Paulmarie.
I work at John's school.

565
00:43:16,179 --> 00:43:18,280
- Ah.
- And this is Dominic.

566
00:43:18,281 --> 00:43:19,858
- Hello Dominic.
- Nice to meet you.

567
00:43:19,861 --> 00:43:23,361
- Ah! Very nice to meet you too.
- Would you like to join us for dinner?

568
00:43:23,364 --> 00:43:24,521
- No.
- Ja.

569
00:43:24,604 --> 00:43:25,730
Ja.

570
00:43:25,814 --> 00:43:28,566
Yes, of course.
That would be great.

571
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:31,528
Hi. There will be four of us.

572
00:43:31,611 --> 00:43:32,821
Table 27.

573
00:43:32,862 --> 00:43:38,532
- Why did you tell her you were my sister?
- Relax, butch. The love doctor is here.

574
00:43:39,536 --> 00:43:42,213
Come to me.
I want to start.

575
00:43:42,996 --> 00:43:48,543
Okay. I want a rib eye steak with mashed potatoes
and a large green salad.

576
00:43:48,628 --> 00:43:54,546
Oh, no. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I want to start with the spicy chicken wings.

577
00:43:54,584 --> 00:43:57,086
They are not the tiny-bitty ones
without meat on them, are they?

578
00:43:57,090 --> 00:43:59,188
Actually, it's quite a large serving.

579
00:43:59,192 --> 00:44:02,165
Ah, good.
Ooh, good arms.

580
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:06,020
And a large bowl of the clam chowder.

581
00:44:06,062 --> 00:44:10,150
Uh, has blue blueberry pie with ice cream for dessert.

582
00:44:10,233 --> 00:44:11,276
Ja.

583
00:44:12,902 --> 00:44:15,363
I like how they talk.

584
00:44:17,365 --> 00:44:22,370
So, I've been trying to get to know the parents,
but some of them are avoiding me.

585
00:44:22,412 --> 00:44:24,272
Well, some of the parents are like that.

586
00:44:24,273 --> 00:44:27,333
It's a strange town that way, especially with new arrivals.

587
00:44:27,417 --> 00:44:28,734
What do you mean?

588
00:44:28,738 --> 00:44:32,005
Well, I think a lot of people that come to small towns are...

589
00:44:32,088 --> 00:44:36,317
...trying to get away from something
or they're hiding something.

590
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:37,865
Like what?

591
00:44:38,261 --> 00:44:41,222
Well, for example, what brought you here?

592
00:44:41,264 --> 00:44:44,893
Me? Well, there was an opening for a kindergarten teacher.

593
00:44:44,934 --> 00:44:47,645
Yeah, but what made you become a kindergarten teacher?

594
00:44:47,729 --> 00:44:51,777
- I mean, it is a bit unusual.
- Well, but John is a bit unusual.

595
00:44:51,858 --> 00:44:55,276
- Well, I was born in Austria.
- You are.

596
00:44:55,278 --> 00:44:56,738
My father was a teacher.

597
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:58,356
My mother was a teacher.

598
00:44:58,359 --> 00:45:01,088
- So is Ursula.
- Ja.

599
00:45:01,097 --> 00:45:05,121
So, we have a tradition in Austria
where we follow the footsteps of our parents.

600
00:45:05,205 --> 00:45:09,117
So when I moved to this country,
I got the job teaching geography...

601
00:45:09,118 --> 00:45:13,128
...and physical education in Arizona,
and then I coached basketball...

602
00:45:13,129 --> 00:45:16,832
...at an all-girls school in Rhode Island, but...

603
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:20,095
...none of it made me really happy.

604
00:45:20,136 --> 00:45:25,263
- Why weren't you happy?
- Ja. Why weren't you happy?

605
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:31,297
Well, I got tired of teaching teenagers
because by the time they came to me,...

606
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:36,759
...I felt there wasn't much I could do with them.
I realized that the real action is in kindergarten.

607
00:45:37,654 --> 00:45:41,798
- How long have you been teaching kindergarten?
- It's my second day.

608
00:45:41,804 --> 00:45:42,951
Oh.

609
00:45:45,078 --> 00:45:50,540
Ooh, excuse me, but it's good.
It is good.

610
00:45:50,566 --> 00:45:53,826
- Thanks again. Have some fun.
- Nice to meet you.

611
00:45:53,833 --> 00:45:56,131
- Thank you.
- Bye.

612
00:45:56,172 --> 00:45:57,590
I had a great time.

613
00:45:57,674 --> 00:45:59,050
Ja, me, too.

614
00:45:59,134 --> 00:46:02,820
Well, Kimble, I think you scored.

615
00:46:05,348 --> 00:46:09,341
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you talking about?

616
00:46:09,343 --> 00:46:12,563
The only reason I'm only interested
in this women is because she works at the school.

617
00:46:12,646 --> 00:46:14,623
She knows the children and the parents.

618
00:46:14,626 --> 00:46:19,159
Kimble, if you were any stiffer, we could take
you surfing. Now, I know you like that woman.

619
00:46:19,165 --> 00:46:23,324
- What is your problem?
- The only problem I've got is that I'm doing your job.

620
00:46:23,366 --> 00:46:27,328
You should be cleaning up the paint. You should
be reading stories about bears that go shopping.

621
00:46:27,370 --> 00:46:30,739
- It is your job and I'm stuck with it.
- Yeah. You are.

622
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:32,459
That's right. I am.

623
00:46:32,542 --> 00:46:36,363
Look, you're going to be out of here in a few days.

624
00:46:36,366 --> 00:46:39,282
You told me yourself you had a few good leads.

625
00:46:39,286 --> 00:46:42,802
You gonna be back dealing with junkies
and murderers in no time.

626
00:46:54,064 --> 00:46:56,441
They're pushing me around.

627
00:46:56,524 --> 00:46:59,893
- Who?
- The kids.

628
00:47:00,695 --> 00:47:03,198
They're walking all over me.

629
00:47:09,913 --> 00:47:14,514
Listen, Kimble.
You got to handle this like any other police situation.

630
00:47:14,517 --> 00:47:18,088
You walk into it showing fear, you're dead,...

631
00:47:18,171 --> 00:47:20,965
...and those kids know you're scared.

632
00:47:25,762 --> 00:47:30,297
- No fear.
- No fear.

633
00:47:32,902 --> 00:47:38,880
Today we're going to play a new fun game.
It's called " police school."

634
00:47:38,888 --> 00:47:43,896
I'm going to be your sheriff.
You're going to be my deputy trainees.

635
00:47:45,448 --> 00:47:48,583
Come on. Stop whining.

636
00:47:49,953 --> 00:47:51,746
You kids are soft.

637
00:47:51,788 --> 00:47:53,998
You lack discipline.

638
00:47:54,958 --> 00:47:59,526
Well, I've got news for you.
You are mine now. You belong to me!

639
00:48:00,964 --> 00:48:04,125
You're not going to have your mommies stand
behind you anymore and wipe your little tushies.

640
00:48:04,167 --> 00:48:08,260
Oh, no. It's time now to turn this mush into muscles.

641
00:48:10,432 --> 00:48:14,181
No more complaining.
No more, "Mr. Kimble I have to go to the bathroom."

642
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:17,530
Nothing. There is no bathroom!

643
00:48:20,834 --> 00:48:26,832
Now, the first thing the deputy trainees have to learn
is to freeze whenever you hear this.

644
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:35,457
Now, the next time you hear this whistle,
each one of you get one toy.

645
00:48:35,498 --> 00:48:36,498
How many?

646
00:48:36,583 --> 00:48:41,192
- One!
- Good. Then bring it back to the carpet, pronto.

647
00:48:41,202 --> 00:48:46,503
Ready?
Wait for it. Wait for it.

648
00:48:46,593 --> 00:48:48,303
Sit down.

649
00:48:49,345 --> 00:48:50,847
Ready?

650
00:48:51,848 --> 00:48:55,986
Go quickly. Get your toy.
Go. Go for it.

651
00:48:56,019 --> 00:48:57,896
Yes. Very fast.

652
00:48:57,979 --> 00:49:03,664
Good. Quickly. Bring the toy back. Bring the
toy back to the carpet. Bring it back to the carpet.

653
00:49:03,693 --> 00:49:06,821
Quick, quick, quick.
Back to the carpet.

654
00:49:06,863 --> 00:49:08,114
Quickly.

655
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:12,160
Emma.

656
00:49:14,287 --> 00:49:17,599
Emma, take your toy back to the carpet.

657
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:21,419
I'm not a policeman.
I'm a princess.

658
00:49:21,503 --> 00:49:24,380
Take your toy back to the carpet.

659
00:49:25,256 --> 00:49:29,756
- I'm not a policeman! I'm a princess.
- Take it back!

660
00:49:30,595 --> 00:49:32,714
All right.

661
00:49:41,038 --> 00:49:46,948
Very good. You did very well.
Now we're going to play another game.

662
00:49:46,951 --> 00:49:49,213
When you hear two whistle blows,...

663
00:49:49,297 --> 00:49:53,901
...each one of you take your toy back where
you got it from and come right back to the carpet.

664
00:49:53,904 --> 00:49:55,111
How many whistle blows?

665
00:49:55,113 --> 00:49:56,679
- Two!
- Two!

666
00:49:56,721 --> 00:49:58,514
Good. Ready?

667
00:49:59,624 --> 00:50:00,709
Go.

668
00:50:00,792 --> 00:50:04,218
Come on.
Come right back to the carpet.

669
00:50:04,295 --> 00:50:09,714
Yes. It works. This is great.
Faster, faster. Come on.

670
00:50:09,724 --> 00:50:13,602
Yes. Come back. Terrific.
This is working. Wait. Wait.

671
00:50:13,638 --> 00:50:16,857
I mean, you're very good deputies.

672
00:50:18,268 --> 00:50:21,487
Your sheriff is proud of you.

673
00:50:28,987 --> 00:50:33,714
1, 2, 3, 4.
1, 2, 3, 4.

674
00:50:33,758 --> 00:50:37,938
1, 2, 3, 4.
1, 2, 3, 4.

675
00:50:41,583 --> 00:50:44,627
Wait! Take me.

676
00:50:44,669 --> 00:50:49,997
Down. Up. Down.
Yes, yes, yes! You've got it.

677
00:50:51,009 --> 00:50:53,611
Yes, Wanda. Good.

678
00:50:54,763 --> 00:50:59,467
Very good.
Big circles. Big circles. Good.

679
00:50:59,517 --> 00:51:01,811
Now do the same thing.
Way back.

680
00:51:01,853 --> 00:51:05,438
And down in big circles. Big circles.

681
00:51:15,166 --> 00:51:16,392
Yes.

682
00:51:24,858 --> 00:51:28,444
This is a fire drill!
This is a fire drill.

683
00:51:28,504 --> 00:51:29,763
Run to the door.

684
00:51:30,715 --> 00:51:32,884
Dominic, don't forget Ferret.

685
00:51:32,967 --> 00:51:36,719
Yes. It's a fire drill. Come on.

686
00:51:37,514 --> 00:51:42,074
Oh, this is terrible.
Come on. Come on.

687
00:51:43,478 --> 00:51:49,155
29. 30. 31.

688
00:51:49,234 --> 00:51:54,450
32. 33.
One more.

689
00:51:54,454 --> 00:51:58,376
Come on. Down and up.
Come on. Yes! Yes!

690
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:01,519
Zach is the winner. Clap your hands.
Come on, you guys.

691
00:52:08,503 --> 00:52:12,845
March, 2, 3, 4.
March, 2, 3, 4.

692
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:18,163
Swing your arms. 2, 3, 4.
Swing them high. 2, 3, 4.

693
00:52:18,266 --> 00:52:22,673
1, 2, 3, 4.
1, 2, 3, 4.

694
00:52:23,568 --> 00:52:26,987
- Wow.
- 1, 2, 3, 4!

695
00:52:27,071 --> 00:52:31,489
- Reading, writing, arithmetic.
- Reading, writing, arithmetic.

696
00:52:31,492 --> 00:52:36,113
- Too much homework makes me sick.
- Too much homework makes me sick.

697
00:52:36,117 --> 00:52:40,774
- When it's time to pass the test...
- When it's time to pass the test...

698
00:52:40,787 --> 00:52:45,231
- ...kindergarten is the best.
- ...kindergarten is the best.

699
00:52:45,234 --> 00:52:47,383
Yay!

700
00:52:47,425 --> 00:52:50,428
? E-l-E-l-O ?

701
00:52:50,511 --> 00:52:55,183
? And on that farm he had a duck ?

702
00:52:55,266 --> 00:52:58,227
? E-l-E-l-O ??

703
00:53:01,639 --> 00:53:03,641
All right.
Take your milk.

704
00:53:03,725 --> 00:53:06,227
It makes you big and strong.

705
00:53:10,148 --> 00:53:13,608
- It's story time, Mr. Kimble.
- All right.

706
00:53:13,650 --> 00:53:19,031
We all like this one, and if you read us a story now,
everybody will go to sleep.

707
00:53:19,015 --> 00:53:20,174
All right.

708
00:53:30,585 --> 00:53:33,004
I used to read this to my son.

709
00:53:33,088 --> 00:53:34,172
What's his name?

710
00:53:34,255 --> 00:53:37,131
- Who?
- Your son.

711
00:53:37,133 --> 00:53:41,343
- Oh, Alex is his name.
- Where is he?

712
00:53:41,546 --> 00:53:43,564
He lives with his mother.

713
00:53:50,855 --> 00:53:56,542
- You see, his mother and I, we are--
- Divorced. I know.

714
00:53:56,544 --> 00:53:57,937
What's a divorce?

715
00:53:57,941 --> 00:54:02,917
It's when your daddy has to live someplace else
and comes over to take you places,...

716
00:54:02,921 --> 00:54:05,528
...and your mommy says he's a deadbeat.

717
00:54:05,570 --> 00:54:09,924
No. It's when the daddy doesn't
want to see his little boy anymore.

718
00:54:09,928 --> 00:54:13,957
- That's not what it is.
- Why don't you want to see your little boy?

719
00:54:13,962 --> 00:54:17,963
- Was he bad?
- No, he was not bad.

720
00:54:18,883 --> 00:54:22,137
It wasn't his fault at all.

721
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:26,641
You see his mommy and I, we just nev--

722
00:54:35,191 --> 00:54:37,468
Just sit down, okay?

723
00:54:38,403 --> 00:54:42,446
Let me just start reading.
Okay. Why don't you all lie down?

724
00:54:42,532 --> 00:54:43,791
Okay.

725
00:54:44,743 --> 00:54:46,586
Good. And rest.

726
00:54:49,497 --> 00:54:53,117
"If you were a bird and lived on high...

727
00:54:53,121 --> 00:54:56,963
...you'd lean on the wind when the wind came by.

728
00:54:57,047 --> 00:55:03,043
You'd say to the wind when it took you away,
that's where I wanted to go today.

729
00:55:03,762 --> 00:55:07,766
Where am I going?
I don't quite know.

730
00:55:07,849 --> 00:55:11,061
What does it matter where people go?

731
00:55:11,102 --> 00:55:14,731
Down to the wood where the bluebells grow.

732
00:55:14,773 --> 00:55:16,149
Anywhere.

733
00:55:16,232 --> 00:55:17,901
Anywhere.

734
00:55:17,942 --> 00:55:19,486
I don't know."

735
00:55:58,483 --> 00:56:00,034
Huh!

736
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:06,487
- Hi.
- Hi.

737
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:13,039
I didn't mean to startle you.

738
00:56:16,668 --> 00:56:19,462
I must have dozed off.

739
00:56:19,504 --> 00:56:22,507
I can't believe you got them all to sleep.

740
00:56:23,675 --> 00:56:25,776
I worked them hard.

741
00:56:26,970 --> 00:56:32,892
I was wondering if you'd like to come
to my place for dinner tomorrow night.

742
00:56:34,185 --> 00:56:36,438
I would like that.

743
00:56:36,521 --> 00:56:38,106
Yes.

744
00:56:38,189 --> 00:56:41,290
Great.
Well, here are the directions.

745
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:43,486
How about 6:30, 7:00?

746
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:45,780
That would be fine.

747
00:56:52,086 --> 00:56:55,287
- What?
- Um--

748
00:56:56,674 --> 00:57:02,644
- You--You've got a little mustache.
- Oh, it must be from the milk.

749
00:57:08,053 --> 00:57:11,497
Well, I'd better get back to class.

750
00:57:13,058 --> 00:57:15,018
I'll see you tomorrow.

751
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:16,644
See you tomorrow.

752
00:58:12,158 --> 00:58:14,818
- Freeze!
- No!

753
00:58:16,246 --> 00:58:17,914
No.

754
00:58:17,997 --> 00:58:22,593
This is Henry Shoop, my fiancé.

755
00:58:23,753 --> 00:58:25,138
Hi.

756
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:28,940
- Your fiancé?
- Yeah, my fiancé.

757
00:58:28,947 --> 00:58:34,437
- Henry, this is obviously my partner, John Kimble.
- Oh, jeez.

758
00:58:34,489 --> 00:58:36,107
Uh--

759
00:58:35,890 --> 00:58:37,308
- Hi.
- How you doing?

760
00:58:37,314 --> 00:58:39,929
I'm here, just get this now.
I'll be right out.

761
00:58:39,930 --> 00:58:43,280
Yeah. Oh!
It's okay, honey.

762
00:58:43,356 --> 00:58:44,816
Okay. I'll be right out.

763
00:58:44,899 --> 00:58:47,876
- It's my birthday.
- Well, congratulations.

764
00:58:47,886 --> 00:58:50,755
Thanks.
He came all the way up here just to surprise me.

765
00:58:50,759 --> 00:58:54,959
And he made me my favorite--
pasta a olio.

766
00:58:59,914 --> 00:59:03,925
I love you, Henry.
I love you, too, Phoebes.

767
00:59:03,933 --> 00:59:07,889
Uh-- Well, I've got to head back tonight.
I've got to work.

768
00:59:07,922 --> 00:59:10,847
- Henry's a chef.
- I'm a chef.

769
00:59:10,925 --> 00:59:12,343
You're marrying a chef?

770
00:59:12,427 --> 00:59:15,395
- I'm marrying a great chef.
- That figures.

771
00:59:15,430 --> 00:59:18,082
You mean that, a great chef?

772
00:59:18,066 --> 00:59:19,942
Of course. I mean it.
You're a genius, Henry.

773
00:59:19,946 --> 00:59:22,803
- Not just a good chef?
- Well, listen, it was nice to meet you.

774
00:59:22,806 --> 00:59:24,697
Congratulations.
Happy birthday.

775
00:59:24,699 --> 00:59:27,749
Thanks. You want some?
You want some all of them?

776
00:59:27,751 --> 00:59:29,027
- You really? You know--
- You're the best.

777
00:59:29,110 --> 00:59:31,445
- It wasn't a little overcooked?
- No. Al dente.

778
00:59:41,964 --> 00:59:43,107
Zach.

779
00:59:45,968 --> 00:59:48,970
Excuse me. I'm John Kimble, I'm Zach's teacher.

780
00:59:48,971 --> 00:59:52,133
I didn't know he was following me.

781
00:59:52,134 --> 00:59:55,636
Hi. I've been leaving messages on your machine.

782
00:59:55,637 --> 00:59:57,638
I'm sorry.
Things been kind of hectic.

783
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:59,440
What about now?

784
00:59:59,482 --> 01:00:01,359
Uh--

785
01:00:02,485 --> 01:00:06,678
Go for a little walk Zach.
Your teacher and I have to talk for a minute. Okay.

786
01:00:15,790 --> 01:00:17,000
Uh--

787
01:00:17,083 --> 01:00:19,711
I know what this is about.

788
01:00:23,464 --> 01:00:27,885
I suppose you saw the bruises on Zach's legs?

789
01:00:30,304 --> 01:00:35,457
My husband has started counseling about this.
He's been going for three weeks now.

790
01:00:35,477 --> 01:00:40,281
Please don't bring the school system into it.
It will only make matters worse.

791
01:00:40,315 --> 01:00:42,191
He's beating you, too?

792
01:00:43,985 --> 01:00:48,549
I mean, if he wasn't going to the counseling,
I could see the point of saying something,...

793
01:00:48,550 --> 01:00:52,410
...but I'm sure there can't be anymore occurrences.

794
01:00:52,494 --> 01:00:55,338
You won't say anything, will you?

795
01:00:56,706 --> 01:00:58,458
Please?

796
01:01:00,001 --> 01:01:04,180
If he does it again, I press charges.

797
01:01:15,517 --> 01:01:17,368
Zach.

798
01:01:35,370 --> 01:01:40,530
You got the stuff?
Thanks, man.

799
01:01:48,008 --> 01:01:53,569
Here, lady. I gave her your stuff.
Now, where's the rest of my money?

800
01:01:54,848 --> 01:01:56,933
Who are you, old lady?

801
01:01:57,017 --> 01:01:59,294
Your fairy godmother.

802
01:02:03,190 --> 01:02:04,107
Come in.

803
01:02:04,191 --> 01:02:09,345
Hi. Well, it took me all day,
but I found out Zach Sullivan and his mother...

804
01:02:09,349 --> 01:02:11,823
...aren't related to Crisp.
I know. I just found out.

805
01:02:11,907 --> 01:02:16,052
Oh, man. I got a bottle of wine for your big date--

806
01:02:16,056 --> 01:02:19,888
Oh, it's not a date. It's not a date, I know.
But we want Joyce should to think that. Do we?

807
01:02:19,915 --> 01:02:22,709
- Thanks. I don't think it's a good idea.
- Why not?

808
01:02:22,751 --> 01:02:28,423
Quickest way to slip up doing undercover work
is just by doing things that you normally wouldn't do.

809
01:02:28,465 --> 01:02:30,425
Wait a minute.

810
01:02:30,426 --> 01:02:36,320
Do you mean to tell me that you wouldn't take a bottle
of wine to a woman who's invited you over for dinner?

811
01:02:36,322 --> 01:02:41,032
Of course you would. You know you would.
And flowers as well. Here you go.

812
01:02:41,228 --> 01:02:43,062
She'll love them.

813
01:02:59,111 --> 01:03:00,947
Well, here we are.

814
01:03:00,988 --> 01:03:03,749
Wow. This is quite a place.

815
01:03:03,791 --> 01:03:07,662
They must be paying you
a lot more than they're paying me.

816
01:03:07,664 --> 01:03:10,122
Well, I wish it was my house.

817
01:03:10,164 --> 01:03:12,359
It belongs to a friend of mine.

818
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:17,840
After the divorce, he said Dominic and I can stay here
in exchange for keeping the place up.

819
01:03:17,882 --> 01:03:21,002
- You must have nice friends.
- Yes, I do.

820
01:03:22,009 --> 01:03:26,771
Dinner won't be ready for a few minutes.
Can you start a fire?

821
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:32,175
- I don't think it should be a problem.
- Yeah. I'll show you where the wood is.

822
01:03:33,688 --> 01:03:35,189
Come on. Come on!

823
01:03:37,525 --> 01:03:38,651
Right here.

824
01:03:45,241 --> 01:03:46,325
In here.

825
01:03:47,535 --> 01:03:50,121
This is my secret hiding spot.

826
01:03:50,204 --> 01:03:54,632
- Wow. This is amazing.
- I made it myself.

827
01:03:54,709 --> 01:03:57,226
- What's this?
- Don't touch that!

828
01:03:57,231 --> 01:04:00,112
It's a laser,
and it'll burn a hole right through you.

829
01:04:00,116 --> 01:04:01,367
Okay. I'll be careful.

830
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:03,202
Oh, don't shoot.

831
01:04:03,205 --> 01:04:05,204
- Boom! Boom!
- Don't shoot.

832
01:04:06,387 --> 01:04:09,974
I put up these lasers to protect us.

833
01:04:12,727 --> 01:04:14,645
To protect you from what?

834
01:04:14,729 --> 01:04:16,355
The bad people.

835
01:04:16,397 --> 01:04:19,650
Do you want to see something else?

836
01:04:21,694 --> 01:04:22,945
Come on.

837
01:04:23,905 --> 01:04:25,031
What?

838
01:04:25,114 --> 01:04:26,824
See that?

839
01:04:27,909 --> 01:04:29,535
You mean the tower?

840
01:04:29,619 --> 01:04:33,881
I'm going to plant one of my lasers on that antenna.

841
01:04:33,883 --> 01:04:36,626
But I'll have to do it at night.

842
01:04:36,709 --> 01:04:40,171
Otherwise the bad people will know where it is.

843
01:04:42,715 --> 01:04:47,577
- Last one to the table is a rotten banana!
- Hey honey you guys had fun?

844
01:04:47,581 --> 01:04:49,422
- Yeah.
- Be right out!

845
01:05:46,153 --> 01:05:50,681
- What you doing in there?
- I'm lost.

846
01:05:50,690 --> 01:05:54,150
Where is the dining room?
I mean, this house is huge.

847
01:05:54,245 --> 01:05:58,958
- Follow me, silly.
- Whew.

848
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,003
These are beautiful pictures of you and Dominic.

849
01:06:02,044 --> 01:06:03,087
Thank you.

850
01:06:05,006 --> 01:06:09,369
When I was putting Dominic to bed,
he mentioned you had a son, too.

851
01:06:09,371 --> 01:06:12,405
That's right.
But I'm divorced.

852
01:06:12,406 --> 01:06:16,475
I'm very lucky because
my ex got remarried to a very nice man.

853
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:20,690
He's really good to my son.
I get to see a lot of him.

854
01:06:20,771 --> 01:06:25,200
What about your ex-husband?
Does he see Dominic often?

855
01:06:25,234 --> 01:06:29,197
Uh, no. After the divorce, he moved back to France.

856
01:06:30,573 --> 01:06:35,750
What about child support and alimony?
I mean does he take care of you?

857
01:06:36,871 --> 01:06:39,332
I'm sorry about being so personal.

858
01:06:43,044 --> 01:06:48,181
I was so glad to see him going,
I didn't worry about that part.

859
01:06:48,216 --> 01:06:51,857
Dominic doesn't even remember him.
I prefer it that way.

860
01:06:51,886 --> 01:06:53,846
Are you sure?

861
01:06:55,223 --> 01:06:56,424
Yeah.

862
01:06:57,558 --> 01:06:58,893
Why?

863
01:06:58,935 --> 01:07:02,398
Well, Dominic was talking to me about...

864
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:07,193
...having to move around a lot
to keep the bad people away.

865
01:07:08,569 --> 01:07:09,817
Bad people?

866
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:14,810
Yeah. Something about that he have to leave in the
middle of the night and leave his toys behind.

867
01:07:16,812 --> 01:07:18,914
Oh, God.

868
01:07:19,697 --> 01:07:22,717
I thought he'd forgotten about that.

869
01:07:24,461 --> 01:07:27,502
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you.

870
01:07:27,505 --> 01:07:29,507
It's not your fault.

871
01:07:29,590 --> 01:07:33,511
The truth is, my ex-husband is a walking nightmare.

872
01:07:33,594 --> 01:07:37,014
He didn't leave us, we left him.

873
01:07:37,098 --> 01:07:41,919
He found out where we were and tried to kidnap Dominic.

874
01:07:41,922 --> 01:07:47,833
He doesn't know where we are now,
and I'd like to keep it that way.

875
01:07:48,985 --> 01:07:50,403
Of course.

876
01:07:50,444 --> 01:07:54,407
I'm glad he's in France and doesn't live nearby.

877
01:08:00,121 --> 01:08:02,123
He doesn't live in France.

878
01:08:05,126 --> 01:08:09,296
I told Dominic that he lived in France.

879
01:08:10,047 --> 01:08:14,594
I didn't know who my ex-husband was when I married him.

880
01:08:14,677 --> 01:08:19,473
I was young and stupid, and I made a mistake.

881
01:08:21,684 --> 01:08:24,645
I don't want Dominic to pay for it.

882
01:08:29,901 --> 01:08:32,945
Look, nobody around here knows anything about this.

883
01:08:33,029 --> 01:08:36,616
I can't even believe I told you.

884
01:08:39,994 --> 01:08:43,247
You have to promise me you won't tell anyone.

885
01:08:46,042 --> 01:08:47,960
You can trust me.

886
01:08:52,506 --> 01:08:56,766
That's very good. Perfect.
All right. Let's try it again.

887
01:08:56,793 --> 01:08:58,679
Mary, you first.

888
01:08:58,763 --> 01:09:02,850
Fourscores and seven years ago.

889
01:09:02,934 --> 01:09:06,354
Fourscores and seven years ago.

890
01:09:06,395 --> 01:09:11,150
Our forefathers brought--
Four fathers brought?

891
01:09:11,192 --> 01:09:14,445
Mr. Kimble, did Lincoln have four fathers?

892
01:09:14,529 --> 01:09:17,330
- Uh--
- I had three fathers--

893
01:09:17,336 --> 01:09:19,525
One named Walt, two named Ralph.

894
01:09:22,370 --> 01:09:24,622
Did Lincoln have four mothers?

895
01:09:24,705 --> 01:09:29,625
As a matter of fact, he had two mothers.
Unfortunately, the first one died.

896
01:09:29,710 --> 01:09:31,245
I knew it.

897
01:09:35,383 --> 01:09:39,509
Um-- Okay.
Let's take a break. Come on.

898
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:43,474
I want you to walk around in a circle. Go.

899
01:09:44,392 --> 01:09:45,726
Start. Come on.

900
01:09:48,563 --> 01:09:51,524
Well, Joyce's story about the house checked out.

901
01:09:51,566 --> 01:09:56,427
It belongs to a guy in San Diego who only uses it
for two weeks during the ski season.

902
01:09:56,430 --> 01:09:59,536
She's got under $1,000 in the bank,
no safety deposit box,...

903
01:09:59,537 --> 01:10:03,437
...no stocks, no bonds, no other assets
under the name Joyce Paulmarie.

904
01:10:03,438 --> 01:10:06,973
Her teacher's salary is less than what I made,
which is pathetic.

905
01:10:06,975 --> 01:10:10,619
Keep looking.
Check for offshore accounts on Dominic's name--

906
01:10:10,622 --> 01:10:16,122
She doesn't live like a women with millions of dollars.
She doesn't even seem the type.

907
01:10:16,599 --> 01:10:19,010
Kimble, this might not be her.

908
01:10:19,093 --> 01:10:20,386
It's got to be her.

909
01:10:20,428 --> 01:10:24,929
Why? Because she doesn't want to have
anything to do with her ex-husband?

910
01:10:24,930 --> 01:10:26,779
I know it's her.

911
01:10:26,809 --> 01:10:30,530
Know what I think?
I think you want it to be her.

912
01:10:30,531 --> 01:10:33,774
You really like her, and it's scaring you to death.

913
01:10:34,859 --> 01:10:37,574
Excuse me! Surprise!

914
01:10:37,653 --> 01:10:40,746
Ladies! Ladies, surprise.

915
01:10:40,649 --> 01:10:45,354
Obviously, I'm not into baking cakes,
so I brought these little things...

916
01:10:45,357 --> 01:10:47,290
...to donate for the raffle prizes.

917
01:10:49,373 --> 01:10:52,076
- Who the hell is that?
- So.

918
01:10:52,059 --> 01:10:54,921
Well, she's the one I was telling you about.

919
01:10:54,962 --> 01:10:58,466
Her husband ran away with another guy.

920
01:10:58,549 --> 01:11:00,593
It's been terrible for her.

921
01:11:05,473 --> 01:11:08,267
You're not getting mellow on me, are you?

922
01:11:08,309 --> 01:11:09,268
3, 4.

923
01:11:09,310 --> 01:11:10,770
- Hi.
- 1, 2, 3--

924
01:11:10,811 --> 01:11:11,771
Hi.

925
01:11:11,812 --> 01:11:15,983
Come on. 1, 2, 3, 4.
Come on. Go, go.

926
01:11:16,067 --> 01:11:20,404
I see they stuck you with the
whole Gettysburg Address this year.

927
01:11:20,488 --> 01:11:22,114
They sure did.

928
01:11:23,157 --> 01:11:24,659
Company, halt!

929
01:11:30,581 --> 01:11:31,624
Um--

930
01:11:32,667 --> 01:11:34,293
About last night--

931
01:11:34,377 --> 01:11:38,372
I've been thinking about it, and...

932
01:11:39,006 --> 01:11:43,381
- ...I'm glad I told you all those things.
- Also am I.

933
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:48,516
Um-- I-I better get going.

934
01:11:48,558 --> 01:11:51,143
Yeah. I have to get going, too.

935
01:11:54,522 --> 01:11:56,148
Is everything okay?

936
01:11:56,232 --> 01:11:57,316
Yeah.

937
01:11:58,693 --> 01:12:01,028
See you tomorrow at the fair.

938
01:12:01,112 --> 01:12:03,364
I'm looking forward to it.

939
01:12:07,410 --> 01:12:09,328
What are you looking at?

940
01:12:09,370 --> 01:12:10,371
Ha ha ha!

941
01:12:10,413 --> 01:12:11,455
Shh!

942
01:12:12,874 --> 01:12:15,509
March! 1, 2, 3, 4.

943
01:12:15,692 --> 01:12:19,547
I was just talking to the teacher, that's all.

944
01:12:19,589 --> 01:12:22,174
Yeah. Don't laugh.

945
01:12:23,467 --> 01:12:26,204
Okay. I'm proud of you.
Keep going.

946
01:12:26,207 --> 01:12:29,348
I'm sorry Zach's late.
The car wouldn't start.

947
01:12:29,350 --> 01:12:32,309
You be a good boy.
I love you.

948
01:12:34,395 --> 01:12:35,521
Hi, champ.

949
01:12:35,605 --> 01:12:37,023
Oh!

950
01:12:37,064 --> 01:12:38,599
What's the matter?

951
01:12:42,486 --> 01:12:43,529
Oh, no.

952
01:12:43,571 --> 01:12:45,406
I fell down again.

953
01:12:49,076 --> 01:12:50,536
Hey, wait a minute.

954
01:12:52,079 --> 01:12:53,372
Uh--

955
01:12:53,414 --> 01:12:57,353
I forgot to close the door to the basement,
and Zach had a bad fall.

956
01:12:57,354 --> 01:12:59,654
The doctor says, it was much worse than he really is.

957
01:12:59,657 --> 01:13:02,206
You sure you all say the same thing,
"The kid fell down the steps."

958
01:13:02,210 --> 01:13:08,143
- Don't you have anything better to say than that?
- It's true. Look, I don't have to justify myself to you!

959
01:13:08,262 --> 01:13:10,390
You don't have any right talking to me like that.

960
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:14,602
Hey, how are you doing?

961
01:13:14,644 --> 01:13:17,241
You must be the Mr. Kimble we hear so much about.

962
01:13:17,943 --> 01:13:21,199
- You hit the kid, I hit you.
- You bastard!

963
01:13:31,869 --> 01:13:33,329
You're not worth it.

964
01:13:33,371 --> 01:13:36,290
I'm pressing charges against you.

965
01:13:37,959 --> 01:13:39,919
Excuse me, everybody.

966
01:13:45,633 --> 01:13:51,605
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have hit the man,
especially in front of the children. It was a mistake.

967
01:13:57,395 --> 01:13:58,813
I checked you out.

968
01:13:58,896 --> 01:14:04,816
There is no record of you ever having taught at
any public school, in California or anywhere else.

969
01:14:05,903 --> 01:14:11,851
Mr. Kimble,
you have no teaching experience whatsoever, do you?

970
01:14:13,035 --> 01:14:14,745
Someone finally noticed.

971
01:14:14,829 --> 01:14:20,558
I thought the introduction of a ferret was a horrible idea,
but the children seemed to like it.

972
01:14:20,852 --> 01:14:24,797
I thought the use of your police
whistle was outrageous but--

973
01:14:24,881 --> 01:14:29,149
- That's all I could think of.
- Please allow me to finish.

974
01:14:29,218 --> 01:14:33,147
- Sorry.
- But it worked.

975
01:14:34,530 --> 01:14:39,520
I have no idea what kind of police officer you are,...

976
01:14:39,528 --> 01:14:44,358
...but you're a very good teacher.

977
01:14:48,279 --> 01:14:49,697
Thank you.

978
01:14:51,449 --> 01:14:55,786
Now, will you tell me something?
Don't lie.

979
01:14:55,870 --> 01:15:01,450
What did it feel like to hit that son of a bitch?

980
01:15:06,047 --> 01:15:08,341
It felt great.

981
01:15:09,759 --> 01:15:10,927
Yeah.

982
01:15:12,762 --> 01:15:17,681
Well, tomorrow morning.
Bright and early.

983
01:15:17,767 --> 01:15:19,143
Thank you.

984
01:15:19,227 --> 01:15:20,186
Yeah.

985
01:15:30,821 --> 01:15:35,523
Yeah, that's her.
And there goes our goddamn case.

986
01:15:35,543 --> 01:15:39,880
Tell O'Hara and Kimble their witness is dead,
so Crisp is going to walk.

987
01:15:39,884 --> 01:15:44,057
We want their asses back here.
We've got lots of other cases to clear.

988
01:15:44,126 --> 01:15:47,637
- O'Hara says they think they've located the wife.
- Located the money?

989
01:15:47,642 --> 01:15:49,849
- She said they're looking into it.
- Oh. Bullshit.

990
01:15:49,852 --> 01:15:53,304
Have them tell the wife we're letting Crisp go,
and he knows where she is.

991
01:15:53,346 --> 01:15:55,907
If she wants police protection,
she better come up with the money.

992
01:15:55,908 --> 01:15:57,408
Yes sir.

993
01:15:57,849 --> 01:16:01,309
- I'm sorry it took so long, Cullen.
- Hey, you're looking great.

994
01:16:08,359 --> 01:16:09,819
I love you, Mother.

995
01:16:09,861 --> 01:16:12,738
We're going to be a family again, son.

996
01:16:41,225 --> 01:16:42,668
Go!

997
01:17:09,545 --> 01:17:12,878
Fourscore and seven years ago...

998
01:17:12,882 --> 01:17:16,594
Fourscore and seven years ago...

999
01:17:16,677 --> 01:17:20,640
...our forefathers brought forth on this continent...

1000
01:17:20,723 --> 01:17:25,077
...our forefathers brought forth on this continent...

1001
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:28,389
- ...a new nation...
- ...a new nation...

1002
01:17:28,397 --> 01:17:33,111
- ...conceived in liberty...
- ...conceived in liberty...

1003
01:17:33,194 --> 01:17:39,188
- ...and dedicated to the proposition...
- ...and dedicated to the proposition...

1004
01:17:39,190 --> 01:17:42,078
...that all men are created equal...

1005
01:17:42,119 --> 01:17:45,414
...that all men are created equal...

1006
01:17:45,456 --> 01:17:49,516
- ...and that government...
- ...and that government...

1007
01:17:49,585 --> 01:17:51,895
- ...of the people...
- ...by the people...

1008
01:17:51,963 --> 01:17:56,806
- ...and for the people...
- ...shall not perish from this earth.

1009
01:17:58,636 --> 01:18:00,596
Thank you very much.

1010
01:18:17,546 --> 01:18:23,510
Oh!
I'd like to introduce you to our kindergarten teacher.

1011
01:18:23,506 --> 01:18:26,758
He came to us as a substitute teacher,...

1012
01:18:26,759 --> 01:18:30,559
...and he's proven to be a wonderful asset.

1013
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:33,637
Let's welcome him into our community...

1014
01:18:33,661 --> 01:18:37,341
...and hope that he considers staying on a permanent basis.

1015
01:18:37,425 --> 01:18:42,719
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. John Kimble.

1016
01:19:18,216 --> 01:19:21,052
Nice town. Hmm.

1017
01:19:23,137 --> 01:19:25,473
Ahh! Smell that fresh air.

1018
01:19:25,556 --> 01:19:28,759
We should think about buying something up here,...

1019
01:19:28,763 --> 01:19:32,563
...like some log cabin in the woods near a lake.

1020
01:19:32,647 --> 01:19:37,448
- Kids love that outdoor kind of stuff.
- I'll be in the pharmacy, Cullen.

1021
01:19:37,527 --> 01:19:40,071
Try not to step in anything.

1022
01:19:54,919 --> 01:20:00,002
Yeah. I'd really like to help you. I think,
we're pretty much out of the race cars, unless-- Yeah.

1023
01:20:00,091 --> 01:20:01,884
This is the last one.

1024
01:20:02,926 --> 01:20:08,186
It's still in great shape. If you don't mind waiting,
I'll just wrap it up for you. I'll knock 10% off the price.

1025
01:20:08,192 --> 01:20:13,051
Excuse me. This is your lucky day. I have a better idea.
I'll pay you twice what he's charging.

1026
01:20:13,896 --> 01:20:16,899
I promised my boy I'd get him one of these.

1027
01:20:16,941 --> 01:20:21,753
Yeah. I'd love to help you, but my kid's been
bugging me of one this ever since Christmas. I'm sorry.

1028
01:20:21,757 --> 01:20:25,490
I'll pay you four times what it's worth.
You can get your kid something even better.

1029
01:20:25,499 --> 01:20:28,828
Sorry.
Hey listen, can you gift-wrap it his birthday?

1030
01:20:28,911 --> 01:20:32,430
- Hanna, could you wrap that, please?
- I'm trying. No harm in trying.

1031
01:20:34,292 --> 01:20:35,693
Tourists.

1032
01:20:41,757 --> 01:20:45,849
Great, Dominic. You're doing well.
I'll wait right over here for you, okay?

1033
01:20:45,888 --> 01:20:47,130
Okay.

1034
01:20:55,771 --> 01:20:59,366
- Great day, huh?
- We've run out of time.

1035
01:20:59,442 --> 01:21:01,736
We've got to press Joyce.
And we got to press her now.

1036
01:21:01,819 --> 01:21:03,362
What do you mean?

1037
01:21:03,446 --> 01:21:05,665
- Cindy O.D.'d last night.
- Shit.

1038
01:21:05,668 --> 01:21:08,667
Yeah. They released Crisp this morning.
He's probably on his way here now.

1039
01:21:08,668 --> 01:21:10,168
- No.
- And even better.

1040
01:21:10,172 --> 01:21:15,374
Salazar told me, I had to tell you this,
if Joyce is Crisp's wife, she's got to cooperate and tell us...

1041
01:21:15,458 --> 01:21:18,777
...about the money, or she gets no police protection.
Nice, huh?

1042
01:21:18,771 --> 01:21:19,978
Bastard.

1043
01:21:19,982 --> 01:21:22,957
Ursula, how are you?

1044
01:21:26,177 --> 01:21:27,261
What?

1045
01:21:30,431 --> 01:21:33,309
Listen, I got to tell you the truth.

1046
01:21:33,351 --> 01:21:37,795
Her name's not Ursula.
She's not my sister.

1047
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:42,317
- I beg your pardon?
- We're not who you think we are.

1048
01:21:42,401 --> 01:21:44,703
What is this?

1049
01:21:45,696 --> 01:21:48,657
We're police officers.

1050
01:21:50,743 --> 01:21:56,195
- We know who you are Rachel.
- This is some kinda joke, right?

1051
01:21:56,196 --> 01:21:57,625
No. This is no joke.

1052
01:21:57,708 --> 01:21:59,085
- You took $3 million.
- No.

1053
01:21:59,168 --> 01:22:01,376
- I think--
- Listen, Crisp knows where you are.

1054
01:22:01,384 --> 01:22:05,598
- He could be here any minute.
- Where's Dominic?

1055
01:22:05,675 --> 01:22:10,396
We can offer you immunity for your testimony,
you won't go to the jail, but we need you to help us.

1056
01:22:10,399 --> 01:22:12,697
- Where's Dominic?
- He is in the pony. He is fine.

1057
01:22:12,723 --> 01:22:15,518
Maybe we can offer you protection
if you tell us where the money is.

1058
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:19,246
There's no money, you son of a bitch.
There never was!

1059
01:22:20,731 --> 01:22:24,583
No, it's not fair!
I'm not finished yet!

1060
01:22:24,588 --> 01:22:27,457
The bad people have found us again.
Please do as I say.

1061
01:22:27,458 --> 01:22:29,058
Let's talk about this. What do you mean, " no money"?

1062
01:22:29,065 --> 01:22:31,785
- Why are you mad at Mr. Kimble?
- Because he's a jerk.

1063
01:22:31,788 --> 01:22:34,653
- Listen, please help me.
- Leave me alone!

1064
01:22:37,582 --> 01:22:39,125
Joyce, wait!

1065
01:22:39,208 --> 01:22:43,567
Wait! If you didn't take the money,
then why is he after you?

1066
01:22:43,573 --> 01:22:46,016
He doesn't want me.
He wants Dominic.

1067
01:22:53,306 --> 01:22:56,924
- She's going to run again.
- Yeah.

1068
01:22:56,965 --> 01:23:01,946
- Unless we do something about it.
- Yeah.

1069
01:23:01,996 --> 01:23:05,351
Hey, snap out of it!

1070
01:23:10,948 --> 01:23:16,078
Daryl. Daryl. I'm sorry.
I wanted to give you a second chance.

1071
01:23:16,162 --> 01:23:17,330
200, cash.

1072
01:23:17,413 --> 01:23:23,405
- What is wrong with you Mr?
- I'm still not getting through to you, am I, Daryl?

1073
01:23:31,010 --> 01:23:34,230
Mother, got this great surprise for Junior.

1074
01:23:34,231 --> 01:23:38,190
- That'll be 57.90.
- 57.90.

1075
01:23:38,195 --> 01:23:44,187
Children's aspirin, children's decongestant,
antihistamine.

1076
01:23:46,484 --> 01:23:48,068
A thermometer?

1077
01:23:48,072 --> 01:23:51,230
There is a lot of flu going around this time of year,
isn't it sir?

1078
01:23:51,233 --> 01:23:52,706
It is the season.

1079
01:23:52,710 --> 01:23:55,950
- The boy's not sick.
- Doesn't hurt to take precautions.

1080
01:23:55,993 --> 01:23:59,413
Mother, you are going to make him sick.

1081
01:23:59,497 --> 01:24:04,309
You stuffed all this crap down in my throat for years,
and there was nothing wrong with me.

1082
01:24:03,793 --> 01:24:07,755
That's why there was nothing wrong with you.

1083
01:24:09,382 --> 01:24:13,344
Now, how can you argue with that?

1084
01:24:25,231 --> 01:24:26,674
Joyce!

1085
01:24:32,822 --> 01:24:34,782
Joyce! Dominic!

1086
01:24:53,426 --> 01:24:57,144
- You bastard! Where's Dominic?
- I don't know. What happened?

1087
01:24:57,188 --> 01:25:00,349
No. You led him towards here.
If he has Dominic, I'll kill you.

1088
01:25:00,391 --> 01:25:02,093
- Stop it.
- No. Let go of me!

1089
01:25:02,094 --> 01:25:03,853
We'll find him. Stop it.

1090
01:25:03,895 --> 01:25:08,680
We'll find him. We'll find him.

1091
01:25:09,567 --> 01:25:12,793
- Dominic!
- Did he say anything before he left?

1092
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:15,998
I don't know.
He said something about going to get his lasers.

1093
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:20,269
Lasers?
I think I know where he is.

1094
01:25:52,443 --> 01:25:57,095
Help! Help! Help!

1095
01:25:57,114 --> 01:26:01,753
- Somebody! Help!
- Dominic. Hold on!

1096
01:26:01,786 --> 01:26:03,579
- Hod this. I'll get him down.
- Dominic, be careful.

1097
01:26:03,663 --> 01:26:04,864
Help!

1098
01:26:04,867 --> 01:26:08,222
Just hold on. I'm right here.
Good boy.

1099
01:26:08,229 --> 01:26:12,882
All right. Just hold on.
Okay. Okay. Just hold on.

1100
01:26:12,964 --> 01:26:18,962
- Oh, good. Okay.
- I was going to put the lasers in the antenna.

1101
01:26:19,095 --> 01:26:21,931
I know.
Don't worry about anything now. Okay.

1102
01:26:21,973 --> 01:26:24,659
I got you. All right.
Just hold on tight now.

1103
01:26:24,662 --> 01:26:27,068
Hold on tight, okay?
Good.

1104
01:26:33,484 --> 01:26:37,912
If I lost Dominic, I don't think I could go on living.

1105
01:26:37,989 --> 01:26:43,349
- You're not going to lose him.
- That's right. I'm not.

1106
01:26:45,121 --> 01:26:50,543
Cullen told everybody I stole his money that way all
these creeps keep looking for us to collect big reward.

1107
01:26:50,626 --> 01:26:56,153
- You don't know what he's like.
- Oh, yes, I do. I know him well.

1108
01:26:56,160 --> 01:26:58,959
That's why I don't want him to get
his hand on you and Dominic.

1109
01:26:58,963 --> 01:27:02,471
- I can't trust you. I can't trust anybody.
- You can trust me.

1110
01:27:02,476 --> 01:27:04,440
Oh, yeah. That's what you said before.

1111
01:27:05,808 --> 01:27:08,728
And you turned out to be a cop.

1112
01:27:08,811 --> 01:27:12,440
I--I didn't mean to hurt you.

1113
01:27:12,523 --> 01:27:18,045
I wish I was a kindergarten teacher, but I'm not.

1114
01:27:18,049 --> 01:27:22,425
I'm a cop. That's all I know how to be.

1115
01:27:22,533 --> 01:27:25,711
I have to get out of here.

1116
01:27:25,794 --> 01:27:30,955
You have a son.
If you were me, you'd do the same thing.

1117
01:27:33,753 --> 01:27:37,673
I have a son I've hardly seen in the last seven years.

1118
01:27:37,715 --> 01:27:40,267
I don't mean anything to him.

1119
01:27:41,886 --> 01:27:48,071
My ex-wife got remarried.
She doesn't want me to be part of his life.

1120
01:27:52,162 --> 01:27:53,748
I lost my family.

1121
01:27:55,066 --> 01:27:58,319
I should never have let it happen.

1122
01:27:58,402 --> 01:28:01,280
Why are you telling me all of this?

1123
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:04,825
I don't want to lose you.

1124
01:28:08,412 --> 01:28:10,873
I don't want to lose Dominic.

1125
01:28:14,585 --> 01:28:18,673
I swear you'll never have to run from him again.

1126
01:28:32,769 --> 01:28:36,988
Don't worry about anything, okay?
We're just going to be right across the hall.

1127
01:28:36,994 --> 01:28:40,202
Everything's going to be fine.
Look, we just want to be extra careful.

1128
01:28:40,278 --> 01:28:42,237
- Thanks.
- Don't worry.

1129
01:28:43,080 --> 01:28:46,157
Whoo!

1130
01:28:46,951 --> 81:28:48,995
All right, all right.
Settle down.

1131
01:28:53,958 --> 01:28:55,668
Good morning.

1132
01:28:55,751 --> 01:29:00,715
Good morning, Mr. Kimble.

1133
01:29:00,798 --> 01:29:05,338
Sit down.
It's very nice to see you all again.

1134
01:29:05,344 --> 01:29:08,264
Meet my very good friend, Phoebe O'Hara.

1135
01:29:08,306 --> 01:29:11,559
Good morning, Phoebe.

1136
01:29:11,642 --> 01:29:15,563
Now, Miss O'Hara is going to talk to you
about something very important.

1137
01:29:15,646 --> 01:29:20,026
So I want you to pay real attention
to what she has to say, okay?

1138
01:29:20,109 --> 01:29:24,243
- Remember, no fear.
- Thanks.

1139
01:29:26,365 --> 01:29:27,525
Yeah?

1140
01:29:28,659 --> 01:29:32,354
Boys have a penis.
Girls have a vagina.

1141
01:29:39,212 --> 01:29:43,472
Well, you taught them the basics.
That's important.

1142
01:29:43,633 --> 01:29:49,096
Okay, now, today we're going to talk
about something else that's really important.

1143
01:29:49,138 --> 01:29:52,383
Today we're going to talk about strangers.

1144
01:29:52,408 --> 01:29:57,613
Like let's say you are at home and if a stranger
knocks on your door, should never answer the door.

1145
01:29:57,617 --> 01:30:00,358
Never. Because we never talk to strangers.

1146
01:30:00,541 --> 01:30:06,437
- Okay, why don't we all say that together.
- We never talk to strangers.

1147
01:30:06,444 --> 01:30:09,716
- Right. Okay. Let's say--
- How about kids. Can we talk to kids?

1148
01:30:09,758 --> 01:30:12,036
Yeah, it's okay.
You can talk to kids. That's all right.

1149
01:30:12,119 --> 01:30:13,538
What about dogs?

1150
01:30:13,621 --> 01:30:14,914
Huh?

1151
01:30:14,997 --> 01:30:16,916
Can we talk to dogs?

1152
01:30:16,958 --> 01:30:19,457
Yeah, you can talk to dogs. That's okay.

1153
01:30:19,460 --> 01:30:25,262
But what you can't do,
what you must never ever, ever, ever, ever, do is...

1154
01:30:25,266 --> 01:30:29,345
...never talk to strangers.

1155
01:30:29,828 --> 01:30:35,760
On the kindergarten level,
we try to emphasize the three C's:

1156
01:30:36,043 --> 01:30:39,838
Caring, courtesy and courage.

1157
01:30:42,258 --> 01:30:43,342
Courage.

1158
01:30:43,384 --> 01:30:48,085
- That's my philosophy, too.
- Are you a single parent, Mr. Green?

1159
01:30:48,097 --> 01:30:52,702
No, my wife had to stay behind and finish
to complete the sale of our home.

1160
01:30:52,705 --> 01:30:57,147
She asked me to check out throughout the schools
before we come here and buy a home here.

1161
01:30:57,231 --> 01:31:01,827
- Most kindergarten children can't read yet.
- My son can.

1162
01:31:01,902 --> 01:31:06,321
- Really. He reads at 6? That's good.
- And writes. I taught him myself.

1163
01:31:06,327 --> 01:31:11,336
- He sounds like a very special child.
- Yes, he is. He's a great athlete.

1164
01:31:11,412 --> 01:31:15,731
Here's what you've been waited for.
The kindergarten. Have a look.

1165
01:31:16,492 --> 01:31:21,130
Oh, Dominic, Dominic, Dominic is king of the mountain!

1166
01:31:21,213 --> 01:31:23,632
Way to go, Dominic.

1167
01:31:23,716 --> 01:31:25,175
Here's your crown.

1168
01:31:25,259 --> 01:31:28,360
Congratulations, Dominic.
The king of Mount Kimble!

1169
01:31:28,387 --> 01:31:29,638
Dominic.

1170
01:31:31,974 --> 01:31:33,434
Ahh!

1171
01:31:33,475 --> 01:31:34,852
Ha ha ha!

1172
01:31:34,935 --> 01:31:39,905
- He looks little odd, but he's a wonderful teacher.
- Yes, I'm sure he is.

1173
01:31:46,906 --> 01:31:48,824
Did you see Cullen Jr.?

1174
01:31:48,908 --> 01:31:50,159
Yeah, yeah.

1175
01:31:50,242 --> 01:31:54,377
She calls him Dominic.
She'd always wanted to name him Dominic.

1176
01:31:54,383 --> 01:31:55,915
What a dumb name.

1177
01:31:55,998 --> 01:31:59,543
Put that cigar out.
It's unhealthy for the kid.

1178
01:32:52,846 --> 01:32:56,225
Then you make your aeroplane go up into the clouds.

1179
01:33:00,521 --> 01:33:01,897
Check it out.

1180
01:33:01,981 --> 01:33:02,898
Right.

1181
01:33:02,982 --> 01:33:04,483
Okay, stay calm.

1182
01:33:04,566 --> 01:33:07,611
Okay, it's probably a fire drill.

1183
01:33:07,695 --> 01:33:08,821
Oh, man.

1184
01:33:08,862 --> 01:33:14,236
- Kimble, the hallway's full of smoke.
- Okay, this is a fire drill. Come on. Come on.

1185
01:33:14,243 --> 01:33:20,005
This is the real thing now.
Just the way we practiced it. Go back to-- Go out there.

1186
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:23,085
Fast. Just the way we practiced it.

1187
01:33:27,381 --> 01:33:28,924
Come on.

1188
01:33:34,597 --> 01:33:35,681
Come on.

1189
01:33:35,764 --> 01:33:38,350
It's only water.
Don't be scared.

1190
01:33:40,561 --> 01:33:43,522
Stay close to the wall.
Let's go.

1191
01:33:43,564 --> 01:33:45,691
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

1192
01:33:45,733 --> 01:33:48,193
Dominic, stay close to me, okay?

1193
01:33:48,235 --> 01:33:50,429
Come on. Stay close to me.

1194
01:33:53,032 --> 01:33:55,284
Stay behind me.

1195
01:33:55,367 --> 01:33:56,619
Don't get separated.

1196
01:34:11,759 --> 01:34:13,177
Are you all right?

1197
01:34:13,260 --> 01:34:15,054
Come on. Let's go.

1198
01:34:15,115 --> 01:34:21,105
Dominic, wait!
Dominic! Dominic!

1199
01:34:22,978 --> 01:34:26,430
Help! Somebody help me! Help!

1200
01:34:26,440 --> 01:34:29,559
Stranger! Stranger!

1201
01:34:29,610 --> 01:34:31,153
Stranger!
Stranger!

1202
01:34:31,237 --> 01:34:33,254
Stranger! Stranger!

1203
01:34:33,322 --> 01:34:37,091
Dominic! Where's Dominic?
Dominic!

1204
01:35:02,101 --> 01:35:04,853
Okay, stay together.
Stay together.

1205
01:35:04,937 --> 01:35:08,774
Stay together.
Hold onto your partner.

1206
01:35:08,857 --> 01:35:10,359
Okay, now don't lag behind.

1207
01:35:10,442 --> 01:35:11,860
Hold onto my hand.

1208
01:35:11,944 --> 01:35:13,112
Stay together.

1209
01:35:13,153 --> 01:35:17,072
- Where's Dominic? Where's Dominic?
- He's inside. Kimble's looking for him.

1210
01:35:17,157 --> 01:35:19,475
Joyce! Joyce!

1211
01:35:48,689 --> 01:35:49,773
Help!

1212
01:35:49,857 --> 01:35:53,185
- It's okay. It's okay.
- I'm not going to hurt you.

1213
01:35:53,190 --> 01:35:55,279
I'm not going to hurt you.

1214
01:35:55,362 --> 01:35:56,322
It's okay.

1215
01:35:56,405 --> 01:35:58,324
I'm a fireman.

1216
01:35:58,365 --> 01:35:59,992
I help people.

1217
01:36:04,038 --> 01:36:06,415
Well, where's your hat?

1218
01:36:07,541 --> 01:36:11,261
My hat?
I love this.

1219
01:36:11,337 --> 01:36:16,176
I can't fool my own boy.
He's just 6 years old.

1220
01:36:16,258 --> 01:36:17,301
You're right.

1221
01:36:17,384 --> 01:36:20,179
I'm no jerk fireman.

1222
01:36:22,348 --> 01:36:24,808
I'm going to tell you something, Dominic.

1223
01:36:24,892 --> 01:36:30,840
It's going to be hard for you to understand,
but you got to believe me.

1224
01:36:36,070 --> 01:36:38,864
I'm your father, Dominic.

1225
01:36:38,906 --> 01:36:40,924
Your father.

1226
01:36:42,868 --> 01:36:44,787
Don't you recognize me?

1227
01:36:45,913 --> 01:36:46,997
No.

1228
01:36:47,081 --> 01:36:52,158
Sure you do. It's me.
Don't you remember Twinkle, twinkle, little star?

1229
01:36:52,186 --> 01:36:55,130
See we have the same kind of hands.

1230
01:36:55,214 --> 01:36:56,882
Don't you remember?

1231
01:36:56,924 --> 01:37:00,586
You're not my father.
My father lives in France.

1232
01:37:00,587 --> 01:37:03,847
Your mother told you that, but that's not true Dominic!

1233
01:37:03,931 --> 01:37:05,307
I'm your father!

1234
01:37:05,391 --> 01:37:10,666
- I've been searching for you for five long years.
- Help! Help!

1235
01:37:10,729 --> 01:37:12,447
Dominic, I'm your father.

1236
01:37:12,451 --> 01:37:16,892
You're goinna have to learn to trust me
and to do what I say. Do you understand?

1237
01:37:19,780 --> 01:37:21,490
Freeze!

1238
01:37:21,574 --> 01:37:25,676
- Don't you know the building is on fire?
- We thought it was another drill. - Yeah.

1239
01:37:25,744 --> 01:37:28,279
- Well, get out!
- Yes, sir.

1240
01:37:46,307 --> 01:37:48,826
Whoa, honey.
That's a fire in there.

1241
01:37:48,830 --> 01:37:51,380
- Yeah. I know. I got a kid in there. I got to get inside.
- No way.

1242
01:37:51,381 --> 01:37:54,841
- Look man. I'm a cop.
- Well, if I need a ticket fixed, I think I'll call you.

1243
01:37:54,882 --> 01:37:57,234
- So you gotta in the meantime, stay the hell out of here.
- Oh. Come on.

1244
01:37:57,318 --> 01:37:58,235
Go on.

1245
01:37:58,319 --> 01:37:59,278
All right.

1246
01:38:35,356 --> 01:38:37,641
Quiet, you hear me? Quiet.

1247
01:38:44,573 --> 01:38:45,783
No!

1248
01:38:45,866 --> 01:38:46,784
Rachel!

1249
01:38:46,867 --> 01:38:47,785
Let go!

1250
01:38:47,868 --> 01:38:49,453
Just what I need.

1251
01:38:49,536 --> 01:38:52,455
Please, Cullen let him go.
Let him go!

1252
01:38:52,539 --> 01:38:56,001
How the hell do you get out of here?

1253
01:38:57,544 --> 01:39:00,172
Please, please, don't do this!

1254
01:39:00,256 --> 01:39:01,507
You're scaring him!

1255
01:39:01,548 --> 01:39:06,843
Scared? Of course he's scared.
You told him all these lies about me.

1256
01:39:06,887 --> 01:39:09,723
My son doesn't even know me because of you.

1257
01:39:09,807 --> 01:39:11,808
Listen to me!
Don't. Just listen.

1258
01:39:11,892 --> 01:39:15,401
- I'm his father. You stole him from me!
- Please, don't do this, give him back.

1259
01:39:15,479 --> 01:39:17,189
Don't touch him!

1260
01:39:18,649 --> 01:39:20,559
Dominic, I had to do it!

1261
01:39:20,562 --> 01:39:23,404
I didn't want to do it.
She made me do it.

1262
01:39:23,487 --> 01:39:26,156
Everything's going to be okay, Dominic.

1263
01:39:26,240 --> 01:39:30,072
Dominic?
Come back.

1264
01:39:30,077 --> 01:39:32,538
We're getting out of here.

1265
01:39:32,580 --> 01:39:33,872
Dominic?

1266
01:39:35,124 --> 01:39:38,043
Going to start a whole new family.

1267
01:39:40,921 --> 01:39:41,922
Dominic!

1268
01:39:44,466 --> 01:39:45,509
Gotcha!

1269
01:39:45,593 --> 01:39:50,393
I really love you. Do you understand that?
Do you? Tell me you understand that.

1270
01:39:50,431 --> 01:39:52,433
Tell me. Say it. Say it!

1271
01:39:52,516 --> 01:39:55,436
I understand.

1272
01:39:55,477 --> 01:39:57,229
Daddy.

1273
01:39:59,356 --> 01:40:00,566
Daddy.

1274
01:40:00,649 --> 01:40:02,709
- Kimble. Hold it!
- What are you doing?

1275
01:40:02,772 --> 01:40:04,904
Right there.
Drop it! Hurry!

1276
01:40:04,987 --> 01:40:06,396
Don't. Don't.

1277
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:09,108
He's not your hostage.
He's your son.

1278
01:40:09,111 --> 01:40:10,451
Drop it. On the floor.

1279
01:40:10,492 --> 01:40:12,620
You'll do this to your own son? Huh?

1280
01:40:12,703 --> 01:40:15,581
Drop it!
I'm losing it! Hurry!

1281
01:40:15,623 --> 01:40:19,150
- Relax. Okay. I'm putting it down.
- Hurry! - Yeah.

1282
01:40:19,159 --> 01:40:24,294
Here it is. Here it is.
Just don't harm the boy, okay?

1283
01:40:24,381 --> 01:40:27,593
Good. Good. That's smart.

1284
01:40:27,635 --> 01:40:32,560
All right. All right.
Why don't you let the boy go now?

1285
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:35,758
The boy is mine!
He's my boy!

1286
01:40:35,763 --> 01:40:38,637
You get your own goddamn family!

1287
01:40:40,898 --> 01:40:42,149
No!

1288
01:40:54,495 --> 01:40:55,955
Are you okay?

1289
01:40:55,996 --> 01:40:58,664
- I'm okay. Get Dominic.
- Okay.

1290
01:40:58,666 --> 01:41:01,005
Dominic! Dominic!

1291
01:41:53,220 --> 01:41:55,848
Where's my grandson?

1292
01:41:57,141 --> 01:41:58,684
I don't know.

1293
01:42:01,604 --> 01:42:03,814
Where's my grandson?

1294
01:42:03,897 --> 01:42:05,691
Go to hell.

1295
01:42:08,068 --> 01:42:11,488
That's where you're going, you son of a bitch!

1296
01:42:19,413 --> 01:42:23,375
You're not so tough without your car, are you?

1297
01:42:36,096 --> 01:42:38,933
Mr. Kimble, are you all right?

1298
01:43:22,393 --> 01:43:24,595
Oh, I hate this.

1299
01:43:28,691 --> 01:43:31,777
Nah, he doesn't want to eat that.

1300
01:43:31,819 --> 01:43:35,789
He's a tough guy.
Tough guys don't eat Jell-O.

1301
01:43:35,823 --> 01:43:37,283
I'll come back later.

1302
01:43:37,324 --> 01:43:39,784
- Hi.
- Hi. How you feeling?

1303
01:43:39,827 --> 01:43:41,245
Much better.

1304
01:43:41,328 --> 01:43:42,746
How about you?

1305
01:43:42,830 --> 01:43:46,293
I'll live. Man you have to check out of here.
This stuff will kill you.

1306
01:43:46,375 --> 01:43:48,460
Just don't throw up on me.

1307
01:43:48,502 --> 01:43:53,591
I'm not going to throw up on you,
but I am going to kiss you.

1308
01:43:55,342 --> 01:43:56,969
Phoebe.

1309
01:43:57,052 --> 01:43:58,470
Thanks.

1310
01:43:59,680 --> 01:44:01,640
Thanks, partner.

1311
01:44:02,725 --> 01:44:05,287
- Sure.
- Hey, how's everybody feeling today?

1312
01:44:05,289 --> 01:44:07,788
Listen, I brought some goodies for you.
Did I do that?

1313
01:44:07,792 --> 01:44:09,857
- Can you give me the flowers.
- Thank you. Thank you honey.

1314
01:44:09,940 --> 01:44:13,739
All right. I got some goodies and I got it caught on there.

1315
01:44:13,740 --> 01:44:16,340
And little something I cooked it myself for you.

1316
01:44:16,350 --> 01:44:20,059
Henry.
I almost didn't recognize you with all your clothes on.

1317
01:44:20,060 --> 01:44:25,560
Yeah. You look pretty good to yourself.
Did l-- I'm sorry.

1318
01:44:25,562 --> 01:44:28,335
- The wedding. The wedding.
- Yeah. Uh--

1319
01:44:28,375 --> 01:44:33,342
- You're coming to the wedding, right?
- Is it safe?

1320
01:44:35,257 --> 01:44:38,302
I wouldn't miss this for the world.

1321
01:44:39,470 --> 01:44:43,849
So where do we send the invitation?

1322
01:44:43,891 --> 01:44:45,676
Hmm?

1323
01:45:18,592 --> 01:45:20,594
They're all yours.

1324
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:36,779
- Hi, kids.
- Mr. Kimble!

1325
01:45:36,819 --> 01:45:38,237
I'm back.

1326
01:45:41,949 --> 01:45:44,577
Didn't join the union until--

1327
01:45:50,499 --> 01:45:52,251
Class, excuse me.

1328
01:46:18,644 --> 01:46:21,780
Uh-oh. They're going to do it.
