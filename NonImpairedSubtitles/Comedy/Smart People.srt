Now, I want you to call your brother.

161
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:52,934
Tell him to get my car
out of the impound lot.

162
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,707
And to have it here at 9:00 a.m. sharp.

163
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:57,975
Excuse me. No, you do that.

164
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:00,780
You know, because of the seizure,
you can't legally drive for six months.

165
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,877
I have to report it to the DMV.

166
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:05,957
No, just don't report it.
Six months? Six months...

167
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,787
I'm not being your chauffeur
for six months.

168
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:09,758
These times are crucial.

169
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:13,821
Young Republicans. Model UN.
National Honor Society.

170
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:18,495
I will hire a driver on Monday.
The insurance company will pay for it.

171
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:20,799
Okay, well, if you need anything,
just have one of the nurses page me.

172
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:23,238
I'm here all night. Okay?

173
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,537
Now, just go home and get some sleep,

174
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:28,909
and you'll get that perfect SAT score.

175
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:30,641
That's what I've been trying to do.

176
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,081
Mercurial.

177
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:36,352
I learned that word in the fifth grade.

178
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:37,717
Fecundity.

179
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:41,052
English is my first language.

180
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:42,587
Uxorious.

181
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:46,559
That's appropriately obscure.
Mind you, I know it.

182
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:48,758
Overly fond of one's wife.

183
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,358
That's my girl.

184
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:52,397
I have a good one.

185
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:54,063
Eft.

186
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:56,899
Let me ponder.

187
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,973
Short in stature. Diminutive.

188
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:05,280
No, sorry. Eft is a young newt.

189
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,118
They rarely put nouns on the SAT.

190
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,128
You knew that word, right?

191
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:22,826
Of course. A young newt.

192
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:27,904
JAMES: I don't understand why
you had to check out so early.

193
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:30,532
I only get one Saturday morning
per week, you know.

194
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:32,367
Cry me a river.

195
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:36,408
LAWRENCE: Get off it, James.

196
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:38,874
JAMES: So why did you try to jump
the fence

197
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,144
at the impoundment lot, anyway?

198
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:41,844
LAWRENCE:
Where did you hear about the fence?

199
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:44,218
Two people from school
told me this morning.

200
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,813
Can you please move
to the passenger seat?

201
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:49,326
I seriously doubt that sitting
on the right makes you sick.

202
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:51,919
If I vomit, we'll both look stupid.

203
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:57,127
I remember when Mom used to drop
me off at kindergarten on Brighton.

204
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:59,727
You sat in the passenger seat then.

205
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:11,344
(MAN CHATTERING ON TV)

206
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:19,417
What the hell are you doing here?

207
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:22,016
Watching a documentary
on snow apes.

208
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:23,560
Hey, man.

209
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:25,127
Hey, Jim.

210
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:27,096
Good to see you, Chuck.

211
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:29,028
You look like you had
another growth spurt.

212
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:31,625
No, I don't think so.
Not since I saw you last.

213
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:32,726
I'm too old for this.

214
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:36,137
I would like an explanation.
Why are you here?

215
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:39,700
Vanessa said that
you couldn't drive for six months.

216
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,609
So I'm here to help.

217
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,376
VANESSA: Yeah, he's pretty sure he's
gonna move in and be your driver.

218
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:47,145
I think I got the perfect score today.

219
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:49,284
There was one tricky math one...

220
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:54,655
Did it ever occur to you that
I might not want you to drive me?

221
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:56,784
Let alone move in.

222
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,693
It did occur to me,

223
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:02,426
but Vanessa spoke
to the insurance company,

224
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,036
and they're not going to pay
for a chauffeur.

225
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:07,503
And I already wrote a letter of complaint

226
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:09,096
and I wrote a request for an appeal.

227
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:12,769
So, if I could just get
your signature, and I will fax it.

228
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:17,908
I'm a little low on cash right now.

229
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:20,577
I can't really afford
to get my own apartment.

230
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:23,883
So it's kind of a win-win situation.

231
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:26,981
No. It's not a win-win situation.

232
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:30,459
It might be,
if you were even vaguely reliable,

233
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:34,226
- but you're not.
- There's a spare room upstairs.

234
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,665
- There's linens and towels...
- Shh. Shh.

235
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:41,128
Thank you, Jim.

236
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,438
Do you even have
a valid driver's license?

237
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:56,116
I need a ride to campus.
I will see you downstairs

238
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:58,451
- in five minutes.
- You got it!

239
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:01,723
(GROANING)

240
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:36,025
Make a left.

241
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:43,625
ROTH: We need someone
with a national scholarly reputation

242
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:45,465
and strong leadership experience.

243
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:49,805
Well, thank you, Martin.
I am honored to serve in the position.

244
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:51,168
You heard?

245
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:54,872
Word travels fast around here.

246
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,709
Usually it's a pain in the butt
to find someone

247
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:58,476
to chair the search committee.

248
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:03,077
I thought we were hiring
from within the department.

249
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,383
You told me we were hiring
from within the department.

250
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:07,959
Well, everyone else
is so busy this semester.

251
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:10,862
Delivering papers, publishing.

252
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:12,931
Have you read
what they're publishing?

253
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,624
Most of it's garbage.

254
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:16,291
That's not very collegial.

255
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:20,270
Well, neither is forcing me
to chair this search committee, Martin.

256
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,805
I am busy, too.

257
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:24,273
When was the last time
you attended a department meeting?

258
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,343
When was the last time

259
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,412
there was anything on the agenda
worth discussing?

260
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:29,378
I need you to do this.

261
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,478
Bon appétit, Martin.

262
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:36,713
Now that Roth has forced me
to chair the search committee,

263
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:39,313
I can't very well
nominate myself now, can I?

264
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:41,552
You should have had that position
eight years ago.

265
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,594
I mean, that was a travesty
if I ever saw one.

266
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:45,322
You were nine years old at the time.

267
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:47,956
I will tell Roth
that this injury is too much

268
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,399
and it precludes me
from heading the committee.

269
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:52,868
Why do you even want
to be head of the department?

270
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:54,802
You don't like any of
the other professors

271
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,341
and you certainly don't like
any of your students.

272
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:59,934
You know, James,
there was a time not too long ago

273
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:02,104
when students were
passionate about literature.

274
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:04,682
Today's students are
only passionate about getting A's.

275
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:08,652
Dick Cheney.

276
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:13,048
His daughter is a lesbian.

277
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:17,052
And while her partner is
considered to be "one of the family,"

278
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:20,028
they never allowed her
on stage during the campaign.

279
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:22,692
Okay, well, the point is, in 2000,

280
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:26,703
Cheney was the chair of Bush's
vice-presidential search committee.

281
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:29,103
You know, he nominated himself.

282
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:33,166
Nominating myself?
It seems rather unethical.

283
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:36,007
VANESSA:
It's the democratic process.

284
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:40,714
If it can work
for the Vice-President of America,

285
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:43,250
it can work for you.

286
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:49,459
HADLEY: I wanted to call you
all together, one last time,

287
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:51,791
before we were deep into final exams.

288
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:54,525
We've received over 200 applications.

289
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:58,569
Fewer than 10 of the applications
merit serious consideration.

290
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:00,098
Based on what criteria?

291
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:04,608
The criteria listed in the official
university bylaws on faculty hires.

292
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:05,936
When we did this before,

293
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:08,535
we spent a few sessions
devising a rubric

294
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,638
for candidate evaluations.

295
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,508
One based on more humanistic ideals.

296
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:17,546
A few of the better applicants

297
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:20,181
forgot to include copies
of their student evaluations

298
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:21,418
with their applications.

299
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:23,324
Personally, I find the evaluations

300
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:26,295
that students write about me
utterly useless.

301
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:29,296
It's mostly just speculation
about my sexuality.

302
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:34,796
DR. STROUSE: Try not to blink.

303
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:37,307
This is rather uncomfortable.

304
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:39,877
Okay. We're set, Mr. Wetherhold.

305
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:45,610
How come my follow-up
wasn't with Dr. Hartigan?

306
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:47,581
That's because she's the head
of the ER,

307
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:50,086
not a neurologist like myself.

308
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,749
You know, she's gonna kill me
for saying this,

309
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:56,191
but she used to be a student of yours,
years ago.

310
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:58,857
I've had lots of students.

311
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:01,898
I think she had a schoolgirl crush,
in effect.

312
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:07,069
She did, did she? Are we done?

313
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:08,564
Yeah.

314
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:10,742
Pleasure.

315
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:13,878
JANET: Yeah. Still around.

316
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:15,344
MAN: Here you go, miss.

317
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:16,803
Hi.

318
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:22,544
How's your head?
Did you see Dr. Strouse yet?

319
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,856
Yes, everything is fine.

320
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:30,689
I figured it out.

321
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,159
You were my student.

322
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:38,802
You must forgive me
for not remembering the other night

323
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,634
when they brought me into the ER.

324
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:47,707
Did you lose weight?

325
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,547
No, not at all. Same weight.

326
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:55,481
Night.

327
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:07,530
What are you doing?

328
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:09,032
Are these your mom's?

329
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:11,295
Don't get mayonnaise on them.

330
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:21,812
You know,
you should really make your bed.

331
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:23,471
It sets the tone for the day.

332
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:27,045
How do you know what tone
I wanted to set, though?

333
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:36,691
Don't you think it's kind of weird

334
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:39,787
to keep dead people's clothes
lying around?

335
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:42,662
- Yes.
- Dad's been saving them.

336
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,459
It's really not a good thing for him.

337
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:49,739
If we donate them to Goodwill,
we get a tax write-off,

338
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,000
which is great.

339
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,741
You're a monster.

340
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:14,055
May I give you a ride home?

341
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:18,794
No, thank you. My adopted brother
is supposed to pick me up.

342
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:21,368
Are you sure? It's pretty cold.

343
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,675
Okay, thank you.

344
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:34,145
Here.

345
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:03,072
CHUCK:
Don't forget the tax receipt.

346
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:04,307
Right.

347
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:08,479
JANET: You know, you can sit up front
if you want.

348
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:11,385
That's okay. I'm fine.

349
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:12,915
I get

350
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:17,551
nauseated if I ride
on the right-hand side of the car.

351
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:24,595
Dr. Strouse said I was fine

352
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:27,331
and I was wondering
if you could call the DMV

353
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:30,340
and have them repeal
my driving restriction.

354
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,509
That's not how it works.

355
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:39,481
So what are you teaching
this semester?

356
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:42,849
I'm teaching two sections
about the Victorians.

357
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:45,456
Do you like the Victorians?

358
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:46,888
I used to.

359
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:54,428
- The Victorian novel, huh?
- Hmm.

360
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:57,834
Wow, how many times
can you read <i>Bleak House?</i>

361
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:00,002
You never tire of <i>Bleak House.</i>

362
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:03,165
I can always find something new
to say about it.

363
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,879
Don't you have anything better to do?

364
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:19,650
(SIGHS)

365
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,761
You need to relax.

366
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:33,402
You need to relax. I need to study.

367
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:43,170
Great, I'm in an after-school special.

368
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:45,781
You know, your dad used to smoke
all the time

369
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:46,908
when he was in grad school.

370
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:48,007
Oh, yeah?

371
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:51,179
He was too scared to buy it,
so I'd have to do it for him.

372
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:53,382
They called him Hookah Larry.

373
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:57,127
Look, your pathetic attempts
to manipulate me,

374
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:59,322
they're never going to work.

375
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:05,566
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

376
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:23,110
Okay, shut up and give it to me.

377
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,753
If this gives me brain damage,

378
00:25:28,393 --> 00:25:30,020
I will kill you.

379
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:38,400
VANESSA: Lupita is crying over Pedro,
who is being abused by Manuel.

380
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:40,198
She's going to leave Manuel,
you know.

381
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:42,136
He's such a <i>machismo.</i>

382
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,810
She's going to move in with Diego.

383
00:25:46,978 --> 00:25:49,276
He's really handsome and built.

384
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:54,013
If your Spanish were better,
you would see all of that.

385
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:06,758
LAWRENCE: Thank you for driving me.

386
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:08,594
You're welcome.

387
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,729
This is your house, right?

388
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:18,901
Yes.

389
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:33,450
Shit. Wait! Wait! Wait!

390
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,186
(CHUCKLING)

391
00:26:37,662 --> 00:26:39,323
I forgot this.

392
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:47,202
Would you

393
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:49,364
like to have a face-to-face

394
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:52,000
conversation sometime?

395
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:56,443
We could finish our
discussion of Victorian literature.

396
00:26:56,548 --> 00:27:00,882
We weren't really having a
conversation about Victorian literature.

397
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:06,248
I suppose I'd have to drive.

398
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:09,752
I hadn't thought of that.

399
00:27:13,331 --> 00:27:15,765
How about Friday night at 7:30

400
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:18,199
for a face-to-face conversation?

401
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,998
That would work.

402
00:27:22,073 --> 00:27:23,563
Okay, bye.

403
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:33,484
(DOOR CLOSING)

404
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,291
Smell something burning?

405
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:44,184
Maybe cannabis?

406
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:47,929
Are you mad?

407
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:52,669
I waited outside
the medical center for eons.

408
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:55,596
Where were you?

409
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:58,339
Helping Vanessa with her Spanish.

410
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,002
Lost track of time, sorry.

411
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,622
Where'd you get that?

412
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:19,218
The closet.

413
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:21,855
I told him Wellesley
was a women's college.

414
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:23,998
That's Caroline's sweatshirt.

415
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:26,969
That, too. I told him that, too. I told him

416
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:29,199
it was Mom's sweatshirt.

417
00:28:29,307 --> 00:28:30,274
(CLEARS THROAT)

418
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:33,203
Take it off, please.

419
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:39,574
Did it ever occur to you
that I might be saving that sweatshirt?

420
00:28:39,684 --> 00:28:41,413
Please don't rip it.

421
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:54,397
(WHISPERING) I think
he may have smelled the pot.

422
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:57,400
"I told him Wellesley
was a women's college."

423
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,871
God, what a narc.

424
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:31,225
CHUCK: You know, we didn't just
donate her clothes on a whim.

425
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:34,134
We did it for your
psychological well-being.

426
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:36,230
Will you wait in the car?

427
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:48,145
Let's see, "Professor Wetherhold
is a conceited dickhead,"

428
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:51,051
"An asshole," "Unfair..."

429
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:52,145
Here's one.

430
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:53,622
What does it say?

431
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:55,215
"Professor Wetherhold
is knowledgeable,

432
00:29:55,326 --> 00:29:57,590
"but he doesn't impart that knowledge
to his students.

433
00:29:57,695 --> 00:29:59,890
"He barked information at us
all semester,

434
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:02,193
"and then he complained
when our papers did not measure up

435
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,200
"to his bizarre standards."

436
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:06,127
I'll dig deeper.

437
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:13,305
JAMES: Hey, can we go to the mall
tonight instead of this afternoon?

438
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:15,208
There's, like, three games
I want to watch.

439
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,611
I can't go to the mall tonight.

440
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:20,240
- Why's that?
- I'm busy.

441
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:23,846
Yeah, busy with what?
I fucking gotta go to the mall.

442
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:25,786
LAWRENCE: I have an appointment.

443
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:27,886
- CHUCK: Really?
- Yes.

444
00:30:28,092 --> 00:30:29,320
With who?

445
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:32,592
- With none of your business.
- An appointment with whom?

446
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:33,755
None of your business.

447
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:36,595
I just want to know. God!

448
00:30:38,636 --> 00:30:40,194
Dr. Hartigan.

449
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:43,841
- I knew it.
- Good work.

450
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:47,543
You spend $50 on dinner,

451
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:50,443
that's grounds for intercourse
with "none of your business."

452
00:30:50,548 --> 00:30:54,245
Dad, if there are any romantic inklings,
you're simply not ready.

453
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:57,480
I mean the sociosexual
mores have really shifted.

454
00:30:58,389 --> 00:31:02,291
And look, let's not forget
the stigma attached to widowers.

455
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:07,631
Widowers. At some point the statute
of limitations has gotta run out on that.

456
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:10,393
We're not talking about this anymore.

457
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:16,707
Don't freak out and sabotage it
like you always do.

458
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:19,333
I don't always freak out
and sabotage it.

459
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:22,641
Yeah, well, this hospital is littered
with men you've left in your wake.

460
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:25,978
It's littered with men
you've left in your wake, too.

461
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:28,552
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

462
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:32,320
Nothing. I'm just reading something.
I'll call you back, okay?

463
00:31:55,446 --> 00:31:56,777
- Hi.
- Hi, there.

464
00:31:56,881 --> 00:31:58,246
How are you?

465
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,053
What are you doing here?

466
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:04,851
Excuse me?

467
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:10,486
He's kind of a fragile guy.

468
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:13,763
You know, he's not ready for this.

469
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:16,330
He's fragile? What do you mean?

470
00:32:17,835 --> 00:32:20,429
You know what?
It's quite predatory, actually.

471
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:24,798
Have you forgotten about
the Hippocratic oath you took,

472
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:26,934
about not fucking your patients?

473
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:30,647
Your father's no longer my patient.

474
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:50,194
We respond to literary texts

475
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:54,260
using precisely the same
fundamental interpretive categories

476
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:56,636
as authors and poets use
to create them.

477
00:32:56,741 --> 00:33:00,199
So there's no need to posit

- Yeah.

Any coffee?
Something from the desert menu?

481
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,609
- Yeah. I want...
- It's too late for coffee.

00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,018
I'll tell you what.

483
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:13,921
One piece of chocolate cake
and two forks, two plates.

- Thank you.

- 45 minutes.

since I've uttered a single word.

489
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:35,204
I mean, do you even know
where I'm from?

490
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:36,712
Where I grew up, where I live?

491
00:33:36,814 --> 00:33:38,338
Do you know anything
about my family?

492
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:40,542
What kind of day did I have?

493
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,647
Well, if you actually did want to know,

494
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:46,651
I was having a great day
until about 30 minutes ago

495
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:48,988
when I realized
you weren't gonna shut up.

496
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:55,289
In fact, you actually gave me a C
in your course.

497
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,698
You said my paper was sophomoric.

498
00:33:58,169 --> 00:33:59,796
I was a freshman.

499
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:02,401
That's not what sophomoric means.

500
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:04,498
I know. See, I know that.

501
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,043
You know, the other night
when I drove you home,

502
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:10,273
I actually thought I saw
a different side of you.

503
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:16,051
But now I'm back to thinking
you're the same pompous windbag

504
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:18,748
who made me switch my major
from English to Biology.

505
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:22,792
Well. Certainly an established
physician is not harboring resentment

506
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,192
for a grade she received
more than 10 years ago.

507
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:26,991
This was a mistake.

508
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,000
Your daughter was right.

509
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,331
Thank you.

It's probably better
if you get a cab home.

you did not get laid.

This is a good-sized room.

00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:12,837
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
you've been in here before.

518
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:19,045
Do you think I'm self-absorbed?

519
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:23,378
I think self-absorption's underrated.

520
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:28,758
I think everyone needs
some compassion,

521
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:32,626
some capacity for sympathy, empathy.

And do you know why?

She scored in the 45th percentile
on her SAT.

528
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:01,383
People like you and me
don't need to compensate.

You know, I'm glad you're home early.

530

That physician wasn't good for you.

531
00:36:06,797 --> 00:36:09,960
Too young and kind of uncultured,

533
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:16,804
I thought of the perfect new title
for your book.

That gurney was sterile.

545
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:16,955
I re-read your essay.

546
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:18,128
And...

547
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:21,294
At first I considered
giving it a higher grade,

548
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:24,959
but then, I decided
that the C should stick.

549
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:29,138
Do you honestly think
that I care about a grade I received

550
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,003
when I was a freshman in college?

551
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:33,906
I mean, I admit that the paper,
as you originally wrote,

552
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:37,503
"lacks a clear focus
and rambles like a bad folk song."

553
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:41,915
But I read it again the other day
and its thesis is really quite good.

554
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:49,792
I should have been more diplomatic
and less pompous as your professor

True.

I'm just out of practice.

558
00:38:57,001 --> 00:39:00,334
What? Usually you're better
at masking your pomposity?

559
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:03,302

00:44:34,238 --> 00:44:35,933
That is disgusting.

637
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:41,978
You must miss your wife.

638
00:44:44,248 --> 00:44:46,182
Sorry, I shouldn't be so direct.

639
00:44:46,283 --> 00:44:49,719
If my wife, Caroline,
were here right now,

640
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:52,618
she would be telling me
to stop pitying myself.

641
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:57,957
She was a lovely,
funny, intelligent woman.

642
00:44:58,796 --> 00:45:01,026
And she'd want you to know it.

643
00:45:01,298 --> 00:45:05,530
But she'd also advise me
not to talk about my dead wife

644
00:45:05,636 --> 00:45:09,970
on a date with a beautiful woman.

645
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:15,605
And she'd be wondering

646
00:45:16,413 --> 00:45:19,905
when I was going to get around
to kissing you.

What's it like sitting alone
at lunch every day?

657
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:00,184
It sucks.

Do you have any plans for Christmas?

Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, a telemarketer.

Hi, Janet, sorry to leave you
yet another message,

711
00:52:25,208 --> 00:52:27,472
but I realized that you may not have
my phone number,

712
00:52:27,577 --> 00:52:30,273

called me back.

that you can't hold your alcohol?

715
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:51,692
I'm having one glass, moron.

716
00:52:53,103 --> 00:52:56,800
And I chose this Beaujolais
specifically to go with the ham.

Let's all just get drunk.

720
00:53:18,962 --> 00:53:21,260
I need something
to wash down this rubber ham.

721
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:24,731
Actually, I downloaded the recipe
from the Internet.

722
00:53:25,569 --> 00:53:28,037
I translated it from Old French.

723
00:53:28,605 --> 00:53:31,301
It dates all the way back to Louis XIV.

724
00:53:31,408 --> 00:53:32,739
And he was the one
that actually decided

725
00:53:32,842 --> 00:53:35,072
dishes should be served in courses,

726
00:53:35,178 --> 00:53:39,581
because before that,
it was served as this big pile of food...

727
00:53:39,683 --> 00:53:42,914
Maybe you messed up the translation,
and that's why it tastes like burnt tires.

728
00:53:43,019 --> 00:53:45,954
Well, if you'd like,
I could jam that up your ass for you?

729
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:48,752
That's enough. Enough.

00:53:53,363 --> 00:53:55,524
- Well, this is cheerful.
- Shut up.

00:54:16,486 --> 00:54:17,976
You're the doctor girlfriend, right?

735
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:20,488
You're the adopted brother, right?

736
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:24,253
Well, you don't appear to be boring.

737
00:54:24,361 --> 00:54:27,797
Well, you've just met me.
For all you know, I'm quite boring.

738
00:54:27,897 --> 00:54:29,592
You've presented yourself here,

739
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:32,099
uninvited and unannounced
for Christmas dinner.

740
00:54:32,202 --> 00:54:35,103
That is not boring. And the cake?

741
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:40,167
Lexotonin? That's an antidepressant.

742
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:42,541
I stole it from the break room.

743
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:46,611
- Am I interrupting anything?
- No, welcome.

744
00:54:46,983 --> 00:54:48,951
We could use a little antivenom
in the snake pit.

745
00:54:49,052 --> 00:54:51,919
Thank you very much.
Move along, thank you.

00:54:52,022 --> 00:54:53,011

Merry Christmas.

The woman brought a cake.

00:55:14,177 --> 00:55:15,337
Hello.

Vanessa!

752
00:55:19,182 --> 00:55:21,241
I'm getting the physician a plate!

753
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:48,402
My, what a generous portion.

754
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:49,500
Enjoy.

is the perfect little housewife.

756
00:55:51,581 --> 00:55:52,775
I mean, daughter.

757
00:55:52,882 --> 00:55:54,645
Yes, if, by perfect, you mean

758
00:55:54,751 --> 00:55:59,120
not retarded/suffering from
insurmountable credit card debt,

759

then, yes, I am indeed perfect.

Would you two please stop bickering?

761
00:56:04,561 --> 00:56:07,655
These children haven't
been properly parented in many years.

762
00:56:07,764 --> 00:56:08,958
That's why I was brought in.

763
00:56:09,065 --> 00:56:11,863
To ensure that they don't
kill each other.

764
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:15,262
Merry Christmas.

765
00:56:19,642 --> 00:56:20,802
Please.

William Carlos Williams.

769
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:31,815
He was a physician.

770
00:56:32,455 --> 00:56:34,047
Yes, I know that.

771
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:39,318
Many considered him to be an imagist,
but he was really more of a modernist,

772
00:56:39,429 --> 00:56:41,522
eschewing the poetic traditions
of Europe,

773
00:56:41,631 --> 00:56:44,691
in favor of celebrating
everyday circumstances.

774
00:56:46,936 --> 00:56:48,528
But I digress.

775
00:56:50,974 --> 00:56:53,704
I like suburban Pittsburgh
for Christmas.

776
00:56:54,144 --> 00:56:56,339
Yes, it's really glamorous.

777
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,142
You're in the

00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:02,150
Paris of Western Pennsylvania.

779
00:57:05,789 --> 00:57:08,155
I'm really glad that you stopped by.

780
00:57:18,902 --> 00:57:21,769
I just saw Dad and the physician
kissing in the den.

781
00:57:21,871 --> 00:57:23,532
I am going to puke.

782
00:57:23,873 --> 00:57:26,899
Why does physical affection
bother you so much?

783
00:57:27,243 --> 00:57:28,972
It doesn't, actually.

784
00:57:29,212 --> 00:57:31,942
Well, you're not the only one
who deserves to have a little fun.

00:57:32,048 --> 00:57:33,447
And what's your point?

786
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:36,041
I saw you both at Gibraltar's. Drunk.

787
00:57:36,152 --> 00:57:37,380
I saw you, too.

788
00:57:37,487 --> 00:57:39,648
I saw you, too, man. Bravo.

789
00:57:51,131 --> 00:57:54,862
I am proud that we whittled it down
to these three so quickly.

790
00:57:54,968 --> 00:57:57,266
I have another candidate in mind.

791
00:57:58,004 --> 00:57:59,028
Who?

792
00:58:00,707 --> 00:58:01,696
Me.

793
00:58:01,942 --> 00:58:05,275
Can you apply?
You're the chair of the committee.

794

Yes, I am permitted to apply.

It's well within Carnegie Mellon's
ethical codes of conduct.

796
00:58:12,118 --> 00:58:14,916
It's part of the democratic process.

You drove yourself...

you better have a word on that board.

Are you coming home for dinner?

805
00:58:48,989 --> 00:58:51,890
Because Chuck's gone
and I'm the only one here.

I'm eating here tonight.

Well, that's just fantastic.

00:58:56,997 --> 00:58:59,830
What am I supposed to do
with the beef stroganoff that I made,

809
00:58:59,933 --> 00:59:01,867
and the garlic whipped potatoes?

810
00:59:05,005 --> 00:59:08,338
I'm going to be home in a few hours,

Well,

00:59:29,829 --> 00:59:32,696
it is a very interesting concept, isn't it?

819
00:59:38,004 --> 00:59:41,633
Yeah, I always wondered
who littered the world with those.

00:59:42,175 --> 00:59:45,167
Where have you been?
I haven't seen you, like, all week.

I've been busy.

822
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:49,542
I don't want you to feel uncomfortable
around me, okay?

823
00:59:49,649 --> 00:59:52,209
I completely respect
your homosexuality,

from any further untoward advances.

Truth be told,
I've started dating someone.

Someone my own age.

827

What's his name?

Her name

829
01:00:09,936 --> 01:00:11,870
is none of your business.

830
01:00:11,972 --> 01:00:15,499
I will be staying at her apartment
a couple of nights a week.

831
01:00:15,675 --> 01:00:17,836
So does she know you're gay?

832
01:00:20,914 --> 01:00:24,315
I don't think that you and I
should be hanging out as much.

833
01:00:25,018 --> 01:00:27,680
Well, that's just... It's idiotic.

834
01:00:28,488 --> 01:00:30,820
I mean, who am I supposed to
hang out with?

835
01:00:30,924 --> 01:00:34,416
I just think that we both need to,
you know, get a life.

836
01:00:35,362 --> 01:00:39,025
My life begins when I set foot
in California next fall.

837
01:00:41,768 --> 01:00:43,793
The cab was $9!

838

I'll pay you back.

839
01:00:48,074 --> 01:00:49,166
Well,

840
01:00:50,610 --> 01:00:53,135
- they're publishing my book.
- What?

841
01:00:53,913 --> 01:00:55,141
Who the fuck's gonna read that?

842
01:00:55,248 --> 01:00:58,217
Bloomberg. I knew it. I so knew it!

843
01:00:58,752 --> 01:01:01,084
Well, when do we...
When are we going to meet with them?

844
01:01:01,955 --> 01:01:03,582
You have school.

845
01:01:03,690 --> 01:01:06,215
So I'm taking Janet and

I was kind of hoping
you could float me some greenbacks

So, no.

They've edited it, significantly.
But it's much better.

They've edited thousands of books,

And are you honestly okay
with the changes?

Well, Bloomberg wants
to take us out to dinner.

Well, for lack of a better term,
you're my girlfriend.

01:05:52,178 --> 01:05:54,738
No, what am I to you? Not just a term.

You should go. I'm gonna be fine.

You'd think their parents would
control them.

They've probably been

Call me a grouch,
I just think that it's wrong

to let kids run around an airport
unsupervised.

922

When you have children,
you'll understand.

923
01:07:03,850 --> 01:07:07,581
This isn't about unsupervised kids
at an airport, and you know it.

Just try asking.

Okay. What the hell's your problem?

929
01:07:30,009 --> 01:07:32,671
I don't want to talk about it right now.

930
01:07:35,581 --> 01:07:36,878
I have it.

931
01:07:42,088 --> 01:07:45,717
You don't seem very happy.

932
01:07:45,825 --> 01:07:49,454

950
01:09:05,872 --> 01:09:09,364
and everything's kind
of perfect for you, so

951
01:09:09,475 --> 01:09:11,773
don't screw everything up, okay?

952
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:16,305
You know, I read in <i>Cosmopolitan</i>
that it takes

953
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:20,078
about half the time you date someone
to get over them.

954
01:09:20,186 --> 01:09:23,713
And, what, you've dated Janet
for just a few months?

955
01:09:23,823 --> 01:09:27,759
- You read <i>Cosmopolitan?</i>
- I glance at it.

956
01:09:28,928 --> 01:09:32,420
Like, at the supermarket,
if the line's particularly long.

957
01:09:34,767 --> 01:09:36,735
You know that physician,

958
01:09:38,237 --> 01:09:42,003
she's just a rebound relationship,
that's all.

959
01:09:42,108 --> 01:09:44,633
A rebound from what?

960
01:09:44,744 --> 01:09:46,177
From Mom.

961
01:10:05,498 --> 01:10:08,296
Lawrence,
congratulations on your book deal.

962
01:10:08,534 --> 01:10:09,558
Thank you.

963
01:10:09,669 --> 01:10:13,537
And James' poem being accepted
by the <i>New Yorker.</i>

964
01:10:13,773 --> 01:10:15,400
With Lawrence's book it may seem like

965
01:10:15,508 --> 01:10:18,272
bringing the other three candidates
to campus is a waste of time.

966
01:10:18,377 --> 01:10:21,210
But according to the bylaws,
we have to.

967
01:10:21,314 --> 01:10:23,111
What about his recommendation letter?

968
01:10:23,215 --> 01:10:26,343
Lawrence, could you
tell us about your book?

969
01:10:26,452 --> 01:10:28,010
It's an examination of critical theory

970
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:30,520
from the standpoint that
every school of criticism has failed us.

971
01:10:30,623 --> 01:10:33,217
I start out with a brief history
of criticism, then I...

972
01:10:33,359 --> 01:10:34,621
(SIGHING)

973
01:10:37,797 --> 01:10:40,095
Penguin Group seems to like it.

974
01:10:44,303 --> 01:10:45,634
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

975
01:10:46,072 --> 01:10:47,699
Shit.

976
01:10:56,349 --> 01:10:58,317
I heard about the <i>New Yorker.</i>

977
01:10:58,451 --> 01:11:00,180
Why didn't you tell me
about the poem?

978
01:11:00,286 --> 01:11:01,685
I... I...

979
01:11:01,787 --> 01:11:04,221
- I need to read it.
- You need to read it?

980
01:11:04,323 --> 01:11:05,984
Now that I sold a poem to
the <i>New Yorker,</i>

981
01:11:06,092 --> 01:11:08,788
I'm suddenly worthy of your attention?

982
01:11:08,894 --> 01:11:13,024
What's wrong with a father wanting
to hear about his son's success?

983
01:11:15,234 --> 01:11:17,225
What are those doing here?

984
01:11:18,537 --> 01:11:20,437
- He left those here last night.
- Are you working for him now?

985
01:11:20,539 --> 01:11:22,507
No. I'm not working for him.
He left it here last night.

986
01:11:22,608 --> 01:11:25,168
He left his sweater, too. Hold on.

987
01:11:29,548 --> 01:11:31,345
I thought that Chuck
was staying at his girlfriend's.

988
01:11:31,450 --> 01:11:33,418
He doesn't have a girlfriend.

989
01:11:33,519 --> 01:11:37,455
He stays here a few nights every week
to get away from you guys.

990
01:11:41,994 --> 01:11:44,690
You have no idea
what's going on, do you?

991
01:11:51,537 --> 01:11:53,971
How's your head? Douchebag.

992
01:12:02,081 --> 01:12:06,211
So dinner will be ready at 8:00,
if you're around.

993
01:12:06,318 --> 01:12:08,650
Those jeans look really great.

994
01:12:08,754 --> 01:12:12,713
And they're really snug
in all the right areas.

995
01:12:14,894 --> 01:12:17,454
Don't say things like that to me.

996
01:12:17,563 --> 01:12:19,724
- Why, I'm just...
- Just don't.

997
01:12:28,474 --> 01:12:33,138
<i>LAWRENCE: So what is the lotus?</i>
<i>Homer calls it a "honey-sweet fruit."</i>

998
01:12:33,245 --> 01:12:37,045
For Tennyson, it's not just a drug, is it?

999
01:12:37,149 --> 01:12:39,447
It symbolizes a desire
for rest and death.

1000
01:12:39,552 --> 01:12:41,452
But what does it inspire in them?

1001
01:12:41,554 --> 01:12:44,580
They're tired
and they can't take it anymore.

1002
01:12:44,690 --> 01:12:47,318
The lotus is about the
possibility of oblivion.

1003
01:12:47,426 --> 01:12:50,486
What your CliffsNotes
may not have mentioned is that

1004
01:12:50,596 --> 01:12:53,656
the eating of the lotus
occasions a song.

1005
01:12:53,766 --> 01:12:54,733
I didn't use CliffsNotes.

1006
01:12:54,834 --> 01:12:57,394
You used SparkNotes.
I read them, too.

1007
01:12:57,503 --> 01:12:59,630
So where did their singing lead them?

1008
01:12:59,839 --> 01:13:03,935
Singing lets them imagine
their way out of their misery.

1009
01:13:06,612 --> 01:13:09,604
<i>CHIN: Since they can't go home,</i>
<i>they sing of home</i>

1010
01:13:09,715 --> 01:13:12,445
<i>as the place where all the suffering is.</i>

1011
01:13:15,187 --> 01:13:17,655
<i>The song becomes the doleful music</i>

1012
01:13:17,757 --> 01:13:20,225
<i>of the miserable world</i>
<i>they no longer occupy, then</i>

1013
01:13:21,694 --> 01:13:27,189
they just sit around listening to it,
drinking nectar and stuff.

1014
01:13:46,385 --> 01:13:49,821
Hey, Lawrence, got a minute?
Can I read you something?

1015
01:13:51,190 --> 01:13:52,452
"In all my years of schooling,

1016

"Sincerely, Janet Hartigan, M.D."

1023
01:14:17,216 --> 01:14:21,209
Professor Wetherhold,
I have a simple question.

1024
01:14:21,787 --> 01:14:25,120
Why do you want to be
head of the English department?

1025
01:14:26,859 --> 01:14:28,793
I've been thinking
about that quite a bit lately.

1026
01:14:28,894 --> 01:14:31,419
As head of the department,
how do you plan on rectifying

1027
01:14:31,530 --> 01:14:34,966
the systematic subjugation
of women in this institution?

1028
01:14:35,067 --> 01:14:39,003
Julia, I haven't even vaguely
considered that, nor do I plan to.

1029
01:14:40,506 --> 01:14:44,670
You know what? None of you like me,
and I don't blame you.

1030
01:14:44,777 --> 01:14:47,439
I would make a lousy
head of the department.

1031
01:14:47,746 --> 01:14:51,910
What this department needs is
someone who likes to manage people,

1032
01:14:52,017 --> 01:14:53,848
who can make small talk.

1033
01:14:53,953 --> 01:14:55,477
And that's...

1034
01:14:56,088 --> 01:14:59,888
I can't do that.
That's not me. I can't do it.

1035
01:15:03,362 --> 01:15:05,296
Sorry I wasted your time.

1036
01:15:10,169 --> 01:15:13,400
I'll just stick to teaching for now.

1037
01:15:16,542 --> 01:15:17,509
(SIGHS)

1038
01:15:19,111 --> 01:15:23,309
So where's your girlfriend?
Been hiding out here?

1039
01:15:23,849 --> 01:15:25,214
- Bye.
- See you, Chelsea.

1040
01:15:25,317 --> 01:15:26,284
Can we talk?

1041
01:15:30,456 --> 01:15:32,924
LAWRENCE:
Everyone in my life is going crazy.

1042
01:15:34,059 --> 01:15:36,220
CHUCK:
You're the one that's crazy.

1043
01:15:36,595 --> 01:15:38,358
And socially retarded.

1044
01:15:38,998 --> 01:15:43,025
You're the middle-aged man who was
just hosting a college beer bash.

1045
01:15:46,972 --> 01:15:49,566
You know,
Vanessa's becoming an android.

1046
01:15:50,509 --> 01:15:53,603
A scary clone, no friends,

1047
01:15:55,114 --> 01:15:58,311
too scared to be anything else.
Just like you.

1048
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:03,688
And you constantly
take her for granted.

1049
01:16:03,822 --> 01:16:07,656
I do not take her for granted.
I am continually impressed by her.

1050
01:16:08,594 --> 01:16:11,688
Did you know she was
going to Stanford?

1051
01:16:11,797 --> 01:16:14,061
Early acceptance, last November.

1052
01:16:15,935 --> 01:16:18,961
- Why didn't she tell me?
- Why does she have to?

1053
01:16:21,373 --> 01:16:23,000
Why don't you ask?

1054
01:16:25,644 --> 01:16:28,374
You drove the hot doctor
out of your life.

1055
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:31,142
She left me.

1056
01:16:31,250 --> 01:16:35,050
She can't handle my success.
We're just not compatible.

1057
01:16:35,154 --> 01:16:37,520
You have the IQ of a dumb-ass ant.

1058
01:16:43,395 --> 01:16:45,886
But you know what?
Maybe it's not going to be so bad.

1059
01:16:45,998 --> 01:16:47,898
Vanessa's going away in the fall.

1060
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,401
It'll just be the two of us,
the Wetherhold bachelors.

1061
01:16:52,604 --> 01:16:57,268
Middle-aged, can't get along
with women, should be gay...

1062
01:17:11,590 --> 01:17:12,614
What are you doing here?

1063
01:17:12,858 --> 01:17:15,088
If you've come to tell me
that I can't go to Stanford,

1064
01:17:15,194 --> 01:17:16,684
then you can just forget it.

1065
01:17:16,795 --> 01:17:18,490
I don't care. I don't care if it's free.

1066
01:17:18,597 --> 01:17:20,997
I'm not going to
the same school as James.

1067
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:23,762
He sold a poem to the <i>New Yorker.</i>

1068
01:17:23,869 --> 01:17:26,394
Even cretins win the lottery sometimes.

1069
01:17:34,013 --> 01:17:37,574
I won't be head of the department.

1070
01:17:38,784 --> 01:17:42,049
- I pulled myself out of the search.
- Insane.

1071
01:17:42,988 --> 01:17:45,548
- What are you trying to do to me?
- Just relax.

1072
01:17:45,657 --> 01:17:47,284
My book,

1073
01:17:47,393 --> 01:17:50,191
that dumbed-down,
gimmicky travesty of scholarship,

1074
01:17:50,295 --> 01:17:52,195
will pay for Stanford.

1075
01:17:54,199 --> 01:17:55,530
Satisfied?

1076
01:18:03,375 --> 01:18:05,935
What's going on between
you and Chuck?

1077
01:18:08,547 --> 01:18:09,741
Nothing.

1078
01:18:11,750 --> 01:18:14,947
It's just miscommunication.

1079
01:18:16,422 --> 01:18:19,880
A simple case of middle-aged loser
trying to seduce

1080
01:18:19,992 --> 01:18:24,088
his much younger,
bound-for-success niece.

1081
01:18:27,099 --> 01:18:29,329
I don't think you're very happy,
Vanessa.

1082
01:18:31,203 --> 01:18:33,034
Well, you're not happy,

1083
01:18:35,808 --> 01:18:37,799
and you're my role model.

1084

(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

1085
01:18:53,692 --> 01:18:56,160
You know what?
I've had a monumentally shitty day.

1086
01:18:56,295 --> 01:18:58,525
You hate me. I get it.
End of discussion.

1087
01:19:06,305 --> 01:19:07,897
I don't hate you.

1088
01:19:10,909 --> 01:19:12,843
You know what? I don't really get it.

1089
01:19:13,312 --> 01:19:16,770
I don't get that you spend the first
few months trying to win me over,

1090
01:19:16,882 --> 01:19:18,213
which you do,

1091
01:19:18,317 --> 01:19:22,617
and then make up some fake girlfriend

1092
01:19:22,721 --> 01:19:24,086
and completely ditch me.

1093
01:19:25,257 --> 01:19:30,718
Well, that's not entirely
the whole story, is it?

1094
01:19:36,635 --> 01:19:38,364
Not really, I guess.

1095
01:19:44,810 --> 01:19:49,338
You know, when I moved in,
I thought you were smart and funny.

1096
01:19:50,782 --> 01:19:53,376
I'm sorry that you misunderstood that.

1097
01:19:59,358 --> 01:20:01,849
But I'll let you get back to that.

1098
01:20:02,227 --> 01:20:04,161
What are you gonna do?

1099
01:20:07,699 --> 01:20:12,261
- Go in my room. Do 1,000 pushups.
- Wow.

1100
01:20:14,139 --> 01:20:15,902
What are you going to do

Just, you know, sell phone cards?

1102
01:20:19,178 --> 01:20:20,702
Right.

1103
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:23,911
It is pretty good money.

1104
01:20:24,016 --> 01:20:26,007
- Sure.
- But I know what you mean.

1105
01:20:29,821 --> 01:20:32,085
You know, I like my life.

1106
01:20:36,929 --> 01:20:40,660
Yeah, we're like friends, I guess, right?

1107
01:20:44,703 --> 01:20:46,796
Yeah, we're friends.

1108
01:21:06,458 --> 01:21:08,756
Can you make me
something to eat, friend?

1109
01:21:08,860 --> 01:21:10,953
Order pizza, with the works.

1110
01:21:28,614 --> 01:21:32,380
Wake up! I need to run
a few errands before school.

1111
01:21:36,021 --> 01:21:37,079
Wake up.

1112
01:21:38,991 --> 01:21:41,960
<i>MAN: (SINGING)</i>
<i>If only we loved us like before</i>

1113
01:21:43,362 --> 01:21:46,126
<i>There would be more</i>

1114
01:21:47,099 --> 01:21:50,967
<i>If only the scars would disappear</i>

1115
01:21:51,069 --> 01:21:52,969
<i>Verbal surgery</i>

1116
01:21:53,071 --> 01:21:54,368
LAWRENCE: Hello.

1117
01:21:55,140 --> 01:21:59,270
<i>If only we could have seen the smoke</i>

1118
01:21:59,378 --> 01:22:01,471
<i>Simple warning</i>

1119
01:22:05,684 --> 01:22:08,084
Hold on, I want... I want that.

1120
01:22:11,857 --> 01:22:13,256
May I have a tax receipt?

1121
01:22:14,459 --> 01:22:15,426
There you go.

1122
01:22:15,861 --> 01:22:20,594
<i>Love come back save the day</i>

1123
01:22:28,573 --> 01:22:32,339
Thanks, bro. It was starting to get
a little cold out here.

1124
01:22:42,654 --> 01:22:47,023
You sat on the right side and
you didn't throw up! Good work!

1125
01:22:48,293 --> 01:22:49,692
Pull over, up here.

1126
01:22:49,795 --> 01:22:54,732
Now, remember, four words.
"I'm sorry. I love you."

1127
01:22:55,334 --> 01:22:56,426
That's five words.

1128
01:22:56,535 --> 01:22:59,595
This is no time to count words,
Professor.

1129
01:23:03,842 --> 01:23:04,809
Hey!

1130
01:23:07,179 --> 01:23:10,774
Don't forget, "I'm sorry! I love you!"

1131
01:23:15,587 --> 01:23:16,554
What'd he say?

1132
01:23:17,222 --> 01:23:21,022
MAN: I love you, too, man!
Hey, where you going!

1133
01:23:30,769 --> 01:23:32,600
- May I sit down?
- Sure.

1134
01:23:34,373 --> 01:23:37,831
- How are you?
- I'm good. How are you?

1135
01:23:37,943 --> 01:23:39,877
- I'm...
- How's the book coming?

1136
01:23:39,978 --> 01:23:41,673
Thank you for this.

1137
01:23:46,218 --> 01:23:47,845
I didn't write it.

1138
01:23:48,286 --> 01:23:49,981
You should check with Vanessa,
she does good work,

1139
01:23:50,088 --> 01:23:53,524
though the signature's not even close.

1140
01:24:00,198 --> 01:24:02,029
This is humiliating. I'll see you.

1141
01:24:02,401 --> 01:24:06,394
Wait. Wait, wait. Wait.

1142
01:24:08,774 --> 01:24:10,036
Listen,

1143
01:24:12,677 --> 01:24:15,942
I haven't had any grand epiphany

1144
01:24:16,047 --> 01:24:18,948
or made any sweeping changes
in my personality

1145
01:24:19,050 --> 01:24:21,814
over the past few weeks.

1146
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:25,351
I know I'm a miserable asshole, but

1147
01:24:27,626 --> 01:24:29,890
I do have some hope for myself.

1148
01:24:34,099 --> 01:24:35,964
Lawrence, I'm pregnant.

1149
01:24:37,702 --> 01:24:40,865
And according to my calculations,

1150
01:24:40,972 --> 01:24:43,998
this pregnancy is the result
of the first time.

1151
01:24:51,183 --> 01:24:55,313
- Well, why didn't you tell me?
- Because you were being such an ass.

1152
01:24:57,322 --> 01:25:00,985
You were not exactly
a wellspring of emotional information.

1153
01:25:06,465 --> 01:25:09,434
Why would you have a baby with me?

1154
01:25:09,534 --> 01:25:12,992
Because you don't know
how to properly use a condom.

1155
01:25:16,107 --> 01:25:17,699
Message received.

1156
01:25:30,956 --> 01:25:32,947
You're intelligent, right?

1157
01:25:34,025 --> 01:25:37,620
And you're not unattractive.

1158
01:25:42,634 --> 01:25:46,035
I mean, it's not like
it's a total genetic crapshoot.

1159
01:25:49,441 --> 01:25:51,807
Though you do have some deficits.

1160
01:25:55,380 --> 01:25:57,314
But you came here today.

1161
01:26:01,987 --> 01:26:03,887
We can figure this out.

1162
01:26:06,324 --> 01:26:08,019
We're smart people.

1163
01:26:15,367 --> 01:26:17,665
I'm sorry. I love you.

1164
01:26:25,310 --> 01:26:27,870
LAWRENCE:
It's not up to you. It's not up to me.

1165
01:26:28,914 --> 01:26:30,245
(VANESSA SIGHS)

1166
01:26:35,954 --> 01:26:39,720
- Sorry.
- Chuck, you stay, please. Just...

1167
01:26:41,593 --> 01:26:45,689
It's just that you have options.
And you should be aware of all of them.

1168
01:26:46,932 --> 01:26:49,400
Well, you have options, too, Vanessa.

1169
01:26:50,735 --> 01:26:53,169
You can either continue
to be miserable,

1170
01:26:53,271 --> 01:26:55,796
or you can just stop being
angry at everyone

1171
01:26:55,907 --> 01:26:58,501
and accept the way things are.

1172
01:26:58,610 --> 01:27:00,475
Allow yourself to live.

1173
01:27:04,115 --> 01:27:07,016
You sound like a stupid
motivational speaker.

1174
01:27:10,922 --> 01:27:12,981
You're not listening to me.

1175
01:27:14,526 --> 01:27:15,959
You're not.

1176
01:27:26,605 --> 01:27:29,096
I am not cleaning any dirty diapers.

1177
01:27:53,064 --> 01:27:54,122
<i>LAWRENCE: Morning.</i>

1178
01:27:54,232 --> 01:27:57,326
Matthew Arnold, one of the writers
we'll be studying this semester,

1179
01:27:57,435 --> 01:28:02,372
wrote that, "Culture is the pursuit
of our total perfection,

1180
01:28:02,474 --> 01:28:06,433
"the best which has been
thought and said in the world."

1181
01:28:08,346 --> 01:28:10,746
Now, my name is
Lawrence Wetherhold.

1182
01:28:10,849 --> 01:28:14,046
You may call me Professor
Wetherhold, or Dr. Wetherhold.

1183
01:28:14,152 --> 01:28:19,488
But you may not call me, "Hey, you,"
or, "Yo, Teach," or, "Dude,"

1184
01:28:20,025 --> 01:28:21,959
because none of these
terms of address

1185
01:28:22,060 --> 01:28:25,461
could possibly be the prelude
to intelligent comment or question.

1186
01:28:25,830 --> 01:28:28,298
So let's get to know one another.

1187
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:30,595
Joseph Anderson.

1188
01:28:31,670 --> 01:28:33,729
Joseph, where you from?

1189
01:28:52,123 --> 01:28:56,184
<i>(SINGING) So you got to go,</i>
