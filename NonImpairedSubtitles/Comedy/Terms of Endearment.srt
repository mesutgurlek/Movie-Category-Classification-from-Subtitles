00:21:04,328 --> 00:21:05,920
No, thank you.

339
00:21:05,996 --> 00:21:08,089
What are you afraid of?

340
00:21:08,165 --> 00:21:09,655
Afraid?

341
00:21:09,733 --> 00:21:11,257
Well,

342
00:21:12,503 --> 00:21:14,095
why not...

343
00:21:16,673 --> 00:21:19,141
Why not come on in?

344
00:21:19,209 --> 00:21:22,508
Because you're much older
than the boys I date,

345
00:21:22,579 --> 00:21:24,706
'cause you're drunk,

346
00:21:24,782 --> 00:21:28,274
and because when I went
to see an astronaut...

347
00:21:28,352 --> 00:21:29,842
give a lecture,

348
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:33,014
I didn't expect him
to prowl after us.

349
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:35,786
I didn't expect some silly flirt...

350
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:37,793
to keep his jacket open...

351
00:21:37,861 --> 00:21:40,295
because his belly's
getting too big.

352
00:21:41,999 --> 00:21:44,729
I expected a hero.

353
00:21:57,614 --> 00:22:01,607
Well, okay, Doris, don't come in.

354
00:22:01,685 --> 00:22:05,052
I don't want you in my house.

355
00:22:06,123 --> 00:22:08,853
Lee Anne, would you like
to come in?

356
00:22:08,926 --> 00:22:11,258
You better tend to that cut.

357
00:22:27,377 --> 00:22:29,811
Tommy, show me your belly.

358
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,313
Come on.

359
00:22:31,381 --> 00:22:34,817
How can you dress him like that?

360
00:22:34,885 --> 00:22:37,319
He's adorable.
Look at him.

361
00:22:38,889 --> 00:22:39,981
Oh.

362
00:22:43,393 --> 00:22:44,826
Oh, great, Tommy.

363
00:22:46,897 --> 00:22:48,330
Uh-oh.

364
00:22:48,398 --> 00:22:49,831
[Telephone Rings]

365
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,164
That's Vernon.
So tell I'm, uh...

366
00:22:52,236 --> 00:22:53,168
Out?

367
00:22:53,237 --> 00:22:54,499
[Ring]

368
00:22:54,571 --> 00:22:56,334
No. Tell him I'm resting.

369
00:22:56,406 --> 00:22:58,169
Hello.

370
00:22:58,242 --> 00:22:59,607
Hi, Flap.

371
00:23:01,345 --> 00:23:02,744
Where?

372
00:23:02,813 --> 00:23:06,305
No. Tell me now.
I want to know now.

373
00:23:13,323 --> 00:23:15,757
Oh, Flap, you didn't
expect I'd be happy.

374
00:23:15,826 --> 00:23:17,589
Let's be honest
with each other...

375
00:23:17,661 --> 00:23:19,993
before we start pretending.

376
00:23:22,366 --> 00:23:25,767
Um, look, Mom's
staring at me right now,

377
00:23:25,836 --> 00:23:29,863
so can I talk about it
later to you?

378
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:30,872
Yeah.

379
00:23:30,941 --> 00:23:32,772
All right.

380
00:23:32,843 --> 00:23:33,775
Bye.

381
00:23:46,356 --> 00:23:49,291
How long are you going
to keep this a secret?

382
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:53,295
The only school accepting Flap
for his associate professorship...

383
00:23:53,363 --> 00:23:55,797
is in Des Moines.

384
00:23:55,866 --> 00:23:58,300
He can't even do
the simple things,

385
00:23:58,368 --> 00:23:59,858
like fail locally.

386
00:24:02,306 --> 00:24:04,740
It's going to be fine, Momma.

387
00:24:04,808 --> 00:24:06,241
It's Des Moines.

388
00:24:08,312 --> 00:24:09,745
Say, "Bye-bye, house."

389
00:24:09,813 --> 00:24:11,144
Bye-bye, house.

390
00:24:17,821 --> 00:24:20,255
Be careful going down
these steps.

391
00:24:20,324 --> 00:24:21,757
Don't break your leg.

392

Come here.
Come here.

393
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:35,270
Come here.

[Rosie]
Stay sweet, honey.

395
00:24:40,544 --> 00:24:42,171
Rosie...

396
00:24:42,245 --> 00:24:45,305
Uh, that's enough, Rosie.

397
00:24:45,382 --> 00:24:46,781
They have to get started.

398
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:50,286
Tell Momma to drive you home
when you work late.

399
00:24:50,354 --> 00:24:51,651
Have some fun, Rosie.

400
00:24:51,722 --> 00:24:53,155
Don't act so brave.

401
00:24:53,223 --> 00:24:56,283
I know you'll go crazy
without me to nag.

402
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:59,227
You be good to her
or else we'll get you.

403
00:25:01,598 --> 00:25:03,190
I mean it.

404
00:25:07,104 --> 00:25:08,867
Bye, Flap.

405
00:25:08,939 --> 00:25:11,066
Have a good drive.

406
00:25:15,312 --> 00:25:17,246
Okay, fingers and toes in.

407
00:25:17,314 --> 00:25:18,747
Take Momma's purse.

408
00:25:30,127 --> 00:25:32,755
Momma, that's the first time...

409
00:25:32,829 --> 00:25:34,592
I stopped hugging first.

410
00:25:34,664 --> 00:25:36,689
I like that.

411
00:25:38,368 --> 00:25:40,893
Get yourself
a decent maternity dress.

412
00:25:40,971 --> 00:25:43,804
Had to get one in, didn't you?

413
00:25:45,142 --> 00:25:47,076
Did you tell her, Patsy?

414
00:25:47,144 --> 00:25:49,476
She keeps thinking it's me.

415
00:25:51,848 --> 00:25:52,780

416
00:25:52,849 --> 00:25:55,784
will you be good
to your mother...

417
00:25:55,852 --> 00:25:58,082
and take care of her?

418
00:25:58,155 --> 00:25:59,622
Bye, Mrs. Greenway.

00:25:59,689 --> 00:26:01,213
Good-bye.

so I'll have your address.

so I'll have your address.

enormous, you know that?

I'll miss you, Momma.

428
00:26:31,788 --> 00:26:33,722
Can we go now?

429
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:35,724
Yeah. Pull away slow.

You don't know
how lucky you are.

Everybody wants to go
to Des Moines.

436
00:27:25,308 --> 00:27:28,744
People come to get
one look at Des Moines...

437
00:27:28,812 --> 00:27:30,245
before they die.

438
00:27:30,313 --> 00:27:34,750
Some people say
it's the best city in Iowa.

00:27:34,818 --> 00:27:36,752
I know you're teasing me.

440
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,754
Texas is the best!

441
00:27:39,956 --> 00:27:42,720
I think you should stop worrying.

442
00:27:42,792 --> 00:27:45,226
You'll see some
terrific new things.

Hey, you in the bush,
I can't hear you.

You're ignoring me
when I speak?

What am I supposed to say?

460
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:58,233
It's hard not to yell...

00:28:58,301 --> 00:29:00,565
when you hit cold water.

462
00:29:00,637 --> 00:29:02,832
Hey, uh, come here.

00:29:06,076 --> 00:29:07,509

00:29:11,981 --> 00:29:12,913
Yes.

00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:16,775
You-You want a shock?

468
00:29:16,853 --> 00:29:19,014
No, not especially.

469
00:29:19,089 --> 00:29:20,078
What?

470
00:29:22,258 --> 00:29:27,696
Well, we're going to have this...

471
00:29:27,764 --> 00:29:29,197
dinner at, uh...

472
00:29:29,265 --> 00:29:32,200
NASA dinner at the White House.

473
00:29:32,268 --> 00:29:36,705
You know, some cosmonauts,
and all of us...

474
00:29:36,773 --> 00:29:39,241
I didn't know
who I could take.

475
00:29:39,309 --> 00:29:42,244
All the people I flew with,

476
00:29:42,312 --> 00:29:46,248
their wives are giving me
bitch bites all over my back...

477
00:29:46,316 --> 00:29:49,251
if I show up
with one of my regular girls.

478
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:51,310
I didn't know
anybody old enough,

479
00:29:51,387 --> 00:29:56,518
so I thought, "Well, I'll ask
my next-door neighbor."

480
00:29:59,295 --> 00:30:02,230
Well, anyway, they
canceled the dinner,

481
00:30:02,298 --> 00:30:06,667
but I was really thinking
about asking you out.

482
00:30:06,736 --> 00:30:07,828
Seriously.

483
00:30:07,904 --> 00:30:10,566
Ain't that a shocker?

484
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,073
Yes.

485
00:30:12,142 --> 00:30:15,578
Imagine you having a date
with someone...

486
00:30:15,645 --> 00:30:18,512
where it wasn't necessarily
a felony.

487
00:30:23,353 --> 00:30:26,789
What would you have said
if I asked you?

488
00:30:26,856 --> 00:30:28,790
Seriously.

489
00:30:31,995 --> 00:30:35,453
I would've said I'd like
to see the White House.

490
00:30:35,532 --> 00:30:38,000
So you would've come.

491
00:30:39,903 --> 00:30:41,268
What the hell.

492
00:30:41,337 --> 00:30:44,306
You want to have dinner
out sometime?

493
00:30:44,374 --> 00:30:45,807
No, thank you.

494
00:30:45,875 --> 00:30:47,536
What about lunch?

495
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:51,273
You ladies, you like
to have lunch a lot.

496
00:30:51,347 --> 00:30:54,316
There's something
about your manner.

497
00:30:55,885 --> 00:30:59,912
It's like you're trying
to toy with me.

498
00:31:01,491 --> 00:31:04,255
That's right, Aurora.
I'm playing with you.

499
00:31:04,327 --> 00:31:05,760
This is the element.

500
00:31:05,828 --> 00:31:08,262
Do you want to play, Aurora?

501
00:31:08,331 --> 00:31:10,629
Want to have lunch?

502
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,066
We'll have lunch.

503
00:31:14,337 --> 00:31:17,272
If you want to have lunch
in some restaurant...

504
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:20,275
to improve the atmosphere
in this neighborhood,

505
00:31:20,343 --> 00:31:22,072
I wouldn't exactly say no.

506
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,272
Come here.

507
00:31:25,348 --> 00:31:28,283
We're too far apart to talk.

508
00:31:39,862 --> 00:31:41,124
Now,

509
00:31:41,197 --> 00:31:42,289
Aurora,

510
00:31:44,534 --> 00:31:47,298
since you've agreed,

511
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:51,306
why don't we just
forget about the rest?

512
00:31:51,374 --> 00:31:54,810
I mean, I know how you feel.

513
00:31:54,877 --> 00:31:58,813
There were countdowns
when I had my doubts.

514
00:31:58,881 --> 00:32:00,746
I said to myself,

515
00:32:00,817 --> 00:32:03,251
"You agreed to do it.

516
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:04,911
"You're strapped in,

517
00:32:04,988 --> 00:32:07,422
"and you're in the hands...

518
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:12,052
"of something bigger and
more powerful than yourself.

519
00:32:12,128 --> 00:32:16,064
"So, uh, why don't you just...

520
00:32:16,132 --> 00:32:20,091
lay back and enjoy the ride?"

521
00:32:20,169 --> 00:32:21,602
I'm not going.

522
00:32:21,671 --> 00:32:23,605
There's something
wrong with you.

523
00:32:28,845 --> 00:32:31,279
Oh, God.
I'm such a shit.

524
00:32:36,853 --> 00:32:39,287
[Flap]
Wait! That must be it.

525
00:32:39,355 --> 00:32:41,289
[Emma]
Right there? Oh, God!

526
00:32:41,357 --> 00:32:44,793
Flap, it's great.
Is that it, really?

527
00:32:44,861 --> 00:32:46,294
Oh, it's great.

528
00:32:46,362 --> 00:32:47,693
Isn't that sweet?

529
00:32:49,866 --> 00:32:51,800
Oh, that was a bump.

530
00:32:51,868 --> 00:32:53,301
Oh, yeah.

531
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:55,803
What is that?

532
00:32:55,872 --> 00:32:58,306
Shall we go see the house?

533
00:32:58,374 --> 00:32:59,739
You stay there.

534
00:32:59,809 --> 00:33:02,279
Come on.
Let's get this off.

535
00:33:03,813 --> 00:33:05,246
Come on.

536
00:33:06,316 --> 00:33:08,250
Whoa! Come on.

537
00:33:11,321 --> 00:33:13,755
Oh, sweetheart,
did you hurt yourself?

538
00:33:13,823 --> 00:33:14,755
Nope, not yet.

539
00:33:14,824 --> 00:33:16,758
Do you like it?

540
00:33:16,826 --> 00:33:19,260
Do you like it?

541
00:33:19,329 --> 00:33:21,263
Oh, it's great.

542
00:33:21,331 --> 00:33:23,265
Flap, it's great.

543
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:24,766
Oh, my God.

544
00:33:26,336 --> 00:33:27,769
Oh.

545
00:33:27,837 --> 00:33:28,769
Oh!

546
00:33:39,683 --> 00:33:43,517
Leave the mattress here.
We can sleep here.

547
00:33:49,459 --> 00:33:51,290
I'm really tired.

548
00:33:59,969 --> 00:34:01,402
Ow! Ow!

549
00:34:08,812 --> 00:34:11,406
You ever made love in Iowa?

550
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:20,256
Tommy's room is on
the other side of the hall,

551
00:34:20,323 --> 00:34:22,257
so we can get noisy.

552
00:34:22,325 --> 00:34:26,261
Good. You get to make
your little high-pitched squeak.

553
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:28,763
Oh! Oh! Oh!

554
00:34:28,832 --> 00:34:31,096
Flap, what about you?

555
00:34:31,167 --> 00:34:33,101
What about you?

556
00:34:33,169 --> 00:34:34,602
Here I come.

557
00:34:34,671 --> 00:34:36,434
Here I come again.

558
00:34:36,506 --> 00:34:38,269
Yes! Yes!

559
00:34:38,341 --> 00:34:39,774
Yes!

560
00:34:41,344 --> 00:34:43,938
Here I come again.

561
00:34:44,013 --> 00:34:46,277
Yes.

Yes.

Yes.

Oh, God.

565
00:34:53,022 --> 00:34:55,456
You just made me wet.

566
00:34:55,525 --> 00:34:58,892
How can you do that
with your voice?

567
00:34:58,962 --> 00:35:01,726
You just make
your voice like that.

568
00:35:01,798 --> 00:35:04,232
If Tommy can't hear us,

569
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,234
we can't hear Tommy.

570
00:35:09,305 --> 00:35:10,897
He's fine, Mother.

571
00:35:10,974 --> 00:35:13,909
Don't get pissy.
I'll be right back.

583
00:35:46,342 --> 00:35:48,776
This isn't love, it's selfishness.

584
00:35:48,845 --> 00:35:52,781
It's been a week
since we've been together.

585
00:35:52,849 --> 00:35:55,283
We've never gone a week.

586
00:35:55,351 --> 00:35:56,784
Sure, we have.

587
00:35:56,853 --> 00:35:59,185
Only in the real pregnant months.

588
00:35:59,255 --> 00:36:01,723
You're always getting home late.

589
00:36:01,791 --> 00:36:03,725
Do me a favor.

590
00:36:03,793 --> 00:36:06,227
Don't make me feel silly,

591
00:36:06,296 --> 00:36:09,060
I won't make you feel guilty.

592
00:36:09,132 --> 00:36:10,565
Fair enough.

593
00:36:10,633 --> 00:36:12,396
I have to hurry.

594
00:36:12,469 --> 00:36:14,733

I love that you came back.

will be ready in a minute.

Hurry. I've got
to grade those papers.

Hi, Mother.
Could we talk later?

I've got to get the boys off.

Don't be so inconsiderate.

Stop right here.
Tell me what it is.

Okay, Mother.
I need some money.

00:38:08,785 --> 00:38:11,185
I need you
to loan me some money.

I really need it, so will you?

Oh, Mother, please don't be quiet.

You know that was hard for me.

623
00:38:19,295 --> 00:38:22,389
You can say no,
but please don't be quiet.

624
00:38:22,465 --> 00:38:24,433
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetheart.

625
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,367
I was just thinking.

626
00:38:27,437 --> 00:38:28,836
Thinking what?

627
00:38:28,905 --> 00:38:32,500
How much I hate
to part with money.

628
00:38:32,575 --> 00:38:35,009
I wouldn't have asked if...

629
00:38:35,078 --> 00:38:36,136
Don't yell,

630
00:38:36,212 --> 00:38:39,010
but I think that
I may be pregnant again.

631
00:38:39,082 --> 00:38:41,744
Oh! No!

632
00:38:41,818 --> 00:38:46,084
And you're going
to have it, I suppose.

00:38:46,155 --> 00:38:48,089
Yes, of course.

634

What's happening to you, anyway?

635

Don't act like that's so terrible.

Simple?

638
00:38:58,234 --> 00:39:00,600
Then they get wonderful jobs.

639
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:02,570
You can have it in Colorado.

640
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:04,573
Why do I tell you anything?

641
00:39:04,641 --> 00:39:06,336
I like you less and less.

You know why, Emma?

It's because only I
tell you the truth.

Go get dressed.

to rescue you?

Give me the painting to sell.

650

No! That's your security.

651
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:35,569
I will not have you
using that for rent.

652

All right?

I'll talk to you later, all right?

655
00:39:45,815 --> 00:39:49,512
All right.
If the money would mean...

656
00:39:49,585 --> 00:39:52,383
No, don't. It would
make you crazy.

657
00:39:53,589 --> 00:39:54,954
Yes, it would.

I'm not doing anything.

Oh, yes, you are.

What's the subject?

677
00:41:17,172 --> 00:41:19,766
That I'm on to you.

678
00:41:19,841 --> 00:41:22,275
You wouldn't look so innocent...

679
00:41:22,344 --> 00:41:24,278
unless you were guilty.

680
00:41:24,346 --> 00:41:27,281
You'll have to
take my word for it.

681

You have no other choice.

No, no, no.
No, no, no!

Whoa!

Excuse me.

Emma, you always
get a little paranoid...

00:41:46,701 --> 00:41:49,636
in your first few months, okay?

687
00:41:49,704 --> 00:41:50,966
Just...

688
00:41:54,342 --> 00:41:56,310
If you are doing something...

689
00:41:56,378 --> 00:41:59,438
and trying to make me
feel crazy because I'm pregnant,

690
00:41:59,514 --> 00:42:02,483
you may have sunk so low...

00:42:02,551 --> 00:42:03,984
you'll never recover.

692
00:42:04,052 --> 00:42:06,486
You may have just panicked,

693
00:42:06,555 --> 00:42:08,989
and trying to save yourself,

694
00:42:09,057 --> 00:42:11,491
you've thrown out
your character and principles.

695
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,996
The only way you could
redeem yourself...

696
00:42:15,063 --> 00:42:16,997
is to admit anything...

697
00:42:17,065 --> 00:42:21,024
that you might have
been doing last night.

698

If you don't do that,

699
00:42:23,138 --> 00:42:25,606
you are a lost man.

It's a great day
when you get tenure!

All tenure means...

is we won't have
enough money forever!

715

Why won't you ask your mother?

I'll pay you back tomorrow.

You're a very rude young woman.

treating customers so badly.

I don't think I was
treating her badly.

Be careful!

00:47:02,283 --> 00:47:03,215
Right here.

That was worst time I've ever had.

Oh, no thanks required.

807

I've had a lovely time.

808
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:49,990
Me, too.
I'll get the money back to you.

809
00:47:50,065 --> 00:47:53,125
You can drop it
in the mail, if you like.

810
00:47:53,201 --> 00:47:55,465
To the bank?

811
00:47:55,537 --> 00:48:00,497
Sure. You could even use
a check-by-mail envelope.

Or, uh, you could come in.
Whichever.

Maybe I'll come in sometime.

814
00:48:09,584 --> 00:48:11,711
Well, that'd be fine.

815
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,224
Can I help you with that?

816
00:48:21,296 --> 00:48:23,890
No, thanks.
I'm used to this.

You're the best.

824

Do you want one, Vernon?

Would you like a kiss?

829
00:49:00,435 --> 00:49:04,838
You're not lying
about your age, are you?

830
00:49:04,906 --> 00:49:06,339
Of course not.

831
00:49:06,407 --> 00:49:08,841
I thought you were 52.

832
00:49:08,910 --> 00:49:13,313
How do you expect
to fool a family doctor?

833

She said her age.

834
00:49:15,416 --> 00:49:17,350
The number doesn't matter,

835
00:49:17,418 --> 00:49:19,352
but its concealment does.

Why does he keep talking?
