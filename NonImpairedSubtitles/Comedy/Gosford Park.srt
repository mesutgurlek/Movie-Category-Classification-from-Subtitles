yourhusbandis with our Hollywood folk.

151
00:12:21,168 --> 00:12:23,329
well,
you know Raymond.

152
00:12:23,403 --> 00:12:25,735
He only feels safe
with his own kind.

153
00:12:25,806 --> 00:12:27,865
Bill!
[ Chuckles ]

154
00:12:31,077 --> 00:12:34,012
I thought ladies'maids
never wore aprons.

155
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:37,072
Her Ladyship used to have a French maid
who wore a black one like this.

156
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,141
she thinks it's got
a bit of style.

157
00:12:39,219 --> 00:12:42,279
I bet she does, and I bet
she took it out ofyour wages too.

158
00:12:42,355 --> 00:12:45,188
she likes to have
everything just so.

159
00:12:45,258 --> 00:12:47,192
Mmm.
Don't they all.

160
00:12:48,728 --> 00:12:51,128
- That's him.
- who?.

161
00:12:51,198 --> 00:12:53,132
Ivor Novello.

162
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,533
He passed us on the road today
on his way here, and he spoke to me.

163
00:12:56,603 --> 00:13:00,061
well, he spoke to Her Ladyship,
but I answered.

164
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,075
I only cut it out for Garbo.
I prefer the American stars.

165
00:13:03,143 --> 00:13:05,304
I think they've got
more oomph.

166
00:13:05,378 --> 00:13:07,744
Go on!

167
00:13:07,814 --> 00:13:10,647
- Is he really sirwilliam's cousin?.
- yep.

168
00:13:10,717 --> 00:13:12,981
Imagine having a film star
in the family.

169
00:13:13,053 --> 00:13:16,648
- Ladysylvia must be thrilled.
- Oh, I don't think.

170
00:13:16,723 --> 00:13:18,657
whywouldn't she be?.

171
00:13:18,725 --> 00:13:20,693
'Cause she's a snobbish cow.
'Cause she--

172
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,127
she looks down on anyone who got
to the top with brains and hard work.

173
00:13:24,197 --> 00:13:26,927
just like she looks down on her husband,
except when it's time to foot the bills.

174
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,025
And then she's got
her hand out, all right.

175
00:13:29,102 --> 00:13:32,162
- what was her family, then?
- what'd you expect, really?.

176
00:13:32,239 --> 00:13:34,571
Toffee-nosed and useless.

177
00:13:34,641 --> 00:13:36,575
Her father was
the Earl of Carton.

178
00:13:36,643 --> 00:13:38,804
sounds good, except
he didn't have a pot to piss in.

179
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:41,177
what's she like
to work for?.

180
00:13:41,248 --> 00:13:44,775
she's horrible.
But he's--

181
00:13:44,851 --> 00:13:47,046
He's okay. Come on.
we better get cracking.

182
00:13:50,223 --> 00:13:53,021
- Hello, I'm Ivor.
- I know who you are.

183
00:13:53,093 --> 00:13:55,857
- Mabel Nesbitt.
- Hello, Mabel.

184
00:13:55,929 --> 00:13:58,955
-[Mabel] Howareyou?
- Very well, thankyou.

185
00:14:01,601 --> 00:14:04,297
Oh! I don't smoke.
Thankyou.

186
00:14:04,371 --> 00:14:06,635
[Elsie ] Mrs. Nesbitt's
only got one dress with her.

187
00:14:06,706 --> 00:14:09,072
says her husband rushed her
when she was packing.

188
00:14:09,142 --> 00:14:11,633
Do you always look after visitors
if they haven't got a maid?.

189
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,645
sometimes Dorothy helps,
though why Mrs. wilson...

190
00:14:13,713 --> 00:14:16,113
makes the still room maid
do it beats me.

191
00:14:16,182 --> 00:14:18,207
I think she only does it
to annoy Mrs. Croft.

192
00:14:18,285 --> 00:14:21,812
- which one does Dorothy answer to?.
- Both. That's the problem.

193
00:14:21,888 --> 00:14:24,049
she's rushed offher feet as it is.
Areyou nearly done there?.

194
00:14:24,124 --> 00:14:26,957
- yes.
- Here she is-- Miss Bossy.

195
00:14:27,027 --> 00:14:28,995
Tell me, what was Greta Garbo
really like?.

196
00:14:29,062 --> 00:14:32,657
- Didyou get to knowher?
-[Novello ] yes, I did, actually.

197
00:14:32,732 --> 00:14:35,462
she's coming to stay
with me next month.

198
00:14:35,535 --> 00:14:38,265
[ Gasps ]

199
00:14:38,338 --> 00:14:42,240
Tell me, howmuch longer areyou
going to go on... making films?

200
00:14:42,309 --> 00:14:46,211
I suppose that rather depends
on how much longer the public
want to see me in them.

201
00:14:47,447 --> 00:14:49,381
yes, it must be hard
to know...

202
00:14:49,449 --> 00:14:52,043
when it's time
to throw in the towel.

203
00:14:52,118 --> 00:14:55,679
what a pity about
that last one ofyours.

204
00:14:55,755 --> 00:14:58,189
what-what was it called?.

205
00:14:58,258 --> 00:15:01,421
- The Dodger.
- The Lodger.

206
00:15:01,494 --> 00:15:03,860
The Lodger.

207
00:15:05,231 --> 00:15:07,495
And it must be
so disappointing...

208
00:15:07,567 --> 00:15:10,400
when something just, you know,
flops like that.

209
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,064
yes, it is...

210
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:15,573
rather disappointing.

211
00:15:15,642 --> 00:15:18,475
Look at this.
Machine-made lace.

212
00:15:18,545 --> 00:15:20,979
- Hark at her.
- well, I hate cheap clothes.

213
00:15:21,047 --> 00:15:23,982
They're twice the work,
and they never look as good.

214
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:28,009
I'll murder that dog one day.
Look at that. All over his waistcoat.

215
00:15:28,088 --> 00:15:30,921
what doyou expect from a woman
without her own maid?.

216
00:15:30,991 --> 00:15:35,223
Lady Lavinia says a woman who travels
with no maid has lost her self-respect.

217
00:15:35,295 --> 00:15:39,129
- she calls it ""giving in."
- I don't have a maid.
I haven't given in.

218
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,463
- [Sarah] That's different.
-[Elsie ] why?

219
00:15:41,534 --> 00:15:45,197
- what's your name?.
- I think here I'm called Trentham.

220
00:15:45,271 --> 00:15:48,035
No, I meantyour real name.

221

Oh. Mary.

well, sheshouldcall me Maceachran,
now I'm a lady's maid.

224

That's what my mother says.

225
00:16:00,687 --> 00:16:03,781
But Her Ladyship can't pronounce it,
so she calls me Mary.

226
00:16:03,857 --> 00:16:05,791
I don't blame her.

There mustn't be anymore nonsense.

- yeah. Bores me stiff.

- All right, Pip.
- I just wondered--

[Sylvia ]
william's such a rotten shot.

240
00:16:42,929 --> 00:16:45,420
I usually try and duck out ofit,
particularly in Scotland.

241
00:16:45,498 --> 00:16:47,466
I 'm rather fond
of scotland.

242

All right,
get on with your work. yes?.

243
00:16:51,337 --> 00:16:54,465
- Ah, Mr. weissman. There you are.
- I'm dealing with this.

244
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:58,773
- what is it, Mr. weissman?.
- well, to start with,
my name is Denton.

245
00:16:58,845 --> 00:17:01,746
- Henry Denton.
- you're here as valet to Mr. weissman.

246
00:17:01,815 --> 00:17:05,911
That means you'll be known
as Mr. weissman below stairs
for the duration ofyour stay.

247
00:17:05,985 --> 00:17:09,716
we stick to the old customs here.
It saves confusion.

248
00:17:09,789 --> 00:17:11,882
- It's about Mr. weissman's diet.
- yes?.

249
00:17:13,226 --> 00:17:15,558
He's a vegetarian.

250
00:17:15,628 --> 00:17:18,119
- A what?.
- A vegetarian.

251
00:17:18,198 --> 00:17:22,328
He doesn't eat meat.
He eats fish, but not meat.

252
00:17:23,636 --> 00:17:27,128
well, I never!
Doesn't eat meat?.

253
00:17:27,207 --> 00:17:29,971
He's coming for a shooting party,
and he doesn't eat meat.

254

Mr. weissman doesn't
intend to shoot.

255
00:17:32,645 --> 00:17:36,172
I think he just wants to walk
out with them, get a bit of air.

256
00:17:36,249 --> 00:17:38,183
Get a bit of air?.

00:17:38,251 --> 00:17:40,549

Now I suggestyou get one of

Mr. weissman is in

He's very full ofhimself, I must say.
""Doesn't eat meat."

264

Now, now, Mrs. Croft. we don't want
to be thought unsophisticated, do we?.

00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:08,074
Mr. weissman's an American.
They do things differently there.

He has this ridiculous idea...

270
00:18:19,692 --> 00:18:21,956
that Americans all sleep
with guns under their pillows.

271
00:18:22,028 --> 00:18:24,861
They do, but they're more for
each otherthan for killing birds.

How areyou related towilliam exactly?.

I ever met william's mother.

rather original?.

She always finds
such wonderful servants.

I don't know how she manages.

00:18:51,858 --> 00:18:53,792
I 'm breaking in
a new maid.

282
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,919
I 'm simply worn out
with it.

283

Actually, there's nothing
more exhausting, is there?.

- I don't have a lady's maid.
- Oh. Hello.

285
00:19:02,635 --> 00:19:05,604
I was just telling dear Mabel here
about my new maid.

286
00:19:05,672 --> 00:19:09,233
Honestly, the amount I have to do
for her, she should be paying me.

287
00:19:09,309 --> 00:19:11,368
she does seem
ratheryoung.

288
00:19:11,444 --> 00:19:15,073
well, ofcourse, whatshe is,
my dear, is wonderfully cheap.

289
00:19:15,148 --> 00:19:17,275
you've no right to pull me away
in mid-conversation.

290
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:20,046
Mabel, where are you going?.
The room's this way.

291
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:22,212
why the hell did you have to mention
you don't have a maid?.

292
00:19:22,288 --> 00:19:24,984
why would you mention you didn't
have a maid, for God's sake?.

293
00:19:36,035 --> 00:19:39,630
you'd find it a lot easier to clean
them ifyou put the trees in first.

294
00:19:39,706 --> 00:19:41,640
I was just about
to do that.

295
00:19:43,843 --> 00:19:45,868
Are these
Mr. Novello's shoes?.

296
00:19:45,945 --> 00:19:47,879
yes.

297
00:19:56,289 --> 00:19:59,190
- Doyou really live in Hollywood?.
- I do.

298
00:19:59,259 --> 00:20:02,251
Hmm. How did you get there?.
where did you start from?.

299
00:20:02,328 --> 00:20:05,525
where else doyou think?.
scotland.

300
00:20:05,598 --> 00:20:07,532
wereyou always
in service?.

301
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,831
Did you ever think oftrying to
get into films whileyou were there?.

302
00:20:10,903 --> 00:20:14,532
I wanted to be an actor once...
when I was little.

303
00:20:14,607 --> 00:20:18,737
I suppose
old MotherTrentham...

304
00:20:18,811 --> 00:20:21,371
will have her begging bowl out
while she's here.

305
00:20:21,447 --> 00:20:23,915
she won't be bothering
your employers, that's certain.

306
00:20:23,983 --> 00:20:26,747
- why not?.
- [Elsie ]
Because Lady Lavinia Meredith...

307
00:20:26,819 --> 00:20:29,845
- hasn't got a penny
to bless herselfwith.
- And whose fault is that?.

308
00:20:29,922 --> 00:20:31,890
There's nothing wrong
with the commander.

309
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,051
He's just been a bit
unfortunate.

310
00:20:34,127 --> 00:20:36,857
I'll say.
I think he's pathetic.

311
00:20:36,929 --> 00:20:39,523
Then why don'tyou
hand in your notice?.

312
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:42,033
well, the other two sisters
fell on their feet.

313
00:20:42,101 --> 00:20:44,035
Of course, it helps
that they're both good-looking.

314
00:20:44,103 --> 00:20:46,571
- [Mary] LadySylvia's lovely.
- you think so?.

315
00:20:46,639 --> 00:20:49,540
- She might have done a bit
better for herself, really.
-[Elsie ] I begyourpardon.

316
00:20:49,609 --> 00:20:52,635
Lord Carton was determined to have sir
william for either of the two eldest.

317
00:20:52,712 --> 00:20:54,646
I was told he could have
had his pick.

318
00:20:54,714 --> 00:20:57,683
- why was Lord Carton so keen?.
- why do you think?.

319
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:01,982
who do you suppose pays
for him to swan around Biarritz
for six months of the year?.

320
00:21:02,055 --> 00:21:05,616
Come to that, who keeps Ma Trentham
in stockings and gin?

321
00:21:05,692 --> 00:21:09,753
- Old money bags, that's who.
- I think it's disgusting
the way they all use him.

322
00:21:09,829 --> 00:21:12,992
None of the rest of them
have got the brains to make
the price of a packet oftea.

323
00:21:13,066 --> 00:21:16,035
- Areyou finished, Elsie?.
- yes, Mrs. wilson.

324
00:21:16,102 --> 00:21:18,969
- I'vejust got this hem to do.
- what's Lord stockbridge like?.

325
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:21,529
He thinks
he's God Almighty.

326
00:21:21,607 --> 00:21:23,541
They all do.

327
00:21:40,026 --> 00:21:43,553
- why does this fork go on the right?.
- [ Chuckles ]

328
00:21:43,629 --> 00:21:46,564
Because they eat the fish
with two ofthem.

329
00:21:46,632 --> 00:21:50,261
- One in each hand.
- why is that, then?.

330
00:21:50,336 --> 00:21:53,499
- search me.
- [ George ] what areyou doing here?

331
00:21:53,573 --> 00:21:57,304
-J ust looking around.
- Mr.Jennings will be up in a minute.

332
00:21:57,377 --> 00:22:00,312
If I were you,
I'd go and look around somewhere else.

333
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:03,816
- Is that what you'd do?.
- That's exactlywhat I would do.

334
00:22:03,883 --> 00:22:05,817
Then that's what
I'll do.

335
00:22:08,488 --> 00:22:11,321
- something funny about that bloke.
- His accent for a start.

336
00:22:11,391 --> 00:22:13,655
- what doyou think his game is?.
- I don't know.

337
00:22:13,726 --> 00:22:18,220
Areyou finished?. what about
Lord Rupert standish and Mr. Blond?.

338
00:22:18,297 --> 00:22:21,164
Her Ladyship said
not to wait for them.

339
00:22:21,234 --> 00:22:23,168
The stuffs all ready
ifthey turn up on time.

340
00:22:23,236 --> 00:22:25,466
we can stick on
two extra places in a jiffy.

341
00:22:25,538 --> 00:22:29,440
when they arrive, you'll be
dressing Mr. Blond, Arthur.

342
00:22:29,509 --> 00:22:31,943
- Mr. Blond?.
- yes, Mr. Blond.

343
00:22:32,011 --> 00:22:34,445
George, you'll have
Lord Rupert.

344
00:22:34,514 --> 00:22:36,846
Ifthey're very late,
they can change by themselves,

345
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:38,884
and you can tidy up
when they're downstairs.

346
00:22:38,951 --> 00:22:40,885
Is Mr. Nesbitt
settled?.

347
00:22:40,953 --> 00:22:42,978
I'll go and finish
him off now, sir.

348
00:22:43,055 --> 00:22:47,515
- And Mr. Novello?.
- Mr. weissman's man will attend to him.

349
00:22:48,828 --> 00:22:51,456
Right.
Afteryou're finished,

350
00:22:51,531 --> 00:22:53,624
join me in the drawing room
with the drinks.

351
00:22:57,437 --> 00:23:00,133
- what's the matterwith you?.
- Nothing.

352
00:23:01,574 --> 00:23:04,270
Only I thought I'd be doing
Mr. Novello, that's all.

353
00:23:04,343 --> 00:23:06,504
Nowyou won't get to see him
in his underdrawers.

354
00:23:06,579 --> 00:23:08,945
Never mind.
Better luck next time.

355
00:23:13,886 --> 00:23:16,150
They're rather
a mixed bunch.

356
00:23:16,222 --> 00:23:18,190
That Mr. weissman's
very odd.

357
00:23:18,257 --> 00:23:20,748
Apparently, he produces
motion pictures.

358
00:23:20,827 --> 00:23:24,490
The Charlie Chan mysteries.
Or does he direct them?.

359
00:23:24,564 --> 00:23:26,828
I never know the difference.

360
00:23:26,899 --> 00:23:29,891
Really?.
I enjoy those, milady.

361
00:23:29,969 --> 00:23:31,903
ye-- Mary.

362
00:23:31,971 --> 00:23:34,201
I suppose it's fun
having a film star staying.

363
00:23:34,273 --> 00:23:39,802
There's always so little to talk about
after the first flush of recognition.

364
00:23:39,879 --> 00:23:43,713
And why has Freddie Nesbitt brought
that awful, common little wife ofhis?.

365
00:23:43,783 --> 00:23:47,219
I mean, Isobel onlyaskedhim
because a gun dropped out.

366
00:23:47,286 --> 00:23:49,948
That's no excuse
to inflict her on us all.

367
00:23:50,022 --> 00:23:52,752
Mary!.
[Sighs ]

368
00:23:52,825 --> 00:23:55,259
so what's the gossip
in the servants' hall?.

369
00:23:55,328 --> 00:23:58,889
- Um, nothing, milady.
- Hmm?.

370
00:23:58,965 --> 00:24:01,195
Nonsense.
Come on. Out with it.

371
00:24:02,468 --> 00:24:04,766
well, is it true
that sirwilliam...

372
00:24:04,837 --> 00:24:08,295
could have married Ladystockbridge
ifhe'd wanted to?.

373
00:24:10,109 --> 00:24:12,339
Is that what
they're saying?

374
00:24:12,411 --> 00:24:15,869
Only that Lord Carton was
after sirwilliam for one ofthem,

375
00:24:15,948 --> 00:24:17,882
but he didn't care which.

376
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:21,147
what would you say
if I told you...

377
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:23,518
they cut cards for him?.

378
00:24:24,724 --> 00:24:27,158
william, Lewis said
you wanted me.

379
00:24:27,226 --> 00:24:29,421
- who's next to me at dinner?.
- Oh, you know.

380
00:24:29,495 --> 00:24:31,429
Aunt Constance
and Lavinia.

381
00:24:31,497 --> 00:24:33,692
why do I have to have
that bloody old trout all the time?.

382
00:24:33,766 --> 00:24:37,497
- I want Louisa.
- Do I have to explain
the table ofprecedence again?

383
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:40,403
- I don't give a shit about precedence.
- well,you always complain...

384
00:24:40,473 --> 00:24:42,805
that people look down on you,
and then you behave like a peasant.

385
00:24:42,875 --> 00:24:45,343
Now, tomorrow morning,
I 'll--

386
00:24:45,411 --> 00:24:48,175
I 'll breakfast in bed,

387
00:24:48,247 --> 00:24:50,181
and then get straight up
into the tweeds.

388
00:24:50,249 --> 00:24:52,183
what shirt
have you brought?.

389
00:24:52,251 --> 00:24:54,879
Um, the green
with the pink stripe.

390
00:24:54,954 --> 00:24:57,787
Oh, no, dear. No.
That's quite wrong.

391
00:24:57,857 --> 00:25:00,519
No, always something
veryplain for countrysports.

392
00:25:00,593 --> 00:25:03,494
The one I had on today
will do.

393
00:25:03,563 --> 00:25:07,192
- But it's soi led.
- yeah, well, you can wash it,
can'tyou?

394
00:25:09,402 --> 00:25:12,030
God. I hate shooti ng.

395
00:25:13,806 --> 00:25:16,468
why does one
have to do these things?.

396
00:25:16,542 --> 00:25:18,806
[ McCordle ]
Has Constance asked for moneyyet?

397
00:25:18,878 --> 00:25:20,812
- No.
- Raymond tells me...

398
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,974
she's been complaining that
her allowance isn't big enough.

399
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:25,950
Good mind to stop it
completely.

400
00:25:26,018 --> 00:25:28,646
- I thought it was for her lifetime.
- [Laughs ]

401
00:25:28,721 --> 00:25:30,689
No, no.

402
00:25:33,426 --> 00:25:35,951
- will that be all, sir?.
- Mmm.

403
00:25:36,028 --> 00:25:38,326
I do wish thatAnthony
wasn't here.

404
00:25:38,397 --> 00:25:40,331
Make sure I'm not
left alone with him, willyou?

405
00:25:40,399 --> 00:25:43,061
- [Sylvia ] why?
- I'm pulling out of his scheme.

406
00:25:43,135 --> 00:25:45,399
Oh.
Have you told him?.

407
00:25:45,471 --> 00:25:47,405
No, and I'm not
going to either.

408
00:25:47,473 --> 00:25:50,408
Louisa said I should leave it
till next week.

409
00:25:50,476 --> 00:25:52,740
Let him sob in private.

Go. say hello to your mommy.
Go on.

411
00:25:55,781 --> 00:25:57,874
Far be it from me
to contradict Louisa.

- will there be anything else?.
-Just get Pip.
He might fall down the stairs.

Hey, hey, come here.

Thankyou, Elsie.
you keep hold ofhim.

- Cheap dress, wrong shoes.

Mr. Probert, really.

- you don't have any
spare hairpins, doyou?.
- yeah.

419
00:26:18,771 --> 00:26:21,763
I'm trying to get back to the room
for a second, and I can't find it.

420
00:26:21,841 --> 00:26:23,775
It's the staircase
at the end ofthe corridor.

- yes.

nothinggoing on between me and Isobel.

Can't you just tell me the truth?.
you're a liar, Freddie.

- There is nothing--
- you are a liar!

- Don't you call me a liar!

A little something I'm working on.

ever goes about inventing a tune.

where do you start?.

It's rather difficult
to say.

you're too clever forwords.

to put up with these people?.

you know, I really enjoy the way
you do things, Mr.Jennings.

I beg your pardon?.

- what is it, Henry?.
- Nothing.

I just wanted to be sure
you had everything you need, sir.

yes, I do.
Thankyou.

00:29:25,357 --> 00:29:28,724
It's wonderful to find a servant
these days who really shows
an interest, don'tyou think?.

Shuffle along. Here he comes.

- Everything satisfactory, Mr.Jennings?.
- yes, thankyou, Dorothy.

They have their drinks.
I thinkwe can all take
our leisure for half an hour or so.

- Oh.

And sincewhen did a baroness
outrank a countess?.

take the place ofhonor, please?

- Miss Trentham?

Ah, Miss Meredith.

would you come and sit
on my left?.

Naturally, I'm nothing when
there are visitors in the house.

- Nevermind. I'm used to it.
- Good evening, Mrs. wilson.

For what we are about to receive,

may the Lord make us
truly grateful.

488

[Jennings ] Right.
Start whenyou get it.

489
00:30:45,771 --> 00:30:47,705
No time for loitering.

490
00:30:50,776 --> 00:30:53,176
I 'm not serving tonight,
Mr. Jennings, am I ?.

491
00:30:53,245 --> 00:30:56,043
Not tonight, Elsie,
but probably tomorrow.

492
00:30:57,316 --> 00:30:59,409
where is Mrs. Croft?.

493
00:30:59,485 --> 00:31:01,419
Always eats
with her own staff.

494
00:31:01,487 --> 00:31:04,923
Does she take her pudding to
Mrs. wilson's room?. Our cook does that.

Fat chance.
They hate each other.

- Can I ask a question?.
- Certainly, Mr. weissman.

497

How can we helpyou?.

498
00:31:13,465 --> 00:31:17,731
I just wondered, how many people here
had parents in service?.

499
00:31:17,803 --> 00:31:20,829
And was that why
they chose to go into it?.

500
00:31:20,906 --> 00:31:25,741
what an interesting question,
and one to which, I'm afraid,
I cannot provide the answer.

501
00:31:25,811 --> 00:31:30,305
All ofyou whose parents
were in service, raiseyour hand.

- My fatherwas.
- Both-- nanny and groom.

- Notyou, Dorothy?
- My fatherwas a farmer, Mr.Jennings.

504
00:31:36,221 --> 00:31:38,815
A tenant of Lord Carton's.

505
00:31:38,891 --> 00:31:41,689
- Mr. Meredith?
- Factory hands, both of them.

506
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,092
- And ifyou ask me,
theywere better off.

what's the matter? Don'tyou know?

509
00:31:50,703 --> 00:31:52,830
yeah, I know
what they did.

510
00:31:52,905 --> 00:31:56,432
But it didn't have any effect
on me or my choice ofwork.

511
00:31:56,508 --> 00:31:59,409
- And why's that?.
- Because I grew up in an orphanage.

Thankyou, Mr. weissman,

for giving us all
a little something to think about.

and fi nish your supper.

I havejust found out...

518
00:32:36,315 --> 00:32:39,182
that Mr. weissman won't eat meat,
and I don't know what to do.

519
00:32:39,251 --> 00:32:41,378
I can't tell Mrs. Croft.
I si m ply don't dare.

00:32:41,453 --> 00:32:43,387
Everything's under control,
your Ladyship.

521
00:32:43,455 --> 00:32:45,423
Mr. weissman's valet informed us
as soon as he arrived,

522
00:32:45,491 --> 00:32:47,584
so we've prepared
a special version ofthe soup.

523
00:32:47,659 --> 00:32:49,650
He can eat the fish
and the hors d'oeuvres,

524
00:32:49,728 --> 00:32:51,662
and we'll have a welsh rarebit
for the game course.

525
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:55,427
I don't know what we're going
to do about the entree,
but we'll think of something.

is Mr. weissman's valet?.

wondering, william,

00:33:42,147 --> 00:33:44,775
ifI could have a word
with you alone after dinner.

that william and I...

with Lord stockbridge?.

892
00:58:07,611 --> 00:58:09,545
I'm sorry?.

893
00:58:10,814 --> 00:58:13,282
How areyou settling in
with Lord stockbridge?.

894
00:58:13,350 --> 00:58:16,786
I knowthatyou haven't
been with him forlong.

895
00:58:16,854 --> 00:58:19,288
Not long, no.

I'm afraid smoking
isn't allowed up here.

897
00:58:38,042 --> 00:58:41,808
I hope you're finding everything to make
His Lordship's stay more comfortable.

00:58:41,879 --> 00:58:44,211
I hope we haven't
forgotten anything.

I can't believeyou forget much,

No.

901
00:58:50,454 --> 00:58:52,854
Not much.

[ McCordle ]
you know-- Bang! whoof!.

905
00:59:16,246 --> 00:59:19,181
[ stockbridge ] you should be more
selective about the peopleyou invite.

906
00:59:19,249 --> 00:59:21,183
well, I've got
a good appetite.

907
00:59:21,251 --> 00:59:23,242

[ sylvia ]
Terribly muddy here. Do watch.

911
00:59:43,974 --> 00:59:46,909
Do you see what I'm saying?.
I've been noticing it.

Doesn't this look lovely?.
They really have done well.

913
00:59:50,481 --> 00:59:52,949
Now do go in
and have a drink.

914
00:59:53,017 --> 00:59:56,578
I can tell you, Raymond, it's
a bloody awful thing to have happened.

915
00:59:56,654 --> 00:59:59,589
- [McCordle ] Oh, God, Louisa.
- Oh! Oh, I say.

916
00:59:59,657 --> 01:00:02,592
Two inches to my right I'd have
been dead. I've just been shot.

01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:04,423
- what?.
- yes, that's right.

918

[ Constance ]
Oh,yes, please.

919
01:00:06,497 --> 01:00:09,762
- what happened to your ear?.
- some idiot shot me.

920
01:00:09,833 --> 01:00:12,768
- I was a terrible shot.
- Did you have fun?.

921
01:00:12,836 --> 01:00:16,272
- I don't thinkyou realize
howserious this is.
- [Lavinia ] Ofcourse I do.

922
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:18,774
why can't you get
your sisters to help?.

923
01:00:18,842 --> 01:00:22,073
Darling, do you think I haven't tried?.
you know what they're like.

924
01:00:22,146 --> 01:00:25,081
well, I know they couldn't care less
ifwe go under.

925
01:00:25,149 --> 01:00:29,347
why should they care,
as long as their dressmakers are busy
and their dinners are on time?.

926
01:00:32,423 --> 01:00:35,358
- wait a minute. There's a queue here.
- shh. shh.

for heaven's sake.

Don't worry.
It's only Lewis and Dorothy.

930
01:00:43,934 --> 01:00:47,370
If any ofthe men get found up here,
they get sacked on the spot.

931
01:00:47,438 --> 01:00:49,372
worse luck.

932
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:52,603
so don't tell me,
you're a convent girl.

933
01:00:52,676 --> 01:00:55,110
Or is that
Presbyterian modesty?.

934
01:00:57,514 --> 01:00:59,948
- Is the water hot?.
- Not really.

935
01:01:01,518 --> 01:01:04,783
No, it won't be
till the guns get back.

936
01:01:04,855 --> 01:01:07,790
I'd better
get in yours.

937
01:01:07,858 --> 01:01:10,793
Her Ladyship says that sirwilliam
loves his shooting.

938
01:01:10,861 --> 01:01:14,297
yeah, he does. Can't hit a barn door,
but he does love it.

939
01:01:14,364 --> 01:01:16,298
It's quite sweet,

- yeah?.

Last night--

942
01:01:23,407 --> 01:01:25,341
what?.

943
01:01:25,409 --> 01:01:27,343
No, I shouldn't say.

944

yes, you should.
what?.

945
01:01:31,348 --> 01:01:33,282
well,

946
01:01:33,350 --> 01:01:35,784
when I went down
to wash that shirt,

947
01:01:35,853 --> 01:01:38,788
I think I saw him
in the ironing room.

948
01:01:38,856 --> 01:01:41,290
[ whispers ] He was with
one ofthe kitchen maids.

949
01:01:41,358 --> 01:01:43,553
- No, that wouldn't have been him.
- I think itwas.

950
01:01:43,627 --> 01:01:46,061
He came down the passage
a minute later,

951
01:01:46,130 --> 01:01:48,064
and I don't see how--

952
01:01:48,132 --> 01:01:50,066
No, it wasn't him.

953
01:01:50,134 --> 01:01:52,068
you weren't serious
last night, wereyou?.

954
01:01:52,136 --> 01:01:54,070
I'm afraid I was,
old boy.

955
01:01:54,138 --> 01:01:57,073
I was going to tell you next week,
but sinceyou mentioned it--

956
01:01:57,141 --> 01:02:00,076
I don't thinkyou've grasped quite
what it'll do to the whole project,

957
01:02:00,144 --> 01:02:02,578
and in particular
what it'll do to me.

958
01:02:02,646 --> 01:02:05,581
- It can't be as black
as all that, can it?.
- yes, it bloodywell is.

but business is business.

it's very simple

when I detect 'em
I soon collect 'em

simply waiting to be picked

could've had his pick...

- Aye.
- well, I asked Her Ladyship about it.

she said
they cut cards for him.

- No!
- I know.

981
01:03:04,374 --> 01:03:06,308
I can't believe it
either.

982
01:03:06,376 --> 01:03:08,810
Do you suppose
it was a joke?.

983
01:03:08,879 --> 01:03:11,814
well, I wouldn't
be too sure.

984
01:03:11,882 --> 01:03:14,146
you know what I heard?.

01:03:14,218 --> 01:03:16,152
Oh,just listen to me.

- what?
- why do we spend our lives
living through them?.

I mean,
look at poor old Lewis.

Ifher own mother
had a heart attack,

989
01:03:25,529 --> 01:03:28,464
she'd think it was less important
than one of Lady sylvia's farts.

990
01:03:28,532 --> 01:03:31,592
you must know.
you can't fool me.

991
01:03:31,668 --> 01:03:34,501
Ifthere's one thing I don't
look for in a maid, it's discretion.

Except with my own secrets,
of course.

well, I don't knowmuch,
milady,

994
01:03:39,443 --> 01:03:42,708
but apparently he was counting
on sirwilliam for an investment...

995
01:03:42,779 --> 01:03:46,271
and had guaranteed his interest,
whatever that means.

996
01:03:46,350 --> 01:03:48,716
Anyway, Mr. Barnes,
the commander's valet,

997
01:03:48,785 --> 01:03:51,219
he said he wanted
to leave at once,

998
01:03:51,288 --> 01:03:55,224
but Lady Lavinia's persuaded him
to stay until tomorrow
to make less of a thing of it.

you were wearing white.

1001
01:03:59,630 --> 01:04:02,565
white?. she must be mad.
I never wear white.

1002
01:04:02,633 --> 01:04:04,567
I thought
it was a little odd.

1003
01:04:04,635 --> 01:04:07,968
By the way, for God's sake,
don't rub him up tonight.

1004
01:04:08,038 --> 01:04:10,973
- I don't know what you mean.
- you know exactlywhat I mean.

1005
01:04:11,041 --> 01:04:13,475
He's in a filthy mood
with everyone.

1006
01:04:13,543 --> 01:04:15,636
He's talking about
stopping your allowance.

1007
01:04:17,047 --> 01:04:20,483
But it's for life.
That was settled. He can't do that.

1008
01:04:20,550 --> 01:04:24,316
Justyou watch him.
He's absolutely spoiling for a fight.

1009
01:04:24,388 --> 01:04:27,323
so ifyou'll take my advice,
you won't give him one.

Goodness, isn't it prettyhere?

1014

The house has
such lovely position.

1015
01:04:46,343 --> 01:04:48,937
The best view's
from the old water tower.

1016

you might well
walk up there tomorrow.

1017

Do you really have to
go back to London?.

1018

I am afraid so,

1019

when you're ruined,
there's so much to do.

01:05:02,359 --> 01:05:04,293
yes, there is,
isn't there?.

1021
01:05:04,361 --> 01:05:06,295

would anybody care for
a game ofbridge after dinner?.

Oh,yes, I wouldn't mind.

Louisa, how about you?.

1026
01:05:23,613 --> 01:05:28,243
Oh, I don't think so.
I've rather gone off cards.

1027
01:05:28,318 --> 01:05:30,548
I've never been very lucky
with them.

1028
01:05:31,621 --> 01:05:33,384
Me too.

1029
01:05:37,461 --> 01:05:41,090
Mr. weissman, tell us about
the film you're going to make.

1030
01:05:41,164 --> 01:05:44,600
Oh, sure. It's called Charlie Chan
in London. It's a detective story.

1031
01:05:44,668 --> 01:05:48,160
- set in London?.
- well, not really.

1032
01:05:48,238 --> 01:05:51,503
Most of it takes place at
a shooting party in a country house,

1033
01:05:51,575 --> 01:05:54,009
sort of like this one,
actually.

And who turns out
to have done it?

1038
01:06:05,756 --> 01:06:08,987
I couldn't tell you that.
It would spoil it foryou.

01:06:09,059 --> 01:06:11,994
- Oh, but none of us will see it.
- [ Gasps, Chuckles ]

1040
01:06:13,330 --> 01:06:15,662
Are you thinking of
making it here, Mr. weissman?.

1041
01:06:15,732 --> 01:06:19,998
Uh, no, we're going to shoot it
in Hollywood, on the back lot.

1042
01:06:20,070 --> 01:06:24,598
Butsince I was in England,
I thought I would do
a little research on country living...

1043
01:06:24,674 --> 01:06:29,611
and Ivor was kind enough
to arrange it for me.

1044
01:06:29,679 --> 01:06:32,307
Mm m, no.
wil I iam arranged it for you.

1045
01:06:32,382 --> 01:06:36,113
- [ weissman ]
Are you interested in films, sir?
- [ scoffs ] Not likely.

1046
01:06:36,186 --> 01:06:39,019
why shouldn't I
be interested in films?.

1047
01:06:39,089 --> 01:06:40,989
you don't know
what I'm interested in.

1048
01:06:41,058 --> 01:06:44,391
well, I know you're interested in money
and fiddling with your guns,

1049
01:06:44,461 --> 01:06:46,395
but when it comes to anything else,
I'm stumped.

1050
01:06:46,463 --> 01:06:48,397
That is not fair.
Bill is--

1051
01:06:50,534 --> 01:06:52,468
[ Laughs ]

1052
01:07:38,248 --> 01:07:40,182
Elsie.

1053
01:07:41,751 --> 01:07:43,685
Elsie, what's--

1054
01:07:46,923 --> 01:07:49,357
It's not as if
I didn't know.

1055
01:07:49,426 --> 01:07:52,623
- [ Chuckling ]
- so we can all play bridge.

1056
01:07:52,696 --> 01:07:57,633
- All playing?.
- who's going to play bridge?.
Are they going to play?.

1057
01:07:57,701 --> 01:07:59,794
where's Rupert?.

1058
01:07:59,870 --> 01:08:02,031
- Rupert!
- [Standish ] Coming.

1059
01:08:02,105 --> 01:08:04,039
[whispering]

1060
01:08:04,107 --> 01:08:08,407
- I heard Lady Sylvia spoke out ofturn.
- you didn't actually see?.
