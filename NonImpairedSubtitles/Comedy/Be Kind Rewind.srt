1
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:34,631
<i>Everyone thinks Harlem</i>
<i>was the capital of jazz in the 1930s.</i>

2
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:40,334
<i>That all of New York flooded uptown</i>
<i>at night to party till dawn.</i>

3
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:44,443
<i>Nice story, but unfortunately,</i>
<i>it's just not true.</i>

4
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:48,741
<i>It was all happening in the little town</i>
<i>of Passaic, New Jersey.</i>

5
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:52,448
<i>Passaic was the capital of jazz</i>
<i>in the '20s and '30s...</i>

6
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:55,053
<i>... because of its own native son...</i>

7
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,916
<i>... Thomas "Fats" Waller...</i>

8
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,752
<i>... one of the greatest entertainers</i>
<i>of all time.</i>

9
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:02,394
<i>Chapter 1, the birth of Fats Waller.</i>

10
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:06,862
<i>It all began right here,</i>
<i>a hundred years ago...</i>

11
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:09,501
<i>... in Passaic, New Jersey.</i>

12
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:11,432
<i>Right here, on this block.</i>

13
00:01:11,604 --> 00:01:13,731
<i>It was a different neighborhood then,</i>
<i>but look here...</i>

14
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,568
<i>... he was born at 261 Main Street.</i>

15
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,575
<i>When he was young, he used to follow</i>
<i>his father around the streets...</i>

16
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,009
<i>... because his father</i>
<i>was a street minister.</i>

17
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:24,947
<i>He started playing piano, as I understand,</i>
<i>out in the streets here in Passaic...</i>

18
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:26,142
<i>... on a harmonium.</i>

19
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:29,777
<i>Poor boy put on pounds</i>
<i>faster than the price of aluminum.</i>

20
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:33,119
<i>One-forty-seven.</i>

21
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:35,784
<i>Thomas, you're gonna break</i>
<i>Dr. Benton 's scale.</i>

22
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:37,452
<i>You're getting worse.</i>

23
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:41,157
<i>Maybe that's why he would have to play</i>
<i>a very huge instrument.</i>

24
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:43,996
<i>So he would spend nights here,</i>
<i>at the great organ.</i>

25
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,764
<i>Fats used the church</i>
<i>as his training ground.</i>

26
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,842
<i>And soon, all of Passaic</i>
<i>would know his name.</i>

27
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,376
<i>Fats lived his life all in excess.</i>

28
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:58,142
<i>Loads of music, loads of food</i>
<i>and loads of women.</i>

29
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:03,051
<i>Who would expect a simple influenza virus</i>
<i>would get him in his bed?</i>

30
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:04,952
<i>A sleeping-train bed, though.</i>

31
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:09,926
<i>But still, the train had been stopped</i>
<i>in the freezing cold winter...</i>

32
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:12,690
<i>... in the train station in Kansas City.</i>

33
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:16,029
<i>Fats, are you okay? Fats? You okay?</i>

34
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:20,229
<i>Is there a doctor on the train?</i>

35
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:28,946
<i>Fats was the star</i>
<i>that made the whole town shine.</i>

36
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:41,693
Hey, Jerry, hand me Number 9.

37
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:46,694
<i>I will give you</i>

38
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:49,926
- Okay. All right.
<i>- Number 9</i>

39
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:51,993
<i>Handing you number</i>

40
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,106
- Would you shut up?
<i>- Number 9</i>

41
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:57,503
Could you just paint
and be quiet, please?

42
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,167
Knock it off.

43
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,505
It's terrible.

44
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,886
- What the duck, Jerry?
- What?

45
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:15,357
I asked you to give me Number 9,
the nose.

46
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:16,722
Yeah, that's what I did.

47
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:19,831
No, you didn't. This is Number 6.
This is the eye.

48
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:23,264
All right, well, how am I supposed to tell
the difference between a six and a nine?

49
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:25,961
Because we did both the eyes already,
you doofus.

50
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,163
Come on, get organized.

51
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,604
I told you, put the finished ones
in a separate pile.

52
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:31,243
Look, what's the difference, man?

53
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:34,403
A nostril and an upside-down eye
are the same anyway. It looks fine.

54
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:38,483
Oh, is that supposed to be funny?
Are you trying to say Fats had big nostrils?

55
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:41,176
- Jerry.
- Hi, officer, how's it going?

56
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:44,517
Look what happened. Last night,
some hoodlums came and did...

57
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:46,625
- Oh, really?
...all this stuff here, this...

58
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:49,284
- Here we go again.
- It's disgusting.

59
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:52,397
- I hate graffiti.
- Yeah, they even left the ladder.

60
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,931
That's, like, evidence.
We should confiscate it.

61
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:57,467
- Catch them.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.

62
00:03:57,637 --> 00:03:59,468
You're getting on my nerves.

63
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:02,836
You keep this up,
you'll be spending the night in jail.

64
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:05,000
- Okay.
- Moron.

65
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:07,373
If... If they come back for the ladder,
we'll catch them.

66
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:11,449
Hey, fellas, is that supposed to be
Biggie Smalls or something?

67
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:14,644
No, man, that's that dead old blues guy,
Louis Armstrong.

68
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:18,154
No, my ignorant little buddies,
this is Fats Waller.

69
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:20,224
- Really?
- Famous ja<i>zz</i> musician.

70
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:23,851
He was born in my building
about a hundred years ago.

71
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:30,328
<i>- Ice cream, anyone?</i>
<i>- Oh, yeah.</i>

72
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:32,835
That's what I'm talking about.

73
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:36,506
Mr. Fletcher, you know,
really, seriously...

74
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:39,201
...if you don't like the painting,
you can... You can tell me.

75
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:43,281
I know that there's something wrong
with the nose, I don't know if you noticed.

76
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,979
What about the authorities, Mike?

77
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:48,882
The city already has issues
with the building as it is.

78
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:51,489
Mr. Fletcher, you don't have
to worry about the police.

79
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:54,627
- I worked my magic on them.
- Yeah, he did confuse them.

80
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,785
Okay, they think some gangsters did it.

81
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,988
- And you confused them?
- Yeah, with my finesse.

82
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:02,191
Yeah, I feel great. You sure
this is gonna bring us more customers?

83
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:05,565
I hope so. I mean, anyway, don't you think
it's time the people around here...

84
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:09,139
...started to learn a bit little about, you
know, the history of their neighborhood?

85
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,709
I mean, people don't even know
who Fats is.

86
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:14,574
- It's a little embarrassing.
- Hey. Hey. That's not true.

87
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,546
- We know who Fats Waller is.
- Is that right?

88
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:19,981
Bet you can't sing a ja<i>zz</i> song.

89
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:23,054
- Oh, challenge.
- Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

90
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:25,950
That's not ja<i>zz.</i>

91
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,183
<i>Fuzzy, oh, oh</i>

92
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,319
<i>Fuzzy wuzzy was a bear</i>
<i>Fuzzy jazzy had no hair</i>

93
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,829
<i>Fuzzy wuzzy wasn 't fuzzy, was he?</i>

94
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,595
<i>Yes, he was, he was Fuzzy</i>
<i>Had a fuzzy face</i>

95
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:42,070
<i>Check this out and let me say</i>
<i>One thing to you</i>

96
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:44,709
<i>Watch me play my fuzzy bass</i>

97
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:50,039
Standup bass.

98
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:54,751
I'm sorry, Mr. Fletcher.

99
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:56,445
It's all right, Jerry. I got it.

100
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:58,214
Actually, you gotta go back to work.

101
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:00,723
Duty calls. You gotta
go back to the microwave.

102
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:02,793
I think I saw one of your creations
just roll by.

103
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:05,055
- Turn the microwave on high.
- You think it's a joke?

104
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:07,756
Let me tell you, you're gonna
be responsible for my brain tumor.

105
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:10,129
- All of you guys are.
- Where the hell is Jerry?

106
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:11,531
Man, what's her problem?

107
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:14,036
She said she wanted a sporty car,
now she's freaking out.

108
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,299
You did that?

109
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:21,806
- I don't want this.
- Don't forget your salad bowl.

110
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:24,176
I told you she wouldn't be
into them big pipes.

111
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,079
Polish or not, she's still a girl.

112
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:28,618
Come on, Wilson.
She couldn't get the doors open.

113
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:31,222
Well, she could have went through
the window.

114
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,086
These damn helmets.

115
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,888
I don't think they're helping
with the microwaves at all.

116
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,394
Oh, you'll thank me.

117
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:41,499
- All right, I'll see you in the morning.
- All right, thanks.

118
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:59,917
Good night, Mike.
Don't forget to turn out the lights.

119
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,951
Good night, Mr. Fletcher.

120
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,499
<i>A rent party was the place to be</i>
<i>in the '20s and '30s.</i>

121
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:20,696
They were jumping.

122
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:22,932
If you didn't have enough money
to cover your rent...

123
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:27,307
...you'd invite a few musicians,
charge for drinks, and you'd get it on.

124
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,948
Everybody would throw
just a little bit in the pot.

125
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,981
<i>A dollar, whatever they could spare.</i>

126
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:34,585
Jerry doesn't believe you've ever been
to a rent party, Mr. Fletcher.

127
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:36,779
What are you talking about?
I never said that.

128
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,287
Oh, man, I used to go to all of them.

129
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,619
That's where I'd meet
all the girls on Saturday night.

130
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,353
I can't imagine you with a girl,
Mr. Fletcher.

131
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:46,657
Oh, nice, that's great. That's perfect.

132
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,266
Yeah, what about you, Jerry?

133
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:51,961
I don't see much action
coming out of your trailer at night.

134
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:55,369
When I was your age,
my balls were flapping so hard...

135
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:58,305
... I had to scrape them off the ground
and beg them to come home with me.

136
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,878
- Come on, balls.
- Yeah, come on.

137
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:03,106
Come on. That's hilarious.

138
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:04,306
What about you, Mike?

139
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,418
When was the last time you heard
some action coming out of his room?

140
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:08,076
Why are you all worried about me for?

141
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:09,949
I heard some action sometime.

142
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:13,523
Now, it's more like a trumpet solo.

143
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:16,653
Trumpet solo.

144
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,763
Could you close your mouth
when you chew? Thanks.

145
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:20,660
How come you never got married,
Mr. Fletcher?

146
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:24,496
Well, the common story is...

147
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,901
...the girl that you was gonna ask,
you waited too long to ask...

148
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:30,406
...and she went on
and married somebody else.

149
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:33,670
And then you can't find anybody
that compared to her.

150
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,747
So, what happens? You get old.

151
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:48,817
Obviously we're looking
at a real improvement in quality of life.

152
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:50,963
These brand-new condominiums
are gonna bring us...

153
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,155
...the fresh blood
that we need for our community...

154
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:56,199
...and transform this slum forever.

155
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,702
"Slum"? Hey, this is not a slum.

156
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:03,899
Hey, sure, the place needs a few repairs,
but I'm taking care of it.

157
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:06,203
Look, look,
business is about to pick up.

158
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,607
I can feel it.

159
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,943
I'm sorry, Mr. Fletcher,
but the building is condemned.

160
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:14,883
It violates structural,
fire and plumbing standards.

161
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,818
I don't see wheelchair access.

162
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,753
Your video store is a tenement.

163
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:23,554
You have 60 days from this notice
of demolition...

164
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,698
...to bring it up to code,
otherwise we will have to demolish it.

165
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,857
- But we will relocate you...
- Yes.

166
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:31,936
...to a property
of proportionate fair-market value.

167
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:33,662
Projects aren't so bad, you know.

168
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,739
Move to the projects?

169
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:39,667
How am I gonna tell Mike?

170
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:43,941
Look, I just wanna improve the life
of the people of Passaic, that's all.

171
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:50,547
You know, you don't have to pay me
this month, Mr. Fletcher. I'm okay.

172
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:54,159
Don't worry about the money, Mike.
I'll pay you soon.

173
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:59,060
I n fact, l... I need for you
to take over for me.

174
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:01,290
- You're retiring?
- Oh, no, no, no.

175
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:04,231
This year's the 60th anniversary
of Fats' death.

176
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:07,861
And there's a ceremony
that's being organized in commemoration.

177
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,907
We gonna all get together
in that abandoned train where he died...

178
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:13,170
...and we're gonna play his records
until morning.

179
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:15,143
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

180
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:17,111
I wanna come. Can I come with you?

181
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,375
No.

182
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:20,485
I just told you,
I need you to take over for me.

183
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:24,612
Oh, right, right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Okay.

184
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,020
You want me to just run the shop
while you're gone?

185
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:28,558
You think I could do that?

186
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:30,457
You tell me.

187
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,622
I'm not gonna let you down,
Mr. Fletcher.

188
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,827
Good, just don't set the place on fire.

189
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:38,994
Oh, no. Service, quality, safety,
you can count on that.

190
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:41,036
Excellent.

191
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:43,334
Here's something really important:

192
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:44,601
You must never...

193
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,745
Slam the door, because
the building will collapse.

194
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:50,905
No, Mike. I mean, yes,
but that's not what I wanted to say.

195
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,779
- You must never...
- Use the VCR to rewind the tapes...

196
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:56,319
No. Why do you always
have to finish my sentences?

197
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,650
- Okay, just listen.
- Okay. I'm sorry. Go ahead.

198
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,657
Okay, you must... Damn it.

199
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:04,695
Now I forgot what I had to say.

200
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:07,264
- But it's very...
- Lock the door.

201
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:09,962
- Mr. Fletcher, have a good trip.
- I'll have a good trip.

202
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:11,535
Take some pictures and call me.

203
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:13,228
Oh, yes, yes. l... I remember.

204
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:15,696
See, you wanted to finish my sentence.

205
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:19,333
- I lost my focus. I can't...
- No, no. I was listening. I was listening.

206
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,606
Hey, Mike. Mike. Keep Jerry...

207
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:25,046
I can't hear you.

208
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:28,610
Keep Jerry out. Out, out.

209
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:32,418
What? I don't know what that means.

210
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:35,185
"Peek your edge too.
Peek your edge<i>..."</i>

211
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:40,365
"Tuo. Too. Peek your edge too<i>."</i>

212
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,364
That's what it is.

213
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:45,737
I just found out something sad today.

214
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,231
Mr. Fletcher can't spell.

215
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:53,643
Maybe his parents
couldn't afford school.

216
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:55,508
Did he have parents?

217
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,643
- Yeah.
- I nteresting.

218
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:01,150
Don't mention this to anybody.

219
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,721
- Just keep this between us. Don't...
- Of course not, that would be racist.

220
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:08,155
Peek your... Pick.

221
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:09,817
Your age. Pick your age.

222
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,019
He's talking gibberish.

223
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:14,826
It's nonsense, but it's not his fault.

224
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:19,031
The power plant's controlling us.
I know it.

225
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,139
- Through microwaves.
- Mm-hm.

226
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:24,071
They're using it to make us do things.

227
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,438
To buy things, to accept things.

228
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:28,978
And who...? Who...? Who are they?
Who are "they"?

229
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:31,981
The government, the FBI, of course.

230
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:34,745
- And I say no more.
- Right.

231
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,047
I'm gonna sabotage
the power plant tonight...

232
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:38,588
...and you're gonna help me.

233
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,318
Look, I got a map.
Completely worked out.

234
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:43,621
We short-circuit this
with whatever that thing is.

235
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:45,661
And that blows up the transformer.

236
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:47,492
All we gotta do is climb the fence...

237
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:51,500
...and throw this sweet grappling hook
right into the transformer. Boom.

238
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:53,266
You know what I mean?

239
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,031
Yeah.

240
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:57,607
This, my friend, is your camouflage.

241
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,074
Camouflage.

242
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:00,269
Bones.

243
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,811
We need that electricity.

244
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:05,144
You know, we got the machines, we...
And nobody rewinds the tapes.

245
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:07,251
- This is more important than that.
- You gotta rewind the tapes.

246
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:09,011
That's the lamest excuse
I've ever heard.

247
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:11,952
It's totally non-sequitury,
what you're saying to me.

248
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,955
- It's a lame excuse?
- Yeah, it's lame.

249
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,321
Really? And the power plant
is controlling us?

250
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:18,122
That's not nonsense?
That's not paranoia?

251
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,390
Okay, it sounds crazy,
and you know why?

252
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:22,966
- Because it's affecting my brain too.
- Mm-hm.

253
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,159
It's paranizing it.

254
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:27,271
Mr. Fletcher left me
in charge of the store.

255
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:30,237
Me. He trusted me with the store.
Do you know what that means?

256
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:33,378
No, actually I don't.
Maybe you could explain it to me.

257
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,138
- It means that I'm not doing this.
- What?

258
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,611
- I'm not doing this with you.
- Okay.

259
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:38,443
So you'll just do anything
Mr. Fletcher says...

260
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:40,551
...even though, by the way,
he's not your real father.

261
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:42,550
- So... So what?
- And he's completely illiterate.

262
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:44,018
- He's not...
- But you won't do anything for me...

263
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,919
...your best friend,
who has a melting brain.

264
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:49,527
Can I...? Can I...? Can I help you
make a selection? Because if not...

265
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,823
... I'm gonna have to ask you
to make space for the other customers.

266
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,425
Oh, sorry, I didn't realize
it was rush hour.

267
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:57,000
I won't bother you anymore.

268
00:13:57,169 --> 00:14:00,195
You know, it does get busy unexpectedly.

269
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:01,805
And you know, he's not illiterate.

270
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:04,772
First of all, because if he was illiterate,
smart guy...

271
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:06,468
... he wouldn't be able to write:

272
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:08,476
"Peek your edge too<i>."</i>

273
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:11,810
Which is... It's probably Buddhist
or something.

274
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:13,781
It's like... Like a chant.

275
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:16,387
"Peek your... Pick your edge too<i>."</i>

276
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,823
<i>- Smart guy.</i>
- I'm not saying he's illiterate.

277
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:22,154
I mean, he could just use some
night-schooling to perfect his spelling.

278
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:23,818
Just go.

279
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:25,894
Slow. Slower.

280
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:34,769
You all right?

281
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,373
Come on over. It's easy.

282
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,811
Freeze.

283
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:50,581
They always come at night
and bother me.

284
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:55,056
- Oh, come on, it's my turn tonight.
- No way. This is my baby.

285
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,457
Department of Homeland Security.

286
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,029
Wake up.

287
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:00,597
Be invisible.

288
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:01,926
Shh, did you hear something?

289
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:03,693
Yeah.

290
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:08,971
There's that ladder again.

291
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:12,642
What do you think?

292
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:15,644
I don't know, some kind of ladder gang
or something?

293
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:17,543
Oh, the ladder gang.

294
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:20,082
Let's go get some ice cream.

295
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,830
<i>- "</i>Peek your edge too<i>."</i>
- What's so funny?

296
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:34,226
"Keep Jerry out<i>."</i>

297
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,131
- Who cares about that right now?
- He's not illiterate<i>. "</i>Keep Jerry out<i>."</i>

298
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,636
- He's not illiterate.
- Who cares? Get over...

299
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:42,797
- What are you doing?
- I can't be here for this.

300
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:44,772
What are you doing? Mike, no. Mike.

301
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,344
- Mike, put that ladder back.
- I can't let you in the store.

302
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:49,981
- Mike, you're coming over the thing.
- Mr. Fletcher trusted me.

303
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:52,640
Mr. Fletcher's not gonna yell at you,
he's way too laid back.

304
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:55,218
I know he's not gonna yell at me.
That's part of the problem.

305
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:57,582
He's very good to me. I can't
let him down. I can't disappoint him.

306
00:15:57,756 --> 00:15:58,780
Listen, you don't need me.

307
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,789
- You're almost there.
- I'll never speak to you.

308
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,393
I will never speak to you again.

309
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:04,961
Mike! Mike!

310
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:08,027
Traitor.

311
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:09,358
I'll do it alone, baby.

312
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:11,994
Solo mission.

313
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,002
Solo sabotage.

314
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:25,082
Mike! Come back!

315
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:44,632
No, Jerry, no.

316
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:47,397
No. No. You have to go.

317
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:50,935
You see the signs? "Keep Jerry out<i>."</i>

318
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,509
This is in, that's out.

319
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:57,172
Go home, take a shower, lie down.

320
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:14,264
Oh, come on.

321
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:18,998
Get out of the street.
Get out of the street.

322
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:22,072
Wipe your face.
Jesus. Stand right there.

323
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:24,300
I'll get you some water.

324
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:27,234
Don't move, just wait a minute.

325
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:39,716
Oh, you feeling better now?

326
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:44,886
Mike, aren't you gonna ask me
how the sabotage went?

327
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,190
No, I wasn't, actually.

328
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:49,334
Oh, come on,
ask me how the sabotage went.

329
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:51,435
Okay, how'd the sabotage go?

330
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:54,128
Terrible. It was a two-man operation.

331
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:57,734
- It was a two-person sabotage.
- Shh.

332
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,845
Ma'am, if you need any help,
just let me know.

333
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:03,743
How about if I need any help?
Should I let you know?

334
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,009
- I wasn't talking to you.
- Yeah, apparently not.

335
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:07,743
Thanks.

336
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,190
Oh, that's not in alphabetical order.

337
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:18,329
I know that, it's the new order.
Excuse me.

338
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:20,260
- Do you work here? I don't think so.
- Jerry.

339
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,764
Haven't you heard
about the new West Coast Video...

340
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,563
...more efficient,
non-alphabetical order...

341
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:27,432
... Miss l-Know-Where-to-Put-the-Videos?

342
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:32,977
No, it's time for me
to educate your customers.

343
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:35,409
Do you put everything in your house
in alphabetical order?

344
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:38,049
- Like all of your food in the refrigerator?
- You know, maybe...

345
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:40,981
- Apples, bananas, carrots.
- She might, and that would be fine...

346
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:43,485
- Ding-Dongs.
...because she didn't do anything wrong.

347
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:46,215
You know what I just realized?
I bet she's super-organized.

348
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:49,258
She's really like:
I hate those kind of people.

349
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:51,328
- You are incredibly rude.
- Don't attack me, lady.

350
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:53,988
- You're incredibly rude, mister.
- Are you done yelling in my ear?

351
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,190
- I'm sorry, ma'am.
- I'm sorry.

352
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:57,062
Did I put your forks
into the spoon drawer?

353
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:59,227
- Go home.
- Don't put the TV next to the radio.

354
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:00,894
- Why don't you just go, go, go?
- Get some rest.

355
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:02,700
- Lunatic!
- You're the cuckoo. Hey. Hey.

356
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,901
Don't put the shoes in the refrigerator,
because they'll get cold.

357
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,810
- Wow...
- Dumb broad.

358
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,040
- I am really, really sorry.
- Yeah.

359
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:12,376
He's a veteran, actually.

360
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:15,418
He's had a lot of exposure to,
you know, chemicals and stuff.

361
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:19,580
If there's anything you need, we got...
We got books, we got albums.

362
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:21,953
I got some refreshments
in the icebox.

363
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:23,219
Okay, I appreciate it.

364
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:24,919
You're welcome.

365
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:37,465
Fletcher...

366
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:44,572
...you'll pull through. Every time you think
it's the end, you always pull through.

367
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,945
Look here, look here, Mo.
I wish it was that easy, man.

368
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,518
But not this time.

369
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:51,417
I can't adapt, and that's why I'm broke.

370
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,423
Fletcher, this is America.

371
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:57,153
Anybody can make money.

372
00:19:57,329 --> 00:20:00,492
But you...
No, let me show you something.

373
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:03,362
We made a ton of money
with this little thing.

374
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:06,129
- What, this is a dish-squirting brush?
- Mm-hm.

375
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:09,138
- And the soap goes in here?
- Yep. Yep.

376
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:11,469
- A great idea.
- You know, the squirting idea...

377
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:12,974
... has been around for years.

378
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:16,444
But we didn't make squat
until we added this.

379
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:18,776
A stainless-steel cover on the handle.

380
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:20,748
People going crazy over it.

381
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:24,411
- Man, our sales increased 800 percent.
- What?

382
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:29,425
And we expanded our market share
tenfold in two years.

383
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:33,053
You need to go visit all
of the successful renting businesses...

384
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,099
...and learn and adapt.
You said you can't adapt.

385
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:39,169
Adapt. Then just give the people
what they want.

386
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:42,796
- That's all you gotta do.
- Give the people what they want.

387
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:05,487
<i>Hello?</i>

388
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:06,892
Hello, Miss Falewicz? It's...

389
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:09,659
l... I know who this is, Mr. Fletcher.

390
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:12,565
l... I was hoping to hear from you.

391
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:16,071
I was calling regarding the tape
of <i>Driving Miss Daisy.</i>

392
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:17,731
Mike told me you still have it.

393
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:19,501
<i>Oh, do I?</i>

394
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:22,306
Well, I'll find it and...
And bring it by tomorrow.

395
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:24,506
Oh, no hurry.
I'm... I'm out of town anyway.

396
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:27,447
I'm doing a little work
and doing a little research.

397
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,917
<i>Oh? Well, how long will you be gone?</i>

398
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:32,249
- A week at the most.
<i>- Really.</i>

399
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:34,255
- Can I ask a favor?
- Yes.

400
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:37,293
Would you keep an eye out on Jerry
for me while I'm gone?

401
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,157
He destroys everything he touches.

402
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,932
Hi, good morning.

403
00:21:51,108 --> 00:21:53,201
- It's blank.
- I'm sorry?

404
00:21:53,377 --> 00:21:56,141
Rewound this tape all over,
and it's blank.

405
00:21:56,314 --> 00:21:57,941
Really? Did you check the...?

406
00:21:58,115 --> 00:21:59,844
Sure did. Checked that.

407
00:22:00,017 --> 00:22:02,281
You know, sometimes
you gotta use head cleaner...

408
00:22:02,453 --> 00:22:03,545
Okay. I did that, actually.

409
00:22:03,721 --> 00:22:05,120
It'll eat the tapes.

410
00:22:05,289 --> 00:22:07,052
I'll just pop it in, see what's going on.

411
00:22:07,224 --> 00:22:08,714
Excuse me, this video don't work.

412
00:22:08,893 --> 00:22:10,224
- Sorry?
- It don't work.

413
00:22:10,394 --> 00:22:12,021
It does... It won't play?

414
00:22:12,196 --> 00:22:14,824
No, I rewound it,
I played it and everything.

415
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:16,728
It's nothing but fu<i>zz.</i> Yeah, like that.

416
00:22:17,335 --> 00:22:20,031
Huh. Is your VCR NTSC?

417
00:22:20,204 --> 00:22:21,262
No, it's brand-new.

418
00:22:21,439 --> 00:22:23,339
Do you always blame
everything on the customer?

419
00:22:23,507 --> 00:22:25,304
- No, not at all.
- Where is...?

420
00:22:25,476 --> 00:22:26,738
Where's...? Where's Mr. Fletcher?

421
00:22:26,911 --> 00:22:30,403
He's away on a...
On a memorial trip...

422
00:22:30,581 --> 00:22:34,540
...so he left me in charge
as manager of the store.

423
00:22:34,719 --> 00:22:36,118
So you know what I'm gonna do?

424
00:22:36,287 --> 00:22:40,883
Both of you, free of charge, can have
any two tapes that you'd like in the shop.

425
00:22:41,058 --> 00:22:45,222
No, thanks. What I would like
is to be reimbursed my dollar.

426
00:22:45,396 --> 00:22:46,886
- Okay.
- Because I've had enough.

427
00:22:47,064 --> 00:22:49,624
Okay. Is there anything
that I could do to make...?

428
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,495
No, just my dollar.

429
00:22:51,669 --> 00:22:53,330
I'll just... I was just...

430
00:22:54,138 --> 00:22:56,299
- I'm really sorry about all this.
- Unfortunate.

431
00:22:56,474 --> 00:22:58,032
Yeah, the whole thing is unfortunate.

432
00:22:58,209 --> 00:23:00,336
This button... I'm really... Okay.

433
00:23:00,511 --> 00:23:01,773
That one right there.

434
00:23:01,946 --> 00:23:03,846
I tried... Oh, that's not it either.

435
00:23:04,014 --> 00:23:05,538
You know what?
I think I have a dollar.

436
00:23:05,716 --> 00:23:07,581
- Okay, there it is.
- Good. Okay, great.

437
00:23:07,752 --> 00:23:09,219
I'm really very sorry about that.

438
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:10,411
Thank you.

439
00:23:10,588 --> 00:23:12,453
You don't have to mention this
to Mr. Fletcher.

440
00:23:12,623 --> 00:23:14,215
- Give me my dollar.
- You can have it.

441
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:16,451
Okay, not... Not a problem.
I'm sorry about that.

442
00:23:16,627 --> 00:23:18,720
- Uh-huh.
- All right, I got these two.

443
00:23:18,896 --> 00:23:21,296
Okay, that's... Okay, not a problem.

444
00:23:30,808 --> 00:23:32,435
Stop.

445
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:41,816
No! No!

446
00:23:42,253 --> 00:23:44,380
All the tapes are blank.

447
00:23:44,555 --> 00:23:48,855
The movies, all of them, they're all...

448
00:23:49,026 --> 00:23:51,756
They're all gone,
all the tapes are gone.

449
00:23:51,929 --> 00:23:53,294
Where?

450
00:23:56,367 --> 00:23:58,426
Mr. Fletcher's gonna flip
when he sees this.

451
00:23:58,602 --> 00:24:01,799
You know that look he has on his face.
He's gonna be so disappointed...

452
00:24:01,972 --> 00:24:04,406
...that he left me with this responsibility.
Look, look, look.

453
00:24:04,575 --> 00:24:06,406
What the duck?
All the tapes are like this.

454
00:24:06,577 --> 00:24:08,442
All the tapes.
I tried every tape on this table.

455
00:24:08,612 --> 00:24:11,376
Relax. It's the TV, Mike.

456
00:24:11,549 --> 00:24:12,777
The TV's malfunctioning.

457
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:15,646
- It's not all the videotapes. Think about it.
- Well, show me what it's doing.

458
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,788
Show me how... What was that?

459
00:24:17,955 --> 00:24:21,516
Maybe that's the picture coming back.
Wait, do... What was that?

460
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,551
Why is it doing that?

461
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:28,362
Does that happen when you do it?

462
00:24:28,532 --> 00:24:30,932
No, it hasn't done that at all... Wow.

463
00:24:33,504 --> 00:24:35,301
What is that?

464
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:37,498
Why is it doing that when you do that?

465
00:24:37,675 --> 00:24:38,972
What is wrong with you?

466
00:24:40,144 --> 00:24:42,203
You're magnetized.

467
00:24:42,379 --> 00:24:43,937
You...

468
00:24:44,114 --> 00:24:46,878
You erased these tapes.

469
00:24:47,051 --> 00:24:48,109
It's you.

470
00:24:48,285 --> 00:24:51,345
What happened
during the sabotage attempt, Jerry?

471
00:24:54,425 --> 00:24:59,692
I didn't sabotage the power plant,
the power plant sabotaged me.

472
00:24:59,864 --> 00:25:02,594
Really? The power plant
sabotaged you?

473
00:25:02,766 --> 00:25:04,529
- I'm gonna sabotage you.
- I'm magnetized!

474
00:25:04,702 --> 00:25:06,727
I'm not gonna get... Are you serious?

475
00:25:06,904 --> 00:25:09,236
Sabotage a power plant?
What are you, a superhero?

476
00:25:09,406 --> 00:25:10,771
Don't do this, man.

477
00:25:10,941 --> 00:25:13,068
You were right.

478
00:25:13,244 --> 00:25:15,644
I did have the <i>Driving Miss Daisy</i> tape
at home.

479
00:25:15,813 --> 00:25:17,542
Oh, good, that's really good.

480
00:25:21,952 --> 00:25:24,648
Thank you for returning the tape.

481
00:25:24,822 --> 00:25:26,312
I like your ensemble.

482
00:25:27,291 --> 00:25:30,783
Listen, I wanna rent <i>Ghostbusters.</i>

483
00:25:30,961 --> 00:25:32,326
<i>Ghostbusters.</i>

484
00:25:33,397 --> 00:25:34,557
Is that out?

485
00:25:35,199 --> 00:25:36,427
Isn't that a horror movie?

486
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,624
- Really?
- Yeah.

487
00:25:37,801 --> 00:25:40,099
- That could be interesting.
- Miss Falafelwic<i>z...</i>

488
00:25:40,271 --> 00:25:43,900
- It's Falewic<i>z.</i>
- It's actually got a lot of nudity in it.

489
00:25:44,074 --> 00:25:46,042
- So...
- Oh, you. Come on.

490
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:47,302
You're pulling my leg.

491
00:25:47,478 --> 00:25:49,605
We're right in the middle
of reorganizing.

492
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:52,715
That's why all the tapes are there like that.
We're getting the stock together.

493
00:25:52,883 --> 00:25:54,942
I think you should know
that Mr. Fletcher...

494
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:59,055
...calls me every night at 8 p.m.
just to see how I am.

495
00:25:59,223 --> 00:26:04,126
And I think he would not be pleased
to see his business go off the deep end...

496
00:26:04,295 --> 00:26:08,061
...because some sort of boxing match
going on on his premises.

497
00:26:08,232 --> 00:26:09,699
- Oh, no, no, no.
- I don't think so.

498
00:26:09,867 --> 00:26:11,391
We're not boxing.

499
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:14,561
It's just... You know, it's just buddies...

500
00:26:14,738 --> 00:26:17,969
...just, you know, horsing around.

501
00:26:18,142 --> 00:26:19,871
- Yeah, well...
- It's nothing, just boys.

502
00:26:20,044 --> 00:26:23,104
What I can do is that I can get that to you
first thing tomorrow morning.

503
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,838
No, I don't think so. Uh-uh.

504
00:26:25,015 --> 00:26:27,279
I'm gonna come back before 7,
when you close.

505
00:26:27,451 --> 00:26:29,578
- Oh, okay.
- And I really strongly suggest...

506
00:26:29,753 --> 00:26:34,349
...that you get this place in order fast.
- Okay, well...

507
00:26:35,492 --> 00:26:37,858
- Have a good day.
- Yeah.

508
00:26:42,366 --> 00:26:45,824
She's a communist.
I don't like commies.

509
00:26:47,705 --> 00:26:51,334
- I gotta get some rest, I still feel sick.
- Yeah?

510
00:26:51,508 --> 00:26:52,907
Yeah, me too.

511
00:26:53,077 --> 00:26:54,237
What time is it?

512
00:26:56,313 --> 00:26:57,507
This is a message is for Mark.

513
00:26:57,681 --> 00:27:00,081
I was wondering if you had a copy
of <i>Ghostbusters?</i>

514
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:02,241
Hey, bro, is Pablo around?

515
00:27:02,419 --> 00:27:04,011
I'm under a little bit of pressure here.

516
00:27:04,188 --> 00:27:07,282
Do you have a copy of <i>Ghostbusters</i>
that I could...? That I could borrow?

517
00:27:07,458 --> 00:27:09,392
You do? Yeah, yeah. Uh-huh.

518
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:13,519
No, no, no.
Because I don't need it on DVD.

519
00:27:13,697 --> 00:27:16,825
I need it on... I need it on VHS.

520
00:27:17,001 --> 00:27:20,334
Yeah, well, you know,
they said that about laser discs too so...

521
00:27:20,504 --> 00:27:22,096
Okay, take care.

522
00:27:22,272 --> 00:27:24,069
Shit.

523
00:27:45,629 --> 00:27:49,065
A clear image,
even in the middle of the day.

524
00:27:49,233 --> 00:27:50,860
It's as powerful as the sun.

525
00:27:51,035 --> 00:27:53,765
Excuse me. Excuse me, sir, I'm sorry.

526
00:27:53,937 --> 00:27:56,804
Do you...?
Do you have <i>Ghostbusters</i> on VHS?

527
00:27:56,974 --> 00:27:59,602
There's no VHS here, buddy.

528
00:28:00,377 --> 00:28:02,368
Ho, ho, ho, Little Mikey?

529
00:28:03,113 --> 00:28:04,876
What are you doing here, man?

530
00:28:05,049 --> 00:28:07,449
- You know me?
- Of course I know you, Mike.

531
00:28:07,618 --> 00:28:09,051
Oh, I get it.

532
00:28:09,219 --> 00:28:11,847
Old man Fletcher sent you by here
to get a movie that he's missing.

533
00:28:12,022 --> 00:28:14,286
He's too embarrassed to get it himself.
Ain't that right?

534
00:28:14,458 --> 00:28:16,085
- Now, ain't that right, Little Mikey?
- No, no.

535
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,488
- Yeah, that's right!
- No.

536
00:28:17,661 --> 00:28:19,458
- Okay.
- I call it like I see it.

537
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:22,224
- All right, you take... You take care.
- I got you.

538
00:28:27,438 --> 00:28:30,430
Tell me the truth, doc.
How long have I got left?

539
00:28:30,607 --> 00:28:31,733
Ten minutes.

540
00:28:32,309 --> 00:28:33,833
Ten minutes?

541
00:28:34,011 --> 00:28:36,275
This should help.

542
00:29:10,247 --> 00:29:13,239
<i>Miss Kobayashi had a fever of...</i>

543
00:29:13,417 --> 00:29:16,750
I'm Bill Murray, you're everybody else.

544
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,115
What, are you crazy?
She's never gonna buy it.

545
00:29:19,289 --> 00:29:23,885
Yeah, yeah, yeah. She doesn't know
what the movie's supposed to look like.

546
00:29:24,061 --> 00:29:27,462
The only thing that she knows
is what's on this box.

547
00:29:27,631 --> 00:29:29,326
She's never seen it before.

548
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:33,596
If we stay 10 feet away from the camera
she's not gonna recognize us.

549
00:29:33,771 --> 00:29:36,763
We come up with some special effects,
we do it ourselves.

550
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:39,101
She's gonna be back in, like,
two hours and 45 minutes.

551
00:29:39,276 --> 00:29:41,506
She's on the phone with Fletcher
every night.

552
00:29:41,678 --> 00:29:43,475
The first scene is at the library.

553
00:29:43,647 --> 00:29:46,241
And take that thing off, please.

554
00:29:46,717 --> 00:29:48,207
Okay.

555
00:29:54,091 --> 00:29:56,616
And action.

556
00:29:59,062 --> 00:30:00,723
- Start over. Sorry, cut.
- What?

557
00:30:00,898 --> 00:30:02,024
I looked right in the lens.

558
00:30:02,199 --> 00:30:03,257
- We gotta start over.
- We can't start over.

559
00:30:03,433 --> 00:30:05,401
- I looked right in the lens.
- You just have to do one good take.

560
00:30:05,569 --> 00:30:07,332
All right? Don't...
Listen, what you're doing is good.

561
00:30:07,504 --> 00:30:08,562
- I am doing good, right?
- Just do the same thing.

562
00:30:08,739 --> 00:30:10,229
- Yeah, just do the same thing.
- Am I doing great?

563
00:30:10,407 --> 00:30:12,238
- You're doing great, but don't look...
- All right, you're doing good too...

564
00:30:12,409 --> 00:30:15,207
...with the cinematography.
- All right, thanks. Okay, good.

565
00:30:15,379 --> 00:30:16,505
Go check the cards.

566
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,875
Check the cards.

567
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:23,010
You're doing... That's good, that's right.
That's great. That's good.

568
00:30:23,187 --> 00:30:25,621
- Put your head down, put your head down.
- I can't see.

569
00:30:25,789 --> 00:30:27,723
Go back to the shelf.

570
00:30:29,326 --> 00:30:32,386
Suspecting nothing, and ghosts.
Ghosts.

571
00:30:43,774 --> 00:30:47,403
<i>When you're walking down the street</i>
<i>And you see a little ghost</i>

572
00:30:47,578 --> 00:30:51,014
<i>What you gonna</i>
<i>Do about Ghostbusters?</i>

573
00:30:51,181 --> 00:30:55,083
- What? What? What is that?
- That's the <i>Ghostbusters</i> theme song.

574
00:30:55,686 --> 00:30:57,654
- No.
- I'm pretty sure it is.

575
00:31:12,269 --> 00:31:14,134
- About this stuff...
- We've got one right there.

576
00:31:14,304 --> 00:31:16,272
Let's get a closer look.

577
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,739
Hey, have you talked to Elvis lately?

578
00:31:22,346 --> 00:31:25,509
We're moving on to stage two.
We can capture her.

579
00:31:25,682 --> 00:31:28,651
We have the megapixels.
You just have to stay with me, okay?

580
00:31:28,819 --> 00:31:29,843
- Okay.
- Okay.

581
00:31:38,962 --> 00:31:40,088
Excuse me.

582
00:31:42,065 --> 00:31:46,263
We got her. We did it,
because we're Ghostbusters.

583
00:31:46,436 --> 00:31:47,528
- All right.
- Pound it.

584
00:31:47,704 --> 00:31:50,639
I'm in the hotel reading area
for children...

585
00:31:50,807 --> 00:31:53,037
...and I'm getting a lot of creepy vibes.

586
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:55,405
I think I did hear something.

587
00:31:55,579 --> 00:31:57,979
You heard something?
Stay where you are, I'm on my way.

588
00:32:10,794 --> 00:32:13,422
I got... I got slimed.

589
00:32:18,835 --> 00:32:22,396
Okay, Wilson, go now. Wilson, now!

590
00:32:22,572 --> 00:32:24,096
- Wilson?
- Should I come in now?

591
00:32:24,274 --> 00:32:26,401
- Yes, for duck's sake, now, Wilson.
- I wasn't sure.

592
00:32:26,576 --> 00:32:31,536
If you or any of your family
have seen ectoplasmic apparitions...

593
00:32:31,715 --> 00:32:34,047
...or heard funny noises in your attic...

594
00:32:34,217 --> 00:32:35,548
Call Ghostbusters.

595
00:32:35,719 --> 00:32:38,119
We're fully staffed and ready
24 hours a day...

596
00:32:38,288 --> 00:32:40,415
...to fulfill your supernatural needs.

597
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:43,115
- We're ready to believe you.
- We're ready to believe you.

598
00:32:43,293 --> 00:32:45,352
Look at the refrigerator.

599
00:32:48,131 --> 00:32:51,623
Hello, I need Ghostbusters, fast.
There's a strange alien in my refrigerator.

600
00:32:55,872 --> 00:32:58,898
- Okay, go.
- Rock 'n' roll. How does it look?

601
00:32:59,076 --> 00:33:01,044
- Amazing, very real.
- Hey, come on. Yeah.

602
00:33:01,211 --> 00:33:03,805
Okay, now, the next scene
is the car screeching through the night.

603
00:33:03,981 --> 00:33:05,175
- Okay.
- Well, not night...

604
00:33:05,349 --> 00:33:07,715
...because we're not in the night.
We gotta just go with the day.

605
00:33:07,884 --> 00:33:09,852
No, no, no. All dramatic scenes
are shot at night.

606
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,988
You got... You gotta...
You gotta shoot it at night.

607
00:33:12,155 --> 00:33:15,318
- The day is fine. What are you doing?
- And then, you also have to wet the floor.

608
00:33:15,492 --> 00:33:16,925
- You wet the floor.
- Would you stop?

609
00:33:17,094 --> 00:33:18,823
That's just a waste of water.
Would you stop?

610
00:33:18,996 --> 00:33:20,827
Mike, I'm not gonna botch this job, man.

611
00:33:20,998 --> 00:33:23,364
If you wanna do it in the day,
you'll find somebody else.

612
00:33:23,533 --> 00:33:26,866
Miss Falewicz will be back
in less than an hour. We don't have time.

613
00:33:27,037 --> 00:33:29,699
We just need a minimum amount
of professionalism.

614
00:33:29,873 --> 00:33:32,137
I can shoot a night scene in the day,
give me the camera.

615
00:33:32,309 --> 00:33:33,674
- No.
- Give me the camera.

616
00:33:33,844 --> 00:33:35,243
Let me just show you how you...

617
00:33:36,747 --> 00:33:40,513
You... You cannot touch the camera. You're
gonna erase everything that we've done.

618
00:33:40,684 --> 00:33:44,415
Mike, look on the side of the camera.
There's a button that says, "negative<i>."</i>

619
00:33:44,588 --> 00:33:47,455
See? Makes it look like nighttime
in the day. Am I right?

620
00:33:47,624 --> 00:33:49,455
- Oh, there it goes.
- Thank you, you're welcome.

621
00:33:49,626 --> 00:33:52,891
Your face is negative, though. Don't.

622
00:33:53,063 --> 00:33:55,258
- There's something we can do about that.
- What?

623
00:33:55,432 --> 00:33:57,798
- Okay, go.
- All right.

624
00:33:59,102 --> 00:34:01,730
- Close your eyes.
- You're telling me that now?

625
00:34:01,905 --> 00:34:03,998
Sorry. Good job.

626
00:34:05,142 --> 00:34:10,409
Gotta run,
got a date with a Ghostbuster.

627
00:34:15,385 --> 00:34:16,613
Busting makes me feel good.

628
00:34:17,888 --> 00:34:20,880
Okay, Wilson.

629
00:34:21,858 --> 00:34:25,225
- Ghostbusters, open the door!
- Wait, wait, do it one more time.

630
00:34:25,395 --> 00:34:26,828
Ghostbusters, open the...

631
00:34:26,997 --> 00:34:29,898
Are you the Gatekeeper
or the Keymaster?

632
00:34:30,067 --> 00:34:33,230
Are you the Keymaster?
I want your key inside of me.

633
00:34:33,403 --> 00:34:35,667
- Are you menstruating?
- That's not from the...

634
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:38,433
Back off, I'm the scientist here.

635
00:34:38,608 --> 00:34:41,133
I'm gonna open that refrigerator door.

636
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:50,215
Let's show this prehistoric bitch
how we do things downtown.

637
00:34:50,387 --> 00:34:51,820
We ionized it.

638
00:34:51,988 --> 00:34:54,980
It was a complete particle reversal.

639
00:34:55,625 --> 00:34:56,649
Can I go now?

640
00:34:56,827 --> 00:34:59,489
As the 100-foot marshmallow man
tried to kill them...

641
00:34:59,663 --> 00:35:05,499
...they decided to reverse reality
by crossing their beams.

642
00:35:05,669 --> 00:35:09,332
Run, everyone, run.
There's a Stay Puft Marsh...

643
00:35:12,109 --> 00:35:13,736
Okay.

644
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:17,107
- Nice working with you, Dr. Venkman.
- See you on the other side.

645
00:35:17,681 --> 00:35:22,675
The end. Starring Bill Murray
and other actors.

646
00:35:22,853 --> 00:35:26,755
Written by Dan Aykroyd,
directed by lvan Reitman.

<i>Ghostbusters</i>

648
00:35:29,759 --> 00:35:32,592
Wait, wait. Miss Falewicz,
Miss Falewic<i>z.</i> Hi. Hi.

649
00:35:32,762 --> 00:35:35,322
- I was waiting for you.
- Yeah, I'm here.

650
00:35:35,499 --> 00:35:38,798
By the way, it looks a load better.
Big improvement.

651
00:35:38,969 --> 00:35:41,836
- Oh, yeah. We were just...
- Mr. Fletcher will be pleased.

652
00:35:42,005 --> 00:35:44,166
Yeah, we were doing...
We were doing inventory here.

653
00:35:44,341 --> 00:35:48,505
A nice and tidy house.
First step to combating depression:

654
00:35:48,678 --> 00:35:51,647
- To have an optimistic view of the future.
- Hey, that sounds...

655
00:35:51,815 --> 00:35:53,942
You know what I do
whenever I'm feeling depressed?

656
00:35:54,117 --> 00:35:56,142
- Oh, what's that?
- I clean my house.

657
00:35:56,319 --> 00:35:58,549
- Oh, really?
- Honest to God, it clears the mind.

658
00:35:58,722 --> 00:36:01,486
You'll see, in the morning
when the sun comes in.

659
00:36:01,658 --> 00:36:04,388
- Uh-huh.
- Number one step for fighting depression.

660
00:36:04,561 --> 00:36:07,997
Here it is, Miss Falewicz, there you go.
<i>Ghostbusters</i> like you asked for.

661
00:36:08,165 --> 00:36:09,996
<i>When you're walking down the street</i>

662
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:12,067
- You know what, l...
<i>- And you see a little ghost</i>

663
00:36:12,235 --> 00:36:14,999
- All right.
- I have a... I have a...

664
00:36:15,172 --> 00:36:16,662
I was gonna say I have a...

665
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,308
- What are you doing? I have a method.
<i>- What you gonna do?</i>

666
00:36:19,476 --> 00:36:22,343
- A foolproof method for fighting depression.
<i>- Ghostbusters</i>

667
00:36:22,512 --> 00:36:25,310
You get a notebook
and you, like, put four columns in it.

668
00:36:25,482 --> 00:36:27,177
- And the first column is...
<i>- And you see a little ghost</i>

669
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:28,612
...the effort you believe...
<i>- What you gonna do?</i>

670
00:36:28,785 --> 00:36:30,514
...the dreaded task will take...
<i>- Ghostbusters</i>

671
00:36:30,687 --> 00:36:32,848
Tell me the other two tomorrow,
because I'm really...

672
00:36:33,023 --> 00:36:35,355
- Good movie you got there.
- I'm focused on those first two.

673
00:36:35,525 --> 00:36:37,755
Wait a sec, 1 dollar, one tape,
one night, right?

674
00:36:37,928 --> 00:36:40,055
- No, Miss Falewicz, it's not a problem.
- I'm in it.

675
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:42,130
- It's okay. That's on us today.
- Really?

676
00:36:42,299 --> 00:36:43,323
- Uh-huh.
- Thank you.

677
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:47,527
- You're welcome. Take care.
- Enjoy the movie.

678
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:53,239
We should've had, like, a premiere
of that thing or something.

679
00:36:54,444 --> 00:36:56,105
- What?
- What are you talking about, "what"?

680
00:36:56,279 --> 00:36:58,338
She's not supposed to know
that we're in the movie...

681
00:36:58,515 --> 00:37:00,380
...because we're not in <i>Ghostbusters.</i>
- Yeah? Maybe I want her to know...

682
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:02,677
- Maybe I am in <i>Ghostbusters.</i>
- Why is it...?

683
00:37:02,852 --> 00:37:05,286
- Because I'm proud of my work.
- Oh, you're...

684
00:37:05,455 --> 00:37:08,288
- Oh, my God.
- Mike, you have zero ambition.

685
00:37:08,458 --> 00:37:10,585
- What's...?
- That's your problem.

686
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:14,127
You're gonna be stuck in this dump
for the rest of your life.

687
00:37:14,297 --> 00:37:15,958
Good night.

688
00:37:17,601 --> 00:37:19,796
Wh...? What? What? What's a dump?

689
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:21,862
What's a dump?
My... My shop is a dump?

690
00:37:22,038 --> 00:37:23,232
You live in a junkyard.

691
00:37:23,406 --> 00:37:26,864
Not just the store,
the whole city is a swamp.

692
00:37:27,043 --> 00:37:31,002
- It's a swamp now?
- Yeah, a dump swamp.

693
00:37:31,848 --> 00:37:34,180
When you get stuck here,
you're stuck for life.

694
00:37:34,351 --> 00:37:39,220
Come on, Mike, what is so great
about this town? Huh?

695
00:37:40,123 --> 00:37:42,819
- The people.
- The people?

696
00:37:42,993 --> 00:37:45,962
You're gonna make me cry.
The people.

697
00:37:46,129 --> 00:37:49,565
The only reason there's anybody here
is because they have nowhere to go.

698
00:37:49,733 --> 00:37:53,362
Why don't you...? Why don't you
go somewhere, Mr<i>. "</i>Junkman"?

699
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:56,733
We got a customer. We got a customer.

700
00:37:56,906 --> 00:37:59,397
- Mr... Mr. Jack.
- Hi, how you doing?

701
00:37:59,576 --> 00:38:01,771
Yeah, actually, we're closed.

702
00:38:01,945 --> 00:38:05,005
- I'm actually open later...
- It'll just take a moment, guys.

703
00:38:05,181 --> 00:38:07,081
<i>- Rush Hour 2,</i> that's all.
- Excellent choice.

704
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:10,515
It's out. But you come back tomorrow,
and I can... I can get you <i>Ghostbusters.</i>

705
00:38:10,687 --> 00:38:13,212
Seen it<i>. Jaws?</i>

706
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:16,086
- Whoa, what the duck?
- Whoa, what was that?

707
00:38:19,863 --> 00:38:22,388
How about <i>Towering Inferno?</i>

708
00:38:22,565 --> 00:38:24,328
- I saw it.
- Mr. Jack...

709
00:38:24,501 --> 00:38:26,025
...if you just come back tomorrow.

710
00:38:26,202 --> 00:38:28,898
l... I'll take care of all of that tomorrow,
okay, Mr. Jack?

711
00:38:29,072 --> 00:38:32,269
I can't believe you don't have <i>Rush Hour 2.</i>
I'm gonna go to West Coast Video.

712
00:38:32,442 --> 00:38:34,467
No, you... No, you're not.
Dude, you'd better...

713
00:38:34,644 --> 00:38:37,511
You don't do that, you...
Have some morals.

714
00:38:37,681 --> 00:38:40,946
Just wait till tomorrow.
I'll have <i>Rush Hour 2</i> tomorrow.

715
00:38:41,117 --> 00:38:42,516
Good!

716
00:38:53,263 --> 00:38:55,163
Lee, I'm coming.

717
00:38:58,601 --> 00:39:00,501
I'm taking the stairs.

718
00:39:01,104 --> 00:39:02,366
Lee.

719
00:39:02,539 --> 00:39:03,597
Lee.

720
00:39:03,773 --> 00:39:04,797
Cut, that was great.

721
00:39:19,923 --> 00:39:21,550
Lee!

722
00:39:21,725 --> 00:39:24,853
- Over here.
- Lee, what you doing down there, man?

723
00:39:25,028 --> 00:39:26,859
Carter, behind you.
Behind you, look out.

724
00:39:32,268 --> 00:39:35,669
Lee, this Chinese bamboo
ain't gonna hold.

725
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:40,640
Don't worry, Carter,
Chinese bamboo, very strong.

726
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:52,180
This Chinese bamboo ain't strong.
I can't believe you got me out here.

727
00:39:52,355 --> 00:39:56,223
Forget about the bamboo.
We gotta go solve a crime.

728
00:39:58,762 --> 00:40:01,253
Go in for the kiss now, Jerry.
Go in for the kiss.

729
00:40:01,431 --> 00:40:03,797
Go in for the kiss now.
Go now, kiss him now.

730
00:40:03,967 --> 00:40:05,366
Hold on.

731
00:40:06,035 --> 00:40:08,595
Why do I have to kiss Wilson?

732
00:40:08,772 --> 00:40:10,797
- She's the bad guy, right?
- Right.

733
00:40:10,974 --> 00:40:13,636
She's got the detonator...
He's got the detonator in his hand.

734
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:15,437
You have the bomb in your mouth.

735
00:40:15,612 --> 00:40:17,876
You have to press it against her
to keep her from blowing your head off.

736
00:40:18,047 --> 00:40:19,742
- I'm not kissing Wilson.
- It's not a kiss!

737
00:40:19,916 --> 00:40:22,817
I don't wanna kiss Wilson.

738
00:40:24,521 --> 00:40:27,081
We've been working with him all day.
We can't replace him.

739
00:40:27,257 --> 00:40:28,622
- Could I just say something?
- What?

740
00:40:28,792 --> 00:40:30,453
I quit.

741
00:40:31,127 --> 00:40:33,960
- Amateurs. I hate this movie.
- Wilson...

742
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:35,791
Thanks, good work today.

743
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:37,691
Mike.

744
00:40:37,867 --> 00:40:40,062
Mike, Mike. Listen to me.

745
00:40:40,236 --> 00:40:42,932
Maybe you can understand that
I don't want the whole neighborhood...

746
00:40:43,106 --> 00:40:47,202
...to think I'm having a homosexual,
interracial relationship with my mechanic.

747
00:40:47,377 --> 00:40:48,605
Oh. Okay.

748
00:40:48,778 --> 00:40:52,043
- So the interracial is the issue.
- Okay, forget about the interracial thing...

749
00:40:52,215 --> 00:40:56,811
...but kissing my mechanic is disturbing
and inappropriate.

750
00:40:56,986 --> 00:40:59,284
He could sue me
for sexual harassment.

751
00:40:59,456 --> 00:41:01,117
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay, come on.

752
00:41:01,291 --> 00:41:04,317
Mike, Mike, Mike. I got a better idea.

753
00:41:04,794 --> 00:41:06,421
Follow me.

754
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:10,395
Right, yeah,
There's a stain on this sweater.

755
00:41:10,567 --> 00:41:12,296
- Okay. Okay.
- You see what I'm talking about?

756
00:41:12,469 --> 00:41:14,266
Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt.

757
00:41:14,437 --> 00:41:18,305
We're moviemakers and we're making
a movie around the corner.

758
00:41:18,475 --> 00:41:20,807
And we have a kissing scene,
and we need an actress...

759
00:41:20,977 --> 00:41:22,808
...and you are amazing.

760
00:41:22,979 --> 00:41:25,812
I'm sorry, I can't leave the store.

761
00:41:25,982 --> 00:41:28,348
I have work to do, but my sister can.

762
00:41:28,518 --> 00:41:30,486
- Alma.
- What?

763
00:41:30,653 --> 00:41:31,677
Come here.

764
00:41:32,655 --> 00:41:35,818
These guys are making a film
around the corner. They need a girl.

765
00:41:35,992 --> 00:41:37,482
What kind of film are you making?

766
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:40,595
Actually it's like comedy,
action, adventure.

767
00:41:40,763 --> 00:41:43,425
- Like, the types of movies, you know...
- I don't think you understand...

768
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,965
- Like what kind?
...what we're offering you, though.

769
00:41:45,134 --> 00:41:48,433
- We want you to be a movie star.
- I told you I have to stay here.

770
00:41:48,605 --> 00:41:51,335
I can't leave, but she should go,
she's a really good actress.

771
00:41:51,508 --> 00:41:54,341
- I was in the school play.
- She was a fridge.

772
00:41:54,511 --> 00:41:56,536
- A refrigerator?
- Yeah.

773
00:41:56,713 --> 00:41:58,908
So check it out.
Okay, so I'm standing in the kitchen...

774
00:41:59,082 --> 00:42:00,174
...and this is my door.

775
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:03,842
And then I had, like, to close my eye
like this, and I go like that.

776
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:06,079
- Okay, we're gonna take a quick meeting.
- That was the light.

777
00:42:06,256 --> 00:42:07,450
- A quick producers' meeting.
- It's the light.

778
00:42:07,624 --> 00:42:09,216
- You got it.
- She's horrible.

779
00:42:09,392 --> 00:42:11,690
- What's the matter? She's...
- She's the worst actress I've ever seen.

780
00:42:11,861 --> 00:42:13,192
Listen to me, I know a woman...

781
00:42:13,363 --> 00:42:15,593
...who works across the street
at the diner, she's per...

782
00:42:15,765 --> 00:42:19,030
Are you gonna kiss her or Wilson?
Because that's what it is at this point.

783
00:42:19,202 --> 00:42:21,261
- You gonna kiss her?
- I hate you right now.

784
00:42:21,437 --> 00:42:23,234
Okay, we did it.

785
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,505
- Guess what, we just had a meeting.
- Yeah?

786
00:42:25,675 --> 00:42:27,472
- You got the part.
- I got the part?

787
00:42:27,644 --> 00:42:29,578
- Oh, yeah.
- So we should... We should go now...

788
00:42:29,746 --> 00:42:30,804
...because we're actually...

789
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:32,004
- We're shooting right now.
- Thank you so much.

790
00:42:32,181 --> 00:42:34,615
It's gonna be fun.
We're gonna makes some movies.

791
00:42:34,784 --> 00:42:36,342
I'm sorry, can...? Can...? Can...?

792
00:42:36,519 --> 00:42:37,543
- Is this yours?
- Yes, it is.

793
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,018
- Can we use this just really quickly?
- No, no, no.

794
00:42:40,189 --> 00:42:43,056
- She just dropped this off to be cleaned.
- Just really, really quickly.

795
00:42:43,226 --> 00:42:44,693
- It'll be all right.
- You don't have to do that.

796
00:42:44,861 --> 00:42:47,091
We'll bring it back.
We'll make sure it's in fine condition.

797
00:42:47,263 --> 00:42:48,355
- What's your name?
- Ann.

798
00:42:48,531 --> 00:42:49,725
Ann. Miss Ann. Thank you so much.

799
00:42:49,899 --> 00:42:51,628
We gotta make sure
she gets a wardrobe credit.

800
00:42:51,801 --> 00:42:54,201
She will get a credit for sure,
and then some.

801
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:55,462
- I'm gonna be thinking about...
- Thank you.

802
00:42:55,638 --> 00:42:57,265
...parts for you in the future
of our films.

803
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,805
Not you, however. You blew it.

804
00:42:58,975 --> 00:43:00,567
I wanted to make you Marilyn Monroe.

805
00:43:00,743 --> 00:43:02,438
- Now you're just gonna be the cleaner.
- Okay, let's go. Thank you.

806
00:43:02,612 --> 00:43:06,309
- Thank you for letting us use your sister.
- Alma, keep your tongue in your mouth.

807
00:43:06,482 --> 00:43:08,211
- We're gonna go down here.
- It's <i>Rush Hour 2...</i>

808
00:43:08,384 --> 00:43:09,976
...and you're gonna play the girl.

809
00:43:10,153 --> 00:43:11,916
Action, guys.

810
00:43:14,324 --> 00:43:15,655
What...?

811
00:43:16,059 --> 00:43:17,458
- Oh, damn. Damn.
- What was that?

812
00:43:18,761 --> 00:43:20,058
Hold still.

813
00:43:20,663 --> 00:43:21,891
- Stop.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

814
00:43:22,065 --> 00:43:26,092
He got exposed to radioactive waves.

815
00:43:26,269 --> 00:43:27,896
Are you radioactive?

816
00:43:28,071 --> 00:43:30,062
Is it contagious?
Am I gonna be radioactive now?

817
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:34,073
Not radioactive! Magnetized!

818
00:43:34,243 --> 00:43:35,267
Give me my bottle.

819
00:43:36,512 --> 00:43:40,004
I'm sorry, we didn't have a chance to...
It's not contagious.

820
00:43:40,617 --> 00:43:43,211
I'm just gonna check...
Sorry. You're fine.

821
00:43:43,386 --> 00:43:45,115
- This came out pretty good.
- I'm fine?

822
00:43:45,288 --> 00:43:47,051
- Not magnetized.
- Uh-huh, yeah. Okay, good.

823
00:43:47,223 --> 00:43:49,748
- Not magnetized.
- What about your friend?

824
00:43:49,926 --> 00:43:51,018
Huh?

825
00:43:52,195 --> 00:43:54,629
Hey, Jerry. I'm really sorry
about hurting your feelings.

826
00:43:54,797 --> 00:43:57,357
I just, like... I got really scared
about the radioactive stuff.

827
00:43:57,534 --> 00:44:00,128
Yeah, I know.
It's my fault, I should've warned you.

828
00:44:00,303 --> 00:44:01,702
Yeah.

829
00:44:04,974 --> 00:44:06,168
Is that you?

830
00:44:07,043 --> 00:44:09,409
- I took the whole bottle.
- Why would you do that, Jerry?

831
00:44:09,579 --> 00:44:12,173
I just wanted to go to sleep.
Am I gonna die?

832
00:44:12,348 --> 00:44:16,250
Yeah, it's aspirin, not sleeping pills,
you dummy. Why be a dummy?

833
00:44:16,419 --> 00:44:18,853
You are not going to die, okay?

834
00:44:19,022 --> 00:44:20,887
- lf you do what I say, okay?
- What's happening?

835
00:44:21,057 --> 00:44:22,456
I need you to go to the bathroom...

836
00:44:22,625 --> 00:44:24,525
...get me a bucket full of salt and water,
right now.

837
00:44:24,694 --> 00:44:27,424
- Salt, salt.
- Okay?

838
00:44:27,597 --> 00:44:29,189
Just sit down, relax.

839
00:44:29,999 --> 00:44:32,058
- I'm gonna die.
- No, you're not gonna die, I promise.

840
00:44:32,235 --> 00:44:33,964
- I've done it before.
- I have a good future.

841
00:44:34,137 --> 00:44:37,436
Here, here. Drink it, drink it.

842
00:44:39,976 --> 00:44:41,466
Good.

843
00:44:42,545 --> 00:44:45,275
- You okay?
- That was good.

844
00:44:45,448 --> 00:44:48,542
Hey, look at me, I'm doing good.

845
00:44:48,718 --> 00:44:49,980
Oh, that's me.

846
00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:55,149
Oh, not again.

847
00:44:55,992 --> 00:44:58,893
Why does he have to puke
outside of the shop every time?

848
00:44:59,062 --> 00:45:00,996
Oh, good, now he's gonna
puke out all the bad stuff.

849
00:45:01,164 --> 00:45:03,632
- You see?
- But in front of the shop?

850
00:45:04,734 --> 00:45:06,395
Hi. Sorry.

851
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:09,930
Wait, what's he doing now?

852
00:45:12,709 --> 00:45:15,940
Oh, nice, nice. Pee.

853
00:45:16,112 --> 00:45:18,103
- You guys are so weird.
- It all came out in my pee.

854
00:45:18,281 --> 00:45:19,646
Yeah.

855
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:22,181
Is his pee making it do that?

856
00:45:24,721 --> 00:45:26,052
Thank God for my bladder.

857
00:45:26,222 --> 00:45:28,315
Okay, good. Would you just finish
and come inside?

858
00:45:28,491 --> 00:45:30,789
Alma, I owe you one.

859
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,588
Let's test it out. Let's test it out.

860
00:45:33,763 --> 00:45:35,958
Let's test it out.
Is it warping the image still?

861
00:45:36,132 --> 00:45:37,997
- No. No.
- No? No?

862
00:45:38,167 --> 00:45:40,829
- It worked. It's working.
- I'm demagnetized, you're a genius.

863
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:42,335
- Thanks to me.
- You saved my life.

864
00:45:42,505 --> 00:45:45,167
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Mr. Jack.

865
00:45:45,341 --> 00:45:47,332
- What are you looking at?
- Oh, nothing.

866
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:50,001
We were just closing up, actually.

867
00:45:50,179 --> 00:45:52,647
Yeah, so there it is.

868
00:45:52,815 --> 00:45:55,875
I have to pay in mostly pennies.
That's okay?

869
00:45:56,052 --> 00:45:57,713
- Fine. That's... That's okay.
- Thank you.

870
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:59,047
- Thank you.
- Enjoy the movie.

871
00:45:59,222 --> 00:46:00,655
Your pennies are always good here.

872
00:46:00,823 --> 00:46:02,688
I'm gonna enjoy it, thank you.

873
00:46:02,859 --> 00:46:03,917
Good night.

874
00:46:04,093 --> 00:46:06,254
- Enjoy the movie?
- Yeah, enjoy the movie.

875
00:46:06,429 --> 00:46:08,021
We worked hard on it.
It's gonna be good.

876
00:46:08,197 --> 00:46:11,098
Yo, we gotta find new tapes.
We're gonna get caught.

877
00:46:11,267 --> 00:46:12,564
- We can't keep doing this.
- What are you talking about?

878
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:13,827
It's going fine. So far, so good.

879
00:46:14,003 --> 00:46:17,769
What? When Miss Falewicz
sees <i>"Ghostbusters"?</i>

880
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:20,738
- Our version is better than the original.
- She's gonna say something...

881
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:24,539
...to Mr. Fletcher. First of all,
our version is only 20 minutes.

882
00:46:24,714 --> 00:46:27,581
Yeah, but 20 minutes,
it's all the brain can concentrate for.

883
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:29,911
It's the perfect duration.
It's a biological fact.

884
00:46:30,086 --> 00:46:31,348
- I study this, I know.
- Yeah.

885
00:46:31,521 --> 00:46:34,786
And besides, Miss Falewicz has never seen
a science-fiction movie before.

886
00:46:34,957 --> 00:46:38,256
She might think all of them are 20 minutes
long. And isn't she a little kooky?

887
00:46:38,428 --> 00:46:40,521
She probably won't even recognize us.

888
00:46:44,334 --> 00:46:46,632
Y'all need to chill out, all right?

889
00:46:48,271 --> 00:46:49,329
Craig?

890
00:46:50,473 --> 00:46:52,373
- What's up, old lady?
- Yo, come on in, guys.

891
00:46:52,542 --> 00:46:54,703
Yo, Craig. What's up, man?

892
00:46:59,115 --> 00:47:01,447
Dude, you gotta check this out, man.

893
00:47:01,617 --> 00:47:05,109
My auntie got this
from Fats' video store.

894
00:47:05,288 --> 00:47:06,721
This is <i>Ghostbusters.</i>

895
00:47:06,889 --> 00:47:08,686
- Roshambo.
- Water.

896
00:47:08,858 --> 00:47:10,348
- Laser.
- Water.

897
00:47:10,526 --> 00:47:13,188
- Whoa. Uh-oh.
- Oh, no.

898
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:15,661
Miss Falewicz gave it to her nephew.

899
00:47:16,733 --> 00:47:18,758
It looks like they were disappointed
with the video.

900
00:47:18,935 --> 00:47:20,800
- Come on, guys.
- Do they have guns?

901
00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:24,269
I can clearly see you
hiding behind the counter.

902
00:47:26,776 --> 00:47:29,301
We was closed,
something's wrong with these lights.

903
00:47:29,479 --> 00:47:30,503
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

904
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:33,171
Y'all open now.

905
00:47:38,988 --> 00:47:41,752
That wasn't bad. What else y'all got?

906
00:47:41,924 --> 00:47:44,119
- The whole store.
- No. No.

907
00:47:44,293 --> 00:47:47,262
We actually...
We only have <i>Rush Hour 2.</i>

908
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:50,263
No, man, he said the whole store.

909
00:47:50,433 --> 00:47:52,264
- Why you lie to me, man?
- I'm not lying.

910
00:47:52,435 --> 00:47:53,925
Guys, make your choice.

911
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,538
- What is wrong with you?
- It just came out.

912
00:48:02,278 --> 00:48:04,007
What you got?

913
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:05,807
Right. Yeah, that's for...

914
00:48:05,982 --> 00:48:09,213
Hey, man, hand me one of them
little mint jump off, right there.

915
00:48:09,385 --> 00:48:12,183
We'd love to rent you out
these videos today...

916
00:48:12,355 --> 00:48:15,051
...but Mr. Fletcher, right, he called.

917
00:48:15,224 --> 00:48:17,158
- Oh, yeah.
- We got the new policy.

918
00:48:17,326 --> 00:48:20,727
Two videos per day, per account, so...

919
00:48:20,897 --> 00:48:22,865
All right then,
let me open an account right now.

920
00:48:23,032 --> 00:48:24,727
Yeah, man. Sign away.

921
00:48:24,901 --> 00:48:28,735
We're gonna need your picture I D,
your phone bill...

922
00:48:28,905 --> 00:48:31,100
...your last three rent receipts,
your grades...

923
00:48:31,274 --> 00:48:33,174
...a letter from your mother
if you're a minor...

924
00:48:33,342 --> 00:48:35,742
...the last three countries
you visited prior to this trip...

925
00:48:35,912 --> 00:48:38,176
...your 10 favorite films
and your blood type.

926
00:48:38,347 --> 00:48:40,542
You know, you're real lucky
we don't beat up girls.

927
00:48:40,716 --> 00:48:42,411
- Word.
- For real.

928
00:48:42,585 --> 00:48:44,678
Except Craig's aunt.

929
00:48:44,854 --> 00:48:46,651
Shut up, stupid.

930
00:48:46,823 --> 00:48:49,053
We'll be back
with all the necessary documents.

931
00:48:49,525 --> 00:48:51,993
We still have two to choose, right?

932
00:48:52,161 --> 00:48:54,595
Here you go,
you pick two of those and we'll be...

933
00:48:54,764 --> 00:48:56,163
That's my choice.

934
00:48:56,332 --> 00:48:57,959
- You guys pick the other one.
- No, no, no.

935
00:48:58,134 --> 00:49:00,364
You get to pick your choice,
and we gotta fight over ours?

936
00:49:00,536 --> 00:49:01,969
- Yeah.
- What kind of democracy is that?

937
00:49:02,138 --> 00:49:04,800
Man, who told you
this was a democracy?

938
00:49:04,974 --> 00:49:06,737
Hey, hey, you guys, you guys.

939
00:49:06,909 --> 00:49:10,242
You guys, listen. You guys!

940
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:14,739
Life without civilization is brutal...

941
00:49:14,917 --> 00:49:19,354
... nasty and short.

942
00:49:19,522 --> 00:49:20,921
If you're gonna come around here...

943
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:25,789
...and spread pi<i>zz</i>a
all over the walls with gats...

944
00:49:25,962 --> 00:49:27,862
...you're gonna miss out
on some good movies.

945
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:29,930
So this is what I'm saying.

946
00:49:30,099 --> 00:49:32,192
I'm gonna put all of these videos
into this bag.

947
00:49:32,702 --> 00:49:36,331
Alma, you're gonna pick out
two of these videos at random.

948
00:49:36,506 --> 00:49:38,997
Totally random.
It's the only way to do it civilized.

949
00:49:39,442 --> 00:49:43,902
And everyone will survive. Pick it out.
Shake it, shake it, shake it.

950
00:49:44,714 --> 00:49:47,012
- Here they are.
- These are your choices.

951
00:49:47,183 --> 00:49:48,650
Done.

952
00:49:48,818 --> 00:49:50,217
How the hell?

953
00:49:50,386 --> 00:49:54,015
Okay, who's the baby
that picked <i>The Lion King?</i> Hm?

954
00:49:54,423 --> 00:49:56,015
Someone did.

955
00:50:00,062 --> 00:50:01,120
- What?
- Yeah.

956
00:50:01,297 --> 00:50:04,289
But we will have them for you
at 4 p.m. tomorrow...

957
00:50:04,467 --> 00:50:07,027
...as long as you give us
$20 right now.

958
00:50:07,203 --> 00:50:09,501
Twenty dollars?
Yo, that's a complete rip-off.

959
00:50:09,672 --> 00:50:12,607
No, no, no.
These are custom made. Sweded.

960
00:50:12,775 --> 00:50:16,871
- Sweded.
- It's a very rare type of video.

961
00:50:17,046 --> 00:50:19,071
- Swede? Like Sweden?
- Yeah, Sweded.

962
00:50:19,248 --> 00:50:23,184
- It's a country, not a verb.
- Exactly. That's why it's expensive.

963
00:50:23,352 --> 00:50:26,583
Because it's a faraway,
expensive country.

964
00:50:26,756 --> 00:50:28,053
- It's imported.
- Sweded.

965
00:50:29,926 --> 00:50:34,625
A toast. Twenty bucks in one day.
That's never happened at Be Kind Rewind.

966
00:50:34,797 --> 00:50:35,889
- That's never happened. Never.
- Never happened at all?

967
00:50:36,065 --> 00:50:38,556
- Nice with the civilization theory.
- Right?

968
00:50:38,734 --> 00:50:40,167
- I gotta say, that was nice.
- I pulled that out.

969
00:50:40,336 --> 00:50:42,463
I do some thinking at night.

970
00:50:42,638 --> 00:50:45,198
If I can't sleep,
I'm just thinking about stuff.

971
00:50:45,374 --> 00:50:47,842
- Who picked <i>The Lion King?</i>
- That's what I was wondering.

972
00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:51,275
The big guy, maybe.
One of those guys picked <i>The Lion King.</i>

973
00:50:51,447 --> 00:50:52,675
It was me.

974
00:50:52,848 --> 00:50:54,475
- You snuck it in there?
- Yeah.

975
00:50:54,650 --> 00:50:55,947
You're a badass.

976
00:50:56,118 --> 00:50:58,643
See, well, <i>Pocahontas</i> used to be,
like, my favorite movie, right?

977
00:50:58,821 --> 00:51:01,051
But then I couldn't find it
when you got the bag idea...

978
00:51:01,223 --> 00:51:02,918
...so I just picked <i>Lion King</i> instead.

979
00:51:03,092 --> 00:51:08,029
It is such a good movie too.
I cry every time when the father dies.

980
00:51:08,197 --> 00:51:11,291
Oh, man, I love <i>The Lion King</i> too.
It's my favorite picture, man.

981
00:51:12,001 --> 00:51:13,662
My mom loved it.

982
00:51:13,836 --> 00:51:15,303
- It's awesome.
- You like it too?

983
00:51:15,471 --> 00:51:17,371
- Yeah, it's awesome.
- It's deeply deep.

984
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:19,098
- Oh, yeah.
- Because the uncle...

985
00:51:19,275 --> 00:51:22,039
...kills the nephew's father.
- His father...

986
00:51:22,211 --> 00:51:24,008
...which is his brother.
- That's his brother.

987
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:27,707
He kills his own brother, right?
That's some heavy, Shapeskearian shit.

988
00:51:28,117 --> 00:51:29,414
What's funny?

989
00:51:29,585 --> 00:51:31,246
- Shape... Nothing.
- Well, you know...

990
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:34,719
Does anybody have any ideas,
<i>Lion King</i> lady...

991
00:51:34,890 --> 00:51:38,485
...about how we're supposed to shoot
an animated film?

992
00:51:38,661 --> 00:51:42,927
Roar! I am the king!

993
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:45,829
Roar! Jerry, I kind of see your head.

994
00:51:46,002 --> 00:51:47,196
- What?
- It doesn't look real.

995
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:49,338
Well, Alma, stay on the voices.

996
00:51:49,505 --> 00:51:51,234
We'll be in charge
of the bodies and motion.

997
00:51:51,407 --> 00:51:52,669
- Okay.
- I need you to say this:

998
00:51:52,842 --> 00:51:56,209
"I'm gonna piss on the graves
of your ancestors<i>. "</i>

999
00:51:56,379 --> 00:51:57,937
- It's important in the story, Alma.
- Don't say that.

1000
00:51:58,114 --> 00:51:59,308
Roar!

1001
00:51:59,482 --> 00:52:02,542
I'm going to piss
on the heads of your ancestors!

1002
00:52:02,718 --> 00:52:04,618
No, wait. Hold on.
This is a children's movie.

1003
00:52:04,787 --> 00:52:07,984
This is the sequel.
We're doing part two.

1004
00:52:14,263 --> 00:52:15,890
Less choice...

1005
00:52:16,065 --> 00:52:19,933
...more copies of the same movie.

1006
00:52:20,803 --> 00:52:24,671
Simplified categorization of genre.

1007
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:25,932
Sir?

1008
00:52:26,108 --> 00:52:27,132
Hi.

1009
00:52:27,309 --> 00:52:32,042
Noticeable outfit
and big badge on employee.

1010
00:52:32,214 --> 00:52:34,114
Sir, are you sure I can't help you?

1011
00:52:34,283 --> 00:52:38,219
You've been here for the last two hours,
you can't seem to make up your mind.

1012
00:52:39,288 --> 00:52:40,721
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

1013
00:52:40,890 --> 00:52:43,950
Do you carry a copy
of <i>Stormy Weather?</i>

1014
00:52:44,126 --> 00:52:46,356
- What?
- No specific...

1015
00:52:46,529 --> 00:52:51,466
...knowledge required.

1016
00:52:52,234 --> 00:52:53,258
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1017
00:52:53,436 --> 00:52:55,063
Okay. Very helpful.

1018
00:52:57,373 --> 00:52:58,465
- That's it.
- Shoot him, Robo.

1019
00:52:58,641 --> 00:53:00,734
I'm taking you downtown.

1020
00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:03,242
- I'm coming to get you now...
- Well, you're gonna get shot.

1021
00:53:03,412 --> 00:53:05,380
...with my gun.

1022
00:53:05,548 --> 00:53:07,140
And there's more
where that came from...

1023
00:53:07,316 --> 00:53:08,908
- No!
...for you, cop lady.

1024
00:53:11,387 --> 00:53:12,513
Y'all still shooting, man?

1025
00:53:12,688 --> 00:53:13,712
- Yeah, we...
- Four o' clock.

1026
00:53:13,889 --> 00:53:16,687
Y'all were supposed to be done.
I've been out there for 20 minutes.

1027
00:53:16,859 --> 00:53:19,157
- Don't worry. I can handle this guy.
- No, no, I got it, man.

1028
00:53:19,328 --> 00:53:21,023
- Let me show you how to do this, man.
- We almost done.

1029
00:53:21,197 --> 00:53:24,997
I will shoot you
and I know robot karate.

1030
00:53:25,167 --> 00:53:26,498
I got something for you, man.

1031
00:53:26,669 --> 00:53:28,830
What do you think you're...?
I'll take you to the...

1032
00:53:29,905 --> 00:53:31,202
- Robo!
- Yeah.

1033
00:53:31,373 --> 00:53:33,773
- You want some? Yeah, you want some?
- No.

1034
00:53:34,376 --> 00:53:36,173
- Stay back.
- I'm wounded!

1035
00:53:36,345 --> 00:53:37,937
I'm giving you
till the count of three...

1036
00:53:38,114 --> 00:53:39,775
...to drop your weapon.
- Yeah, uh-huh.

1037
00:53:44,186 --> 00:53:46,484
That's not funny, y'all.

1038
00:53:46,655 --> 00:53:47,883
- Cut.
- Whatever, y'all.

1039
00:53:48,057 --> 00:53:50,958
- It's kind of funny.
- No, it's part of the movie.

1040
00:53:51,127 --> 00:53:52,560
- That was good.
- It went really well.

1041
00:53:52,728 --> 00:53:54,696
- I like your badge.
- Thanks, I made it myself.

1042
00:53:54,864 --> 00:53:57,924
Great. Just... Who are these people?

1043
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:00,261
- Oh, my God.
- Let's go.

1044
00:54:06,542 --> 00:54:07,634
Let's go before they see us.

1045
00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:10,301
Mike! Mike! Over here!

1046
00:54:10,479 --> 00:54:13,039
Lookit, okay? You're gonna smile.

1047
00:54:13,215 --> 00:54:15,410
Pretend like you know
what you're doing, okay?

1048
00:54:15,584 --> 00:54:17,313
- I'm gonna take care of the rest. Yes.
- No.

1049
00:54:17,486 --> 00:54:18,919
This was really great...

1050
00:54:19,088 --> 00:54:21,318
...but it's too short.
It's so good, it should be longer.

1051
00:54:21,657 --> 00:54:23,955
Anyway, I told all my friends,
and they're excited.

1052
00:54:24,126 --> 00:54:26,321
- They want to join the store.
- Bring them in.

1053
00:54:26,495 --> 00:54:27,723
Okay.

1054
00:54:27,897 --> 00:54:29,922
Okay, it's open!

1055
00:54:30,099 --> 00:54:31,532
Form two lines.

1056
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:35,136
Rentals on the right
and returns on the left.

1057
00:54:35,304 --> 00:54:36,532
The store policy is also...

1058
00:54:36,705 --> 00:54:38,730
...two rentals per customer.

1059
00:54:38,908 --> 00:54:41,069
Maybe you'd like to get a film
you didn't know about.

1060
00:54:42,478 --> 00:54:44,810
Okay, guys, I'm accepting applications
in this line right here.

1061
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:46,311
- Hi.
- Hi.

1062
00:54:46,482 --> 00:54:48,507
- What would you like?
- This one Sweded, please.

1063
00:54:48,684 --> 00:54:51,346
Okay. Let me just check to see
if you have the proper documents.

1064
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:54,284
It seems like you have a lot of Cs.

1065
00:54:55,524 --> 00:54:57,515
I don't even think
you really should have passed.

1066
00:54:57,693 --> 00:55:00,662
So we're gonna need a $20
supplement fee for averageness.

1067
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:02,092
- Are you insane? Twenty dollars?
- I'm sorry.

1068
00:55:02,264 --> 00:55:03,561
I don't make the rules,
I just have to enforce them.

1069
00:55:03,732 --> 00:55:05,097
You're crazy. You're insane.

1070
00:55:05,267 --> 00:55:06,996
- I'm leaving.
- You can bend a rule a little.

1071
00:55:07,169 --> 00:55:09,729
- Your movies suck anyway!
- No.

1072
00:55:09,905 --> 00:55:11,338
Next!

1073
00:55:11,507 --> 00:55:13,941
- Excuse me.
- Jerry.

1074
00:55:14,109 --> 00:55:15,804
I am RoboCop.

1075
00:55:16,212 --> 00:55:18,544
I heard there was a disturbance...

1076
00:55:18,714 --> 00:55:21,706
...at Be Kind Rewind video store.

1077
00:55:21,884 --> 00:55:24,114
Mr. RoboCop,
may I have an autograph, please?

1078
00:55:24,286 --> 00:55:25,810
- For my grandson?
- Me too, me too.

1079
00:55:25,988 --> 00:55:30,982
Anything you say
can and will be held against you...

1080
00:55:31,894 --> 00:55:33,623
...in a court of RoboCop.

1081
00:55:34,163 --> 00:55:35,187
Miss Falewic<i>z.</i>

1082
00:55:38,334 --> 00:55:39,961
- Hi, Miss Falewic<i>z.</i>
- Yeah.

1083
00:55:40,135 --> 00:55:43,730
- Can you Swede this for me?
- Oh, <i>Driving Miss Daisy.</i>

1084
00:55:43,906 --> 00:55:45,533
I'd really rather not do this one.

1085
00:55:45,708 --> 00:55:48,700
I really never really got this movie.

1086
00:55:48,878 --> 00:55:50,505
I thought it was a little condescending.

1087
00:55:50,679 --> 00:55:53,648
It's... It's a lovely movie.
Full of generosity and giving.

1088
00:55:53,816 --> 00:55:55,750
- She teaches him to read.
- I know, ma'am.

1089
00:55:55,918 --> 00:55:58,512
How many movies
have that kind of heart?

1090
00:55:58,687 --> 00:56:00,018
Okay.

1091
00:56:00,189 --> 00:56:03,124
Hoke, that's the spot.
Pull over the car.

1092
00:56:03,292 --> 00:56:05,351
- Stop the car right... Hoke!
- This is not the spot.

1093
00:56:05,527 --> 00:56:06,687
Are you...? Are you deaf?

1094
00:56:06,862 --> 00:56:08,295
- I wish I was deaf.
- This is the spot.

1095
00:56:08,464 --> 00:56:10,523
Who is that hussy chasing after us?

1096
00:56:10,699 --> 00:56:14,135
- Be gone, hussy. Hoke...
- You know we're not filming any of it?

1097
00:56:14,303 --> 00:56:16,100
- We're just scouting.
- I know, I'm just practicing.

1098
00:56:16,272 --> 00:56:18,103
I'm staying in character.
Come on, dude.

1099
00:56:18,274 --> 00:56:19,935
Let's keep in character, okay?

1100
00:56:20,109 --> 00:56:22,509
- All right. Mm-hm.
- Come around the side and help me.

1101
00:56:22,678 --> 00:56:24,202
Help me get out of the car.

1102
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:25,642
- Hoke!
- Yes, ma'am.

1103
00:56:25,814 --> 00:56:27,543
- Jerry, have you ever seen the movie?
- Hoke.

1104
00:56:27,716 --> 00:56:28,774
She doesn't act like that.

1105
00:56:28,951 --> 00:56:30,418
Don't you talk to me like that,
young missy.

1106
00:56:30,586 --> 00:56:32,110
- She doesn't act like that.
- You stay over there.

1107
00:56:32,288 --> 00:56:35,121
Hoke, go and find me the grave
that says Werthan on it.

1108
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:36,724
Go like the wind, run.

1109
00:56:36,892 --> 00:56:39,190
Run, Hoke. Please.

1110
00:56:39,361 --> 00:56:43,320
W-E-R-T-H-E-N.

1111
00:56:43,499 --> 00:56:46,024
Hoke, can you hear me?

1112
00:56:46,201 --> 00:56:48,135
Oh, no, Hoke.

1113
00:56:48,304 --> 00:56:49,931
You're illiterate, aren't you?

1114
00:56:50,105 --> 00:56:52,903
- Jerry.
- I'll teach you how to read.

1115
00:56:53,075 --> 00:56:56,977
A W is like a mountain upside down.

1116
00:56:57,146 --> 00:56:58,511
Isn't that clever?

1117
00:56:58,681 --> 00:57:00,911
Now, what happens
if you add an "er<i>"...</i>

1118
00:57:01,083 --> 00:57:02,573
...to the W?
- Mike!

1119
00:57:02,751 --> 00:57:03,911
- What do you think?
- You get...

1120
00:57:04,086 --> 00:57:05,280
- Wer.
- Wer!

1121
00:57:05,454 --> 00:57:07,115
Add a "then, " what do you get?

1122
00:57:07,289 --> 00:57:10,315
- Okay, Jerry, stop.
- Wer...

1123
00:57:10,492 --> 00:57:12,050
- Would you stop?
- No.

1124
00:57:12,227 --> 00:57:14,320
- Wer...
- Werthan, Werthan, Werthan, Werthan!

1125
00:57:14,496 --> 00:57:15,929
Werthan, Werthan, Werthan, Werthan!

1126
00:57:16,098 --> 00:57:17,531
- Mike.
- Knock it off.

1127
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:18,792
Mike, what are you doing?

1128
00:57:18,968 --> 00:57:22,335
- Are we shooting?
- Jerry, come back.

1129
00:57:23,072 --> 00:57:24,835
Jerry.

1130
00:57:29,745 --> 00:57:32,339
- Hey.
- Don't mess around. I'm not in the mood.

1131
00:57:33,248 --> 00:57:35,739
You know, I was in character.

1132
00:57:35,918 --> 00:57:37,886
- I know.
- He didn't have to take it so personally.

1133
00:57:38,053 --> 00:57:42,046
Well, apparently he did. Jerry, like,
you crossed the line a little bit.

1134
00:57:42,257 --> 00:57:44,122
Don't you think
I have my share of humiliation?

1135
00:57:44,293 --> 00:57:46,523
Who keeps on giving
the orders all day? He does.

1136
00:57:46,695 --> 00:57:47,923
- Uh-huh.
- Who keeps taking them?

1137
00:57:48,097 --> 00:57:49,724
- Well, I kind of do all the time.
- No, no, no, no.

1138
00:57:49,898 --> 00:57:51,422
Me. And why should I?

1139
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:52,760
- Things have changed.
- Uh-huh.

1140
00:57:52,935 --> 00:57:54,425
People recognize me in the street.

1141
00:57:54,603 --> 00:57:55,900
- Right, Simon?
- Yeah.

1142
00:57:56,071 --> 00:57:57,129
Yeah. Yup.

1143
00:57:57,306 --> 00:57:59,206
- Yeah.
- They love me. I want my own trailer.

1144
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:00,899
You have a trailer, okay?

1145
00:58:01,076 --> 00:58:02,168
That is where you live.

1146
00:58:02,344 --> 00:58:03,709
- Is that spit on there?
- Yes.

1147
00:58:03,879 --> 00:58:06,040
- Come on.
- Everybody does know you on the street...

1148
00:58:06,215 --> 00:58:09,013
...because all you do is go from your shop
to Mr. Fletcher's and back.

1149
00:58:09,184 --> 00:58:10,378
- It's true.
- No, you don't get it.

1150
00:58:10,552 --> 00:58:13,521
They look at me in a different way,
with love and resp...

1151
00:58:13,689 --> 00:58:15,418
- I'm a star.
- You are a star.

1152
00:58:15,591 --> 00:58:17,422
I want my own trailer
next to my trailer.

1153
00:58:17,593 --> 00:58:20,061
A movie trailer.
That trailer doesn't count.

1154
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:22,863
Get up, Jerry.

1155
00:58:23,032 --> 00:58:25,762
- Everybody's ready.
- It's my time!

1156
00:58:25,934 --> 00:58:28,027
Ali's the man!

1157
00:58:31,073 --> 00:58:36,409
<i>Ali! Ali! Ali!</i>

1158
00:58:36,578 --> 00:58:38,045
It's okay. We're not suggesting...

1159
00:58:38,213 --> 00:58:41,979
As far as Foreman goes,
he was devastating that punching bag...

1160
00:58:42,151 --> 00:58:45,086
...and we writers
were so frightened for Ali...

1161
00:58:45,254 --> 00:58:46,812
...that we were...
- It's incredible.

1162
00:58:46,989 --> 00:58:50,516
The pilots are black, I'm black,
the whole plane is black...

1163
00:58:50,692 --> 00:58:52,751
...and we're not crashing.

1164
00:58:56,665 --> 00:58:59,725
Dave, it's me, HAL.

1165
00:58:59,902 --> 00:59:03,394
I'm afraid I can't open
the pod doors, Dave.

1166
00:59:03,572 --> 00:59:06,735
Why don't you take a jog
around the space capsule?

1167
00:59:07,309 --> 00:59:10,073
Okay, I'm ready. Go.

1168
00:59:45,314 --> 00:59:47,509
Alma! This is ketchup.

1169
00:59:47,683 --> 00:59:50,914
- You said you were gonna use Kool-Aid!
- Sorry.

1170
00:59:51,086 --> 00:59:53,077
God, Alma.

1171
00:59:54,523 --> 00:59:56,286
Oh, where's the driver?

1172
00:59:57,192 --> 00:59:58,216
All right.

1173
00:59:58,393 --> 01:00:00,520
We gotta stop off
and pick up an <i>Enquirer.</i>

1174
01:00:01,897 --> 01:00:03,330
Find out what the aliens are doing.

1175
01:00:03,499 --> 01:00:06,297
We're upside down!
Look, I'm upside down.

1176
01:00:06,468 --> 01:00:10,700
The whole universe is in a marble!

1177
01:00:31,559 --> 01:00:34,323
I'm glad you have come to your senses.

1178
01:00:34,495 --> 01:00:36,395
I have a list of addresses here
for you to visit.

1179
01:00:36,564 --> 01:00:37,929
Hey, hey. No, no, no.

1180
01:00:38,099 --> 01:00:41,500
Tomorrow, I am starting
a progressive transition...

1181
01:00:41,669 --> 01:00:45,105
...to a modern medium: the DVD.

1182
01:00:45,273 --> 01:00:48,299
You see, I've found
these affordable DVD players...

1183
01:00:48,476 --> 01:00:50,967
...that I'm going to recommend
to my customers.

1184
01:00:51,179 --> 01:00:53,147
Within a couple of months,
half of my catalogue...

1185
01:00:53,314 --> 01:00:55,373
...will be digital.
The rest, by the end of the year.

1186
01:00:55,550 --> 01:00:58,713
Which means more titles
in the same space...

1187
01:00:58,886 --> 01:01:00,148
...and more business.

1188
01:01:00,321 --> 01:01:02,346
Listen, if you don't want
the building demolished...

1189
01:01:02,523 --> 01:01:04,923
...then you're going to have to
make these renovations...

1190
01:01:05,093 --> 01:01:07,755
...with one of the city's
licensed contractors.

1191
01:01:07,929 --> 01:01:11,126
Do you have any idea of the kind of costs
we're talking about here?

1192
01:01:11,299 --> 01:01:14,359
Here's an estimate
of the cost to repair the roof.

1193
01:01:14,535 --> 01:01:17,971
And that's the bare minimum
of work needed. I ...

1194
01:01:18,139 --> 01:01:20,699
- I just don't see it happening.
- Okay.

1195
01:01:20,875 --> 01:01:22,467
Okay, what?

1196
01:01:23,878 --> 01:01:24,970
I'll fix the roof.

1197
01:01:26,013 --> 01:01:27,378
Fine.

1198
01:01:27,682 --> 01:01:30,742
You now have six weeks before
Mr. Baker brings the demolition crew...

1199
01:01:30,918 --> 01:01:34,649
...then you're going to have to
relocate yourself at your own expense.

1200
01:01:43,131 --> 01:01:44,689
Next!

1201
01:01:47,568 --> 01:01:48,796
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1202
01:01:48,970 --> 01:01:50,301
Whoa, he cut the line!

1203
01:01:50,471 --> 01:01:52,302
- Hey, gramps.
- Hey.

1204
01:01:52,473 --> 01:01:54,703
Back of the line.
I've been waiting an hour out there.

1205
01:01:54,876 --> 01:01:56,503
- Yeah.
- I came all the way from New York.

1206
01:01:56,677 --> 01:01:57,905
New York, for real?

1207
01:01:58,079 --> 01:01:59,706
- Mike and Jerry are famous there?
- No.

1208
01:01:59,881 --> 01:02:01,405
- Hey, back out.
- My... My shop.

1209
01:02:01,582 --> 01:02:04,915
I'm really sorry, sir, but you're going
to have to go to the back of the line.

1210
01:02:05,086 --> 01:02:07,520
- I can't afford a riot in the shop.
- No, this is my business.

1211
01:02:07,688 --> 01:02:09,781
Can somebody explain to me
what's going on here?

1212
01:02:09,957 --> 01:02:12,323
- Hey, Mike! Where's Mikey? Mike!
- Mr. Fletcher.

1213
01:02:12,493 --> 01:02:14,120
- What's going on, man?
- Oh, hey.

1214
01:02:14,295 --> 01:02:16,126
I can... I can explain everything.

1215
01:02:16,764 --> 01:02:18,925
Something terrible happened
with the tapes.

1216
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:20,965
They all got erased.

1217
01:02:21,135 --> 01:02:23,933
I know you didn't want Jerry
to come into the store...

1218
01:02:24,105 --> 01:02:25,367
...but...
- Jerry?

1219
01:02:25,540 --> 01:02:28,737
All right, this is the last autograph.
My fingers are getting tired. I'm serious.

1220
01:02:28,910 --> 01:02:30,400
- Oh, man.
- I'll see you guys tomorrow.

1221
01:02:30,578 --> 01:02:32,705
Let me take your bag for you,
then I can explain...

1222
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:35,815
Uh-oh, who's back? Mr. Fletchy.
Hey, welcome home, man.

1223
01:02:35,983 --> 01:02:37,473
I got the slogan. Check it out:

1224
01:02:37,652 --> 01:02:40,883
"Be Kind Rewind, Videos  la Carte.

1225
01:02:41,155 --> 01:02:42,520
You name it, we shoot it.

1226
01:02:42,690 --> 01:02:44,521
Be Kind Rewind, Videos  la Carte."

1227
01:02:44,692 --> 01:02:46,523
- Jerry.
- That's great. I think he gets it.

1228
01:02:46,694 --> 01:02:49,527
- Thanks, Jerry.
- It's snappy. Just put a little drums under it.

1229
01:02:49,697 --> 01:02:51,528
- We'll just...
- I didn't mean to scream at you.

1230
01:02:51,699 --> 01:02:53,997
- I didn't know that you were the boss.
- You know what I mean?

1231
01:02:54,168 --> 01:02:56,602
Listen, kids.
I appreciate your creativity...

1232
01:02:56,771 --> 01:02:59,103
...but let's be realistic for a second.

1233
01:02:59,273 --> 01:03:03,107
We will never hit that number,
and the building will be gone.

1234
01:03:03,277 --> 01:03:04,904
Oh, no, Mr. Fletcher. We can do it.

1235
01:03:05,079 --> 01:03:06,910
We've... We've been doing really,
really good.

1236
01:03:07,081 --> 01:03:09,049
You know, we've been working hard.
We grow every day.

1237
01:03:09,217 --> 01:03:12,311
It's far from enough.
We need to adapt to the market.

1238
01:03:12,487 --> 01:03:15,115
So to hell with documentaries...

1239
01:03:15,289 --> 01:03:17,484
...oldies, cult movies.

1240
01:03:17,658 --> 01:03:19,785
We need to simplify.

1241
01:03:19,961 --> 01:03:21,223
Two sections.

1242
01:03:21,395 --> 01:03:24,330
Action-adventures, comedies.
That's it.

1243
01:03:24,499 --> 01:03:26,899
We got to keep the silent movies,
the Fats movies.

1244
01:03:27,068 --> 01:03:29,628
No, no. Quiet. I don't wanna hear
any more about Fats Waller.

1245
01:03:30,204 --> 01:03:33,139
New rules apply
from tomorrow morning.

1246
01:03:35,409 --> 01:03:37,877
Oh, and I forgot.

1247
01:03:40,081 --> 01:03:42,345
DVDs.

1248
01:03:42,517 --> 01:03:43,984
DVD, what?

1249
01:03:44,819 --> 01:03:45,843
No more tapes.

1250
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:49,456
The entire catalogue has to be on DVD
by the end of the year.

1251
01:03:49,624 --> 01:03:50,852
And our films?

1252
01:03:51,025 --> 01:03:52,959
Yours and whatever we rent
from my store.

1253
01:04:03,704 --> 01:04:05,672
I don't know why he's doing this.

1254
01:04:06,374 --> 01:04:09,104
It's like everything
that we've been doing...

1255
01:04:09,277 --> 01:04:12,246
...is just nothing? It's... Just like...

1256
01:04:12,747 --> 01:04:14,715
- We can't keep doing this.
- No way.

1257
01:04:14,882 --> 01:04:18,909
We are doing better business
than this store has ever done.

1258
01:04:19,086 --> 01:04:20,713
We're... We're celebrities now.

1259
01:04:20,888 --> 01:04:23,152
We're on the power list.
He has to listen to us.

1260
01:04:23,324 --> 01:04:26,088
No. No, he don't.
I should've known.

1261
01:04:26,260 --> 01:04:29,855
It's my fault. I should've known.
He don't like... He don't like remakes.

1262
01:04:30,765 --> 01:04:31,925
It's worthless to him.

1263
01:04:32,099 --> 01:04:35,193
It's like I'm nothing to him.
I just... I just work here.

1264
01:04:40,174 --> 01:04:42,199
Filthy little punk.

1265
01:04:47,081 --> 01:04:50,175
No way this punk kid
gonna put his filth on my piano.

1266
01:04:57,258 --> 01:05:00,250
<i>No, I erased all the tapes.</i>

1267
01:05:00,861 --> 01:05:02,226
I'm the little punk.

1268
01:05:03,598 --> 01:05:06,897
Why is it always about you guys?

1269
01:05:07,068 --> 01:05:08,501
What about me?

1270
01:05:08,669 --> 01:05:10,500
What about Alma?

1271
01:05:11,472 --> 01:05:14,532
I wanna be a filthy punk too,
you know?

1272
01:05:15,276 --> 01:05:19,076
These are not just simple remakes.

1273
01:05:19,246 --> 01:05:21,441
They are way more creative.

1274
01:05:21,616 --> 01:05:24,084
Of course, if the business
maintains its current progress...

1275
01:05:24,251 --> 01:05:26,276
...we won't hit the objective.

1276
01:05:26,454 --> 01:05:28,854
But if we shorten
the length of the films...

1277
01:05:29,023 --> 01:05:30,684
...we can shoot more of them.

1278
01:05:30,858 --> 01:05:34,817
And we will incrementally increase
the increase of the income.

1279
01:05:34,996 --> 01:05:37,521
- Can you repeat the last...?
- No, Alma.

1280
01:05:37,698 --> 01:05:41,134
- People will feel swindled.
- Not if we include them in the films.

1281
01:05:41,302 --> 01:05:42,701
We'll give them parts to play.

1282
01:05:42,870 --> 01:05:45,896
This way: A, with their help,
we can make more movies...

1283
01:05:46,073 --> 01:05:48,701
... B, the films can be shorter
and they won't feel swindled.

1284
01:05:48,876 --> 01:05:52,039
They're not gonna feel cheated,
they won't feel swindled...

1285
01:05:52,213 --> 01:05:54,306
...and they'll see their selves as a part...
- Yes.

1286
01:05:54,482 --> 01:05:55,847
...of the neighborhood.
- They'll become the stockholders...

1287
01:05:56,017 --> 01:05:57,314
...of their own happiness.

1288
01:05:57,485 --> 01:06:00,079
You guys, this is something
we can build on.

1289
01:06:00,254 --> 01:06:03,155
If we do more movies
in a shorter time, we can...

1290
01:06:03,324 --> 01:06:05,155
- We can rent more movies.
- That's what I'm saying.

1291
01:06:05,359 --> 01:06:07,919
- Wait, that's what I just said.
- I thought it before you said it.

1292
01:06:08,095 --> 01:06:09,722
- Doesn't matter who said it first.
- No... Jerry.

1293
01:06:09,897 --> 01:06:11,489
We're all saying...
We're all on the same page.

1294
01:06:11,666 --> 01:06:14,294
- I agree, I agree.
- I wanna be a part of this team officially.

1295
01:06:14,468 --> 01:06:16,129
It's like... What do you call that,
when snow falls...?

1296
01:06:16,303 --> 01:06:18,703
- Avalanche.
- No, when... Snowballing.

1297
01:06:18,873 --> 01:06:21,671
- Snowballing. Getting bigger and bigger.
- That's an avalanche.

1298
01:06:21,842 --> 01:06:24,902
And it incrementally increases
the snowball size.

1299
01:06:25,079 --> 01:06:28,173
- Come on. Right here. I can feel this.
- We need to do this.

1300
01:06:28,349 --> 01:06:30,442
- Go.
- Explode! Big success.

1301
01:06:34,655 --> 01:06:39,490
<i>Do you really wanna buy these expensive</i>
<i>and overly complicated DVD players?</i>

1302
01:06:39,794 --> 01:06:41,887
<i>No. No way.</i>

1303
01:06:42,063 --> 01:06:45,624
<i>So for only $ 20,</i>
<i>you can purchase this digital unit...</i>

1304
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:48,769
<i>... you can simply tape or glue</i>
<i>into your VCR...</i>

1305
01:06:49,270 --> 01:06:52,899
<i>... and then it upgrades</i>
<i>into our Be Kind Rewind DVD player.</i>

1306
01:06:53,074 --> 01:06:56,043
<i>And only then is when</i>
<i>you can play our Be Kind Rewind...</i>

1307
01:06:56,210 --> 01:06:58,906
<i>- That is good.</i>
<i>...DVDs.</i>

1308
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:01,241
<i>Vacation</i> with Chevy Chase.
Comedy, please.

1309
01:07:01,415 --> 01:07:02,905
- That's not Sweded yet. Sorry.
- Comedy.

1310
01:07:03,084 --> 01:07:05,712
- Comedy.
<i>- The Jerk</i>, action.

1311
01:07:05,886 --> 01:07:08,320
Wrong genre. That is a comedy.

1312
01:07:08,489 --> 01:07:10,423
I must exclude you for the day.

1313
01:07:10,591 --> 01:07:12,684
You can come back tomorrow.
That's the new system.

1314
01:07:12,860 --> 01:07:14,122
You have to say the right thing.

1315
01:07:14,295 --> 01:07:15,990
Man, the new system sucks, man.

1316
01:07:16,163 --> 01:07:17,926
I'm sick and tired of all these rules.

1317
01:07:18,099 --> 01:07:20,897
- Hey, <i>Lord of the Rings</i> is not a comedy.
- We didn't insult your new rules.

1318
01:07:21,068 --> 01:07:23,536
Now, listen. I want <i>The Jerk...</i>

1319
01:07:23,871 --> 01:07:26,339
...Sweden by tomorrow.
- Sweded, Sweded.

1320
01:07:26,507 --> 01:07:28,134
- Sweded.
- Sweded by tomorrow...

1321
01:07:28,309 --> 01:07:30,903
...or this little thing that's in your...

1322
01:07:31,078 --> 01:07:33,012
Let me see, let me see.

1323
01:07:33,481 --> 01:07:36,541
I'd be lying if I said
I was not waiting for this opportunity...

1324
01:07:36,717 --> 01:07:37,911
...to teach you a lesson.

1325
01:07:38,085 --> 01:07:40,519
Mr. Fletcher,
this is really hurting my arm, okay?

1326
01:07:40,688 --> 01:07:42,656
Listen, I apologize, okay?

1327
01:07:42,823 --> 01:07:45,724
- Good, good.
- I... I will follow the new rules.

1328
01:07:45,893 --> 01:07:47,326
Good. But more importantly...

1329
01:07:47,495 --> 01:07:49,895
...you should never
threaten your auntie again.

1330
01:07:50,064 --> 01:07:52,532
She works very hard
to keep a roof over your head.

1331
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:53,997
And these guys...

1332
01:07:54,168 --> 01:07:56,659
...are working very hard to save ours.

1333
01:07:56,837 --> 01:07:58,236
- You get my drift?
- Yeah, I got it.

1334
01:07:58,706 --> 01:08:00,697
Thank you for the lesson.

1335
01:08:02,643 --> 01:08:05,771
Sounds like Fats Waller's
back in the house.

1336
01:08:05,946 --> 01:08:07,208
It's... It's his house.

1337
01:08:09,116 --> 01:08:12,608
<i>Now, my boy, do you know where</i>
<i>our Fats...</i>

1338
01:08:12,787 --> 01:08:14,846
<i>... did record most of his tunes</i>
<i>and why?</i>

1339
01:08:15,022 --> 01:08:16,717
<i>- I know that one.</i>
<i>- I'm not sure.</i>

1340
01:08:16,891 --> 01:08:18,290
<i>- I know the answer.</i>
<i>- Mike?</i>

1341
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:20,322
<i>At RC A Studios in Camden.</i>

1342
01:08:20,494 --> 01:08:23,952
<i>They liked to drive there on the train on the</i>
<i>way to the studio so they can get drunk.</i>

1343
01:08:24,131 --> 01:08:25,758
<i>Sometimes they didn 't</i>
<i>even get to the studio...</i>

1344
01:08:25,933 --> 01:08:28,163
<i>... because they would get in a fight</i>
<i>or they'd get arrested.</i>

1345
01:08:28,335 --> 01:08:31,304
<i>Mr. Fletcher, I don 't really see</i>
<i>the connection with my lesson.</i>

1346
01:08:31,472 --> 01:08:34,441
There is none.
We changed the subject.

1347
01:08:37,978 --> 01:08:39,275
Set up the cameras over there.

1348
01:08:39,446 --> 01:08:41,880
We wanna get in the red car
to do a little make-out session.

1349
01:08:45,753 --> 01:08:48,551
We're walking in the rain.
It's kind of warm and fu<i>zz</i>y, and I kiss you.

1350
01:08:50,658 --> 01:08:51,682
And we're like young lovers.

1351
01:08:53,127 --> 01:08:54,560
Wow, these guys are good.

1352
01:08:56,263 --> 01:08:57,321
They can shoot any style.

1353
01:08:57,498 --> 01:08:59,125
We cast Jack and his friends.

1354
01:09:00,568 --> 01:09:01,660
- Whatever, man.
- You hear what he's saying, man?

1355
01:09:01,836 --> 01:09:03,531
Yo, see. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1356
01:09:03,704 --> 01:09:05,695
Come on.
You want some of this, buddy?

1357
01:09:05,873 --> 01:09:07,773
I'm shooting him.

1358
01:09:07,942 --> 01:09:10,376
Oh, no. Derek!

1359
01:09:10,911 --> 01:09:11,935
Why?

1360
01:09:12,112 --> 01:09:14,376
Look at the pool of blood around him.

1361
01:09:14,548 --> 01:09:15,708
He's with Jesus.

1362
01:09:15,883 --> 01:09:18,909
What's happening to our 'hood?
It's no good.

1363
01:09:19,086 --> 01:09:22,544
<i>It's senseless, the violence.</i>

1364
01:09:35,803 --> 01:09:38,499
Kids, I have to admit...

1365
01:09:40,908 --> 01:09:42,034
... I was wrong.

1366
01:09:42,209 --> 01:09:45,007
To movies with heart.

1367
01:09:45,512 --> 01:09:47,707
- And soul.
<i>- I remember the sandwiches too.</i>

1368
01:09:47,882 --> 01:09:49,850
<i>- We had pig ears.</i>
- Just look at Mr. Fletcher there.

1369
01:09:51,218 --> 01:09:52,947
<i>- Pig ears and white bread.</i>
- I smell elephant.

1370
01:09:54,755 --> 01:09:55,779
You're the number one hunter
in the world.

1371
01:09:55,956 --> 01:09:57,685
When you see that elephant,
you know that you have to kill it.

1372
01:09:59,059 --> 01:10:00,424
- That's great. We did it.
- And cut.

1373
01:10:00,594 --> 01:10:01,618
Now we're like animals.

1374
01:10:03,197 --> 01:10:05,062
I love you, I love you.
I'm having sex with you.

1375
01:10:10,004 --> 01:10:12,700
We're nearly there. One more week.

1376
01:10:12,873 --> 01:10:15,671
"Jerry and Alma in<i>..."</i>
"Jerry and Alma in<i>..."</i>

1377
01:10:16,710 --> 01:10:21,204
Jerry and Alma, Jerry and Alma,
Jerry and Alma.

1378
01:10:22,316 --> 01:10:24,284
Are you jealous or something?

1379
01:10:24,451 --> 01:10:26,510
No. No, I'm not.

1380
01:10:26,687 --> 01:10:29,281
Forget about what I even said.
Don't... I'm sorry.

1381
01:10:29,456 --> 01:10:31,424
Well... Well, really. I mean...

1382
01:10:31,592 --> 01:10:35,050
... how come he's always
the one with you in the movies?

1383
01:10:35,229 --> 01:10:36,696
It's always him.

1384
01:10:36,864 --> 01:10:40,732
Well, Jerry said
that you complained about my...

1385
01:10:40,901 --> 01:10:41,993
That is a dirty lie.

1386
01:10:42,169 --> 01:10:46,003
I never said a word about your mustache.
I didn't say anything about it.

1387
01:10:47,474 --> 01:10:50,409
I never said my mustache.

1388
01:10:50,844 --> 01:10:52,436
Okay, so Jerry was telling the truth.

1389
01:10:52,613 --> 01:10:54,604
And that's why you never wanted
to kiss me or anything.

1390
01:10:54,782 --> 01:10:56,841
No, no. I never complained about that.

1391
01:10:57,017 --> 01:10:58,917
Mike, I never said the word,
and you did.

1392
01:10:59,086 --> 01:11:00,246
So how would you know, huh?

1393
01:11:00,421 --> 01:11:02,912
Because he complains about it
all the time, to tell you the truth.

1394
01:11:03,090 --> 01:11:04,182
What's the difference?

1395
01:11:04,358 --> 01:11:06,622
- You think I have one, right?
- No. Really, to be perfectly honest...

1396
01:11:06,794 --> 01:11:08,887
... I don't even think you have one.
- I wish I was dead right now.

1397
01:11:09,063 --> 01:11:11,122
Just really quick. Let me see.

1398
01:11:13,901 --> 01:11:16,301
You know what? I don't see anything.

1399
01:11:17,504 --> 01:11:19,699
- I don't see anything.
- You don't see it?

1400
01:11:19,873 --> 01:11:21,363
No.

1401
01:11:22,643 --> 01:11:23,667
Thanks.

1402
01:11:23,844 --> 01:11:25,778
Maybe I should give you a blind test.

1403
01:11:25,946 --> 01:11:27,504
Yeah, I think we need a blind test.

1404
01:11:32,286 --> 01:11:33,810
So?

1405
01:11:34,822 --> 01:11:37,620
Hey! You're trying to kiss me.

1406
01:11:37,791 --> 01:11:39,520
- Why not?
<i>- "</i>Why not"?

1407
01:11:39,693 --> 01:11:41,718
- Are you in love with me?
- Huh?

1408
01:11:41,895 --> 01:11:43,487
Mm-hm.

1409
01:11:43,664 --> 01:11:44,790
Well, how do I know that?

1410
01:11:44,965 --> 01:11:46,557
You know you're in love
with a person...

1411
01:11:46,734 --> 01:11:49,726
...when you talk to them for a minimum
of 20 minutes a day in your head.

1412
01:11:49,903 --> 01:11:52,895
What if I talk to a guy in my head
for 20 minutes? What would that mean?

1413
01:11:53,073 --> 01:11:54,665
You're in love with Jerry.

1414
01:11:54,842 --> 01:11:57,140
- Huh? Ew, no. We're closed.
- Yes, you are in love with Jerry.

1415
01:11:57,311 --> 01:11:59,040
- No, I'm not.
- Hey, Mike, you hear the door?

1416
01:11:59,213 --> 01:12:01,044
Not at all. No, that's not... It c...

1417
01:12:01,215 --> 01:12:02,705
Listen, it could be anybody.

1418
01:12:02,883 --> 01:12:05,545
- Mr. T, Fats.
- You are in love with him.

1419
01:12:05,719 --> 01:12:07,619
- I know it.
- Mr. Elroy Fletcher.

1420
01:12:07,788 --> 01:12:09,619
Yes.

1421
01:12:09,790 --> 01:12:10,916
To whom it may concern...

1422
01:12:11,091 --> 01:12:14,891
...copyright infringement is punishable
by state and federal law.

1423
01:12:15,062 --> 01:12:17,826
Now, I hold in my hand a restraining order
from Trenton...

1424
01:12:17,998 --> 01:12:22,901
...and, actually, a warrant of seizure
from Washington D.C.

1425
01:12:23,070 --> 01:12:24,662
- So you, the defendant...
- What's up?

1426
01:12:24,838 --> 01:12:27,500
... have declined to attend
the judgment proceedings...

1427
01:12:27,674 --> 01:12:30,939
...so the studios are coordinating
to assess...

1428
01:12:31,111 --> 01:12:33,909
...the damages from...
How many titles is it?

1429
01:12:34,081 --> 01:12:35,981
- Approximately 200.
- Okay. So...

1430
01:12:36,150 --> 01:12:37,708
Oh, what do we have here?

1431
01:12:37,885 --> 01:12:39,716
- A record of rental.
- Oh.

1432
01:12:39,887 --> 01:12:42,651
- What?
- Two hundred titles times...

1433
01:12:42,823 --> 01:12:43,983
... how many average viewings?

1434
01:12:44,158 --> 01:12:45,682
Sixty-three times per tape.

1435
01:12:45,859 --> 01:12:49,727
Times 250,000 maximum in damages...

1436
01:12:49,897 --> 01:12:54,163
...and/or up to five years in prison...

1437
01:12:54,334 --> 01:12:57,098
...per offense.
- Which adds up to...

1438
01:12:57,271 --> 01:13:00,900
...3. 15 billion dollars in fines...

1439
01:13:01,075 --> 01:13:02,736
...which would need to be paid back
to the studios...

1440
01:13:02,910 --> 01:13:05,538
- I'll write you a check.
...and/or...

1441
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:09,508
...63,000 years in prison.

1442
01:13:09,683 --> 01:13:14,120
Which, of course, would have to be served
before you could reopen the store.

1443
01:13:14,288 --> 01:13:16,756
But we made the movies ourselves.

1444
01:13:16,924 --> 01:13:18,323
- They're our...
- And people like them.

1445
01:13:18,492 --> 01:13:21,518
You're... You're right. But technically,
you're wrong. You see, these tapes...

1446
01:13:21,695 --> 01:13:22,923
...belong to the studios.

1447
01:13:23,097 --> 01:13:26,260
Look, it's written.
FBI warning, right there.

1448
01:13:26,433 --> 01:13:27,764
It's at the beginning of the tape
as well.

1449
01:13:27,935 --> 01:13:31,928
- But we erased that, so...
- I think it's...

1450
01:13:32,106 --> 01:13:34,301
People come here because
they want to see these movies.

1451
01:13:34,475 --> 01:13:38,104
That's why they come here. They're not
interested in those formulaic big movies.

1452
01:13:38,278 --> 01:13:40,007
They're not interested in them.
They don't wanna see them.

1453
01:13:40,180 --> 01:13:41,477
Sir. Sir.
Taste has nothing to do with this.

1454
01:13:41,648 --> 01:13:43,206
Don't listen to them.
Mr. Fletcher, you can kick them out.

1455
01:13:43,383 --> 01:13:44,941
- The entire film industry is crumbling...
- They're trespassing.

1456
01:13:45,119 --> 01:13:46,245
...because of pirates and bootleggers.

1457
01:13:46,420 --> 01:13:48,888
And we intend to stop it.
Right now, right here.

1458
01:13:49,056 --> 01:13:52,082
We're not selling boots,
and we're not... We're not pirates.

1459
01:13:52,259 --> 01:13:54,625
- And we don't have viruses.
- I'm sorry, Mr...

1460
01:13:54,795 --> 01:13:56,353
- Fletcher.
- Mr. Fletcher.

1461
01:13:56,530 --> 01:13:58,327
I mean, look.
I have a family too, okay?

1462
01:13:58,499 --> 01:14:01,093
I didn't say I do. I mean,
what has this got to do about a family?

1463
01:14:01,268 --> 01:14:04,362
Nevertheless,
this writ gives us permission...

1464
01:14:04,538 --> 01:14:08,099
...to destroy all your black-market tapes
by the end of the day...

1465
01:14:08,275 --> 01:14:11,369
...and all of these assets
in the store...

1466
01:14:11,545 --> 01:14:14,514
...are hereby seized
to pay these penalties to the studios.

1467
01:14:14,681 --> 01:14:16,740
No, no, no. These are... No, no, no.
Not the...

1468
01:14:16,917 --> 01:14:18,350
We just want to get in and out...

1469
01:14:18,519 --> 01:14:20,919
...as painlessly as possible.
- Those are Sweded!

1470
01:14:21,088 --> 01:14:22,248
Hey, let him go.

1471
01:14:28,328 --> 01:14:29,727
Mr. Fletcher?

1472
01:14:29,897 --> 01:14:31,330
Mr. Fletcher.

1473
01:14:31,498 --> 01:14:33,295
I could save the building.
I got a plan B.

1474
01:14:33,467 --> 01:14:37,096
This is a application to make it
a historical landmark.

1475
01:14:37,271 --> 01:14:39,671
I can't believe
that I didn't remember it before.

1476
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:42,206
It's gonna be easy,
because Fats was born here.

1477
01:14:42,776 --> 01:14:45,643
No, Mike, it's not so simple.

1478
01:14:45,812 --> 01:14:47,871
Why not?
You can go get his birth certificate.

1479
01:14:48,048 --> 01:14:50,676
The address has got to be on the birth
certificate. Go check the public records.

1480
01:14:50,851 --> 01:14:53,319
No, Mike,
we can't provide any documents...

1481
01:14:53,487 --> 01:14:56,320
...to prove that Fats lived here.

1482
01:14:56,490 --> 01:14:58,458
You wanna know why?

1483
01:14:59,159 --> 01:15:00,626
Huh? You wanna know why?

1484
01:15:02,329 --> 01:15:03,921
- Because...
- No, no.

1485
01:15:04,097 --> 01:15:05,359
- No, no, listen.
- I don't wanna...

1486
01:15:05,532 --> 01:15:07,363
Now you don't want
to finish my sentences, huh?

1487
01:15:07,534 --> 01:15:08,967
Boy, look here. I'll finish it.

1488
01:15:09,136 --> 01:15:12,697
We can't prove
Fats Waller lived here...

1489
01:15:12,873 --> 01:15:15,068
...because he never did.

1490
01:15:27,888 --> 01:15:29,879
I think you should come one more time.

1491
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:35,651
Just tell me why.

1492
01:15:39,266 --> 01:15:42,133
Well, they started as bedtime stories.

1493
01:15:42,302 --> 01:15:44,395
I was trying to make this place
bearable for you.

1494
01:15:46,073 --> 01:15:49,099
And then I could never bring myself
to tell you the truth.

1495
01:15:49,276 --> 01:15:51,710
Well, why Fats Waller?

1496
01:15:51,878 --> 01:15:53,243
You could have picked anybody.

1497
01:15:54,481 --> 01:15:57,780
I mean, Duke Ellington
or Louis Armstrong or...

1498
01:15:57,951 --> 01:15:59,714
Fats was a happy man.

1499
01:15:59,886 --> 01:16:02,548
And I thought
it would make you happy.

1500
01:16:02,990 --> 01:16:05,823
And it's true, I lied.

1501
01:16:06,059 --> 01:16:09,187
Now I'm going to hell, upstairs.

1502
01:16:17,437 --> 01:16:20,429
Here we are, we're the villains, right?

1503
01:16:54,341 --> 01:16:56,070
Hold that.

1504
01:17:11,524 --> 01:17:13,458
Mike!

1505
01:17:13,627 --> 01:17:15,857
We want more movies.

1506
01:17:16,029 --> 01:17:17,860
We want more movies!

1507
01:17:18,031 --> 01:17:19,862
Come on, baby.

1508
01:17:20,033 --> 01:17:22,934
Mike, wake up, baby.
We need to make more movies.

1509
01:17:23,103 --> 01:17:25,367
- What are you doing?
- Look at all these people here.

1510
01:17:25,538 --> 01:17:27,335
- We want more movies, man.
- Yeah.

1511
01:17:27,507 --> 01:17:31,170
We cannot do these movies anymore.
It's illegal.

1512
01:17:31,344 --> 01:17:32,606
You can make your own.

1513
01:17:32,779 --> 01:17:36,545
- I don't have ideas for movies, Jerry.
- Oh, bullpucky.

1514
01:17:36,716 --> 01:17:39,844
You have got tons of ideas.
Brilliant ideas.

1515
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:42,079
I hear them,
you mumble them in your sleep.

1516
01:17:42,255 --> 01:17:45,691
Mike, we can make
any movie we want.

1517
01:17:45,859 --> 01:17:49,022
We don't have to make one... They can't
sue us if we're making new ones.

1518
01:17:49,562 --> 01:17:53,191
Make whatever you want.
Make <i>Rush Hour 6,</i> whatever.

1519
01:17:53,366 --> 01:17:54,833
You know what I mean?

1520
01:17:55,001 --> 01:17:58,198
Let's make <i>Scary Town 5000.</i>

1521
01:17:58,371 --> 01:18:00,134
We make it up, baby.

1522
01:18:00,307 --> 01:18:02,104
- You're the best director I know.
- Wait a minute.

1523
01:18:02,275 --> 01:18:03,299
- Wait a minute.
- And I'm the best actor...

1524
01:18:03,476 --> 01:18:05,068
...that I know.
- I have an idea.

1525
01:18:05,245 --> 01:18:08,009
And together we're a team
that can't be stopped!

1526
01:18:08,181 --> 01:18:11,548
Mike. Where did you go? Come back.

1527
01:18:11,718 --> 01:18:12,776
Come on, Mike.

1528
01:18:12,952 --> 01:18:14,920
I want Mr. Fletcher to see.

1529
01:18:15,088 --> 01:18:17,420
Mr. Fletcher.

1530
01:18:18,458 --> 01:18:20,858
Mr. Fletcher!

1531
01:18:21,027 --> 01:18:22,426
What do you need me for?

1532
01:18:23,029 --> 01:18:24,496
To hell with them, Mr. Fletcher.

1533
01:18:24,664 --> 01:18:27,758
We don't have to move to the projects
if we don't want, we can stay right here.

1534
01:18:27,934 --> 01:18:30,198
How do we do that, exactly?

1535
01:18:30,370 --> 01:18:32,235
We're gonna make a movie, all of us.

1536
01:18:32,405 --> 01:18:34,236
All of these people
came out to support us.

1537
01:18:34,407 --> 01:18:35,965
We're gonna make a movie together.

1538
01:18:36,142 --> 01:18:37,404
Like the city that saves itself?

1539
01:18:37,577 --> 01:18:40,011
No, no. Check it, check it.

1540
01:18:40,180 --> 01:18:43,547
We're gonna do a movie
about Fats Waller's life.

1541
01:18:43,717 --> 01:18:45,776
Your hero, my hero.

1542
01:18:45,952 --> 01:18:49,718
And we don't need permission
to make movies on our own.

1543
01:18:49,889 --> 01:18:51,379
This is for us to watch.

1544
01:18:51,558 --> 01:18:54,425
- The whole town is participating.
- It'll be ours.

1545
01:18:54,594 --> 01:18:57,586
The movie could be called
<i>Fats Was Born in Passaic.</i>

1546
01:18:57,764 --> 01:19:00,528
- Yeah!
- Everybody knows I was lying.

1547
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:03,931
- You gonna humiliate me again?
- No. No, Mr. Fletcher.

1548
01:19:04,104 --> 01:19:06,265
No, he's trying to prove you were right.

1549
01:19:06,439 --> 01:19:10,273
Our past belongs to us,
we can change it if we want.

1550
01:19:10,443 --> 01:19:13,435
Sure. My mom...

1551
01:19:13,613 --> 01:19:17,777
My mom saw Fats Waller playing...

1552
01:19:17,951 --> 01:19:21,216
Playing the piano right here
in the Passaic Theater.

1553
01:19:21,388 --> 01:19:24,846
Sure. Anybody wanna
say anything about that?

1554
01:19:25,024 --> 01:19:26,184
Yes, me.

1555
01:19:26,359 --> 01:19:30,819
My grandfather used to watch him
play Bach every night in the church.

1556
01:19:30,997 --> 01:19:34,057
- There you go.
- My great-uncle saved his life.

1557
01:19:34,234 --> 01:19:38,500
He took the train to Camden
to record in the RCA studios.

1558
01:19:38,671 --> 01:19:41,105
He really did take the train to Camden.

1559
01:19:41,274 --> 01:19:42,536
That's right!

1560
01:19:42,709 --> 01:19:44,939
Mike. We only have a week
before the demolition.

1561
01:19:45,111 --> 01:19:46,476
It's not a problem. That's okay.

1562
01:19:46,646 --> 01:19:48,637
We'll shoot the whole thing in a week.

1563
01:19:48,815 --> 01:19:50,806
And we could take donations
to see the movie...

1564
01:19:50,984 --> 01:19:52,645
...and use the money
to save the building.

1565
01:19:52,819 --> 01:19:55,720
- I'll play Fats.
- No, no. You're not. I'm gonna play Fats.

1566
01:19:55,889 --> 01:19:56,947
We'll see who plays Fats.

1567
01:19:57,123 --> 01:19:59,057
- You're not gonna play Fats.
- We'll see. There'll be an audition process.

1568
01:19:59,225 --> 01:20:00,624
No, there's not.
You're not gonna play Fats.

1569
01:20:00,794 --> 01:20:02,352
- May the best man play Fats.
- Okay.

1570
01:20:02,529 --> 01:20:03,791
Anyway, we should do it.

1571
01:20:05,398 --> 01:20:06,865
Good idea.

1572
01:20:15,575 --> 01:20:18,271
- Test, test, test.
- It looks like it's working.

1573
01:20:18,445 --> 01:20:19,639
- I can't tell if it's working.
- I think it's working...

1574
01:20:19,813 --> 01:20:20,871
...because this is pressed down.
- All right.

1575
01:20:21,047 --> 01:20:22,912
<i>- Test. I can 't tell.</i>
<i>- It's working.</i>

1576
01:20:23,082 --> 01:20:24,777
- Yeah, that's... Okay.
- It's working.

1577
01:20:24,951 --> 01:20:28,682
But it all started right here
at 261 Main Street.

1578
01:20:28,855 --> 01:20:33,053
Miss Falewicz, can you tell us
some of the true history of Fats Waller?

1579
01:20:33,226 --> 01:20:36,491
Fats was born
in Mr. Fletcher's video store.

1580
01:20:36,663 --> 01:20:39,131
He was the youngest
of seven children...

1581
01:20:39,299 --> 01:20:43,736
...and all of them died
before they even got to be 5.

1582
01:20:43,903 --> 01:20:45,200
- Gangsters killed them all.
- Yep.

1583
01:20:45,371 --> 01:20:48,863
- They came low-riding.
- Yup, they just shot them. They were like:

1584
01:20:49,042 --> 01:20:50,475
- They were like ninjas.
- Yeah.

1585
01:20:50,643 --> 01:20:52,235
But, boys, there's nothing fun about it.

1586
01:20:52,412 --> 01:20:54,312
- They were awful.
- It was kind of fun, though...

1587
01:20:54,481 --> 01:20:55,505
...if you think about it.

1588
01:20:55,682 --> 01:20:58,879
What is the first instrument
that Fats learned to play?

1589
01:20:59,752 --> 01:21:03,483
- From what I recall it was the piano.
- I think it was the harmonium, actually.

1590
01:21:03,656 --> 01:21:05,886
Yes, she's correct.

1591
01:21:06,059 --> 01:21:11,053
And he moved on to play one of the
biggest instruments in the music business.

1592
01:21:11,231 --> 01:21:12,255
And that's the organ.

1593
01:21:12,432 --> 01:21:16,198
He would spend nights here
playing, like, Bach.

1594
01:21:16,369 --> 01:21:19,031
You know, here at the great organ here.
Right here.

1595
01:21:20,907 --> 01:21:24,172
You guys, listen. There's a lot of
different ways we can start the movie...

1596
01:21:24,344 --> 01:21:28,280
...but I'm just putting my vote in,
we start at Fats' birth.

1597
01:21:28,448 --> 01:21:29,540
Boring.

1598
01:21:30,149 --> 01:21:32,913
Hey, man. I think we should have the
gangsters. You know what I'm saying?

1599
01:21:33,086 --> 01:21:36,078
- With the:
- I like that.

1600
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:39,225
Everybody, listen, listen.
Start with the death.

1601
01:21:39,392 --> 01:21:41,724
- But that's backwards.
- No, it's not backwards at all.

1602
01:21:41,895 --> 01:21:44,159
That is like <i>Citizen Kane.</i>
You are an original.

1603
01:21:44,330 --> 01:21:45,661
If you're going backwards...

1604
01:21:45,832 --> 01:21:49,427
...then do the people talk, like,
backwards in the scene?

1605
01:22:04,450 --> 01:22:10,047
<i>Ain't misbehavin'</i>
<i>Saving all my lovin' for you</i>

1606
01:22:13,626 --> 01:22:15,890
You know... I'm fat. Fats is fat.

1607
01:22:16,062 --> 01:22:18,622
That's his name.
So I thought I could...

1608
01:22:18,798 --> 01:22:23,633
You thought wrong.
But let's have a conversation about this.

1609
01:22:23,803 --> 01:22:25,293
Just a brief conversation.

1610
01:22:25,471 --> 01:22:28,133
He's not even fat.
I don't even think he looks like him at all.

1611
01:22:28,308 --> 01:22:30,071
- Be quiet.
- Go outside.

1612
01:22:30,810 --> 01:22:33,870
Somebody's about to get knocked out.

1613
01:22:35,248 --> 01:22:37,113
Kansas City, the train station,
the death scene.

1614
01:22:37,283 --> 01:22:39,410
Mr. Jack, Mr. Jack. It's going.

1615
01:22:39,586 --> 01:22:42,020
It's good. It's good.
Thank you, Andrea.

1616
01:22:42,188 --> 01:22:44,349
- What the hell is a "harmoninium" anyway?
- Harmonium.

1617
01:22:44,524 --> 01:22:47,049
Okay, what is it, just a weird thing
that makes harmonies?

1618
01:22:47,226 --> 01:22:48,284
- It's fine.
- I give up.

1619
01:22:48,461 --> 01:22:49,826
You got the keyboard here already.

1620
01:22:49,996 --> 01:22:51,486
Fats liked to tickle the piano, right?

1621
01:22:51,664 --> 01:22:53,632
So my hand touches
the black keys, the white keys.

1622
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:55,131
- It's wrong.
- And then we tickle.

1623
01:22:55,301 --> 01:22:57,428
- Tickle, tickle, tickle.
- Fats played a piano, not a finger machine.

1624
01:22:57,604 --> 01:22:59,595
- You gotta put something there with keys.
- It's funny.

1625
01:22:59,772 --> 01:23:02,536
It's cheating. You're just lazy.
You gotta put something in there.

1626
01:23:02,709 --> 01:23:04,973
Doesn't look very much like the '20s.

1627
01:23:05,144 --> 01:23:06,634
- It's clearly a bathtub.
- This goes?

1628
01:23:06,813 --> 01:23:09,213
No, forget it. You know what?
Forget it. I got a better idea.

1629
01:23:09,382 --> 01:23:11,782
We gotta have a bunch of them anyway.
You know what I'm thinking?

1630
01:23:11,951 --> 01:23:14,044
- What?
- Get me some cardboard.

1631
01:23:17,590 --> 01:23:20,058
Hey, look, this is how
you make it look old.

1632
01:23:20,226 --> 01:23:22,956
The fan give the impression
that it's a old film.

1633
01:23:23,129 --> 01:23:24,994
And the string is for the scratches.
See?

1634
01:23:25,164 --> 01:23:26,631
This is for the voice-over.

1635
01:23:26,799 --> 01:23:29,324
<i>Miss Falewicz, can you tell us</i>
<i>some of the true history...?</i>

01:24:08,508 --> 01:24:10,738
<i>... because his father</i>
<i>was a street minister.</i>

1649
01:24:10,910 --> 01:24:15,142
Even if I ascended to heaven,
thou art there.

1650
01:24:15,314 --> 01:24:17,179
Clap your hands.

1651
01:24:17,350 --> 01:24:19,045
- Does it look good or what?
- Yeah.

1652
01:24:19,218 --> 01:24:20,879
Continue to jiggle.

1653
01:24:21,054 --> 01:24:22,954
- Tickle the keys, Mike.
- I'm doing it.

1654
01:24:23,122 --> 01:24:24,714
I can clearly see
that you're not doing it.

1655
01:24:24,891 --> 01:24:26,882
- I barely can see...
- I'm clearly doing it.

1656
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:30,087
Yeah. Okay.

1657
01:24:31,297 --> 01:24:33,788
Wilson, how do you drive a train?

1658
01:24:33,966 --> 01:24:35,558
Push up the switches
on the generator.

1659
01:24:35,735 --> 01:24:37,100
Okay. I got it.

1660
01:24:39,739 --> 01:24:41,104
Yeah!

1661
01:24:50,083 --> 01:24:51,550
Alma, you in position?

1662
01:24:51,718 --> 01:24:53,845
We're just crossing the river now.
You see us?

1663
01:24:54,020 --> 01:24:56,784
<i>Yeah, I can see you.</i>
<i>I'm starting the camera.</i>

1664
01:24:58,758 --> 01:25:02,250
Come on, blow that trombone harder.
That is not a piccolo. Mike.

1665
01:25:02,428 --> 01:25:06,797
You need to act more drunker.
Come on, you guys are better than that.

1666
01:25:06,966 --> 01:25:07,990
Action!

1667
01:25:16,109 --> 01:25:19,704
<i>Let me tell you, rent party</i>
<i>was the place to be in the '20s and '30s.</i>

1668
01:25:19,879 --> 01:25:23,110
<i>Man, they were jumping.</i>

1669
01:25:25,752 --> 01:25:28,516
Clear out, clear out. Cops are coming.
Cops are coming, come on.

1670
01:25:39,031 --> 01:25:40,055
Alma.

1671
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:42,131
Go, go, go.

1672
01:25:42,301 --> 01:25:43,734
Aren't you guys being
a bit ambitious here?

1673
01:25:43,903 --> 01:25:45,370
No. This is what makes the movie.

1674
01:25:45,538 --> 01:25:47,403
All right, all right.
This is getting dangerous.

1675
01:25:47,573 --> 01:25:51,805
- Promise me this is it.
- We promise, Mr. Fletcher.

1676
01:25:51,978 --> 01:25:54,378
Okay, go, go.

1677
01:25:56,783 --> 01:25:58,444
Not the big one, not the big one.

1678
01:25:58,618 --> 01:26:01,178
- What's it matter?
- Do the little one, okay?

1679
01:26:01,354 --> 01:26:03,914
- No, no, no. It says use other door.
- Jee<i>z.</i>

1680
01:26:04,090 --> 01:26:07,355
- Okay, fine, just shield your...
- Just let the car go by.

1681
01:26:17,103 --> 01:26:19,697
- What is this? What the crap?
- God dang it.

1682
01:26:19,872 --> 01:26:22,067
I told you I wanted
to break the big glass.

1683
01:26:30,783 --> 01:26:32,808
Why? It's like a hall of mirrors.

1684
01:26:32,985 --> 01:26:35,385
- What the crap, what is this?
- That's it. I'm going home.

1685
01:26:39,325 --> 01:26:40,451
Come on, let's go.

1686
01:26:41,727 --> 01:26:45,857
- Be careful. It's over there.
- Shut up.

1687
01:26:47,166 --> 01:26:48,724
- You got it?
- Yep.

1688
01:26:48,901 --> 01:26:51,870
You got it?

1689
01:26:52,505 --> 01:26:53,699
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1690
01:26:53,873 --> 01:26:55,340
What...?

1691
01:26:55,508 --> 01:26:57,237
Mike?

1692
01:26:57,410 --> 01:27:00,277
- Mike, what are you doing?
- Nothing. We were leaving, don't hurt us.

1693
01:27:00,446 --> 01:27:03,279
- Of course I'm not gonna hurt you.
- Why do you got that knife then?

1694
01:27:03,449 --> 01:27:05,781
- I thought you were robbers, man.
- Jerry, help me.

1695
01:27:05,952 --> 01:27:08,011
Okay, hold on. Hold on, hold on.

1696
01:27:08,187 --> 01:27:10,155
Release.

1697
01:27:13,826 --> 01:27:17,660
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

1698
01:27:17,830 --> 01:27:20,094
Are you...? Are you sleeping here?

1699
01:27:20,266 --> 01:27:22,029
I n the hardcore-porn room?

1700
01:27:22,201 --> 01:27:25,693
Temporarily, yes,
I am sleeping here, okay?

1701
01:27:25,872 --> 01:27:27,806
I don't want anybody
to know this, all right, please?

1702
01:27:27,974 --> 01:27:28,998
Fellas, I tell you what.

1703
01:27:29,175 --> 01:27:32,770
I'll fix the windows,
you keep that quiet.

1704
01:27:32,945 --> 01:27:33,969
- Okay.
- Please.

1705
01:27:34,146 --> 01:27:35,579
We just gonna go.

1706
01:27:35,748 --> 01:27:38,478
Okay, let's go. Stealth.

1707
01:27:47,894 --> 01:27:50,385
- Don't get involved. Don't get involved.
- Is that it?

1708
01:27:52,365 --> 01:27:54,162
I tried to hold them back
as best I could. Guys, we can't...

1709
01:27:54,333 --> 01:27:55,357
- We got a job to do.
- I know you do.

1710
01:27:55,534 --> 01:27:57,502
- It's on. It's on.
- All right.

1711
01:27:58,871 --> 01:28:01,635
Come on in. Everybody, don't
forget to put money in the can.

1712
01:28:01,807 --> 01:28:04,173
- We're trying to raise money.
- Every dollar helps.

1713
01:28:04,343 --> 01:28:07,779
You know, if you got a 20, that's gonna
help even more. That's more valuable.

1714
01:28:07,947 --> 01:28:09,778
Thank you. Thank you for coming.

1715
01:28:09,949 --> 01:28:11,211
Hey there. Yes, sir. Thank you.

1716
01:28:11,384 --> 01:28:13,011
Make sure you have
a donation for church.

1717
01:28:13,185 --> 01:28:15,983
I will do. All right then. Thank you, sir.
The check will be fine.

1718
01:28:16,155 --> 01:28:17,281
All right.

1719
01:28:17,456 --> 01:28:20,653
Can you put the TV a little bit higher?

1720
01:28:21,961 --> 01:28:22,985
All right.

1721
01:28:23,162 --> 01:28:25,756
This is exciting. Oh, a 20.

1722
01:28:25,932 --> 01:28:27,524
It's gonna work, right?

1723
01:28:27,700 --> 01:28:29,361
Well, I took the offer.

1724
01:28:29,535 --> 01:28:31,628
It looks like we're gonna be
moving to the projects.

1725
01:28:31,804 --> 01:28:35,740
The money we collect tonight is not gonna
be enough to even start the work.

1726
01:28:35,908 --> 01:28:39,867
So, what we gonna do is watch the movie.
And then we go.

1727
01:28:40,046 --> 01:28:41,775
- Come on. All right?
- She can't see the TV.

1728
01:28:41,948 --> 01:28:42,972
- Can you see it now?
- Yeah.

1729
01:28:43,149 --> 01:28:45,674
- Hey, where's Mike?
- Okay.

1730
01:28:45,851 --> 01:28:48,786
Have a little faith, you guys,
he's gonna be here.

1731
01:28:48,955 --> 01:28:52,413
If you can just remain patient,
and don't forget to put money in the can.

1732
01:28:52,591 --> 01:28:56,118
<i>- Mike, Mike, Mike!</i>
- Everybody stay cool.

1733
01:28:56,295 --> 01:29:00,857
<i>Mike, Mike, Mike!</i>

1734
01:29:10,309 --> 01:29:14,541
<i>Who would expect a simple influenza virus</i>
<i>would get him in his bed?</i>

1735
01:29:14,714 --> 01:29:17,683
Mike. Mike, stop shooting now.

1736
01:29:17,850 --> 01:29:20,648
- What are you doing?
- I'm just getting the end shot.

1737
01:29:20,820 --> 01:29:23,254
- I have to get the end titles.
- It doesn't have to be perfect.

1738
01:29:23,422 --> 01:29:27,153
Yeah, I know what time it is.
I've been looking... I've been here all day.

1739
01:29:27,326 --> 01:29:30,727
Yeah. No, we... I didn't start the job.

1740
01:29:30,896 --> 01:29:35,629
I can't demolish a building
with a hundred people in it, that's why.

1741
01:29:35,801 --> 01:29:37,325
Right, good idea.

1742
01:29:37,503 --> 01:29:38,765
He's coming down.

1743
01:29:40,172 --> 01:29:42,106
What is this?

1744
01:29:44,310 --> 01:29:48,303
- Mike's here.
- Hey, look who's here.

1745
01:29:50,483 --> 01:29:53,509
Oh, no.

1746
01:29:55,054 --> 01:29:58,353
No one could see it,
so I had to put it up on a higher thing.

1747
01:29:58,524 --> 01:30:00,788
- You messed up the TV, man.
- I messed up the TV.

1748
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:03,121
So how we gonna watch it?

1749
01:30:05,264 --> 01:30:08,893
Yo, Fletcher.
What the hell's going on here?

1750
01:30:09,068 --> 01:30:13,471
Well, right now, we need you, baby.
We need you.

1751
01:30:13,639 --> 01:30:15,402
- Right here, right here.
- What is that?

1752
01:30:15,574 --> 01:30:18,008
- Is this what you've been looking for?
- It's a projector?

1753
01:30:18,177 --> 01:30:20,941
- Where shall I put the monster?
- Right here, right here.

1754
01:30:21,113 --> 01:30:23,206
Put this right here.
This is the finest machinery...

1755
01:30:23,382 --> 01:30:25,407
...made for mankind.
- Oh, my God.

1756
01:30:25,584 --> 01:30:27,074
- I saved the day.
- Yeah.

1757
01:30:27,253 --> 01:30:29,278
- Okay. That's good.
- It's dangerous in here.

1758
01:30:29,455 --> 01:30:32,049
To tell you the truth, I don't think people
could have seen the little TV...

1759
01:30:32,224 --> 01:30:33,851
...from the back anyway.
It would've been...

1760
01:30:34,026 --> 01:30:35,584
I think everybody should turn around
and watch...

1761
01:30:35,761 --> 01:30:38,229
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Everyone, turn your seats around.

1762
01:30:38,397 --> 01:30:40,661
We're gonna watch the movie
up on the wall now.

1763
01:30:40,833 --> 01:30:42,391
- Yes, we are.
- And it's much better.

1764
01:30:42,568 --> 01:30:44,468
It's actually... It's a blessing in disguise.

1765
01:30:44,637 --> 01:30:46,434
Because the TV...
We were gonna watch it on a TV this big.

1766
01:30:46,605 --> 01:30:47,765
You ain't gonna see an image
brighter than this.

1767
01:30:47,940 --> 01:30:49,532
You will never see an image
sharper than this.

1768
01:30:49,708 --> 01:30:52,939
Now, that's a premiere.
Make it as big as you can.

1769
01:30:53,112 --> 01:30:56,843
Make it as... Yeah.
Stretch it from there all the way to there.

1770
01:30:57,016 --> 01:30:58,916
Anything you need...

1771
01:30:59,085 --> 01:31:01,212
Just keep your hands off this.
This is fine machinery.

1772
01:31:01,387 --> 01:31:04,356
- I will. I promise.
- We did it!

1773
01:31:07,259 --> 01:31:09,625
All right, let's get it going.
Let's get this show on the road.

1774
01:31:09,795 --> 01:31:13,356
- Yeah!
- That's what we waiting for.

1775
01:31:32,384 --> 01:31:36,047
<i>Well, it all began right here,</i>
<i>on this spot.</i>

1776
01:31:36,222 --> 01:31:37,780
<i>It was a different neighborhood then,</i>
<i>but look here...</i>

1777
01:31:37,957 --> 01:31:39,891
<i>... he was born in 261 Main Street.</i>

1778
01:31:40,059 --> 01:31:42,186
<i>It's a boy.</i>

1779
01:31:47,032 --> 01:31:48,431
Here's our part. Here's our part.

1780
01:31:48,601 --> 01:31:51,195
- Yeah, man.
- Yeah!

1781
01:31:52,138 --> 01:31:54,800
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1782
01:32:15,261 --> 01:32:18,424
<i>Yes, in the Century Theater,</i>
<i>right here in Passaic.</i>

1783
01:32:18,597 --> 01:32:20,531
Mr. Fletcher? What's going on?

1784
01:32:20,699 --> 01:32:23,133
Oh, hi, Mr. Baker.

1785
01:32:24,637 --> 01:32:26,901
- Let's step outside.
- Wait, hold on a second, Mr. Fletcher.

1786
01:32:27,072 --> 01:32:28,835
I'm sorry, but time is up.
We agreed on this.

1787
01:32:29,008 --> 01:32:31,272
Now, you must evacuate the building
so we can start.

1788
01:32:31,443 --> 01:32:34,844
Okay. Mr. Baker, you're right.

1789
01:32:35,014 --> 01:32:37,346
We should've evacuated an hour ago.

1790
01:32:37,516 --> 01:32:41,714
But, please,
let us watch our film. Okay?

1791
01:32:41,887 --> 01:32:45,379
And if you give me just one hour,
I promise there won't be a riot.

1792
01:32:45,858 --> 01:32:48,725
An empty building,
and you can pull it down.

1793
01:32:48,894 --> 01:32:50,953
It's all yours.

1794
01:32:51,463 --> 01:32:54,694
- Please.
- You have one hour.

1795
01:32:55,868 --> 01:32:57,130
One hour.

1796
01:33:00,673 --> 01:33:04,473
<i>Fats' life was on a train.</i>

1797
01:33:04,643 --> 01:33:05,940
<i>He had given up flying.</i>

1798
01:33:06,111 --> 01:33:10,275
<i>He was tired of being refused entrance</i>
<i>to the plane because of his color.</i>

1799
01:33:12,451 --> 01:33:15,682
<i>Once, however,</i>
<i>segregation saved his life.</i>

1800
01:33:16,388 --> 01:33:21,223
<i>The plane he had been rejected from</i>
<i>crashed in Kansas City.</i>

1801
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:56,994
<i>Fats, are you okay?</i>

1802
01:33:57,162 --> 01:33:58,561
<i>Fats, you okay?</i>

1803
01:33:59,498 --> 01:34:01,796
<i>Oh, my God, you're... Fats, wake up.</i>

1804
01:34:01,967 --> 01:34:04,299
<i>Fats.</i>

1805
01:34:04,470 --> 01:34:07,098
<i>Is there a doctor on the train?</i>

1806
01:34:07,940 --> 01:34:12,707
<i>Help! Help! Help!</i>
<i>Is there a doctor on the train?</i>

1807
01:34:12,878 --> 01:34:14,175
<i>We need a doctor!</i>

1808
01:34:14,346 --> 01:34:16,678
<i>He 's my friend!</i>

1809
01:34:16,849 --> 01:34:20,945
<i>Anybody? This train 's not leaving</i>
<i>until we get a doctor!</i>

1810
01:36:00,686 --> 01:36:04,713
<i>Say up in Harlem at a table for two</i>

1811
01:36:05,657 --> 01:36:09,354
<i>There were four of us</i>
<i>Me, your big feet and you</i>

1812
01:36:10,028 --> 01:36:12,997
<i>From your ankle up</i>
<i>I'll say you sure are sweet</i>

1813
01:36:13,799 --> 01:36:16,700
<i>From there down</i>
<i>There 's just too much feet</i>

1814
01:36:16,869 --> 01:36:19,303
<i>Yes, your feet's too big</i>

1815
01:36:20,739 --> 01:36:23,173
<i>Don 't want ya 'cause your feet's too big</i>

1816
01:36:24,543 --> 01:36:27,307
<i>Can 't use you 'cause your feet's too big</i>

1817
01:36:28,147 --> 01:36:31,708
<i>I really hate ya 'cause your feet's too big</i>
<i>Yeah</i>

1818
01:36:38,257 --> 01:36:40,316
<i>Where 'd ya get 'em?</i>

1819
01:36:42,394 --> 01:36:45,921
<i>Your girl, she likes you</i>
<i>She thinks you're nice</i>

1820
01:36:46,632 --> 01:36:49,931
<i>Got what it takes to be in paradise</i>

1821
01:36:50,102 --> 01:36:52,002
<i>She said she likes your face</i>

1822
01:36:52,171 --> 01:36:53,968
<i>She likes your rig</i>

1823
01:36:54,740 --> 01:36:57,573
<i>Man, oh, man, them things are too big</i>

1824
01:36:57,743 --> 01:37:00,177
<i>Oh, your feet's too big</i>

1825
01:37:01,013 --> 01:37:04,244
<i>Don 't want ya 'cause your feet's too big</i>

1826
01:37:04,950 --> 01:37:08,477
<i>Mad at you 'cause your feet's too big</i>

1827
01:37:09,588 --> 01:37:11,886
<i>I hate ya 'cause your feet's too big</i>

1828
01:37:30,709 --> 01:37:32,700
<i>Are you good? Is that good?</i>

1829
01:37:33,212 --> 01:37:37,774
This Chinese bamboo ain't strong.
I can't believe you got me out here.

1830
01:37:37,950 --> 01:37:42,250
Forget about the bamboo,
we gotta go solve a crime.

1831
01:37:59,505 --> 01:38:06,343
<i>There 's more to life</i>
<i>Than this old place, hey</i>

1832
01:38:06,745 --> 01:38:11,478
<i>Put your dreams in suitcase</i>

1833
01:38:13,519 --> 01:38:20,322
<i>Go to explore another land</i>

1834
01:38:20,792 --> 01:38:26,992
<i>Stand in a spot you never planned</i>

1835
01:38:27,833 --> 01:38:34,397
<i>You can scoot</i>
<i>Or put down roots</i>

1836
01:38:35,007 --> 01:38:41,242
<i>Use my boot</i>
<i>I'll be there too</i>

1837
01:38:41,914 --> 01:38:47,978
<i>You can scoot</i>
<i>Or put down roots</i>

1838
01:38:48,820 --> 01:38:54,986
<i>Use my boot</i>
<i>They'll be there too</i>

1839
01:38:55,861 --> 01:39:01,891
<i>You'll meet new folks</i>
<i>And listen close</i>

1840
01:39:03,135 --> 01:39:07,572
<i>This song hits brand-new notes</i>

1841
01:39:10,175 --> 01:39:16,410
<i>Our town 's not great</i>
<i>But nothin ' wrong</i>

1842
01:39:17,382 --> 01:39:23,514
<i>Far from the world where we belong</i>

1843
01:39:24,356 --> 01:39:30,420
<i>You can scoot</i>
<i>Or put down roots</i>

1844
01:39:31,396 --> 01:39:37,096
<i>Use my boot</i>
<i>I'll be there too</i>

1845
01:39:38,337 --> 01:39:44,674
<i>You can scoot</i>
<i>Put down roots</i>

1846
01:39:45,344 --> 01:39:51,579
<i>Use my boot</i>
<i>They'll be there too</i>

1847
01:40:06,865 --> 01:40:12,963
<i>Sit before me</i>
<i>Tell your story</i>

1848
01:40:14,039 --> 01:40:18,567
<i>Now here I'm close to you</i>

1849
01:40:21,346 --> 01:40:27,581
<i>Pocket a book</i>
<i>Of letters you got</i>

1850
01:40:28,654 --> 01:40:33,023
<i>I'll tell it better than you thought</i>

1851
01:40:35,994 --> 01:40:42,297
<i>You can scoot</i>
<i>Or put down roots</i>

1852
01:40:43,301 --> 01:40:49,638
<i>Use my boot</i>
<i>I'll be there too</i>

1853
01:40:50,609 --> 01:40:56,605
<i>You can scoot</i>
<i>Put down roots</i>

1854
01:40:57,516 --> 01:41:03,614
<i>Use my boot</i>
<i>I'll be there too</i>

1855
01:41:05,157 --> 01:41:11,619
<i>You can scoot</i>
<i>Put down your roots</i>

1856
01:41:11,797 --> 01:41:18,669
<i>Use my boots</i>
<i>They'll be there too</i>
