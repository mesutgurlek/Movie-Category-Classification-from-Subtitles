00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:36,157

thatIhada veryanxious childhood.

10
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:56,347
You know, my mother
never had time for me.

11
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:59,892
When you´re the middle child
in a family of5 million,

12
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:01,893
you don´t get any attention.

13
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:03,895
I mean,
how is it possible ?

14
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:08,024
And-And I´ve always had these
abandonment issues which plague me.

15
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:11,035
My fatherwas-was basically a drone,
like I´ve said.

16
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:14,368
And, you know, the guy flew away
when I wasjust a larva.

17
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:20,572
And myjob, don´t get me started on,
because it really annoys me.

18
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,581
I-I was not cut out to be a worker,
I´ll tell you right now.

19
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:26,049
I-I-I feel
physically inadequate.

20
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:29,315
Mywhole life,
I´ve never been able to lift...

21
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,822
more than 1 0 times my own bodyweight.

22

And, when you get down to it, handling
dirt is, you know-- [ Shudders ]

23
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:39,630
is not my idea
ofa rewarding career.

24
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:43,031
It´s this whole gung ho,
superorganism thing...

25
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:45,627
that-- that, you know, I can´t get.

26
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:48,206
I try, but I don´t get it.

27
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:51,766
I mean-- What is it ? I´m supposed
to do everything for the colony.

28
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:54,711
And-And what about my needs ?
What about me ?

29
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:57,783
I´ve gotta believe there´s someplace
out there that´s better than this.

30
00:01:57,884 --> 00:02:00,751
Otherwise, I wouldjust curl up
in a larval position and weep.

[ Exhales ]
insignificant.

34
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:10,390
Excellent.

- I have ?

36
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,233
Yes, Z.
You are insignificant.

37
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:17,235

00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:53,957
Okay. I´ve got to keep
a positive attitude.

51
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,230
A good attitude, even though
I´m utterly insignificant.

52

It´s about... this.

'' Be the ball.''

That´s the main thing.
Now, remember that.

You know, gotta be

- Faster. Harder.

that heights make me nauseous ?

been a glitch or two.

But everybody is working
full tilt as it is, and--

00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:18,811
You can´t help it,
it´s your nature.

to explain themselves to Colonel Cutter.

Yes, sir.

- Imagine it !
- A strong colony, sir.

A colonywe can be proud of.

00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,614
Yes, but we´re not thereyet.

109
00:06:57,717 --> 00:07:02,484

a termite army has mobilized against us.

110
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:03,555
Against us ?

111
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:06,523
We´ll have to send troops
deep into hostile territory...

112
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,218
to attack their colony.

113

Attack a termite colony, sir ?

114
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,821
- That´s suicide.
- Exactly.

- Doyou have the list I asked for ?
- Yes, General.

116

These are the units
loyal to the queen.

Hm. Then they´re
the ones we´ll be sending.

It´s a shame.
There´s some fine officers here.

approval to declare war ?

- Theywant our land.

They´re desperate
for more foraging territory.

124
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:48,230
Perhaps they think
we´ve grown soft orweak.

125
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:53,067
Why don´t we dispatch an ambassador,
negotiate a new treaty ?

126
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:56,733
- We don´t need to send soldiers.
- Believe me.

is so precious to me.

- [ Grunts ]
- That´s whywe must strike now.

enter our colony, well--

Yes, General,
I know what they can do to us.

- Verywell.
- You´ve made a wise decision.

In fact, you´ve insured
the future ofthis colony.

just here on business.

Oh, ofcourse-- [ Chuckles ]
ofcourse not.

139
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:42,811
Because, um,
it might be nice...

ifwe had a conversation once
before we get married.

You´re absolutely right.

142
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:52,694

for me and Princess Bala.

Uh, in fact, sir, there is time
right now for a personal moment.

ahead ofschedule.

Excellent.

but I guess ifit´s quality time--

00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:12,377
So, how was your day ?

149

-Anything interestinghappen ?
- We declared war.

150

Declared war ?

151
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:20,959
Boy, talk about a rough day.

152

but time stands still for no ant.
