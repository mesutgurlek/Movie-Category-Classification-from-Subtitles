1
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:31,226
Arthur?

2
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:36,458
- Arthur.
- Yeah.

3
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:40,766
Are you thinking about the question?

4
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,641
- Are you Japanese?
- No.

5
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:50,816
Mieko Tatsuri is Japanese.

6
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:54,310
Who is Mieko Tatsuri?

7
00:00:55,955 --> 00:00:58,014
She's the leader of Blowback.

8
00:00:58,124 --> 00:01:04,085
Her father is a ninja and her mother
is an alien from the gamma sector.

9
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:07,133
Okay. Well, I'm Korean. From Earth.

10
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:11,963
Is that going to be on the test?

11
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:14,973
- No. There's no test.
- Well, I thought...

12
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:17,809
I thought I was being tested.

13
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:21,711
No. This is an evaluation, Arthur.
It's different than a test.

14
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:24,340
Can we get back to the question?

15
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,956
Okay.
Why did you assault Mr. Debrofkowitz?

16
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:40,731
Debrofkowitz. Debrofkowitz. Debrofkowitz.
Debrofkowitz. Debrofkowitz?

17
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:44,165
You smashed up his dry cleaning business.

18
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:47,696
Top secret.

19
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:38,882
Look out, termites. It's squishing time.

20
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:44,085
There's a couple of options here.

21
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:46,631
One, the cops in this town are incompetent.

22
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:49,861
Two, they're underfunded,
and that's a real possibility.

23
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:51,597
And three, they're crooked.

24
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:53,604
How do you think this city
got its nickname, "Hammertown"?

25
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:56,106
How about some fricking music?

26
00:02:57,443 --> 00:03:01,277
- Fuck you. I like this guy.
- I'm sure you do. He's a dink.

27
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:06,617
Are you going to work for it
or are you going to pay for it?

28
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:10,445
- What’s this?
- It's like a present. You have to wrap it.

29
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:12,718
No, no.
That's not going to work for me, honey.

30
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:16,660
Yeah, well, using nothing's
not going to work for me. So...

31
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:19,658
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?

32
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:29,832
What was that?

33
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:33,276
What was that? Wait. Hey, where you going?

34
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:41,576
Garbage days. Remember the garbage days.

35
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:45,422
Stop! You're hurting my arm.

36
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:46,788
Well, that's just
an occupational hazard, honey.

37
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:49,987
- Stop, Dooney! Chill the fuck out!
- Come on.

38
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:52,189
Come on. Let's just do this slow.
We can make it last.

39
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:53,822
- Yeah. That's what I want.
- Okay, relax!

40
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:55,366
- That's what I want.
- Okay.

41
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:58,198
Do it slow. That's it. Make it last. That's it.

42
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:09,943
Hey, there's been a misunderstanding.

43
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:11,608
Step out of the car, please.

44
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:16,314
Hey, buddy, that's my line.

45
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:21,157
Chuck Dooney, Drug Squad.

46
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:27,522
- Who the fuck are you supposed to be?
- Your worst nightmare.

47
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:33,804
Go on. Make like a rocket. Take off.

48
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:35,363
You messed up.

49
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:39,869
- I want Captain Industry.
- Who?

50
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,177
Listen, fuckhead!
I don't know who you talking about.

51
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:46,412
Wrong answer.

52
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,224
There you go, hon.

53
00:04:57,997 --> 00:05:01,763
Just taking a break.
Then I'm going to get back to work.

54
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:50,341
To all officers. White male, six feet tall,
dressed in black tights with silver trim.

55
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,644
Wanted on a 245A.

56
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:53,514
- Assaulting an officer with a deadly weapon.
- There you go.

57
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:55,678
- Thank you.
- Apprehend with caution.

58
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:08,661
- Hey, partner?
- Cream and sugar, Mikey. Cream and sugar.

59
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,832
Get your fucking hands up right now!
Put that coffee down...

60
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,636
Let's fucking go.
Behind your head, come on! Let's go!

61
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:33,356
- Is that the camera?
- Yeah, which feeds into this VCR.

62
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:38,494
- That business with Dooney.
- Is he pressing charges?

63
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:40,826
No, no. He says he wants it
done the old-fashioned way.

64
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:45,200
- Course he does.
- Stupid dumb cops. Dumb stupid cops.

65
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:47,465
- Name?
- No, he stonewalled me.

66
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:51,306
Captain, this guy is pretty funny.

67
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:54,642
He says he wants to call a truce.

68
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:57,683
- A vigilante?
- No. No, he's a superhero.

69
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,679
He calls himself Defendor.

70
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:05,383
And that's with an O-R, Captain.
It's not an E-R. Defendor.

71
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:09,257
And he flips out if you get that wrong.
It's very bizarre.

72
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:16,562
- Commissioner, this is outrageous.
- Yeah. Yeah, sure it is.

73
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:20,002
Why don't you calm down and have a seat?

74
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:31,783
My grandfather fought in the trenches
in the Great War.

75
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:34,182
I remember him showing me one of these.

76
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:37,051
Was your grandfather an infantryman?

77
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,515
Yes, he was.

78
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:45,393
Probably passed on to his reward now,
hasn't he?

79
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:49,929
It's 20... 20...

80
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:54,297
Twenty-six years ago.

81
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,969
I wonder if your grandfather and
my grandfather

82
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:00,477
bumped into each other up there.

83
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:06,440
- What did you say his name was?
- Henry Poppington.

84
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:11,590
Wouldn't surprise me.

85
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:15,553
Pretty sturdy weapon you got here.

86
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,926
It has the blood
of a thousand Germans on it.

87
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:21,296
Does it have the blood
of an undercover policeman on it?

88
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,301
You strike one of my officers with this?

89
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,097
No.

90
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:34,912
When you break the law, you're a punk.

91
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:39,415
When you break the law with a badge,
you're a punk with a badge.

92
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:41,112
I don't strike officers.

93
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:44,452
Punks? Different story.

94
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,691
Well, you strike me
as a man of great integrity.

95
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:54,524
Great men know each other by name.

96
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:58,362
Roger Fairbanks.

97
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:02,870
Arthur Poppington.

98
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:13,684
Sir, nice work in there. Very Columbo.

99
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:18,286
Yeah, run Arthur Poppington
through the system, see what comes up.

100
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:22,191
Confiscate his trench club,
give him back his marbles

101
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:25,890
and the rest of this stuff,
and send him on his way, huh?

102
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:33,028
All right, so here's your marbles.
Stay out of trouble, all right?

103
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:38,834
Trouble has a way of following me.
Where's my trench club?

104
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:40,305
No, forget about that.

105
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:44,873
Just run along
and get some sleep, Defendor.

106
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:55,415
There are at least eight ways to break out
of this dump. I'm taking the front door.

107
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:03,619
I think, for a large portion of your life,
you've been misunderstood.

108
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,628
And now, at this stage, more people...

109
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:15,164
Okay. Okay, you sit. You sit down. Okay.

110
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:23,845
Okay. Do you remember
what we were talking about?

111
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:31,718
Let me assure you, Arthur,
that whatever you say here

112
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:35,521
is for the judge's ears only.
And mine, of course.

113
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:40,564
- Totally classified?
- Totally.

114
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:47,833
Seriously, on my drive home,
I go through these neighborhoods.

115
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:52,401
I see these girls out there.
They can't be more than 16 years old.

116
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:55,511
Do you think I'm joking? I'm not.

117
00:11:55,581 --> 00:12:00,211
What is this, Thailand? Because if we're
going to stand for this, hell, let's advertise.

118
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:03,345
"Come on down to the Hammer
and have sex with our children."

119
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:05,890
At least that way we'll bring in the tourists.

120
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:09,483
All right, let's go to the tribal brain trust
and see what's out there.

121
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,258
- Line three, go ahead.
- You should be ashamed of yourself

122
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:15,595
to suggest exploiting those poor girls.
It's disgusting.

123
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:18,101
Lady, it's called sarcasm.

124
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:24,773
Hello? Hello? All right, she hung up.
Next caller, you're on the air.

125
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:43,082
- Fucking guy!
- Come on, man! I'm just talking.

126
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,487
- Come on!
- Get the fuck out of here!

127
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:48,651
- I'm just messing with you, man!
- Come here. I'm gonna kill you, Dooney!

128
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:50,854
You got to learn
how to laugh a little bit, Cliff!

129
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:54,160
Lighten up! Hey. Hey.

130
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:58,629
Now, what are you doing with our wall
over here?

131
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:01,006
Hey, come here. Come here.

132
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:05,169
Somebody call the police!

133
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:08,508
Police! Help, police!

134
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:13,017
We're sick and tired of having
people like you deface our city walls!

135
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:16,549
Why don't you pick on
someone your own size?

136
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:21,857
Boys, this is...

137
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:24,861
This is the retard
that I was telling you about.

138
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:27,364
I thought they got you. Did they...

139
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:29,832
Why don't you let the kid go?

140
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:32,564
Who writes your dialog? Superman?

141
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:36,365
No. I write it myself.

142
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:39,569
You know what?
You need a good ghost writer.

143
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:42,578
- Somebody with talent.
- No.

144
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:45,074
You need a ghost writer.

145
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:49,716
'Cause that's what you're going to be
after I pulverize you.

146
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:56,521
- What? What’s that?
- A jar.

147
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,760
- So, what is it supposed to do?
- Very little.

148
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:05,897
Except contain a swarm of angry wasps.

149
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:16,044
Get the fucking retard!

150
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:28,116
Come on! Lights on, Dog! Lights!

151
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:31,596
Lights, Dog. Lights on, Dog. Lights on!

152
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:36,558
Lights! Lights on! I said lights on!

153
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:44,041
Who wants to go first? Okay then.

154
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,878
Why don't I go first?

155
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:26,641
...my fucking elbow.

156
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,870
Fay! Come on, let's go!

157
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:52,102
Just give me a second.
I want to say goodbye.

158
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:02,379
Hey, Arthur.

159
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:05,317
Hey, smelly.

160
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:07,618
Hey.

161
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:10,322
Wake up. Wake up.

162
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:12,557
You gotta get up. Come on.

163
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:27,906
I'm going to go away for awhile.
Make some cash.

164
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:34,414
Come on. You can do it. There you go.
You can do it. You can do it.

165
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,680
Good job. Good job.

166
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:37,847
When are you coming back?

167
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:42,557
Soon, little man.
Grandpa's going to take care of you.

168
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,956
Just a couple of months.

169
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:57,737
Okay. Okay. Come on. You're a big boy now.

170
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,937
- Look out there. What do you see?
- The moon.

171
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:06,376
Wherever I am, you just look at that moon.

172
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,813
'Cause we can always see the same moon.

173
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,892
Mommy? Mommy?

174
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:19,321
Sure. Whatever you're into. But I'm not
running a charity here. You need money.

175
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:22,093
You just keep looking at that moon,
little man.

176
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:26,964
- That's where I'll be at.
- Let's go, baby.

177
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:34,843
Hey. Hey.
You want me to be your mommy, right?

178
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:38,982
Come on. Let's go to your place.
Come on. There you go. Okay.

179
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,831
What is this place?

180
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,998
It's a secret base.

181
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:23,522
You live here? Cool.

182
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:31,729
You know, you really messed
with my situation the other day.

183
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:37,539
Messed with your... Who are you?

184
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,673
- Angel.
- Angel?

185
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:45,476
"Make like a rocket. Take off." Remember?
That was me, Wordsworth.

186
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:48,179
You fucked everything up that night.

187
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,389
What are you doing?

188
00:19:56,762 --> 00:20:00,755
This? It's a little bling-bling.
You want to try?

189
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:05,428
It's like medicine. It'll make you feel really,
really good. Here, look.

190
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:12,205
That stuff is bad.

191
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:15,404
Your momma tell you that?

192
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:21,011
She died. Her name was Fay.

193
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,718
Shit. Sorry.

194
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:28,588
Look, I got another way
to make you feel good. You ready?

195
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,252
Ready for what?

196
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:34,925
- What does the wind do?
- The wind? The wind?

197
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:39,129
The wind, the wind, the wind, the wind,
the wind, the wind, the wind...

198
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:42,071
It swishes everything around.

199
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,235
Yeah?

200
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:49,706
It swishes everything around. Okay.

201
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:51,943
You have to go.

202
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:57,482
Well, Meal Ticket's a little pissed off
right now.

203
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:02,458
Soon as he calms down, I'm gone.
Couple of days, all right?

204
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:59,274
Number one?

205
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:03,350
Shit, that's got to be worth something.

206
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:13,788
- I tripped.
- You tripped?

207
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:18,864
- Down some steps.
- Bullshit. Who did this to you?

208
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,961
What'd they look like?

209
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:26,007
Arthur, don't fucking lie to me.
How are your ribs?

210
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:30,571
- It only hurts when I breathe.
- Jesus! Give me this.

211
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:37,244
Come on. We're going to the hospital.

212
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:43,917
Arthur, we're going to the hospital. Let's go.

213
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:49,998
- How many guys?
- Ten or twelve.

214
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:53,504
Jesus, Arthur. Did you provoke them?

215
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,836
- You know what "provoke" means?
- Yes.

216
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:02,740
You lost a tooth, pal. You got to do
some provoking to lose a tooth.

217
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:05,339
- Trying to save someone.
- How is he?

218
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,720
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack.

219
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:13,191
Hey, Arthur. How are you? You hungry?

220
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:15,020
- We brought some dinner.
- Meatloaf.

221
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:17,786
- Meatloaf!
- Who did this, Paul?

222
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:22,094
I don't know. He says ten or twelve guys.
He was trying to save somebody.

223
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,929
Arthur Poppington?

224
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:29,574
It's okay. Take it on in with you.
He won't mind.

225
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:46,651
- What does this teach us, Jack?
- Next time have a gun.

226
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:49,283
- Hey. Don't be a wise ass.
- But...

227
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:53,190
No, it teaches us
that fighting never solves anything.

228
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:55,765
- Mom.
- Sometimes a good knock in the teeth

229
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:57,426
- isn't such a bad...
- Paul!

230
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:02,266
But, Mom, is it okay to fight
if you're trying to save someone?

231
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:08,835
The Mayor's all over me, Roger.

232
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,778
We're going to have a problem
with these bikers?

233
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:12,680
No. No. No. I got a man deep inside.

234
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:15,947
Yeah, I got a wire tap before the judge
as we speak.

235
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:17,989
You need money, resources,
just say the word.

236
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:19,546
And I appreciate your support, Chief,

237
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:22,126
but I can't let anybody,
even in the department, know about this.

238
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:24,992
Sit down and shut your fucking face.

239
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:28,664
Shoot. I... I got to call you back there, Chief.

240
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:35,400
- Hey, Captain.
- Dooney, Dooney, golly.

241
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,003
What the hell? Are you all right?

242
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:40,909
- Did you just say "golly"?
- I did, yeah.

243
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:45,573
Hey, listen, there's a rumor out there

244
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:50,383
about some sting operation on the bikers.

245
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:52,714
You hear anything about that?

246
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:55,315
No. No. Well, where did you hear about this?

247
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:58,191
I don't know. People talk, you know.

248
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:04,995
I didn't think much about it,
but thought I'd ask.

249
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:08,164
- Since it's my turf, right?
- Right.

250
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:21,849
Anyway, I'm going to process this shithead
and cut out early.

251
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:26,118
- It's my weekend with the girls.
- Good, good. Family's important.

252
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:30,554
Hey, you be careful out there, huh?

253
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,451
What’s that stand for?

254
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:58,956
- Defendor.
- Defender?

255
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:02,553
- Defendor!
- Oh, my God.

256
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:06,825
- Jesus. How do you spell that?
- I know how to spell it!

257
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:09,657
Relax, guy.

258
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:13,666
I can't relax. Not when there are
people out there that need me.

259
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:14,931
Who needs you?

260
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:17,566
- Who needs you?
- I asked you first.

261
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:24,145
- I'm looking for someone.
- Yeah, who?

262
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:28,752
- Captain Industry.
- Who's that?

263
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,021
Evil mastermind.

264
00:26:31,823 --> 00:26:34,451
He smuggles drugs.

265
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:40,123
- I probably know him, then. Radovan?
- Radovan?

266
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:43,656
- Yeah. He's a real fucker, man.
- Radovan?

267
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:51,001
No. No, I don't think so.
I don't think that's Captain Industry.

268
00:26:51,476 --> 00:26:55,503
No? Okay then. 'Cause this guy's pretty evil.

269
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:02,280
Well, do you think he might be
Captain Industry?

270
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:10,157
Do I think he's Captain...

271
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:13,197
Do I think Radovan Kristic
is Captain Industry?

272
00:27:13,898 --> 00:27:16,332
Yeah. I think he is. For sure.

273
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:22,672
- Radovan...
- Kristic.

274
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:26,802
Kristic. Kristic. Radovan Kristic.
Radovan Kristic. Radovan Kristic.

275
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:31,247
He's an evil mastermind.
He's killed, like, a bunch of people.

276
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:35,643
- And you know him?
- Been to his house, man.

277
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,311
He's bringing girls in from Moldova now.

278
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:41,917
Sex slaves, drugs, guns.
He's into all of that shit.

279
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,362
- Show me.
- Excuse me? He is Serbian militia.

280
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:49,366
He's got these two huge-assed dudes
around him all the time.

281
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:52,835
- You'd never get within a mile of him.
- I can handle two big-assed dudes.

282
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:53,996
You can?

283
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:58,236
You mean like last time when
I peeled you off the pavement, you mean?

284
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:04,537
No. Do you think those guys
work for Captain Industry?

285
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:08,510
Well, if Radovan Kristic is Captain Industry,

286
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:12,886
yes, because everybody works for him.
He's in with the bikers now.

287
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:15,384
How do you know all that?

288
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:20,429
I was his favorite girl for, like, five minutes.

289
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:23,362
What are you doing?

290
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:27,132
- I'm going to get him.
- Forget it. I'm not helping you.

291
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:31,472
- Listen, young lady.
- Don't "young lady" me, buddy.

292
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:35,410
- I'm not telling you shit. You're a joke.
- I'm not a joke!

293
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:58,963
Captain Industry, where does he live?

294
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:04,673
Well, that kind of information
doesn't just grow on trees.

295
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:13,647
This information, this cost you $40 a day?

296
00:29:14,986 --> 00:29:20,583
Well, she knew a lot of stuff.
It was important information.

297
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:24,292
You think that's too expensive?

298
00:29:24,662 --> 00:29:29,258
Because on The Rockford Files,
it always cost Rockford for information.

299
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,664
- Did I get that wrong?
- No. There's no right or wrong here.

300
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:40,143
Well, if there's no right or wrong here,
how come I have to stay here?

301
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:41,769
Where would you rather be?

302
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:45,710
Out there. Fighting crime.

303
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:35,566
What the fuck is this?

304
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:46,436
- Angel.
- Oh, my God!

305
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:50,036
- You scared the shit out of me!
- What are you doing?

306
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:54,617
What? What’s the problem? I'm not...
My name isn't even Angel.

307
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:57,653
Here. You can have your comic back, too.

308
00:30:57,755 --> 00:30:59,916
First issue. You think it's worth something?
You're wrong.

309
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:01,788
Some geek offered me four bucks for it.

310
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:06,227
Apparently Strontium 90
and the Hellbound Gang sucks balls.

311
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:11,592
You shouldn't take other people's stuff.

312
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:16,129
Really? Thanks for the tip.
Should I suck your cock now?

313
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:22,140
You must be tired. Goodnight.

314
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:50,937
- What’s your real name?
- Kat.

315
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:54,544
Katerina.

316
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:00,517
Katerina Debrofkowitz.

317
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:07,852
Kat. Kat. Kat. Katerina Debrofkowitz.
Katerina Debrofkowitz.

318
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:14,028
Well, why do you lie?

319
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:17,158
I'm good at it.

320
00:32:18,736 --> 00:32:20,897
What else are you good at?

321
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:26,067
- Get guys off pretty good.
- What else?

322
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:33,746
I used to get A's in English.

323
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:38,046
English? Like a writer?

324
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:44,655
Mrs. Shaw thought I was pretty good.
But that was like, you know, four years ago.

325
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:48,721
You should be a writer like Lois Lane.

326
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:51,897
Yeah, Lois Lane. That's me.

327
00:32:57,608 --> 00:32:59,667
So, well,

328
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:04,677
did you lie about other stuff,

329
00:33:07,785 --> 00:33:12,222
like being Captain Industry's girlfriend
and knowing where he lives?

330
00:33:13,057 --> 00:33:14,354
Sort of.

331
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:20,760
It's all up a hill, like a mountain,

332
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,100
and then it starts smelling like shit.

333
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:28,935
Which I think is the stables,
'cause you hear airplanes.

334
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:33,209
I was blindfolded.

335
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:39,541
He lives way out there somewhere.

336
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:56,097
It's okay. It's okay.

337
00:33:57,568 --> 00:34:01,299
That's it. I'll wait for you out here.

338
00:34:04,675 --> 00:34:06,575
- What do I do?
- Whatever he wants.

339
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:13,341
He's the nice man
that paid for you to come out here, so...

340
00:34:17,288 --> 00:34:19,017
Come on, be a good girl.

341
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:22,183
It's going to be over
before you know it, okay?

342
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:25,326
Come on. Hey. Hey. Don't cry.

343
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:30,323
Hey, do you want some of this?

344
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,534
It'll give you some courage.

345
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:39,308
Okay. You'll be all right.

346
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:15,244
Dooney. You want to know
where Captain Industry lives? Ask Dooney.

347
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:16,836
Remember him?

348
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:22,076
Well, you better,
'cause he's going to remember you, buddy.

349
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:26,179
- Where is he?
- Well, he's usually at the clubhouse,

350
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:29,749
especially since the wife grew some grapes
and kicked him out.

351
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:31,192
Grapes?

352
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:34,487
It's in the 'hood. I'll show you.

353
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:39,225
Grapes. Grew grapes. Grew green grapes.
Grew green grapes.

354
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:22,610
- Come on, little friend. Get in there.
- Arthur, they're going to sting you.

355
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:27,242
- They're sleepy.
- "Sleepy" means "pissed off".

356
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:30,315
Oh, God, I can't watch.

357
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:56,208
I'm not kidding around.

358
00:36:58,516 --> 00:37:00,108
I'm serious.

359
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:10,191
You're going to jail.

360
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:34,579
Fuck!

361
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:38,177
Who's there?

362
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:10,513
- Shit.
- We meet again.

363
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:13,216
Yeah, here we go. "We meet again."

364
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:21,554
Hey, listen. I think I can...
I think I can help you.

365
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:26,733
- I'm listening.
- That's good. You're listening, that's good.

366
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:33,634
Listen, you got a beef with me. Fine.

367
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:39,272
But you know what else you got?
A fucking death wish!

368
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:48,052
- Where's Captain Industry?
- Fuck, man. Not this again, man.

369
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:55,827
What’s that? Lime... It's lime juice.

370
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:59,232
Come on! Please, God, not the lime juice!

371
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:04,240
Fuck! Fuck!

372
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:11,339
Shit! I don't know anything about this guy,
this Captain Industry.

373
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:14,680
Just listen,
this Captain Industry doesn't exist.

374
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:18,186
You know what? You're sick, man.
You need help. You know that?

375
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:21,952
There's no Captain Industry.
There's no Captain anybody!

376
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:27,622
- What...
- Somewhere near the airplanes.

377
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:32,759
Somewhere near the smell of poo.
I need an address.

378
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:36,669
Hey, retard.

379
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:39,442
Look at me.

380
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:42,675
You're a dead man.

381
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:48,785
Come on. Not that! Stop! God!

382
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,492
- Fuck!
- I want an address!

383
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:02,190
Okay! Okay! Fuck!

384
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:06,624
...extra large...

385
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:17,201
...double cheese,
double cheese and with Italian sausage.

386
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:19,569
Wow, Arthur, you really got something here.

387
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:23,135
I saw him, Kat. Captain Industry.

388
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:26,917
And he's really fat.

389
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:31,649
Yeah, that's him.
Crime of the century. Ordering pizza.

390
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:35,491
Come on. Let's clean you up.

391
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,719
Stop moving.

392
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:47,466
Why do you smoke bling?
Such a nice person.

393
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:51,942
- I don't know how nice I am.
- Nice to me.

394
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:54,942
Well, you're paying me, right?

395
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,777
You don't have to be nice.

396
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:02,852
Don't put all this shit on me, all right?
I'm not who you think I am.

397
00:42:03,487 --> 00:42:05,250
Who are you, then?

398
00:42:06,423 --> 00:42:09,859
I'm just a girl trying to make some money.

399
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:14,653
- Money helps you forget about stuff.
- Forget what?

400
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:18,760
Stop with the questions, all right?

401
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:23,437
Well, why do you smoke that stuff?

402
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:27,139
Why do you dress up like a superhero?

403
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:34,013
'Cause superheroes aren't stupid.

404
00:42:34,852 --> 00:42:36,649
They're not afraid.

405
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:41,017
And when I'm Defendor,
I'm not Arthur any more.

406
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:43,924
I'm a million times better than Arthur.

407
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:49,764
Well, when I smoke that stuff,
I'm not afraid or stupid.

408
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:53,595
I'm not me, either. It's the same.

409
00:42:55,940 --> 00:43:00,104
Yeah, but you should want to be you
because you're really pretty.

410
00:43:04,848 --> 00:43:08,944
- I could help you.
- I don't need anybody's help.

411
00:43:10,554 --> 00:43:12,454
Everybody needs help.

412
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:18,551
Even superheroes.

413
00:43:20,564 --> 00:43:23,431
- Good.
- Even superheroes.

414
00:43:23,968 --> 00:43:26,061
Hold your face still.

415
00:43:28,238 --> 00:43:29,705
Don't move.

416
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:35,769
Last week a teenage kid gets caught
with a gun in his locker.

417
00:43:36,046 --> 00:43:38,446
He was 15 years old.

418
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:40,949
Where did he get it?
What was he going to do with it?

419
00:43:41,051 --> 00:43:43,542
It turns out, he's running crack.

420
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:47,614
And surprise, surprise,
the kid's in cahoots with the bikers.

421
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:50,961
Please, somebody, anybody,

422
00:43:51,061 --> 00:43:55,589
if you think you've got a good idea
on how to stop this anarchy, call me.

423
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:58,260
I want to hear from you.
Caller, go ahead. You're on the air.

424
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:01,395
Yeah, you keep talking about the problems
with the drugs and the guns...

425
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:04,270
- Yes? Your point, sir?
- If you'd stop talking about it...

426
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:06,935
Then what? The problem goes away?

427
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:33,169
Now I can't see my kid next week
because my car has got a flat tire.

428
00:44:33,971 --> 00:44:36,531
- Is that right?
- Whores in the back.

429
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,438
Come on, let's go.

430
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:59,857
The cargo's left Odessa.
It'll arrive in three weeks.

431
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:03,894
The guns and the girls.

432
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:10,397
Sometimes some of the girls,
they don't survive.

433
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:12,307
It's sad.

434
00:45:13,577 --> 00:45:18,037
But the guns? No problem.
The guns are always happy.

435
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:23,913
North, south, east, and west.

436
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:27,348
Everything will be ours.

437
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:30,521
Easy.

438
00:45:30,928 --> 00:45:35,331
But first, we must throw out the trash.

439
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:37,034
This is the most important thing.

440
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:37,762
This is the most important thing.

441
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,198
Go! Go!

442
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:45,766
Go!

443
00:46:18,075 --> 00:46:21,238
- You go that way, and I'll go this way.
- Right.

444
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:17,861
The guy's a fucking Houdini. Oh, man.

445
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:21,767
Guys, the retard is unbelievable. It's crazy.

446
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:27,004
Is this the same retard who messed you up?

447
00:47:27,644 --> 00:47:31,307
Yeah. That's right. 'Cause he's the only one
who's stupid enough.

448
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:36,282
You're a man, yes?

449
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:40,884
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Yeah. Oh, yeah.

450
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:51,990
Please. Kill this fly.

451
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:04,737
Commissioner.

452
00:48:05,315 --> 00:48:07,215
Have mercy. How did you get in here?

453
00:48:07,317 --> 00:48:11,811
There'll be time for questions later.
Right now, I need your help.

454
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:14,152
Arthur Poppington.

455
00:48:15,325 --> 00:48:18,988
Use my other name, okay?
It works better that way.

456
00:48:19,863 --> 00:48:23,355
Just call me Defendor. I have tapes.

457
00:48:24,434 --> 00:48:26,902
This one, they ordered pizza.

458
00:48:27,704 --> 00:48:30,104
This night, they ordered fried chicken.

459
00:48:30,707 --> 00:48:33,198
This one, Chinese food.

460
00:48:34,211 --> 00:48:38,511
This one is from the clubhouse,
and they just swear a lot.

461
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:43,345
And then, I recorded this one.

462
00:48:45,622 --> 00:48:49,388
North, south, east, and west.

463
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:53,893
Everything will be ours. Easy.

464
00:48:54,331 --> 00:48:56,993
There. There. That's Dooney there.

465
00:48:58,068 --> 00:49:01,094
What are you talking about?
That could be anybody.

466
00:49:01,171 --> 00:49:03,662
And you can't just go around
videotaping people, okay?

467
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:05,241
It's got to be corroborated.

468
00:49:05,309 --> 00:49:07,402
- Colob...
- Corroborated.

469
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:11,073
Corroborated. Verified. Proven.
It's got to be proved.

470
00:49:11,148 --> 00:49:14,083
Maybe if you got a better angle
or something.

471
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:15,778
A better angle.

472
00:49:17,087 --> 00:49:20,284
Look, now you're meddling
in police business.

473
00:49:20,357 --> 00:49:22,188
You're going to have to follow me.

474
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:26,319
You know, do you like finger painting?
'Cause finger painting's an activity that...

475
00:49:33,937 --> 00:49:36,531
Where the hell were you? I was worried sick.

476
00:49:38,342 --> 00:49:40,503
Gross. You stink again, Arthur.

477
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:43,443
Sorry. We need more tapes, Kat.

478
00:49:43,513 --> 00:49:46,141
Captain Industry was there,
and Dooney and everyone.

479
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:52,521
Can we get more tapes, Kat?

480
00:49:52,622 --> 00:49:56,285
All right, I heard you the first time.
I'm going. You have any money?

481
00:49:59,363 --> 00:50:02,332
- One, two...
- Three, four. Yeah, I know. Thank you.

482
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,307
Who the fuck are you?

483
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:12,740
Fuck you!

484
00:50:28,925 --> 00:50:30,187
Arthur?

485
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:35,423
Paul. What are you doing here?

486
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:38,501
What am l...
What the fuck are you doing here?

487
00:50:38,568 --> 00:50:42,060
And what about that girl? The girl.

488
00:50:44,241 --> 00:50:46,402
The little floozy who just left here.

489
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:49,502
- A girl just left here?
- Never mind. Are you living here?

490
00:50:51,114 --> 00:50:54,845
I... I don't have anywhere else to live, Paul.

491
00:50:54,918 --> 00:50:57,216
What about the rooming house?

492
00:50:58,255 --> 00:51:00,018
I got into a fight.

493
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:02,456
Again? Jesus Christ.

494
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:05,050
That's why I didn't want to say.

495
00:51:05,128 --> 00:51:08,063
You know, it's just when you make
these decisions without telling me.

496
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:09,758
You know, you could have
stayed at our house.

497
00:51:09,866 --> 00:51:12,926
At least until we find you something decent.

498
00:51:14,438 --> 00:51:16,065
I don't want to stay at your house, Paul.

499
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:18,437
Well, you can't just take up in a workshop.

500
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:21,636
I mean, I can get in some serious shit
if someone finds out about this.

501
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:23,770
And the hooker?
I mean, fucking hell, Arthur.

502
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,815
- You have a potty mouth, Paul!
- You know, I am so close to choking you!

503
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:31,286
She's not a hooker! She's a friend! Jeez!

504
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:39,996
You're an adult.
You make your own decisions, right?

505
00:51:42,566 --> 00:51:44,830
You coming back to work soon?

506
00:51:45,469 --> 00:51:46,595
Yeah.

507
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:50,599
Here.

508
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:54,441
Here. I want you to have this.

509
00:51:55,912 --> 00:51:57,971
I'll get myself a new one.

510
00:51:58,682 --> 00:52:03,676
That right there is the home number, okay?
You press that button, I'm on your doorstep.

511
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:07,587
You know, if anything comes up, or
anything happens here, you call me, okay?

512
00:52:07,657 --> 00:52:09,488
And don't worry about the minutes
or whatever.

513
00:52:09,593 --> 00:52:11,993
I got that family package thing.

514
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:14,194
Okay. All right, guy.

515
00:52:18,768 --> 00:52:19,928
Yeah.

516
00:52:21,204 --> 00:52:22,296
Okay, buddy.

517
00:52:22,372 --> 00:52:24,101
He sounds like a good friend.

518
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:27,502
Why do you think that is?

519
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:29,478
I don't know.

520
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,538
I have a theory.

521
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:36,051
Theory of gravity.
Apple fell and bumped him on the head.

522
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:39,122
Yes, but this is a different theory.

523
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:43,455
It's a theory of why everyone
is so fond of you.

524
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:50,394
No. People tease me a lot.
Especially since Henry died.

525
00:52:51,868 --> 00:52:55,964
That must have been very painful.
Children can be very cruel sometimes.

526
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:59,706
Adults are the worst.

527
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:05,314
You're probably right about that.
But do you want to hear my theory?

528
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:08,674
You're honest.

529
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:12,010
I lie sometimes.

530
00:53:12,989 --> 00:53:17,016
Yes, but mostly you're kind
and you care for people.

531
00:53:17,827 --> 00:53:19,658
You're a good person.

532
00:53:21,565 --> 00:53:26,229
Which is why I don't understand,
why did you assault Mr. Debrofkowitz?

533
00:53:33,577 --> 00:53:36,671
I was really mad.

534
00:53:37,581 --> 00:53:39,049
We need to get more tapes.

535
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:39,572
We need to get more tapes.

536
00:53:39,683 --> 00:53:43,813
Yes, I know. There's places up here.
Security's lav.

537
00:53:51,461 --> 00:53:53,429
Kat, what's the matter?

538
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:56,930
Who is it?

539
00:53:58,668 --> 00:53:59,999
My father.

540
00:54:01,271 --> 00:54:03,501
I didn't know you had a father.

541
00:54:03,607 --> 00:54:05,973
Everyone has a father, Arthur.

542
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:07,634
- I don't.
- Yes, you do.

543
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:10,736
You just never met him, all right? Okay?

544
00:54:12,148 --> 00:54:13,342
Okay.

545
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:17,414
Kat, what about the VHS tapes?

546
00:54:17,487 --> 00:54:21,150
Okay. I heard you
for the umpteenth, gazillionth time, Arthur.

547
00:54:39,976 --> 00:54:43,969
Here you go, Champ.
90 minutes extend-o-play.

548
00:54:48,385 --> 00:54:49,511
What?

549
00:54:49,819 --> 00:54:54,381
What’s with the face? You have any idea
how hard it is to find VHS these days?

550
00:54:54,491 --> 00:54:57,392
Look, this whole box cost me three bucks.

551
00:54:59,362 --> 00:55:03,696
Look, you take some tape,
you tape over the thing.

552
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:07,793
Look, record right over that shit,
you're good to go.

553
00:55:18,081 --> 00:55:22,211
- I thought you said you stopped.
- Did l? I thought you said that.

554
00:55:22,852 --> 00:55:26,049
Listen, we've got to talk about
our little arrangement here.

555
00:55:26,523 --> 00:55:28,150
I have a check.

556
00:55:28,892 --> 00:55:31,019
No money, no honey, right?

557
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:36,598
Well, you spend all of my money on drugs.

558
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:39,032
Yeah, and...?

559
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:44,774
Well, you should spend it
on a typewriter, like Lois Lane.

560
00:55:44,874 --> 00:55:48,435
Well, guess what? I'm not Lois Lane,
and you're not fucking Superman.

561
00:55:48,545 --> 00:55:51,844
So go jack off to some other fantasy,
all right?

562
00:55:57,387 --> 00:55:59,218
I'm trying to help you.

563
00:55:59,289 --> 00:56:00,950
Go fuck yourself!

564
00:56:03,893 --> 00:56:06,862
Shit! Go fuck yourself, hero boy!

565
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:21,235
Donkey. D-O-N-K-Y.

566
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:30,742
I should warn you.
I'm in a really, really bad mood.

567
00:56:38,962 --> 00:56:40,088
Wait, wait, wait!

568
00:57:16,332 --> 00:57:19,301
You're in way over your head.
Now stay down.

569
00:57:24,374 --> 00:57:26,103
I said stay down!

570
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:40,483
Here. Hold this.

571
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:07,180
Be a man!

572
00:58:08,017 --> 00:58:09,541
What was that?

573
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:13,215
Guns are for cowards.

574
00:58:14,724 --> 00:58:16,316
Hold this, too.

575
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:22,521
- Arthur?
- Give me your best shot

576
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:24,590
- before my backup arrives.
- Arthur, can you hear me?

577
00:58:24,701 --> 00:58:27,169
Where are you? Arthur?

578
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:33,601
Arthur! Arthur!

579
00:58:35,445 --> 00:58:37,743
Arthur? Arthur!

580
00:59:10,113 --> 00:59:11,705
Where's Arthur?

581
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:14,547
Hey! Where is he?

582
00:59:14,984 --> 00:59:16,815
- What?
- Where is he?

583
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:19,281
- Is he okay?
- Where is Arthur?

584
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:20,788
Listen, girl, I don't know who you are,

585
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:24,553
but if you have any idea where he is,
you better tell me right now.

586
00:59:24,961 --> 00:59:26,895
He went to make a movie.

587
00:59:26,963 --> 00:59:28,055
A what?

588
00:59:28,131 --> 00:59:29,291
A movie.

589
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:30,798
You're gonna show me. Right now.

590
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,299
- Let's go.
- All right!

591
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:38,737
Oh, God!

592
00:59:46,482 --> 00:59:47,949
Were you scared, Arthur?

593
00:59:48,017 --> 00:59:50,110
Scared? No.

594
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:53,085
You could have died.

595
00:59:55,091 --> 01:00:00,358
Sometimes when I get really hurt,
I go to a nice place.

596
01:00:00,463 --> 01:00:02,931
Oh, can you explain that?

597
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:08,863
In my mind, I go to a nice place.
Like a memory.

598
01:00:08,972 --> 01:00:13,773
And I stay there until I feel better again.

599
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:26,812
Well, you like them, eh?

600
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:30,725
What’s that one say?

601
01:00:30,827 --> 01:00:32,522
G-l...

602
01:00:33,396 --> 01:00:36,832
Joe, dummy, G.I. Joe!

603
01:00:38,501 --> 01:00:40,833
It's time you learned to read.

604
01:00:49,512 --> 01:00:51,139
What were you thinking?

605
01:00:52,015 --> 01:00:53,710
- I'm his friend, all right?
- Yeah, I got it.

606
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:56,876
You know what? I really fucking doubt that.

607
01:00:56,986 --> 01:00:59,250
If he... Hey, look at me.

608
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:04,221
If he survives this, I want you to stay
the hell away from him. You got it?

609
01:01:05,361 --> 01:01:09,263
He's going to be okay. He was shot
several times with a training bullet.

610
01:01:09,365 --> 01:01:13,096
Like a small paint ball.
Now, he's got some nasty welts there.

611
01:01:13,202 --> 01:01:17,104
He's a mess across the board,
but he's going to pull through just fine.

612
01:01:45,735 --> 01:01:46,895
Hey.

613
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:52,371
You keep getting shit-kicked.

614
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:58,378
You got to not do that. What kind
of superhero gets beat up all the time?

615
01:02:08,091 --> 01:02:10,719
Remember when you asked me
what I'm good at?

616
01:02:13,129 --> 01:02:16,098
I think I'm good at running away.

617
01:02:19,669 --> 01:02:22,297
So I'm going to leave you alone now.

618
01:02:28,111 --> 01:02:30,636
This whole Captain Industry thing,

619
01:02:31,981 --> 01:02:33,744
it's too big for us.

620
01:02:34,183 --> 01:02:36,617
We should leave it for the cops.

621
01:02:40,623 --> 01:02:45,117
I mean, there are lots of pervs out there.
Trust me.

622
01:02:49,365 --> 01:02:52,664
You want to get your ya-yas out,
go after my dad.

623
01:02:53,836 --> 01:02:55,963
He macks on kids, you know.

624
01:02:57,874 --> 01:02:59,535
He macked on me.

625
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:26,295
Just get better.

626
01:03:41,918 --> 01:03:43,715
- Yeah?
- We got a problem.

627
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:46,584
Retard's alive, and your man's a cop.

628
01:03:46,689 --> 01:03:50,056
Yeah, I understand. I'll take...
I'll take care of it.

629
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:52,855
You take care of the rest, all right?

630
01:03:52,929 --> 01:03:54,260
All right.

631
01:03:58,434 --> 01:04:03,337
Hey. Give me your... Give me your MP-5.
Your gun. Yeah. That's it.

632
01:04:11,881 --> 01:04:13,746
Knock-knock. Police. Anybody there?

633
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:17,175
Simulated ammunition. Police issue?

634
01:04:18,921 --> 01:04:21,890
Hi, there. There's been some complaints
from the neighbors.

635
01:04:36,606 --> 01:04:39,234
Here. The fly's room number.

636
01:04:40,243 --> 01:04:41,608
Finish him.

637
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:44,778
Finish him!

638
01:05:38,167 --> 01:05:41,534
He was a bad man.

639
01:05:43,372 --> 01:05:45,806
- Yes, but...
- He wanted to be punished.

640
01:05:45,875 --> 01:05:49,003
His... His eyes told me.

641
01:05:53,516 --> 01:05:57,316
I was helping him to feel bad,

642
01:05:57,386 --> 01:06:01,789
so that he could feel bad
about what he did to Kat.

643
01:06:06,362 --> 01:06:10,128
He knew he was garbage.
He wanted to go in there.

644
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:13,032
I... I barely did anything.

645
01:06:15,338 --> 01:06:17,568
You don't... You don't think
you've done anything wrong?

646
01:06:17,673 --> 01:06:19,231
No, I do.

647
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:25,503
Captain Industry should be behind bars,
but now I'm here.

648
01:06:25,581 --> 01:06:29,745
Arthur, why is it so important
that you capture Captain Industry?

649
01:06:33,923 --> 01:06:35,754
He killed my mother.

650
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:47,362
When will I see Mommy again?

651
01:06:48,404 --> 01:06:51,840
You won't.
How many times do I have to say it?

652
01:06:52,541 --> 01:06:55,510
Could you hold that still, please,
or I'll bash you.

653
01:06:56,912 --> 01:06:58,106
Why?

654
01:06:59,048 --> 01:07:00,208
Drugs.

655
01:07:01,083 --> 01:07:02,380
The drugs did her in.

656
01:07:02,451 --> 01:07:05,352
I hate the drugs.
I hate the people who do the drugs.

657
01:07:05,421 --> 01:07:09,050
Hate the pushers, kid. They're the bad guys.

658
01:07:10,226 --> 01:07:12,057
Who are the pushers?

659
01:07:12,361 --> 01:07:15,057
The scum whose freedom I fought for.

660
01:07:17,633 --> 01:07:19,464
Captains of Industry.

661
01:07:25,975 --> 01:07:29,570
Captain Industry gave her drugs
and they killed her.

662
01:07:32,081 --> 01:07:37,542
As long as he is free,
other mothers are in danger.

663
01:07:44,593 --> 01:07:48,654
Your Honor, Mr. Poppington
is refusing representation.

664
01:07:48,764 --> 01:07:49,992
Reason?

665
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:55,504
He won't say, Your Honor. It's a...
It's a secret.

666
01:07:56,505 --> 01:08:01,135
Do you intend to represent yourself,
Mr. Poppington of no fixed address?

667
01:08:02,678 --> 01:08:04,145
He deserved it.

668
01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:05,838
That sounds like
an admission of guilt, Counselor.

669
01:08:05,948 --> 01:08:09,611
I do think, Your Honor, that there is
a question of intellectual capacity here.

670
01:08:09,685 --> 01:08:13,246
You stuck Mr. Debrofkowitz
into a garbage can.

671
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:16,585
Inventive. Do you know why you're here,
Mr. Poppington?

672
01:08:16,659 --> 01:08:19,924
- He wanted to go...
- Speak into the mike, please.

673
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:22,189
He...

674
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:32,263
He wanted to go in there. He... He...

675
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:36,105
He wanted to go in the garbage can.

676
01:08:36,178 --> 01:08:37,611
Your Honor,

677
01:08:39,515 --> 01:08:42,006
I've known this man for five years.

678
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:46,350
He worked for me. He's a good worker, sir.
He's just... He's a little slow.

679
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:49,049
He's not quite all there upstairs.

680
01:08:49,158 --> 01:08:50,523
And, sir, what is your name?

681
01:08:50,626 --> 01:08:53,356
Paul. Paul Carter.

682
01:08:53,662 --> 01:08:57,154
"Not quite all there upstairs."
Is this a clinical diagnosis?

683
01:08:57,666 --> 01:08:59,691
- No, sir.
- You're not a psychiatrist?

684
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:03,203
No. I'm a foreman for the city's
Public Works Department.

685
01:09:03,305 --> 01:09:05,296
Local 873. I'm his friend.

686
01:09:05,374 --> 01:09:07,035
Well, imagine if we all had friends like you.

687
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:09,634
God, he thinks he's a superhero!

688
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,905
That's why he's all beat up like that.

689
01:09:13,015 --> 01:09:15,882
He dresses up in tights
and he calls himself Defendor,

690
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:18,647
with a big "D" on his chest and a cape.

691
01:09:19,021 --> 01:09:24,186
No. Capes are for flying. I don't... I don't fly.

692
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:25,987
Quiet!

693
01:09:26,262 --> 01:09:28,321
Mr. Poppington, you are remanded

694
01:09:28,397 --> 01:09:32,231
until you have undergone
a full psychological evaluation.

695
01:09:32,334 --> 01:09:33,995
Do you understand what that means?

696
01:09:34,069 --> 01:09:35,661
No, he doesn't.

697
01:09:35,738 --> 01:09:38,730
I'd like to follow this one, counselors,
if there are no objections.

698
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:41,366
Yeah, I have no problem with that,
Your Honor.

699
01:09:41,911 --> 01:09:43,071
Next.

700
01:10:00,896 --> 01:10:05,629
Mr. Carter. Hi.
I'm Dominique Ball with The Spectator.

701
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:08,295
Look, I was really touched
by your testimony in there,

702
01:10:08,404 --> 01:10:10,736
and I was wondering
if you have anything to add.

703
01:10:10,806 --> 01:10:11,932
Maybe help me flesh out the story.

704
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:13,440
No. I've already done enough. Sorry.

705
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:18,912
No, Mr. Carter, listen. This could really help
sway public opinion in Arthur's favor.

706
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:25,712
Damn idiot!

707
01:10:32,628 --> 01:10:36,496
I'm sorry, is it lunch, guys? Let's go.
Get to work.

708
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:50,307
The question is, this guy, this lunatic,
is he good for the Hammer?

709
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:54,613
You know what I say?
If we're going to live in a frontier town,

710
01:10:54,683 --> 01:10:58,619
maybe it's time for a desperado
who's a little out there.

711
01:10:59,021 --> 01:11:02,787
All right. The switchboard's lighting up,
so let's go to the phones.

712
01:11:02,858 --> 01:11:04,587
First caller, you're on the air.

713
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:08,187
I love this guy. Finally someone is
stepping up and actually doing something.

714
01:11:08,297 --> 01:11:12,427
Okay. So you're with me. You like the guy.
Next caller.

715
01:11:12,768 --> 01:11:15,032
Defendor, yea or nay?

716
01:11:15,137 --> 01:11:17,765
Yea. Totally. He's got to be a little bit stupid

717
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,330
to do what he's doing,
you know what I'm saying?

718
01:11:19,441 --> 01:11:21,932
But I love him, I absolutely love him.

719
01:11:58,147 --> 01:12:01,480
All right, Arthur.
Anything else you'd like to add?

720
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:04,246
Two plus two. Four plus four. Six plus six.

721
01:12:04,353 --> 01:12:07,652
Anything else you think
I should put in my report?

722
01:12:11,727 --> 01:12:12,853
No.

723
01:12:14,263 --> 01:12:17,699
Thank you for being honest
and forthright with me.

724
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:19,492
You're welcome.

725
01:12:21,036 --> 01:12:22,230
Okay.

726
01:12:26,275 --> 01:12:32,236
Doctor? When I put Kat's dad
into the garbage.

727
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:33,838
Was that wrong?

728
01:12:34,683 --> 01:12:38,016
There are probably better ways
to deal with people like that.

729
01:12:38,854 --> 01:12:40,515
So it was wrong?

730
01:12:43,225 --> 01:12:45,090
I'm not sure, Arthur.

731
01:13:07,249 --> 01:13:11,276
FAS, ADD, depression,
delusional megalomania,

732
01:13:11,387 --> 01:13:15,721
unable to anticipate consequences,
serious lack of common sense,

733
01:13:15,791 --> 01:13:17,554
socially immature.

734
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:19,751
Sounds like me.

735
01:13:22,965 --> 01:13:24,728
I can't put him on the street, Ellen.

736
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:25,892
What?

737
01:13:26,602 --> 01:13:29,503
Judge, Arthur has been ostracized
his entire life.

738
01:13:29,605 --> 01:13:34,099
This... This persona, this Defendor
character, is a way of escaping that.

739
01:13:34,176 --> 01:13:36,667
He can be a perfectly
functioning member of society.

740
01:13:36,779 --> 01:13:39,270
- He needs guidance.
- An 18-month sting completely scuttled.

741
01:13:39,348 --> 01:13:41,908
Captain's whole investigation lost.

742
01:13:43,318 --> 01:13:46,082
Find a way, Judge. He won't survive inside.

743
01:13:46,588 --> 01:13:48,681
Find a way to keep him out of jail.

744
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:00,295
Arthur, would you take a seat, please?

745
01:14:02,371 --> 01:14:06,102
Now, Arthur, this judgment has been
accepted by all parties and Mr. Carter,

746
01:14:06,175 --> 01:14:09,838
who has very thoughtfully agreed
to be your guarantor and custodian.

747
01:14:09,945 --> 01:14:13,813
And from this day forth,
you will live with Mr. Carter and his family.

748
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:18,547
More importantly, you are to cease
and desist all acts of vigilantism.

749
01:14:18,654 --> 01:14:22,681
And you are forbidden to don the guise
of the Defendor, his likeness...

750
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:23,985
No! No!

751
01:14:24,059 --> 01:14:25,287
- Arthur, come on.
- No!

752
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:28,158
- Come on.
- No, no, no, no!

753
01:14:30,332 --> 01:14:32,892
Mr. Carter,
I have serious reservations about this!

754
01:14:33,001 --> 01:14:35,902
Your Honor, please,
just give me a second with him.

755
01:14:37,005 --> 01:14:38,563
Arthur? Listen to me.

756
01:14:38,674 --> 01:14:41,507
Where do I get
one of those shock machines?

757
01:14:41,577 --> 01:14:43,010
Arthur, it's over.

758
01:14:43,078 --> 01:14:45,808
Defendor's over.
You can't be Defendor anymore.

759
01:14:45,881 --> 01:14:47,644
But I didn't do anything.

760
01:14:47,716 --> 01:14:51,083
Some guys got hurt.
People, they think it's your fault.

761
01:14:53,088 --> 01:14:55,682
If you don't come home with me,
you're going to go to prison.

762
01:14:55,757 --> 01:14:57,315
You want that?

763
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:02,587
Come home with me. Okay?
Just come home.

764
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:35,757
Up against the wall.
I said up against the fucking wall!

765
01:15:36,231 --> 01:15:39,428
Don't make me tell you again!
Empty your pockets!

766
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:42,095
Everything out of your pockets. Come on.
What have you got here, honey?

767
01:15:42,204 --> 01:15:43,694
- Nothing!
- Come on.

768
01:15:43,772 --> 01:15:47,299
All right, go, go, go. Go!
Watch, don't step on the shit!

769
01:15:57,052 --> 01:15:58,280
Dooney!

770
01:16:01,657 --> 01:16:03,147
Oh, well, well.

771
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:07,085
So where have you been?

772
01:16:07,162 --> 01:16:08,459
Nowhere.

773
01:16:09,831 --> 01:16:13,426
- I want to come back.
- Now why should I take you back?

774
01:16:14,303 --> 01:16:16,464
After what your friend did to me.

775
01:16:16,572 --> 01:16:19,473
He's not my friend. I never even met the guy.

776
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:22,635
He's not your friend?
You read the papers, don't you?

777
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:27,075
Not your friend.
He stuffed your daddy in a garbage can.

778
01:16:27,616 --> 01:16:30,084
Where is he? How much does he know?

779
01:16:31,186 --> 01:16:32,619
I don't know.

780
01:16:38,293 --> 01:16:40,090
I still don't know.

781
01:16:46,301 --> 01:16:47,495
Get in.

782
01:16:50,539 --> 01:16:53,201
Just like old times. Huh?

783
01:16:58,981 --> 01:17:01,040
We could always take him out.

784
01:17:01,149 --> 01:17:04,846
No. No. Let's not paint a big,

785
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:08,155
flashing neon bull's-eye on us.

786
01:17:08,690 --> 01:17:11,215
We have to be on our best behavior.

787
01:17:13,095 --> 01:17:15,859
Then, when the container comes in,

788
01:17:16,932 --> 01:17:20,026
then we will swat the fly
and he will be dead.

789
01:17:21,503 --> 01:17:24,995
- One week.
- Dooney's right. What if he talks?

790
01:17:34,516 --> 01:17:38,043
Heads up, superhero. A little present for you.

791
01:18:04,613 --> 01:18:08,811
You don't say anything anymore, Arthur.
Is that because you're sad?

792
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:14,487
Are you sad
because you're living here now?

793
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:21,127
Is it because you can't be
a Defendor anymore?

794
01:18:24,766 --> 01:18:27,257
Are you ever going to speak again?

795
01:18:28,670 --> 01:18:31,798
Jack, honey, come on in
and get ready for bed.

796
01:18:38,113 --> 01:18:42,277
Well, if you change your mind,
you can at least talk to me, okay?

797
01:19:02,671 --> 01:19:06,300
It's raining out, Arthur.
Why don't you come in and get dry?

798
01:19:13,515 --> 01:19:15,107
It's a poncho.

799
01:19:17,285 --> 01:19:19,947
I want you to sleep indoors tonight.

800
01:19:22,157 --> 01:19:25,388
And I'm not asking you, Arthur.
I'm telling you.

801
01:19:43,245 --> 01:19:45,679
Do you remember
when you saved Jack's life?

802
01:19:48,583 --> 01:19:51,051
I'll never forget what you did that day.

803
01:19:54,322 --> 01:19:57,519
You were just a regular guy
doing something remarkable.

804
01:20:02,397 --> 01:20:04,490
You don't need a costume.

805
01:20:05,367 --> 01:20:08,768
Ordinary people,
they do extraordinary things all the time.

806
01:20:11,173 --> 01:20:15,200
You're always going to be that hero, Arthur,
just by being yourself.

807
01:20:31,259 --> 01:20:33,750
Keep back, Jose, or I'll kick your ass!

808
01:20:34,863 --> 01:20:39,266
What’s my name? Glad you asked.
Defendor, greaseball.

809
01:20:39,367 --> 01:20:40,959
Defendor.

810
01:20:48,043 --> 01:20:49,237
No.

811
01:20:50,478 --> 01:20:52,070
I'm Defendor.

812
01:21:26,314 --> 01:21:29,806
It's just for a few more days,
and then you'll be back to work.

813
01:21:29,918 --> 01:21:32,284
And it'll be business as usual, okay?

814
01:21:33,188 --> 01:21:35,122
Oh, joy. I can't wait.

815
01:21:36,992 --> 01:21:38,323
You hungry?

816
01:21:40,528 --> 01:21:41,756
No?

817
01:21:42,964 --> 01:21:44,625
Not hungry, huh?

818
01:21:45,834 --> 01:21:47,699
I'll just put it up here.

819
01:21:49,004 --> 01:21:50,301
All right.

820
01:21:54,976 --> 01:21:56,637
Let's make love then.

821
01:22:01,883 --> 01:22:04,351
Okay. Untie me.

822
01:22:07,689 --> 01:22:11,682
I kind of... I kind of like you
being tied up like a little pig.

823
01:22:13,828 --> 01:22:18,231
It pays to be nice sometimes.
Can I just fix my hair, please?

824
01:22:19,701 --> 01:22:21,464
Make myself pretty.

825
01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:34,541
Okay, I like that. Why not?

826
01:22:35,583 --> 01:22:38,051
Okay. You're a pretty pig.

827
01:22:49,497 --> 01:22:50,691
See?

828
01:22:51,833 --> 01:22:54,063
Nothing wrong with a little romance.

829
01:23:08,683 --> 01:23:10,514
Oink, oink, motherfucker.

830
01:23:16,024 --> 01:23:19,187
Arthur! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

831
01:23:24,632 --> 01:23:26,691
I was coming to rescue you.

832
01:23:26,768 --> 01:23:29,896
I shot him, Arthur!
I shot Dooney in the balls!

833
01:23:34,275 --> 01:23:36,209
Good girl.

834
01:23:44,919 --> 01:23:46,716
How did you know?

835
01:23:46,788 --> 01:23:49,655
"Container in three weeks."
That's what he said.

836
01:23:50,492 --> 01:23:55,657
Half-moon, then no moon,
plus one more half-moon, then full moon.

837
01:23:55,764 --> 01:23:57,789
Full moon equals three weeks.

838
01:24:01,102 --> 01:24:03,798
What the fuck are you...
What are you doing?

839
01:24:04,406 --> 01:24:06,840
I'm going to capture Captain Industry.

840
01:24:07,942 --> 01:24:10,968
Arthur, excuse me. They have guns.

841
01:24:12,147 --> 01:24:13,842
Guns don't hurt me.

842
01:24:14,849 --> 01:24:19,650
Really? So... So, what, I could just
shoot you right now and nothing happens?

843
01:24:23,625 --> 01:24:25,092
I lied, Arthur.

844
01:24:26,327 --> 01:24:29,194
Radovan Kristic is not Captain Industry.

845
01:24:30,932 --> 01:24:33,992
Not even close. I just said that because

846
01:24:34,102 --> 01:24:38,869
I thought you had a snowball's chance
in hell of doing anything about it.

847
01:24:38,973 --> 01:24:43,273
Because I wanted revenge, like you.
It was convenient for both of us. That's it.

848
01:24:45,947 --> 01:24:47,812
It's time for justice.

849
01:24:48,483 --> 01:24:52,647
I just shot that fagot cop, Arthur!
You don't think I can do it?

850
01:24:58,026 --> 01:25:00,893
Bullets don't hurt me. Go ahead.

851
01:25:02,197 --> 01:25:06,827
Squeeze the trigger. They bounce off.
They just bounce off. Go ahead.

852
01:25:30,825 --> 01:25:35,159
Here. You have five shots. Five shots, okay?

853
01:25:36,931 --> 01:25:40,389
- No, I don't like guns...
- Arthur, shut up! Take it! Take it!

854
01:25:40,502 --> 01:25:43,335
- I don't like...
- I'm not letting you leave unless you take it.

855
01:26:22,243 --> 01:26:23,437
What are you doing, son?

856
01:26:23,545 --> 01:26:27,447
Right now, a shipment of guns and girls
is arriving.

857
01:26:28,149 --> 01:26:32,813
Captain Industry will be there.
And maybe Sergeant Dooney.

858
01:26:32,921 --> 01:26:37,153
Although he got shot in the balls,
so maybe not.

859
01:26:37,992 --> 01:26:41,155
I'm going to get them, with or without you.

860
01:26:44,432 --> 01:26:45,558
Damn it!

861
01:26:45,633 --> 01:26:47,328
You know what I'm going to do right now?

862
01:26:47,435 --> 01:26:50,495
I'm going to get you a muffin
and a cup of coffee. Would you like that?

863
01:26:50,605 --> 01:26:52,800
Why don't you just hold your horses
right there?

864
01:26:52,907 --> 01:26:56,900
Hey, can I get a muffin
and a cup of coffee, pronto, please?

865
01:27:04,485 --> 01:27:08,649
Mike, I need you and your partner to
meet me in the parking lot five minutes ago.

866
01:27:08,756 --> 01:27:13,193
We got to check something out.
All right, and, Mike, just between us.

867
01:27:13,294 --> 01:27:15,125
- Do you follow?
- Got it.

868
01:27:15,196 --> 01:27:17,130
Hey, Defendor, I think...

869
01:27:31,546 --> 01:27:33,844
Oh, God, what have I done?

870
01:27:56,904 --> 01:27:58,804
En garde, gentlemen.

871
01:28:36,377 --> 01:28:39,210
Release swarm. Swarm, Dog. Swarm.

872
01:28:44,552 --> 01:28:45,576
Fuck!

873
01:28:46,688 --> 01:28:47,950
Fuck! Fuck!

874
01:28:59,267 --> 01:29:00,598
Incoming!

875
01:29:05,940 --> 01:29:09,376
Come on, Bob! Get up! Bob, get up!

876
01:29:22,957 --> 01:29:24,254
At last,

877
01:29:26,227 --> 01:29:27,421
the fly.

878
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:33,965
Guns are for...

879
01:29:58,359 --> 01:30:00,259
You killed my mother.

880
01:30:02,196 --> 01:30:03,959
Her name was Fay.

881
01:30:05,633 --> 01:30:06,759
Fay?

882
01:30:08,503 --> 01:30:10,528
Well, God forgives me.

883
01:30:12,673 --> 01:30:16,200
Goodbye, fly. Go in peace now.

884
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:27,317
What was the last name?

885
01:30:32,827 --> 01:30:33,885
What?

886
01:30:33,995 --> 01:30:35,485
Trench club.

887
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:17,530
This is Captain Fairbanks of the HPD.
Put down your weapons.

888
01:31:21,242 --> 01:31:25,440
Guns are for cowards.

889
01:31:25,546 --> 01:31:27,537
I know. I know they are.

890
01:31:37,358 --> 01:31:39,053
Don't do drugs.

891
01:31:39,126 --> 01:31:41,959
I'm not going to. I promise.
I promise I'm not going to.

892
01:31:42,063 --> 01:31:44,258
And get a job.

893
01:31:46,067 --> 01:31:49,298
I will. I'll get a real job.
And you're not going to die, you know.

894
01:31:49,403 --> 01:31:53,567
- You're just... You're going to be fine.
- Typewriter.

895
01:31:53,641 --> 01:31:57,941
Yeah, and be Lois Lane. I know.
I'm going to try really, really hard.

896
01:32:04,552 --> 01:32:06,144
I love you, Kat.

897
01:32:06,254 --> 01:32:07,949
I love you, too.

898
01:32:10,324 --> 01:32:13,316
- Moon...
- What? What are you saying?

899
01:32:17,598 --> 01:32:19,623
I'll see you on the moon.

900
01:32:22,436 --> 01:32:25,064
Okay. I'll see you on the moon.

901
01:32:26,307 --> 01:32:29,071
Oh, fuck... No...

902
01:32:55,136 --> 01:32:57,127
First caller, you're on the air.

903
01:32:57,204 --> 01:32:59,832
Finally, someone comes along
and says winning is possible.

904
01:32:59,941 --> 01:33:02,307
Right. And we don't have to be afraid.

905
01:33:02,376 --> 01:33:06,472
Right. Exactly. And what, this guy had an IQ
of like 80 or something, right?

906
01:33:06,547 --> 01:33:09,015
We're having a special service
for Defendor at our church...

907
01:33:09,116 --> 01:33:10,777
...take on those bikers and...

908
01:33:10,851 --> 01:33:12,318
It's classic. It's Defendor vs. Goliath...

909
01:33:12,386 --> 01:33:14,377
One word, thank you.

910
01:33:14,488 --> 01:33:15,978
...he didn't have a bullet-proof vest.

911
01:33:16,057 --> 01:33:18,890
If he had a vest,
he totally wouldn't have died.

912
01:33:18,993 --> 01:33:21,484
It's always nice to hear
from our younger listeners.

913
01:33:21,562 --> 01:33:22,722
Next caller. Go ahead.

914
01:33:22,830 --> 01:33:25,697
What does it say about us
when we're relying on individuals who

915
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:26,858
really should be admitted?

916
01:33:26,968 --> 01:33:29,835
I'm not taking anything away
from what Defendor did,

917
01:33:29,904 --> 01:33:31,872
- but I wouldn't be surprised...
- Did he have any next of kin?

918
01:33:31,973 --> 01:33:33,372
Line five. What's on your mind?

919
01:33:33,474 --> 01:33:36,307
I'm sort of at a loss for words,
but I think he's a real hero.
