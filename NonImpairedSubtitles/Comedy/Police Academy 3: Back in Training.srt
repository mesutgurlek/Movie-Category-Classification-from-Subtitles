1
00:01:22,513 --> 00:01:23,787
We close in 20 minutes.

2
00:01:42,433 --> 00:01:43,468
Damn!

3
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:47,622
Thanks.

4
00:02:05,873 --> 00:02:09,468
-Where the hell are these clowns?
-It is a large garage, sir.

5
00:02:10,233 --> 00:02:13,862
-We're over here!
-Are you an idiot?

6
00:02:17,753 --> 00:02:19,232
There they are.

7
00:02:19,393 --> 00:02:20,712
Get down.

8
00:02:23,193 --> 00:02:24,512
It's about time.

9
00:02:24,593 --> 00:02:27,312
I've sucked up enough fumes
to last me a lifetime.

10
00:02:27,393 --> 00:02:28,587
Stand up!

11
00:02:29,153 --> 00:02:31,462
What's with all this deep-throat crap?

12
00:02:31,553 --> 00:02:34,863
Don't look at me. It wasn't my idea
to meet here. It was his.

13
00:02:34,953 --> 00:02:36,864
We shouldn't be seen together.

14
00:02:36,993 --> 00:02:40,668
Just thinking of the safety factor
of Operation Fiasco.

15
00:02:41,473 --> 00:02:43,623
That's what I call this, sir.

16
00:02:43,873 --> 00:02:46,103
I work with the village idiot.

17
00:02:46,193 --> 00:02:49,151
-Do you guys have any idea--
-Sir, your glasses!

18
00:02:52,033 --> 00:02:55,742
Do you guys.... Take off your glasses.

19
00:02:56,673 --> 00:03:00,461
Do you guys have any idea how many
police academies are in this state?

20
00:03:00,753 --> 00:03:04,871
-Is this a trick question, sir?
-No, this is not a trick question, sir.

21
00:03:05,153 --> 00:03:06,745
-Two.
-Wrong.

22
00:03:07,273 --> 00:03:10,902
My sources have informed me that
one of them is about to be terminated.

23
00:03:10,993 --> 00:03:12,904
-Which one?
-I don't know.

24
00:03:13,353 --> 00:03:15,264
They haven't decided yet.

25
00:03:15,873 --> 00:03:17,829
And that's where you two come in.

26
00:03:17,913 --> 00:03:22,065
I need two good men that'll make sure
Lassard's academy fails and not mine.

27
00:03:22,673 --> 00:03:25,710
I need two good men
that'll inform on Lassard's academy...

28
00:03:25,793 --> 00:03:27,784
and tell me every move they make.

29
00:03:27,873 --> 00:03:31,661
I need two good men
that'll sell out their mothers to get ahead.

30
00:03:32,273 --> 00:03:34,548
-That's us.
-Good.

31
00:03:36,033 --> 00:03:37,466
Can we go now?

32
00:03:38,513 --> 00:03:40,151
We should split up.

33
00:03:40,273 --> 00:03:42,912
Safety factor. We'll go first.

34
00:03:54,433 --> 00:03:56,469
Looks like it's closed, sir.

35
00:04:02,353 --> 00:04:03,945
They locked us in.

36
00:04:11,713 --> 00:04:13,465
The car!

37
00:04:17,993 --> 00:04:19,551
No problem, sir!

38
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:21,626
I got it! Please!

39
00:04:21,713 --> 00:04:23,544
-My car!
-Please, stop!

40
00:04:32,913 --> 00:04:34,062
My car.

41
00:04:56,193 --> 00:04:58,343
<i>As governor of this great state of ours...</i>

42
00:04:58,433 --> 00:05:02,028
<i>it fills me with pride</i>
<i>to see these graduating police cadets.</i>

43
00:05:03,033 --> 00:05:05,024
<i>I'm also sad to tell you...</i>

44
00:05:05,113 --> 00:05:08,423
<i>that this is the last time</i>
<i>we will be graduating two classes.</i>

45
00:05:09,113 --> 00:05:10,148
What?

46
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:14,909
<i>It's time to tighten our belts.</i>
<i>It's time to close one of the academies.</i>

47
00:05:15,553 --> 00:05:19,990
<i>But in the spirit of fair play, which is</i>
<i>the hallmark of my administration...</i>

48
00:05:20,073 --> 00:05:21,984
<i>I have appointed a committee...</i>

49
00:05:22,433 --> 00:05:25,391
<i>to evaluate and compare</i>
<i>the two academies.</i>

50
00:05:25,633 --> 00:05:28,670
<i>That way, their fate will rest</i>
<i>in their own hands.</i>

51
00:05:28,873 --> 00:05:32,707
<i>I am certain that both commandants</i>
<i>will welcome such a challenge.</i>

52
00:05:34,273 --> 00:05:35,228
Got it!

53
00:05:35,313 --> 00:05:39,272
<i>Isn't that true, Comdt. Mauser</i>
<i>and Comdt. Lassard?</i>

54
00:05:49,153 --> 00:05:52,350
Well, Comdt. Lassard, good luck, sir.

55
00:05:54,273 --> 00:05:57,629
-May the better academy win.
-We intend to, sir.

56
00:05:57,873 --> 00:06:00,148
Don't be too sure, Comdt. Mauser.

57
00:06:00,233 --> 00:06:04,590
We have many wonderful new recruits
which we shall mold in my own image.

58
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:07,427
Promise me you'll do that, sir, please.

59
00:06:07,513 --> 00:06:09,583
Sir, the committee.

60
00:06:11,393 --> 00:06:15,181
Ladies, gentlemen, truly a pleasure.

61
00:06:15,273 --> 00:06:18,743
Anyone need a ride, police escort?
Don't hesitate to ask.

62
00:06:20,393 --> 00:06:22,953
Governor, magnificent speech!

63
00:06:23,393 --> 00:06:26,112
Bravo! I applaud you.

64
00:06:31,273 --> 00:06:32,991
Why beat around the bush, Mauser?

65
00:06:33,073 --> 00:06:35,382
Just get down on your knees
and kiss his ass.

66
00:06:35,473 --> 00:06:38,590
I don't need any tactical advice
from you, Callahan.

67
00:06:38,953 --> 00:06:40,147
Governor!

68
00:06:41,753 --> 00:06:44,950
I know you're a busy man, sir,
but I've been doing a study...

69
00:06:45,033 --> 00:06:47,672
on some training techniques
I thought might interest you.

70
00:06:47,753 --> 00:06:50,313
The Governor is in a hurry,
Comdt. Mauser.

71
00:06:50,393 --> 00:06:52,702
I could memo you on these, sir.

72
00:06:54,033 --> 00:06:56,024
Governor, I speak for everyone
when I say--

73
00:06:59,073 --> 00:07:00,392
Let me assure you, Governor...

74
00:07:00,473 --> 00:07:02,828
Comdt. Mauser
does not speak for this academy.

75
00:07:02,913 --> 00:07:04,505
Governor, what I meant to say was--

76
00:07:09,473 --> 00:07:13,386
Get a hold of yourself, you idiot.
You're making the Governor sick!

77
00:07:15,313 --> 00:07:17,907
You certainly made
a lasting impression on the Governor.

78
00:07:17,993 --> 00:07:21,269
The only impression that counts, sir,
is in this file!

79
00:07:22,113 --> 00:07:24,832
We'll see who's got an academy
when this is over.

80
00:07:24,913 --> 00:07:25,948
Proctor!

81
00:07:29,513 --> 00:07:33,791
-You have nothing to worry about, sir.
-Right. Just leave everything to us.

82
00:07:34,473 --> 00:07:37,590
We'll make Mauser eat those words.
Let's go.

83
00:07:38,993 --> 00:07:40,824
-Mahoney.
-Right.

84
00:07:41,553 --> 00:07:44,465
Okay, come on now. Guys!

85
00:07:45,633 --> 00:07:48,864
Girls, of course, I'm sorry.
All right, keep it up! Number one!

86
00:07:48,953 --> 00:07:52,628
Take it on, drive it in here! Keep it alive.
Take it in, drive in!

87
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:55,222
Keep your arms up! Take it! Take it on....

88
00:07:55,313 --> 00:07:57,622
Try! Bring it back. Stop. Stop the playing!

89
00:07:57,713 --> 00:08:01,672
Give me the ball. Gather around, girls.
I want to talk about something.

90
00:08:01,753 --> 00:08:03,709
I want you to remember from yesterday....

91
00:08:03,793 --> 00:08:06,068
Come a little closer. All right.

92
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:09,463
Remember from yesterday,
you pick and roll? Now, ready and break!

93
00:08:09,553 --> 00:08:10,781
Number two. Keep it alive.

94
00:08:10,873 --> 00:08:13,990
<i>Police Academy to Sgt. Mahoney.</i>
<i>Come in, please.</i>

95
00:08:14,073 --> 00:08:15,665
Sgt. Mahoney's office.

96
00:08:15,753 --> 00:08:18,870
<i>Get me Mahoney,</i>
<i>and get your feet off the dashboard!</i>

97
00:08:21,193 --> 00:08:22,831
Good, take it along now.

98
00:08:23,393 --> 00:08:26,783
-I'm sorry, Sergeant. I didn't mean to.
-That's okay. My pleasure.

99
00:08:26,993 --> 00:08:30,906
Sgt. Mahoney, I just heard,
Comdt. Lassard needs help.

100
00:08:31,193 --> 00:08:32,911
Lassard's in trouble?

101
00:08:33,193 --> 00:08:34,421
Give it back!

102
00:08:37,313 --> 00:08:38,712
Wait. Wait for me!

103
00:08:38,913 --> 00:08:39,868
Go, Mom!

104
00:08:46,273 --> 00:08:47,991
<i>Sgt. Hightower, come in.</i>

105
00:08:48,353 --> 00:08:49,263
Shit.

106
00:08:49,353 --> 00:08:52,868
<i>Hightower, get rid of the pantyhose</i>
<i>and report to the academy immediately.</i>

107
00:08:52,953 --> 00:08:54,181
I'm on my way.

108
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:56,148
Eugene?

109
00:08:58,633 --> 00:09:00,066
Tackleberry?

110
00:09:03,713 --> 00:09:05,988
Come on out, Eugene. I give up.

111
00:09:06,753 --> 00:09:08,869
You outdid yourself this time.

112
00:09:09,673 --> 00:09:11,231
Olly, olly, oxen free?

113
00:09:14,273 --> 00:09:16,662
All right, come on, Tackleberry,
I'm tired of this.

114
00:09:16,753 --> 00:09:18,903
Quit fooling around in the backyard.

115
00:09:20,633 --> 00:09:23,067
I'm serious. I got something to tell you.

116
00:09:24,473 --> 00:09:27,829
All right, come on, Eugene.
I'm getting pretty tired of this.

117
00:09:28,033 --> 00:09:30,593
Come on, Eugene,
I got an important message--

118
00:09:30,673 --> 00:09:32,789
Good one, Tack. Really fooled me.

119
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:35,546
Mahoney called.
He said Lassard needs help.

120
00:09:53,553 --> 00:09:57,546
What a wonderful moment,
my favorite graduates back.

121
00:09:58,193 --> 00:10:00,991
The academy is facing
its greatest challenge.

122
00:10:01,353 --> 00:10:03,105
After many years...

123
00:10:03,313 --> 00:10:07,704
of graduating many fine police officers,
the State says...

124
00:10:07,793 --> 00:10:10,591
it can no longer afford
two police academies.

125
00:10:10,753 --> 00:10:13,221
God knows what they did
with all the money.

126
00:10:14,953 --> 00:10:16,989
We have a tradition to uphold...

127
00:10:17,073 --> 00:10:19,792
a reputation to defend,
and defend it, we will!

128
00:10:23,353 --> 00:10:25,708
-Thank you, Mahoney.
-Anytime, sir.

129
00:10:26,473 --> 00:10:30,830
With our new recruits and your help,
I'm sure we can survive the competition.

130
00:10:31,873 --> 00:10:33,750
There can only be one winner.

131
00:10:35,873 --> 00:10:38,945
But also only one loser,
which works out nicely.

132
00:10:39,913 --> 00:10:41,710
I certainly hope we win.

133
00:10:41,793 --> 00:10:44,307
Then I can retire
with the same sense of dignity...

134
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,623
I have always brought to the academy.

135
00:10:48,913 --> 00:10:49,743
Dismissed.

136
00:10:50,633 --> 00:10:53,147
Get out of my way, buster,
or I'll start playing rough.

137
00:10:53,233 --> 00:10:54,552
-Don't do that.
-No, I will not!

138
00:10:54,633 --> 00:10:57,306
You have the stupidest idea.
Put down that suitcase.

139
00:10:57,393 --> 00:11:00,191
-You are not going to that police academy.
-Wrong!

140
00:11:02,153 --> 00:11:05,702
Finally, don't you think one policeman
in this family is enough?

141
00:11:05,793 --> 00:11:07,988
Stop it! I don't care what you say!

142
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:10,948
Great.

143
00:11:11,553 --> 00:11:15,432
Okay, listen. See, I just wanted
to join the force to be with you.

144
00:11:16,273 --> 00:11:19,743
I mean, we can ride together, we can wear
matching uniforms, share ammo...

145
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,949
everything that makes a marriage work.

146
00:11:22,033 --> 00:11:24,501
Honey, look. Listen to me, sweetheart.

147
00:11:25,513 --> 00:11:29,426
-Police work, it's just so dangerous.
-I don't care!

148
00:11:30,513 --> 00:11:32,071
Oh, no. No, you don't!

149
00:11:32,873 --> 00:11:35,512
You let go of me, mister,
or face the consequences!

150
00:11:35,593 --> 00:11:38,153
-Good morning, Facklers.
-Hello, Mrs. Pectelli.

151
00:11:38,233 --> 00:11:40,508
It is hell out there on those streets.

152
00:11:41,393 --> 00:11:43,953
-All right. Okay.
-Come on.

153
00:11:46,193 --> 00:11:47,706
Sweetie, what? Come on.

154
00:11:47,793 --> 00:11:50,785
We're adults.
I know we can talk this thing out.

155
00:11:50,873 --> 00:11:54,468
Exactly. I know you're smart enough
to do that work. It's just that...

156
00:11:54,553 --> 00:11:58,910
I'm the breadwinner in this family, and
you're my lady, and your place is at home.

157
00:11:58,993 --> 00:12:00,949
Right? Come on, give me a kiss.

158
00:12:01,473 --> 00:12:03,464
What do you.... Come on.

159
00:12:03,553 --> 00:12:06,590
You think I can't break this down?
Open it up, sweetie.

160
00:12:06,673 --> 00:12:09,870
I'm a policeman. I'm trained
for this kind of stuff, you know that?

161
00:12:09,953 --> 00:12:13,741
All right, big joke. Open that door!
Come on. You said we'd be adults.

162
00:12:17,193 --> 00:12:18,342
That's my....

163
00:12:24,473 --> 00:12:27,704
-Do you want to kill me?
-I have thought about it a couple of times.

164
00:12:27,793 --> 00:12:29,749
Honey, stop it right now! I'm serious!

165
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,063
I don't care.
I wanna go to the police academy.

166
00:12:32,153 --> 00:12:35,862
Listen to reason, will you? Listen to me
right now. You are not gonna....

167
00:12:35,953 --> 00:12:38,592
-What are you doing?
-I want you off this car now!

168
00:12:38,673 --> 00:12:41,426
I just waxed this car.
You'll get me into so much trouble.

169
00:12:43,593 --> 00:12:46,744
This is a city street,
not a drag strip, thank you.

170
00:12:50,113 --> 00:12:52,422
If you don't like it, you go around me!

171
00:12:56,513 --> 00:12:59,505

Porter. Redcap.

That's right.
Could you help me with these, please?

That's right. Come on over here.

Porter.

Please, sit down. Please.

185
00:14:33,793 --> 00:14:37,069
Zip your lips, slap your butts to the seat
and listen hard!

186
00:14:39,033 --> 00:14:40,466
That's a lot better.

191
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:54,312
And march them!

192
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:11,426
Who did that?

193
00:15:11,913 --> 00:15:15,701
Say, man, this place is crazy. Suckers
always making me dance and stuff.

194
00:15:15,793 --> 00:15:18,705
What kind of place is this?
I don't look like I'm gonna make it.

195
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:20,465
You'll make it just fine. Keep dancing.

196
00:15:28,393 --> 00:15:30,588
Good, tall. Good.

197
00:15:31,073 --> 00:15:32,472
Good, strong.

198
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:34,707
Excuse me.

199
00:15:36,433 --> 00:15:37,912
And who might you be?

200
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:41,908
Tomoko Nogata, of Tachikawa Nogatas.

201
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,149
"And is this your lovely wife?"

202
00:15:47,593 --> 00:15:48,992
-Proctor.
-Yes, sir.

203
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:52,224
-What's the story here with Fu Manchu?
-Fu Manchu.

204
00:15:52,753 --> 00:15:53,981
I don't have a Fu Manchu.

205
00:15:54,073 --> 00:15:56,633
I'm talking about the stir-fried shrimp
from out of town!

206
00:15:56,713 --> 00:15:58,544
He's with the Tachikawa Highway Patrol...

207
00:15:58,633 --> 00:16:01,830
part of an international exchange program,
here to study our methods.

208
00:16:01,913 --> 00:16:04,427
I'm not teaching my cadets
how to use a wok!

209
00:16:06,193 --> 00:16:09,663
You ship him off to Lassard's.
He'll fit in perfectly over there.

210
00:16:09,753 --> 00:16:12,711
He could use a good sushi chef.

211
00:16:13,553 --> 00:16:16,386
-No offense?
-Thank you.

212
00:16:16,553 --> 00:16:17,986
Kiss my what?

213
00:16:25,393 --> 00:16:27,031
Excuse me, sir.

214
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:30,304
-Ma'am! I'm a ma'am!
-I'm sorry.

215
00:16:30,553 --> 00:16:33,113
Those guns make it difficult to tell.

216
00:16:33,753 --> 00:16:35,823
-Are you an instructor?
-Affirmative.

217
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:37,107
Are you a new recruit?

218
00:16:37,193 --> 00:16:40,742
-Yes, I--
-She certainly is. But she's terribly shy.

219
00:16:41,113 --> 00:16:44,071
Stand up straight, Sarah.
And don't babble.

220
00:16:44,153 --> 00:16:46,064
What will the instructor think?

221
00:16:46,153 --> 00:16:48,269
-Now, just pay attention--
-Stifle it!

222
00:16:48,353 --> 00:16:50,662
Don't worry, Sarah.
When we're finished with you...

223
00:16:50,753 --> 00:16:53,108
you'll have nerves of steel,
ice in your veins...

224
00:16:53,193 --> 00:16:55,991
and a set of brass balls this big.

225
00:16:57,753 --> 00:16:59,391
No favoritism here, Eugene.

226
00:16:59,473 --> 00:17:02,271
Bud, here, he fouls up,
you give him a good whack.

227
00:17:03,953 --> 00:17:06,513
-Gotcha!
-That was a good one. Pretty sneaky.

228
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,865
Caught me off guard.

229
00:17:13,993 --> 00:17:17,269
You take care of yourself, son.
And pay attention to Eugene.

230
00:17:17,353 --> 00:17:20,265
I'm proud of you.
You're gonna make one hell of a cop.

231
00:17:20,353 --> 00:17:22,947
Thanks, Dad.
Would you give this to Mom for me?

232
00:17:24,353 --> 00:17:26,309
Don't forget to buckle up.

233
00:17:27,273 --> 00:17:28,991
That was a good one.

234
00:17:33,673 --> 00:17:34,628
Sorry!

235
00:17:35,753 --> 00:17:38,711
Boy, my dad and I have
a terrific relationship.

236
00:17:53,713 --> 00:17:57,547
Does anybody know how to shut
this thing off? It's driving me nuts!

237
00:17:58,473 --> 00:17:59,428
Thanks.

238
00:18:07,433 --> 00:18:09,185
Okay, that's $700.

239
00:18:10,313 --> 00:18:12,702
-Plus tip.
-Here you go.

240
00:18:13,713 --> 00:18:15,590
Wait a minute. What is this?

241
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:19,863
What do you think you're giving me here?
What, are you kidding?

242
00:18:19,953 --> 00:18:22,467
I don't take any money
with pictures of tuna fish on it.

243
00:18:22,553 --> 00:18:25,545
Come on, American money.
Let's go. $700, that's what you owe me.

244
00:18:25,633 --> 00:18:27,749
Wait a minute. Excuse me.
What's going on here?

245
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:31,143
-Not enough. He owes me $700, plus tip.
-$700 for a cab ride?

246
00:18:31,233 --> 00:18:34,111
-Where did you catch this cab, Yokohama?
-Yokohama.

247
00:18:37,513 --> 00:18:41,028
Excuse me. I'm Officer Carey Mahoney.
May I be of some assistance?

248
00:18:41,113 --> 00:18:43,832
-Yes. This guy is trying to rip off this guy.
-"Rip off."

249
00:18:43,913 --> 00:18:47,428
-Read the meter. The meter don't lie.
-Is this true? And who's your barber?

250
00:18:47,513 --> 00:18:50,027
Look, wise guy,
don't think a blue uniform scares me.

251
00:18:50,113 --> 00:18:53,344
-No, sir, this is not a scary uniform.
-No, it's not a scary uniform.

252
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:55,025
-Hightower!
-That's a scary uniform.

253
00:18:55,113 --> 00:18:57,183
This man just said something
about your mother.

254
00:18:57,273 --> 00:19:00,026
He also charged this guy $700
for a cab ride.

255
00:19:00,113 --> 00:19:02,707
-A rip-off.
-Meters don't lie. Read the meter.

256
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:07,744
They don't lie. They never lie.

257
00:19:09,353 --> 00:19:10,706
Meters don't lie.

258
00:19:11,593 --> 00:19:14,107
This meter lied. It's a lying meter.

259
00:19:17,033 --> 00:19:18,944
-Fair price.
-And tip.

260
00:19:19,153 --> 00:19:21,144
-What's your name, son?
-Nogata.

261
00:19:21,233 --> 00:19:22,951
-Nogata? New recruit?
-Yes.

262
00:19:23,033 --> 00:19:25,103
-Right over there.
-Thank you. Okay.

263
00:19:25,953 --> 00:19:28,228
-Thanks, Hightower.
-Okay, babe.

264
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:33,702
Excuse me.

265
00:19:33,793 --> 00:19:36,705
That sordid little scene
must have been trying on you, Miss....

266
00:19:36,793 --> 00:19:37,828
Karen Adams.

267
00:19:37,913 --> 00:19:41,667
You're Karen Adams?
You're kidding. We're roomies!

268
00:19:41,753 --> 00:19:44,392
I'll help you settle in.
You'll take your clothes off...

269
00:19:44,473 --> 00:19:46,145
-we'll shower, get close--
-I'm sorry.

270
00:19:46,233 --> 00:19:49,703
I'm not here to get hit on by every guy
who looks cute in a blue uniform.

271
00:19:49,793 --> 00:19:51,749
I want to be a policewoman.

272
00:19:51,913 --> 00:19:53,141
You will be!

273
00:19:53,513 --> 00:19:56,073
We'll get together. We'll talk! I hope.

274
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:03,430
Well, Mahoney,
I see you still have very good taste.

275
00:20:03,513 --> 00:20:04,229
Thank you.

276
00:20:19,473 --> 00:20:20,792
Nice bike!

277
00:20:22,393 --> 00:20:24,588
Where do you put the batteries?

278
00:20:26,953 --> 00:20:28,545
Get out of my way!

279
00:20:41,713 --> 00:20:43,032
That didn't hurt!

280
00:20:45,353 --> 00:20:47,264
Hi, was I going too fast?

281
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,351
Where do I go to register?

282
00:20:58,433 --> 00:21:01,345
-Let's go. Kirkland, 46!
-Yeah, all right.

283
00:21:01,433 --> 00:21:03,901
-Fackler, where do you think you're going?
-With him.

284
00:21:03,993 --> 00:21:05,949
-Women downstairs!
-Damn!

285
00:21:06,113 --> 00:21:08,547
Move it! Let's go. Come on now, girls!

286
00:21:08,633 --> 00:21:12,228
-Move it.
-All right, Sweetchuck, let's go.

287
00:21:27,393 --> 00:21:30,191
-What's your problem?
-He's the problem. He's an animal.

288
00:21:30,273 --> 00:21:32,389
Get used to it. He's your roommate.

289
00:21:33,033 --> 00:21:36,105
-Roommate?
-Zed's reformed. He's on our side now.

290
00:21:36,193 --> 00:21:39,822
Yeah. I used to be a real jerk,
but now I'm a people guy.

291
00:21:55,793 --> 00:21:57,146
You're awake!

292
00:21:57,233 --> 00:22:00,191
What kind of music do you like?
You like salsa? You like reggae?

293
00:22:00,273 --> 00:22:02,184
Something with that love beat?

294
00:22:02,513 --> 00:22:06,904
This is a song I wrote, off my first album.
And it goes something like this.

295
00:22:13,633 --> 00:22:17,421
It was originally a love ballad,
but I kind of spruced it up.

296
00:22:21,033 --> 00:22:23,706
No, I don't take requests.

297
00:22:25,073 --> 00:22:26,142
All right, clowns...

298
00:22:26,233 --> 00:22:29,464
I want you to police this entire area
from here to the parade ground.

299
00:22:29,553 --> 00:22:33,228
I want you to pick up every cigarette butt,
every scrap of paper, every weed.

300
00:22:33,313 --> 00:22:35,224
Now, we're gonna be watching
from my window.

301
00:22:35,313 --> 00:22:38,623
So if I see these flashlights stop moving,
you're both in big trouble.

302
00:22:38,713 --> 00:22:41,352
Big trouble. Now, get to work.

303
00:22:42,073 --> 00:22:43,552
Let's go, Chad.

304
00:22:58,633 --> 00:23:00,112
-Mr. Zed.
-No school.

305
00:23:02,513 --> 00:23:05,869
-Are you sure this is gonna work?
-Of course it's gonna work.

306
00:23:07,193 --> 00:23:08,546
It's working.

307
00:23:12,593 --> 00:23:15,630
Hup, two, three, four.

308
00:23:21,073 --> 00:23:24,463
As you can see, sir,
I have instant access over all my cadets...

309
00:23:24,553 --> 00:23:26,384
and all of the instructors.

310
00:23:26,633 --> 00:23:29,784
Attention! Give me 20 pushups, now!

311
00:23:32,233 --> 00:23:34,144
There's no escaping the camera's eye, sir.

312
00:23:34,233 --> 00:23:37,191
As you could see,
I can monitor the gym, the classrooms...

313
00:23:37,273 --> 00:23:38,786
<i>The Rocky & Bullwinkle Show?</i>

314
00:23:38,873 --> 00:23:42,263
Good! This is the episode where Natasha
and Boris have Rocky--

315
00:23:42,953 --> 00:23:45,023
It's an old one, though. I've seen it. Rerun.

316
00:23:45,113 --> 00:23:47,581
We have a few bugs
to be worked out, sir...

317
00:23:47,673 --> 00:23:49,982
but I'm sure
you'll tell the evaluation committee...

318
00:23:50,073 --> 00:23:52,223
about the wonderful work we're doing in--

319
00:23:52,313 --> 00:23:55,703
You're chapping your lips
on the wrong butt, Mr. Mauser.

320
00:23:56,233 --> 00:23:59,031
I have no say
with the evaluation committee.

321
00:23:59,593 --> 00:24:03,063
Besides, I want both academies
to look good.

322
00:24:03,153 --> 00:24:04,711
So do I, sir.

323
00:24:06,353 --> 00:24:09,231
And when may the committee
be coming by, sir?

324
00:24:09,953 --> 00:24:13,832
The committee is spending the rest
of the week at Lassard's academy.

325
00:24:13,913 --> 00:24:18,350
Next week, the Governor has them
snooping around the downtown precincts.

326
00:24:18,433 --> 00:24:20,105
So that gives you...

327
00:24:20,473 --> 00:24:23,385
a couple of weeks
to perfect your ass-kissing.

328
00:24:23,473 --> 00:24:25,509
That's plenty of time, sir.

329
00:24:29,313 --> 00:24:30,507
Callahan, there you are.

330
00:24:30,593 --> 00:24:33,426
We have to talk to you
about this evaluation thing.

331
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:35,185
I'll see you at my....

332
00:24:38,473 --> 00:24:42,386
And four! And one, and two, and three!

333
00:25:20,913 --> 00:25:24,064
Not only must you know all traffic laws...

334
00:25:24,153 --> 00:25:27,429
you must also master high-speed driving.

335
00:25:27,873 --> 00:25:31,582
Now, we'll begin today
with a leisurely spin around the course.

336
00:25:36,753 --> 00:25:38,903
Watch where you're going, lady!

337
00:25:50,993 --> 00:25:53,223
Okay, you can start the car now.

338
00:25:53,313 --> 00:25:56,066
But if I hear any of those things,
you've failed.

339
00:25:57,033 --> 00:25:59,149
Wrong key. I'll be right back.

340
00:26:00,193 --> 00:26:01,831
That's no problem.

341
00:26:11,913 --> 00:26:13,790
Very often in the field...

342
00:26:13,873 --> 00:26:16,068
the dog can be your best friend.

343
00:26:16,513 --> 00:26:18,071
Your most faithful partner.

344
00:26:18,153 --> 00:26:21,111
I love dogs, and they love me.
Hi, boy.

345
00:26:24,113 --> 00:26:25,910
First.... Out.

346
00:26:28,233 --> 00:26:29,302
Thanks.

347
00:26:29,393 --> 00:26:32,703
It is important to develop
the master-dog relationship.

348
00:26:33,153 --> 00:26:34,905
If you show any fear...

349
00:26:35,473 --> 00:26:37,589
the dog will not respect you.

350
00:26:38,593 --> 00:26:39,946
-Sweetchuck.
-Me?

351
00:26:40,033 --> 00:26:42,831
-Order the dogs to sit.
-They won't listen to me.

352
00:26:42,913 --> 00:26:44,744
They will. Come on, try.

353
00:26:46,473 --> 00:26:47,906
Go on, have a seat.

354
00:26:51,433 --> 00:26:53,947
You've got to show them who's boss.

355
00:26:54,873 --> 00:26:56,101
Sit!

356
00:27:08,513 --> 00:27:10,105
At this time...

357
00:27:10,513 --> 00:27:13,346
I would like to introduce to all of you...

358
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:17,427
my instructor,
the man who taught me how to fight.

359
00:27:19,313 --> 00:27:21,622
Please welcome, if you will...

360
00:27:22,393 --> 00:27:24,224
Sgt. John Hurney.

361
00:27:50,193 --> 00:27:52,866
Now, can I have a volunteer?

362
00:27:54,153 --> 00:27:57,668
Can I have a volunteer?
Very good, Nogata.

363
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:30,425
I don't believe it.

364
00:28:34,033 --> 00:28:35,148
Oh, boy!

365
00:28:37,153 --> 00:28:38,222
He's great!

366
00:28:56,953 --> 00:29:00,229
You have impressive moves for a cadet.

367
00:29:00,873 --> 00:29:02,101
Thank you.

368
00:29:02,193 --> 00:29:05,981
You see, it's a matter of the mind
being mightier than the bosom.

369
00:29:08,873 --> 00:29:10,545
Interesting theory.

370
00:29:15,753 --> 00:29:17,983
I said bosom, not sword.

371
00:29:18,073 --> 00:29:19,506
Sounds like a common mistake.

372
00:29:19,593 --> 00:29:24,462
No. I mean no disrespect.
It's just that she's so....

373
00:29:27,113 --> 00:29:28,705
What a woman!

374
00:29:30,273 --> 00:29:31,786
Hit the showers!

375
00:29:32,273 --> 00:29:33,831
See what I mean?

376
00:29:34,393 --> 00:29:35,985
Let's go!

377
00:29:55,353 --> 00:29:56,706
Miss Macho.

378
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:03,949
All right, men, it's 22:00.

379
00:30:04,753 --> 00:30:06,505
Time to hit the sack.

380
00:30:08,193 --> 00:30:09,421
Let's go.

381
00:30:10,553 --> 00:30:12,464
<i>You're dead meat, copper!</i>

382
00:30:17,753 --> 00:30:19,232
Let's move it!

383
00:30:25,193 --> 00:30:27,707
-What time is it?
-3:00 in the morning.

384
00:30:33,433 --> 00:30:36,072
All right, everybody!
Everybody up! Let's go!

385
00:30:39,473 --> 00:30:40,872
Outside!

386
00:30:42,433 --> 00:30:43,707
Let's go!

387
00:30:51,913 --> 00:30:55,747
<i>Come on, you sludge buckets.</i>
<i>If I can keep up this pace, so can you.</i>

388
00:30:56,113 --> 00:30:57,626
<i>Let's go, maggots.</i>

389
00:30:57,713 --> 00:31:02,468
<i>A good cop is always prepared.</i>
<i>A good cop knows the city streets.</i>

390
00:31:06,233 --> 00:31:08,872
-Are you gonna be all right, Hedges?
-He'll be okay.

391
00:31:08,953 --> 00:31:11,865
-Can I help you with anything?
-No, we're here now.

392
00:31:12,393 --> 00:31:15,305
-Bye, Hedges.
-I'll have to be fed intravenously.

393
00:31:15,713 --> 00:31:17,146
Just lie down.

394
00:31:28,593 --> 00:31:29,662
What is this?

395
00:31:29,753 --> 00:31:32,586
It's my bed. I pick up in New Delhi.

396
00:31:32,713 --> 00:31:35,591
Posture-o-pedic. Very good for back.

397
00:31:46,633 --> 00:31:48,589
Hello?

398
00:31:50,113 --> 00:31:51,432
Who is that?

399
00:31:57,193 --> 00:31:59,582
Do you want to, like,
borrow my shampoo?

400
00:32:07,953 --> 00:32:10,228
Freeze! Identify yourself.

401
00:32:10,473 --> 00:32:11,872
It's me, Mr. Sweetchuck.

402
00:32:11,953 --> 00:32:14,990
You look like a man
who's going AWOL to me, mister.

403
00:32:15,073 --> 00:32:18,622
Yeah, I am. I'm tired of having a roommate
that's an animal!

404
00:32:18,753 --> 00:32:21,392
I was happier when I was at home
getting mugged!

405
00:32:21,473 --> 00:32:24,624
You look me in the eye
and tell me you're quitting!

406
00:32:27,433 --> 00:32:29,583
Don't worry. I'll take care of you.

407
00:32:30,313 --> 00:32:32,144
You give me a chance...

408
00:32:32,713 --> 00:32:34,624
and I'll make you into a man.

409
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:37,505
Even if it kills you.

410
00:32:44,233 --> 00:32:46,463
Feel good? Let's go.

411
00:32:51,113 --> 00:32:51,989
Sergeant.

412
00:33:06,593 --> 00:33:08,823
A good kick may be all that stands...

413
00:33:08,913 --> 00:33:11,666
between you and the excruciating pain...

414
00:33:11,753 --> 00:33:15,587
of a.357 magnum slug
shredding your vital organs.

415
00:33:16,633 --> 00:33:18,464
Fackler! You're up.

416
00:33:26,153 --> 00:33:27,381
Kirkland!

417
00:33:41,033 --> 00:33:42,148
Zed!

418
00:33:50,753 --> 00:33:53,108
-Sweetchuck!
-Sweetchuck, what's the word?

419
00:33:53,193 --> 00:33:54,626
-Kill.
-Let me hear it again.

420
00:33:54,713 --> 00:33:56,385
-Kill.
-Now go for it!

421
00:34:04,513 --> 00:34:06,743
Whose bright idea was it to meet here?

422
00:34:06,833 --> 00:34:08,585
It was my bright idea.

423
00:34:09,153 --> 00:34:11,906
This is some beautiful view, isn't it, sir?

424
00:34:12,553 --> 00:34:16,228
The twinkling lights of the city,
stars in the heavens...

425
00:34:16,313 --> 00:34:17,985
the moon in the sky.

426
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:22,148
And Mr. Sandman flying
from rooftop to rooftop.

427
00:34:22,233 --> 00:34:23,382
Where?

428
00:34:23,473 --> 00:34:25,304
What the hell is that?

429
00:34:25,633 --> 00:34:28,864
Give me this damn thing.
Well, how'd it go?

430
00:34:28,953 --> 00:34:31,228
The committee knew right away
we were hopeless.

431
00:34:31,313 --> 00:34:32,348
Good.

432
00:34:33,073 --> 00:34:36,031
Now, I want you guys
to take the cadets downtown...

433
00:34:36,113 --> 00:34:37,148
for some fieldwork.

434
00:34:37,233 --> 00:34:40,942
We can't do that. Cadets don't go
into the field till after their tenth week.

435
00:34:41,033 --> 00:34:44,389
-They're not ready for anything like that.
-I know that, you moron.

436
00:34:44,473 --> 00:34:49,103
That's the whole idea. Next week, the
evaluation committee is gonna be there.

437
00:34:49,193 --> 00:34:52,071
-I get it, sir.
-I doubt it.

438
00:34:53,073 --> 00:34:54,426
Sorry, sir.

439
00:34:55,273 --> 00:34:58,151
I'm gonna be there
when Lassard's guys screw up.

440
00:34:58,233 --> 00:35:01,225
You guys make sure they screw up. Get it?

441
00:35:01,313 --> 00:35:03,508
-Yes, sir.
-Good.

442
00:35:21,393 --> 00:35:23,111
Punch him!

443
00:35:26,193 --> 00:35:30,630
One, two, three, four.

444
00:35:33,153 --> 00:35:35,621
That's great. He's looking tired. Good.

445
00:35:35,713 --> 00:35:37,510
Your legs are rubbery.

446
00:35:40,553 --> 00:35:44,626
-Knock him out. Let me hear you say it.
-Knock him out.

447
00:36:11,433 --> 00:36:12,582
What are you doing?

448
00:36:12,673 --> 00:36:16,302
That's not the way I taught you to hit.
You gotta hit like this. Like this!

449
00:36:16,393 --> 00:36:17,826
Now, hit him!

450
00:36:40,753 --> 00:36:45,383
The eyewitness is still
the main source of convictions.

451
00:36:46,033 --> 00:36:49,946
Mr. Miller, I want you to take your time.
Study these men very carefully.

452
00:36:50,113 --> 00:36:52,991
Then tell us if you see the man
who robbed your store.

453
00:36:53,073 --> 00:36:54,791
Let me reassure you, Mr. Miller...

454
00:36:54,873 --> 00:36:58,024
the suspects cannot see you
when it's dark in here.

455
00:36:59,993 --> 00:37:02,143
Well, Mr. Miller? Is he there?

456
00:37:02,993 --> 00:37:06,747
Are you sure they can't see me? My wife
said they'd see me, and not to do this.

457
00:37:06,833 --> 00:37:09,631
Mr. Miller, bright lights in there...

458
00:37:09,713 --> 00:37:13,342
dark in here. He can't see us.
Do you see him?

459
00:37:14,913 --> 00:37:16,904
Bringing cadets into the field this early...

460
00:37:16,993 --> 00:37:19,348
has all the makings
of one of your lousy ideas.

461
00:37:19,433 --> 00:37:21,822
What's the matter, Mahoney?
No faith in the cadets?

462
00:37:21,913 --> 00:37:24,302
How hard can it be, Miller?
Is he there or isn't he?

463
00:37:24,393 --> 00:37:27,624
I don't know.
He really didn't steal that much.

464
00:37:28,033 --> 00:37:30,547
The hospital stay was quite restful.

465
00:37:31,073 --> 00:37:32,631
I wish I'd listened to my wife.

466
00:37:32,713 --> 00:37:36,706
For God's sake, Miller, will you
take your balls out of your wife's purse...

467
00:37:36,793 --> 00:37:38,590
and finger the dirtbag?

468
00:37:39,113 --> 00:37:40,307
It's him!

469
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:44,188
-I'll kill you!
-No, it's him.

470
00:37:44,273 --> 00:37:45,991
He's the one, the priest.

471
00:37:52,793 --> 00:37:56,069
Sir, honestly, we had no idea
the evaluation committee would be here.

472
00:37:56,153 --> 00:37:58,144
We thought
it would help advance the training.

473
00:37:58,233 --> 00:38:01,145
-What do you mean, we?
-It was a lousy idea.

474
00:38:01,233 --> 00:38:05,306
Now I've got a bunch trainees hanging
around with this damn committee!

475
00:38:06,353 --> 00:38:09,709
I've been, like, noticing you,
and you're a nice enough lady...

476
00:38:09,793 --> 00:38:11,624
but you're too tense.

477
00:38:11,713 --> 00:38:14,147
You got to relax. You got to calm down.

478
00:38:19,833 --> 00:38:22,666
You take the big guy,
I'll take the little guy.

479
00:38:23,073 --> 00:38:24,472
We got a cop.

480
00:38:32,993 --> 00:38:35,143
No sweat. This is my old gang.

481
00:38:36,873 --> 00:38:41,185
Would you like to go out to grab a burger
and then go to the movies or something?

482
00:38:41,713 --> 00:38:45,308
I'd like to introduce you guys
to the future Mrs. Zed!

483
00:39:09,033 --> 00:39:10,148
Hey, son.

484
00:39:10,833 --> 00:39:12,983
-Excuse me, Officer.
-Yes, ma'am?

485
00:39:13,073 --> 00:39:15,507
We are sitting in the nonsmoking section...

486
00:39:15,593 --> 00:39:19,108
and that man refuses to put out his cigar.

487
00:39:20,873 --> 00:39:23,068
I'll take care of this, ma'am.

488
00:39:23,433 --> 00:39:25,185
Excuse me, sir.

489
00:39:25,513 --> 00:39:29,745
You're sitting in a nonsmoking area.
Would you please extinguish that cigar?

490
00:39:29,833 --> 00:39:31,949
Drop dead. I'll put it out when I'm finished.

491
00:39:32,033 --> 00:39:34,149
You'll put it out now, mister!

492
00:39:48,633 --> 00:39:49,748
Hit it!

493
00:39:50,793 --> 00:39:52,112
Now, go get him!

494
00:40:03,113 --> 00:40:05,581
-Hurry up!
-I'm trying. I'm going as fast--

495
00:40:05,673 --> 00:40:06,788
Drive!

496
00:40:27,713 --> 00:40:29,908
Will this count against us, sir?

497
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:36,829
I've been here at the academy
many wonderful years...

498
00:40:36,913 --> 00:40:38,790
and I'm very fond of it.

499
00:40:40,033 --> 00:40:42,467
-The new cadets are doing well?
-Yes, sir.

500
00:40:42,553 --> 00:40:46,466
-We are going to succeed now, aren't we?
-Yes, sir.

501
00:40:47,593 --> 00:40:48,662
Good.

502
00:41:08,713 --> 00:41:12,786
One more ping out of you, Jonesey,
I'll tape your lips permanently together.

503
00:41:17,753 --> 00:41:19,311
Listen, everybody.

504
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:22,829
I want you to forget today. You don't have
to be ready for the field yet.

505
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:25,473
-We sure proved that.
-It wasn't a total loss.

506
00:41:25,553 --> 00:41:27,225
Of course it wasn't.

507
00:41:27,313 --> 00:41:30,225
One police car and two civilian cars
completely totaled...

508
00:41:30,313 --> 00:41:31,792
three citizens' complaints...

509
00:41:31,873 --> 00:41:35,422
two members of the evaluation committee
under heavy sedation.

510
00:41:35,513 --> 00:41:38,152
I wouldn't call it a total loss,
would you? No.

511
00:41:38,233 --> 00:41:41,589
Bartender, how about some champagne
for me and my associate?

512
00:41:41,673 --> 00:41:44,062
We're celebrating. Come on, Proctor.

513
00:41:47,593 --> 00:41:49,823
-Let's just get out of here.
-No.

514
00:41:56,513 --> 00:41:58,788
Boy, that's a waste of champagne, sir.

515
00:41:58,873 --> 00:42:01,228
Now, what is that crack
supposed to mean, Mahoney?

516
00:42:01,313 --> 00:42:06,023
It means we don't think you can tell the
difference between beer and champagne.

517
00:42:07,153 --> 00:42:09,269
You know something?
You two are brain dead.

518
00:42:09,353 --> 00:42:11,389
Bet you can't. Loser pays.

519
00:42:12,033 --> 00:42:15,230
-You're on, Mahoney.
-Can I have a beer in the same glass?

520
00:42:15,313 --> 00:42:17,190
-Mind if we blindfold you, sir?
-Why?

521
00:42:17,273 --> 00:42:19,229
-We wouldn't want you to peek.
-Right.

522
00:42:19,313 --> 00:42:21,463
-See anything?
-No.

523
00:42:21,553 --> 00:42:22,827
-Sure?
-No, I can't see.

524
00:42:22,913 --> 00:42:25,950
Okay. Round and round
and guess the drink.

525
00:42:32,993 --> 00:42:34,267
Champagne!

526
00:42:34,953 --> 00:42:36,591
You win! He always wins!

527
00:42:38,153 --> 00:42:40,747
All right, we'll pay up.
Let's get out of here.

528
00:42:40,833 --> 00:42:43,631
-You two jerks.
-You really showed them, sir.

529
00:42:47,873 --> 00:42:49,591
-Proctor.
-Yes, sir?

530
00:42:50,033 --> 00:42:52,547
Give me a hand with this. Take it off.

531
00:42:53,393 --> 00:42:56,271
No, don't go slow.
Go fast, so it doesn't hurt.

532
00:43:00,153 --> 00:43:02,906
That hurt. Am I okay?

533
00:43:02,993 --> 00:43:05,746
It's nice. There's a mirror right here, sir.

534
00:43:08,033 --> 00:43:09,591
I got no eyebrows.

535
00:43:10,633 --> 00:43:13,306
-Where are my eyebrows?
-Right here, sir.

536
00:43:15,273 --> 00:43:17,992
-This is going very well.
-Yeah?

537
00:43:18,593 --> 00:43:21,471
Yeah. That's great. It's coming.

538
00:43:22,273 --> 00:43:25,390
That's great. That's nice.
You're gonna like that, sir.

539
00:43:25,473 --> 00:43:26,667
Let me see it.

540
00:43:27,193 --> 00:43:30,105
Look at that. Look at this,
this angle over here, every angle.

541
00:43:30,193 --> 00:43:32,309
-I can't see it!
-It's yours.

542
00:43:36,353 --> 00:43:38,264
What do you think, sir?

543
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,148
I think I like it.

544
00:43:40,553 --> 00:43:42,828
Commissioner Hurst was very upset.

545
00:43:43,433 --> 00:43:47,267
He used many bad words
to describe our academy.

546
00:43:47,393 --> 00:43:48,872
Some were even foreign.

547
00:43:48,953 --> 00:43:51,706
Italian or Irish, I think.

548
00:43:53,513 --> 00:43:56,027
This is survival of the fittest...

549
00:43:56,313 --> 00:43:58,702
and after what happened downtown...

550
00:43:58,793 --> 00:44:00,272
it seems we're not very fit.

551
00:44:00,353 --> 00:44:04,346
-Sir, you're not giving up, are you?
-Of course not.

552
00:44:04,673 --> 00:44:07,346
I have no doubt we shall be victorious.

553
00:44:09,033 --> 00:44:12,821
I have a little doubt,
but, basically, I'm an optimist.

554
00:44:12,913 --> 00:44:16,952
Now, I know the committee
will be observing us here...

555
00:44:18,353 --> 00:44:22,107
and in the field,
and at the Policepersons Ball...

556
00:44:22,513 --> 00:44:25,664
so we must do nothing
to dishonor the uniform.

557
00:44:29,353 --> 00:44:31,787
-What was I saying?
-Dismissed!

558
00:44:31,873 --> 00:44:32,988
Right.

559
00:44:34,993 --> 00:44:37,905
This map will pinpoint trouble spots...

560
00:44:37,993 --> 00:44:40,348
over a 10-square-mile area.

561
00:44:41,153 --> 00:44:44,748
This dispatch unit has a 200-mile range...

562
00:44:46,033 --> 00:44:48,069
and a computerized city grid.

563
00:44:48,153 --> 00:44:51,782
This computerized city grid
tracks police vehicle movement.

564
00:44:52,673 --> 00:44:55,312
-Is that clear, everyone?
-Yes, ma'am!

565
00:44:55,393 --> 00:44:56,826
Yeah, why not?

566
00:44:59,153 --> 00:45:03,066
In tear gas training, the manual says
you should have your mask on.

567
00:45:03,233 --> 00:45:07,146
Be out of here 30 seconds after
the canister comes through the window.

568
00:45:07,233 --> 00:45:08,666
Any questions?

569
00:45:10,153 --> 00:45:11,381
Good luck.

570
00:45:22,033 --> 00:45:24,991
-Nice throw, Hightower.
-It went in, didn't it?

571
00:45:28,953 --> 00:45:30,591
All right, everybody out!

572
00:45:35,713 --> 00:45:38,102
Everybody present and accounted for?

573
00:45:43,273 --> 00:45:46,504
I feel good. I'll be in there if you need me.

574
00:45:51,953 --> 00:45:54,751
Look, I know you people
have had a tough week...

575
00:45:54,833 --> 00:45:56,983
but there's something you should know.

576
00:45:57,073 --> 00:46:00,065
You may be the last class
to attend this academy.

577
00:46:00,553 --> 00:46:04,262
I don't know if this means anything to you,
but it sure does to us.

578
00:46:04,833 --> 00:46:08,462
That's why, we not only
want you to keep up the good work...

579
00:46:08,553 --> 00:46:10,225
we want you to work harder.

580
00:46:10,313 --> 00:46:12,349
Because we think that you people...

581
00:46:12,433 --> 00:46:14,583
can be the best class
this academy has ever seen.

582
00:46:14,673 --> 00:46:16,470
You can do it. Believe me.

583
00:46:16,553 --> 00:46:18,430
Once, even I was a screw-up.

584
00:46:18,913 --> 00:46:22,269
Let's go out there and win one
for Comdt. Lassard, okay?

585
00:46:22,353 --> 00:46:24,389
Okay? Yeah, come on.

586
00:46:28,273 --> 00:46:29,831
Attention!

587
00:46:30,753 --> 00:46:31,902
Dismissed.

588
00:46:33,233 --> 00:46:34,632
Did you hear that?

589
00:46:34,713 --> 00:46:37,785
No? Of course not. How silly of me to ask.

590
00:46:37,873 --> 00:46:40,023
You're too far from the window.

591
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,351
-Look sharp, Mahoney.
-Right.

592
00:46:44,433 --> 00:46:45,946
-Sgt. Mahoney.
-Yeah.

593
00:46:46,033 --> 00:46:48,422
I was really impressed by what you said.

594
00:46:48,593 --> 00:46:49,946
You really care.

595
00:46:50,353 --> 00:46:53,106
Yeah. Just don't spread it around.
It might ruin my rep.

596
00:46:53,193 --> 00:46:56,947
I owe you an apology for the way I acted.
You were just trying to be cute.

597
00:46:57,033 --> 00:47:01,788
Trying? On a cuteness scale of one to ten,
I'm an eight.

598
00:47:01,953 --> 00:47:03,989
-Five.
-You're right, I am a five.

599
00:47:04,273 --> 00:47:07,470
Listen, I'll accept your apology
if you accept mine.

600
00:47:07,913 --> 00:47:10,381
-Deal.
-All right. You know something?

601
00:47:10,473 --> 00:47:13,670
Have you ever felt,
after meeting someone for ten minutes...

602
00:47:13,753 --> 00:47:16,347
-you've known them for two, three years?
-No.

603
00:47:19,633 --> 00:47:21,828
-Thanks, Mahoney.
-Welcome, sir.

604
00:47:42,993 --> 00:47:46,906
Excuse, please. Shall I come back
when all is well with your mind?

605
00:47:47,793 --> 00:47:51,103
My mind is as well as it gets,
but you look a little tense.

606
00:47:51,793 --> 00:47:54,865
You see, I have great confusions...

607
00:47:55,473 --> 00:47:57,782
about Sgt. Callahan.

608
00:48:00,593 --> 00:48:02,982
You've come to the right place, brother.

609
00:48:03,553 --> 00:48:06,704
Grab yourself pad and pencil because...

610
00:48:07,393 --> 00:48:10,510
the love doctor is about to speak.

611
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:25,144
In my country, it is written...

612
00:48:25,233 --> 00:48:28,384
only kiss of beautiful woman...

613
00:48:28,993 --> 00:48:32,702
can compare to petal of a rose...

614
00:48:35,113 --> 00:48:36,182
babe.

615
00:48:41,673 --> 00:48:44,141
In America, talk is cheap.

616
00:48:48,913 --> 00:48:51,029
I love America.

617
00:49:18,593 --> 00:49:21,027
Hi, there. Remember me?

618
00:49:23,233 --> 00:49:25,622
Yes, of course. How could I forget?

619
00:49:25,873 --> 00:49:27,431
Who was that?

620
00:49:27,873 --> 00:49:29,545
Just an old friend.

621
00:49:30,113 --> 00:49:33,423
Why are we celebrating?
It's Mauser, 42. Lassard, zip.

622
00:49:33,513 --> 00:49:35,504
You think we're doing that well?

623
00:49:38,233 --> 00:49:40,747
How's tricks? Not to worry.

624
00:49:42,753 --> 00:49:45,142
Your friend forgot to wear
her "for rent" sign.

625
00:49:45,233 --> 00:49:49,192
She's such a sweet kid.
My aerobics instructor.

626
00:49:50,593 --> 00:49:54,745
Mahoney, see this ear?
It's a finely tuned crap detector.

627
00:49:54,993 --> 00:49:58,872
And a lovely ear it is. If I blow in it,
will you follow me anywhere?

628
00:50:00,233 --> 00:50:02,793
I'm surprised
you had the nerve to show up...

629
00:50:02,873 --> 00:50:05,785
after your cadets humiliated
the Police Department.

630
00:50:05,913 --> 00:50:08,029
Personally, it makes me sick.

631
00:50:08,353 --> 00:50:11,470
How about you guys?
Don't you guys think....

632
00:50:14,033 --> 00:50:15,830
Coming, Commissioner.

633
00:50:19,313 --> 00:50:21,873
Will you think less of me
if I call him a slime bucket?

634
00:50:21,953 --> 00:50:25,866
In fact, I'll have my aerobics instructor
confirm it. I'll be right back.

635
00:50:28,753 --> 00:50:32,712
-So, how you doing?
-Terrific. I need one of your special favors.

636
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:34,307
Right here?

637
00:50:42,353 --> 00:50:45,584
I just love a man
that eats shrimp that way.

638
00:50:45,673 --> 00:50:48,028
-You do?
-Oh, yes.

639
00:50:49,073 --> 00:50:50,222
Come on.

640
00:50:52,673 --> 00:50:56,302
-How does he do that?
-The question is, why does he do that?

641
00:50:56,913 --> 00:50:59,188
It is a power of the mind.

642
00:51:21,873 --> 00:51:23,022
Allow me.

643
00:51:23,113 --> 00:51:26,025
What kind of idiot klutz are you?

644
00:51:27,033 --> 00:51:28,625
Come on, dumpling.

645
00:51:28,713 --> 00:51:32,342
I witnessed the entire attack, sir.
My apologies, Mrs. Hurst.

646
00:51:32,513 --> 00:51:36,506
May I say Copeland is not one of my
cadets. He is a member of Lassard's staff.

647
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:40,188
You look different, Mauser.
Are you putting on weight?

648
00:51:40,673 --> 00:51:42,948
Come on, dumpling.
We'll get you cleaned up.

649
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:46,867
That's Lassard's staff, sir.
Send me the cleaning bill on that, sir.

650
00:51:57,033 --> 00:51:58,785
You want the last shrimp?

651
00:51:59,393 --> 00:52:03,386
-There's only one thing that I want.
-What? I'll call room service.

652
00:52:03,553 --> 00:52:04,986
Don't be silly.

653
00:52:05,593 --> 00:52:09,745
What I want is for you to wait in there,
in the bathroom...

654
00:52:09,833 --> 00:52:11,186
while I get ready.

655
00:52:11,273 --> 00:52:13,787
-Why can't I wait in here?
-We just met.

656
00:52:13,873 --> 00:52:16,751
Come on, can't a girl be
a little bit old-fashioned?

657
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:20,064
I'll call you just as soon as I'm ready.

658
00:52:22,993 --> 00:52:24,984
Come on, it's kind of drafty.

659
00:52:26,353 --> 00:52:27,786
I'll get some help.

660
00:52:28,233 --> 00:52:30,747
A little patience. I'll be out in a minute.

661
00:52:31,233 --> 00:52:33,508
Hurry up. Somebody wants to use the....

662
00:52:37,073 --> 00:52:39,951
Come on, let me in! Hurry up!

663
00:52:42,233 --> 00:52:44,542
You should be ashamed of yourself.

664
00:52:46,673 --> 00:52:48,789
I'll make up your room in a minute.

665
00:52:49,593 --> 00:52:51,470
Where you going with my cart?

666
00:52:51,713 --> 00:52:54,068
-My cart.
-Let me borrow it.

667
00:52:54,153 --> 00:52:55,825
I'm a police officer--

668
00:52:56,833 --> 00:52:58,107
It's mine.

669
00:53:04,993 --> 00:53:06,392
Warm tonight.

670
00:53:08,033 --> 00:53:09,512
How's it going?

671
00:54:49,753 --> 00:54:52,984
...hands him the ticket,
and the driver said--

672
00:54:53,833 --> 00:54:56,666
That's real funny, sir.
Great joke teller, the Commissioner.

673
00:54:56,753 --> 00:54:58,983
Are you enjoying yourselves?
Are you comfortable?

674
00:54:59,073 --> 00:55:01,462
Waiter, round of drinks. On me.

675
00:55:01,713 --> 00:55:03,863
Drinks are free, you idiot.

676
00:55:04,873 --> 00:55:07,023
Yes, sir. How stupid of me.

677
00:55:07,233 --> 00:55:09,428
If you don't mind
my saying so, Mrs. Hurst...

678
00:55:09,513 --> 00:55:12,186
that fruit punch stain dried real nicely.

679
00:55:14,753 --> 00:55:17,790
You are not going to influence
this evaluation committee.

680
00:55:17,873 --> 00:55:20,671
So will you please stop all this slobbering?

681
00:55:21,593 --> 00:55:25,586
I think I can get it under control
if I could only find out who's winning.

682
00:55:26,273 --> 00:55:30,346
Let's just say that Lassard's cadets
have not exactly impressed them.

683
00:55:31,153 --> 00:55:33,064
Thank you very much, sir.

684
00:55:33,153 --> 00:55:35,189
Get hold of yourself, man.

685
00:55:36,353 --> 00:55:38,913
Good Lord! You're falling apart.

686
00:55:41,673 --> 00:55:44,312
-Excuse me. Commissioner?
-What the hell do you want?

687
00:55:44,393 --> 00:55:47,191
We've had reports of a naked man
terrorizing the hotel.

688
00:55:47,273 --> 00:55:49,548
He's obviously not at this table.

689
00:55:49,793 --> 00:55:51,465
-Mauser!
-Yes, sir.

690
00:55:51,553 --> 00:55:53,862
Would you take care of this naked person?

691
00:55:53,953 --> 00:55:56,626
Naked person, yes, sir!
I'll get right on top of him!

692
00:55:56,713 --> 00:55:57,623
Proctor!

693
00:56:31,113 --> 00:56:35,789
Glad to see you enjoying yourselves, men,
despite the bad news.

694
00:56:35,873 --> 00:56:37,511
Bad news? There's been bad news?

695
00:56:37,593 --> 00:56:41,427
Well, bad news for you, good news for me.

696
00:56:42,113 --> 00:56:44,388
Your cadets have been doing
their usual fine job...

697
00:56:44,473 --> 00:56:47,351
so it looks like I've got this one in the bag.

698
00:56:47,433 --> 00:56:51,187
Congratulations! I'm so happy
when someone I know wins.

699
00:56:51,273 --> 00:56:53,912
I always think these contests are fixed.

700
00:56:54,433 --> 00:56:55,707
Wait a minute.

701
00:56:56,073 --> 00:56:58,871
-If you're winning, then....
-You're losing.

702
00:57:00,153 --> 00:57:02,030
Sorry to spoil your fun.

703
00:57:03,673 --> 00:57:05,948
-It's not fair.
-Any ideas?

704
00:57:06,113 --> 00:57:09,662
I could twist off Mauser's shiny head
and roll it down the street.

705
00:57:10,433 --> 00:57:12,503
Hold that thought, Hightower.

706
00:57:23,193 --> 00:57:24,751
Come on. Damn it!

707
00:58:26,113 --> 00:58:28,024
Governor, Commissioner--

708
00:58:28,353 --> 00:58:29,832
Ladies and gentlemen...

709
00:58:29,913 --> 00:58:34,623
may I introduce you to a very special man,
Comdt. Mauser.

710
00:58:35,153 --> 00:58:38,463
As you know, the committee's
been evaluating both of our academies...

711
00:58:38,553 --> 00:58:40,384
and they're very close to a decision.

712
00:58:40,473 --> 00:58:42,384
And you know what this man
said about that?

713
00:58:42,473 --> 00:58:43,906
It's a fact....

714
00:58:44,113 --> 00:58:45,785
It's a "facahamahoma."

715
00:58:45,913 --> 00:58:47,505
Does this man have a way with words?

716
00:58:47,593 --> 00:58:51,347
He said you can't judge an academy
by rushing its cadets out into the field...

717
00:58:51,433 --> 00:58:54,266
or by seeing whose cadets
marched the straightest, no.

718
00:58:54,353 --> 00:58:58,028
Do you know what the man,
I like to call "Mr. Policeman," said?

719
00:58:58,153 --> 00:59:01,065
"Forget any mistakes cadets
have made over the last few weeks.

720
00:59:01,153 --> 00:59:02,381
"They were just learning.

721
00:59:02,473 --> 00:59:05,943
"It's these last days of competition
that should determine the winner."

722
00:59:06,033 --> 00:59:08,831
Comdt. Mauser, I salute you.

723
00:59:09,393 --> 00:59:10,985
We all salute you!

724
00:59:28,193 --> 00:59:31,708
<i>This is the final day</i>
<i>of the evaluation competition...</i>

725
00:59:32,273 --> 00:59:35,868
<i>and though Comdt. Mauser's academy</i>
<i>is in the lead...</i>

726
00:59:36,193 --> 00:59:40,823
<i>it's how you perform today</i>
<i>that will determine our winner.</i>

727
00:59:42,033 --> 00:59:44,672
<i>Police personnel</i>
<i>will monitor your performance...</i>

728
00:59:44,753 --> 00:59:46,391
<i>at crime locations.</i>

729
00:59:47,073 --> 00:59:51,589
<i>My advice is to treat this</i>
<i>exactly as if it were real.</i>

730
00:59:52,633 --> 00:59:53,907
<i>Attention!</i>

731
00:59:55,113 --> 00:59:56,387
<i>Dismissed!</i>

732
01:00:03,193 --> 01:00:06,708
I'm going to accompany the Governor
to the charity regatta.

733
01:00:06,793 --> 01:00:09,182
He wants one cadet
from each academy to go with us.

734
01:00:09,273 --> 01:00:10,592
But the competition, sir.

735
01:00:10,673 --> 01:00:15,224
The Governor thought it would be nice
to evaluate cadets in a social situation.

736
01:00:17,073 --> 01:00:19,792
Proctor, what is this?
Hurst said one from each academy.

737
01:00:19,873 --> 01:00:22,626
They're just as good as one man, almost.

738
01:00:29,313 --> 01:00:32,988
The phone's got my quarter
and the operator won't give it back to me.

739
01:00:33,073 --> 01:00:34,665
I'll handle this, ma'am.

740
01:00:35,713 --> 01:00:38,705
-Operator, this is Sgt. Tackleberry.
<i>-So?</i>

741
01:00:38,793 --> 01:00:42,866
-Please relinquish this lady's quarter.
<i>-I told her we'll send her a refund.</i>

742
01:00:43,513 --> 01:00:47,188
-You'll pay her now!
<i>-I'm sorry, sir, would you like to speak to--</i>

743
01:00:47,753 --> 01:00:49,391
Stand back, ma'am.

744
01:00:58,273 --> 01:01:00,343
Can you identify your quarter, ma'am?

745
01:01:03,513 --> 01:01:06,789
Sgt. Hooks, we got a 10-48 in Sector 1.

746
01:01:06,873 --> 01:01:08,306
Send in Tackleberry.

747
01:01:08,393 --> 01:01:12,671
Tackleberry? He's across town.
Hightower's only three blocks away.

748
01:01:12,753 --> 01:01:14,425
Send in Tackleberry.

749
01:01:14,513 --> 01:01:16,231
You heard him. Do it.

750
01:01:43,473 --> 01:01:45,941
-Sweetchuck!
-What a lobby.

751
01:01:52,233 --> 01:01:54,701
Secure the elevator. I'll take the stairs.

752
01:02:26,113 --> 01:02:27,068
Easy.

753
01:02:30,233 --> 01:02:32,463
Sgt. Hooks, there's a 10-48!

754
01:02:32,633 --> 01:02:34,828
All right. Send in car 46.

755
01:02:35,273 --> 01:02:37,423
<i>Car 46.</i>

756
01:02:38,193 --> 01:02:41,230
<i>Hightower, there's a roving gang</i>
<i>in the Gower district.</i>

757
01:02:41,633 --> 01:02:43,191
Oh, boy, this is it.

758
01:02:47,913 --> 01:02:48,902
Right, right.

759
01:02:48,993 --> 01:02:51,507
Take a left....
No, you're going towards the expressway!

760
01:02:51,593 --> 01:02:52,628
Take a U-turn on....

761
01:02:53,633 --> 01:02:55,863
<i>Make a U-turn on Flint Street....</i>

762
01:02:55,953 --> 01:02:58,911
No, you're going towards the expressway!
What is that?

763
01:03:00,513 --> 01:03:02,265
No, wait, make a U-turn!

764
01:03:02,353 --> 01:03:04,309
-Where are we going?
-Just relax.

765
01:03:12,553 --> 01:03:13,906
Not a word.

766
01:03:15,553 --> 01:03:19,148
...then you go around. Stop! Don't....

767
01:03:39,233 --> 01:03:40,905
We're with the Governor at the trophy.

768
01:03:40,993 --> 01:03:43,223
The purpose of the regatta, of course...

769
01:03:43,313 --> 01:03:46,066
is we're hoping to raise about $20,000
for my campaign.

770
01:03:46,153 --> 01:03:47,188
I was going to--

771
01:03:47,273 --> 01:03:50,071
-Good luck, Governor.
-We're moving toward the punch bowl.

772
01:03:50,153 --> 01:03:52,348
Hello, Judge. Pick a winner.

773
01:03:52,833 --> 01:03:53,822
We've stopped.

774
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:56,222
-Would you back off?
-We're backing off.

775
01:03:56,393 --> 01:03:58,065
What are you trying to do, injure him?

776
01:03:58,153 --> 01:04:00,667
Comdt. Mauser's cadets
never abandon their posts, sir!

777
01:04:00,753 --> 01:04:02,584
Unlike some cadets I might mention, sir!

778
01:04:32,833 --> 01:04:34,505
Holy cow!

779
01:04:41,233 --> 01:04:43,701
<i>Mahoney, somebody, I need help.</i>

780
01:04:47,673 --> 01:04:50,710
Listen, the busboys...

781
01:04:50,913 --> 01:04:52,949
are shooting my nose.

782
01:04:53,353 --> 01:04:55,867
<i>Did you read that? Was that for real?</i>

783
01:04:55,953 --> 01:04:57,545
We heard it. Sir?

784
01:04:57,633 --> 01:05:00,352
-Maybe we better check it out.
-What about the evaluation?

785
01:05:00,433 --> 01:05:03,470
One of my boys may be in trouble.
Screw the evaluation.

786
01:05:03,553 --> 01:05:05,783
I love it when you talk dirty, sir.

787
01:05:05,873 --> 01:05:08,228
Mahoney must think
he's as dumb as we are.

788
01:05:08,313 --> 01:05:10,588
-We're not gonna fall for that stuff.
-Yeah.

789
01:05:10,673 --> 01:05:13,745
He must be getting desperate,
trying to sucker us with that crap.

790
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:21,471
Come on, let's go.

791
01:05:23,913 --> 01:05:26,381
Get your hands in the air. It's a stickup!

792
01:05:28,353 --> 01:05:30,742
If there was trouble,
Baxter would let us know.

793
01:05:30,833 --> 01:05:32,585
Take them, boys.

794
01:05:33,953 --> 01:05:35,545
Don't you touch that.

795
01:05:36,033 --> 01:05:38,103
No, not the one for bravery.

796
01:06:11,433 --> 01:06:13,025
There's the Yacht Club.

797
01:06:15,673 --> 01:06:17,743
How are we gonna get there, Sergeant?

798
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:22,190
How do you look in a wet suit?

799
01:06:22,273 --> 01:06:24,662
Hand over your money and jewels
and nobody gets hurt!

800
01:06:24,753 --> 01:06:26,983
You'll never get away with this.
I'm the Governor.

801
01:06:27,073 --> 01:06:30,304
The Governor? Did you hear that, boys?
We got the Governor.

802
01:06:31,473 --> 01:06:33,703
You must be breaking your mother's heart.

803
01:06:33,793 --> 01:06:36,387
Why don't you ask her?
She's right over there.

804
01:06:39,553 --> 01:06:40,952
She looks like you.

805
01:07:05,913 --> 01:07:08,188
Gather our boys. We got trouble coming!

806
01:07:31,353 --> 01:07:32,672
Spread out.

807
01:07:33,913 --> 01:07:34,982
I can't get Baxter.

808
01:07:35,073 --> 01:07:38,861
Something's going on at the marina.
Right over there. Take the next right.

809
01:07:54,953 --> 01:07:58,150
Just relax.
You've got the right to remain silent.

810
01:07:58,513 --> 01:08:00,629
-You passed it.
-They're not yielding.

811
01:08:00,713 --> 01:08:02,032
-Pull over to the right.
-Yield!

812
01:08:02,113 --> 01:08:03,865
You're missing it. There goes the right.

813
01:08:03,953 --> 01:08:06,023
We're in a police car
and they're not yielding.

814
01:08:13,273 --> 01:08:14,308
Move!

815
01:08:18,273 --> 01:08:20,833
Stop. Hold it. Mahoney!

816
01:08:20,913 --> 01:08:22,983
Police officer. Stop right there!

817
01:08:29,193 --> 01:08:31,946
Karen, I'm going after the Governor.

818
01:08:38,113 --> 01:08:39,546
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

819
01:08:39,633 --> 01:08:42,147
-You do look good in a wet suit.
-So do you.

820
01:08:57,233 --> 01:08:58,427
Freeze!

821
01:09:00,193 --> 01:09:01,421
Drop it!

822
01:09:05,473 --> 01:09:07,828
Go ahead. Make my day...

823
01:09:08,393 --> 01:09:09,508
punk!

824
01:09:13,873 --> 01:09:15,226
Freeze, cop!

825
01:09:17,313 --> 01:09:18,507
Trouble.

826
01:09:29,313 --> 01:09:31,463
Banzai!

827
01:09:57,713 --> 01:09:59,624
I didn't mean to hit you.

828
01:10:02,113 --> 01:10:04,786
I hate you.

829
01:10:31,473 --> 01:10:32,508
Pull over.

830
01:10:36,673 --> 01:10:38,470
Mahoney, you all right?

831
01:10:38,673 --> 01:10:40,948
I'm okay. Just keep going.

832
01:10:49,273 --> 01:10:51,070
Get out of my way, old man.

833
01:10:59,713 --> 01:11:01,624
Mahoney's in trouble. Let's go!

834
01:11:01,713 --> 01:11:02,828
You got it.

835
01:12:10,313 --> 01:12:11,905
Proctor, you're an idiot.

836
01:12:11,993 --> 01:12:14,905
You were born an idiot,
you'll always be an idiot.

837
01:12:32,713 --> 01:12:33,782
Dive.

838
01:13:44,433 --> 01:13:45,946
Move it, Proctor.

839
01:13:46,033 --> 01:13:48,627
I got this side,
you paddle on the other side.

840
01:13:50,313 --> 01:13:51,428
Hold it!

841
01:13:57,513 --> 01:13:58,946
You okay, sir?

842
01:14:08,993 --> 01:14:10,267
Look out.

843
01:14:47,433 --> 01:14:48,661
Let's talk.

844
01:15:14,073 --> 01:15:15,745
-You okay?
-You need help?

845
01:15:17,633 --> 01:15:19,624
-Where's the Governor?
-Governor!

846
01:15:22,633 --> 01:15:24,828
Don't move, dirtbag!

847
01:15:29,793 --> 01:15:32,512
All right! Can we go again?

848
01:15:51,153 --> 01:15:54,589
I'd like to thank all the members
of my racing team for their assistance.

849
01:15:54,673 --> 01:15:55,662
I couldn't have won....

850
01:15:55,753 --> 01:15:59,871
<i>...without the help of my</i>
<i>many wonderful instructors...</i>

851
01:15:59,953 --> 01:16:02,421
<i>and my many fine cadets.</i>

852
01:16:04,353 --> 01:16:05,866
<i>Thanks to all...</i>

853
01:16:05,953 --> 01:16:09,946
<i>this academy</i>
<i>will carry on its fine tradition.</i>
