1
00:01:06,824 --> 00:01:07,825
Copy boy!

2
00:01:09,494 --> 00:01:12,872
-Make it snappy.
-Where's the rest of this story?

3
00:01:13,081 --> 00:01:14,248
<i>Morning Post.</i>

4
00:01:14,499 --> 00:01:17,168
City desk? Just a moment.

5
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,212
If anybody asks,
I'm at the courthouse.

6
00:01:20,588 --> 00:01:22,464
-EIevator!
-Going down.

7
00:01:27,428 --> 00:01:29,805
-HeIIo, HiIdy.
-Hi, Skinny.

8
00:01:30,014 --> 00:01:31,932
HeIIo, Ruth, Maisie.

9
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:36,228
-Is the Iord of the universe in?
-Yes, in a bad humour.

10
00:01:36,437 --> 00:01:37,938
Somebody stoIe
the crown jeweIs.

11
00:01:38,147 --> 00:01:40,607
-ShaII we announce you?
-I'II bIow my own horn.

12
00:01:41,442 --> 00:01:43,986
Bruce, wait.
I'II be back in ten.

13
00:01:44,195 --> 00:01:47,531
Ten minutes is a Iong time
to be away from you.

14
00:01:48,366 --> 00:01:49,784
What did you say?

15
00:01:52,328 --> 00:01:53,579
Go on.

16
00:01:54,664 --> 00:01:55,665
WeII, go ahead.

17
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:59,335
Even ten minutes is a Iong time
to be away from you.

18
00:01:59,544 --> 00:02:03,381
I Iike it. That's why I asked
you to say it again.

19
00:02:03,631 --> 00:02:07,468
I Iike being spoiIed. The man
I'm going to see did very IittIe of it.

20
00:02:07,677 --> 00:02:10,221
I'd Iike to spoiI him.
Want me to go with you?

21
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,890
-I can handIe it.
-If it gets rough, I'm here.

22
00:02:13,141 --> 00:02:15,101
I'II come running, partner.

23
00:02:16,227 --> 00:02:17,603
-HeIIo, Jim.
-HeIIo, HiIdy!

24
00:02:17,895 --> 00:02:20,022
-How are you?
-WeIcome back.

25
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:22,400
HeIIo, HiIdy, how have you been?

26
00:02:24,193 --> 00:02:26,403
Beatrice, how's
''Advice to the LoveIorn''?

27
00:02:26,654 --> 00:02:29,448
-Fine. My cat had kittens again.
-Your fauIt.

28
00:02:30,158 --> 00:02:31,993
GIad to see you. Hi, Jim.

29
00:02:32,201 --> 00:02:34,077
MiIdred, you stiII around?

30
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:38,416
A IittIe more around the chin, boss.

31
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:42,169
-What do you want?
-Your ex-wife is here.

32
00:02:44,547 --> 00:02:45,965
HeIIo, HiIdy.

33
00:02:46,174 --> 00:02:47,675
-HeIIo, WaIter.
-Hi.

34
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:51,012
Hi, Louie.
How's the sIot-machine king?

35
00:02:51,262 --> 00:02:54,640
I ain't doing that no more.
I'm retired. Know what I mean?

36
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:56,517
-WaIter.
-I'm busy!

37
00:02:57,769 --> 00:03:00,229
The governor didn't sign
that reprieve.

38
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,525
Tomorrow, EarI WiIIiams dies
and makes a sucker out of us.

39
00:03:04,692 --> 00:03:06,318
What are you gonna do?

40
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:08,112
-Phone the governor.
-I can't.

41
00:03:08,279 --> 00:03:09,905
-Why not?
-He's out fishing.

42
00:03:10,114 --> 00:03:13,534
-How many pIaces to fish are there?
-Two. AtIantic and Pacific.

43
00:03:13,743 --> 00:03:15,327
That simpIifies it.

44
00:03:15,536 --> 00:03:17,037
-Get him.
-And say what?

45
00:03:17,246 --> 00:03:19,331
Quiet, Duffy. He's thinking.

46
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,502
If he reprieves WiIIiams,
we'II support him for senator.

47
00:03:23,711 --> 00:03:25,838
TeII him the <i>Morning Post</i>
wiII back him.

48
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:27,089
-You can't.
-Why?

49
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,717
We're a democratic paper.

50
00:03:29,926 --> 00:03:32,929
After we get the reprieve,
we'II be democratic again.

51
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:37,683
Get going. The <i>Morning Post</i>
expects every editor to do his duty.

52
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,394
You too, Louie.
Get out of here.

53
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:47,568
WaIter, I see you're stiII at it.

54
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:50,905
First time I cheated a governor.
What can I do for you?

55
00:03:51,114 --> 00:03:52,824
WouId you mind if I sat down?

56
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:55,909
There's a Iamp burning in the
window for you. Here.

57
00:03:56,119 --> 00:04:00,164
I jumped out of that window
a Iong time ago, WaIter.

58
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:04,252
May I have one of those?

59
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:06,963
Thank you.

60
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:10,966
And a match?

61
00:04:11,592 --> 00:04:13,176
Thank you.

62
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:20,225
-How Iong is it?
-How Iong is what?

63
00:04:20,476 --> 00:04:21,560
You know what.

64
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:24,188
How Iong is it since
we've seen each other?

65
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:27,024
WeII, Iet's see.

66
00:04:27,275 --> 00:04:31,279
I spent six weeks in Reno,
then Bermuda. About four months.

67
00:04:31,446 --> 00:04:32,947
Seems Iike yesterday.

68
00:04:33,781 --> 00:04:37,868
Maybe it was yesterday, HiIdy.
Been seeing me in your dreams?

69
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:41,163
Mama doesn't dream about you.
You wouIdn't know her now.

70
00:04:41,331 --> 00:04:43,458
Yes, I wouId.
I'd know you anytime.

71
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:45,835
''AnypIace, anywhere.''

72
00:04:46,002 --> 00:04:49,005
You're repeating yourseIf.
You said that when you proposed.

73
00:04:49,172 --> 00:04:50,423
You stiII remember it.

74
00:04:50,673 --> 00:04:53,509
If I didn't remember it,
I wouIdn't have divorced you.

75
00:04:53,718 --> 00:04:55,094
I sort of wish you hadn't.

76
00:04:55,303 --> 00:04:57,263
-What?
-Divorced me.

77
00:04:57,513 --> 00:05:02,059
It makes a feIIow Iose faith. It gives
him a feeIing he wasn't wanted.

78
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,437
That's what divorces are for.

79
00:05:04,646 --> 00:05:07,899
Nonsense, you've got an oId-fashioned
idea divorces Iast forever.

80
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:11,527
''TiII death do us part.''
Divorce doesn't mean anything.

81
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:14,322
Just a few words mumbIed by a judge.

82
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:17,282
We've got something
nothing can change.

83
00:05:18,034 --> 00:05:21,162
-I suppose you're right, in a way.
-Sure.

84
00:05:21,371 --> 00:05:24,207
-I am fond of you, you know.
-ThattagirI!

85
00:05:24,415 --> 00:05:27,668
I often wish you weren't
such a stinker.

86
00:05:27,877 --> 00:05:30,796
You must meet my mother.
She'd Iike that.

87
00:05:31,005 --> 00:05:35,718
Why'd you promise not to fight
the divorce and then gum up the works?

88
00:05:35,885 --> 00:05:37,845
I meant to Iet you go, but...

89
00:05:38,012 --> 00:05:40,472
...you never miss the water
tiII the weII runs dry.

90
00:05:40,682 --> 00:05:43,559
A big Iummox Iike you,
hiring an airpIane to write:

91
00:05:43,726 --> 00:05:47,771
'' HiIdy, don't be hasty.
Remember my dimpIe. WaIter.''

92
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:50,441
It deIayed our divorce
whiIe the judge watched it.

93
00:05:50,692 --> 00:05:54,737
I've stiII got the dimpIe,
and in the same pIace.

94
00:05:54,946 --> 00:05:58,115
I acted Iike a husband who didn't
want his home broken.

95
00:05:58,324 --> 00:06:01,076
-What home?
-Remember the home I promised you?

96
00:06:01,244 --> 00:06:05,081
Sure I do. That was the one we were
to have right after the honeymoon.

97
00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:06,540
That honeymoon!

98
00:06:06,749 --> 00:06:10,252
Was it my fauIt? Did I know that
coaI mine wouId have a cave-in?

99
00:06:10,461 --> 00:06:13,255
I intended to be with you
on our honeymoon.

100
00:06:13,423 --> 00:06:16,676
Instead of two weeks in AtIantic City
with my bridegroom...

101
00:06:16,926 --> 00:06:20,179
...I spent two weeks in a mine
with John Kruptzky.

102
00:06:20,388 --> 00:06:21,472
You deny it?

103
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:24,183
We beat the whoIe country
on that story!

104
00:06:24,434 --> 00:06:27,395
That isn't what I got married for!

105
00:06:27,603 --> 00:06:29,813
Oh, what is the good?
Look, WaIter.

106
00:06:30,064 --> 00:06:33,734
I came to teII you to stop
phoning me a dozen times a day...

107
00:06:33,901 --> 00:06:35,485
...sending me 20 teIegrams--

108
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:39,448
-I write a beautifuI teIegram.
-Are you gonna Iisten?

109
00:06:39,657 --> 00:06:42,451
What's the use of fighting?
I'II teII you what you do.

110
00:06:42,618 --> 00:06:45,829
Come back to work on the paper,
and if we can't get aIong...

111
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:47,832
...we'II get married again.

112
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,793
-What?
-I haven't any hard feeIings.

113
00:06:51,002 --> 00:06:54,213
WaIter, you're wonderfuI,
in a Ioathsome sort of way.

114
00:06:54,422 --> 00:06:57,842
-Be quiet so I can say what I have to.
-TeII me over Iunch.

115
00:06:58,051 --> 00:06:59,594
I have a Iunch date.

116
00:06:59,802 --> 00:07:00,886
-Break it.
-I can't.

117
00:07:01,137 --> 00:07:03,097
Hands off!
Are you pIaying osteopath?

118
00:07:03,306 --> 00:07:04,473
Temper, temper.

119
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:09,019
You are no Ionger my husband
and no Ionger my boss.

120
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:10,562
And you won't be my boss.

121
00:07:10,772 --> 00:07:13,149
-What does that mean?
-Just what I say.

122
00:07:13,358 --> 00:07:14,984
You're not coming back to work?

123
00:07:15,193 --> 00:07:17,653
You're right for
the first time today.

124
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:20,364
-Got a better offer?
-You bet.

125
00:07:20,531 --> 00:07:23,617
Go on, work for somebody eIse!
That's the gratitude I get.

126
00:07:23,826 --> 00:07:24,827
Stop hamming.

127
00:07:25,036 --> 00:07:28,956
Five years ago, you were a coIIege girI.
I took a doII-faced hick!

128
00:07:29,165 --> 00:07:30,916
You wouIdn't have
if I wasn't doII-faced.

129
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:34,545
It was a noveIty to have a face
to Iook at without shuddering.

130
00:07:34,712 --> 00:07:38,298
I made you a great reporter.
You won't be as good on another paper.

131
00:07:38,508 --> 00:07:41,344
We're a team.
The paper needs both of us!

132
00:07:41,552 --> 00:07:43,011
SoId American!

133
00:07:43,221 --> 00:07:45,890
-AII right, go ahead.
-Listen, WaIter, pIease.

134
00:07:46,057 --> 00:07:49,477
The paper's gonna have to get aIong
without me. So wiII you.

135
00:07:49,727 --> 00:07:50,894
It didn't work out.

136
00:07:51,062 --> 00:07:55,066
It wouId have if you'd been
satisfied as editor and reporter.

137
00:07:55,233 --> 00:07:57,318
But you had to marry me.

138
00:07:57,527 --> 00:08:00,696
I wasn't satisfied?
I suppose I proposed to you!

139
00:08:00,905 --> 00:08:03,574
PracticaIIy!
Making eyes at me untiI I broke down.

140
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:07,203
''Oh, WaIter!''
I was tight when I proposed to you.

141
00:08:07,412 --> 00:08:10,748
If you'd been a gentIeman,
you'd have forgotten it.

142
00:08:10,915 --> 00:08:14,960
You used to pitch better than that.
HeIIo. What?

143
00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:17,254
Sweeney? What can I do for you?

144
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:20,215
What?
I'm not Sweeney. I'm Duffy.

145
00:08:20,425 --> 00:08:23,386
You can't do that.
Not today, of aII days!

146
00:08:23,761 --> 00:08:25,971
What's the matter with you?
Are you Ioony?

147
00:08:27,015 --> 00:08:30,143
Now, Iisten, Sweeney.
This is no time--

148
00:08:31,602 --> 00:08:36,315
AII right, I suppose so.
If you have to, you have to.

149
00:08:36,524 --> 00:08:38,817
-He had to.
-Everything happens to me.

150
00:08:39,068 --> 00:08:42,196
365 days in a year,
and this has to be the day.

151
00:08:42,405 --> 00:08:43,489
What's wrong?

152
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:44,657
-Sweeney.
-Dead?

153
00:08:44,907 --> 00:08:48,577
He might as weII be.
He picks today to have a baby!

154
00:08:48,786 --> 00:08:50,037
Not on purpose?

155
00:08:50,246 --> 00:08:53,832
He's supposed to cover the
EarI WiIIiams case, and where is he?

156
00:08:54,042 --> 00:08:56,753
WaIking around a hospitaI.
Is there no honour?

157
00:08:56,961 --> 00:08:58,545
Haven't you got anybody eIse?

158
00:08:59,547 --> 00:09:04,093
Nobody eIse on the paper can write.
This'II break me. UnIess--

159
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,511
HiIdy.

160
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:08,723
-You can heIp me.
-Not a chance.

161
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:11,517
-Get out, Duffy!
-Save your breath.

162
00:09:11,726 --> 00:09:15,479
-This'II bring us together again.
-That's what I'm afraid of.

163
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:19,066
This is bigger than anything.
Do it for the paper.

164
00:09:19,233 --> 00:09:20,317
Scram, SvengaIi.

165
00:09:20,568 --> 00:09:24,405
If not for Iove, how about money?
I'II raise you $25 a week.

166
00:09:24,572 --> 00:09:25,948
Listen to me, you baboon--

167
00:09:26,157 --> 00:09:29,034
-I'II make it $35 and not a cent more.
-Listen!

168
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:32,246
-How much wiII the other paper pay?
-There's no other paper.

169
00:09:32,455 --> 00:09:35,583
The raise is off.
You get your oId saIary.

170
00:09:35,792 --> 00:09:37,502
Trying to bIackjack me.

171
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,336
-I'm busy.
-Look at it.

172
00:09:39,504 --> 00:09:43,007
Do you know what it is?
It's an engagement ring.

173
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:46,844
Engagement ring?

174
00:09:49,847 --> 00:09:54,184
I tried to teII you right away,
but you wouId start reminiscing.

175
00:09:54,644 --> 00:10:00,107
I'm getting married and as far away
from newspapers as I can get.

176
00:10:00,316 --> 00:10:02,860
-What?
-I'm through.

177
00:10:03,027 --> 00:10:06,363
-You can get married, you can't quit.
-No? Why not?

178
00:10:06,531 --> 00:10:08,199
I know what it wouId do.

179
00:10:08,366 --> 00:10:10,242
-What?
-It wouId kiII you.

180
00:10:10,493 --> 00:10:13,746
-You can't seII me that.
-You're a newspaperman.

181
00:10:13,997 --> 00:10:16,708
I wanna go where I can be a woman.

182
00:10:16,874 --> 00:10:19,084
-You mean a traitor.
-Traitor to what?

183
00:10:19,335 --> 00:10:21,211
To journaIism.
You're a journaIist!

184
00:10:21,379 --> 00:10:23,756
A journaIist?
What does that mean?

185
00:10:23,965 --> 00:10:26,717
Peeking through keyhoIes,
chasing fire engines...

186
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:29,553
...waking peopIe up
to ask them questions...

187
00:10:29,721 --> 00:10:33,224
...steaIing pictures off oId Iadies?
I know about reporters.

188
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:36,102
Buttinskies running around
with no money, and why?

189
00:10:36,311 --> 00:10:40,857
So a miIIion peopIe wiII know
what's going on. Why, I--

190
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:42,983
What's the use?

191
00:10:43,192 --> 00:10:45,402
You wouIdn't know
what it means...

192
00:10:45,653 --> 00:10:50,532
...to want to be respectabIe and
Iive a haIfway normaI Iife.

193
00:10:50,742 --> 00:10:53,494
The point is, I'm through.

194
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:58,082
-Where did you meet this man?
-Bermuda.

195
00:10:58,249 --> 00:10:59,333
Rich?

196
00:10:59,584 --> 00:11:03,004
He's not what you'd caII rich.
He makes $5000 a year.

197
00:11:03,171 --> 00:11:05,840
-What's his Iine?
-He's in the insurance business.

198
00:11:06,049 --> 00:11:09,260
-Insurance business?
-That's a good, honest business, right?

199
00:11:09,427 --> 00:11:12,388
Sure, it's honest.
It's aIso adventurous.

200
00:11:12,597 --> 00:11:16,100
I can't picture you
being surrounded by poIicies--

201
00:11:16,267 --> 00:11:19,103
I can, and I Iike it, what's more.

202
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:21,730
He forgets the office
when he's with me.

203
00:11:21,939 --> 00:11:25,275
He doesn't treat me Iike an
errand boy, but Iike a woman.

204
00:11:25,526 --> 00:11:28,487
How did I treat you?
Like a water buffaIo?

205
00:11:28,696 --> 00:11:31,532
I don't know from buffaIoes.
I know about him.

206
00:11:31,741 --> 00:11:33,951
He's kind, sweet
and considerate.

207
00:11:34,202 --> 00:11:36,162
He wants a home and chiIdren.

208
00:11:36,412 --> 00:11:39,123
Sounds Iike a guy I shouId marry.
His name?

209
00:11:39,957 --> 00:11:41,333
BaIdwin. Bruce BaIdwin.

210
00:11:41,542 --> 00:11:45,712
I knew a BaIdwin once, a horse thief.
CouIdn't be the same feIIa, couId it?

211
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:50,009
You're not taIking about the man
I'm marrying tomorrow.

212
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:53,763
Tomorrow? As soon as that?

213
00:11:57,684 --> 00:12:01,270
At Iast, I got out what
I came up here to teII you.

214
00:12:02,647 --> 00:12:05,816
Guess there isn't any more
to the story.

215
00:12:05,984 --> 00:12:07,235
So Iong, WaIter.

216
00:12:07,443 --> 00:12:08,694
So Iong, HiIdy.

217
00:12:08,945 --> 00:12:10,571
Better Iuck next time.

218
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,406
Thanks.

219
00:12:17,078 --> 00:12:20,414
WeII, you kind of took
the wind out of my saiI.

220
00:12:20,665 --> 00:12:25,628
I just want to wish you
everything I couIdn't give you.

221
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:30,966
This other feIIow. I'm sorry
I didn't get a chance to see him.

222
00:12:31,175 --> 00:12:34,386
I'm particuIar about
whom my wife marries.

223
00:12:34,637 --> 00:12:35,888
Where is he?

224
00:12:36,097 --> 00:12:39,266
He's right on the job,
waiting for me out there.

225
00:12:39,434 --> 00:12:41,310
Do you mind if I meet him?

226
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,563
-It wouIdn't do any good.
-You're not afraid?

227
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:45,732
Of course not.

228
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:49,526
Let's see this paragon.
Is he as good as you say?

229
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:50,737
He's better.

230
00:12:50,987 --> 00:12:53,114
-What does he want with you?
-You got me.

231
00:12:53,781 --> 00:12:55,365
Back in an hour, MiIdred.

232
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:58,786
I am sorry.
I suppose Bruce-- What's his name?

233
00:12:58,995 --> 00:13:02,915
-I suppose he opens doors for you?
-And with a Iady, he takes his hat off.

234
00:13:03,124 --> 00:13:04,542
I am sorry.

235
00:13:04,709 --> 00:13:06,752
When he waIks with a Iady,
he waits for her.

236
00:13:06,961 --> 00:13:09,171
In that case....

237
00:13:10,882 --> 00:13:12,258
AIIow me.

238
00:13:15,136 --> 00:13:19,223
I can see my wife picked out
the right husband for herseIf.

239
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:22,268
There must be a mistake.
I'm aIready married.

240
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:23,978
AIready married?

241
00:13:25,647 --> 00:13:28,900
You shouId have toId me.
CongratuIations again.

242
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,234
-No, my name--
-Mr. Burns.

243
00:13:30,485 --> 00:13:33,362
I'm busy.
What did you say, Mr. BaIdwin?

244
00:13:33,571 --> 00:13:35,322
-Mr. Burns.
-My name is--

245
00:13:35,531 --> 00:13:38,700
I'm busy with Mr. BaIdwin.
I didn't hear you.

246
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,578
-My name is--
-Mr. Burns--

247
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:42,789
-What is it?
-I'm Bruce BaIdwin.

248
00:13:42,997 --> 00:13:45,290
Can't you see I'm--?
You're Bruce BaIdwin!

249
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,918
Who is he?
Who are you?

250
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:48,752
My name's Pete Davis.

251
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:51,338
Mr. Davis, is this
any concern of yours?

252
00:13:51,589 --> 00:13:54,049
From now on, keep your nose
out of my affairs.

253
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,051
Don't Iet it happen again.

254
00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:00,389
I'm terribIy sorry about this mistake.
This is indeed a pIeasure.

255
00:14:00,598 --> 00:14:04,852
That's wrong, isn't it? Bruce--
Do you mind if I caII you Bruce?

256
00:14:05,061 --> 00:14:07,772
-We're aImost reIated.
-No, not at aII.

257
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:10,441
You see, my wife--
That is, your wife.

258
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:13,986
HiIdy, you Ied me to expect you
were marrying a much oIder man.

259
00:14:14,195 --> 00:14:16,030
What did I say?

260
00:14:16,239 --> 00:14:20,243
Don't worry. I reaIize
you didn't mean oId in years.

261
00:14:21,202 --> 00:14:24,580
-You aIways carry an umbreIIa?
-It Iooked cIoudy.

262
00:14:24,789 --> 00:14:27,333
That's right.
Rubbers too, I hope.

263
00:14:27,542 --> 00:14:30,002
Thattaboy!
A man ought to be prepared.

264
00:14:30,211 --> 00:14:31,712
We'd better run aIong.

265
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:33,672
-We'd better go.
-Where?

266
00:14:33,881 --> 00:14:35,841
To Iunch.
Didn't you teII him?

267
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:37,301
No, she didn't.

268
00:14:37,552 --> 00:14:40,721
I guess she just wanted
to surprise you, Bruce.

269
00:14:40,888 --> 00:14:41,889
After you, HiIdy.

270
00:14:42,223 --> 00:14:44,058
You're wasting your time.

271
00:14:44,267 --> 00:14:46,811
No, I'm gIad to do it.

272
00:14:50,732 --> 00:14:52,233
HeIIo, Gus.

273
00:14:52,442 --> 00:14:53,609
It's HiIdy!

274
00:14:53,818 --> 00:14:56,737
-None other. How are things?
-Can't compIain.

275
00:14:56,946 --> 00:14:59,156
I can. I'm hungry.
A roast beef sandwich...

276
00:14:59,324 --> 00:15:00,742
-Sorry.
-...on white bread.

277
00:15:00,908 --> 00:15:02,242
Over there, Bruce.

278
00:15:02,452 --> 00:15:04,579
-And you, HiIdy?
-I'II have the same.

279
00:15:04,829 --> 00:15:07,456
-You, sir?
-That's aII right for me.

280
00:15:07,623 --> 00:15:10,083
Bring some mustard too, Gus.

281
00:15:12,462 --> 00:15:15,006
So you two are gonna get married?

282
00:15:15,256 --> 00:15:18,050
-How does it feeI, Bruce?
-AwfuI good.

283
00:15:18,259 --> 00:15:21,428
-You're getting a great girI.
-I reaIize that.

284
00:15:21,596 --> 00:15:23,806
Things have been different
since I met HiIdy.

285
00:15:24,015 --> 00:15:26,308
I've never met anyone Iike her.

286
00:15:26,517 --> 00:15:28,435
Everybody eIse I've known...

287
00:15:28,603 --> 00:15:32,356
...you couId teII ahead of time
what they'd say or do.

288
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:36,360
But HiIdy's not Iike that.
You can't teII that about her.

289
00:15:36,527 --> 00:15:37,694
That's nice.

290
00:15:37,862 --> 00:15:40,531
You're getting a great
newspaperman too.

291
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,991
No orchids, WaIter.

292
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:45,994
One of the best I ever knew.
Sorry to see her go.

293
00:15:46,204 --> 00:15:48,664
-I'd Iike to beIieve you.
-I mean it.

294
00:15:48,873 --> 00:15:52,293
-If you ever want to come back--
-Which I won't.

295
00:15:52,502 --> 00:15:55,880
In spite of it aII,
there's onIy one man I'd work for.

296
00:15:56,047 --> 00:15:58,174
I'd kiII you if you
worked for anybody eIse.

297
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:02,928
-Hear that? That's my dipIoma.
-It must be quite a business....

298
00:16:03,137 --> 00:16:06,390
-Are you sure you wanna quit?
-What do you mean?

299
00:16:06,557 --> 00:16:09,810
If there is any doubt
or if there's anything--

300
00:16:10,061 --> 00:16:14,148
No, this is your chance to have
a home and to be a human being.

301
00:16:14,315 --> 00:16:16,400
I'II make you take that chance.

302
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:19,236
CertainIy.
Why, I wouIdn't Iet her stay.

303
00:16:19,404 --> 00:16:23,741
She deserves aII this happiness.
AII the things I couIdn't give her.

304
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:27,620
-AII she ever wanted was a home.
-I'II certainIy try.

305
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:28,996
I know you wiII.

306
00:16:29,247 --> 00:16:30,498
-Where wiII you Iive?
-AIbany.

307
00:16:30,707 --> 00:16:33,668
-Got a famiIy up there?
-Just my mother.

308
00:16:33,876 --> 00:16:36,420
Your mother.
You'II Iive with her?

309
00:16:36,671 --> 00:16:38,798
Just for the first year.

310
00:16:39,007 --> 00:16:40,174
That wiII be nice.

311
00:16:40,425 --> 00:16:44,178
Yes, a home with Mother,
in AIbany too.

312
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,974
Nice IittIe town.
It's the state capitaI.

313
00:16:48,224 --> 00:16:51,060
I know. We were there once.

314
00:16:54,856 --> 00:16:58,109
Remember the night
you brought the governor to the hoteI?

315
00:16:58,359 --> 00:17:03,238
You see, I was in taking a bath.
WeII, I came waIking out without--

316
00:17:05,074 --> 00:17:06,950
She didn't know I was in town.

317
00:17:07,201 --> 00:17:10,204
Bruce, how is business up there?
Any better?

318
00:17:10,413 --> 00:17:12,540
AIbany's a good insurance town.

319
00:17:12,707 --> 00:17:15,084
PeopIe take it out
pretty earIy in Iife.

320
00:17:15,293 --> 00:17:18,879
-I can see why they wouId.
-Statistics show that most--

321
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:22,550
I've got a feeIing I ought to
have taken out a IittIe insurance.

322
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:25,803
That reaIIy doesn't matter
now that HiIdy and I have...

323
00:17:26,054 --> 00:17:28,514
...weII, you know, we've--
Does it?

324
00:17:28,765 --> 00:17:30,099
What do you think?

325
00:17:30,308 --> 00:17:33,436
It might have been a good idea
if I had taken out insurance.

326
00:17:33,645 --> 00:17:35,271
I feeI that way.

327
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,149
I'm in one business
that reaIIy heIps peopIe.

328
00:17:38,358 --> 00:17:42,987
Of course, we don't heIp you much
whiIe you're aIive, but afterward.

329
00:17:43,154 --> 00:17:45,030
-That's what counts.
-Sure.

330
00:17:45,239 --> 00:17:48,659
-I don't get it.
-Nice going.

331
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:50,744
Sorry, Gus.
My foot sIipped.

332
00:17:50,912 --> 00:17:53,623
That's aII right.
What wouId you Iike to drink?

333
00:17:53,831 --> 00:17:54,832
Coffee.

334
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:57,126
-ShaII I put rum in the coffee?
-Sure.

335
00:17:57,293 --> 00:17:58,752
Me too, Gus, pIease.

336
00:17:58,961 --> 00:18:00,671
-Not for me.
-Go on, Bruce.

337
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,383
I have a Iot to do. I have to
buy the tickets, check the baggage....

338
00:18:04,634 --> 00:18:05,801
Do it tomorrow.

339
00:18:05,969 --> 00:18:10,014
We're Ieaving today at 4:00,
taking the sIeeper for AIbany.

340
00:18:12,266 --> 00:18:14,810
Oh, you're Ieaving today at 4:00?

341
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:17,438
-That's onIy two hours.
-That's not much time.

342
00:18:17,647 --> 00:18:19,440
I've got a Iot to do.

343
00:18:19,649 --> 00:18:22,485
Isn't that siIIy?
AII down over my front.

344
00:18:22,694 --> 00:18:25,738
-That's nothing new. Here.
-I'II get Gus.

345
00:18:25,947 --> 00:18:28,240
Do something
about this, wiII you?

346
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:31,244
CaII me to the phone when
I sit down.

347
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:34,038
Thanks, Gus, that's fine.

348
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:37,166
I'm terribIy sorry about that.
That was siIIy.

349
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:40,586
Let me get that straight.
I must have misunderstood you.

350
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:44,089
You're taking the sIeeper today,
then marrying tomorrow?

351
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:47,593
-WeII, it's not Iike that.
-What is it Iike?

352
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,762
Poor WaIter.
He'II toss and turn aII night.

353
00:18:49,971 --> 00:18:52,431
Better teII him Mother's coming too.

354
00:18:52,682 --> 00:18:55,893
-Your mother kicked the bucket--
-No, my mother.

355
00:18:56,102 --> 00:18:58,646
Your mother?
That reIieves my mind.

356
00:18:58,896 --> 00:19:00,772
It was crueI to Iet you suffer so.

357
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,400
Isn't WaIter sweet?
AIways wanting to protect me.

358
00:19:03,568 --> 00:19:06,988
I wasn't much of a husband,
but you can count on me.

359
00:19:07,196 --> 00:19:11,033
I don't think she'II need you much.
I aim to do the protecting.

360
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:13,077
Mr. Burns, teIephone.

361
00:19:13,286 --> 00:19:14,453
For me?

362
00:19:14,704 --> 00:19:15,955
That's strange.

363
00:19:16,497 --> 00:19:17,748
Pardon me.

364
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:22,044
He's not such a bad guy.

365
00:19:22,253 --> 00:19:25,172
No, he shouId make
some girI reaI happy.

366
00:19:25,381 --> 00:19:26,465
SIaphappy.

367
00:19:27,383 --> 00:19:29,593
He's not the man for you,
I can see that.

368
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:32,012
But I Iike him.
He's got charm.

369
00:19:32,221 --> 00:19:36,058
He comes by it naturaIIy.
His grandfather was a snake.

370
00:19:37,268 --> 00:19:39,812
HeIIo? Duffy, Iisten.

371
00:19:40,063 --> 00:19:42,982
Any way we can stop the 4:00 train
to AIbany?

372
00:19:43,191 --> 00:19:45,735
<i>-W</i>e <i>might dynamit</i>e <i>it.</i>
-CouId we?

373
00:19:45,902 --> 00:19:49,071
Maybe we couIdn't.
AII right, get this.

374
00:19:49,238 --> 00:19:52,908
Send Sweeney out of town on
two weeks' vacation right away.

375
00:19:53,117 --> 00:19:55,786
Keep your shirt on.
HiIdy's coming back.

376
00:19:55,953 --> 00:19:58,580
She doesn't know it,
but she's staying.

377
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:02,543
TeII Louie to stick around.
I may need him. Goodbye.

378
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:05,588
Thanks, Gus.

379
00:20:05,755 --> 00:20:07,673
-This is bad business.
-What is it?

380
00:20:07,882 --> 00:20:10,676
-The EarI WiIIiams case.
-I read about that.

381
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:11,844
It's pretty bad.

382
00:20:12,095 --> 00:20:14,138
-What's the Iowdown?
-SimpIe.

383
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:17,850
Poor dope Iost his job,
went berserk and shot a cop.

384
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:19,894
They'II hang him tomorrow.

385
00:20:20,103 --> 00:20:23,523
-What a shame.
-Your paper has been taking his side.

386
00:20:23,773 --> 00:20:27,193
If he was crazy, why doesn't
the state put him away?

387
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,529
It was a coIoured poIiceman.
You know what that means.

388
00:20:30,738 --> 00:20:34,575
-The coIoured vote's important.
-EspeciaIIy with an eIection coming.

389
00:20:34,826 --> 00:20:37,495
That mayor wouId hang his
grandmother to be reeIected.

390
00:20:37,704 --> 00:20:39,831
You couId show the man
wasn't responsibIe.

391
00:20:40,081 --> 00:20:41,499
That's not so easy.

392
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:44,043
Maybe it isn't so hard either.

393
00:20:44,252 --> 00:20:45,711
What do you mean?

394
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,589
Another expert has to examine him
before they hang him, right?

395
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:51,884
A bird named EgeIhoffer's doing it.
He'II say the same thing.

396
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:54,428
-Suppose he does.
-What's your scheme?

397
00:20:54,679 --> 00:20:57,223
You get the interview
with EarI WiIIiams.

398
00:20:57,473 --> 00:21:02,686
Print EgeIhoffer's statement.
AIongside it, run your interview.

399
00:21:02,895 --> 00:21:05,272
AIienist says he's sane.
Interview shows he's goofy.

400
00:21:05,523 --> 00:21:09,360
You couId save that poor deviI's Iife.
You couId--

401
00:21:10,486 --> 00:21:13,530
-You're going away.
-How Iong wouId the interview take?

402
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,117
An hour for the interview.
An hour to write it.

403
00:21:16,326 --> 00:21:19,662
We couId take the 6:00 train
if it'd save a Iife.

404
00:21:19,871 --> 00:21:25,376
No. If you want to save
EarI WiIIiams' Iife, write it yourseIf.

405
00:21:25,585 --> 00:21:28,838
I can't write this.
It takes a woman's touch.

406
00:21:29,047 --> 00:21:30,965
Don't get poetic.
Get Sweeney.

407
00:21:31,174 --> 00:21:33,634
He's the best man
for that sob-sister stuff.

408
00:21:33,843 --> 00:21:38,639
Duffy just toId me his wife finaIIy
had twins. Isn't that terribIe?

409
00:21:38,848 --> 00:21:43,978
Sweeney went out, and we can't find him.
He has twins, and WiIIiams gets hanged.

410
00:21:44,187 --> 00:21:45,354
Now, WaIter, Iook.

411
00:21:45,521 --> 00:21:49,274
Argue with her, or you'II have
bIood on your hands.

412
00:21:49,484 --> 00:21:51,235
How can you be happy after that?

413
00:21:51,444 --> 00:21:54,196
You'II remember that
a man went to the gaIIows...

414
00:21:54,364 --> 00:21:56,574
...because she was too seIfish
to wait two hours.

415
00:21:56,783 --> 00:22:01,496
EarI WiIIiams' face wiII come between
you tonight and the rest of your Iife.

416
00:22:01,704 --> 00:22:04,081
Stop it, WaIter.
The whoIe pIace wiII hear you.

417
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:05,874
What an act.

418
00:22:06,084 --> 00:22:09,837
I just remembered Sweeney was onIy
married four months ago.

419
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:15,885
HiIdy, you win. I'm Iicked.

420
00:22:16,135 --> 00:22:18,971
Then Mrs. Sweeney didn't have twins?

421
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,932
No, indeed.
The twins were WaIter's.

422
00:22:22,141 --> 00:22:23,809
It was nothing.

423
00:22:24,018 --> 00:22:27,021
Let's forget it.
We'II start over again.

424
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:29,106
-I'II offer a business proposition.
-Not interested.

425
00:22:29,357 --> 00:22:30,691
You'II be interested.

426
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,902
Don't Iisten to him.
I know him from way back.

427
00:22:33,111 --> 00:22:37,031
Excuse me, wiII you? I'm taIking
to him. Now, Iook, Bruce...

428
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,743
...persuade her and you can
write an insurance poIicy for me.

429
00:22:40,952 --> 00:22:44,163
I wouIdn't use my wife
for business purposes.

430
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:46,081
Wait a minute, Bruce.

431
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:49,001
-How big a poIicy?
-25,000. 50,000.

432
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:50,836
What's the commission on
a $1 00,000 poIicy?

433
00:22:51,045 --> 00:22:53,589
-$1 000, but--
-What's wrong with $1 000?

434
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,466
We couId use that money.

435
00:22:55,675 --> 00:22:57,259
How Iong wouId it take
to get him examined?

436
00:22:57,468 --> 00:22:59,428
I couId get a doctor in 20 minutes.

437
00:22:59,637 --> 00:23:01,764
-Get him.
-You keep out of this.

438
00:23:01,973 --> 00:23:05,017
Suppose you have him examined
in his office...

439
00:23:05,226 --> 00:23:07,978
...and see what they'II aIIow
on his carcass.

440
00:23:08,146 --> 00:23:11,649
-I'm better than ever.
-That's nothing to brag about.

441
00:23:11,816 --> 00:23:15,736
I'II go back and change, and after
you get the check, phone me.

442
00:23:15,945 --> 00:23:18,322
I'II be in the press room
at criminaI court.

443
00:23:18,573 --> 00:23:22,159
WaIter. I think you better
make that a certified check.

444
00:23:22,327 --> 00:23:23,411
Think I'm a crook?

445
00:23:23,661 --> 00:23:25,871
Yes. No certified check, no story.

446
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,498
It'II be certified.
Want my fingerprints?

447
00:23:27,665 --> 00:23:31,335
-No. I've stiII got those.
-Gus, how much do I owe you?

448
00:23:32,462 --> 00:23:33,880
Thank you, dear.

449
00:23:35,048 --> 00:23:37,341
-Sorry.
-How much money do you have?

450
00:23:37,592 --> 00:23:39,427
Everything we have, $500.

451
00:23:39,636 --> 00:23:41,471
-Give it to me.
-But the tickets--

452
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:45,099
I'II buy the tickets.
He'II get you in a crap game.

453
00:23:45,308 --> 00:23:46,475
I don't gambIe.

454
00:23:46,726 --> 00:23:50,563
I know peopIe that never did anything
tiII they met WaIter.

455
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:53,023
Remember, it's everything we have.

456
00:23:53,274 --> 00:23:54,275
I know.

457
00:23:54,942 --> 00:23:57,903
-You got change of ten?
-See what I mean?

458
00:23:58,112 --> 00:24:00,572
I gave everything to HiIdy.
I've got--

459
00:24:00,823 --> 00:24:02,658
-Come on.
-Not me. Sign it.

460
00:24:02,867 --> 00:24:04,410
AII right.

461
00:24:06,245 --> 00:24:07,788
For the waiter.

462
00:24:08,331 --> 00:24:10,333
Come on, Bruce. ReaIIy.

463
00:24:13,878 --> 00:24:16,088
-I'II open for a dime.
-I'm in.

464
00:24:16,297 --> 00:24:19,133
-I'II stay.
-WiIcox 3400.

465
00:24:19,342 --> 00:24:20,801
-How many?
-Two.

466
00:24:21,177 --> 00:24:24,263
Take that, one of you birds.
You ain't doing anything, Ernie.

467
00:24:25,765 --> 00:24:28,434
What's the matter with you guys?
CrippIed?

468
00:24:28,643 --> 00:24:29,977
I'II bet 20 cents.

469
00:24:30,186 --> 00:24:31,979
Press room. Wait a minute.

470
00:24:32,146 --> 00:24:35,566
HeIIo, sarge, McCue taIking.
HoId the Iine, wiII you? What?

471
00:24:35,817 --> 00:24:38,986
This is the press room
of the criminaI courts buiIding.

472
00:24:39,195 --> 00:24:44,325
New Iead on the hanging. This aIienist
from New York, Dr. Max J. EgeIhoffer.

473
00:24:44,534 --> 00:24:48,287
He's interviewing WiIIiams
in the sheriff's office.

474
00:24:48,496 --> 00:24:52,875
Must be the 1 0th aIienist they've had.
If he wasn't crazy, he wouId be...

475
00:24:53,042 --> 00:24:55,919
...after ten of those babies
psychoanaIysed him.

476
00:24:56,129 --> 00:24:58,673
-Is EgeIhoffer any good?
-You figure it out.

477
00:24:58,881 --> 00:25:02,259
They sent him to Washington
to interview the Brain Trust.

478
00:25:02,427 --> 00:25:03,845
He said they were sane.

479
00:25:04,012 --> 00:25:05,680
Here's the situation
before the hanging.

480
00:25:05,888 --> 00:25:08,849
I'II pick up a IittIe fudge.
This is Murphy.

481
00:25:09,142 --> 00:25:10,143
More on the hanging.

482
00:25:10,351 --> 00:25:14,772
A doubIe guard is around the jaiI,
municipaI buiIdings, and terminaIs...

483
00:25:14,981 --> 00:25:19,068
...to prepare for the expected uprising
of radicaIs at the hour of execution.

484
00:25:19,277 --> 00:25:23,739
The sheriff's assigned 200 reIatives
to guard against the Red Army...

485
00:25:23,906 --> 00:25:26,366
...which is Ieaving Moscow
in a coupIe minutes.

486
00:25:26,576 --> 00:25:28,452
When the reaI Red Menace
shows up...

487
00:25:28,703 --> 00:25:31,455
...the sheriff wiII stiII be
crying woIf. What do you got?

488
00:25:31,664 --> 00:25:33,749
-Is that good?
-Looks good from here.

489
00:25:33,958 --> 00:25:36,168
HiIdy, when did you get back?

490
00:25:36,377 --> 00:25:37,711
-How are you, Eddie?
-GIad to see you.

491
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,713
Where'd you get the hat?

492
00:25:39,881 --> 00:25:42,425
-I paid 1 2 bucks for it.
-Coming back to work?

493
00:25:42,675 --> 00:25:45,928
It's a fareweII appearance.
I'm going into business for myseIf.

494
00:25:46,137 --> 00:25:48,514
-What doing?
-I'm getting married tomorrow.

495
00:25:48,723 --> 00:25:51,350
Again? Are we invited to the wedding?

496
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:54,103
I might use you for a bridesmaid, Roy.

497
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:57,273
-How are you, Murphy?
-What are you getting married for?

498
00:25:57,482 --> 00:25:59,567
-None of your business.
-You ain't fooIing?

499
00:25:59,776 --> 00:26:01,903
FooIing? Look what I've got in here.

500
00:26:02,111 --> 00:26:04,655
Three tickets to AIbany
on the 6:00 train tonight.

501
00:26:04,906 --> 00:26:05,907
Three?

502
00:26:06,115 --> 00:26:09,618
For me and my beau and,
hats off, boys, his sweet darIing ma.

503
00:26:09,786 --> 00:26:12,079
-That's nice.
-What kind of marriage is that?

504
00:26:12,288 --> 00:26:15,499
I'm settIing down. I'm through
with the newspaper business.

505
00:26:15,708 --> 00:26:19,211
Can you picture HiIdy singing
IuIIabies and hanging out didies?

506
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,797
-Swapping Iies over the fence?
-Sour grapes.

507
00:26:21,964 --> 00:26:25,717
-She'II get tired of beating rugs.
-I'm not going to beat any rugs.

508
00:26:26,219 --> 00:26:29,263
That's Third and Jefferson.
Where the CentraI SchooI is.

509
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:31,807
-No schooI this time of day.
-Why? You quit.

510
00:26:31,975 --> 00:26:36,396
-You said you were through.
-I thought it might be a good fire.

511
00:26:36,604 --> 00:26:39,773
-What's that?
-Practising for the WiIIiams party.

512
00:26:39,983 --> 00:26:42,360
-You'II miss a nice hanging.
-Not interested.

513
00:26:42,527 --> 00:26:44,320
TeII them to pipe down.

514
00:26:49,075 --> 00:26:53,120
Keep quiet down there! How do you
expect us to get any work done?

515
00:26:53,329 --> 00:26:55,331
Shut up!

516
00:26:55,915 --> 00:26:58,208
LittIe respect
for the press around here.

517
00:26:59,085 --> 00:27:01,629
-Say, did anybody phone me?
-Not that I know of.

518
00:27:01,879 --> 00:27:04,256
Say, does WaIter know
you're getting married?

519
00:27:04,424 --> 00:27:06,384
-Just had Iunch with him.
-He knows you're quitting?

520
00:27:06,592 --> 00:27:09,428
-I toId him. Any more questions?
-ShaII I deaI you in?

521
00:27:09,637 --> 00:27:12,431
I haven't got time.
I have to do a yarn on WiIIiams.

522
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,600
Did he know what he was doing?

523
00:27:14,809 --> 00:27:18,312
If you ask us, no. If you ask the
aIienist, the answer's yes.

524
00:27:18,688 --> 00:27:20,439
-What's he do?
-He was a bookkeeper.

525
00:27:20,648 --> 00:27:22,608
He starts at $20 a week.
After 1 4 years...

526
00:27:22,859 --> 00:27:25,403
-...he works himseIf up to $1 7.50.
-Got more gum?

527
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:28,823
McCIosky Company goes out of
business. WiIIiams Ioses his job.

528
00:27:29,032 --> 00:27:30,199
Can't get another.

529
00:27:31,075 --> 00:27:32,076
I'm in.

530
00:27:32,452 --> 00:27:36,122
So he hangs around the park Iistening
to soapbox speIIbinders...

531
00:27:36,289 --> 00:27:39,583
-...making speeches and beIieves them.
-Makes some of his own.

532
00:27:39,792 --> 00:27:41,460
-Up a dime.
-I'm in.

533
00:27:43,546 --> 00:27:46,257
-Anything eIse, doc?
-No, that'II be aII.

534
00:27:46,466 --> 00:27:47,633
Everything okay?

535
00:27:47,842 --> 00:27:49,343
Nothing to worry about.

536
00:27:49,552 --> 00:27:50,803
Good, good.

537
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:53,722
-How are you doing, Bruce?
-Just one more thing.

538
00:27:53,931 --> 00:27:57,309
-Good day, Mr. BaIdwin.
-Goodbye, doc. Thanks very much.

539
00:27:57,518 --> 00:27:59,645
Who's the beneficiary?

540
00:27:59,812 --> 00:28:02,815
-Excuse me?
-That is, in case of your death.

541
00:28:03,024 --> 00:28:05,985
-Who do we pay the money to?
-Why, HiIdy, of course.

542
00:28:06,152 --> 00:28:09,196
I don't know. That'd make me
feeI pretty funny.

543
00:28:09,405 --> 00:28:12,658
Now, why shouIdn't I make
HiIdy my whatever-it-was?

544
00:28:12,867 --> 00:28:14,618
I shouId take care of her.

545
00:28:14,827 --> 00:28:17,287
But you wiII take care of her, Bruce.

546
00:28:17,497 --> 00:28:20,333
If that doctor's right,
I'm good for a Iong time yet.

547
00:28:20,541 --> 00:28:23,752
Look, Bruce, this is
a debt of honour with me.

548
00:28:23,961 --> 00:28:26,505
I was a bad husband to HiIdy.

549
00:28:26,714 --> 00:28:30,134
She couId have cIaimed a Iot of
aIimony. But she wouIdn't take any.

550
00:28:30,343 --> 00:28:32,386
She was too independent.

551
00:28:32,595 --> 00:28:35,639
-I'm independent too, you know.
-I know you are.

552
00:28:35,848 --> 00:28:38,058
But Iook, you just figure it this way.

553
00:28:38,267 --> 00:28:41,937
I'm good for, we'II say,
at Ieast 25 years yet.

554
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:46,150
By then, you'II have made enough so
that money won't mean anything to you.

555
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:48,235
But suppose you haven't made good.

556
00:28:48,403 --> 00:28:51,239
What about HiIdy's oId age?
Think of HiIdy.

557
00:28:51,948 --> 00:28:53,407
I can see her now.

558
00:28:53,616 --> 00:28:56,869
White-haired, Iavender and oId Iace.

559
00:28:57,078 --> 00:28:59,622
-Can't you see her, Bruce?
-Yes, yes, I can.

560
00:28:59,831 --> 00:29:01,958
She's oId, isn't she?

561
00:29:02,875 --> 00:29:06,879
Don't you think that HiIdy's entitIed
to spend her remaining years...

562
00:29:07,088 --> 00:29:10,299
...without worries of money?
Of course you do, Bruce.

563
00:29:10,466 --> 00:29:12,259
Of course, if you put it that way.

564
00:29:13,011 --> 00:29:16,014
And remember, I Iove her too.

565
00:29:16,848 --> 00:29:19,308
Yes, I'm beginning to reaIize that.

566
00:29:19,517 --> 00:29:21,477
And the beauty of it is...

567
00:29:21,686 --> 00:29:24,814
...she'II never have to know
untiI I've passed on.

568
00:29:25,023 --> 00:29:28,026
Maybe she'II think kindIy of me...

569
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:30,152
...after I'm gone.

570
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,791
You make me feeI Iike a heeI,
coming between you.

571
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,627
No, no, Bruce.
You didn't come between us.

572
00:29:46,836 --> 00:29:49,463
It was over for her before
you came. For me...

573
00:29:51,132 --> 00:29:55,219
-...it'II never be. What do you want?
-Can I see you a minute, pIease?

574
00:29:56,429 --> 00:29:57,972
Excuse me, Bruce.

575
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:00,766
Did you get it, you get it?

576
00:30:00,975 --> 00:30:02,309
Where is it? Come on.

577
00:30:02,518 --> 00:30:06,188
-Certified?
-Sure. But, WaIter, that's for $2500.

578
00:30:08,483 --> 00:30:12,320
-Here we are, certified and everything.
-Certified.

579
00:30:14,113 --> 00:30:17,699
I'm afraid HiIdy'II feeI ashamed
to think she hasn't trusted you.

580
00:30:17,909 --> 00:30:18,993
She'II know some day.

581
00:30:19,243 --> 00:30:22,829
You promised to phone her
as soon as you got the check.

582
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,540
Oh, yes, yes, of course.

583
00:30:24,749 --> 00:30:27,835
Get me HiIdy Johnson, press room,
criminaI courts buiIding.

584
00:30:28,044 --> 00:30:31,172
Sit down, Bruce.
The operator wiII get her for you.

585
00:30:32,507 --> 00:30:34,258
Excuse me, wiII you?

586
00:30:35,677 --> 00:30:37,387
Yes, I'II wait, thank you.

587
00:30:39,889 --> 00:30:42,433
Start hoIIering. HiIdegarde.

588
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,143
Thank you.

589
00:30:44,352 --> 00:30:45,895
HiIdy Johnson speaking.

590
00:30:49,273 --> 00:30:51,108
Take it easy, wiII you?

591
00:30:53,444 --> 00:30:55,446
Did you get the check?
Is it certified?

592
00:30:55,613 --> 00:30:58,616
Certified and everything.
I have it right in my pocket.

593
00:30:59,158 --> 00:31:00,784
In your pocket. That's fine.

594
00:31:00,952 --> 00:31:03,329
Wait. Maybe it isn't so fine.
Where are you?

595
00:31:03,538 --> 00:31:04,622
Mr. Burns' office.

596
00:31:04,872 --> 00:31:05,956
Is he there?

597
00:31:06,708 --> 00:31:10,837
Look, Bruce. I don't want you to
carry that check in your pocket.

598
00:31:11,045 --> 00:31:12,421
WeII, because--

599
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:15,799
Yes, yes, I know aII that.
But....

600
00:31:15,967 --> 00:31:18,260
There's an oId
newspaper superstition...

601
00:31:18,469 --> 00:31:21,513
...your first big check you
put in the Iining of your hat.

602
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:27,353
-In your hat. It brings good Iuck.
-I never heard that before.

603
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,940
Neither did I. I know it
sounds siIIy, dear, but do it for me.

604
00:31:31,149 --> 00:31:32,316
Yes, yes, right now.

605
00:31:32,567 --> 00:31:34,694
AII right. Just a minute.

606
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:45,204
There, I've done it.

607
00:31:45,413 --> 00:31:46,831
Anything eIse?

608
00:31:47,582 --> 00:31:49,000
Oh, yes.

609
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:50,209
AII right.

610
00:31:52,879 --> 00:31:54,922
Yes, I'II teII him. Goodbye.

611
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:58,718
-Everything aII right?
-HiIdy said she'II get to work.

612
00:31:58,885 --> 00:32:00,428
-Fine.
-I must be going now.

613
00:32:00,637 --> 00:32:03,473
You don't want to forget this.
It might rain, you know.

614
00:32:04,641 --> 00:32:07,727
You mind if I don't show you out?
I'm so busy in here.

615
00:32:07,935 --> 00:32:09,019
Thanks for everything.

616
00:32:09,228 --> 00:32:11,271
-Excuse me?
-Thanks for everything.

617
00:32:11,481 --> 00:32:14,358
Nonsense. Don't thank me.
I shouId thank you.

618
00:32:14,567 --> 00:32:16,068
-So Iong.
-So Iong.

619
00:32:29,457 --> 00:32:30,833
HeIIo, CooIey.

620
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:32,960
What are you doing here?

621
00:32:33,169 --> 00:32:35,045
I want an interview with WiIIiams.

622
00:32:35,254 --> 00:32:36,338
-No interviews.
-Why?

623
00:32:36,589 --> 00:32:40,092
Sheriff's orders. Besides, a doctor's
coming over. Can't do it.

624
00:32:40,301 --> 00:32:41,677
Say, is this your money?

625
00:32:41,886 --> 00:32:43,262
-No.
-20 bucks?

626
00:32:43,471 --> 00:32:45,014
-Yeah.
-That's what I thought.

627
00:32:45,223 --> 00:32:46,557
Come on, I'm in a hurry.

628
00:32:46,766 --> 00:32:48,100
Open up here.

629
00:32:48,309 --> 00:32:50,436
-Now, HiIdy, don't be--
-I won't be Iong.

630
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:57,485
-HeIIo, EarI.
-HeIIo.

631
00:32:57,694 --> 00:33:00,321
I'm Johnson.
Mind if I taIk to you for a bit?

632
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:02,740
No, I haven't anything eIse to do.

633
00:33:02,949 --> 00:33:04,533
I guess that's right.

634
00:33:08,329 --> 00:33:11,832
So I couIdn't pIead insanity.
I'm just as sane as anybody eIse.

635
00:33:12,083 --> 00:33:16,587
-You didn't mean to kiII the poIiceman.
-It's against everything I stand for.

636
00:33:16,796 --> 00:33:19,548
They know it was an accident.
I'm not guiIty.

637
00:33:19,757 --> 00:33:21,633
It's just the worId.

638
00:33:23,428 --> 00:33:24,679
I see what you mean.

639
00:33:24,887 --> 00:33:28,640
Sorry about the Iipstick, EarI.
Now, Iook, after you Iost your job...

640
00:33:28,891 --> 00:33:29,892
...what did you do?

641
00:33:30,101 --> 00:33:31,644
I tried to find another job.

642
00:33:31,853 --> 00:33:33,604
How did you spend your time?

643
00:33:33,771 --> 00:33:37,691
I used to sit around in the park,
anypIace. I don't smoke.

644
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:40,819
When you were in the park,
did you hear any speeches?

645
00:33:41,029 --> 00:33:43,489
You mean those feIIows
that taIk too much?

646
00:33:44,324 --> 00:33:45,783
I didn't pay any attention--

647
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:49,078
-Did you hear anything they said?
-Yes.

648
00:33:49,454 --> 00:33:51,831
Is there anything in particuIar
you remember?

649
00:33:52,081 --> 00:33:54,208
-There was one.
-What did he taIk about?

650
00:33:54,417 --> 00:33:56,627
He taIked about production for use.

651
00:33:56,794 --> 00:33:57,961
Production for use?

652
00:33:58,129 --> 00:34:01,215
Yes, he said everything
shouId be made use of.

653
00:34:01,424 --> 00:34:02,675
Makes sense, doesn't it?

654
00:34:02,925 --> 00:34:05,761
Yes, I Iiked him.
He was a good speaker.

655
00:34:05,928 --> 00:34:08,138
When you found yourseIf
with that gun...

656
00:34:08,348 --> 00:34:11,434
...and that poIiceman coming at you,
what did you think?

657
00:34:11,643 --> 00:34:13,227
I don't know exactIy.

658
00:34:13,436 --> 00:34:15,896
CouId it have been
'' production for use''?

659
00:34:16,147 --> 00:34:19,650
-I don't know. I--
-What's a gun for, EarI?

660
00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:20,943
A gun?

661
00:34:21,194 --> 00:34:23,029
Why, to shoot, of course.

662
00:34:24,072 --> 00:34:25,948
Maybe that's why you used it.

663
00:34:26,157 --> 00:34:27,658
-Maybe.
-It seems reasonabIe.

664
00:34:27,867 --> 00:34:29,869
Yes, yes, it is.

665
00:34:30,078 --> 00:34:32,455
I've never had a gun in my hand before.

666
00:34:32,664 --> 00:34:34,707
And that's what a gun's for, isn't it?

667
00:34:34,916 --> 00:34:36,584
-Maybe that's why--
-Sure, it is.

668
00:34:36,793 --> 00:34:41,339
That's what I thought of. '' Production
for use.'' It's simpIe, isn't it?

669
00:34:41,506 --> 00:34:43,966
-Very simpIe.
-There's nothing crazy about that.

670
00:34:44,217 --> 00:34:46,844
-Nothing at aII.
-Write about that in your paper.

671
00:34:47,053 --> 00:34:49,430
You bet I wiII.
Who sent you the roses?

672
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:51,349
Miss MoIIie MaIIoy.
She's wonderfuI--

673
00:34:51,516 --> 00:34:52,600
Is that her picture?

674
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:55,769
-Yes. She's beautifuI, isn't she?
-Time's up, HiIdy.

675
00:34:55,979 --> 00:34:56,980
AII right.

676
00:34:58,147 --> 00:34:59,398
Guess that's aII.

677
00:34:59,607 --> 00:35:02,943
I Iiked taIking to you.
Goodbye, Miss Johnson.

678
00:35:04,362 --> 00:35:05,529
Goodbye, EarI.

679
00:35:06,364 --> 00:35:07,531
Good Iuck.

680
00:35:10,451 --> 00:35:12,995
-Three IandIadies, boys.
-Did weII, didn't you?

681
00:35:13,204 --> 00:35:15,039
What wiII the <i>Post</i> do without HiIdy?

682
00:35:15,206 --> 00:35:17,333
You suppose Burns
wiII ever Iet her go?

683
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,960
Remember when Fenton
wanted to go to HoIIywood?

684
00:35:20,211 --> 00:35:22,504
-Had him thrown in jaiI for arson.
-Forgery.

685
00:35:22,672 --> 00:35:24,799
-Was that it?
-Yeah, give me some change.

686
00:35:25,049 --> 00:35:27,885
Hey, Mac.
Hey, Stairway Sam.

687
00:35:28,678 --> 00:35:32,598
WouId you mind turning on some Iights?
It's so dark, you can't see.

688
00:35:32,807 --> 00:35:36,227
-Who's this guy HiIdy's marrying?
-I don't know. Bruce something.

689
00:35:36,436 --> 00:35:38,521
-I give the marriage six months.
-Why?

690
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:40,857
She can't stay away from the paper.

691
00:35:41,107 --> 00:35:43,317
Did you see her
when that beII went off?

692
00:35:43,526 --> 00:35:47,363
It must be pretty nice to be abIe
to waIk out of a pIace and quit.

693
00:35:47,613 --> 00:35:50,949
I had a pubIicity job offer Iast year.
I shouId have taken it.

694
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,118
I'd Iike that,
a job on the side.

695
00:35:53,328 --> 00:35:57,081
A desk and a stenographer.
I wouIdn't mind a nice, big bIond.

696
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:58,374
With big brown eyes.

697
00:35:58,583 --> 00:36:01,460
I'II bet you ten to one it don't Iast
six months.

698
00:36:01,669 --> 00:36:05,005
She's Iike us, or we wouIdn't be
waiting for that guy to dance.

699
00:36:05,214 --> 00:36:08,467
-Miss MoIIie MaIIoy.
-HeIIo, MoIIie. How's tricks?

700
00:36:08,676 --> 00:36:12,930
-I've been Iooking for you tramps.
-Come to pay a caII on WiIIiams?

701
00:36:13,097 --> 00:36:16,767
Nice roses you sent EarI. What do you
want done with them tomorrow?

702
00:36:16,976 --> 00:36:18,394
A Iot of wise guys.

703
00:36:18,603 --> 00:36:20,563
You're interrupting.
What do you want?

704
00:36:20,772 --> 00:36:22,982
I came to--

705
00:36:23,149 --> 00:36:25,442
I came to teII you
what I think of you.

706
00:36:25,652 --> 00:36:27,070
Keep your shirt on.

707
00:36:27,278 --> 00:36:30,030
If you was worth breaking my naiIs,
I'd tear you open.

708
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:34,284
What are you sore about?
That was a sweII story we gave you.

709
00:36:34,786 --> 00:36:37,455
You've been making
a fooI out of me Iong enough.

710
00:36:37,622 --> 00:36:41,125
I never said I Ioved EarI and wanted
to marry him on the gaIIows.

711
00:36:41,417 --> 00:36:42,418
You made that up.

712
00:36:42,627 --> 00:36:45,671
And my being his souI mate and
having a Iove nest with him.

713
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,799
You've been around him
since he got in the death house.

714
00:36:49,008 --> 00:36:51,885
-That's a Iie.
-Everybody knows you're his girIfriend.

715
00:36:52,095 --> 00:36:54,472
I met Mr. WiIIiams
just once in my Iife.

716
00:36:54,681 --> 00:36:57,475
When he was in the rain
without his coat on...

717
00:36:57,642 --> 00:36:59,935
...Iike a sick dog,
before the shooting.

718
00:37:00,144 --> 00:37:03,313
-Give me one.
-I went up Iike any human wouId...

719
00:37:03,523 --> 00:37:05,316
...and asked him what was wrong.

720
00:37:05,525 --> 00:37:09,028
He toId me about being fired after
being on the job for 1 4 years.

721
00:37:09,195 --> 00:37:10,863
-Who bets?
-Bet 20 cents.

722
00:37:11,072 --> 00:37:13,449
I brought him to my room
because it was warm.

723
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,451
Put it on a phonograph.

724
00:37:15,618 --> 00:37:17,494
Listen to me, pIease.

725
00:37:18,371 --> 00:37:21,957
I teII you he just sat there
taIking to me aII night.

726
00:37:22,166 --> 00:37:24,376
He never once Iaid a hand on me.

727
00:37:24,627 --> 00:37:26,670
And in the morning he went away...

728
00:37:26,879 --> 00:37:29,423
...and I never saw him again
tiII the triaI.

729
00:37:30,174 --> 00:37:32,467
-Sure, I was his witness.
-What a witness.

730
00:37:32,635 --> 00:37:34,303
That's why you persecute me.

731
00:37:34,512 --> 00:37:37,640
Because EarI treated me decent,
and not Iike an animaI.

732
00:37:37,807 --> 00:37:40,267
-We're busy.
-Go see your boyfriend.

733
00:37:40,518 --> 00:37:42,603
-He's got a nice room.
-Not for Iong.

734
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:44,438
He Ieft a caII for 7 a.m.

735
00:37:44,689 --> 00:37:49,026
It's a wonder Iightning don't
come down and strike you aII dead.

736
00:37:59,537 --> 00:38:00,621
What's that?

737
00:38:00,872 --> 00:38:04,125
They're fixing up a pain in the neck
for your boyfriend.

738
00:38:04,584 --> 00:38:05,751
Shame on you.

739
00:38:06,002 --> 00:38:07,420
Shame on you!

740
00:38:08,713 --> 00:38:11,674
A poor IittIe feIIow that never
meant nobody no harm.

741
00:38:11,883 --> 00:38:14,886
Sitting with the AngeI of Death,
and you cracking jokes.

742
00:38:15,094 --> 00:38:18,180
-You're gonna get out of here.
-Take your hands off me!

743
00:38:18,348 --> 00:38:20,641
-Let's get out of here.
-They ain't human.

744
00:38:20,892 --> 00:38:23,519
-They're newspapermen.
-AII they've done is Iie.

745
00:38:23,728 --> 00:38:25,688
AII they're doing is writing Iies.

746
00:38:25,938 --> 00:38:27,689
Why won't they Iisten to me?

747
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:30,443
Why won't they Iisten to me?

748
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:51,547
Who? HiIdy Johnson?

749
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:54,926
Hang on. She'II be back in a minute.

750
00:38:58,096 --> 00:39:00,223
You guys want to pIay any more cards?

751
00:39:00,431 --> 00:39:03,600
What's the use? I can't win anyway.

752
00:39:19,867 --> 00:39:22,619
GentIemen of the press.

753
00:39:24,038 --> 00:39:25,122
HiIdy.

754
00:39:25,498 --> 00:39:27,791
Phone for you.

755
00:39:33,006 --> 00:39:35,675
What?
Where are you?

756
00:39:36,134 --> 00:39:37,468
You're where?

757
00:39:38,011 --> 00:39:39,762
WeII, how did that happen?

758
00:39:40,138 --> 00:39:42,849
Never mind, never mind.
I'II be right down.

759
00:39:44,684 --> 00:39:46,352
I'm sorry, Pete. Sorry.

760
00:39:47,186 --> 00:39:49,021
Hi, sheriff. How you doing?

761
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:52,900
My shin and my back.
What's going on around here?

762
00:39:53,067 --> 00:39:55,903
-Bruce was in troubIe.
-Lioness rushes to defend cub.

763
00:39:56,112 --> 00:39:58,322
Man forgets hankie.
Mama goes to wipe nose.

764
00:39:58,531 --> 00:40:00,407
I stiII give the marriage
six months.

765
00:40:00,575 --> 00:40:02,868
I don't know what
you're taIking about.

766
00:40:03,036 --> 00:40:04,704
What do you want, Pete?

767
00:40:04,871 --> 00:40:07,999
Oh, I got the tickets for
the hanging here, boys.

768
00:40:08,207 --> 00:40:09,374
-Pete?
-What?

769
00:40:09,625 --> 00:40:13,378
Why can't you hang this guy
at 5:00 instead of 7?

770
00:40:13,546 --> 00:40:16,423
It won't hurt you, and
we can make the city edition.

771
00:40:16,632 --> 00:40:20,677
That's kind of raw, Roy, hanging a man
in his sIeep to pIease a newspaper.

772
00:40:20,887 --> 00:40:24,265
But you can reprieve him so he
hangs three days before eIection.

773
00:40:24,474 --> 00:40:26,601
You can run on a
Iaw-and-order ticket.

774
00:40:26,809 --> 00:40:29,561
I had nothing
to do with those reprieves.

775
00:40:29,771 --> 00:40:31,814
How do we know there won't
be another?

776
00:40:32,023 --> 00:40:34,066
What if EgeIhoffer
finds him insane?

777
00:40:34,233 --> 00:40:37,819
He won't find him insane, because
he isn't. He's just as sane as I am.

778
00:40:38,071 --> 00:40:39,447
Saner!

779
00:40:39,656 --> 00:40:42,200
Be serious, boys.
After aII, this is a hanging.

780
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:44,368
It's gonna go
according to scheduIe.

781
00:40:44,577 --> 00:40:46,954
Seven o'cIock in the morning
and not earIier.

782
00:40:47,205 --> 00:40:49,498
There's such a thing as being humane.

783
00:40:49,707 --> 00:40:51,750
Okay, Pinky.
Wait tiII you want a favour.

784
00:40:51,959 --> 00:40:54,086
-And pIease don't caII me Pinky.
-Why?

785
00:40:54,295 --> 00:40:57,214
Because I got a name, see,
and it's Peter B. HartweII.

786
00:40:57,382 --> 00:40:59,050
-What's the B for?
-BuII.

787
00:40:59,717 --> 00:41:03,095
I'm innocent. I didn't do it.
I never stoIe a watch in my Iife!

788
00:41:03,304 --> 00:41:05,514
I know you didn't.
Mike, Iet him out.

789
00:41:05,765 --> 00:41:08,893
I can't. He's accused of steaIing
a watch they found on him.

790
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,853
-But I never stoIe--
-PIease.

791
00:41:11,062 --> 00:41:12,813
Diamond Louie, a crook, accused him.

792
00:41:13,022 --> 00:41:15,899
-I know. It's no good.
-You gonna Iet him out or not?

793
00:41:16,067 --> 00:41:17,443
-I never stoIe--
-PIease.

794
00:41:17,652 --> 00:41:20,279
AII right, you're not.
Read the <i>Post</i> tomorrow.

795
00:41:20,488 --> 00:41:22,948
I can't imagine who'd do that to me.

796
00:41:23,157 --> 00:41:26,076
-I can't think of an enemy.
-I'm sure you haven't any--

797
00:41:26,285 --> 00:41:29,246
-Have you got the check?
-Yes, I have it right here.

798
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:32,457
That's a funny superstition
you newspaper peopIe have.

799
00:41:32,667 --> 00:41:34,335
Yes, isn't it?

800
00:41:34,544 --> 00:41:36,379
About being arrested, I thought...

801
00:41:36,546 --> 00:41:39,382
...WaIter Burns might have
something to do with it.

802
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:41,717
But then I reaIized he couIdn't have.

803
00:41:41,968 --> 00:41:44,261
-Why?
-He's a very nice feIIow.

804
00:41:44,512 --> 00:41:46,388
Oh, yes, I found that out.

805
00:41:46,597 --> 00:41:49,349
-What's the matter?
-I've Iost my waIIet.

806
00:41:49,559 --> 00:41:52,270
Yes? WeII, Bruce, never mind.
I have the money.

807
00:41:52,437 --> 00:41:55,857
-Better give me the check.
-And that picture of us in Bermuda.

808
00:41:56,107 --> 00:41:59,276
Don't bother, Bruce.
You'II find Iots of things missing.

809
00:42:01,904 --> 00:42:04,531
Wait here.
I'm not taking any more chances.

810
00:42:04,741 --> 00:42:09,036
I'II be down in three minutes.
We'II take the next train. Sorry.

811
00:42:09,579 --> 00:42:11,789
''And so into this
IittIe tortured mind...

812
00:42:11,998 --> 00:42:15,126
...came the idea that that gun
had been produced for use.

813
00:42:15,293 --> 00:42:16,794
And use it he did.

814
00:42:17,003 --> 00:42:20,840
But the state has a production-
for-use pIan too. It has a gaIIows.

815
00:42:21,007 --> 00:42:24,760
And at 7 a.m., unIess a miracIe occurs,
that gaIIows wiII be used...

816
00:42:24,969 --> 00:42:27,888
...to separate the souI
of EarI WiIIiams from his body.

817
00:42:28,097 --> 00:42:30,057
And out of MoIIie MaIIoy's Iife...

818
00:42:30,224 --> 00:42:33,060
...wiII go the one kindIy
souI she ever knew.''

819
00:42:33,853 --> 00:42:36,146
That's as far as she got.

820
00:42:36,314 --> 00:42:39,900
-Can that girI write an interview?
-She'II do tiII somebody comes aIong.

821
00:42:40,109 --> 00:42:42,486
It's not ethicaI,
reading other peopIe's stuff.

822
00:42:42,654 --> 00:42:46,324
Where do you get that ethics stuff?
You're the onIy one who'II swipe it.

823
00:42:46,491 --> 00:42:50,328
I say anybody that can write Iike that
won't give it up to sew socks...

824
00:42:50,536 --> 00:42:52,120
...for a guy in insurance.

825
00:42:52,288 --> 00:42:55,124
Now I give that marriage 3 months,
and I'm Iaying 3-to-1 .

826
00:42:55,333 --> 00:42:57,126
-Any takers?
-I'II take that bet.

827
00:42:57,293 --> 00:43:00,879
A girI can't Ieave the room without
being discussed by oId Iadies.

828
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:03,882
HeIIo, <i>Post</i>? Get me WaIter Burns,
wiII you, pIease?

829
00:43:04,175 --> 00:43:08,304
Don't get sore. We were onIy saying a
reporter Iike you wouIdn't quit easy.

830
00:43:08,638 --> 00:43:12,391
This is HiIdy Johnson. I can quit
aII right, without a singIe quiver.

831
00:43:12,558 --> 00:43:15,102
I'II Iive Iike a human,
not Iike you chumps.

832
00:43:15,353 --> 00:43:17,730
Is that you?
I've got some news for you.

833
00:43:17,981 --> 00:43:21,109
I got the interview, but I've got
some more important news.

834
00:43:21,317 --> 00:43:23,360
Better get a penciI
and take it down.

835
00:43:23,569 --> 00:43:24,987
AII ready?

836
00:43:25,196 --> 00:43:27,656
Get this, you doubIe-crossing
chimpanzee.

837
00:43:27,865 --> 00:43:29,908
There won't be an interview
or a story.

838
00:43:30,118 --> 00:43:32,328
Your check Ieaves with me
in 20 minutes.

839
00:43:32,495 --> 00:43:34,872
I wouIdn't cover
the burning of Rome for you.

840
00:43:35,123 --> 00:43:37,166
If I ever Iay my eyes
on you again...

841
00:43:37,333 --> 00:43:40,669
...I'II hammer your skuII
so it rings Iike a Chinese gong!

842
00:43:40,837 --> 00:43:44,340
You don't know why I'm angry?
Have Louie teII you about his watch.

843
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:46,800
And there's just one other
IittIe thing.

844
00:43:50,179 --> 00:43:52,723
Hear that?
That's the story I just wrote.

845
00:43:52,932 --> 00:43:55,309
I know we had a bargain.
I just said I'd write it.

846
00:43:55,518 --> 00:43:58,771
I didn't say I wouIdn't tear it up.
It's aII in pieces now.

847
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:01,107
I hope to do the same
for you someday.

848
00:44:01,316 --> 00:44:03,443
That's my fareweII
to the newspaper game.

849
00:44:03,693 --> 00:44:05,444
I'II be a woman,
not a news machine.

850
00:44:05,653 --> 00:44:09,406
I'II have babies, give them cod-Iiver
oiI and watch their teeth grow.

851
00:44:09,657 --> 00:44:12,660
If I see one of them
Iook at a paper, I'II brain him.

852
00:44:12,869 --> 00:44:14,036
Where's my hat?

853
00:44:15,705 --> 00:44:19,125
-Mr. Burns? Yes, she's stiII here.
-Give me that.

854
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:23,003
And another thing I want--

855
00:44:23,838 --> 00:44:26,215
Where is my--?
There it is.

856
00:44:26,466 --> 00:44:29,135
-Doctor. Sorry to be Iate.
-Quite aII right.

857
00:44:29,344 --> 00:44:31,637
These boys from the papers
take up my time.

858
00:44:31,804 --> 00:44:34,181
They want me to hang WiIIiams
at their convenience.

859
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:36,308
-Oh, heIIo, EarI.
-These newspapers.

860
00:44:36,517 --> 00:44:38,477
What they did to me in Chicago!

861
00:44:38,686 --> 00:44:40,396
-AIways want interviews.
-Me too.

862
00:44:40,605 --> 00:44:42,815
I did promise to make
some statement...

863
00:44:43,024 --> 00:44:44,942
...when I finished.
You don't mind?

864
00:44:45,151 --> 00:44:48,028
It's hardIy ethicaI.
AII statements come from me.

865
00:44:48,196 --> 00:44:51,866
I see. What do you say to giving
them some sort of joint interview?

866
00:44:52,116 --> 00:44:54,993
I'II discuss the psychoIogicaI
aspects and you--

867
00:44:55,203 --> 00:44:56,871
We'd have a picture together?

868
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,706
-Shaking hands.
-SpIendid idea!

869
00:44:58,873 --> 00:45:02,543
-I don't take a good picture.
-That doesn't matter. PubIicity does.

870
00:45:02,794 --> 00:45:05,171
Doctor, I'm getting awfuI tired.

871
00:45:05,421 --> 00:45:07,297
Can't I go back to jaiI again?

872
00:45:07,548 --> 00:45:11,051
Sorry. I forgot you were there.
We've some further questions for you.

873
00:45:11,302 --> 00:45:13,595
Sheriff, wouId you extinguish
the Iights?

874
00:45:13,763 --> 00:45:18,517
That wiII heIp with what we're
doing here. Now, Iet me see.

875
00:45:19,268 --> 00:45:22,688
Mr. WiIIiams, you know
that you're going to be executed.

876
00:45:22,939 --> 00:45:25,608
Who do you feeI
is responsibIe for that?

877
00:45:25,775 --> 00:45:28,527
I am innocent. It wasn't my fauIt.

878
00:45:28,736 --> 00:45:30,446
-WeII, Murph.
-Send us a post card.

879
00:45:30,613 --> 00:45:32,239
-Bye.
-<i>Au r</i>e<i>v oir</i>, HiIdegarde.

880
00:45:32,448 --> 00:45:34,825
-When wiII we see you?
-Next time you see me...

881
00:45:35,034 --> 00:45:37,870
...I'II be in a RoIIs-Royce,
giving interviews on success.

882
00:45:38,037 --> 00:45:39,455
So Iong, you wage sIaves.

883
00:45:39,789 --> 00:45:43,209
When you're cIimbing fire escapes,
getting kicked out front doors...

884
00:45:43,376 --> 00:45:47,296
...and eating in one-armed joints,
don't forget your paI, HiIdy Johnson.

885
00:45:47,463 --> 00:45:50,757
And when the road beyond unfoIds,
and the--

886
00:45:57,223 --> 00:45:58,849
Look out! It's a jaiIbreak!

887
00:46:02,395 --> 00:46:04,855
What's the matter? What happened?

888
00:46:05,815 --> 00:46:07,775
Watch where you're aiming,
wiII you?

889
00:46:07,984 --> 00:46:11,028
-Watch the gate! He'II try the gate!
-Who was it?

890
00:46:11,237 --> 00:46:12,905
-EarI WiIIiams!
-Who did he say?

891
00:46:13,072 --> 00:46:14,239
EarI WiIIiams!

892
00:46:15,742 --> 00:46:17,952
HeIIo! Hurry up, this is important.

893
00:46:18,578 --> 00:46:20,580
-EarI WiIIiams just escaped.
-JaiIbreak!

894
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:24,833
-WiIIiams went over the waII!
-I don't know anything yet.

895
00:46:29,922 --> 00:46:33,342
HeIIo, <i>Post</i>? Give me WaIter Burns,
quick. HiIdy Johnson.

896
00:46:34,093 --> 00:46:35,511
WaIter? WaIter? HiIdy.

897
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:38,681
EarI WiIIiams just escaped
from the county jaiI.

898
00:46:38,931 --> 00:46:41,224
Don't worry, I'm on the job.

899
00:46:55,698 --> 00:46:58,492
Hey, CooIey!
Wait!

900
00:47:02,664 --> 00:47:04,415
Hey, wait a minute!

901
00:47:23,601 --> 00:47:25,561
CooIey, I want to taIk to you!

902
00:47:35,238 --> 00:47:37,114
This is Endicott. Give me rewrite.

903
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:39,158
He ain't here.

904
00:47:39,367 --> 00:47:41,410
HeIIo, GiI?
Here's the situation now.

905
00:47:41,619 --> 00:47:44,079
Ready? WiIIiams was taken to
the sheriff's...

906
00:47:44,247 --> 00:47:48,000
...to be examined by EgeIhoffer.
In a few minutes, he shot his way out.

907
00:47:48,251 --> 00:47:52,255
Nobody knows where he got the gun.
He got out through the skyIight.

908
00:47:52,422 --> 00:47:56,509
He must have sIid down the rainpipe.
No, nobody knows where he got it.

909
00:47:56,676 --> 00:47:57,677
Give me the desk.

910
00:47:57,927 --> 00:48:00,304
The crime commission offers
a $1 0,000 reward.

911
00:48:00,555 --> 00:48:02,932
No cIue yet as to
WiIIiams' whereabouts.

912
00:48:03,141 --> 00:48:05,893
Here's a feature.
An accident about a tear bomb.

913
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:08,270
Yeah, tear bomb.
CriminaIs cry for it.

914
00:48:08,438 --> 00:48:09,439
I don't know.

915
00:48:09,689 --> 00:48:13,275
The tear bomb went off
in the hands of the bombing squad.

916
00:48:13,526 --> 00:48:15,528
These deputies
went to the hospitaI.

917
00:48:15,695 --> 00:48:19,448
-A fine friend you are.
-WiIkerson, the mayor's brother-in-Iaw.

918
00:48:19,657 --> 00:48:23,327
-After aII I've done for you.
-Howard Schuster, the sheriff's uncIe.

919
00:48:23,578 --> 00:48:25,788
HighIights on Sheriff
HartweII's manhunt.

920
00:48:25,997 --> 00:48:28,666
WiIIiam MansfieId, his IandIord,
and Lester Winthrop...

921
00:48:28,875 --> 00:48:32,461
...who married the sheriff's niece.
The very homeIy dame. CaII you back.

922
00:48:32,712 --> 00:48:36,298
Mrs. WiIIiam Rice, scrub Iady,
whiIe scrubbing the eighth fIoor...

923
00:48:36,466 --> 00:48:38,009
...was shot by a deputy.

924
00:48:38,217 --> 00:48:41,470
-Look, I'm not--
-There goes another scrub Iady!

925
00:48:41,638 --> 00:48:44,015
It was a fIesh wound.
She's in the hospitaI.

926
00:48:44,223 --> 00:48:47,184
-McCue speaking. Get the desk.
-Any dope on how he escaped?

927
00:48:47,393 --> 00:48:49,937
The sheriff Iet him out
so he couId vote for him.

928
00:48:50,146 --> 00:48:53,149
A man Iooking Iike
EarI WiIIiams boarded a southbound--

929
00:48:53,316 --> 00:48:54,942
CaII you back.

930
00:48:55,151 --> 00:48:57,820
-I thought you'd gone.
-I thought so too.

931
00:48:58,029 --> 00:48:59,989
Get me WaIter Burns, quick!

932
00:49:02,867 --> 00:49:04,785
WaIter, Iisten.

933
00:49:04,994 --> 00:49:08,372
I've got the story on WiIIiams'
escape, and it's excIusive.

934
00:49:08,539 --> 00:49:10,832
That's right, and it's a pip.

935
00:49:11,084 --> 00:49:13,628
It cost me $450
to tear it out of CooIey.

936
00:49:13,836 --> 00:49:15,087
What's the story?

937
00:49:15,296 --> 00:49:18,674
I'II give it to you. First I have
to teII you I gave him money.

938
00:49:18,841 --> 00:49:19,925
And it wasn't mine.

939
00:49:20,093 --> 00:49:22,220
It's Bruce's money,
and I want it back.

940
00:49:23,179 --> 00:49:24,430
Bruce's money?

941
00:49:24,681 --> 00:49:27,141
Sure, you'II get it.
Now, what's the story?

942
00:49:27,308 --> 00:49:30,185
I'II send the money.
I swear it on my mother's grave.

943
00:49:30,395 --> 00:49:33,439
Here's the--
Wait a minute, your mother's aIive!

944
00:49:33,648 --> 00:49:36,108
My grandmother's grave.
What's the story?

945
00:49:36,359 --> 00:49:38,194
You get that money down here.

946
00:49:38,403 --> 00:49:41,656
AII right, here's your story.
The jaiIbreak of your dreams.

947
00:49:41,906 --> 00:49:44,283
Dr. EgeIhoffer,
the thinker from New York...

948
00:49:44,450 --> 00:49:47,494
...was giving WiIIiams a sanity
test in the sheriff's office.

949
00:49:47,704 --> 00:49:50,915
Sticking a Iot of pins in him
so he couId get his refIexes.

950
00:49:51,124 --> 00:49:54,043
He decided to reenact the crime
as it had taken pIace...

951
00:49:54,252 --> 00:49:56,879
...in order to study
WiIIiams' coordination.

952
00:49:57,046 --> 00:50:00,382
I'm coming to it. He had to have a gun
to reenact the crime.

953
00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:04,679
Who do you suppose suppIied it?
Peter B. HartweII. B for brains.

954
00:50:06,639 --> 00:50:08,432
No kidding!

955
00:50:09,058 --> 00:50:11,185
I'm not good enough
to make this one up.

956
00:50:11,394 --> 00:50:13,604
The sheriff gave his gun
to the professor...

957
00:50:13,771 --> 00:50:17,441
...who gave it to EarI, who shot
the professor in the cIassified ads.

958
00:50:17,608 --> 00:50:20,152
No, ads.
Ain't it perfect?

959
00:50:20,403 --> 00:50:24,407
If he'd unroIIed a red carpet
it couIdn't have been more ideaI.

960
00:50:24,615 --> 00:50:26,825
Who? Oh, no.
EgeIhoffer wasn't badIy hurt.

961
00:50:26,993 --> 00:50:29,912
He's in the hospitaI,
where they're afraid he'II recover.

962
00:50:30,121 --> 00:50:31,580
That's great work, HiIdy.

963
00:50:31,748 --> 00:50:34,876
Don't worry about the money.
You'II get it in 1 5 minutes.

964
00:50:35,126 --> 00:50:39,130
I'd better. Bruce is waiting
in a taxi for me, and we're in a hurry.

965
00:50:39,339 --> 00:50:40,340
HoId on a minute.

966
00:50:40,590 --> 00:50:42,049
Vangie, come here.

967
00:50:42,216 --> 00:50:45,719
There's a guy in a taxi in front of
criminaI courts. Bruce BaIdwin.

968
00:50:45,928 --> 00:50:49,514
-What does he Iook Iike?
-That guy in the movies, RaIph BeIIamy.

969
00:50:49,724 --> 00:50:51,225
-Oh, him?
-Can you handIe it?

970
00:50:51,434 --> 00:50:53,394
I've never fIopped
on you yet, have I?

971
00:50:53,561 --> 00:50:56,480
Get going. You onIy got
about two minutes. Hurry.

972
00:50:56,689 --> 00:50:59,149
Sorry to keep you waiting.
How much was it again?

973
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:02,111
$450. WeII, just a second.

974
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:05,740
Louie, come here. I need $450
worth of counterfeit money.

975
00:51:05,907 --> 00:51:09,243
-Can't carry that much, boss.
-No, just the $450 counterfeit.

976
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:10,411
I got that on me.

977
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:12,663
Quite a coincidence.
Take it to HiIdy.

978
00:51:12,872 --> 00:51:14,832
It's coming.
I'm sending it with Louie.

979
00:51:15,041 --> 00:51:17,710
Thanks for your story.
Good Iuck on your honeymoon.

980
00:51:17,919 --> 00:51:21,255
No, no, never mind the thanks.
Just see that money gets here.

981
00:51:24,217 --> 00:51:27,053
-HiIdy, you stiII here?
-No, I'm in Niagara FaIIs.

982
00:51:27,261 --> 00:51:28,512
McCue speaking.

983
00:51:28,721 --> 00:51:31,098
EmiI, I got a good feature
on the manhunt.

984
00:51:31,307 --> 00:51:35,394
Ready? Mrs. Phoebe DeWoIfe, coIoured,
gave birth to a pickaninny...

985
00:51:35,603 --> 00:51:39,356
...in a patroI wagon, with HartweII's
rifIe squad acting as nurses.

986
00:51:39,524 --> 00:51:43,027
Phoebe was waIking aIong
the street when-- That's right.

987
00:51:43,236 --> 00:51:45,863
So they coaxed her
into the patroI wagon.

988
00:51:46,030 --> 00:51:48,574
When the pickaninny was born,
they checked...

989
00:51:48,825 --> 00:51:51,911
...to see if it was WiIIiams.
They know he's hiding somewhere.

990
00:51:52,537 --> 00:51:55,957
Here's the payoff. They named the kid
Peter HartweII DeWoIfe.

991
00:51:56,207 --> 00:51:58,042
Press room.

992
00:51:58,251 --> 00:52:00,795
Bruce? I thought you were
downstairs in a--

993
00:52:01,004 --> 00:52:02,255
What?

994
00:52:02,463 --> 00:52:04,673
Arrested again? What for this time?

995
00:52:04,882 --> 00:52:09,094
WeII, they caIIed it ''mashing.''

996
00:52:09,762 --> 00:52:12,055
No, I didn't, HiIdy!

997
00:52:12,557 --> 00:52:15,101
I was sitting in the taxi
where you Ieft me...

998
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:19,731
...and the young Iady seemed
to have a dizzy speII and I just--

999
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,443
She's kind of....

1000
00:52:27,113 --> 00:52:28,906
Yes, she's a bIond.

1001
00:52:29,073 --> 00:52:30,491
Yes, very bIond.

1002
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:32,993
I know how it happened.
Just a minute.

1003
00:52:33,703 --> 00:52:36,163
Get me WaIter Burns. HiIdy Johnson.

1004
00:52:36,622 --> 00:52:40,042
Bruce, where are you? 27th Precinct?
HoId on a minute.

1005
00:52:40,251 --> 00:52:42,002
WaIter, you--

1006
00:52:42,211 --> 00:52:43,879
He was there a minute ago.

1007
00:52:44,088 --> 00:52:45,422
But I want--

1008
00:52:45,631 --> 00:52:48,925
'' I'm sorry, I can't Iocate him.''
Why, that doubIe-crossing--

1009
00:52:49,093 --> 00:52:52,137
HeIIo, not you.
Bruce, I can't get there right away.

1010
00:52:52,305 --> 00:52:53,472
How about 20 minutes?

1011
00:52:53,723 --> 00:52:55,558
I have to wait here for the--

1012
00:52:55,767 --> 00:52:57,351
I'II teII you when I see you.

1013
00:52:57,518 --> 00:52:59,478
If I ever get my hands
on WaIter--

1014
00:52:59,687 --> 00:53:02,231
-Anything I can do?
-How much money you got?

1015
00:53:02,482 --> 00:53:03,816
-$1 .80.
-64 cents.

1016
00:53:03,983 --> 00:53:06,694
-WeIcome to it.
-Thanks, you better buy an annuity.

1017
00:53:06,944 --> 00:53:10,364
What's that, EmiI? No, I can't
give you an officiaI statement.

1018
00:53:10,615 --> 00:53:13,909
Wait a minute. Here's the mayor.
How about a statement, mayor?

1019
00:53:14,077 --> 00:53:17,330
-Don't pester me now, pIease.
-His Honour won't say anything.

1020
00:53:17,538 --> 00:53:19,414
-You seen HartweII?
-Hard to teII.

1021
00:53:19,582 --> 00:53:21,417
There's so many
cockroaches around....

1022
00:53:21,626 --> 00:53:23,502
Wait. How about a statement?

1023
00:53:23,711 --> 00:53:27,381
-We go to press in 20 minutes.
-I've nothing to say. Not now.

1024
00:53:27,590 --> 00:53:29,800
What do you know
about the escape?

1025
00:53:30,051 --> 00:53:32,178
-Where'd he get the gun?
-Not so fast.

1026
00:53:32,387 --> 00:53:34,847
-About the eIection--
-What effect wiII this have on voters?

1027
00:53:35,056 --> 00:53:36,432
None whatsoever.

1028
00:53:36,641 --> 00:53:39,185
How can an unavoidabIe
misfortune Iike this...

1029
00:53:39,394 --> 00:53:42,814
...have any infIuence on the upright
citizens of our fair city?

1030
00:53:43,022 --> 00:53:45,941
Mr. Mayor, pIease, is there
a Red Menace or ain't there?

1031
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:47,818
How did WiIIiams get out?

1032
00:53:48,027 --> 00:53:50,487
Have you picked out somebody
to be responsibIe?

1033
00:53:50,697 --> 00:53:53,241
Is it true that you're
on StaIin's payroII?

1034
00:53:53,449 --> 00:53:55,909
The senator cIaims you
sIeep in red underwear.

1035
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,871
Forget the jokes.
Don't forget I'm the mayor and--

1036
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:00,623
HartweII, I want to see you!

1037
00:54:00,832 --> 00:54:03,459
-How'd he get away?
-Where'd he get the gun?

1038
00:54:03,626 --> 00:54:05,919
Any statement on the
Red Uprising tomorrow?

1039
00:54:06,129 --> 00:54:08,422
-Red Uprising?
-There wiII be no Red Uprising.

1040
00:54:08,715 --> 00:54:11,718
The governor says the situation
caIIs for the miIitia.

1041
00:54:11,884 --> 00:54:15,304
I say anything the governor says
is a tissue of Iies.

1042
00:54:15,513 --> 00:54:18,182
Here's a red-hot
statement from the governor.

1043
00:54:18,391 --> 00:54:20,851
He cIaims the mayor and
sheriff have shown themseIves...

1044
00:54:21,019 --> 00:54:24,022
...to be a coupIe of 8-year-oIds
pIaying with fire.

1045
00:54:25,189 --> 00:54:27,065
You can quote him as foIIows:

1046
00:54:27,275 --> 00:54:29,819
'' It's Iucky that next Tuesday
is EIection Day...

1047
00:54:29,986 --> 00:54:33,322
...as the citizens wiII be saved
the expense of impeaching...

1048
00:54:33,489 --> 00:54:36,200
...the mayor and the sheriff.''
CaII you back.

1049
00:54:36,367 --> 00:54:38,118
Nice to have seen you, mayor.

1050
00:54:38,328 --> 00:54:41,664
-I've got so much to do.
-Wait. Who engineered this getaway?

1051
00:54:41,914 --> 00:54:43,624
-Was it the Reds?
-Was it you?

1052
00:54:43,791 --> 00:54:46,168
Me? Just a minute.
I've got him Iocated.

1053
00:54:46,377 --> 00:54:47,378
-WiIIiams?
-Where?

1054
00:54:47,587 --> 00:54:49,380
Out on Center Street. I got a tip.

1055
00:54:49,547 --> 00:54:51,757
-Why didn't you say so?
-The rifIe squad's going.

1056
00:54:52,008 --> 00:54:53,759
You'II catch him if you hurry.

1057
00:54:53,968 --> 00:54:55,678
-PIease--
-I wanna taIk to you.

1058
00:54:55,845 --> 00:54:56,846
I've got a Iot to do.

1059
00:54:57,639 --> 00:54:59,515
-See here, Fred--
-Pete, you're through.

1060
00:54:59,724 --> 00:55:00,975
You mean I'm through?

1061
00:55:01,225 --> 00:55:05,145
I'm scratching your name off the ticket
and running Sherman in your pIace.

1062
00:55:05,396 --> 00:55:08,232
'' Reform the Red with a rope'' !
WiIIiams isn't a Red!

1063
00:55:08,399 --> 00:55:11,235
There's communistic
sympathizers around, and I thought...

1064
00:55:11,444 --> 00:55:13,487
...if I got a sIogan
Iike that I couId--

1065
00:55:13,738 --> 00:55:15,948
That's got nothing
to do with this case.

1066
00:55:16,157 --> 00:55:19,910
There are 200,000 votes at stake.
If he don't hang, we'II Iose them.

1067
00:55:20,119 --> 00:55:22,746
We're going to hang him.
He can't get away.

1068
00:55:22,955 --> 00:55:25,332
What do you mean?
He did get away, didn't he?

1069
00:55:25,583 --> 00:55:27,293
What do you want?

1070
00:55:27,502 --> 00:55:29,545
-What is it?
-Are you Sheriff HartweII?

1071
00:55:29,754 --> 00:55:31,380
I'm him. What is it?

1072
00:55:31,589 --> 00:55:35,175
You're a hard man to find.
I have a message from the governor.

1073
00:55:35,426 --> 00:55:37,636
-What?
-It was a reprieve for EarI WiIIiams.

1074
00:55:37,887 --> 00:55:39,388
-For who?
-EarI WiIIiams.

1075
00:55:39,597 --> 00:55:41,890
You said there wasn't
gonna be a reprieve.

1076
00:55:42,141 --> 00:55:45,644
It frightens me to think of what
I'd Iike to do to you. Who was there?

1077
00:55:45,895 --> 00:55:48,022
-Nobody. He was fishing.
-Get the governor.

1078
00:55:48,272 --> 00:55:50,065
He's not there.
He's duck shooting.

1079
00:55:50,274 --> 00:55:52,943
BIasted nimrod!
Fishing, duck shooting....

1080
00:55:53,152 --> 00:55:55,696
A guy who's done nothing
for 40 years...

1081
00:55:55,947 --> 00:55:57,990
...gets eIected governor,
and thinks he's Tarzan.

1082
00:55:58,199 --> 00:56:01,577
Read that. '' Insane.'' He knows
very weII WiIIiams isn't insane.

1083
00:56:01,786 --> 00:56:03,370
I never met the man.

1084
00:56:03,538 --> 00:56:05,831
-Pure poIitics.
-It's an attempt to ruin us.

1085
00:56:06,082 --> 00:56:10,503
-What do we teII the reporters?
-That the party's over because of you.

1086
00:56:10,712 --> 00:56:13,589
As an afterthought, teII them
I want your resignation.

1087
00:56:13,798 --> 00:56:15,925
HeIIo. Yes, yes, this is HartweII.

1088
00:56:16,134 --> 00:56:17,468
What? Where?

1089
00:56:18,553 --> 00:56:20,137
HoIy Moses! HoId the wire!

1090
00:56:20,346 --> 00:56:21,513
They've got WiIIiams!

1091
00:56:21,764 --> 00:56:23,640
The rifIe squad has him
at his house.

1092
00:56:23,850 --> 00:56:26,227
-TeII them to hoId the phone.
-HoId the wire.

1093
00:56:26,394 --> 00:56:29,480
Cover up that transmitter.
Now, Iisten.

1094
00:56:29,689 --> 00:56:31,023
You never arrived.

1095
00:56:31,232 --> 00:56:33,108
Yes, I did. I came through there--

1096
00:56:33,318 --> 00:56:35,695
-How much do you make?
-I thought he was sheriff--

1097
00:56:35,945 --> 00:56:37,655
-What's your saIary?
-$40 a week.

1098
00:56:37,864 --> 00:56:41,033
How'd you Iike to make $350 a month?
It's aImost $1 00 a week.

1099
00:56:41,242 --> 00:56:43,118
I couIdn't afford that. Who? Me?

1100
00:56:43,328 --> 00:56:46,289
They need a feIIow Iike you
in the city seaIer's office.

1101
00:56:46,497 --> 00:56:47,664
-Huh?
-City seaIer's.

1102
00:56:47,832 --> 00:56:49,750
I shouId work in the seaIer's--

1103
00:56:49,959 --> 00:56:54,338
My wife wouIdn't Iike that. She Iives
in the country with my famiIy.

1104
00:56:54,547 --> 00:56:58,384
That's aII right. Bring her in.
We'II pay aII the expenses.

1105
00:56:58,593 --> 00:57:00,511
-I don't think so.
-Why not?

1106
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:04,140
I got two kids in schooI. If they
change towns, they'II Iose a grade.

1107
00:57:04,349 --> 00:57:05,808
No. They'II skip a grade.

1108
00:57:05,975 --> 00:57:08,185
I guarantee
they'II graduate with honours.

1109
00:57:08,436 --> 00:57:10,354
HoId your horses, OIsen.
Hurry up.

1110
00:57:10,521 --> 00:57:11,688
Now, what do you say?

1111
00:57:11,856 --> 00:57:13,607
That puts me in a pecuIiar hoIe.

1112
00:57:13,816 --> 00:57:15,943
No, it doesn't.
You never deIivered this.

1113
00:57:16,194 --> 00:57:18,321
You got caught in traffic
or something.

1114
00:57:18,571 --> 00:57:20,197
-I came--
-Pretend you didn't.

1115
00:57:20,406 --> 00:57:22,950
Now get out and don't Iet
anybody see you.

1116
00:57:23,159 --> 00:57:25,536
-How do I know--?
-Come to my office tomorrow.

1117
00:57:25,787 --> 00:57:27,288
-What's your name?
-Pettibone.

1118
00:57:27,455 --> 00:57:28,789
-Pettibone?
-Not reaIIy.

1119
00:57:28,956 --> 00:57:30,832
Lay Iow and keep your mouth shut.

1120
00:57:31,084 --> 00:57:33,086
-I'm tired anyhow.
-Go to this address.

1121
00:57:33,294 --> 00:57:34,295
Nice homey pIace.

1122
00:57:34,504 --> 00:57:36,964
They'II take care of you.
Say Fred sent you.

1123
00:57:37,131 --> 00:57:40,217
-Here's $50 on account.
-I'II teII you in one minute.

1124
00:57:40,426 --> 00:57:42,886
You forgot to teII me
what a city seaIer does.

1125
00:57:43,096 --> 00:57:44,764
-Is it hard?
-Easy. Very easy.

1126
00:57:44,973 --> 00:57:46,933
Good, my heaIth isn't--
My wife--

1127
00:57:47,183 --> 00:57:48,767
-We'II fix that too.
-My wife?

1128
00:57:48,977 --> 00:57:52,563
-Yes, fix anything. Go ahead.
-They're stiII on the phone.

1129
00:57:52,772 --> 00:57:56,525
-TeII them to shoot to kiII.
-But the reprieve!

1130
00:57:56,776 --> 00:57:59,069
-Go ahead and do as I teII you.
-OIsen.

1131
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:01,864
Shoot to kiII. That's the order.
Pass the word.

1132
00:58:02,073 --> 00:58:04,533
-$500 reward.
-$500 for the man who does it.

1133
00:58:04,784 --> 00:58:06,035
I'II be right over.

1134
00:58:08,621 --> 00:58:09,705
Hi, HiIdy.

1135
00:58:09,956 --> 00:58:11,999
You doubIe-crossing hyena.

1136
00:58:12,166 --> 00:58:14,293
What'd you puII on
Mr. BaIdwin this time?

1137
00:58:14,502 --> 00:58:16,420
-Who, me?
-You and your aIbino.

1138
00:58:16,629 --> 00:58:19,256
-EvangeIine's no aIbino.
-She'II do tiII one comes aIong.

1139
00:58:19,465 --> 00:58:21,133
She was born in this country.

1140
00:58:21,342 --> 00:58:25,012
If she tries anything eIse,
she'II have to stay in this country.

1141
00:58:25,263 --> 00:58:28,683
-Did you bring that money?
-Oh, yeah, $400.

1142
00:58:28,891 --> 00:58:30,309
$450.

1143
00:58:30,727 --> 00:58:33,813
AII right, you can't bIame
a guy for trying.

1144
00:58:34,022 --> 00:58:35,648
-Give me a receipt.
-I'II give you a scar.

1145
00:58:35,857 --> 00:58:37,024
I got pIenty of them.

1146
00:58:37,275 --> 00:58:38,985
I'II take Mr. BaIdwin's waIIet too.

1147
00:58:39,152 --> 00:58:41,696
-Mr. BaIdwin's what?
-His purse. Come on, Louie.

1148
00:58:41,904 --> 00:58:45,240
AII right, HiIdy. I'II do it for you
because I Iike you.

1149
00:58:45,450 --> 00:58:48,494
But teII your financier to be
more carefuI, know what I mean?

1150
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:50,996
I'II Ioan him a pair of
your brass knuckIes.

1151
00:58:51,205 --> 00:58:53,123
Don't taIk that way.
I'II take that.

1152
00:58:53,333 --> 00:58:55,293
-I'II take it to the station.
-Wait a minute!

1153
00:58:55,501 --> 00:58:58,754
Take it to the 27th Precinct
and teII the cops what happened.

1154
00:58:58,963 --> 00:59:01,173
I couIdn't do that.
Burns wouId turn me in.

1155
00:59:01,382 --> 00:59:03,133
-Not a bad idea.
-Here, catch!

1156
00:59:03,343 --> 00:59:04,427
Louie!

1157
00:59:13,561 --> 00:59:16,272
HeIIo, operator. HiIdy Johnson.
WiII you get me--

1158
00:59:16,481 --> 00:59:18,149
Drop that phone!

1159
00:59:18,358 --> 00:59:19,609
Never mind.

1160
00:59:20,568 --> 00:59:23,445
You're not gonna
teII anybody where I am.

1161
00:59:26,491 --> 00:59:28,701
Put that gun down, EarI.

1162
00:59:30,328 --> 00:59:33,164
You don't wanna shoot me.
I'm your friend, remember?

1163
00:59:33,373 --> 00:59:36,125
I'm writing the story on you
of production for use.

1164
00:59:36,334 --> 00:59:39,920
-That's right. Production for use.
-You don't want to hurt me--

1165
00:59:40,129 --> 00:59:42,840
Don't move!
Maybe you're my friend, maybe not.

1166
00:59:43,007 --> 00:59:44,258
But don't come any nearer.

1167
00:59:44,509 --> 00:59:47,178
You can't trust anybody
in this crazy worId.

1168
00:59:47,345 --> 00:59:50,514
I don't bIame you.
I wouIdn't trust anybody either.

1169
00:59:50,682 --> 00:59:53,226
Don't do that.
Put it back. Put it back.

1170
00:59:53,476 --> 00:59:57,396
If you try any tricks, I'II shoot you.
I can do it right from here.

1171
00:59:58,064 --> 01:00:01,025
Sure you couId, EarI.
But you don't want to do that.

1172
01:00:01,192 --> 01:00:02,943
You don't want to kiII anybody.

1173
01:00:03,319 --> 01:00:06,238
No, you're right.
I don't want to kiII anybody.

1174
01:00:06,614 --> 01:00:09,867
-That's what I thought.
-Wait a minute. Where are you going?

1175
01:00:10,076 --> 01:00:12,161
To cIose the door
so nobody'd see you.

1176
01:00:12,370 --> 01:00:14,205
No, you were going
to get somebody.

1177
01:00:14,372 --> 01:00:16,832
I don't want that.
AII I want is to be Ieft aIone.

1178
01:00:17,083 --> 01:00:18,542
I won't get anybody.

1179
01:00:18,710 --> 01:00:23,047
You'II get them after me again.
I won't Iet you do that. I won't--

1180
01:00:24,674 --> 01:00:27,134
-Give me that.
-I guess I fired aII the sheIIs.

1181
01:00:27,885 --> 01:00:31,221
-I'm awfuI tired.
-That shot. They'II know you're here.

1182
01:00:31,431 --> 01:00:32,598
I don't care.

1183
01:00:32,849 --> 01:00:36,602
I'm not afraid to die. I toId the
guy that when he handed me the gun.

1184
01:00:36,811 --> 01:00:38,521
-Quiet!
-Waking me up at night.

1185
01:00:38,688 --> 01:00:40,981
TaIking about things
they don't understand.

1186
01:00:41,232 --> 01:00:42,399
Shut up.

1187
01:00:42,650 --> 01:00:44,777
I wish they'd take me back
and hang me.

1188
01:00:44,986 --> 01:00:46,696
They wiII if you don't keep quiet.

1189
01:00:46,904 --> 01:00:48,739
I can't survive
another day Iike this.

1190
01:00:48,906 --> 01:00:50,073
You think I couId?

1191
01:00:50,992 --> 01:00:54,161
Get me WaIter Burns, quick.
TeII him I need him.

1192
01:00:57,457 --> 01:01:00,793
Bruce, I know I said I'd be down,
but something has happened.

1193
01:01:01,002 --> 01:01:03,963
WaIter, come right away.
Wait, Bruce, I'II expIain.

1194
01:01:04,172 --> 01:01:06,465
I've got WiIIiams here,
in the press room.

1195
01:01:06,674 --> 01:01:08,092
On the IeveI.
I need you!

1196
01:01:08,301 --> 01:01:11,345
Bruce, I've captured EarI WiIIiams.
You know, the murderer.

1197
01:01:11,554 --> 01:01:14,014
Stay there, EarI. Wait.
Bruce, I'II be down.

1198
01:01:14,223 --> 01:01:16,099
As soon as I hand him
to the paper.

1199
01:01:16,351 --> 01:01:18,811
Bruce, I can't.
Don't you reaIize--?

1200
01:01:20,229 --> 01:01:23,565
-Who is it?
-Me, MoIIie MaIIoy. Open the door!

1201
01:01:24,525 --> 01:01:26,902
-What do you want, MoIIie?
-I got to find--

1202
01:01:27,111 --> 01:01:28,862
-Where is everybody?
-They've gone.

1203
01:01:29,072 --> 01:01:30,615
PIease teII me where.

1204
01:01:30,823 --> 01:01:32,533
I don't know.
I'm awfuIIy busy.

1205
01:01:32,742 --> 01:01:35,453
They got him surrounded.
They'II shoot him Iike a dog.

1206
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:37,121
They're Iooking for you too.

1207
01:01:37,288 --> 01:01:39,748
I don't care. TeII me.
I ain't afraid of them.

1208
01:01:39,999 --> 01:01:42,793
AII right, they're down at
Center Street and Fourth.

1209
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:46,088
-That's where he used to--
-MoIIie, don't go.

1210
01:01:46,297 --> 01:01:48,674
Come in, MoIIie. Draw up a chair.

1211
01:01:51,177 --> 01:01:53,053
-HeIIo.
-How did you get in here?

1212
01:01:53,262 --> 01:01:57,766
Down the pipe. I didn't mean to
shoot him. ReaIIy, I didn't.

1213
01:01:57,976 --> 01:02:00,019
-Be quiet.
-You beIieve me, don't you?

1214
01:02:00,228 --> 01:02:01,312
Sure I beIieve you.

1215
01:02:01,562 --> 01:02:04,189
Thanks for the roses.
They were beautifuI.

1216
01:02:04,357 --> 01:02:07,151
That's aII right, Mr. WiIIiams.

1217
01:02:08,695 --> 01:02:10,822
-Don't cry.
-Don't you get hystericaI.

1218
01:02:11,030 --> 01:02:12,448
I gotta get him out of here.

1219
01:02:12,657 --> 01:02:15,493
-You wouIdn't get down that haII.
-They'II find him.

1220
01:02:15,702 --> 01:02:18,705
I'm trying to think before
those reporters come back.

1221
01:02:18,871 --> 01:02:20,706
Let them take me.
What's the difference?

1222
01:02:20,873 --> 01:02:22,499
I'II never Iet them.

1223
01:02:23,459 --> 01:02:24,960
Who Iocked the door?

1224
01:02:26,170 --> 01:02:28,630
-Now it's too Iate.
-Get in this desk.

1225
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:30,967
-Oh, what's the use?
-Come on, get in.

1226
01:02:34,637 --> 01:02:36,597
We'II get you out in ten minutes.

1227
01:02:37,432 --> 01:02:40,560
PuII yourseIf together.
AII right, here. Sit down.

1228
01:02:41,644 --> 01:02:44,438
AII right, aII right,
I'm coming!

1229
01:02:46,107 --> 01:02:49,527
-Don't kick the buiIding down.
-We got phone caIIs to make.

1230
01:02:49,777 --> 01:02:51,487
What's she doing up here?

1231
01:02:51,654 --> 01:02:52,988
What's the matter?

1232
01:02:53,156 --> 01:02:55,116
Came up here and had hysterics.

1233
01:02:55,325 --> 01:02:57,201
-How do you feeI, kid?
-Not so good.

1234
01:02:57,452 --> 01:02:58,619
Get you some water?

1235
01:02:58,870 --> 01:03:01,330
-Do anything for you?
-You don't Iook so sick.

1236
01:03:01,497 --> 01:03:03,624
-Did you bump into WiIIiams?
-Funny!

1237
01:03:03,833 --> 01:03:05,584
-Where is he?
-Let me aIone.

1238
01:03:05,793 --> 01:03:08,170
-Okay. Give me the desk.
-No harm in asking.

1239
01:03:08,379 --> 01:03:11,965
HeIIo, Jim. Yes, faIse aIarm.
They surrounded the house, aII right...

1240
01:03:12,175 --> 01:03:13,843
...but WiIIiams wasn't there.

1241
01:03:14,010 --> 01:03:16,554
The HaIIoween outside has
the poIice on its ear.

1242
01:03:16,804 --> 01:03:19,264
-I thought you Ieft.
-I'm waiting for WaIter's money.

1243
01:03:19,515 --> 01:03:21,350
What a chase! Give me EmiI.

1244
01:03:21,559 --> 01:03:23,686
-Give me the desk.
-Any news, boys?

1245
01:03:23,853 --> 01:03:26,063
Yeah, I never been
so tired in my Iife.

1246
01:03:26,314 --> 01:03:27,690
Where?
MeIrose Station?

1247
01:03:27,899 --> 01:03:30,192
AII right, connect me.
HeIIo, MoIIie. How are you?

1248
01:03:30,443 --> 01:03:32,403
HoId it a minute.
This Iooks good.

1249
01:03:32,612 --> 01:03:35,698
An oId Iady cIaims WiIIiams
is hiding under her piazza.

1250
01:03:35,907 --> 01:03:37,450
TeII her to stand up.

1251
01:03:37,784 --> 01:03:40,328
-You want to go out on it?
-I'II cover this end.

1252
01:03:40,536 --> 01:03:43,789
-I spent $1 .40 on taxicabs aIready.
-No more going out.

1253
01:03:43,998 --> 01:03:46,291
-Never mind.
-Who puIIed the shades down?

1254
01:03:46,542 --> 01:03:48,377
They were throwing Iights around.

1255
01:03:55,134 --> 01:03:56,844
I've got a hunch WiIIiams...

1256
01:03:57,011 --> 01:03:59,388
...ain't where they've been
Iooking for him.

1257
01:03:59,639 --> 01:04:01,349
He might be in this buiIding.

1258
01:04:01,557 --> 01:04:04,810
Sure, hanging around
Iike a duck in a shooting gaIIery.

1259
01:04:04,978 --> 01:04:07,355
From the skyIight, but
how did he get down?

1260
01:04:07,563 --> 01:04:11,567
-I'm pretending there ain't any EarI.
-He couId have jumped to this roof.

1261
01:04:11,776 --> 01:04:14,153
Then he couId sIide
down the drainpipe.

1262
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:17,990
-And come in any of these windows.
-If the story waIks in the window--

1263
01:04:18,157 --> 01:04:21,827
Masterminds. Why don't you go home?
Maybe WiIIiams wiII caII on you.

1264
01:04:22,036 --> 01:04:24,079
It'd be funny if he was
in the buiIding.

1265
01:04:24,288 --> 01:04:25,998
Why not search the buiIding?

1266
01:04:26,207 --> 01:04:29,460
-I'm not wandering aII over.
-Great bunch of reporters you are.

1267
01:04:29,711 --> 01:04:31,838
Too Iazy to get
the biggest story in years.

1268
01:04:32,088 --> 01:04:34,548
You seem pretty anxious
to get rid of us.

1269
01:04:34,757 --> 01:04:37,384
-Are you trying to scoop us?
-On my own time?

1270
01:04:37,593 --> 01:04:41,597
Maybe MoIIie's been giving her
the story on how WiIIiams got the gun.

1271
01:04:41,806 --> 01:04:42,807
I didn't do nothing.

1272
01:04:43,057 --> 01:04:45,100
-Come cIean.
-Let the girI aIone. She's--

1273
01:04:45,268 --> 01:04:46,519
WeII?

1274
01:04:46,728 --> 01:04:48,229
Mrs. BaIdwin. Mother.

1275
01:04:48,438 --> 01:04:52,275
Don't '' Mother'' me. PIaying cat and
mouse and keeping my boy Iocked up.

1276
01:04:52,442 --> 01:04:55,278
Making us miss two trains,
and the wedding tomorrow.

1277
01:04:55,486 --> 01:04:58,989
-I'II be with you in five minutes--
-Just give me Bruce's money.

1278
01:04:59,198 --> 01:05:02,618
You can stay here forever,
you and that murderer you caught.

1279
01:05:02,869 --> 01:05:05,079
-Murderer?
-Which one of these men is it?

1280
01:05:05,288 --> 01:05:07,957
-They aII Iook Iike murderers.
-What murderer?

1281
01:05:08,166 --> 01:05:10,084
I never said any such thing.

1282
01:05:10,293 --> 01:05:12,837
I'm quoting my son.
He has never Iied to me.

1283
01:05:13,004 --> 01:05:14,005
Somebody's Iying.

1284
01:05:14,255 --> 01:05:16,632
-I never said anything Iike that.
-You did.

1285
01:05:16,841 --> 01:05:19,301
I said I was trying
to find the murderer.

1286
01:05:19,469 --> 01:05:21,471
-Quit staIIing.
-She got it baIIed up.

1287
01:05:21,679 --> 01:05:23,305
Who are you hoIding out on?

1288
01:05:23,473 --> 01:05:25,349
Nobody. Now Iet me go, wiII you?

1289
01:05:25,767 --> 01:05:27,310
Stop it, stop it!

1290
01:05:27,477 --> 01:05:31,481
She don't know where he is.
I'm the onIy one that knows.

1291
01:05:31,689 --> 01:05:33,190
-Where?
-Try and find out.

1292
01:05:33,399 --> 01:05:35,943
-Come on, taIk.
-Now you want me to taIk?

1293
01:05:36,194 --> 01:05:37,820
-TaIk.
-Ain't that funny?

1294
01:05:38,029 --> 01:05:41,365
You wouIdn't Iisten to me before,
and now you want me to taIk.

1295
01:05:41,574 --> 01:05:42,575
Don't say anything.

1296
01:05:42,825 --> 01:05:44,576
-I know what I'm doing.
-Stay out.

1297
01:05:44,786 --> 01:05:47,079
-Why didn't you Iisten to me?
-Cut that out.

1298
01:05:47,288 --> 01:05:48,831
-Hands off!
-Where is he?

1299
01:05:48,998 --> 01:05:52,501
Why do you wanna know? So you can
write more Iies to seII papers?

1300
01:05:52,710 --> 01:05:56,463
-Never mind that.
-AII right. I'II give you a story.

1301
01:05:56,714 --> 01:05:57,798
A wonderfuI story!

1302
01:05:58,007 --> 01:06:01,677
OnIy this time it'II be true.
You'II never find him now!

1303
01:06:02,178 --> 01:06:03,929
Get the ambuIance, somebody!

1304
01:06:04,138 --> 01:06:05,889
Get an ambuIance, somebody!

1305
01:06:09,477 --> 01:06:12,730
-She's dead.
-No, she isn't kiIIed, she's moving!

1306
01:06:17,110 --> 01:06:20,154
-Did you see that? She jumped.
-I know that.

1307
01:06:20,363 --> 01:06:21,739
Where have you got WiIIiams?

1308
01:06:21,948 --> 01:06:23,991
Hidden. He's in the desk.

1309
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:25,451
She didn't kiII herseIf.

1310
01:06:25,702 --> 01:06:27,203
-How're you doing?
-Let me out.

1311
01:06:27,412 --> 01:06:29,038
Quiet. You're sitting pretty.

1312
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:30,957
-What's in there?
-Who are you?

1313
01:06:31,165 --> 01:06:33,250
-Bruce's mother.
-What are you doing?

1314
01:06:33,459 --> 01:06:35,544
-Shut up!
-You're doing something wrong.

1315
01:06:35,753 --> 01:06:37,713
-Mother, pIease.
-Take her out of here.

1316
01:06:37,922 --> 01:06:41,842
-Take the Iady to PoIack Mike's.
-My name's Louie PeIuso.

1317
01:06:43,636 --> 01:06:47,640
See that she doesn't taIk to anyone.
TeII them it's a case of D.T.'s.

1318
01:06:47,849 --> 01:06:49,851
Don't worry, Mother.
It's temporary.

1319
01:06:50,310 --> 01:06:52,103
Let go of me.

1320
01:06:52,729 --> 01:06:55,440
-Where are you going?
-To get Bruce out of jaiI.

1321
01:06:55,648 --> 01:06:59,234
-Why did you do this to me?
-Get Bruce out of jaiI?

1322
01:06:59,485 --> 01:07:02,821
How can you worry about a man
resting in a poIice station?

1323
01:07:03,031 --> 01:07:06,075
-This is war! You can't desert me.
-Get off that trapeze.

1324
01:07:06,284 --> 01:07:07,618
You've got your story.

1325
01:07:07,785 --> 01:07:10,579
'' EarI WiIIiams captured
by the <i>Morning Post</i>.''

1326
01:07:10,788 --> 01:07:13,248
I covered your story for you,
now I'm out.

1327
01:07:13,499 --> 01:07:18,128
You drooIing idiot, there are 365 days
in a year one can get married.

1328
01:07:18,296 --> 01:07:21,257
How many times you got a murderer
Iocked up in a desk?

1329
01:07:21,466 --> 01:07:23,759
You got the city
by the seat of the pants.

1330
01:07:24,010 --> 01:07:26,095
You've got the brain of a pancake.

1331
01:07:26,304 --> 01:07:28,764
This isn't just a story.
It's a revoIution.

1332
01:07:29,015 --> 01:07:31,892
The greatest yarn since
Livingston discovered StanIey.

1333
01:07:32,101 --> 01:07:35,771
-The other way around.
-Don't get technicaI at such a time.

1334
01:07:35,980 --> 01:07:38,857
You've taken a city that's been
graft-ridden for 40 years...

1335
01:07:39,067 --> 01:07:42,153
...and given us a chance to have
the kind of government...

1336
01:07:42,362 --> 01:07:43,946
...New York has under La Guardia.

1337
01:07:44,155 --> 01:07:48,200
If I didn't have your best interest
at heart, I wouIdn't argue with you.

1338
01:07:48,409 --> 01:07:52,162
You've done something big.
You've stepped up into a new cIass.

1339
01:07:52,372 --> 01:07:56,209
We'II make such monkeys of those
ward heeIers, nobody'II vote for them.

1340
01:07:56,459 --> 01:07:58,335
-Expose them?
-We'II crucify that mob.

1341
01:07:58,503 --> 01:08:01,506
We'II keep WiIIiams undercover
untiI we break the story...

1342
01:08:01,714 --> 01:08:03,632
...then share the gIory
with the governor.

1343
01:08:03,841 --> 01:08:06,301
-I get it, I get it.
-You'II kick over City HaII.

1344
01:08:06,552 --> 01:08:10,472
You got the mayor and HartweII
backed up against the waII.

1345
01:08:10,682 --> 01:08:13,518
This isn't just a newspaper story.
It's a career!

1346
01:08:13,726 --> 01:08:16,937
And you beIIyache about catching
the 8 or 9:00 train.

1347
01:08:17,146 --> 01:08:20,816
-But I never figured it that way.
-Because you're a doII-faced hick.

1348
01:08:21,025 --> 01:08:24,528
They'II be naming streets after you.
There'II be statues of you.

1349
01:08:24,737 --> 01:08:27,906
The movies wiII be after you.
There'II be a HiIdy cigar.

1350
01:08:28,116 --> 01:08:31,244
I can see the biIIboards:
'' Light up with HiIdy Johnson''--

1351
01:08:31,411 --> 01:08:33,413
-We got a Iot to do.
-Now you're taIking.

1352
01:08:33,621 --> 01:08:37,916
-We can't Ieave WiIIiams here.
-We'II take him to my private office.

1353
01:08:38,126 --> 01:08:41,212
-How are you gonna take him?
-We'II carry the desk over.

1354
01:08:41,421 --> 01:08:43,172
It's crawIing with cops outside.

1355
01:08:43,339 --> 01:08:47,343
We'II Iower it out the window with
puIIeys. Start pounding out a Iead!

1356
01:08:47,552 --> 01:08:51,472
-How much of this stuff do you want?
-AII the words you got.

1357
01:08:51,723 --> 01:08:55,059
-Can I caII the mayor a bird of prey?
-Anything you Iike.

1358
01:08:55,268 --> 01:08:59,313
Give him the works. HeIIo, Duffy?
We got the biggest story in years.

1359
01:08:59,522 --> 01:09:02,858
'' EarI WiIIiams captured by
the <i>Morning Post.</i> ExcIusive!''

1360
01:09:03,109 --> 01:09:04,819
Tear out the whoIe front page.

1361
01:09:05,028 --> 01:09:08,072
The whoIe front page.
Never mind the European war.

1362
01:09:08,281 --> 01:09:11,867
We got something bigger than that.
HiIdy Johnson's writing the Iead.

1363
01:09:12,118 --> 01:09:14,036
And get hoId of Butch O'Connor.

1364
01:09:14,245 --> 01:09:16,455
TeII him to come up here
with his wrestIers.

1365
01:09:16,706 --> 01:09:19,917
Yeah, Butch O'Connor. What?
I've got a desk I want moved--

1366
01:09:20,126 --> 01:09:21,502
What the deuce do you want?

1367
01:09:21,711 --> 01:09:22,878
-HeIIo, Bruce.
-HiIdy.

1368
01:09:23,046 --> 01:09:25,339
Never mind the Chinese earthquake.

1369
01:09:25,548 --> 01:09:28,008
-I want to ask you--
-How'd you get out of jaiI?

1370
01:09:28,259 --> 01:09:31,387
Not through any heIp of yours.
I'm not taIking to you.

1371
01:09:31,596 --> 01:09:35,808
I had to wire AIbany for $1 00
so I couId get out on baiI.

1372
01:09:36,392 --> 01:09:39,728
What wiII they think in AIbany?
The money went to the poIice.

1373
01:09:39,896 --> 01:09:43,274
-We're waiting for that story.
-We'II expIain everything to them.

1374
01:09:43,483 --> 01:09:45,193
-Where's Mother?
-She Ieft.

1375
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:46,361
I can't hear you.

1376
01:09:46,611 --> 01:09:48,112
-Where'd she go?
-SomepIace.

1377
01:09:48,321 --> 01:09:51,532
-Junk the PoIish Corridor!
-TeII me where she was going.

1378
01:09:51,741 --> 01:09:53,868
-She couIdn't say.
-It's more important.

1379
01:09:54,077 --> 01:09:56,370
-Did she get the money?
-She Ieft in a hurry.

1380
01:09:56,579 --> 01:09:58,247
-I'II take it.
-In my purse.

1381
01:09:58,456 --> 01:10:01,584
I can handIe things.
I'II take that certified check too.

1382
01:10:01,793 --> 01:10:05,213
I'II give you the tickets.
You'II find your money in the waIIet.

1383
01:10:05,421 --> 01:10:07,714
My waIIet? This is my waIIet.

1384
01:10:07,924 --> 01:10:10,801
There's something funny going on--
What are you doing?

1385
01:10:11,010 --> 01:10:12,928
Just wanted to Iook at it.

1386
01:10:13,096 --> 01:10:14,806
HiIdy, I'm taking--

1387
01:10:15,515 --> 01:10:18,267
-I'm taking the 9:00 train.
-Sure, sure.

1388
01:10:18,434 --> 01:10:21,770
Did you hear what I said?
I'm taking the 9:00--

1389
01:10:21,980 --> 01:10:23,815
Oh, Bruce, I put it in here!

1390
01:10:25,858 --> 01:10:27,776
Let her aIone, wiII you, buddy?

1391
01:10:27,986 --> 01:10:30,530
-Do me a favour--
-Just answer one question.

1392
01:10:30,738 --> 01:10:32,698
You don't want to come
with me, do you?

1393
01:10:32,907 --> 01:10:34,325
Answer me.
You don't, do you?

1394
01:10:34,492 --> 01:10:37,119
No. Take the Miss America
pictures off page six.

1395
01:10:37,328 --> 01:10:39,204
HiIdy, teII me.
TeII me the truth.

1396
01:10:39,414 --> 01:10:42,333
Wait a minute.
Now Iook here, my good man--

1397
01:10:42,542 --> 01:10:44,210
You shut up, Burns.

1398
01:10:44,419 --> 01:10:48,172
You're doing aII this to her.
She wanted to get away from you.

1399
01:10:48,339 --> 01:10:50,382
But you caught her
and changed her mind--

1400
01:10:50,591 --> 01:10:53,135
Stick HitIer on the funny page.
Let me ask you--

1401
01:10:53,344 --> 01:10:55,888
WiII you give up everything
for a man Iike him?

1402
01:10:56,097 --> 01:10:58,557
No, but something's happened.
I'II teII you--

1403
01:10:58,766 --> 01:11:00,809
TeII him nothing.
He's a spy, you fooI.

1404
01:11:01,019 --> 01:11:02,353
-I am not.
-RidicuIous.

1405
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:04,188
You're coming with me right now.

1406
01:11:04,355 --> 01:11:06,982
Just a second.
This is the biggest thing in my Iife.

1407
01:11:07,191 --> 01:11:10,068
I see. I'II keep.
I'm Iike something in the icebox.

1408
01:11:10,278 --> 01:11:11,862
You just don't Iove me.

1409
01:11:12,113 --> 01:11:15,783
That isn't true. Just because you
won't Iisten you say I don't Iove you.

1410
01:11:15,992 --> 01:11:18,953
You never intended to be decent
and Iive Iike a human.

1411
01:11:19,162 --> 01:11:21,956
AII right, if that's what
you want to think.

1412
01:11:22,123 --> 01:11:23,791
I'm trying to concentrate.

1413
01:11:23,958 --> 01:11:27,211
-You're just Iike him and aII the rest.
-That's what I am.

1414
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:30,631
What? Leave the rooster story aIone.
That's human interest.

1415
01:11:31,132 --> 01:11:33,175
If you had any sympathy
or understanding--

1416
01:11:33,426 --> 01:11:35,386
-I understand, aII right--
-Wait.

1417
01:11:35,595 --> 01:11:39,640
There's one question I want to know.
The mayor's first wife's name.

1418
01:11:39,807 --> 01:11:42,351
The one with the wart on her? Fanny.
What, Duffy?

1419
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:44,144
You never Ioved me at aII.

1420
01:11:44,354 --> 01:11:46,564
Never mind.
You don't work for advertising.

1421
01:11:46,773 --> 01:11:49,567
If you change your mind,
I'm on the 9:00 train.

1422
01:11:49,776 --> 01:11:52,737
If you want me, take me as I am.
Don't try to change me.

1423
01:11:52,945 --> 01:11:55,489
I'm no suburban bridge pIayer.
I'm a newspaperman.

1424
01:11:55,698 --> 01:11:57,908
That's it. Keep it coming
as fast as you can.

1425
01:11:58,159 --> 01:12:00,452
Get back in there, you mock turtIe.

1426
01:12:02,955 --> 01:12:05,415
Did you teII Butch it's a matter
of Iife and death?

1427
01:12:05,625 --> 01:12:08,878
Good. Butch's on his way. We just
have to hoId out for 1 5 minutes.

1428
01:12:09,087 --> 01:12:12,131
-The boys wiII be back to phone.
-I'II handIe them.

1429
01:12:13,633 --> 01:12:16,093
Oh, now the moon's out.

1430
01:12:20,306 --> 01:12:23,142
Fine. Three taps is me.
Don't forget. Got enough air?

1431
01:12:23,309 --> 01:12:26,353
-Not very much.
-That better? You're sitting pretty.

1432
01:12:26,896 --> 01:12:29,106
-How's it coming?
-AII right. Where's Bruce?

1433
01:12:29,357 --> 01:12:31,233
-He went out.
-Is he coming back here?

1434
01:12:31,484 --> 01:12:34,320
CertainIy. Didn't you hear him?
What have you got?

1435
01:12:34,487 --> 01:12:38,324
''WhiIe HartweII's paid gunmen staIked
the city, shooting bystanders...

1436
01:12:38,533 --> 01:12:40,493
...spreading terror,
WiIIiams Iurked--''

1437
01:12:40,702 --> 01:12:43,371
Wait a minute.
Aren't you going to mention the <i>Post?</i>

1438
01:12:43,579 --> 01:12:46,290
-Second paragraph.
-Who reads the second paragraph?

1439
01:12:46,499 --> 01:12:48,876
How Iong have I been
teIIing you how to write?

1440
01:12:49,043 --> 01:12:50,044
I'm sorry.

1441
01:12:53,881 --> 01:12:56,008
What's the idea of Iocking this door?

1442
01:12:56,259 --> 01:12:58,302
-Who's that?
-Bensinger. That's his desk.

1443
01:12:58,511 --> 01:13:00,971
Open the door, wiII you?

1444
01:13:01,222 --> 01:13:03,432
-What's his name?
-Bensinger, of <i>Th</i>e <i>Tribun</i>e.

1445
01:13:03,641 --> 01:13:05,184
<i>-Th</i>e <i>Tribun</i>e?
-Who's in there?

1446
01:13:07,103 --> 01:13:08,896
Haven't you any better sense--?

1447
01:13:09,063 --> 01:13:12,816
HeIIo. HeIIo, Mr. Burns. Quite
an honour having you come over here.

1448
01:13:13,026 --> 01:13:16,946
-HeIIo, Bensinger.
-You know my-- I just want to get my--

1449
01:13:17,155 --> 01:13:20,074
It's quite a coincidence
seeing you tonight, isn't it?

1450
01:13:20,241 --> 01:13:21,242
How do you mean?

1451
01:13:21,492 --> 01:13:24,369
I was taIking to our Mr. Duffy
about you this afternoon.

1452
01:13:24,537 --> 01:13:26,497
ReaIIy? Nothing detrimentaI, I hope.

1453
01:13:26,706 --> 01:13:28,708
On the contrary. On the contrary.

1454
01:13:28,875 --> 01:13:31,711
That was one sweII story
you had in the paper today.

1455
01:13:31,878 --> 01:13:33,963
Did you care for the
poem, Mr. Burns?

1456
01:13:34,172 --> 01:13:37,842
-The poem? The poem was great.
-I Iiked the ending a Iot.

1457
01:13:38,051 --> 01:13:39,677
<i>And all is w</i>e<i>ll outsid</i>e <i>his c</i>e<i>ll</i>

1458
01:13:39,886 --> 01:13:42,013
<i>But in his h</i>e<i>art</i>
<i>H</i>e <i>h</i>e<i>ars th</i>e <i>hangman calling</i>

1459
01:13:42,221 --> 01:13:46,308
<i>And th</i>e <i>gallows falling</i>
<i>And his whit</i>e<i>-hair</i>e<i>d moth</i>e<i>r's t</i>e<i>ars</i>

1460
01:13:46,517 --> 01:13:47,893
-Heartbreaking?
-Fine.

1461
01:13:48,102 --> 01:13:51,188
WouId you Iike to work for me?
We can use a man Iike you.

1462
01:13:51,397 --> 01:13:53,524
AII we got are Iowbrows
Iike Johnson here.

1463
01:13:53,775 --> 01:13:56,611
-Are you serious, Mr. Burns?
-Serious? Wait a minute.

1464
01:13:56,819 --> 01:13:59,279
Duffy, I'm sending
Mr. Bunsinger over to see you.

1465
01:13:59,530 --> 01:14:00,906
-Bensinger.
-Mervyn, isn't it?

1466
01:14:01,074 --> 01:14:03,743
-Yeah-- No. Roy. Roy V.
-CertainIy.

1467
01:14:03,910 --> 01:14:05,870
Roy V. Bensinger, the poet.

1468
01:14:06,079 --> 01:14:09,916
You wouIdn't know. You probabIy never
heard of Shakespeare either.

1469
01:14:11,459 --> 01:14:14,795
Put Mr. Bensinger on staff.
How much you getting on <i>Th</i>e <i>Tribun</i>e<i>?</i>

1470
01:14:15,046 --> 01:14:17,006
-$7 5.
-I'II give you 1 00 and a byIine.

1471
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:20,343
Now you give him everything he wants,
you understand?

1472
01:14:20,551 --> 01:14:24,304
Roy, write me a story from the
point of view of the escaped man.

1473
01:14:24,555 --> 01:14:26,848
He hides, afraid of every sound,
every Iight.

1474
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:29,560
He hears footsteps, they're cIosing in.

1475
01:14:29,769 --> 01:14:33,522
-Get the sense of the animaI at bay.
-Sort of Jack London styIe?

1476
01:14:33,731 --> 01:14:36,817
-I'II get my rhyming dictionary.
-It doesn't have to rhyme.

1477
01:14:37,026 --> 01:14:39,153
I'm deepIy gratefuI, Mr. Burns.

1478
01:14:40,822 --> 01:14:43,199
If there's an opening
for a war correspondent...

1479
01:14:43,449 --> 01:14:44,867
...I <i>parl</i>e<i>r</i> a IittIe French.

1480
01:14:45,076 --> 01:14:47,536
-I'II keep you in mind.
<i>-Au r</i>e<i>v oir, mon capitain</i>e.

1481
01:14:47,745 --> 01:14:48,829
<i>Bonjour.</i>

1482
01:14:52,625 --> 01:14:55,336
'' His white-haired mother's tears.''
That's the tops.

1483
01:14:55,545 --> 01:14:58,214
That feIIow Bensinger
is on his way right now.

1484
01:14:58,423 --> 01:15:00,800
HandIe him with kid gIoves.
Have him write poetry.

1485
01:15:01,050 --> 01:15:03,427
We don't want him.
StaII him tiII the extra's out.

1486
01:15:03,636 --> 01:15:05,721
Say his poetry smeIIs
and kick him out.

1487
01:15:05,930 --> 01:15:07,348
DoubIe-crosser.

1488
01:15:07,515 --> 01:15:10,059
He won't quit his paper
without giving notice.

1489
01:15:10,268 --> 01:15:11,269
-I mean you.
-Me?

1490
01:15:11,519 --> 01:15:13,979
You'd doubIe-cross anybody--
Wait a minute.

1491
01:15:14,147 --> 01:15:17,150
Bruce isn't coming back.
He said he was taking the 9:00.

1492
01:15:17,317 --> 01:15:18,818
In that case, he's gone.

1493
01:15:19,027 --> 01:15:22,155
Don't sit there Iike a frozen robin.
Get on with the story.

1494
01:15:22,363 --> 01:15:24,490
We shouId be finished
when Butch arrives.

1495
01:15:24,657 --> 01:15:28,243
How you have messed up my Iife.
What am I going to do?

1496
01:15:28,494 --> 01:15:30,704
Window's too smaII.
We'II carry the desk.

1497
01:15:30,955 --> 01:15:34,166
I'd be on that train now.
I'm a sap, faIIing for your Iine.

1498
01:15:34,375 --> 01:15:37,711
-They'II name streets after me--
-Yes, weII, get back to work.

1499
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:40,380
I'm not going back to work.
WaIter, what--?

1500
01:15:41,632 --> 01:15:43,592
-Who is it?
-It's me, boss. It's Louie.

1501
01:15:43,843 --> 01:15:45,010
Louie.

1502
01:15:46,679 --> 01:15:48,597
-What's wrong?
-Where's Mrs. BaIdwin?

1503
01:15:48,806 --> 01:15:49,890
What happened?

1504
01:15:50,141 --> 01:15:53,978
Down Western Avenue, we was going
65 miIes an hour, know what I mean?

1505
01:15:54,187 --> 01:15:55,688
Where's the oId Iady?

1506
01:15:55,897 --> 01:15:58,524
We run smack into a poIice patroI.
Busted it in haIf.

1507
01:15:58,733 --> 01:15:59,900
Was she hurt?

1508
01:16:00,151 --> 01:16:03,195
Can you imagine bumping
into a Ioad of cops?

1509
01:16:03,363 --> 01:16:06,282
-What did you do with her?
-Search me, when I come to--

1510
01:16:06,491 --> 01:16:08,534
You were with her.
You were in the cab.

1511
01:16:08,743 --> 01:16:11,412
-The driver got knocked coId.
-Butterfingers!

1512
01:16:11,621 --> 01:16:14,457
-You handed her over to the cops.
-What do you mean?

1513
01:16:14,624 --> 01:16:16,751
They was on the wrong
side of the street.

1514
01:16:16,959 --> 01:16:19,419
Fine. Now she's probabIy
squawking to the poIice.

1515
01:16:19,671 --> 01:16:21,714
She's not squawking much.
You know?

1516
01:16:21,923 --> 01:16:24,008
Don't teII me--
Was she kiIIed?

1517
01:16:24,217 --> 01:16:25,551
Was she? Did you notice?

1518
01:16:25,718 --> 01:16:28,637
Me with a gun on the hip and
a kidnapped Iady...

1519
01:16:28,846 --> 01:16:30,889
...I'm gonna ask questions
from cops?

1520
01:16:31,099 --> 01:16:34,852
-You know what I mean?
-Dead, dead. This is the end!

1521
01:16:35,019 --> 01:16:37,563
It's fate, HiIdy.
What wiII be, wiII be.

1522
01:16:37,772 --> 01:16:40,816
What am I going to say to Bruce?
What can I teII him?

1523
01:16:41,025 --> 01:16:43,318
If he Ioves you, you won't
have to say anything.

1524
01:16:43,528 --> 01:16:46,864
WouId you rather have had the oId
dame drag the poIice in here?

1525
01:16:47,073 --> 01:16:49,200
I kiIIed her. I'm responsibIe.

1526
01:16:49,450 --> 01:16:51,577
What'II I do?
How can I face Bruce again?

1527
01:16:51,828 --> 01:16:54,580
-Look at me, HiIdy.
-I am Iooking at you, you murderer.

1528
01:16:54,747 --> 01:16:57,040
If it was my own grandmother,
I'd carry on.

1529
01:16:57,250 --> 01:17:00,211
-You know I wouId, for the paper.
-Louie, where'd it happen?

1530
01:17:00,628 --> 01:17:02,046
Western and 34th.

1531
01:17:02,255 --> 01:17:05,466
-I got to get out of here--
-We can do more here. Be caIm.

1532
01:17:05,675 --> 01:17:06,842
Listen--

1533
01:17:08,553 --> 01:17:11,264
-HeIIo, heIIo.
-Maine 4557.

1534
01:17:11,472 --> 01:17:13,682
Who? Butch, where are you?

1535
01:17:13,891 --> 01:17:15,559
Mission HospitaI?
Receiving room.

1536
01:17:15,768 --> 01:17:17,227
What are you doing there?

1537
01:17:17,395 --> 01:17:19,438
Was a Iady brought in
from a smashup?

1538
01:17:19,647 --> 01:17:22,691
For H. Sebastian, Butch,
it's a matter of Iife and death.

1539
01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:24,776
-Nobody?
-I can't hear.

1540
01:17:25,028 --> 01:17:28,698
-Morningside 2469.
-You got who? Speak up. A what?

1541
01:17:28,948 --> 01:17:31,158
You can't stop for a dame now!

1542
01:17:31,868 --> 01:17:34,829
I don't care if you've been after her.
Lives are at stake!

1543
01:17:35,038 --> 01:17:37,165
You're going to Iet a woman
come between us?

1544
01:17:37,373 --> 01:17:40,042
Was there an oId Iady brought in
in a smashup?

1545
01:17:40,209 --> 01:17:42,878
Butch, I'd put my arm in fire
for you up to here.

1546
01:17:43,046 --> 01:17:44,464
You can't doubIe-cross me.

1547
01:17:44,672 --> 01:17:45,839
Look around, pIease.

1548
01:17:46,049 --> 01:17:48,176
AII right, put her on.
I'II taIk to her.

1549
01:17:48,384 --> 01:17:51,887
Good evening, madam. Now, Iisten,
you ten-cent gIamour girI...

1550
01:17:52,055 --> 01:17:54,515
...you can't keep Butch
from his duty. What?

1551
01:17:54,724 --> 01:17:57,393
You say that again,
I'II kick you in the teeth!

1552
01:17:57,602 --> 01:18:01,814
Say, what kind of Ianguage is that?
Now, Iook here, you--

1553
01:18:02,023 --> 01:18:04,233
She hung up. What did I say?

1554
01:18:05,401 --> 01:18:08,237
How do you Iike that?
Mousing around with some big--

1555
01:18:08,404 --> 01:18:11,907
-WiII you shut up? I'm trying to hear!
-That's cooperation.

1556
01:18:13,368 --> 01:18:15,161
WeII, where is Duffy?

1557
01:18:16,329 --> 01:18:19,540
Diabetes. I shouId know better than
to hire a diseased person.

1558
01:18:19,707 --> 01:18:22,000
-Give me OIympia 21 36, wiII you?
-Louie!

1559
01:18:22,210 --> 01:18:23,961
-Yes, boss.
-Louie, it's up to you.

1560
01:18:24,170 --> 01:18:26,714
-Anything you say, boss.
-Get a hoId of some guys.

1561
01:18:26,964 --> 01:18:30,300
Anybody with hair on his chest,
get them off the street.

1562
01:18:30,551 --> 01:18:31,885
We gotta get the desk out.

1563
01:18:32,053 --> 01:18:34,513
Is it important?
You're the best friend I got.

1564
01:18:34,764 --> 01:18:36,515
-I Iike you too.
-Don't faiI me.

1565
01:18:36,724 --> 01:18:38,684
Get enough peopIe to move that desk.

1566
01:18:38,935 --> 01:18:40,603
You know me.
Shirt off my back.

1567
01:18:40,812 --> 01:18:42,772
Okay, don't bump into anything.

1568
01:18:43,022 --> 01:18:46,608
-Dumb immigrant is sure to fIop on me.
-Try the hospitaI again.

1569
01:18:46,776 --> 01:18:49,153
If he's not back in five,
we'II carry it out aIone.

1570
01:18:49,362 --> 01:18:51,489
-Do anything you want.
-There's a miIIion-- CouId start a fire.

1571
01:18:51,656 --> 01:18:54,450
-We'II have the firemen take it out.
-I don't care what you do.

1572
01:18:54,659 --> 01:18:58,079
-Come here. See if we can Iift it.
-What? Nobody? Never mind.

1573
01:18:58,287 --> 01:18:59,830
-Are you gonna heIp me?
-No!

1574
01:18:59,998 --> 01:19:02,291
-I'II strain my back.
-I'II find Mrs. BaIdwin.

1575
01:19:02,542 --> 01:19:04,585
-Don't open it!
-I'II go to the morgue--

1576
01:19:04,794 --> 01:19:08,297
-We want to taIk to you a minute.
-Let go. What's the idea?

1577
01:19:08,548 --> 01:19:09,632
Get your hands off me!

1578
01:19:09,882 --> 01:19:11,800
-Now, Iook here, Johnson--
-Hey, you!

1579
01:19:11,968 --> 01:19:12,969
You mean me?

1580
01:19:13,177 --> 01:19:17,222
Yes, you. What do you mean by
breaking in here Iike this?

1581
01:19:17,432 --> 01:19:19,976
I don't care what paper
you're editor of.

1582
01:19:20,226 --> 01:19:23,562
Let go of me. Something's
happened to my mother-in-Iaw.

1583
01:19:23,813 --> 01:19:28,442
-We know what you are up to.
-She and MoIIie were in here taIking.

1584
01:19:28,651 --> 01:19:30,861
I know nothing,
and there's been an accident.

1585
01:19:31,070 --> 01:19:33,530
There's something
very pecuIiar going on here.

1586
01:19:33,740 --> 01:19:35,742
-See here--
-Just a moment, HartweII.

1587
01:19:35,908 --> 01:19:38,744
Make your accusations
in the proper manner.

1588
01:19:38,953 --> 01:19:41,038
Or I'II have to ask you to get out.

1589
01:19:41,247 --> 01:19:44,083
-Ask me to what?
-Get out.

1590
01:19:44,334 --> 01:19:48,171
You wiII, eh? Don't Iet anybody
in or out. We'II see about this.

1591
01:19:48,421 --> 01:19:51,257
-Give him the third degree.
-Make them taIk and you got him.

1592
01:19:51,466 --> 01:19:54,802
I'm going to get to the bottom of this.
Are you going to taIk?

1593
01:19:54,969 --> 01:19:57,805
-What do you want me to say?
-What do you know about WiIIiams?

1594
01:19:57,972 --> 01:19:59,932
Now we're getting some--

1595
01:20:00,141 --> 01:20:02,268
Take her out.
I got ways to make her taIk.

1596
01:20:02,477 --> 01:20:04,061
Don't you dare touch me or--

1597
01:20:04,854 --> 01:20:06,188
-She's got a gun!
-Grab it!

1598
01:20:06,397 --> 01:20:07,940
No, you don't. WaIter!

1599
01:20:08,149 --> 01:20:11,819
AII right, Burns.
I'II take that gun.

1600
01:20:11,986 --> 01:20:14,363
-Where did you get this?
-I can carry a gun.

1601
01:20:14,572 --> 01:20:16,323
-Not this gun.
-I can expIain it.

1602
01:20:16,532 --> 01:20:20,536
She was interviewing WiIIiams,
so I gave her a gun to defend herseIf.

1603
01:20:20,745 --> 01:20:24,665
Interesting. But this is the gun
that WiIIiams shot his way out with.

1604
01:20:24,874 --> 01:20:27,251
Good man, are you trying
to make me out a Iiar?

1605
01:20:27,502 --> 01:20:29,629
I ought to know my own gun,
oughtn't I--?

1606
01:20:29,796 --> 01:20:32,256
-That's where WiIIiams got it.
-She got it from him.

1607
01:20:32,507 --> 01:20:35,718
-Where's WiIIiams?
-You're barking up the wrong tree.

1608
01:20:35,927 --> 01:20:37,553
TeII me where he is.

1609
01:20:37,762 --> 01:20:41,432
At the hospitaI caIIing on Professor
EgeIhoffer with marshmaIIows.

1610
01:20:41,683 --> 01:20:44,686
-Where is he?
-Ask the mastermind why he's here.

1611
01:20:44,852 --> 01:20:47,771
-What do you know about this?
-My dear feIIow...

1612
01:20:47,939 --> 01:20:51,275
...the <i>Morning Post</i> doesn't obstruct
justice or hide criminaIs.

1613
01:20:51,484 --> 01:20:53,861
-You ought to know that.
-You're under arrest.

1614
01:20:54,070 --> 01:20:55,780
-You too.
-Who's under arrest?

1615
01:20:55,989 --> 01:20:58,282
Listen, you square-toed,
pimpIe-headed spy...

1616
01:20:58,533 --> 01:21:00,576
...do you reaIize what you're doing?

1617
01:21:00,785 --> 01:21:01,869
I'II show you.

1618
01:21:02,078 --> 01:21:04,121
You and the <i>Post</i>
are obstructing justice.

1619
01:21:04,372 --> 01:21:07,541
-I'II see that you're fined $1 0,000.
-You'II see nothing.

1620
01:21:07,750 --> 01:21:11,128
I'II begin by impounding the <i>Post</i>'s
property. Is this your desk?

1621
01:21:11,337 --> 01:21:14,423
What are you afraid of, HiIdy?
I dare you to move this desk.

1622
01:21:14,632 --> 01:21:16,342
-Go ahead, try it.
-I wiII.

1623
01:21:16,551 --> 01:21:19,887
I warn you, you move this desk out,
I'II put you behind bars.

1624
01:21:20,054 --> 01:21:22,598
-He can do it.
-I'II see RooseveIt hears about it.

1625
01:21:22,849 --> 01:21:24,225
TeII him. Come on, boys!

1626
01:21:24,434 --> 01:21:26,394
-Confiscate it.
-Last chance.

1627
01:21:26,644 --> 01:21:30,064
-This is a federaI offence.
-We'II take a chance on that.

1628
01:21:30,315 --> 01:21:31,399
AII right.

1629
01:21:32,442 --> 01:21:33,985
Open up this door!

1630
01:21:35,361 --> 01:21:38,947
-Mother! I'm gIad to see you--
-That's the man that did it. There.

1631
01:21:42,285 --> 01:21:45,288
-What's the idea here?
-She cIaims she's been kidnapped.

1632
01:21:45,496 --> 01:21:48,499
They dragged me down aII the way
down the stairs and--

1633
01:21:48,708 --> 01:21:49,792
Did he do it?

1634
01:21:50,043 --> 01:21:52,754
He was in charge.
He toId them to kidnap me.

1635
01:21:52,962 --> 01:21:55,506
Excuse me, madam.
Are you referring to me?

1636
01:21:55,757 --> 01:21:56,758
You know you did.

1637
01:21:57,008 --> 01:21:58,968
What about this? Kidnapping, huh?

1638
01:21:59,135 --> 01:22:02,388
Trying to frame me, huh?
I never saw her before in my Iife.

1639
01:22:02,597 --> 01:22:03,764
What a thing to say!

1640
01:22:03,973 --> 01:22:06,600
I was here when that girI
jumped out the window.

1641
01:22:06,809 --> 01:22:07,976
Get the mayor here.

1642
01:22:08,186 --> 01:22:10,813
Madam, be honest.
If you were out joyriding...

1643
01:22:11,022 --> 01:22:14,233
...pIastered, or in a scrape,
why not admit it instead of...

1644
01:22:14,442 --> 01:22:15,776
...accusing innocent peopIe?

1645
01:22:15,985 --> 01:22:18,654
You ruffian! How dare you taIk
Iike that to me!

1646
01:22:18,863 --> 01:22:19,947
He's crazy, Mother.

1647
01:22:20,198 --> 01:22:23,117
I'II teII you more.
I couId teII you why they did it.

1648
01:22:23,326 --> 01:22:25,870
They were hiding some
kind of murderer in here--

1649
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:27,538
Hiding him? In here?

1650
01:22:27,747 --> 01:22:30,416
Madam, you're a cockeyed Iiar...

1651
01:22:30,625 --> 01:22:32,418
...and you know it!

1652
01:22:33,252 --> 01:22:34,753
-What's that?
-He's in there!

1653
01:22:34,962 --> 01:22:36,672
-Give me the desk.
-What a break!

1654
01:22:36,839 --> 01:22:38,382
-Stand back.
-He might shoot.

1655
01:22:38,591 --> 01:22:39,675
-Guns out.
-He's harmIess.

1656
01:22:39,884 --> 01:22:43,220
-Don't take any chances.
-You've got his gun.

1657
01:22:43,471 --> 01:22:45,556
Go on, you grey-haired oId weaseI.

1658
01:22:45,765 --> 01:22:47,099
Let me out of here!

1659
01:22:47,517 --> 01:22:50,269
Mother! I was Iooking
aII over for you. What happened?

1660
01:22:50,436 --> 01:22:52,729
-Jake, hang on.
-HiIdy, caII Duffy.

1661
01:22:52,939 --> 01:22:54,649
-No!
-You want to see us scooped?

1662
01:22:54,857 --> 01:22:57,401
-Aim right for the centre.
-That's murder.

1663
01:22:57,610 --> 01:22:59,612
Okay, one of you get
on each end.

1664
01:22:59,779 --> 01:23:01,030
-It's coming up.
-You're covered.

1665
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:02,447
-In a minute.
-Don't move.

1666
01:23:02,699 --> 01:23:03,866
-Any time.
-On three.

1667
01:23:04,075 --> 01:23:06,035
-It's hot.
-Ready?

1668
01:23:06,202 --> 01:23:09,205
-Any second now.
-Three. I got you, WiIIiams.

1669
01:23:09,414 --> 01:23:11,457
-Go ahead, shoot me.
-Come out.

1670
01:23:11,708 --> 01:23:14,877
EarI WiIIiams just captured
in the criminaI courts buiIding.

1671
01:23:15,086 --> 01:23:17,880
-On your feet.
-Don't try any funny stuff.

1672
01:23:18,089 --> 01:23:19,465
WiIIiams was unconscious.

1673
01:23:19,632 --> 01:23:21,216
The poIice overpowered him.

1674
01:23:21,426 --> 01:23:24,595
-He offered no resistance.
-His gun wouIdn't work.

1675
01:23:25,221 --> 01:23:27,431
The <i>Post</i> turned WiIIiams
over to the sheriff.

1676
01:23:27,640 --> 01:23:29,433
-Put the cuffs on them.
-More Iater.

1677
01:23:29,642 --> 01:23:32,895
An anonymous note Ied to
WiIIiams' capture. HoId on.

1678
01:23:33,813 --> 01:23:36,357
The sheriff's tracing a caII
that gave away WiIIiams' hiding pIace.

1679
01:23:36,607 --> 01:23:38,650
-Where's the oId Iady?
-She went out.

1680
01:23:38,818 --> 01:23:40,194
CaII you back.

1681
01:23:49,537 --> 01:23:53,123
-Give me the warden's office.
-You'II wish you'd never been born.

1682
01:23:53,374 --> 01:23:54,792
Oh, am I?

1683
01:23:55,001 --> 01:23:57,128
-HeIIo, Fred.
-WeII, fine work, Pete.

1684
01:23:57,337 --> 01:24:00,089
-You deIivered the goods.
-Looks naturaI, don't it?

1685
01:24:00,298 --> 01:24:02,300
-Sight for sore eyes.
-Aiding a criminaI.

1686
01:24:02,508 --> 01:24:05,052
And a IittIe charge of kidnapping--
What's that?

1687
01:24:05,261 --> 01:24:06,428
But that's the jaiI.

1688
01:24:06,679 --> 01:24:09,723
Looks Iike about ten years apiece
for you two birds.

1689
01:24:09,891 --> 01:24:12,935
When you think you've Iicked the <i>Post</i>,
it's time to get out.

1690
01:24:13,144 --> 01:24:15,813
WhistIing in the dark won't heIp.
You're through.

1691
01:24:15,980 --> 01:24:19,483
Archie Leach said that to me
a week before he cut his throat.

1692
01:24:19,651 --> 01:24:20,652
Is that so?

1693
01:24:20,902 --> 01:24:23,988
We've been in worse jams than this,
haven't we, HiIdy?

1694
01:24:24,155 --> 01:24:26,782
You forget the power
that watches over the <i>Post.</i>

1695
01:24:26,991 --> 01:24:29,368
-It's not with you now.
-Says you.

1696
01:24:29,619 --> 01:24:31,245
I've caught him. Yes, WiIIiams.

1697
01:24:31,412 --> 01:24:34,289
SingIe-handed.
Proceed with the hanging, per scheduIe.

1698
01:24:34,499 --> 01:24:38,544
-You'II be in office two days more.
-We'II puII your nose out of that feedbag.

1699
01:24:38,753 --> 01:24:43,174
I teII you what you'II be doing.
Making brooms in the penitentiary.

1700
01:24:43,383 --> 01:24:44,634
Joe? This is HartweII.

1701
01:24:44,884 --> 01:24:46,510
Come to my office right away.

1702
01:24:46,678 --> 01:24:49,639
I captured some important birds.
Take their confessions.

1703
01:24:49,847 --> 01:24:50,931
Get Liebowitz.

1704
01:24:51,140 --> 01:24:55,352
-The Iawyers won't heIp you now.
-You're taIking to the <i>Morning Post.</i>

1705
01:24:55,812 --> 01:24:56,729
The power of the press?

1706
01:24:58,064 --> 01:25:01,317
Bigger men than you have found out
what the power of the press is.

1707
01:25:01,526 --> 01:25:02,693
Presidents, kings....

1708
01:25:02,860 --> 01:25:05,153
-Here's the reprieve.
-Get out.

1709
01:25:05,363 --> 01:25:07,990
-You can't bribe me. My wife--
-Get out.

1710
01:25:08,199 --> 01:25:11,035
-No, I won't. Here's the reprieve.
-What?

1711
01:25:11,202 --> 01:25:13,204
I don't want to be a city seaIer.

1712
01:25:13,371 --> 01:25:14,914
-Throw him out.
-Out you go.

1713
01:25:15,123 --> 01:25:16,999
Wait.
Who's trying to bribe you?

1714
01:25:17,250 --> 01:25:18,626
-They wouIdn't take it.
-Insane!

1715
01:25:18,835 --> 01:25:20,837
What did I say? An unseen power.

1716
01:25:21,045 --> 01:25:23,422
What do you mean with a story Iike that?

1717
01:25:23,631 --> 01:25:24,965
He's an impostor.

1718
01:25:25,133 --> 01:25:27,760
Trying to hang an innocent man
to win an eIection?

1719
01:25:27,927 --> 01:25:28,928
That's murder.

1720
01:25:29,178 --> 01:25:31,138
-I never saw him before.
-If I was to--

1721
01:25:31,306 --> 01:25:33,182
-What's your name?
-Pettibone.

1722
01:25:33,391 --> 01:25:35,935
-When did you deIiver this?
-Who'd you taIk to?

1723
01:25:36,144 --> 01:25:37,812
-They started to bribe me.
-They?

1724
01:25:37,979 --> 01:25:40,272
-Them.
-It's absurd on the face of it.

1725
01:25:40,481 --> 01:25:41,815
He's taIking Iike a chiId.

1726
01:25:42,025 --> 01:25:44,318
-Out of the mouths of babes.
-Hi, babe.

1727
01:25:44,569 --> 01:25:45,736
He's insane or drunk.

1728
01:25:45,987 --> 01:25:50,199
If WiIIiams has been reprieved,
I'm tickIed to death. Aren't you?

1729
01:25:50,366 --> 01:25:52,326
You'd hang your mother
to be reeIected.

1730
01:25:52,535 --> 01:25:54,828
That's a horribIe thing to say
about anybody.

1731
01:25:54,996 --> 01:25:57,289
You're marveIIous.
Take a Iook at that.

1732
01:25:57,498 --> 01:25:59,625
-You're an inteIIigent man.
-Never mind.

1733
01:25:59,834 --> 01:26:01,710
Let's have your story.

1734
01:26:01,919 --> 01:26:04,463
-Nineteen years ago, I married Mrs.--
-Skip that.

1735
01:26:04,672 --> 01:26:07,675
She wasn't Mrs. Pettibone then.
She was one of the--

1736
01:26:07,842 --> 01:26:11,345
This document is authentic.
WiIIiams has been reprieved.

1737
01:26:11,596 --> 01:26:15,099
Our commonweaIth has been saved
the necessity of shedding bIood.

1738
01:26:15,266 --> 01:26:18,185
Get off the soapbox.
Save that for <i>Th</i>e <i>Tribun</i>e.

1739
01:26:18,353 --> 01:26:20,229
Take those handcuffs off my friends.

1740
01:26:20,438 --> 01:26:22,648
-I'm amazed at you.
-Isn't he awfuI?

1741
01:26:22,857 --> 01:26:25,150
You don't know how badIy I feeI.

1742
01:26:25,401 --> 01:26:27,236
No excuse at aII for Pete.

1743
01:26:27,445 --> 01:26:29,655
-I was onIy doing my duty.
-That's aII right.

1744
01:26:29,864 --> 01:26:32,241
-What'd you say your name was?
-Pettibone.

1745
01:26:32,450 --> 01:26:34,743
-Here's a picture of my wife.
-Fine woman.

1746
01:26:34,952 --> 01:26:36,995
-You haven't seen her.
-She's aII right.

1747
01:26:37,163 --> 01:26:39,915
She's good enough for me.
If I was to teII--

1748
01:26:40,124 --> 01:26:43,710
I understand perfectIy, and
as Iong as I'm mayor--

1749
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:45,713
Which shouId be about three hours.

1750
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:48,632
Enough to get out an edition
asking for your recaII.

1751
01:26:48,841 --> 01:26:52,511
And your arrest. You boys
ought to get about ten years apiece.

1752
01:26:52,720 --> 01:26:56,724
Don't make any hasty decisions.
You might run into a IibeI suit.

1753
01:26:56,891 --> 01:27:01,353
-You'II run into the governor.
-We understand each other perfectIy.

1754
01:27:01,562 --> 01:27:03,230
Yes, and so do I.

1755
01:27:03,398 --> 01:27:06,192
So do you what?
And now, Mr. Pettibone...

1756
01:27:06,401 --> 01:27:09,904
...we'II deIiver this reprieve
to the warden's office. Come aIong.

1757
01:27:10,113 --> 01:27:13,199
-If I was to teII my wife--
-You won't have to.

1758
01:27:14,826 --> 01:27:17,286
Wait tiII they read
the <i>Morning Post</i> tomorrow.

1759
01:27:17,495 --> 01:27:18,496
Tight squeeze.

1760
01:27:18,746 --> 01:27:21,039
-Give me Duffy.
-That's our worst jam.

1761
01:27:21,249 --> 01:27:22,833
What? Where? Get him.

1762
01:27:23,042 --> 01:27:26,128
Remember steaIing oId Iady Haggerty's
stomach from the coroner?

1763
01:27:26,337 --> 01:27:28,630
Any time you need this guy
he's never there.

1764
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:31,050
We proved she'd been poisoned,
didn't we?

1765
01:27:31,301 --> 01:27:34,262
We had to hide out for a week.
Do you remember that?

1766
01:27:34,470 --> 01:27:37,723
The ShoreIand HoteI.
That's how we happened to--

1767
01:27:37,890 --> 01:27:40,017
We couId have gone
to jaiI for that too.

1768
01:27:40,226 --> 01:27:43,145
Yes, maybe you're right, HiIdy.
It's a bad business.

1769
01:27:43,354 --> 01:27:46,398
You'II be better off.
You better get going.

1770
01:27:46,607 --> 01:27:49,151
-Where wouId I go?
-To Bruce, of course.

1771
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:52,071
-You know he's gone. He took a train.
-Send a wire.

1772
01:27:52,238 --> 01:27:55,115
He'II be at the station
when you get into AIbany.

1773
01:27:55,325 --> 01:27:58,911
-Why doesn't he have a phone?
-I don't know. I got us messed up--

1774
01:27:59,162 --> 01:28:02,582
-Get going, HiIdy.
-What is that with you?

1775
01:28:02,832 --> 01:28:05,459
Wait a minute.
Can't you understand?

1776
01:28:05,668 --> 01:28:09,338
I'm trying to do something nobIe.
Get out before I change my mind.

1777
01:28:09,505 --> 01:28:10,672
It's tough enough now.

1778
01:28:10,923 --> 01:28:13,759
-Just a minute.
-Send him a wire. He'II be waiting.

1779
01:28:13,926 --> 01:28:16,887
-Who'II write the story?
-I wiII. It won't be as good--

1780
01:28:17,096 --> 01:28:19,389
It's my story.
I Iike to think that it--

1781
01:28:19,599 --> 01:28:22,935
-At Iast.
-I get it. The same oId act, isn't it?

1782
01:28:23,186 --> 01:28:25,730
Try to push me out,
thinking I'II want to stay.

1783
01:28:25,938 --> 01:28:28,607
I know I deserve that.
Wait a minute, Duffy.

1784
01:28:28,775 --> 01:28:30,193
This time you're wrong.

1785
01:28:30,401 --> 01:28:33,779
When you waIk out that door,
part of me wiII go right with you.

1786
01:28:33,988 --> 01:28:36,281
But a whoIe new worId
wiII open up for you.

1787
01:28:36,491 --> 01:28:39,035
I made fun of Bruce and AIbany.
You know why?

1788
01:28:39,285 --> 01:28:40,619
-Why?
-I was jeaIous.

1789
01:28:40,787 --> 01:28:44,624
I was sore because he couId offer you
the kind of Iife I can't give you.

1790
01:28:44,832 --> 01:28:46,166
That's what you want, honey.

1791
01:28:46,376 --> 01:28:48,419
I couId do the story
and take the train--

1792
01:28:48,628 --> 01:28:51,172
Forget it. Come on. Come on.

1793
01:28:51,422 --> 01:28:53,215
Goodbye, dear, and good Iuck.

1794
01:28:57,303 --> 01:29:00,556
Duffy, now this is how
it goes so far--

1795
01:29:00,765 --> 01:29:02,266
Just a minute.

1796
01:29:03,267 --> 01:29:05,727
HeIIo. Who? HiIdy Johnson?

1797
01:29:05,979 --> 01:29:08,439
-She just Ieft.
-I'm stiII here. I can take it.

1798
01:29:08,648 --> 01:29:10,066
Hang on a minute.

1799
01:29:12,151 --> 01:29:13,986
HiIdy Johnson speaking.

1800
01:29:14,904 --> 01:29:17,197
The 4th Precinct poIice station?

1801
01:29:17,448 --> 01:29:18,615
Put him on.

1802
01:29:19,575 --> 01:29:23,161
I thought you were on your
way to AIbany-- What for?

1803
01:29:23,538 --> 01:29:25,498
For having counterfeit money.

1804
01:29:25,707 --> 01:29:27,083
Counterfeit money?

1805
01:29:27,291 --> 01:29:28,750
HoId on a minute.

1806
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:30,503
Where did you get it?

1807
01:29:30,712 --> 01:29:32,422
I gave it to you?

1808
01:29:32,964 --> 01:29:36,717
AII right.
I'II try and do something about it.

1809
01:29:47,562 --> 01:29:48,938
Honey.

1810
01:29:49,647 --> 01:29:51,857
Honey, don't cry, pIease.

1811
01:29:52,066 --> 01:29:55,819
I didn't mean to make you cry.
What's wrong? You never cried before.

1812
01:29:57,322 --> 01:30:01,242
I thought you were reaIIy
sending me away with Bruce.

1813
01:30:02,785 --> 01:30:05,078
I didn't know you had him Iocked up.

1814
01:30:05,705 --> 01:30:08,833
I thought you were
on the IeveI, for once.

1815
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:12,586
That you were just standing by
and Ietting me go off with him...

1816
01:30:12,795 --> 01:30:14,880
...and not doing a thing about it.

1817
01:30:15,089 --> 01:30:17,716
Come on, honey. What did you
think I was, a chump?

1818
01:30:17,925 --> 01:30:20,135
I thought you didn't Iove me.

1819
01:30:20,345 --> 01:30:21,971
What were you thinking with?

1820
01:30:22,180 --> 01:30:23,514
I don't know.

1821
01:30:24,474 --> 01:30:27,185
What are you standing
there gawking for?

1822
01:30:27,393 --> 01:30:29,520
We have to get him out of jaiI.

1823
01:30:29,771 --> 01:30:32,064
Send Louie down
with some honest money...

1824
01:30:32,273 --> 01:30:34,066
...and send him back to AIbany.

1825
01:30:34,275 --> 01:30:35,526
Sure.

1826
01:30:36,194 --> 01:30:39,447
Everything's changed.
We're coming over to the office.

1827
01:30:39,614 --> 01:30:42,325
Don't worry about the story.
HiIdy wiII write it.

1828
01:30:42,533 --> 01:30:45,160
She never intended to quit.
We're getting married.

1829
01:30:45,370 --> 01:30:48,581
-Can we go on a honeymoon this time?
-Sure.

1830
01:30:48,790 --> 01:30:51,709
Duffy, you can be managing editor.

1831
01:30:51,876 --> 01:30:54,795
Not permanentIy.
Just for the two weeks we're away.

1832
01:30:55,004 --> 01:30:56,880
I don't know where.
Where are we going?

1833
01:30:57,090 --> 01:30:58,591
Niagara FaIIs.

1834
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:01,010
-Niagara FaIIs.
-Two whoIe weeks?

1835
01:31:01,219 --> 01:31:04,055
Sure, you've earned it. What?

1836
01:31:04,222 --> 01:31:07,475
What? A strike? What strike?

1837
01:31:07,725 --> 01:31:09,935
Where? AIbany?

1838
01:31:10,103 --> 01:31:13,523
-I know it's on the way, but--
-Okay, we'II honeymoon in AIbany.

1839
01:31:13,731 --> 01:31:15,190
Okay, Duffy.

1840
01:31:15,900 --> 01:31:18,944
Isn't that a coincidence!
I wonder if Bruce can put us up.

1841
01:31:19,153 --> 01:31:21,446
Say, why don't you carry that
in your hand?
