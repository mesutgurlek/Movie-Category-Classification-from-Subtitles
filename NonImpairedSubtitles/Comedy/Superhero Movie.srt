1 
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:53,648 
Who am I? 

2 
00:02:53,748 --> 00:02:58,386 
Do you know this? 
Actually I am a nobody. 

3 
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:02,535 
I'm even worse than a nobody. 
I am this guy. 

4 
00:03:02,635 --> 00:03:04,846 
Stop the bus. 

5 
00:03:17,028 --> 00:03:19,700 
My life is not for straight. 

6 
00:03:19,735 --> 00:03:21,700 
Thank you. 

7 
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:26,165 
But, well worth the telling, 
because it is a girl. 

8 
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:29,459 
Not that girl. 

9 
00:03:30,504 --> 00:03:33,056 
I do not think that a girl. 

10 
00:03:33,091 --> 00:03:37,271 
No, it is about this girl. 
Jill Johnson. 

11 
00:03:37,306 --> 00:03:40,435 
As long as I can remember, 
I'm already in love with her. 

12 
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:44,363 
But they barely know that I exist. 
-- Rick, come here, dude. 

13 
00:03:44,397 --> 00:03:47,527 
I have a rather clear. 
I'll call you back. Okay, day. 

14 
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:48,804 
What's up, dude? 
-- Hello Trey. 

15 
00:03:48,904 --> 00:03:53,869 
I'm so excited for this school, 
advanced things we are going to see. 

16 
00:03:55,537 --> 00:03:56,898 
I think that is only good. 

17 
00:03:56,997 --> 00:03:58,775 
Do you have C batteries with you? AA? 

18 
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:02,087 
I have this new sandwich Sony 
in my backpack, it's a Wi-Fi. 

19 
00:04:03,839 --> 00:04:08,304 
You have forgotten her, dude. 
Look, I will show you something. 

20 
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,273 
She even looks to you. 

21 
00:04:11,308 --> 00:04:14,103 
If I could tell her but 
what I feel for her. 

22 
00:04:14,138 --> 00:04:16,864 
I've already told you, 
it never gets what about Jill. 

23 
00:04:16,898 --> 00:04:21,529 
She draws on the popular gang 
and there is no outsider. 

24 
00:04:21,563 --> 00:04:23,306 
Come on, that bendegedoe is not real. 

25 
00:04:23,405 --> 00:04:25,409 
That you think. 
Look around you, Rick. 

26 
00:04:25,444 --> 00:04:27,496 
Look, there you have the Jacks, 

27 
00:04:27,531 --> 00:04:28,689 
the Nerds, 

28 
00:04:28,789 --> 00:04:30,616 
the Immos, 

29 
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,443 
the Frodos, 

30 
00:04:32,543 --> 00:04:35,171 
the Scarfacegezelschap, 

31 
00:04:35,207 --> 00:04:37,765 
sexual predators ... 

32 
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,604 
and even Rick-meppers. 
-- The who? 

33 
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:44,309 
Yes, those are new. 
But what does it matter? 

34 
00:04:44,344 --> 00:04:46,945 
Because we have our own gang, me and you. 

35 
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:50,525 
Thanks Trey, you're the best. 
-- Am I there? 

36 
00:04:50,561 --> 00:04:52,051 
No. 
-- Come now. 

37 
00:04:52,152 --> 00:04:54,250 
You and me, baby. 
We two against the rest, okay. 

38 
00:04:54,285 --> 00:04:56,348 
You look good today. 
It is her good. 

39 
00:04:56,449 --> 00:04:59,662 
I ga you something disgusting show 
I have downloaded. Not more telling. 

40 
00:05:01,999 --> 00:05:04,467 
Welcome to Amalgamated. 
I'm Dr. Strom, 

41 
00:05:04,501 --> 00:05:08,632 
Head of the Department of Research, 
where we create the future, today. 

42 
00:05:08,667 --> 00:05:12,394 
And now let me show you our crown jewel. 

43 
00:05:12,429 --> 00:05:17,352 
The Amalgamated laboratory 
of the dierengenetica. 

44 
00:05:17,387 --> 00:05:19,646 
Ga assured exploration. 

45 
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:27,323 
All the animals were genetically manufactured 
and each animal has its unique characteristics. 

46 
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:29,843 
What are you beautiful. 

47 
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:32,330 
Hello, birdie. 

48 
00:05:32,913 --> 00:05:35,668 
Hello. 

49 
00:05:36,376 --> 00:05:41,049 
She is beautiful, do not you think? 
-- Yes, that she is sure. 

50 
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:45,269 
I will make a photograph of her 
for the schooljournaal. 

51 
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:51,813 
Our only rules: the animals do not enter 
and make no pictures with flash. 

52 
00:05:51,848 --> 00:05:56,277 
Most of our animals 
are hypersensitive to light. 

53 
00:05:58,822 --> 00:06:01,368 
They flew away. 

54 
00:06:09,044 --> 00:06:12,764 
What was that, pummel. 
-- Pak him, Lance. 

55 
00:06:12,799 --> 00:06:17,179 
Come now, Lance, let him alone. 
-- That you thought. 

56 
00:06:17,215 --> 00:06:20,618 
Is there a problem, Lance? 

57 
00:06:20,653 --> 00:06:24,022 
No, no problem, Uncle Lou. 

58 
00:06:24,056 --> 00:06:25,674 
Mr. Landers. 

59 
00:06:25,774 --> 00:06:29,529 
Students, this is Lou Landers, 
visionary scientist ... 

60 
00:06:29,564 --> 00:06:31,914 
and CEO of Amalgamated. 

61 
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:34,375 
Well, I'm simply a businessman now. 

62 
00:06:34,411 --> 00:06:39,001 
The future of science 
belongs to you all. 

63 
00:06:39,035 --> 00:06:42,045 
Enjoy the tour. 

64 
00:06:49,596 --> 00:06:54,937 
What's up with you? 
-- Yes, this is healthy hoestbloed. 

65 
00:06:56,105 --> 00:06:57,341 
Rick Riker. 

66 
00:06:57,441 --> 00:07:01,112 
Are you not coincidentally the son 
of Blaine and Julia Riker? 

67 
00:07:01,146 --> 00:07:02,430 
Yes, that's right. 

68 
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,831 
Good people, what's new with them? 

69 
00:07:04,867 --> 00:07:09,288 
She died nine years ago. 
-- But for the rest everything okay? 

70 
00:07:09,324 --> 00:07:12,426 
Yes, thank you. 
Now I live with my aunt and uncle. 

71 
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,722 
You seem from the same stuff 
if your uncle. 

72 
00:07:15,756 --> 00:07:19,761 
Let us hope that ultimately you 
even murdered. 

73 
00:07:24,934 --> 00:07:30,191 
That's because you've put me laughing. 
The next time I'm your pain. 

74 
00:07:35,698 --> 00:07:39,119 
Our work with these animals helped us 
to develop new antibiotics, 

75 
00:07:39,154 --> 00:07:43,226 
advanced pesticides 
and a powerful, new pheromone, 

76 
00:07:43,261 --> 00:07:47,297 
that the animals impetus to couples, 
compound called H2O-9. 

77 
00:07:47,332 --> 00:07:49,891 
It delivers a strong, 
sexual attraction. 

78 
00:07:49,925 --> 00:07:53,262 
A single drop is sufficient 
make an impact on ... 

79 
00:07:53,297 --> 00:07:56,350 
We want to use it 
to multiply ... 

80 
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:06,279 
One promising research 
we do in these dragonflies. 

81 
00:08:11,996 --> 00:08:16,001 
And this has libelsoort 
an enormous strength for his size. 

82 
00:08:16,035 --> 00:08:19,673 
Keep it tight boys, I come out. 

83 
00:08:22,676 --> 00:08:25,263 
We have the DNA of these 
three libelsoorten injected ... 

84 
00:08:25,298 --> 00:08:30,477 
in seven new 
superlibellen genetically improved. 

85 
00:08:30,512 --> 00:08:32,822 
There are only six. 

86 
00:08:32,856 --> 00:08:36,194 
Well, one missing libel 
is the least of my concerns. 

87 
00:08:36,228 --> 00:08:39,197 
This month I have lost six tigers. 

88 
00:08:43,411 --> 00:08:47,042 
In this space, we keep our wildlife. 

89 
00:08:55,302 --> 00:09:00,683 
Would you not do something? 
-- Once I've put it on YouTube. 

90 
00:09:01,935 -> 00:09:05,148 
Pak, slut. 

91 
00:09:06,483 --> 00:09:12,366 
I understand it. Yes, of course. 
Thanks for calling. 

92 
00:09:13,826 --> 00:09:18,144 
That was the director. 
Rick walked away from a school trip. 

93 
00:09:18,178 --> 00:09:22,427 
After such a long upbringing 
he is still so unsettled. 

94 
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:27,886 
Why do you think so, Albert? 
-- I have no idea, Lucille. 

95 
00:09:27,921 --> 00:09:30,813 
And I taught him everything 
what I know about the man. 

96 
00:09:30,847 --> 00:09:35,436 
And a good man are you, 
after all these years that we are married. 

97 
00:09:35,472 --> 00:09:37,655 
Like on that first day. 

98 
00:09:37,690 -> 00:09:40,993 
You're probably already have some age. 
-- And your hair is gray. 

99 
00:09:41,028 --> 00:09:45,415 
You've kraaiepootjes. 
-- You have one hour needed to pass urine. 

100 
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:50,123 
Your thighs look like cottage cheese 
overgaf someone on a hot sidewalk. 

101 
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:53,794 
And you had always been a small penis. 

102 
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:58,760 
Well, what does it helps if you're in love. 

103 
00:10:02,097 --> 00:10:08,564 
Rick, we already asked us where you were. 
You're so late. 

104 
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:13,202 
It was time that you are at home, 
your aunt was becoming worried. 

105 
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:19,286 
You may continue late into the morning sleeping, 
but do not forget to eat the fish. 

106 
00:10:19,321 --> 00:10:22,081 
Well done, my boy. 

107 
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:27,963 
I do not know what saves, 
but you seem not quite okay today. 

108 
00:10:27,998 --> 00:10:32,095 
Teenagers, I will talk with him. 

109 
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:39,027 
Heavy day, huh? 
Well, I ga not lie to you, 

110 
00:10:39,062 --> 00:10:42,983 
puberty is a difficult time 
in the life of a young man. 

111 
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:46,171 
Perhaps this book will explain 
what is going on. 

112 
00:10:46,207 --> 00:10:49,325 
Once look, mood swings, 
vochtophouding ... 

113 
00:10:49,361 --> 00:10:52,610 
and once a month you from your vagina bleeding. 

114 
00:10:52,644 --> 00:10:55,858 
This is likely to be 
the wrong book can be. 

115 
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,962 
The important thing is that you 
on the verge of adulthood are. 

116 
00:10:58,996 --> 00:11:02,182 
Here, take a drink. 

117 
00:11:02,216 --> 00:11:06,138 
The rites of masculinity. 
Today you drink your first beer ... 

118 
00:11:06,174 --> 00:11:09,601 
and tomorrow we can besnijden. 

119 
00:11:18,529 --> 00:11:20,831 
My patience is running out, Dr. Strom. 

120 
00:11:20,866 --> 00:11:22,810 
If you just a few minutes 
could wait ... 

121 
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,562 
I've had long enough 
egomaniak waited for this. 

122 
00:11:24,663 --> 00:11:27,124 
We are the Board of Directors, 
our time is valuable. 

123 
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,425 
Not so valuable as my time, Mr. Carlson. 

124 
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:35,175 
You see, I have a terminal illness 
and I are fighting for years against. 

125 
00:11:35,211 --> 00:11:39,032 
But the disease has affected my organs. 

126 
00:11:39,068 --> 00:11:42,853 
At this moment I have one hour to live. 

127 
00:11:45,106 --> 00:11:47,651 
It was in advertising. 

128 
00:11:48,652 --> 00:11:54,452 
Gentlemen, if you are ready, 
allow me then to show you the future. 

129 
00:11:56,705 --> 00:12:00,674 
What should this? 
-- An innovation. 

130 
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:04,923 
It will not only save my life, 
but also the life of this company. 

131 
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:08,762 
Too long have we try to make profit 
with pills and injections, 

132 
00:12:08,796 --> 00:12:11,307 
while the fate of the large total healing. 

133 
00:12:11,342 --> 00:12:14,192 
A device that can alter DNA, 

134 
00:12:14,227 --> 00:12:16,088 
and the body are perfect health 
can return. 

135 
00:12:16,188 --> 00:12:20,172 
You're crazy. 
-- No, crazy is hearing voices, 

136 
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:24,156 
with cats talk, 
in step with Paula Abdul. 

137 
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:28,252 
I'm not crazy, I am a visionary. 

138 
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:31,373 
The machine was never fully tested. 
If something goes wrong ... 

139 
00:12:31,409 --> 00:12:34,712 
Start the machine. 
-- Yes sir. 

140 
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:42,289 
Plasmaniveaus stable, 

141 
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:46,060 
genetic adaptations to optimum level. 

142 
00:12:46,096 --> 00:12:48,768 
Sir, the core becomes overheated. 

143 
00:12:48,804 --> 00:12:51,442 
We have to abort the process. 

144 
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,663 
Is it successful? 

145 
00:13:00,698 --> 00:13:03,124 
I'm sorry. 

146 
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:10,508 
I want you know what pleasure it will be 
to lead this company without you, and ... 

147 
00:13:11,802 --> 00:13:15,140 
Let loose, let me loose. 

148 
00:13:37,501 --> 00:13:42,216 
Gentlemen, it is time 
we agree that what occurred. 

149 
00:14:01,532 --> 00:14:05,498 
How long have I slept? 
-- Five days. 

150 
00:14:27,442 --> 00:14:31,823 
'libellenbeet' 
-- 'How can MDnet help you today? " 

151 
00:14:31,858 --> 00:14:34,374 
'1. I have headaches 2. I'm cold ' 

152 
00:14:34,408 --> 00:14:40,376 
'3. I want to understand what Britney wrong

'No'

'Have you ever had sexual intercourse? "

'Yes'

'Lie not against me'

00:14:56,188 --> 00:14:57,173 
"I do not lie '

I am a doctor. " 

160

Search me. " 

163 
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:17,757 
"I come to you." 

164 
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,757 
Wait.

Papa. 

167 
00:15:36,908 --> 00:15:40,244 
I thought you would live forever. 

168 
00:16:21,382 --> 00:16:27,974 
Breakfast is ready. 
-- I come down immediately. 

169 
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:42,165 
Can I see your attention. 
'Wetenschapsbeurs' 

170 
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:46,045 
We have the pleasure to 
as a guest juror to have 

171 
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:51,754 
the principal scientist in the world, 
Professor at the Empire City University, 

172 
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:54,390 
where he has the rare substance Cerillium works, 

173 
00:16:54,425 --> 00:17:00,015 
I'm so proud to welcome him, 
Dr. Stephen Hawking. 

174 
00:17:05,021 --> 00:17:07,281 
Thank you for that warm welcome. 

175 
00:17:07,316 --> 00:17:10,076 
I have a disease that has paralyzed me. 

176 
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:14,081 
I can not walk and 
I use this computer to speak. 

177 
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:19,081 
But I'm not discouraged 
because I have the gift of science. 

178 
00:17:19,116 --> 00:17:23,552 
That is a lie, 
I think every day to suicide. 

179 
00:17:23,586 --> 00:17:26,613 
But you should rejoice 
with your life. 

180 
00:17:26,648 --> 00:17:30,854 
You can walk, talk, 
afkuisen your own ass ... 

181 
00:17:30,888 --> 00:17:35,026 
and sex experience. 
I have many years no longer had sex. 

182 
00:17:35,061 --> 00:17:40,296 
My nurse is a lesbian 
and it is not the hottest. 

183 
00:17:40,331 --> 00:17:45,498 
Hey, who would be high? 
I have some hashish in their pocket. 

184 
00:17:45,533 --> 00:17:50,998 
Blanke guy with the dreadlocks, 
you know what I am talking about. 

185 
00:17:51,032 --> 00:17:53,706 
Nobody? 

186 
00:17:53,741 --> 00:17:56,379 
Mietjes. 

187 
00:18:09,397 --> 00:18:13,652 
Watch out where you are in slow-motion runs, acorn. 

188 
00:18:16,031 --> 00:18:19,083 
Ga to her, idiot. 

189 
00:18:19,118 --> 00:18:22,289 
Tell her what you feel for her. 

190 
00:18:45,194 --> 00:18:47,864 
He was. 

191 
00:18:51,327 --> 00:18:55,957 
You're there. 
-- Lance, love it. 

192 
00:18:55,992 --> 00:18:59,003 
High, high, high. 

193 
00:20:35,587 --> 00:20:38,882 
Ga from the road. 
No brakes. 

194 
00:20:41,385 --> 00:20:43,639 
Ga from the road. 

195 
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,726 
Madam, watch out. 

196 
00:21:04,421 --> 00:21:05,615 
How do you ...? 

197 
00:21:05,715 --> 00:21:07,911 
I can not believe what you just 
the old lady have saved her life. 

198 
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:09,246 
Amazingly. 

199 
00:21:09,347 --> 00:21:14,898 
Had I not pushed from the road 
then she was probably dead. 

200 
00:21:24,624 --> 00:21:29,091 
You would really be proud of yourself. 
-- You are a kind of hero. 

201 
00:21:29,126 --> 00:21:31,595 
Can you tell me apologize? 

202 
00:21:34,308 --> 00:21:37,564 
Voila. Really kind of you 
for me to come help, Trey. 

203 
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:41,405 
No problem! 
I was still waiting to Rick. 

204 
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,714 
My god, how did you do that? 

205 
00:21:47,749 -> 00:21:51,382 
It is simpler than it seems. 

206 
00:21:55,889 --> 00:21:57,709 
No, I do not think so. 

207 
00:21:57,809 --> 00:22:00,947 
Why do not you show me what is going on? 

208 
00:22:00,982 --> 00:22:06,616 
Okay then, there is something, 
but you must keep the secret. 

209 
00:22:06,651 --> 00:22:12,050 
I think I have superpowers. 

210 
00:22:12,085 --> 00:22:15,347 
I can feel difficult. 
-- Okay, what do you think of it. 

211 
00:22:15,382 --> 00:22:18,513 
You may get as many times as you like 
but I'll bet you 100 dollars ... 

212 
00:22:18,548 --> 00:22:21,226 
that you never touches me. 

213 
00:22:22,687 --> 00:22:26,410 
Easy earned. 
What can you do all? 

214 
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:29,825 
Well, I do not know, 
I am bitten by a libel. 

215 
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:33,123 
Some dragonflies have an armed skin. 

216 
00:22:33,158 --> 00:22:36,713 
I wonder whether my skin also ... 

217 
00:22:37,214 --> 00:22:40,261 
Well, fortunately that worked well. 

218 
00:22:40,637 --> 00:22:44,734 
So you really have superpowers. 
We can form a team. 

219 
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:48,776 
Then we are famous, get a lot of money ... 
-- Forget the chicks. 

220 
00:22:48,812 --> 00:22:52,321 
We will not be famous 
and there will be no chicks. 

221 
00:22:52,357 --> 00:22:55,831 
Okay, so I have not asked. 
I have been like everyone else. 

222 
00:22:55,866 --> 00:22:59,003 
That is not what your parents wanted for you. 

223 
00:22:59,547 --> 00:23:00,823 
You're not my father. 

224 
00:23:00,924 --> 00:23:04,806 
But I love you like your father! 
I believe in you like your father. 

225 
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:09,063 
I had sex with your mother like your father. 

226 
00:23:09,098 --> 00:23:12,695 
You'll never understand me. Never. 

227 
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:30,729 
That is not what your parents wanted for you. 

228 
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,618 
What a fantastic action. 

229 
00:23:35,653 --> 00:23:39,160 
Well Rick, have you enjoyed the opera? 

230 
00:23:39,195 --> 00:23:41,880 
Son, is something you cross? 

231 
00:23:41,915 --> 00:23:44,718 
It's so unfair, they have nothing. 

232 
00:23:44,753 --> 00:23:48,476 
I want things to change. 
-- And that'll do. 

233 
00:23:48,511 --> 00:23:51,975 
One day, Rick, people will ask you 
to be a hero. 

234 
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:55,147 
When that day comes, 
you will then be ready for his? 

235 
00:23:55,182 --> 00:23:57,009 
Give me your wallet. 

236 
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,470 
And that, too. 

237 
00:24:00,907 --> 00:24:03,997 
people will ask you ... 
to be a hero. 

238 
00:24:04,032 -> 00:24:07,086 
When that day comes, 
you will then be ready for his? 

239 
00:24:23,616 --> 00:24:25,995 
Rick, please. 

240 
00:24:36,388 --> 00:24:39,485 
Rick, I'm on the die. 
-- No. 

241 
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,734 
But do not worry, 
my brother Albert will you adopt. 

242 
00:24:42,769 --> 00:24:45,954 
Rick, the money is all yours. 

243 
00:24:45,989 --> 00:24:50,163 
Sell all shares of the company 
called Google, it is worth nothing. 

244 
00:24:50,198 --> 00:24:53,552 
Invest in Enron. 

245 
00:24:53,587 --> 00:24:56,676 
Rick, I have something for you. 

246 
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:58,888 
Taste in my pocket. 

247 
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:02,895 
The other pocket. 

248 
00:25:07,612 --> 00:25:11,578 
That ring was my father 
and his father before him. 

249 
00:25:11,612 --> 00:25:14,375 
Earn it, Rick. 
Be a hero. 

250 
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:16,586 
Eis you ... 

251

I'm not a superhero, I am a niemendal. 

254 
00:25:51,399 --> 00:25:54,203 
Is everything okay? 
-- What, have you heard that? 

255 
00:25:54,237 --> 00:25:56,993 
You have nothing else 
than an ugly and ungrateful whore, 

256 
00:25:57,028 --> 00:25:59,421 
Like your mother. 

257 
00:25:59,456 --> 00:26:02,135 
Who was that? 
-- My mother. 

258 
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:04,616 
Listen, what about this morning 
happened at school, I ... 

259 
00:26:04,716 --> 00:26:08,305 
You made us really scared. 
-- I ga rather through a difficult period now. 

260 
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:12,939 
Me too. My parents, like 
I looked at the college ga, but ... 

261 
00:26:12,974 --> 00:26:14,716 
I want dancer. 

262 
00:26:14,817 --> 00:26:16,679 
I believe in you. 

263 
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:19,041 
You really believes in me, huh? 

264 
00:26:19,076 --> 00:26:21,497 
I wish I could say the same of Lance. 

265 
00:26:21,532 --> 00:26:23,150 
I do not know, is he really the true ... 

266 
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:26,255 
or ga I was only with him 
to me against my father to do? 

267 
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:27,699 
He does not want any boy in my neighborhood.

Therefore, he schrikdraad put on the fence.

Well, we'll see. 
You can not escape your fate.

Correct? 
-- Right.

One day I might take them 
for a ride on your car?

00:26:50,757 --> 00:26:54,347 
Yes, sure.

-- Well, I will wait here. 

292 
00:28:10,902 --> 00:28:13,683 
I have reviewed your application for a car loan 
checked, Mr. Riker, but ... 

293

no job, no credit history ... 
I am afraid I have to say no.

But, what is it?

appears to be quite popular.

Listen, I have to buy a car.

Frankly, Mr. Riker, you are the worst 
candidate we've ever had. 

299

Thanks for the loan, Mr. Johnson.

00:29:03,582 --> 00:29:06,170 
Hey, I just made the same mistake 
when I arrived. 

309 
00:29:06,204 --> 00:29:08,171 
Thank you. 

310 
00:29:09,635 --> 00:29:12,911 
You idiot, you let him go ervandoor 
with our money. 

311 
00:29:12,945 --> 00:29:16,187 
I do not see why 
that my problem should be. 

312 
00:29:22,491 --> 00:29:25,371 
Come here, you see. 

313 
00:29:25,406 --> 00:29:27,751 
Let me through it. 

314 
00:29:31,466 --> 00:29:35,222 
Fortunately, I thought 
that something extraordinary had happened. 

315 
00:29:35,257 --> 00:29:38,562 
Well, there is an old guy back. 

316 
00:29:42,235 --> 00:29:44,997 
Uncle Albert. 
Try to breathe. 

317 
00:29:45,032 --> 00:29:48,580 
That does not, you kneels on my balls. 

318 
00:29:48,615 --> 00:29:50,442 
Sorry. 

319 
00:29:50,541 --> 00:29:56,219 
Rick, listen, you get great strength ... 

320 
00:29:56,512 --> 00:29:59,976 
Great responsibility? 
-- I wanted it to chicks, but ... 

321 
00:30:00,011 --> 00:30:02,772 
if you want to remain a virgin 
for the rest of your life ... 

322 
00:30:02,808 --> 00:30:05,568 
Uncle Albert.

Erin, is ga, ga it. 

329 
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:04,927 
Okay, I do come back. 

330 
00:31:23,043 --> 00:31:26,222 
I came as soon as I learned. 
-- This is all my fault. 

331 
00:31:26,258 --> 00:31:29,638 
Rick, it was an armed robbery, 
there was nothing you could do. 

332 
00:31:29,673 --> 00:31:31,792 
I had that guy can stop 
before he shot my uncle. 

333 
00:31:31,892 --> 00:31:33,504 
Rick Riker? 
-- Yes. 

334 
00:31:33,604 --> 00:31:35,808 
Dr. Whitby. 
What brought you here today? 

335 
00:31:35,843 --> 00:31:38,012 
My uncle. 
-- Bracht your uncle to you here? 

336 
00:31:38,113 --> 00:31:41,458 
No, he was seriously injured. 
-- Then he would not run. 

337 
00:31:41,493 --> 00:31:44,415 
Now, if you want to excuse me now, 
I have to do a breast examination. 

338 
00:31:44,451 --> 00:31:46,843 
Doctor, please. 
Will my uncle survival? 

339 
00:31:46,878 --> 00:31:49,241 
Well, I'm not beroepswedder, but 
if you want to put some money ... 

340 
00:31:49,341 --> 00:31:51,036 
then I give him another week. 

341 
00:31:51,136 --> 00:31:52,455 
Oh, my God. 
-- It is okay, 

342 
00:31:52,555 --> 00:31:56,480 
This is a normal emotional reaction. 
But this should soften. 

343 
00:31:56,515 --> 00:32:00,952 
Voila, easy. 
-- That's your vein. 

344 
00:32:00,987 --> 00:32:05,119 
That I know ... 
-- First my parents and now this. 

345 
00:32:05,996 --> 00:32:07,565 
What am I still a kluns. 

346 
00:32:07,666 --> 00:32:10,338 
Yes, there's your life or 
proof of. 

347 
00:32:10,373 --> 00:32:12,974 
But your uncle believed in you, and me too. 

348 
00:32:13,009 --> 00:32:17,433 
It is never too late to humans 
be that you had to be. 

349 
00:32:22,527 --> 00:32:25,073 
Rick. 

350 
00:32:31,458 --> 00:32:32,444 
Hello Rick. 

351 
00:32:32,545 --> 00:32:35,070 
Who are you and how you know my name? 

352 
00:32:35,104 --> 00:32:37,559 
I am a helderziende. 
-- Proof it. 

353 
00:32:37,594 --> 00:32:43,731 
Think of a number between one and 
one million and I say what it is. 

354 
00:32:43,766 --> 00:32:47,280 
Nine. 
-- Not out loud, stommerik. 

355 
00:32:47,315 --> 00:32:49,281 
Follow me. 

356 
00:32:51,328 --> 00:32:55,260 
My name is Professor Xavier 
and this is my school. 

357 
00:32:55,294 --> 00:33:00,261 
I began to accept people with special 
talents, like yours, to help. 

358 
00:33:00,297 --> 00:33:03,684 
Our students learn here 
their incredible talents to refine ... 

359 
00:33:03,719 --> 00:33:07,524 
taking the general interest 
driven approach. 

360 
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:14,586 
We have children here 
who can walk through walls. 

361 
00:33:14,622 --> 00:33:18,169 
We have children who think 
that they can walk through walls. 

362 
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:20,632 
Some faces are perhaps known for, 

363 
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:23,058 
as Wolverine. 

364 
00:33:23,094 --> 00:33:25,849 
Other mutants 
you had probably never heard 

365 
00:33:25,884 --> 00:33:28,151 
as Sneezo. 

366 
00:33:28,186 --> 00:33:31,318 
Most of our students 
were born with their forces, 

367 
00:33:31,353 --> 00:33:34,449 
while others, like you, 
later they acquired in their lives. 

368 
00:33:34,483 --> 00:33:36,751 
Is that ... 
-- Yes, he's it. 

369 
00:33:36,786 --> 00:33:40,459 
When he came to this school 
he weighed 65 kilos. 

370 
00:33:40,494 --> 00:33:44,132 
By taking steroids, you can achieve a great deal. 

371 
00:33:44,167 --> 00:33:47,347 
You should not touch those pills, Barry. 

372 
00:33:52,106 --> 00:33:56,363 
Why have you brought me here? 
-- Because you've Instance to be the best. 

373 
00:33:56,398 --> 00:33:57,640 
But I can not even fly. 

374 
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:01,665 
Once you the true meaning of heroïsme knows, 
you can fly. 

375 
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:05,589 
But first I must learn your secret 
of the superhero. 

376 
00:34:05,624 --> 00:34:09,304 
He Storm, it seems 
or what you're added. 

377 
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:15,607 
So, Professor, what that secret is concerned ... 
-- Well, you see ... 

378 
00:34:15,642 --> 00:34:18,577 
Xavier. 
-- Verdikke. 

379 
00:34:18,613 --> 00:34:22,243 
Well, can you explain to me 
her blouse why I believe in your cabinet? 

380 
00:34:22,278 --> 00:34:26,083 
But baby, I see nobody. 
-- O no? 

381 
00:34:27,002 --> 00:34:29,972 
Invisible Girl? 
-- Apparently not invisible enough. 

382 
00:34:30,007 --> 00:34:32,495 
Had you taken care of your husband 
then perhaps this was not done. 

383 
00:34:32,596 --> 00:34:34,940 
No, they did not. 
-- This is crazy slut. 

384 
00:34:34,975 --> 00:34:38,899 
I ga you have to beatings, 
you can not just say ... 

385 
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:48,958 
And now what? What should you say, 
invisible slut. 

386 
00:34:48,993 --> 00:34:51,753 
Can I no longer care, 
I'm here. 

387 
00:34:51,787 --> 00:34:54,511 
How could you show me this condition? 
And your children? 

388 
00:34:54,546 --> 00:34:56,729 
And your newborn baby? 

389 
00:34:56,764 --> 00:34:58,710 
How can I be sure they baby from me? 

390 
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:01,314 
Because he can. 

391 
00:35:04,861 --> 00:35:09,579 
Ga Now I never know the secret 
of the superhero. 

392 
00:35:09,614 --> 00:35:13,086 
Do you know the secret? 
Come closer. 

393 
00:35:15,339 --> 00:35:17,851 
Make a costume, Simpleton. 

394 
00:35:17,886 --> 00:35:22,018 
I swear, they are every year 
stupid and stupid. 

395 
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:24,733 
A costume. 

396 
00:35:57,165 --> 00:35:59,713 
Rick, have you ... 

397 
00:35:59,747 --> 00:36:01,841 
My God. 

398 
00:36:05,097 --> 00:36:07,983 
You're just a real superhero, man. 

399 
00:36:08,018 --> 00:36:11,233 
That is enough mask. 
How breath you really? 

400 
00:36:13,236 --> 00:36:15,056 
What's that sound? 

401 
00:36:15,157 --> 00:36:18,538 
With a kind of air into the mask. 

402 
00:36:18,573 --> 00:36:20,066 
Dude, you're smart. 

403

404 
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:26,385 
I ga you have something to say Rick, this is good. 
I am impressed. 

405 
00:36:26,421 --> 00:36:28,848 
Genuine be impressed. 

406 
00:36:39,325 --> 00:36:42,622 
Hey, that's my spot. 
You sit on my gargoyles. 

407 
00:36:42,657 --> 00:36:44,233

-- I look deeply about the city. 

409 
00:36:47,751 --> 00:36:50,137 
Well, I do so here. 
So if you do not go away, 

410 
00:36:50,172 --> 00:36:52,139 
I think we will have to share. 

411

-- Dragonfly.

So, what is your superpower. 
-- What is my superpower?

00:40:04,907 --> 00:40:07,507 
Have you perhaps a vacancy for ... 
-- A vacancy? 

463 
00:40:07,542 --> 00:40:10,108 
How dare you come in here 
and ask me to a job? 

464 
00:40:10,209 --> 00:40:11,653 
I am the chief editor. 

465 
00:40:11,752 --> 00:40:15,510 
I know the mayor of Venus. 
Hamburgers can predict the future. 

466 
00:40:15,544 --> 00:40:16,787 
Rosie O'Donnell ... 
-- We apologize, 

467 
00:40:16,887 --> 00:40:19,374 
we must share the building 
with a psychiatric clinic. 

468 
00:40:19,474 --> 00:40:21,921 
Bad news boss, we are nowhere 
with photos of Dragonfly. 

469 
00:40:22,021 --> 00:40:24,693 
Damn, we need it 
for the cup tomorrow. 

470 
00:40:24,728 --> 00:40:27,239 
What do you think? 

471 
00:40:29,493 --> 00:40:34,126 
It seems almost as if you're Dragonfly. 

472 
00:40:34,161 --> 00:40:36,881 
No, no, look. 

473 
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,578 
That is only photography. 

474 
00:40:39,677 --> 00:40:43,435 
I just heard on the scanner that the police 
on its way to the Empire University. 

475 
00:40:43,471 --> 00:40:46,900 
We will photos need. 
Jochie, I want you ... 

476 
00:40:46,935 --> 00:40:48,901 
Where he is now going? 

477 
00:41:02,887 --> 00:41:06,059 
This is the head of the police. 
The building was surrounded. 

478 
00:41:06,095 --> 00:41:08,855 
Come out with your hands in the air. 

479 
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:13,111 
What on earth is that? 

480 
00:41:26,847 --> 00:41:30,443 
I am trophy. 

481 
00:41:30,479 --> 00:41:33,610 
And your time has expired. 

482 
00:41:49,597 --> 00:41:52,669 
It makes no sense to you to do. 
-- I fight to my last breath. 

483 
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:56,860 
Like the sands of time 
I'm constantly and mercilessly. 

484 
00:41:56,895 --> 00:41:59,163 
The evil never wins, trophy. 

485 
00:41:59,197 --> 00:42:02,203 
You'll pay for your crimes 
and Court will ... 

486 
00:42:02,237 --> 00:42:05,209 
Stop. 

487 
00:42:07,212 --> 00:42:09,883 
Is it? 
-- No. 

488 
00:42:15,894 --> 00:42:19,317 
Knives of titanium, cutting them by diamonds. 

489 
00:42:19,352 --> 00:42:22,532 
I do not wear diamonds. 

490 
00:42:30,045 --> 00:42:35,512 
I would like to remain a bit longer, 
but I do not have the time. 

491 
00:42:42,276 --> 00:42:43,803 
Knives of titanium, it seems ... 

492 
00:42:43,903 --> 00:42:47,417 
that someone has found your weakness. 
-- That is not my weakness. 

493 
00:42:47,452 --> 00:42:50,874 
I'm sorry, I had forgotten, 
your weakness is that you can not fly. 

494 
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:54,340 
Maybe if you had a partner? 
-- I do not need help. 

495 
00:42:57,553 --> 00:43:00,231 
I can reassure my own. 

496 
00:43:00,267 --> 00:43:04,197 
It means a lot to you, huh? 
-- What? 

497 
00:43:04,232 --> 00:43:09,332 
No, she has already somebody. 
-- Perhaps this is a good thing. 

498 
00:43:09,366 --> 00:43:13,708 
It may finally best dangerous 
to the girlfriend of a Dragonfly. 

499 
00:43:13,743 --> 00:43:16,697 
I do not know what I should do, Aunt Lucille, 
I'm in love with her. 

500 
00:43:16,797 --> 00:43:19,726 
So be it. 
But you remember that for you to tackle ...

They are beautiful. 
You're so encouraging.

something that I should not know? 

511 
00:44:08,885 --> 00:44:12,064 
Something that is hidden deep within you? 

512 
00:44:13,273 --> 00:44:15,694 
Well, there is ... 

513 
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:19,495 
Keep your identity hidden, Rick.

Nothing?

Of course, Lucille, you need support

I wish I knew about love. 
-- That will come baby, 

538 
00:48:11,533 --> 00:48:14,719 
you should just follow your heart. 

539

Let but, you think I'm crazy.

I hope that this is not a burden.

Rick Riker that your neighbour.

Where's Rick?

That is odd, I thought he was away. 
I will call him.

That you have not told me.

I am a bit 
the unofficial photographer of Dragonfly.

What happened to your arm? 

570 
00:52:24,916 --> 00:52:28,888 
A fietsboodschapper drove me overthrow. 

571 
00:52:28,923 --> 00:52:34,475 
I see that your wrist is linked. 
-- Yes, I have burned to hot coffee. 

572 
00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:38,692 
And you have a cut in your lip. 

573

My crackpijp broke. 

574 
00:52:42,574 --> 00:52:49,001

-- Yes, I met a girl on Craigslist. 

575 
00:52:49,961 --> 00:52:56,557 
And you have a bruising in your neck. 
-- I met a boy on Craigslist. 

576 
00:52:59,521 --> 00:53:02,944 
I'm sorry Lance, we should go. 
-- Why then? 

577 
00:53:02,979 --> 00:53:06,324 
I've done in my pants. 

578 
00:53:08,246 --> 00:53:10,708 
I do row.

Yes, I think so, 
you can say that we are thick.

Has he ever asked me to? 

585 
00:53:44,728 --> 00:53:49,027 
Yes, once. 
-- What did you do? 

586 
00:53:49,737 --> 00:53:53,660 
Well, I said ... I told him ... 

587 
00:53:53,695 --> 00:53:57,549 
I told him about Jill that ... 

588 
00:53:57,584 --> 00:54:01,968 
when you look in her eyes 
and they look back in your eyes, that ... 

589 
00:54:04,472 --> 00:54:09,523 
that you know that you would do everything 
to a better man to be so ... 

590 
00:54:12,110 --> 00:54:15,679 
if you ever had the good fortune 
to her ... 

591 
00:54:15,714 --> 00:54:19,249 
every second you could earn 
its perfect ... 

592 
00:54:24,883 --> 00:54:28,932 
its infinite charm and beauty ... 

593 
00:54:32,690 --> 00:54:36,405 
and her endless love. 

594 
00:54:37,198 --> 00:54:41,330 
Do not cry. 
-- Do I not, my eyes burn. 

595 
00:54:43,334 --> 00:54:48,678 
I want you know that that was the most beautiful 
that anyone ever said to me. 

596 
00:54:53,686 --> 00:54:57,610 
Will I do burn a candle? 
-- Thank you. 

597 
00:54:58,236 --> 00:55:01,534 
I'm so confused, and yet ... 

598 
00:55:03,036 --> 00:55:06,168 
I know exactly what I want. 

599 
00:55:24,576 --> 00:55:27,546 
I'm sorry if ongenodigd binnenval. 

600 
00:55:27,581 --> 00:55:30,962 
It is okay, we all hoped 
that someone would open a window. 

601 
00:55:30,997 --> 00:55:32,657 
It was here rather stale. 

602 
00:55:32,757 --> 00:55:37,265 
So, this is the hollow of Dragonfly. 

603 
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:39,525 
How did you know ... 
-- No, no, 

604 
00:55:39,561 --> 00:55:44,570 
I'm not here to fight with you, 
there are thousands of others who I want dead. 

605 
00:55:44,604 --> 00:55:50,831 
With this visit I would like to show 
who will be hurt if you frustrates me. 

606 
00:55:50,867 --> 00:55:53,252 
Never. 

607 
00:56:04,022 --> 00:56:07,361 
Time to go. 

608 
00:56:12,496 --> 00:56:16,503 
The woman, Lucille Adams 
East Empire City, was seriously injured. 

609 
00:56:16,538 --> 00:56:18,555 
How was she injured? 
-- Heavy. 

610 
00:56:18,590 --> 00:56:21,512 
And Dragonfly? 
-- Well, I can tell you ... 

611 
00:56:21,546 --> 00:56:24,316 
nobody's life that he has rescued. 

612 
00:56:24,351 --> 00:56:28,867 
Doctor, how it is with her? 
-- It is becoming worse with her. 

613 
00:56:28,901 --> 00:56:32,407 
They can not talk, not walk, 
she has no control over her bowels. 

614 
00:56:32,442 --> 00:56:34,060 
This is terrible. 
-- I know, 

615 
00:56:34,161 --> 00:56:38,918 
I've already created a MySpace page 
with the name 'Crazy Shit Machine. " 

616 
00:56:38,954 --> 00:56:40,888 
She already has 40 friends. 

617 
00:56:40,922 --> 00:56:45,263 
Wait again, that is another his file, 
your aunt has no problems with her intestines, 

618 
00:56:45,299 --> 00:56:47,316 
Happy. 
-- Because she is dead. 

619 
00:56:47,351 --> 00:56:50,523 
Excuse me really Rick, 
but there is something good. 

620 
00:56:50,558 --> 00:56:53,661 
Your uncle woke up this morning from his coma. 
-- Yes? 

621 
00:56:53,696 --> 00:56:58,413 
But you can not have him tell your aunt, 
he is in a fragile mental state. 

622 
00:56:58,448 --> 00:57:02,295 
Due to bad news 
he may go back into a coma. 

623 
00:57:02,329 --> 00:57:05,008 
I understand it. 

624 
00:57:06,386 --> 00:57:10,524 
Mr. Adams, you've visited. 
-- Is the Lucille? 

625 
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:14,024 
No sir, it's not your dead wife, 
it's your cousin, Rick. 

626 
00:57:14,059 --> 00:57:15,886 
Remember, no bad news. 

627 
00:57:15,986 --> 00:57:20,710 
Voila sir, here's my bill. 
-- Did you give me surgery? 

628 
00:57:20,745 --> 00:57:24,585 
Yes, we confused you with a patient 
who went on sex change, 

629 
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:26,781 
but do not worry, 
we have not deleted your penis. 

630 
00:57:26,881 --> 00:57:29,869 
We have your testicles removed 
but since your wife is dead ... 

631 
00:57:29,969 --> 00:57:33,209 
you'll still no longer need. 
Try what his energy to raise ... 

632 
00:57:33,309 --> 00:57:36,273 
then he quickly the old one. 

633 
00:57:37,609 --> 00:57:41,449 
We are here together today 
to say goodbye to Lucille Adams. 

634 
00:57:41,484 --> 00:57:45,546 
Goodbye. 
-- And now the treurdicht. 

635 
00:57:45,581 --> 00:57:48,544 
It is sad to remember 
that this is the last time ... 

636 
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:52,894 
I looked at the face 
my wife can watch. 

637 
00:57:52,928 --> 00:57:58,188 
How could you afpakken her from me. 
I can not live without her. 

638 
00:58:00,942 --> 00:58:05,242 
Sorry, there was a terrible mistake. 
This is your wife, 

639 
00:58:05,277 --> 00:58:08,706 
she is the wife of this man. 

640 
00:58:10,377 --> 00:58:13,131 
Give me five minutes. 

641 
00:58:23,066 --> 00:58:25,947 
You're a lucky man. 

642 
00:58:25,981 --> 00:58:28,952 
Where is Lucille? 

643 
00:58:36,590 --> 00:58:40,599 
I have a coupon for a cremation. 

644 
00:58:47,110 --> 00:58:50,699 
I'm so sorry for your loss. 

645 
00:58:51,826 --> 00:58:54,004 
What is happening? 

646 
00:58:54,039 --> 00:58:59,591 
I know I said things 
but I realize now more than ever ... 

647 
00:58:59,626 --> 00:59:04,182 
that we may never together. 
-- I believe you do not. 

648 
00:59:05,768 --> 00:59:10,485 
You love me Rick, I know. 
-- Jill, believe me, 

649 
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:14,284 
I tell you this for your own good, I ... 

650 
00:59:16,705 --> 00:59:20,259 
I do not like you. 

651 
00:59:20,294 --> 00:59:23,885 
You are no longer in my top five. 

652 
00:59:23,919 --> 00:59:26,890 
How could you? 

653 
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:27,960 
'Causes more than likely depression' 

654 
01:00:41,233 --> 01:00:44,948 
My God, you should look. 
-- What are you doing, man. 

655 
01:00:44,983 --> 01:00:48,956 
You have to herpakken. 
-- It makes no sense 

656 
01:00:54,507 --> 01:00:59,899 
Look at yourself, 
you eat junk, you wear a nepbaard, 

657 
01:00:59,934 --> 01:01:05,527 
and we felt your costume in the garbage. 
-- Well, I'm no longer Dragonfly. 

658 
01:01:05,562 --> 01:01:08,497 
But you said that Hourglass 
Thousands of people went dead. 

659 
01:01:08,533 --> 01:01:11,789 
I've already told you, I am no hero. 
Aunt Lucille is dead, 

660 
01:01:11,824 --> 01:01:14,461 
I am the only girl 
that I ever loved rejected ... 

661 
01:01:14,495 --> 01:01:17,681 
and I can not even fly. 

662 
01:01:17,717 --> 01:01:20,857 
That klotelibel had never bite me. 

663 
01:01:20,958 --> 01:01:24,444 
Then you had your father never allowed. 

664 
01:01:24,478 --> 01:01:28,409 
Look at the words that your ancestors 
that ring graveerden. 

665 
01:01:28,444 --> 01:01:33,557 
Honor, courage, sacrifice, 
beauty, commitment, courage, justice, 

666 
01:01:33,592 --> 01:01:38,636 
unity, brotherhood, pride, 
low prices, affordable housing, 

667 
01:01:38,671 --> 01:01:44,313 
easy trousers, internetporno advantageous. 
The remainder is in Latin. 

668 
01:01:44,348 --> 01:01:49,857 
Rick, a hero of the road is dangerous, 
maybe you'll fail or you will fly, 

669 
01:01:49,893 --> 01:01:55,368 
it is important that you use your intellect 
and others from the emergency help. 

670 
01:01:55,403 --> 01:01:59,257 
If you are a real hero. 

671 
01:01:59,292 --> 01:02:04,363 
Perhaps you are right, but 
even though I would like to stop Hourglass, 

672 
01:02:04,399 --> 01:02:09,435 
I do not know where to begin. 
Where does he find a thousand people together? 

673 
01:02:09,470 --> 01:02:10,879 
Look. 

674 
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:16,739 
... live from the Empire City Convention Centre, 
where thousands of people together, 

675 
01:02:16,775 --> 01:02:22,500 
but none of them is more important 
then the winners for the World Humanity Awards. 

676 
01:02:22,535 --> 01:02:24,880 
I do row. 

677 
01:02:26,591 --> 01:02:30,806 
Those shorter road through the park 
has spared us some time. 

678 
01:02:30,841 --> 01:02:34,397 
You go now, 
I'm looking for a parking lot. 

679 
01:02:39,490 --> 01:02:45,793 
Each year, the World Humanity Awards place 
for the largest philanthropic performance honor. 

680 
01:02:45,828 --> 01:02:51,470 
This gala will be the most prestigious world leaders 
Empire City to attract. 

681 
01:02:54,810 --> 01:02:58,565 
Look, there you have Prince Charles 
and Nelson Mandela. Nelson. 

682 
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:01,994 
I was also in prison, man. 

683 
01:03:02,030 --> 01:03:06,330 
One of the guests here Hourglass, 
but what is it? 

684 
01:03:08,042 --> 01:03:10,679 
Thanks for us to invite, Mr. Landers. 

685 
01:03:10,714 --> 01:03:15,221 
Well, if you will be honoured by the world 
do you want your family with you. 

686 
01:03:15,255 --> 01:03:19,270 
One day you might also be part 
of our family? 

687 
01:03:20,439 --> 01:03:25,615 
Ladies and gentlemen, our first prize 
goes to the medical breakthrough of the year. 

688 
01:03:25,650 --> 01:03:30,790 
For the pioneering work of his company 
in the field of feminine hygiene ... 

689 
01:03:30,826 --> 01:03:34,798 
The price to Lou Landers, 
Lavement of the year. 

690 
01:03:36,091 --> 01:03:38,352 
Lavement 

691 
01:03:38,387 --> 01:03:40,842 
He is the Lavement of the year 

692 
01:03:40,877 --> 01:03:43,297 
Is it not amazing, friends? 

693 
01:03:43,398 --> 01:03:44,801 
Is not he wonderful? 

694 
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:49,825 
The Lavement of the year 

695 
01:03:53,247 --> 01:03:55,383 
Lavement 

696 
01:03:55,419 --> 01:03:58,528 
He is Mr. Lavement of the year 

697 
01:03:58,563 --> 01:04:01,604 
See him laugh, see him shine 

698 
01:04:01,639 --> 01:04:06,105 
He is the Lavement, 
the Lavement of the year 

699 
01:04:06,140 --> 01:04:09,318 
Mr. Landers ... 
-- Keep the Lavement up. 

700 
01:04:11,572 --> 01:04:15,421 
Halt, Landers. 
-- Mr. Riker, 

701 
01:04:15,455 --> 01:04:20,130 
So, you know. 
-- Be sure there. 

702 
01:04:21,425 --> 01:04:26,851 
Someone in this auditorium is the Hourglass, 
I need your help to find out whom. 

703 
01:04:26,886 --> 01:04:32,611 
It may be about equal, a guest of honour, 
or maybe even a toneelknecht. 

704 
01:04:38,914 --> 01:04:45,301 
Perhaps it is nothing, I have seen a man 
with something that looked like a barrel Cerillium. 

705 
01:04:46,261 --> 01:04:49,267 
Who? 
-- It there. 

706 
01:04:52,814 --> 01:04:56,405 
His holiness, the Dalai Lama. 

707 
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:04,962 
This man is not who you think, 
he is the trophy. 

708 
01:05:04,997 --> 01:05:08,141 
No, I am a man of peace. 
-- Keep your mouth. 

709 
01:05:08,176 --> 01:05:10,729 
You did all these people murder 
and I can prove otherwise. 

710 
01:05:10,764 --> 01:05:14,187 
Let the world see the weapon that you 
under this garment hides. 

711 
01:05:15,648 --> 01:05:19,656 
I love you not for the crazy, Hourglass, 
you hide below five kilos Cerillium. 

712 
01:05:19,691 --> 01:05:21,658 
What? 

713 
01:05:24,122 --> 01:05:26,501 
Pak him. 

714 
01:05:37,896 --> 01:05:40,568 
Peace, kal ... 

715 
01:05:54,928 --> 01:05:58,225 
You? You're the trophy. 

716 
01:06:09,496 --> 01:06:12,251 
Hourglass. 

717 
01:06:18,470 --> 01:06:21,691 
Heldconventie? 
-- It is a convention for people ... 

718 
01:06:21,725 --> 01:06:24,089 
who like verkleden 
in their favorite hero or crook ... 

719 
01:06:24,188 --> 01:06:27,946 
and indeed, your costume is worthless. 
-- From the road. 

720 
01:06:34,415 --> 01:06:40,552 
Hourglass, I let you never committed. 
-- Forget it, Dragonfly, you come too late. 

721 
01:06:41,887 --> 01:06:44,309 
Wegwezen. 

722 
01:07:00,046 --> 01:07:03,100 
Goodbye, 

723 
01:07:03,135 --> 01:07:05,514 
vliegje small. 

724 
01:07:07,267 --> 01:07:10,857 
Dragonfly. 
-- No. 

725 
01:07:40,369 --> 01:07:45,044 
Dragonfly, you must stop Hourglass. 

726 
01:07:45,921 --> 01:07:49,977 
I can not, I can not fly. 

727 
01:07:50,012 --> 01:07:55,856 
If my life can learn a lesson, it is 
that the spirit is stronger than the body, 

728 
01:07:55,891 --> 01:07:58,742 
the hero is inside. 

729 
01:07:58,777 --> 01:08:01,782 
This is a text of Celine Dion. 

730 
01:08:01,818 --> 01:08:04,787 
Never mind, it's the truth. 

731 
01:08:04,823 --> 01:08:07,335 
You're right. 

732 
01:08:13,178 --> 01:08:15,765 
It works. 

733 
01:08:17,477 --> 01:08:19,445 
Sorry. 

734 
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:23,948 
Look, Dragonfly, while your city dies. 

735 
01:08:35,135 --> 01:08:39,685 
Where am I? 
-- You are with me, 

736 
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:42,398 
your lover. 

737 
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:52,833 
'10 SECONDS TO ONSTERFELIJKHEID ' 
-- No. 

738 
01:08:52,868 --> 01:08:56,132 
'Rosie O'Donnel goes naked' 
-- No. 

739 
01:08:56,166 --> 01:08:59,096 
Understand you now? 

740 
01:09:07,610 --> 01:09:10,573 
Think of off-earner families. 

741 
01:09:10,609 --> 01:09:13,538 
There is no time anymore. 

742 
01:09:24,348 --> 01:09:26,729 
It is over. 

743 
01:09:31,863 --> 01:09:34,576 
I have you. 

744 
01:09:36,203 --> 01:09:39,543 
Did you think I would have done something 
with the girl I love? 

745 
01:09:39,579 --> 01:09:42,758 
Well, we still fall. 

746 
01:09:43,468 --> 01:09:47,041 
If I could do but fly. 
Maybe I had absolutely no hero ... 

747 
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:51,106 
and I had a normal job, 
an accountant, a turnleraar. 

748 
01:09:51,141 --> 01:09:54,118 
This is a tall building. 

749 
01:09:54,153 --> 01:09:58,954 
It may take me no longer care, 
if I die is that fortunately, in your arms. 

750 
01:09:58,988 --> 01:10:02,502 
You're my hero, Rick Riker, 
and I love you. 

751 
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:12,895 
Fortunately, there remained only 50 floors. 
Shut up. 

752 
01:10:24,542 --> 01:10:29,759 
Thank you, Dragonfly, by you 
our city is finally secure. 

753 
01:10:29,794 --> 01:10:32,521 
That sound you've said, Dr. Hawking. 

754 
01:10:32,556 --> 01:10:38,151 
At the end of good, all right. 
Let us what not to eat, I treat. 

755 
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:42,915 
Who am I? I'm Rick Riker. 
I'm Dragonfly, 

756 
01:10:42,950 --> 01:10:49,170 
and as long as there is injustice and crime, 
I will always be a superhero ... 

757 
01:10:49,358 --> 01:10:52,283
