1
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,138
 Reggie ! Reggie ! Reggie !

2
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:57,808
 Reggie Jackson
having an incredible night.

3
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:01,687
Two for two, with a walk,
four runs batted in.

4
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,065
- And he's already hit
two home runs tonight.
- Reggie ! Reggie !

5
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:08,443
- And just listen to that crowd.
- Reggie ! Reggie !

6
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:10,570
Reggie !
Reggie ! Reggie !

7
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:14,783
Come on, Reggie ! Hit another one !
Hit another home run !

8
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:16,910
Coop, he's
already hit two.

9
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:21,164
 It's a fly ball
to right, and deep !

10
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:24,167
That's going to be
way back !

11
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:27,337
- And that's going to be gone !
- Yea !

12
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:33,176
- Reggie Jackson hits
his third home run of the game !
- Yes ! Whoo !

13
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,470
All right !

14
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,481
- Good catch, Coop.
- I can't believe it.

15
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:49,526
I totally had it,
but my glasses slipped.

16
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:53,238
Remer, someday I'm gonna become
a big sports star, too.

17
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:55,240
Whatever you say,
Coop.

18
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:59,369
You just watch me, dude.
You just watch me.

19
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:02,372
 There was a time in America...

20
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:04,541
when contests
of athletic prowess...

21
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:07,419
were a metaphor
for the nobility of man.

22
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:10,881
Historic moments, forged
by the love of the game,

23
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:15,010
celebrated the human potential
to achieve excellence.

24
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:18,930
But as time passed and
the country neared the millennium,

25
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:20,974
something went awry.

26
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:24,186
 Manning rolls right.
He's got Plough at the ten.

27
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:28,357
The five--
Touchdown, Dallas !

28
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,067
 The ideal of sportsmanship...

29
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,029
began to take a back seat
to excessive celebration.

30
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:45,540
The athletes caring less
about executing the play...

31
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:48,001
than planning
the vulgar grandstanding...

32
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:53,340
that inevitably followed even
the most pedestrian of accomplishments.

33
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:56,551
The games themselves
became subordinate...

34
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:59,221
to the quest for money.

35
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:02,265
Stadiums and arenas...

36
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,559
became nothing more
than giant billboards...

37
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:07,104
to promote
commercial products.

38
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,900
- Players sold their services
to the highest bidder,
-

39
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:14,569
much like the hired guns
of the Old West.

40
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:17,823
Thank you. And after playing
for New England,

41
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:22,577
San Diego, Houston, St. Louis,
a year for the Toronto Argonauts,

42
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:25,414
plus one season as a greeter
at the Desert lnn,

43
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:29,459
- I'm happy to finally play here
in the fine city of Miami.
-

44
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:32,587
-Minnesota.

45
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,048
- Whatever. Shit.
-

46
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:38,468
Soon it was commonplace
for entire teams to change cities...

47
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,470
in search
of greater profits.

48
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:43,849
The Minneapolis Lakers moved to
Los Angeles where there are no lakes.

49
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:46,852
The Oilers moved to Tennessee
where there is no oil.

50
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:50,021
The Jazz moved to Salt Lake City
where they don't allow music.

51
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:53,942
The Oakland Raiders moved to L.A.
and then back to Oakland.

52
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,486
No one in Los Angeles
seemed to notice.

53
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:59,906
The search for greener pastures
went on unabated.

54
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,242
Continued expansion
diluted the talent pool,

55
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:04,995
forcing owners
to recruit heavily...

56
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,789
- from prisons,
mental institutions and Texas.
-

57
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:11,251
Fistfighting and brawling
permeated every sport,

58
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,420
overshadowing
any athletic competition.

59
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,172
Oh !

60
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,215
As the problems mounted,

61
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:20,886
the fans became
less and less interested.

62
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:24,931
To reverse the trend, major sports
started interleague play.

63
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:28,351
When that novelty wore off,
they tried intersports play.

64
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,520


65
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:34,024
But no matter
how far major sports went,

66
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:36,860
it wasn't enough
to bring the fans back.

67
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:40,155
The spirit of athletic
competition, however,

68
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:42,157
indeed was not dead.

69
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:46,828
Its seed merely lay dormant
in the dreams of the young.

70
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:51,124
 You know, Remer, someday
I'm gonna be a big sports star.

71
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:59,674
You know, Remer, someday
I'm gonna own a big sports bar.

72
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:01,885
Hurry it up, Coop.

73
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,429
Hold on. I just
gotta water the plants.

74
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:07,140


75
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:10,435
I don't wanna go to a party with
a bunch of losers from high school.

76
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:13,730
But this is Britney Kiser's house,
and I really want to fuck her.

77
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,317
- Dr. Kiser.
- Dr. Kiser.

78
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,069
Coop and Remer.

79
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,697
We graduated
with Britney.

80
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:27,577
- You graduated ?
- Of course we graduated, cock-- Beer ?

81
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:30,413


82
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:33,625
Man, this place looks like
a Dockers commercial.

83
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:37,379
- Oh, hey, Stef !
- Coop ! Remer !

84
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,923
- You want a beer ?
- Oh, my God !

85
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:43,552
You guys haven't changed
since high school.

86
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:46,221
- Oh, cool.
- No, it isn't.

87
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,725
Cock.

88
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:54,271
- Hey, Skid Mark Steve ! Oh, cool.
- Hey, dude !

89
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,773
You still just hanging out
playing Nintendo ?

90
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,359
Well, if you must know, I'm in
my second year of med school...

91
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,278
and I'm training
for the Summer Games.

92
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:05,240
- What are you two up two ?
- Just hanging out.

93
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:07,576
Playing Nintendo.
Cock.

94
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:10,412
- Hmm.
-  You looking forward
to getting out of here ?

95
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:13,623
-Yeah, I'm all packed. It should be fun.
-Hi, Britney.

96
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,377
Coop ! Remer !

97
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,379
I didn't think
you guys would show up.

98
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,381
Well, we wouldn't
miss your party.

99
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:24,301
No, I mean, I don't remember
putting you on the guest list.

100
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,804
Huh. Well, Ted
told us about it.

101
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,265
Excuse me.

102
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:33,351
Ted, why would you tell
those losers about my party ?

103
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:36,062
-  l-l-l-l--
- This party sucks. Let's bail.

104
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:38,440
No, dude. Let's go up
to Britney's room.

105
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:41,234
-Remer !

106
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,236
Come in here.

107
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,448
Check it out.

108
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,492
Britney's underwear, dude.

109
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,494
Aw, dude.

110
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,498
Dude ! Dude ! Dude !

111
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:58,793
-I am so jealous of you.

112
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,795
Oh, God !

113
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,340


114
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,592
- Excuse me.
- Britney.

115
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:08,970
What are you guys doing
in my mom's room ?

116
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:14,351
Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh !

117
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,479
- Get out of here !
- Uh

118
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:22,150
-Oh, Jesus !
- Ah ! Ah !

119
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:27,572
Dude, we're never gonna get a chick
like Britney Kiser, are we ?

120
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:29,574
Or any other chick.

121
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:31,826
But it's only 'cause
we have no jobs.

122
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,995
Our rent check's
three months overdue,

123
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:36,164
and our gas
is about to get shut off.

124
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:39,542
What do girls
want anyway ?

125
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:43,046
Well, apparently,
not total losers.

126
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:46,466
Well, we're pretty good
at basketball.

127
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:50,637
As long as we don't have to run or
jump or dribble. You know what I mean ?

128
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,140
- That shit's overrated anyway.
-  Hey !

129
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:57,018
- You guys up for a little game ?
- Sure.

130
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,854
Well, let's
make it interesting.

131
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,898
Say 20 bucks ?

132
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,858
How about 50 ?

133
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,778
- You're on.
- Let's go. Here we go.

134
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:09,948
- We don't have 50 bucks.
- We don't have 20.

135
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:12,992
Look, it doesn't matter.
How good can they be ?

136
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:15,745
To the lane, baby !
That's pretty !

137
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,749
- Oh !
- Oh, shit !

138
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,502
Alley-oop !
Alley-oop ! Yeah !

139
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:25,380
Come on, ladies.
We playing or not ?

140
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:30,301
Yeah, but not that pussy ass
two-on-two you guys play in the suburbs.

141
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,721
What, you guys
got something better ?

142
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:37,183
Yeah, but it's this new game
we-we picked up in the hood.

143
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:40,478
- So, what is it ?
- Okay. Okay.

144
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:43,189
I shoot from wherever
I want, right ?

145
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:46,693
And then you have to make that
same shot or else you get a letter.

146
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,862
You mean like horse ?

147
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:51,865
- No, it's not like horse ! -

148
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:54,367


149
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:56,828
Duh. It's, uh

150
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,997
It's baseball rules.

151
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,499
Yeah.

152
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,460
A single's
from the free throw line.

153
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,795
Right. And a double's
from the top of the key.

154
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,131
You can't shoot
from the same place twice.

155
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:11,968
A triple's from back here, and
a home run's from behind the meatballs.

156
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,220
- You miss, you get an out. Ready ?
- Break !

157
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:17,098
- What ?
- We can explain it more slowly.

158
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,184
You're not
big sports guys ?

159
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:24,230
- No, no.
- No, no, no. We get it. We get it, man.

160
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:27,233
Losers up first.

161
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:30,528
So, let me get this straight.
This is a single, right ?

162
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:33,072
Yeah, and a home run's
behind the meatballs.

163
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,949
Take your shot, guy.

164
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:40,246
- You can't spit beer at me
when I'm shooting.
- That's one out.

165
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:43,291
That's the way we play.
I can do whatever I want
to make you miss your shot.

166
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:46,377
- He's right. That's one out.
- One out ?

167
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:48,713
Give me the damn ball !

168
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:54,344
- I fucked your sister.
- Huh ?

169
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,599
- Coop lines up for a double.
- Okay, guys, second and third.

170
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:03,269
Coop's got a runner on third.
This could bring him home.

171
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:06,523
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo,
hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.

172
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,442
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.
Hoo-hoo

173
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:12,695
- Yes! Two outs !
- God, this is-- Come on !

174
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,115
- Oh !
-Ted Nugent.

175
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:18,117
Oh !

176
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:20,662
Oh ! Tip-in. Double play.
That's three outs.

177
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:23,832
- What ?
- We're up.
- That's a double play.

178
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:27,919
- That's nice. Real nice.
- Bottom of the eighth.
This could almost seal it.

179
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,630
Oh, he made that
look easy.

180
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:36,845
Aah ! Damn it !
Come on, man ! What

181
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,598
Oh, one of Britney's mom's
pubic hairs.

182
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:43,268
-Oh, God !
- Oh !

183
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,645
- Come on, man !
- Dude, we win the game !

184
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:48,356
- Dude, that was a sweet psych-out.
- Dude, here's another one.

185
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:52,318
- Oh, come here.
- What the hell's up with that ?

186
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,071
We win, and they get the chicks.
That sucks, dude.

187
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,240
It's jobs.
We gotta get jobs.

188
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:00,201
Then we get the khakis.
Then we get the chicks.

189
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:04,747
Starting tomorrow,
we gotta stop playing games.

190
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,125
Miss it.
Steve Perry.

191
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,294
Steve Perry.

192
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,796
- Ah !
- Yes ! Three outs. I'm up.

193
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,049
- It's the bottom of the fifth.
- Joseph R. Cooper ?

194
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:17,552
That's a single.
Man on first.

195
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:20,680
- Are you Joe Cooper ?
- Cut the crap, Squeak.
You know who I am.

196
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:23,892
Gentlemen, this form authorizes me
to enter onto your property...

197
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:27,061
and terminate services
forthwith until all delinquent
payments have been generated.

198
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:30,064
- What ?
- Dude, he's here to shut off the gas.

199
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:33,526
Squeak, you work
for the gas company now ?

200
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,321
- Gentlemen--
- Double ! Guy on second and third.

201
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:40,825
Is your canine locked up and/or
safely secured within your domicile ?

202
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:43,578
Uh, yeah. He's at the vet
getting his claws removed.

203
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,872
Then if you'll excuse me.

204
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:48,917
Dude, does it just suck
being you ?

205
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,337
I'll show those guys
what sucks.

206
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,757
 Steve Perry. Steve Perry.
 I shoulda been gone

207
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,176
-Oh, yeah, he misses.

208
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,929
- Aw, damn it.
-  You said
no more Journey psych-outs.

209
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:03,014
 Dude, I'm running out of ideas.

210
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:06,517


211
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:09,896
-That's why we have
this little short shot.

212
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,440
- Short shot. Kind of like a bunt.
- Exactly.

213
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,442
- Oh, yeah.
- It doesn't put any runners on base.

214
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:17,445
- That's a sweet idea.
- You lied to me ! Again !

215
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:20,031
Oh, right. The dog's
vet appointment's tomorrow.

216
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:22,742
We put the cat in today.
Honest mistake, Squeak. Sorry.

217
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:25,286
My name's not Squeak !
All right ? It's Kenny !

218
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,289
All right, you little bitch.
Here. Take a shot.

219
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:32,919
I don't wanna take a shot.
I wanna turn off your gas.

220
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,254
And don't call me bitch.

221
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,590
Okay. Squeak.
Let's just shoot for it.

222
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:40,218
Shoot for it ?
What, are you insane ?

223
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,261
This is my job,
you assholes.

224
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:45,598
Look, all you got to do is make
a single from right here...

225
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:49,102
and you can shut off our gas,
and we'll never call you Squeak again.

226
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:52,480
- Or bitch.
-  Or bitch.

227
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,987
- From right here ?
-  Mm-hmm.

228
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,448
All right.
Check this shit out.

229
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:04,450
- Steve Perry.
- Huh ?

230
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:08,162
- Oh !
-

231
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:10,164
-Tough break, Squeak.

232
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:12,750
- Now you gotta fetch the ball, bitch.
-

233
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:18,256
-All right ! Come on, Squeak !

234
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:22,010
We can win the game
with this one, baby. Bring me home.

235
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:25,596
- Yes ! That's it ! We win the game !
-

236
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,600
Dude, we got five runs
that inning.

237
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:31,769
- This game's pretty badass.
-  Another game ?

238
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:34,147
You're up.
Top of the first.

239
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:36,107
 Yo, Tyler.

240
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:39,819
- I hear your sister's
going out with Squeak.
- What ? Oh !

241
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:43,489
- Another psych-out.
- I'm not going out with his sister.

242
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:45,908
Dude, that's the defense.
You gotta psych 'em out.

243
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,661
We gotta say totally fucked-up shit
to make sure the other guy misses.

244
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:51,497
Oh, right. Okay.
Hey, wait a minute !

245
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:54,000
Why is me going out with his sister
totally fucked up ?

246
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,627
Yo, Pierce. I hear your mom's
going out with Squeak.

247
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:59,172
- Whoa !
- Oh, yes ! Two outs.

248
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:02,300
So, you're gonna own 1/12 of the rent,
1/12 of the water bill,

249
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,761
1/12 of the power bill,
1/12 of the cable bill

250
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,721
- Dude, check it out.
- What's that ?

251
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,806
It's a BASEketball.

252
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,100
Whoa, dude. You made a ball ?
Out of what ?

253
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:19,025
Dude, I can't believe
those ass-wipes fired you...

254
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,235
for not shutting off
our gas for six weeks.

255
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:23,654
It was losing the truck
that pissed them off the most.

256
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:25,990
Well, you can camp out
here for a while.

257
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:28,034
Well, this is
pretty sweet.

258
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:31,204
- Does this couch fold out to a bed ?
- Yeah, a totally great bed.

259
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:34,165
But that's Jenkins' bed.
Your bed's over here.

260
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:37,627
Dude, that is
so fucking weak.

261
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,546
How am I supposed
to get a chick in that ?

262
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:44,550
You couldn't get a chick if you had
a $100 bill hanging out of your zipper.

263
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:47,595
- Yeah, I could.
- No, dude, you're a little bitch.

264
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:50,681
I am not ! I don't even know why
I hang out with you guys.

265
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:54,435
- 'Cause you're a piece of shit.
- I am not a piece of shit.

266
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:56,145
- But you're a little bitch.
- Sure are.
- Goddamn it, man !

267
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,313
- But you're a little bitch.
- Sure are.
- Goddamn it, man !

268
00:14:57,355 --> 00:15:01,943
I swear, you guys rip on me
13 or 14 more times, I'm outta here.

269
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:05,571
Well, whatever. Dude, I gotta
show you the scoreboard I made.

270
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:08,991
Your place is
a shit-hole anyway.

271
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:16,499
Well, at least
I'm on the team.

272
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,210
Yeah, they want me

273
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,838


274
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,090
Joe Bryant, WIGM,

275
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,884
at the scene where
an unusual new driveway game...

276
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:30,012
has captured the imagination
of at least one neighborhood.

277
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:34,016
 An entire league
has sprung up around this quirky

278
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:37,186
 ...round-robins,
starting with 12 teams in June,

279
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:40,690
now down to just two, including,
we're told, the inventors of the game,

280
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,234
childhood friends

281
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:46,362
It's off the rim.
Could be a double play.

282
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:49,407
Maxwell tips.

283
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,659
Newman's try.

284
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,619
No !

285
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:57,790
Shirts have a shot
at the conversion.

286
00:15:57,874 --> 00:16:00,501
Remer !

287
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,380
Keeps it alive.

288
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:06,382
Last chance.

289
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:08,843
Coop. Up !

290
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:12,096
- Good ! They make the conversion !
-

291
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:17,226
- And the home run counts !
- Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah !

292
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:22,773
Yeah !

293
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:25,109
What a game !

294
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,820
The Shirts win
the World Championship of BASEketball !

295
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:29,822
Yeah !

296
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:31,824
Gentlemen.

297
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:34,035
Gentlemen.

298
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:37,163
Gentlemen,
I'm Ted Denslow.

299
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,665
- Ted Denslow, the billionaire ?
- Yes.

300
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:43,127
Anyway, I like your little game here.
How'd you like to go pro ?

301
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:45,463
 BASEketball ?

302
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:48,799
I got three words for you:
National BASEketball League.

303
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:52,845
- We're not interested.
- Now, wait a minute. Hear me out.

304
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:55,848
Now, you kids with your loud music
and your Dan Fogelberg,

305
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:59,435
your Zima, hula hoops,
and Pac-Man video games,

306
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,229
don't you see ?

307
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:03,689
People today have
attention spans...

308
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:06,943
that can only be measured
in nanoseconds.

309
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,487


310
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,490
I hear you.

311
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:15,493
- Just look at these people.
-  Whoa !

312
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:19,705
- Way to go, Coop.
- They feel a certain connection
with you as players.

313
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:23,960
With BASEketball,
we can start fresh,

314
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,504
not allow teams
to change cities...

315
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:29,215
or players
to be traded.

316
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,300
And everybody
will get paid the same,

317
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:35,179
just like when I was a kid,
and players were treated like

318
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:37,181
- Indentured servants ?
- Yes !

319
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:39,392
And the real beauty
of this game...

320
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:42,603
is anyone can play.

321
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:45,564
Any normal joe
can be a sports hero.

322
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:49,026
Haven't you ever wanted
to be a sports hero ?

323
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:53,364
Sure. Once. But that--
That was a long time ago.

324
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,866
Well, if I know anything
about this country,

325
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:59,245
- America will go nuts for BASEketball.
-

326
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:02,540
America will go crazy
for BASEketball.

327
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,501
-Listen to that crowd.

328
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:07,962
- Listen to that crowd.
-  Call an ambulance !

329
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,381
 Ooh, ooh, ooh

330
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:15,261
- Ooh, ooh, ooh 
- I say she never cared

331
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,888
 And that she never will

332
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:19,890
 To do it all again

333
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:22,727
 I guess I'll have
to wait until then

334
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,186
 lf I get drunk

335
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:27,273
 Well, the better
I'll understand my baby

336
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,859
 You won't bother me
no more

337
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:36,574
 And if you're drinkin'
well, you know that you're
my friend, and I'll say

338
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:39,327
 I think I'll
have myself a beer

339
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:42,330


340
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:52,548
 Ninth inning.
The Beers still behind by three runs...

341
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,925
and now down
to their last out.

342
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:58,596
And the pressure on these players
has got to be enormous.

343
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,931
All right, you guys.
We've got one out left.

344
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:03,434
We're not beat yet.
We can still win this thing.

345
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,770
- Can we do it ?
-  Yeah !

346
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,772
Yeah ! Go, Coop !

347
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,441
 What a game
these fans are seeing.

348
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:13,611
That gentleman, of course,
Beers owner Ted Denslow,

349
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,738
the father
of professional BASEketball,

350
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,949
along with his lovely
new wife, Yvette.

351
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:20,951


352
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:26,415
 Now shooting,
number 44, Coop "Airman" Cooper !

353
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:29,752
 Coop ! Coop ! Coop !

354
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:32,755
 Coop is heading
for the triple square.

355
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:36,008
Bob Costas, this has to be one of
the most exciting BASEketball games...

356
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:38,636
in recent memory.

357
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:41,263
Just five years ago,
this game was played only on driveways.

358
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,933
 And it's hard
to believe just five years ago,

359
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:46,268
those girls were only
in grade school.

360
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,270
Coop ! Coop ! Coop !

361
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,272
 So, Coop at the triple line.

362
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,942
Jansen sets up
for the psych-out.

363
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:55,027
- Hey, Coop.
- Be right with you, Dirk.

364
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:01,951
-  It's good !
-  Nothing but net.
Coop triples again.

365
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,537
- He's hit for the cycle
seven times tonight.
- He tricked me.

366
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,831
Yeah !

367
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:10,167


368
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,670
- Go, Coop !
- Yeah !

369
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:16,841
And listen to those foam heads
doing the Beers chug.

370
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:19,969
Chug ! Chug !
Chug ! Chug !

371
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,012
Coop's on third,
with two down.

372
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,014
And that brings up
Squeak Scolari.

373
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:27,184
- I knew it was gonna come down to me.
- Relax, dude.

374
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:29,186
It's not just you.
We're a team.

375
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,313
And it all comes down
to just one man.

376
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,399
- Oh, God !
- Listen to me, dude.

377
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,568
If I could have
one guy out there, it'd be you.

378
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:38,529
Unfortunately, that one man
is Squeak Scolari.

379
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:41,407
- Ah, shit !
- Pretend this is just another game.

380
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,243
The Denslow Cup is, of course,
the biggest game of the season.

381
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,537
- Ah, Christ !
- Will you turn that shit off ?

382
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,539
- I'm so scared.
- Listen to me !

383
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:51,542
You make that shot, or I'm gonna shove
your head so far up your fucking ass...

384
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,003
you'll have to
wear yourself as a hat !

385
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:58,549
And in the dugout, Doug Remer giving his
teammate some last-minute encouragement.

386
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,551


387
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:03,095
Now, go out there
and make that shot !

388
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:08,225
Fuck !

389
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:13,564
 The talented Felon Girls...

390
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:17,526
appearing in their
third Denslow Cup game.

391
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:20,196
 Now shooting, number 23,

392
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:22,740
Squeak
"Little Bitch" Scolari !

393
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,536
 Let's go

394
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:30,873
 So Squeak Scolari walks
out to take the last remaining single.

395
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:33,709
Come on, bitch !
Nice one, bitch !

396
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:37,254
Hey, Squeak.
Miss it. Miss it.

397
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:40,633
- It's good.

398
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:43,093
And the Beers
stay alive in the ninth.

399
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:46,889
Dallas Felons owner,
Baxter Cain,

400
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:49,558
hoping for another
Denslow Cup victory.

401
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:52,102
 Now shooting, number 17,

402
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:55,731
Doug "Sir Swish" Remer !

403
00:21:55,814 --> 00:22:00,110
 Two on, two out.
Remer heads for the double line.

404
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:03,822
Remer, you better make sure
your toe's not over the line.

405
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:07,409
Hey, Jansen, nice psych-out,
dingleberry. Yes !

406
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:10,704
 It's in.
It's now a two-run game.

407
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:13,749
Dirk Jansen apparently missing
another psych-out.

408
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:17,086
And everyone here at Beers Garden
is on their feet.

409
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:19,505
 Coop ! Coop ! Coop !

410
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,549
And, Al,
at a time like this,

411
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:24,093
you can't help thinking
about guys like John Elway,

412
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:27,137
guys who kept coming close
and then finally got there.

413
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:30,724
- Ow !
- If Coop can make this one,

414
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:33,644
- the Beers' long wait will be over.
-

415
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:37,565
Hey, Coop, it looks like your boy
Denslow's about to buy the farm.

416
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:39,775
- Aah !
- Ah !

417
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,819
- Oh !
-  He missed.

418
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:44,196
- Oh !
- He missed. I don't believe it.

419
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,283
- The Felons win their second
consecutive Denslow Cup...
- No, no.

420
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:49,952
- on the strength
of a Dirk Jansen psych-out.
- Aw !

421
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:52,079
-I got you, dude. I got you.

422
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:54,582
- You--
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Relax. Relax.

423
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:56,667
- Do the Happy Dance.
- We just lost the game.

424
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,669
Do the Happy Dance.

425
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:01,005
- Where's the singing ?
- Aw, I don't wanna sing.

426
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:03,299
Do the singing.
Come on. Sing.

427
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,051
 Happy Dance
Doin' the Happy Dance

428
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:08,053


429
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:10,055
Shit ! Denslow !

430
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:13,434
 And these Beers fans
have to be disappointed.

431
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:16,770
What an unfortunate thing
to happen on Dozen Egg Night.

432
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:18,981
Oh ! Oh ! Oh !

433
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:21,275
Oh !

434
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:24,153
It's my husband.
Somebody help him. Oh, God !

435
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:26,697
- If there's anything you need--
- Oh, Teddy.

436
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,824
I can't believe it.
He just fell over.

437
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:32,536
- Oh !
- Mrs. Denslow ? Mrs. Denslow !

438
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,538
-Oh !

439
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,540
I wish there was
something I could do.

440
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:39,585
- Uhh !
- They stopped serving them
after the seventh inning.

441
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:42,880
Somebody get this man
a hot dog !

442
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,674


443
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:49,887
 You're absolutely right, Jim.

444
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,056
Ted Denslow was a hero because
his vision brought BASEketball...

445
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:54,350
from neighborhood driveways
into big arenas,

446
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,977
but more importantly,
into the hearts and TVs of America.

447
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:58,979
- It's a very sad day.
- Yee-ha !

448
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:01,440
His untimely death casts an unbearable
pall over an otherwise sweet victory.

449
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,400
- Hey, yeah !
- And all of our hearts...

450
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,861
- are with you and your family on this--
- Go, Dallas !

451
00:24:05,903 --> 00:24:09,198
Dirk Jansen, winner of the
Winter's Warm Douche M.V.P. trophy.

452
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:12,368
What's your take
on this stunning upset ?

453
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:15,120
The whole key to this game
was when I psyched out Coop.

454
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:17,623
No doubt about it.
And all you people watching-

455
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:20,125
I can't believe this guy.
He didn't psych me out.

456
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:22,753
If anyone should get the psych-out,
it should be Denslow.

457
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:27,466
- Dude, weak.
- Coop, I know this is
a dark time for you,

458
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:30,094
but I'd like to get your thoughts
on what happened today.

459
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:34,598
Well, Tim, today I lost
the big game and a dear friend.

460
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,102
Um, I'm feeling
pretty vulnerable right now.

461
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:41,605
I don't think I should be alone.
I really need people to talk--

462
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:45,275
It certainly does seem to be
raining shit on Joe Cooper right now.

463
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:48,654
On paper, the Beers
had the far superior team.

464
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:52,241
With the outside shooting of Coop
and the deadly accuracy of Doug Remer,

465
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,284
what happened out there ?

466
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,328
Well, you know,
it was a team effort,

467
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:59,331
and I guess it took every player
working together to lose this one.

468
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:01,500
Thanks, Doug. And so

469
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:04,920
- Hey ! You wanna do
an interview with me ?
- No.

470
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:07,756
So another BASEketball championship
is in the books.

471
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:10,926
Yet another opportunity lost
for the Beers.

472
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:13,846
-Man, I gotta go.

473
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,848
Hey, Coop.

474
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:19,643
Coop ! What's going on ?
Coop ! Coop ! Hey, Coop !

475
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:21,812
This is Tim McCarver
from Beers Garden...

476
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:26,442
-where the Dallas Felons have
defeated the Milwaukee Beers...

477
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:31,113
- in Denslow Cup IV
by a score of 13 to 11.
-

478
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:33,866
-  Everybody in.
-

479
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,868
One at a time.

480
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:38,954
-Aw, please. Can we ?

481
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:40,998
There he is !

482
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,292
- Where ?
- Oh, man !
- Cool !

483
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:45,294
- Can we talk to him ?
-

484
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:48,797
- Can we stay ?
- Please, Miss Reed.

485
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:51,842
Excuse me.
Excuse me. Hi.

486
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:54,970
Would you mind signing a couple
of autographs for the kids ?

487
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:57,765
I think you're looking for the
Dallas locker room. It's over there.

488
00:25:57,848 --> 00:26:00,768
I know,
but it was so crowded.

489
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:03,771
I mean, um, they would really
rather have your autograph.

490
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:07,274
- Really ?
- Anyway, would you mind signing these ?

491
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:09,318
Uh, sure.

492
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,153
Oh.

493
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:15,699
Uh, it's nice
to meet you, Miss...

494
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:18,327
- Reed. Jenna Reed.
- Joe Cooper. Coop.

495
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:20,871
- I know.
- Are all these kids with you ?

496
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:24,541
Oh, yeah. I've been the director
of the Dream Come True Foundation...

497
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:26,543
since October.

498
00:26:26,627 --> 00:26:29,630
Oh, the ones that grant wishes
to sick and dying kids, right ?

499
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:33,050
Well, we prefer to think
of them as health-challenged...

500
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:35,052
and survival-impaired.

501
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,679
- You're a big fan of BASEketball ?
- No, not really.

502
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:39,723
I mean, the kids
are big fans.

503
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:42,518
I try and keep them interested in things
that are a little more permanent.

504
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:45,062
Permanent ?

505
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:47,356
You know how
professional athletes come and go.

506
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,983
Not in BASEketball.
There's rules against it.

507
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:52,903
Well, hello.

508
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:54,571
Miss Reed,
this is Remer.

509
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:56,740
Would you like
a fresh pretzel ?

510
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,660
I baked it myself.

511
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,745
Oh. Thank you.

512
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:03,872
- It goes great with mustard.
- Okay.

513
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:05,874
Miss Reed.
Miss Reed.

514
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:07,876
Dude, you didn't make
that pretzel, did you ?

515
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:11,547
- Of course not, but chicks
like guys who can cook.
- What ?

516
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:14,341
See, it works.
She was checking out my ass.

517
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:17,553
- She wasn't checking out your ass.
- All set then ?

518
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:20,722
I better get these kids back.
Little Travis is getting impatient.

519
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:23,016
Hey, I love kids.
Which one's Travis ?

520
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:26,061
- Here. Heads up, big guy.
- Uhh !

521
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:28,689
- Are you all right, Travis ?
- I think he's sleeping.

522
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:31,024
He needs a little work
on the hands.

523
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:34,611
- He's blind, Doug.
- Ah !

524
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:36,780


525
00:27:36,864 --> 00:27:39,950
Felons Fans rejoiced in their team's
Denslow Cup victory...

526
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:43,245
with a huge celebration
in downtown Dallas.

527
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:46,748
Final tally:
14 injured, three dead.

528
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:50,377
And on a sad note, the sports world
was devastated tonight...

529
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,629
by the passing
of Ted Denslow.

530
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:56,049
By all accounts, the late Beers owner
seemed to be the only one...

531
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:58,051
surprised by his death.

532
00:27:58,135 --> 00:28:00,512
And it appears time
just finally ran out...

533
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:02,472
for the old cocksucker.

534
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,475
Theodore Denslow,
dead at 85.

535
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:08,145
His hairpiece was 24.

536
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:12,149
 These chaps I wore in
Rootin' Tootin' Rhythm...

537
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:13,567
 These chaps I wore in
Rootin' Tootin' Rhythm...

538
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:16,153
I bequeath
to my nephew Herman.

539
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:19,406
Hope he looks
as snappy in them as I did.

540
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:23,994
And this poncho that kept me dry
during the filming of-

541
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:26,413
Mrs. Denslow.
Baxter Cain.

542
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:28,582
- May I sit down ?
- Of course.

543
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:32,753
-My deepest sympathy on your great loss.
-Thank you, Mr. Cain.

544
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:35,714
My valuable hand-painted plate
commemorating the pope's visit...

545
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:38,342
to Dodger Stadium,

546
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:40,344
I leave to my niece Susan.

547
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:43,138
-  Aw !
- Limited edition, signed in the mold,

548
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:47,768
- with a photocopied certificate
of authenticity.
- Jenna.

549
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:50,312
- This six-shooter I wore--
- What are you doing here ?

550
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:53,690
Well, I'm not sure.
I-- I got this letter.

551
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:55,984
Yeah, yeah, me, too.

552
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:59,071
And the toothbrush
used to clean the oats...

553
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:02,282
- Oh !
-

554
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:04,409
-  Clumsy idiot !
- Where's the body ?

555
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:07,412
They buried him two days ago.
This is the will reading.

556
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:10,749
Oh. Well, in that case--
These are for you, Jenna.

557
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:13,585
Now as a special
fluke of charity,

558
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:18,090
I bequeath these season tickets
to the Dream Come True Foundation.

559
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,175
-Thank you.

560
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:23,428
I had nothing but respect
for your late husband.

561
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:27,140
Unfortunately, he was
the one person who stood in the way...

562
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,559
of making any kind
of changes in BASEketball...

563
00:29:29,643 --> 00:29:32,562
that might increase
the owners' profits.

564
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:36,525
I can't imagine what he had
against making money.

565
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:41,571
-I trust that quality
isn't sexually transmitted.

566
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:46,827
- That's pretty sweet, huh ?
- Yeah.

567
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,912
The kids will be
very excited.

568
00:29:48,996 --> 00:29:52,165
- Especially little Joey.
- Joey ?

569
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,543
Well, he's such
a big fan of yours.

570
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:57,170
He's going
into the hospital next week,

571
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,715
and he begged me to ask you
if you'd come by for a visit.

572
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,717
But it's not a good idea.

573
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,387
- I'd love to come by.
- Hey, I'll come by. I like hospitals.

574
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,681
No, you don't.
You like Taco Bell.

575
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:10,225
I went to this hospital in France
and got together with this chick.

576
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:13,353
- Dude, that was a hostel.
- Oh, yeah.

577
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:16,565
And finally, of course,
my beloved Beers,

578
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:19,484
I bequeath
controlling interest to...

579
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:21,695
Joseph R. Cooper.

580
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:23,905


581
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:25,699
Yes !
We own the team !

582
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:29,745
I gave him the best three months
of my life.

583
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:32,330
- Sweet !
-

584
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:35,083
- Way to go, dude !
- And, Coop ?

585
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:38,545
Yes, Mr. Denslow ?

586
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:42,841
I know you have it in you to lead
the Beers to victory this season...

587
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:46,428
because if you don't,
the team reverts to Yvette.

588
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:50,098
-  What ?
- Don't feel badly
about losing the team.

589
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:53,602
I believe this is merely
a temporary situation.

590
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:55,937
Thank you, Mr. Cain.

591
00:30:56,021 --> 00:31:01,318
It's nice to have a strong,
handsome man like you on my side.

592
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:05,864
Well, yes. I'd love
to discuss this further with you.

593
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:08,408
Why don't you
visit sometime ?

594
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:11,453
Maybe we could, uh...

595
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,955
Iay some carpet,

596
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:16,291
if you know what I mean.

597
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:19,628
 At this time, I'd like
to ask everyone to leave the room...

598
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:23,048
so I can have
a private moment with Coop.

599
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:29,429
Now that we're alone, Coop,
there's something I wanna tell you.

600
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:31,598
Remember when you had
the crabs...

601
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:35,102
-and the only thing that made you
feel better was this lotion ?

602
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:37,312
Well, I found
another use for it.

603
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:41,316
It feels so good,
it makes me wanna sing.

604
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:46,113
Just like that night we spent in the
tattoo parlor in Chicago. Come on, baby.

605
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:49,241
 I'm too sexy
for my shirt

606
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:51,284
-Too sexy for my shirt

607
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:54,788
 So sexy it hurts

608
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:57,999
 And I'm too sexy
for my car

609
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:02,003
 Too sexy for my car
Too sexy by far

610
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:03,755
You gettin' this ?

611
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:16,643
That's two rooms done.

612
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:18,728
Boy, those corners
are tricky.

613
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:21,273
You've done a fine job,
Yvette.

614
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:24,818
Now, as I was saying, I think
I've come up with a plan...

615
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:28,321
to make sure that Coop
never wins that Denslow Cup.

616
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:31,366
Oh. So then
the team will be mine ?

617
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,952
- Yes.
- That's wonderful, Baxter.

618
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:36,621
Do you want me to move on
to the conference room ?

619
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:38,623
No. Not yet.

620
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:43,503
But you know, I think my lobby
could use a good buffing,

621
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:45,505
if you know what I mean.

622
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:48,717
Mmm. I know exactly
what you mean.

623
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,719
Oh !


624
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:54,264
Oh, God ! Oh !
Oh, I can't do this shit !

625
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:57,893
 And the Beers coming up to bat...

626
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:01,354
for the first time
in this season opener against Miami,

627
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:04,399
a game they have dedicated
to Ted Denslow,

628
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:09,821
a team wearing black
in memory of the late Beers owner.

629
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:13,575
The Beers cheerleaders
also mourning the loss.

630
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,577
 Glamour is a rocky road

631
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:19,372


632
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:22,751
 Mmm !

633
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,837
Mmm ! Mmm !

634
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:27,881


635
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:31,384
 Skin flicks, lipstick
Baby scribbles in the mirror

636
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:33,386
 Drama overdosage

637
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:37,641
Dude, it's a whole different ball game
now that you own the team.

638
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:41,353
Yeah. I was just thinking.
Denslow was right.

639
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:44,439
This season could be different.
We just gotta kick some ass.

640
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:47,442
We're playing to keep this team.
You up for it ?

641
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,527
Dude, I'm in,
all or nothin'.

642
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:51,696
- Glamour is a rocky road 


643
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:54,824
 Glamour is a rocky road

644
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:56,534
 Glamour is a rocky road

645
00:33:56,618 --> 00:34:00,455
Joining us in the booth this evening,
big fan of BASEketball, Tony Nochelino,

646
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:03,833
who plays, as you know,
latino cutup Scooter...

647
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:06,294
on the new hit comedy series
What's the Difference ?

648
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:09,589
Airing between Recycled Junk,
starring Lisa Campbell,

649
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:12,884
and Same Old Crap,
featuring teen heartthrob Mark Swenson.

650
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:15,345
All part
of the great fall lineup...

651
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:17,514
on our network's
"Who Gives a Rat's Ass" Thursdays.

652
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:21,977
- And, Tony, it is great
to have you with us.
- So Miami takes the field.

653
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,229
- And we're underway here tonight.
-

654
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:28,149
- Coop steps into the single square.
-

655
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:31,278
-  "Coop ! Coop ! Coop !"
- Bonehead !  ldiota !

656
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:36,241
It's good. And the Beers are off
to a promising start tonight.

657
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:40,412
-And this game is made
all the more special...

658
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:44,499
- by the fact
it's Free Range Chicken Night.
-

659
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:47,460
The Beers up by two, but the Dealers
are threatening here with one out.

660
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:50,505
And that brings up
Enrique Hernandez.

661
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:54,801
 Psych-out ! Psych-out !

662
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:57,971
-Hernandez, look.

663
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:01,349
It's fat liposuctioned
out of Marlon Brando's ass.

664
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:04,978
Uh, aw, no.
What am I doing here ?

665
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:09,774
Ah-- Aw, it's all
salty and warm.

666
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:12,319
Oh, why would
I do this ?

667
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,572
This guy ate
a lot of pork. Aw !

668
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:18,158
- Muy bueno.
-

669
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:21,494
- Damn it !
- Dude, I thought
it was a killer psych-out.

670
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:24,873
- Really ? So sick.
- Shake it off. Shake it off.
I got this guy.

671
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:27,709
- Yo, Gomez.
-  Psych-out !

672
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:28,668
- Yo, Gomez.
-  Psych-out !

673
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:32,213
- Got milk ?
-

674
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:35,675
Oh, yeah, you like that,
don't you ?

675
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:39,596
 Coop tips, and it's good !
Double play. Beers win.

676
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:43,892
 And Remer still
nailing down that psych-out.

677
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,519


678
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,107


679
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,401
Dude, we totally
kicked ass.

680
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:55,570
Yeah, and this
is just a start.

681
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:59,324
- Doug, could you sign my chicken ?
- Joe Cooper. Baxter Cain.

682
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,868
Oh, Cain. Yeah,
Denslow told me about you.

683
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:04,662
I want to welcome you
to our community of owners.

684
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:07,540
If there's anything that you need,
don't hesitate to ask.

685
00:36:07,624 --> 00:36:09,542
Thanks, dude. Later.

686
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:11,586
We're going to be
voting next week...

687
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:13,922
on making some changes
in BASEketball's rules.

688
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:16,966
- I want to tell the others
that you're with us.
- Why ? BASEketball's fine.

689
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,968
Of course,
in some respects.

690
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:22,389
But until we allow teams to move
cities and players to change teams...

691
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:25,266
and take advantage
of lucrative corporate tie-ins,

692
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:29,396
you and your colleagues are going to
have to continue working for-

693
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,943
- Chicken poo ?
- Ugh !

694
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:38,279
Feed. Chicken feed.

695
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:41,324
Coop, the ball
is in your court.

696
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:45,328
In order for those rules to change,
every owner has to vote yes.

697
00:36:45,412 --> 00:36:48,665
Denslow was already filthy rich.
He didn't need the changes.

698
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:50,667
- But you do.
-

699
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,752
Look, I appreciate
what you're saying,

700
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:55,797
but you're asking me to go against
every reason we created this game.

701
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,175
Well, before you make
any hasty decisions, discuss
it with your teammate.

702
00:36:59,259 --> 00:37:02,637
I don't have to.
We're best friends. We think alike.

703
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,181
Look, I'm sorry, but if
you want unanimous consent,

704
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:08,268
you're gonna have to get it
from one of the other owners.

705
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:19,737
- Are we gonna kick their ass ?
- Whoo ! Whoo ! Whoo !

706
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:21,739
- Yeah !
- Yeah !

707
00:37:21,823 --> 00:37:24,826
- We're gonna take
these mooks out or what ?
- Yeah ! Let me handle this one !

708
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:28,037
- In the river, baby ! Come on !
- No doubt about it !

709
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:32,917
- Yo, Coop !
Your mother's a terrible cook !
-

710
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:34,961


711
00:37:36,713 --> 00:37:38,756
- Oh, yeah !
- Damn !

712
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,967
-I'm gonna kick your ass, Mary.

713
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,261
Easy.

714
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:55,607
- Can't gross me out, Remer.
- Oh, yeah ? Well, check out Coop.

715
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:03,239


716
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:05,783
- Aw !
-

717
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:10,622


718
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:22,050
Hey, Zane,
I wanna feel you...

719
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,011
deep inside me.

720
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:26,804
- Oh !
- Yes !

721
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:31,976
-You can't do that !
That's not fair, man !

722
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:36,940
Oh, come on, Zane. That was-- That
was fair. Come on. Let's play ball.

723
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:41,069
Hey, Watson, have you seen
those beer commercials ?

724
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,530
 How to speak San Franciscan.

725
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:45,823
- Hey !
- "Vajoina" !

726
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:48,785
-Not fair ! That's bullshit, man !

727
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:53,665
That wasn't a gay joke.
That was an Australian joke. Aw !

728
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:00,797
-Shoot 'em up shoot 'em up, boys

729
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,299
 Bang, bang
whoo, whoo

730
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:08,304
 Yeah, ride 'em, ride 'em
ride 'em, ride 'em

731
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:11,099
- Come on, let's do it !
- What do we always say ?

732
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:14,644
 One, two, three !
Fuck the Mexicans !

733
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,818
Duh, guess I'll
take my shot now.

734
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:25,697
Sure hope I make it so I can get home
quick and smack my wife in the eye.

735
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:29,701
- Shut up, Remer.
- Shut your mouth, bitch. I'll-

736
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:33,329
Yeah ! Yes !
All right !

737
00:39:33,413 --> 00:39:36,249
- Take that, Remer !
- Aw, shit !

738
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:38,876


739
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,838
 Du-du-du-du

740
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:44,007
 Du-du-du-du

741
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,509
 Du-du-du-du

742
00:39:46,593 --> 00:39:49,971
- Du-du-du-du 
-

743
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:52,849


744
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:56,728


745
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:00,857
Oh, my eye ! My eye !

746
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,234
 You're sick, Cooper !

747
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:06,154
- Yeah !
- Whoo-hoo !

748
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,827
If a woman wants a mate
ho is responsive,

749
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,622
she will reveal to him
the secret of a woman's duality.

750
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:19,292
She will tell him
about the interior woman,

751
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:22,128
that one who added
to herself makes two.

752
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:26,215
-  Paging Dr. White.
- I didn't expect you'd come.

753
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:28,926
I thought I'd say hi
to our little friend Joey.

754
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:32,639
Oh. Well, he's sleeping,
and I really wanted to finish this book.

755
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:35,183
- Well, maybe it'll
make him feel better. Joey ?
- Uh, well-

756
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,730
Joey ?
Look who's here.

757
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:43,107
My biological father ?

758
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:45,735
No, dude, it's me,
Joe Cooper.

759
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:49,030
- Coop ? Coop, is it really you ?
- Yeah, it's me.

760
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:53,076
Wow. I watched all your road games.
Your psych-outs were the best.

761
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:56,412
- Thanks, dude. Right on.
- Coop, what's a "vajoina" ?

762
00:40:56,496 --> 00:41:00,208
Uh, so, uh, what seems
to be the problem with you, guy ?

763
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:03,294
I'm-- I'm going to die.

764
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:06,923
- Well, we're all gonna die.
- Yeah, but not this week.

765
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:10,426
Joey, what did I tell you
about staying positive ?

766
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:13,471
Besides, your donor liver's
due to arrive today.

767
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:16,265
Oh, hey, look
what I brought you.

768
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:19,852
- Wow ! A La-Z-Boy !
- Yeah, I made it myself, you know.

769
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:22,980
If I had a nickel for every time
this ball pulled me out of a tight spot,

770
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:25,858
I'd have a shitload
of nickels.

771
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:29,237
Gee, Coop, I wanna be
just like you when I grow up.

772
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,699
Here's your
decaf mocha, Jenna.

773
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:35,660
Just like you take it:
Nonfat milk, low fat whipped cream...

774
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:38,705
- and a little sprinkle of cinnamon.
- Thank you, Doug.

775
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:41,749
And I baked you fresh
poppyseed muffins, too.

776
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,960
Oh.

777
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:45,962
Give me a break.

778
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:50,007
Poppyseed muffins.
I thought you had your
electrolysis appointment this morning.

779
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:52,635
I did. Here.
Look. Check it out.

780
00:41:55,138 --> 00:41:56,931
Hey, listen, partner,

781
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:59,559
I talked to the people
at the Dream Come True Foundation,

782
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:02,770
and they want
to make your last wish-

783
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:05,982
Your-- Well, they want
to make your dream come true,

784
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:10,361
as long as it doesn't involve, like,
a miracle cure or something like that.

785
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:13,406
Well, hell, the guys on death row
only get a meal, right ?

786
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:16,659
Uh, so--
so, what's your dream ?

787
00:42:16,743 --> 00:42:20,079
Well, I've always dreamed
of big game hunting.

788
00:42:20,163 --> 00:42:24,751
How about killing an endangered species,
like a bald eagle or a giant panda ?

789
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:28,004
Joey, I don't think that's in
the true spirit of the foundation.

790
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:30,298
Well, how about
poisoning the reservoir ?

791
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,758
I know. How about throwing flesh-eating
fish into a public swimming pool ?

792
00:42:31,758 --> 00:42:34,552
I know. How about throwing flesh-eating
fish into a public swimming pool ?

793
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:37,263
I don't think you're quite
getting the point, dude.

794
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:39,432
Come on, Joey.
Search your heart.

795
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:44,395
What's the one thing that you want
more than anything else in the world ?

796
00:42:44,437 --> 00:42:47,356
Chelsea Clinton.

797
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,902
That's a pretty tall order,
dude.

798
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:54,113
You'd have a better shot
at Bill.

799
00:42:54,197 --> 00:42:56,282
You have any backup dreams ?

800
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:59,035
Well, there is
one other thing.

801
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:01,954
Could I just once--
Could I hang out with the team ?

802
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:04,916
Just spend a day
with the Beers. Could l, Coop ?

803
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:08,044
Oh, l-l don't know.

804
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:11,088
And Miss Reed, too.

805
00:43:15,802 --> 00:43:17,303
 Why can't we be friends

806
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:19,639
 Why can't we be friends

807
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:21,933
 Why can't we be friends

808
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:24,727
 Why can't we be friends

809
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:29,816
 I seen ya, I seen ya, I seen ya 'round
for a long, long time

810
00:43:29,899 --> 00:43:33,903
 I really, I really, I really remember
when you drank my wine

811
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:35,947
 Why can't we be friends

812
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:38,950
 Why can't we be friends

813
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:40,952
 Why can't we be friends

814
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:43,830
 Why can't we be friends

815
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:49,001
 I seen ya, I seen ya, I seen ya
walkin' down in Chinatown

816
00:43:49,085 --> 00:43:53,840
 I called ya, I called ya, I called ya,
but you did not look around, yeah

817
00:43:53,923 --> 00:43:57,969
 I pay my, I pay my
I pay my money to the welfare line

818
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:02,223
 I seen ya, I seen ya, I seen ya
standin' in it every time

819
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:04,392
 Why can't we be friends

820
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:09,355
 Why can't we be friends
Why can't we be friends

821
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:11,649
 Why can't we be friends

822
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:13,776
 Why can't we be friends

823
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:17,280
-Why can't we be friends

824
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:21,534
 Don't be jealous when you see me
in those fancy clothes

825
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:23,578
Down the hatch. Bartender.

826
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,913


827
00:44:27,957 --> 00:44:33,045
This has been so fun. I feel like
I'm gonna puke all over the bar.

828
00:44:33,129 --> 00:44:36,382
 Oh, look, Jerry Springer.

829
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:40,803
- Here she is, your daughter-in-law--
-  She's my son's wife.

830
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:43,055
- Get that.
-

831
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:45,558
Nicole.
Let's say hi to Nicole.

832
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:49,520
-We'll drink every time
a fight breaks out.

833
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:52,398
- All right. Jerry ! Jerry !
- Jerry ! Jerry !

834
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:55,109
- What's up ?
- Hey, you bitch !

835
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:57,153
Oh, fight, fight, fight.

836
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:59,488
- Back off, bitch !

837
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:03,659
- Oh, you want some of this ? Come on !
- You fat-

838
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:06,329
Fight !

839
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:09,373
-Ah ! Ah !

840
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:12,293
 I'm gon' kill you !

841
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:14,337


842
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,839
You see, Joey,
dreams really do come true.

843
00:45:31,938 --> 00:45:35,399
- You're the best, Coop.
- Yeah.

844
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:37,902
Oh, man, it's late.
We've got a game tonight.

845
00:45:37,944 --> 00:45:40,905
And you've got
that big liver operation.

846
00:45:40,947 --> 00:45:44,742
- Yeah, but--
- What, dude ? You're gonna be fine.

847
00:45:44,784 --> 00:45:47,620
I just know
I could pull through if-

848
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:50,873
- If what, dude ?
- Joey, just say it and Coop will do it.

849
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:54,210
Could you, Coop ? Do you think
you could hit a home run for me...

850
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:56,212
in tonight's game ?

851
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:59,966
- Well, dude--
- It's not like he's asking you
to hit two home runs.

852
00:46:00,049 --> 00:46:02,760
Two ? Can you hit
two home runs ?

853
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:05,846
Of course he could. This is
Coop Cooper you're talking about.

854
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:09,058
Hell, he could hit three home runs
if he wanted to, huh, Coop ?

855
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:11,936
Three ? All right.

856
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:15,064
Remer, can I talk to you
over there real quick ?

857
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:17,024
Thanks.

858
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:20,903
Hey, you know, Joey, I've hit
my fair share of home runs, too.

859
00:46:20,945 --> 00:46:23,698
That's nice, but Coop's gonna
hit three home runs for me.

860
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:26,242
- That's great, Joey.
-

861
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:29,370
I think Coop's the greatest guy
in the whole wide world.

862
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:31,539
Yeah, he's a major
dude, all right.

863
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:34,250
- There, I feel much better now.
- Aah !

864
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,127
- Mr. Squeak ?
- What ?

865
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:38,170
What grade are you in ?

866
00:46:38,254 --> 00:46:42,049
Hey, anybody call
a taxi ?

867
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:45,970
- I called a taxi.
- We gotta get going if
I'm gonna hit those home runs.

868
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:48,931
Don't you worry.
From now on, everything's gonna be A-OK.

869
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:52,435
Gee, Coop, this is
the best day of my entire life.

870
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:54,311
- Oh !
-

871
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:56,939
Oh, my, what a story
this is.

872
00:46:56,981 --> 00:47:01,736
Little Joey Thomas undergoing
a lifesaving operation tonight.

873
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:05,406
-The fans here, of course,
all wearing yellow ribbons...

874
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:09,952
in support
of this brave little boy.

875
00:47:10,036 --> 00:47:13,372
 And his hero, Joe Cooper,
promising to hit three home runs,

876
00:47:13,456 --> 00:47:17,585
a promise that could mean
the difference between life and death...

877
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:20,379
- for this brave little boy.
-

878
00:47:20,463 --> 00:47:23,299
Hey, Pete, what's the matter
with Coop tonight ?

879
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:27,011
I don't know, but he's one for 11
and he smells like Christian Slater.

880
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:29,847
 Coop in the home run circle,
getting ready to take his shot.

881
00:47:29,889 --> 00:47:31,974
It's up. It's good !

882
00:47:32,016 --> 00:47:34,977
-Coop sinks his second
home run of the game.

883
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:40,107


884
00:47:43,736 --> 00:47:45,821
His blood sugar's way up
since yesterday.

885
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,990
Has there been any change
in his fluid intake ?

886
00:47:48,074 --> 00:47:50,409
Sweet Jesus ! His sodium's level
through the roof !

887
00:47:50,493 --> 00:47:53,120
It's the strangest thing.
He's eight years old,

888
00:47:53,204 --> 00:47:55,331
and he smells like
Robert Downey, Jr.

889
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:58,417
 Ninth inning.
Everyone's stomach in knots here,

890
00:47:58,501 --> 00:48:00,753
as Coop steps up
for his last at bat.

891
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:03,589
-  Coop ! Coop !
- One more chance
for that third home run.

892
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:10,346
Hey, she's here, man,
that girl from the bar.

893
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:12,598
- That's a guy.
- What ?

894
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:15,935
- A guy ?
- Yeah, that's a dude.

895
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:19,021
You're just saying that 'cause
you want her for yourself.

896
00:48:19,105 --> 00:48:21,565
I'm saying that
because she's a guy.

897
00:48:21,649 --> 00:48:24,360
It's impossible.
Just look at her.

898
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:26,862
She's got the cutest
little upturned nose,

899
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:30,825
the softest lips,
the sweetest Adam's apple.

900
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:32,993


901
00:48:33,077 --> 00:48:36,914
Yeah. I think I can smell
her perfume from here.

902
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:40,209


903
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:43,295


904
00:48:43,379 --> 00:48:45,506


905
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:49,635
 Coop ! Coop ! Coop ! Coop !

906
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:51,804
Shh.

907
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:54,140
 Shh.

908
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:58,978
 Coop calls for quiet.

909
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:01,564
One more chance
for that third home run.

910
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:04,900
He's in deep focus
out there, Bob.

911
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:07,069
This obviously means
a lot to him.

912
00:49:07,153 --> 00:49:10,823


913
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:13,492
-  He shoots !
-  It's going, going-

914
00:49:13,576 --> 00:49:16,704
Looks like Coop
has made a dream come true...

915
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:19,915
- for a very brave little--
-

916
00:49:19,999 --> 00:49:21,709


917
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:28,591
Wow. The Lord must really
have it in for that little boy.

918
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:35,806
Oh, why ? Why ? Why ?

919
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:38,392
Come on, Coop.
It's over.

920
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:41,562
- Poor Joey. Why ?
- I'm sorry, dude.

921
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:43,564
If you're looking
for Joey Thomas,

922
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:45,649
he's been moved
next door.

923
00:49:45,733 --> 00:49:47,818
- Oh.
- Hey !

924
00:49:50,029 --> 00:49:52,531
Oh, my God !

925
00:49:52,615 --> 00:49:56,118
Oh, why ? Why ? Why ?

926
00:49:56,202 --> 00:49:58,245
Gentlemen,
he's in this room.

927
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:04,835
Joey ! Joey !
I'm here for you, dude.

928
00:50:04,919 --> 00:50:07,171
The operation
went fine.

929
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:10,132
Just after your game,
we thought he was suffocating.

930
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:13,552
He kept screaming, "Choke ! Choke !"
and lost consciousness.

931
00:50:13,636 --> 00:50:15,888
He'll be fine
in the morning.

932
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:17,890
But don't stay too long.
He needs his sleep.

933
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:22,561
Joey, I'm sorry
I missed that third home run.

934
00:50:22,645 --> 00:50:26,440
-But remember how I said that
dreams really do come true ?

935
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:29,109
- Well, they don't.
- Mm !

936
00:50:29,193 --> 00:50:31,487
Coop, he's awake !
He's trying to tell you something.

937
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:34,323
-Wha-what is it, Joey ? What ?

938
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:37,743
- Hey, he's turning blue.
- Oh, my God ! This poor kid's freezing.

939
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:40,246
He needs a blanket.
Where's a blanket ?

940
00:50:40,329 --> 00:50:43,249
- Sir, sir, Can I borrow your blanket ?
- I'm here for you, Joey.

941
00:50:43,332 --> 00:50:46,168
- Let me borrow your blanket !
- Aaaah !

942
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:49,004
Here you go, little buddy.
This should keep you warm.

943
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:51,674
-He's flatlining ! You killed him.

944
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,884
- Oh, my God !
- I didn't kill him.

945
00:50:53,968 --> 00:50:56,845
Dude, you missed the third home run
and you killed him.

946
00:50:56,929 --> 00:50:59,556
-No ! No, I'm not gonna
give up on this kid !

947
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:01,892
-  Coop, calm down, man.
- Come on, Joey. Come back to me.

948
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:04,144
- Coop, get a hold of yourself.
- Leave me alone !

949
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:08,232
- Live, damn it ! Live !
- What the hell are you doing ?

950
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:10,818
Where are those heart paddle things
that George Clooney uses ?

951
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:12,987
- Not those.
- Dude, let's just bail.

952
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,990
- Give me these things.
- You're gonna kill him !
- Clear !

953
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:19,034
- Clear !
-

954
00:51:19,118 --> 00:51:21,412
- No pulse, Coop.
- Crank up the voltage.
- Ten thousand volts.

955
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:24,164
- Clear !
- Clear !
-

956
00:51:24,248 --> 00:51:26,917


957
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:29,920
- Up it to 15,000 !
- Fifteen thousand volts.

958
00:51:30,004 --> 00:51:32,506
- No ! No !
- Clear !

959
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:36,760


960
00:51:36,844 --> 00:51:39,680
- Coop, do you know what you're doing ?
- What's it look like ?

961
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:43,058
- An execution ?
- I'm tryin' to save a life !

962
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:47,146
 I'm givin' it
all I've got, Captain.

963
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:49,148
 I love ya, always have.

964
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:51,150


965
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:53,235
Clear !

966
00:51:53,277 --> 00:51:56,572
-This isn't working.

967
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:59,491
We gotta try open heart massage.
I need a rib separator and a scalpel.

968
00:51:59,575 --> 00:52:03,203
- Where do I cut ?
- Start in the middle
and work your way around.

969
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:06,749
Code blue, Nurse ! Seventy cc's
of sodium pentothal, stat !

970
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:08,667
-I didn't kill him.

971
00:52:08,751 --> 00:52:10,544
Get away from him.
Get out of here.

972
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:12,629
- Cardiac syringe comin' through !
-

973
00:52:12,713 --> 00:52:16,216
-Oh ! Oh !

974
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:21,638
- Help me !
-

975
00:52:21,722 --> 00:52:24,141
- Hard left ! Hard left !
- What the-

976
00:52:24,183 --> 00:52:28,312


977
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:30,939
 Reggie Jackson
having an incredible night.

978
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:34,526
-  Reggie ! Reggie !
- Two for two, with a walk,
four runs batted in.

979
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:37,071
And he's already hit
two home runs tonight.

980
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:40,324
And you have to wonder just what
Charlie Hough must be thinking,

981
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:43,035
as Reggie steps into the box
here in the eighth.

982
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:45,371
-  Reggie ! Reggie !
- There's a fly ball-

983
00:52:45,454 --> 00:52:48,332
- ... nature's fury
when man and beast collide...

984
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:51,460
on the back roads
and byways of America.

985
00:52:58,801 --> 00:53:00,719
Aw !

986
00:53:00,803 --> 00:53:03,347
- Aw ! Aw !
-

987
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:06,183


988
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:10,729
I can't believe
those assholes taped over the game.

989
00:53:10,813 --> 00:53:12,731
-Aw !

990
00:53:12,815 --> 00:53:14,316


991
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,485
- Aw !
-

992
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:21,281
- Jenna.
- Hi.

993
00:53:21,365 --> 00:53:23,617
Oh, I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

994
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:26,870
No, no, I was just
fixing clam chowder.

995
00:53:26,954 --> 00:53:28,872
Uh, come in.

996
00:53:28,956 --> 00:53:31,959
Well, when you weren't
at the hospital, I came right over.

997
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:35,504
Apparently, there was some sort
of terrorist attack on the post-op ward.

998
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:37,756
- Terrorist ?
- Yeah.

999
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:41,301
Evidently, they were disguised
as BASEketball players.

1000
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:44,221
They went on some sort of rampage,
and I was so worried about...

1001
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:46,223
Joey.

1002
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:48,225
Was he, uh--
Is he-

1003
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:51,645
Oh, he's fine. He came through
the operation with flying colors.

1004
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:55,858
With that new liver, he should be
peeing like a champ in no time.

1005
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:59,111
- That's kidneys, Coop.
- Oh.

1006
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:01,655
Well, uh, have a seat.

1007
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:05,909
I just wanted to stop by and thank you
for all you've done for Joey.

1008
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:07,911
Oh, it's nothing.

1009
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:11,915
I'm sure he's going to remember
this day for the rest of his life.

1010
00:54:11,999 --> 00:54:14,168
Yeah, I don't doubt that.

1011
00:54:15,419 --> 00:54:19,214
Oh ! What a great picture.


1012
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:21,508
Look at you guys.
You seem so happy.

1013
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:23,969
Yeah, l-l guess we were.

1014
00:54:24,052 --> 00:54:27,097
We were just best friends
playing ball in the driveway.

1015
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:31,018
Next thing I know,
I'm on ESPN and Wheaties boxes.

1016
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:33,353
And I guess
it's all pretty sweet.

1017
00:54:33,437 --> 00:54:36,273
But nowadays,
since Denslow's been gone,

1018
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:40,277
I'm in charge of the team,
and the whole league now.

1019
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:44,364
-Sometimes I forget why I play the game.
-Why do you play it, Coop ?

1020
00:54:44,448 --> 00:54:48,702
- Mr. October.
- The guy in the Chippendales calendar ?

1021
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:50,662
No, that was
Dwayne Zackemore.

1022
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:56,126
I mean...
whoever it was that month.

1023
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:58,128
I'm talking
about Reggie Jackson.

1024
00:54:58,212 --> 00:55:00,589
I saw him play
in a World Series once.

1025
00:55:00,631 --> 00:55:04,593
He hit three home runs in one game.
I caught the third one in the stands.

1026
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:07,137
I remember growing up,
it meant so much to me.

1027
00:55:07,221 --> 00:55:11,767
All I ever dreamed of was to be
that guy, have that one shining moment.

1028
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:17,940
- Be a hero.
- You already are a hero, Coop.

1029
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:21,151
You've won
these kids' hearts, but-

1030
00:55:21,235 --> 00:55:25,447
- What ?
- Well, I'm just worried
about getting attached-

1031
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:27,866
I mean, the kids
getting attached.

1032
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:30,577
I don't want them
to be hurt.

1033
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:35,999
Jenna, I would never do
anything to hurt these kids.

1034
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:39,211
But what Joey
really needs to know...

1035
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:42,506
is where are you
going to be next year.

1036
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:44,633
Right here.

1037
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:48,220
And the next year,
and the year after that.

1038
00:55:49,805 --> 00:55:52,683
Right up
until Joey grows up...

1039
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:55,435
and gets
a driver's license...

1040
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:59,147
and... starts going out
with girls...

1041
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:02,109
and meets
the right one...

1042
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:05,279
and forgets about
BASEketball altogether.

1043
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:09,408


1044
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:11,702
Goes home,
does some push-ups,

1045
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:13,829
fucks the sleeve
of his favorite jacket.

1046
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:15,872
- What ?
- Huh ?

1047
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:20,002
I'm-l'm just saying
we'll be here for Joey. I promise.

1048
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:23,672
Oh, Coop, I want to believe you. I want
to believe you more than anything-

1049
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:28,093
Coop, check out all this cool shit
we got at the hospital !

1050
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:30,095
- Ooh, hey, Jenna.
- Hey, Doug.

1051
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:32,889
Wow. You're looking a little flushed.
Do you have a temperature ?

1052
00:56:32,931 --> 00:56:35,267
- No. I'm-l'm fine.
- Open your blouse and say "Ahh."

1053
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:37,644
- Remer !
- Doug, l-- I gotta go.

1054
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:39,855
- No, Jenna--
- Yeah, I'm sorry. I gotta go.

1055
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:42,107
Jenna-- Aw !

1056
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:46,403
Aw ! Thanks a lot, Dr. Dickhead.
You totally fucked me there.

1057
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:48,447
Dude, relax.
It was just a joke.

1058
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:52,034
- Dude, give it up.
She doesn't even like you.
- Oh, she has the hots for you ?

1059
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:55,370
- Squeak has a better chance
with her than you do.
- Hey, you think ?

1060
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:57,956
- That's low, you son of a bitch.
- Why is that low ?

1061
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:59,958
I know you're
jealous right now,

1062
00:57:00,042 --> 00:57:02,628
but you can't blame me
because I have a sweet ass.

1063
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:04,630
I can't help it.

1064
00:57:04,713 --> 00:57:07,466
 I'm doin' the Happy Dance.

1065
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:09,926
Doin' the Happy Dance.

1066
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:12,679
- Does this thing work ?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

1067
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:15,098
- Can you hear me in this ?
- Yeah, yeah. Check it out.

1068
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:18,101
- Asshole !
-

1069
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:20,729
- You wanna get a sandwich ?
- Yeah, let's get a sandwich.

1070
00:57:20,771 --> 00:57:24,566
- Yeah, let's get a sandwich.
- Goddamn. Oh.

1071
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:27,069
 Mr. Cain,
Doug Remer is here to see you.

1072
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:29,071
 Remer ? I thought
I asked him to come tomorrow.

1073
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:31,365
Well, yes, sir, but he's
here now in the trophy room.

1074
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:34,159
- The trophy room ?
- Mr. Cain-

1075
00:57:34,201 --> 00:57:38,622
Mr. Cain. Mr. Cain ?

1076
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:40,624
Sweet.

1077
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:51,927


1078
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:59,643
-Mr. Remer.

1079
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:01,645
Oh, hey.
Mr. Cain.

1080
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:04,690
I see you've been
admiring my museum.

1081
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:06,858
- Is that really--
- Yes.

1082
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:09,111
When I see something I want,
I get it.

1083
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:12,656
Remind me the next time you're here
to show you the prize in the collection.

1084
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:16,827
My autographed
Ty Cobb bat.

1085
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:20,038
I'm planning to expand
the museum out here next year.

1086
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:22,040
Killer setup,
Mr. Cain.

1087
00:58:22,082 --> 00:58:24,126
- What do you pay in rent here ?
- Nothing. I own it.

1088
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:26,253
Oh, that reminds me.
Can you break a 20 ?

1089
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:29,047
- What, dollars ?
- I didn't think so.

1090
00:58:29,131 --> 00:58:31,091
Let me get straight
to the point, Don.

1091
00:58:31,133 --> 00:58:33,093
- May I call you Don ?
- Yeah, I guess so.

1092
00:58:33,135 --> 00:58:35,512
Don, when I see one of
BASEketball's hottest stars...

1093
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:39,057
with less than $20 in his pocket,
driving an American car,

1094
00:58:39,099 --> 00:58:41,309
sharing a small house
with two other guys,

1095
00:58:41,393 --> 00:58:43,770
you know what
that says to me ?

1096
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:48,358
- Homos ?
- No, no, no.
It says you're underappreciated.

1097
00:58:48,442 --> 00:58:53,405
- And underpaid !
- Oh, yeah, I mean,
I guess we are underpaid.

1098
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:57,033
I want to change all that.
Players of your caliber
should be making the big bucks.

1099
00:58:57,117 --> 00:58:59,411
Don't you agree ?

1100
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:01,955
Remer ! Remer !

1101
00:59:03,415 --> 00:59:06,334
-Try to stay with me on this, all right?
-All right.

1102
00:59:06,418 --> 00:59:09,087
Now, last week, I tried to get Coop
to agree to certain rule changes...

1103
00:59:09,171 --> 00:59:11,173
that would
make you millions.

1104
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:13,383
- Me ? Millions ?
- Now listen carefully.

1105
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:16,928
Do you think Shaq got rich
playing in Orlando ?

1106
00:59:17,012 --> 00:59:19,598
Hardly. He made his fortune
moving to L.A.

1107
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:21,600
You know how much
he makes now ?

1108
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:23,852
As much as he made
playing in college ?

1109
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:27,856
What ? No !
Lots more-- big money.

1110
00:59:27,939 --> 00:59:30,442
- And you can too !
- Would I have to quit BASEketball ?

1111
00:59:30,484 --> 00:59:34,196
What ? No ! I need you
to get Coop to go along !

1112
00:59:34,279 --> 00:59:36,948
He'd have
to quit BASEketball too ?

1113
00:59:37,032 --> 00:59:39,493


1114
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:43,455
- Did I just fart ?
- Uhh !

1115
00:59:43,497 --> 00:59:45,457


1116
00:59:52,172 --> 00:59:55,467
 Top of the seventh,
and those cheers you're hearing...

1117
00:59:55,509 --> 01:00:00,639
are from the nearly 15,000 on
hand here for Anal Probe Night.

1118
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:04,518
So, two outs, and Doug Remer
heading for the triple square.

1119
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:08,563
He's 0 for 12 so far tonight.
In fact, with the exception of Coop,

1120
01:00:08,647 --> 01:00:10,565
the Beers are ice-cold.

1121
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:15,153
 Oh, man, that
doesn't even qualify as an air ball !

1122
01:00:15,237 --> 01:00:19,074
And the Beers are gone
in the seventh.

1123
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:21,535
The Aliens now coming up
with the top of their order.

1124
01:00:21,576 --> 01:00:23,829
Which, if you're
scoring at home,

1125
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:26,122
is the same three guys
who came up last inning.

1126
01:00:26,206 --> 01:00:28,875
All right, what the hell's going on ?
You guys are lying down out there !

1127
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:31,962
Oh, I get it.
You guys are pissed off.

1128
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:34,464
Uh, why ?

1129
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:39,678
Dude, you turned down Cain's offer
without talkin' to us.

1130
01:00:39,761 --> 01:00:41,596
- Mm-hmm !
- Yeah.

1131
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:45,517
All right,
what do you want, dude ?

1132
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:48,186
Dude, what do you think ?
We invented this game together,

1133
01:00:48,228 --> 01:00:50,188
but you get to
control everything.

1134
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:52,732
- Listen, Cain has some
pretty good ideas--
- Dude, Denslow gave me the team.

1135
01:00:52,816 --> 01:00:56,278
- I already told Cain no.
- Dude, I'm sure Denslow is happy
in his little worm farm but-

1136
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:59,656
- Dude, I'm not gonna do it.
- All right, dude,
listen to me carefully.

1137
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:01,783
Do you think Shaq got rich
playing in Orlando ?

1138
01:01:01,867 --> 01:01:04,369
No, he got rich playing in college.
Everybody knows that.

1139
01:01:04,452 --> 01:01:08,039
Dude, it's not about the money.
It's about tradition.

1140
01:01:08,123 --> 01:01:11,084
Look, think about the greats
who have played this game.

1141
01:01:11,126 --> 01:01:17,132
It's because of them.
It's because of us that I can't
bow down to a guy like Cain.

1142
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:20,135
That's easy for you to say, 'cause you
got the team ! We got jack shit !

1143
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:22,971
- Even Squeak is pissed off !
- Hell, I never really minded.

1144
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:25,682
Shut up, bitch ! Dude, quit thinkin'
about yourself for a change !

1145
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:28,393
Dude, I'm not gonna cave in.
End of story, dude.

1146
01:01:28,435 --> 01:01:32,022
- Dude.
- Dude !
- Dude !

1147
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:34,065
Dude !
Dude.

1148
01:01:36,443 --> 01:01:39,446
Well, I guess you've got
a point there.

1149
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:44,326
All right, maybe I was wrong.
From now on, we're full partners.

1150
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:48,413
- Really ?
- And you guys-- you all
own part of the team too.

1151
01:01:48,455 --> 01:01:51,082
Really ? You'd be willing
to do that for us ?

1152
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:54,002
Yeah, and that's not all. I'm talkin'
prime equity stock options,

1153
01:01:54,085 --> 01:01:56,963
comprehensive health care,
full dental, traveling H.M.O.,

1154
01:01:57,047 --> 01:01:59,382
and the first 20 weeks
of psychiatric care free of charge-

1155
01:01:59,466 --> 01:02:01,384
- the way it should be !
-  Yeah !

1156
01:02:01,468 --> 01:02:04,554
 You've been psyched
You're goin' down

1157
01:02:04,638 --> 01:02:06,598
 I'm a trash-talkin'
talented, no-class clown

1158
01:02:06,681 --> 01:02:09,684
 I wanna abuse you
until you lose

1159
01:02:09,768 --> 01:02:13,563
- You can go on home and pout
You've been psyched out 
- Yes !

1160
01:02:13,647 --> 01:02:15,857


1161
01:02:15,941 --> 01:02:17,943
Go, Beers !

1162
01:02:25,951 --> 01:02:27,786


1163
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:30,455
Hey, Smitz, you wanna see
a scary face ?

1164
01:02:30,538 --> 01:02:32,791


1165
01:02:32,874 --> 01:02:35,126
Yeah !

1166
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:37,170
- What ?
- Dude !

1167
01:02:37,212 --> 01:02:39,631
 You ain't cut
from the right cloth

1168
01:02:39,673 --> 01:02:43,969
 You don't got what it takes
Now you blew it, oh

1169
01:02:44,052 --> 01:02:48,431
 Another stupid mistake
Another bad, bad break

1170
01:02:48,515 --> 01:02:51,601
 You been psyched out
and you're goin' down

1171
01:02:51,685 --> 01:02:54,646
 I'm a trash-talkin'
talented, no-class clown

1172
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:57,357
 I will abuse you
until you lose

1173
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:01,069
- You can go on home and pout
You've been psyched out 
- He can't do that !

1174
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:02,988
- You've been psyched
but you can't know me 
-

1175
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:06,992
- 'Cause I'm a dirty bastard 
- He's a dirty bastard

1176
01:03:08,535 --> 01:03:11,705
Oh... Oh...
Oh, shit !

1177
01:03:13,873 --> 01:03:16,418
 You can't handle
the pressure

1178
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:19,129
 Keep your head in the game

1179
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:22,966
 You can't do it
and it's a cryin' shame

1180
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:25,552
- But you're not to blame 
- Aaah !

1181
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:28,471
- Oooh, ugh !
- Wait a minute !

1182
01:03:28,555 --> 01:03:31,391
Aaah !

1183
01:03:31,433 --> 01:03:33,393


1184
01:03:37,605 --> 01:03:39,733
Y-Y-Y-Yeow !

1185
01:03:39,774 --> 01:03:41,735
 Sticks and stones
will break your bones

1186
01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:44,571
 But words will
drive you insane

1187
01:03:44,612 --> 01:03:47,574
 There were four
of them in the corral:

1188
01:03:47,615 --> 01:03:49,909
The once-proud beast,
the broken girl,

1189
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:53,913
her mother, and finally,
the man they called The Whisperer.

1190
01:03:53,997 --> 01:03:57,083
The woman
stared hopefully...

1191
01:03:57,167 --> 01:03:59,127
into the ancient cowboy's
weathered face.

1192
01:03:59,169 --> 01:04:04,758
"Can you help her ?"
"Lady, I repair cows, not people."

1193
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:10,764
- His disjointed voice seemed
to be coming from afar.
-

1194
01:04:10,805 --> 01:04:14,768
 The Beers win their tenth
consecutive game. I don't know-

1195
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:16,811
Who's this bimbo
Coop's got the hots for ?

1196
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:21,149
Oh, that's Jenna Reed. She's
the director of some kids' charity, um-

1197
01:04:21,191 --> 01:04:23,151
Dream Come True
Foundation.

1198
01:04:23,193 --> 01:04:26,571
Ah. I know six men
on their board of directors.

1199
01:04:26,654 --> 01:04:30,450
Baxter Cain is not going quietly
into the good night.

1200
01:04:30,492 --> 01:04:33,536
Hey, Baxter ?
Who's Ty Cobb ?

1201
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:36,498
- Oh, my God !
- Did I just fart ?

1202
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:39,334
Ohh !

1203
01:04:39,459 --> 01:04:42,337


1204
01:04:58,603 --> 01:05:01,648
 Ninth inning. Beers just
one out away from making the play-offs.

1205
01:05:01,689 --> 01:05:06,236
They'll have to get by Big Ed Tuttle
and the L.A. Riots to ice this one.

1206
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:08,822
That's him, Squeak.
That's Tuttle.

1207
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:11,449
He's been talkin' some serious shit
about you all night.

1208
01:05:11,533 --> 01:05:13,451
Yeah, he told everyone
that he caught you...

1209
01:05:13,535 --> 01:05:15,662
jacking off in the bathroom
before the game.

1210
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:17,997
He saw that ?

1211
01:05:18,039 --> 01:05:20,834
You oughta get this guy,
Squeak.

1212
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:23,336
Look at him, man.
He's huge !

1213
01:05:23,378 --> 01:05:25,505
You want me
to psych him out ?

1214
01:05:25,547 --> 01:05:29,384
- Dude, he'll never expect it
coming from you.
- Here, say this.

1215
01:05:31,469 --> 01:05:33,388
I'm not gonna
remember all that !

1216
01:05:33,471 --> 01:05:35,890
-All right, here then.
-C'mon, this is for the play-offs, dude.

1217
01:05:35,974 --> 01:05:38,393
If you get this guy,
we're in !

1218
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:40,395
Don't worry,
we've got your back !

1219
01:05:57,162 --> 01:05:59,372
- Hey, Tuttle !
- Yeah ?

1220
01:06:01,082 --> 01:06:05,086
- Your mother's deaf.
- My mother's dead, you little twerp.

1221
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:11,301
I guess that's why
she didn't move around a lot.

1222
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:13,553


1223
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:15,805
 Unbelievable. The Beers win !

1224
01:06:15,889 --> 01:06:19,309
- Yes ! Sweet !
- The Beers have done it !

1225
01:06:19,392 --> 01:06:21,895
- Dude ! Sweet ! Yes !
- Ohh !

1226
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:27,483
 Talkin' away, I don't know
what's left to say

1227
01:06:27,567 --> 01:06:29,277
 I'll say it anyway

1228
01:06:29,319 --> 01:06:31,279
 The Beers win
a spot in the play-offs...

1229
01:06:31,321 --> 01:06:34,991
by beating Los Angeles on
an unlikely psych-out by Squeak Scolari.

1230
01:06:35,074 --> 01:06:37,076
 Take on me

1231
01:06:38,453 --> 01:06:40,580
- Take me on 
- Dude, he is pissed !

1232
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:44,500
- I didn't go over
the line on that, did I ?
- No, not at all.

1233
01:06:44,584 --> 01:06:46,502
Don't worry about it,
dude.

1234
01:06:47,754 --> 01:06:50,924
Jenna ! Jenna !

1235
01:06:50,965 --> 01:06:53,760
Hey, you missed it.
We won !

1236
01:06:53,801 --> 01:06:56,930
We kicked ass ! Let 'em flow, baby.
We're in the play-offs !

1237
01:06:56,971 --> 01:07:00,642
Yeah, let the tears come.
You're gonna make me start crying now.

1238
01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:02,644
- No.
- I guess this really is emotional.

1239
01:07:02,727 --> 01:07:06,105
- Should we just cry ?
- I think we should. No one's watching.

1240
01:07:06,147 --> 01:07:10,109
- We won the game, we've got
friends, we've got everything !
- Will you stop that ?

1241
01:07:10,193 --> 01:07:12,987
I'm not crying
because I'm happy.

1242
01:07:13,071 --> 01:07:15,198
I just got the news
our funding's been cut.

1243
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:17,825
They're gonna close
the foundation !

1244
01:07:17,909 --> 01:07:20,870
-Can they do that ?

1245
01:07:20,954 --> 01:07:24,499
Oh, no. Those poor kids.
We can't let this happen.

1246
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:26,501
We gotta do
something !

1247
01:07:26,584 --> 01:07:31,089
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to come here and ruin your big night.

1248
01:07:31,172 --> 01:07:33,341
I'm sorry !

1249
01:07:33,424 --> 01:07:35,301
No, Jenna.
Jenna, wait.

1250
01:07:35,343 --> 01:07:38,471
- Gentlemen !
- Mr. Cain !

1251
01:07:38,513 --> 01:07:41,641
I couldn't help but overhear
your conversation with Miss Reed.

1252
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:45,311
- Dude, what are you doing here ?
- I jet here, I jet there.

1253
01:07:45,395 --> 01:07:47,647
Anyway, I just wanted
to assure you there's no reason...

1254
01:07:47,689 --> 01:07:49,983
for your girlfriend's foundation
to go into Chapter 11-

1255
01:07:50,024 --> 01:07:51,985
or for that matter,
12, 13 or 14.

1256
01:07:52,026 --> 01:07:54,570
Uh, but I think I may have
a solution to her problem.

1257
01:07:54,654 --> 01:07:57,031
There.

1258
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:59,534
It's a time-tested moneymaker.
Every athlete does it.

1259
01:07:59,617 --> 01:08:02,662
- You want me to have bigger titties ?
- What ?

1260
01:08:02,704 --> 01:08:05,373
No, no.

1261
01:08:05,456 --> 01:08:09,043
It's a clothing line--
a Beers clothing line.

1262
01:08:09,127 --> 01:08:12,171
No, dude, that's against
the BASEketball bylaws.

1263
01:08:12,255 --> 01:08:14,215
Not if the proceeds
go to charity.

1264
01:08:14,257 --> 01:08:18,720
Think about it. Miss Reed's
foundation will never have
to worry about funding again.

1265
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:22,056
Awesome, Dude !
I think we should definitely do it !

1266
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:24,392
'Scuse us.

1267
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:26,602
-Will you let me do the talking here ?

1268
01:08:26,686 --> 01:08:28,688
There's no way I'm doing any kind
of deal with this piece of shit.

1269
01:08:28,730 --> 01:08:31,941
Wait, I thought it was we. Remember,
it's not just up to you anymore.

1270
01:08:32,025 --> 01:08:34,569
All right, we can come up with
a better way to get money for Jenna.

1271
01:08:34,652 --> 01:08:36,779
Like, how ?

1272
01:08:38,865 --> 01:08:41,451
- See ? Thought so. Mr. Cain ?
- Hmm ?

1273
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:44,746
As part owner of the Beers,
I'd just like to say, where do I sign ?

1274
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:47,373
Congratulations, Don.
This is gonna change your life.

1275
01:08:47,457 --> 01:08:49,667
I look out
for my "wimmins" !

1276
01:08:49,751 --> 01:08:51,711
Before we discuss
fabric or color,

1277
01:08:51,753 --> 01:08:54,714
-  Freedom ! Freedom !
- we gotta decide where we
can make this stuff cheap.

1278
01:08:54,756 --> 01:08:57,717
We'll do a big media blitz. And don't
worry about Coop. He'll come around.

1279
01:08:57,759 --> 01:09:01,721


1280
01:09:04,098 --> 01:09:06,017
 I'm a scat man

1281
01:09:10,355 --> 01:09:14,400


1282
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:29,624
- Hi there, I'm Dan Patrick.
- And I'm Kenny Mayne.

1283
01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:32,794
With the first seven months of the
BASEketball post-season out of the way,

1284
01:09:32,877 --> 01:09:35,505
the play-off picture is now
starting to emerge.

1285
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:39,801
So with last night's victory
over Boston, next week the Beers
must beat lndianapolis...

1286
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:43,930
to advance to Charlotte--
that's in an effort to reduce
their magic number to three.

1287
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:48,309
Right, and the Beers can advance
to the National Eastern Division
North to play Tampa.

1288
01:09:48,393 --> 01:09:50,770
So, if the Beers beat Detroit
and Denver beats Atlanta...

1289
01:09:50,812 --> 01:09:53,773
in the American Southwestern
Division East Northern,

1290
01:09:53,815 --> 01:09:55,775
then Milwaukee goes
to the Denslow Cup,

1291
01:09:55,817 --> 01:09:58,528
unless Baltimore upsets Buffalo
and Charlotte ties Toronto.

1292
01:09:58,611 --> 01:10:02,198
Then Oakland would play
L.A. and Pittsburgh
in a blind choice round-robin.

1293
01:10:02,281 --> 01:10:05,952
If no clear winner emerges
from all this, the two-man
sack race will be held...

1294
01:10:05,993 --> 01:10:08,871
- on consecutive Sundays
till a champion is crowned.
- Right.

1295
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:20,925
 Dude ! Dude ! Dude !

1296
01:10:21,008 --> 01:10:25,221
After the grueling,
regular BASEketball season,

1297
01:10:25,304 --> 01:10:28,891
we're now in month nine
of the play-offs.

1298
01:10:30,309 --> 01:10:32,228
No, Daddy,
don't touch me there !

1299
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:36,816
The Beers,
vying with San Francisco...

1300
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:39,944
for a slot in
the Denslow Cup game.

1301
01:10:40,027 --> 01:10:42,280
Ninth inning, Ferries up by one,
Coop steps in.

1302
01:10:42,363 --> 01:10:44,824
It's back,
way back-

1303
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:47,785
Good ! Home run !
Coop ties it up !

1304
01:10:47,869 --> 01:10:50,496
- That could mean extra innings.
- Ugh !

1305
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:52,999


1306
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:54,750
 Everybody's downtown

1307
01:10:54,834 --> 01:10:56,752
 Everybody's downtown

1308
01:10:56,836 --> 01:10:58,504
 Everybody's downtown

1309
01:10:58,588 --> 01:11:00,882
 Come on, let's go
Let's hear it

1310
01:11:00,965 --> 01:11:02,675
 Everybody's downtown

1311
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:04,177
 Everybody's downtown

1312
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:05,720
 Everybody's downtown

1313
01:11:05,803 --> 01:11:08,014
- Come on, let's go, let's hear it 
-

1314
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:11,142
 Foxy, foxy teaser

1315
01:11:11,225 --> 01:11:14,187
 Little kid's
got a mondo fever

1316
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:16,189
-What's this guy ?

1317
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:19,233
He's my entertainment lawyer.
He's helping me with my movie contract.

1318
01:11:19,317 --> 01:11:22,153
Oh, now you're such a big shot, you're
gonna act in a Hollywood movie ?

1319
01:11:22,236 --> 01:11:25,239
- Fuckin' sellout.
- Now shooting, number 17:

1320
01:11:25,323 --> 01:11:29,076
Doug "Sir Swish" Remer !

1321
01:11:36,209 --> 01:11:38,211
 Superstar

1322
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:41,130
 Can't run, can't shoot
Bring on the beat

1323
01:11:41,214 --> 01:11:45,468
 Funky girls really
turn up the heat

1324
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:49,222
 Can't run, can't shoot
Repeat

1325
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:51,224


1326
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:54,435
 Beers win ! Beers win !

1327
01:11:54,519 --> 01:11:56,687
 And the Beers have done it !

1328
01:11:56,771 --> 01:12:00,107
They're on their way
to the Denslow Cup !

1329
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:01,943
 Everybody's downtown

1330
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:03,945
 Everybody's downtown

1331
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:05,947
 Everybody's downtown

1332
01:12:05,988 --> 01:12:08,950


1333
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:16,541
- Dude, who is that ?
- Who's it look like ?

1334
01:12:16,624 --> 01:12:18,709
Victoria Silvstedt,
Playmate of the Year.

1335
01:12:18,793 --> 01:12:22,296
Hello ! Victoria Silvstedt,
Playmate of the Year !

1336
01:12:28,302 --> 01:12:31,222
- What's that ?
- It's a commitment ring.

1337
01:12:31,305 --> 01:12:35,226
- What, for Jenna ?
- Yeah, I'm letting her know
that I'm ready to consider...

1338
01:12:35,309 --> 01:12:38,145
thinking about dating her
exclusively.

1339
01:12:38,229 --> 01:12:40,982
Well, I'm giving Jenna a pre-commitment
ring. It's a promise to pledge...

1340
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:44,110
that we'll think about getting
engaged just as soon as we're
ready to make a commitment.

1341
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:46,821
What the hell are you talking about ?
You don't care about Jenna !

1342
01:12:46,904 --> 01:12:50,825
You were just in a hot tub naked
with Victoria Silvstedt,
Playmate of the Year !

1343
01:12:50,866 --> 01:12:53,160
You know what ? That hurts, man.
That really hurts.

1344
01:12:53,202 --> 01:12:56,330
My clothing line is single-handedly
saving Jenna's foundation.

1345
01:12:56,372 --> 01:13:01,002
Oh, sorry, I forgot about
how much Doug Remer cares about kids.

1346
01:13:01,085 --> 01:13:03,588
- Gentlemen !
- Mr. Cain !

1347
01:13:03,671 --> 01:13:05,756
Hate to interrupt your celebration,
but I have something...

1348
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,800
you might be
interested in.

1349
01:13:09,677 --> 01:13:12,888
Go ahead, don't be shy.
It concerns you.

1350
01:13:12,972 --> 01:13:15,683
Open it !
I think you'll find it interesting.

1351
01:13:15,725 --> 01:13:19,353
- What's that old saying, uh--
- "A penny saved is a penny earned" ?

1352
01:13:19,437 --> 01:13:21,689
- "Don't eat cheese before noon--"
- Shut up !

1353
01:13:21,772 --> 01:13:26,527
How about "One picture
is worth a thousand words."

1354
01:13:26,611 --> 01:13:29,030
- Oh, that's a good one !
-  God, these are awful !

1355
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:31,866
- What kind of lowlife scum
would use children this way ?
- You would.

1356
01:13:31,949 --> 01:13:34,327
Me ? Never !

1357
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:38,456
Gentlemen, those are pictures
of the Beers clothing line...

1358
01:13:38,539 --> 01:13:41,459
being made in Calcutta.

1359
01:13:41,542 --> 01:13:44,503
- Oh, just great !
- Of course, if they ever get out,

1360
01:13:44,587 --> 01:13:49,050
the Beers, and your girlfriend's
little foundation, would be ruined.

1361
01:13:49,133 --> 01:13:53,054
- Yipes !
- But, rest assured, there's
no reason to be panicked.

1362
01:13:53,095 --> 01:13:58,225
Those pictures never have to
see the light of day, if-

1363
01:13:58,309 --> 01:14:00,603
If what ?

1364
01:14:03,814 --> 01:14:06,734
If you two miss
the next Beers game.

1365
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:09,862
Dude, the next game
is the Denslow Cup !

1366
01:14:09,945 --> 01:14:12,156
I can see you've been
reading the papers.

1367
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:16,744
Listen, boys, do as I say.
You play ball, and you'll be just fine.

1368
01:14:16,827 --> 01:14:18,746
I thought you said
you didn't want us to play ball.

1369
01:14:18,829 --> 01:14:22,375
I want you to play ball...
with me.

1370
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:24,502
You want us
to play for Dallas ?

1371
01:14:24,585 --> 01:14:29,006
Uh, uh, uh !

1372
01:14:29,090 --> 01:14:31,509
Oh, I get it. You don't want us
to show up at the game at all !

1373
01:14:31,592 --> 01:14:34,387
Of course, you numbskulls !
It's called blackmail !

1374
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:38,224
Good evening !

1375
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:45,106
Goddamn it, Remer, I told you
this was gonna happen, didn't I ?

1376
01:14:45,189 --> 01:14:48,651
If you would have agreed
to Cain's changes it never
would have gotten this far !

1377
01:14:48,693 --> 01:14:52,071
- Dude, because of you, Jenna's
foundation is totally screwed !
- Me ?

1378
01:14:52,154 --> 01:14:54,073
- Oh, there you are !
- Jenna !

1379
01:14:55,157 --> 01:14:59,078
I saw the pictures !
This is awful !

1380
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:02,289
It's gonna mean the end of
the foundation. It's not endowed like-

1381
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:04,583
Well, like-

1382
01:15:04,667 --> 01:15:06,585
Jenna,
I can explain.

1383
01:15:06,669 --> 01:15:09,797
- Yes, it was his fault.
- Me ?

1384
01:15:09,839 --> 01:15:12,383
This is your mess, Remer.
I shoulda kept the team to myself !

1385
01:15:12,466 --> 01:15:14,385
Dude, I don't know you
anymore !

1386
01:15:14,468 --> 01:15:16,429
Enough !
Look at yourselves.

1387
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:20,057
You're just typical men,
with humongous... egos !

1388
01:15:20,141 --> 01:15:22,852
You're like every other
pro athlete. I should have
kept those kids away from you.

1389
01:15:22,935 --> 01:15:26,230
Their lives are ruined
and all you can do is argue
about who is the bigger penis ?

1390
01:15:26,313 --> 01:15:27,898
I mean, child.

1391
01:15:27,982 --> 01:15:32,278
Long wanger. Oh !
Throbbing cock. Aaah !

1392
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:34,280
Oh, God, I don't even know
what I mean anymore !

1393
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:36,657
- Jenna, wait !
- You've gotta believe us, Jenna !

1394
01:15:36,699 --> 01:15:39,493
It was all
Coop's fault !

1395
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:41,996
- Dude, could I talk to you over here ?
- Mm-hmm.

1396
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:43,998
You know something, Pig Fucker ?
Can I call you Pig Fucker ?

1397
01:15:44,081 --> 01:15:46,000
No, only my friends
can call me Pig Fucker.

1398
01:15:46,083 --> 01:15:48,085
- Aaaah !
-

1399
01:15:48,169 --> 01:15:51,297
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow !

1400
01:15:52,715 --> 01:15:56,218
You know what, Coop ?
You're not my best friend anymore.

1401
01:15:56,302 --> 01:15:58,345
- How do you like that ?
- I love it !

1402
01:15:58,429 --> 01:16:00,431
Good, I'm glad !

1403
01:16:00,514 --> 01:16:04,602
I'm sick of playing
second fiddle to you, and you
gettin' all the recognition.

1404
01:16:04,685 --> 01:16:08,397
I'm gettin' myself
a new best friend.

1405
01:16:08,481 --> 01:16:12,526
- Wake up, bitch.
You're my new best friend.
- Really ? What ?

1406
01:16:12,610 --> 01:16:14,528
Are we going
to the zoo ?

1407
01:16:14,612 --> 01:16:19,408
Fine ! I don't need you.
I'll get myself a new best friend too !

1408
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:24,121
So go ahead. Go back to your fancy cars,
and your big bank accounts,

1409
01:16:24,205 --> 01:16:28,375
and your celebrity friends,
and your beautiful women,

1410
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:31,879
and Victoria Silvstedt,
Playmate of the Year.

1411
01:16:31,962 --> 01:16:33,881
Fuck !

1412
01:16:33,964 --> 01:16:37,718
 Your life is spinnin'
out of control

1413
01:16:37,802 --> 01:16:42,890
 Seems the whole world
is out to get you

1414
01:16:42,973 --> 01:16:47,478
 Everything is wrong
Nothin' seems right

1415
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:53,359
 There's a sinking feeling
inside

1416
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:57,488
 Even your best friend
has turned his back

1417
01:16:57,571 --> 01:16:59,990
 But you can't let it
bring you down

1418
01:17:00,074 --> 01:17:03,160
 No, you've got to fight

1419
01:17:05,246 --> 01:17:10,459
 'Cause you try
but you can't let go

1420
01:17:10,543 --> 01:17:13,420
 It's when you're down
that you gotta get up

1421
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:16,882
 Don't let 'em walk
all over your face

1422
01:17:16,966 --> 01:17:18,926
 Stand up for yourself

1423
01:17:19,009 --> 01:17:23,097
 And make everything
right again

1424
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:25,850
 Even if some guy's tryin'
to blackmail you

1425
01:17:25,933 --> 01:17:28,769
 And your girlfriend
thinks you suck

1426
01:17:28,853 --> 01:17:30,771
 It's up to you
to let them know

1427
01:17:30,855 --> 01:17:35,609
 That it was all part of
some rich guy's evil plan

1428
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:37,736
 Look out ahead
There's a truck changin' lanes

1429
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:41,073
-You got some yellow crumbs
on your upper lip

1430
01:17:41,156 --> 01:17:43,701
 And those warts on your dick
aren't gonna go away

1431
01:17:43,784 --> 01:17:46,161
 'Less you start using
topical cream everyday

1432
01:17:46,161 --> 01:17:47,079
 'Less you start using
topical cream everyday

1433
01:17:47,162 --> 01:17:51,041
 Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to
Calcutta lnternational Airport,

1434
01:17:51,125 --> 01:17:55,838
where it is currently 95 degrees
with a light drizzle.

1435
01:17:55,921 --> 01:17:59,800
We hope you enjoy your stay here
in lovely Calcutta.

1436
01:18:00,885 --> 01:18:03,721
Taxi !

1437
01:18:03,804 --> 01:18:08,934
- Amoka, come on !
- Aw, c'mon ! Driver, I'm in a hurry !

1438
01:18:09,018 --> 01:18:12,438
- Look, just take me to 7-1-1-- Aw !
-

1439
01:18:18,152 --> 01:18:20,112
Here you are,
Beerswear Factory.

1440
01:18:20,154 --> 01:18:22,615
- Hey, you, is this--
- I'm sorry, no entrance-

1441
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:25,326
- Who the hell are you ?
- I factory manager. Who you ?

1442
01:18:25,409 --> 01:18:27,703
I Joe Cooper--
I mean, I'm Joe Cooper.

1443
01:18:27,786 --> 01:18:30,247
Wait, Mr. Cooper,
you must put on hard hat !

1444
01:18:30,289 --> 01:18:34,543
Aw, this is awful.
Aw, this isn't good !

1445
01:18:34,627 --> 01:18:36,545
Do any authorities know
about this ?

1446
01:18:36,629 --> 01:18:38,547
- Aw ! Aw !
- Wait, wait, please, Mr. Cooper !

1447
01:18:38,631 --> 01:18:41,091
Put that down !

1448
01:18:41,216 --> 01:18:44,970


1449
01:18:45,012 --> 01:18:47,640
 A young man. His whole life
in front of him disappears.

1450
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:51,685
A familiar story, yes.
But this is no ordinary Joe.

1451
01:18:51,769 --> 01:18:57,316
Joseph R. Cooper, perhaps the most loved
sports figure in the country-- vanished.

1452
01:18:57,399 --> 01:19:01,946
According to Mrs. Elsie Melcher, a
neighbor who asked not to be identified,

1453
01:19:02,029 --> 01:19:05,240
Joe Cooper left his house
two weeks ago.

1454
01:19:05,324 --> 01:19:08,953
According to Angelique Bones,
a nosy bitch who lives up the street,

1455
01:19:09,036 --> 01:19:11,497
he took with him only
a toothbrush, a wallet,

1456
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:15,084
a steamer trunk
and a plane ticket to Calcutta.

1457
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:18,504
Police theorize several possible
scenarios of what happened...

1458
01:19:18,545 --> 01:19:21,423
to the man affectionately
known to the world as "Coop."

1459
01:19:21,507 --> 01:19:23,717
I don't know where
the hell he is.

1460
01:19:23,801 --> 01:19:27,304
For all I care, he could be hanging
by his neck in his fuckin' closet.

1461
01:19:27,388 --> 01:19:29,932
Scenario Number One: He's hanging
by his neck in his fucking closet.

1462
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:37,856
The night before his disappearance,
Coop's girlfriend had paid him a visit.

1463
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:40,484
According to friends,
they had quarreled.

1464
01:19:40,526 --> 01:19:43,821
If you're looking for Joe Cooper,
I suggest you look wherever you find...

1465
01:19:43,904 --> 01:19:48,534
the most heinous, blatant and vile
exploitation of children on the planet.

1466
01:19:48,617 --> 01:19:52,746
Scenario Number Two:
Coop went to Disney World.

1467
01:19:55,499 --> 01:20:00,212
Here's a photograph of Joe Cooper taken
just days before his disappearance.

1468
01:20:00,254 --> 01:20:05,050
Here's a computer-enhanced simulation
of what he might look like today.

1469
01:20:07,469 --> 01:20:10,431
 From Milwaukee, Wisconsin,
on the shores of Lake Michigan,

1470
01:20:10,514 --> 01:20:14,351
it's the Denslow Cup, where
the defending champion Dallas Felons...

1471
01:20:14,393 --> 01:20:18,063
meet their perennial challengers
the Milwaukee Beers.

1472
01:20:18,147 --> 01:20:21,191
Hello, I'm AI Michaels
along with Bob Costas inviting you...

1473
01:20:21,275 --> 01:20:24,319
to join us here at Beers Garden
for Denslow Cup V.

1474
01:20:24,403 --> 01:20:27,364
And we're in for
a classic battle tonight.

1475
01:20:27,406 --> 01:20:29,408
You're absolutely right
about that, Al.

1476
01:20:29,450 --> 01:20:33,037
We have over a hundred million
people throughout the world
tuned in to see this game.

1477
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:36,248
Many of them, of course, with no
understanding of the sport itself,

1478
01:20:36,290 --> 01:20:40,586
but nonetheless fascinated
by the flickering images
and the bright, pretty colors.

1479
01:20:40,627 --> 01:20:46,258
High up in the stands, pyrotechnic
expert Sergio "Lucky" Ferouch...

1480
01:20:46,341 --> 01:20:50,179
is readying another spectacular,
halftime fireworks display.

1481
01:20:50,262 --> 01:20:52,598
All right, you guys.
You ready to kick some ass ?

1482
01:20:55,309 --> 01:20:58,395
What's wrong, you guys ?
Why the long faces ?

1483
01:20:58,437 --> 01:21:00,773
We miss Coop.
Can't win without him.

1484
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:04,068
We don't need Coop.
I'll lead you to victory !

1485
01:21:04,151 --> 01:21:07,196
We're supposed to be a team.
Without Coop it's not the same.

1486
01:21:07,279 --> 01:21:09,907
Look, even if Coop
was to walk in here right now,

1487
01:21:09,948 --> 01:21:11,909
it wouldn't change
the outcome of this game one iota.

1488
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:15,162
- We can win this thing !
Are you with me ?
- Yeah, yeah !

1489
01:21:15,245 --> 01:21:18,082
- That's the spirit. Are you with me ?
- Yeah ! Yeah !

1490
01:21:18,165 --> 01:21:20,084
All right, Coop's here !

1491
01:21:25,464 --> 01:21:28,759
 We're underway here for Denslow Cup V.

1492
01:21:54,827 --> 01:21:58,789
 A stunned crowd of
over 18,000 witnessing the Beers...

1493
01:21:58,872 --> 01:22:01,792
being thoroughly dominated by
the Felons. Come on, Beers ! Go, Coop !

1494
01:22:01,834 --> 01:22:05,212
Hey, guys, thought I told you
we weren't gonna watch this game.

1495
01:22:05,295 --> 01:22:08,257
-Oh, come on, Miss Reed.
It's the Denslow Cup !

1496
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:11,301
These are not the kind of people
to be looked up to or emulated.

1497
01:22:11,385 --> 01:22:13,595
 The severed and
mutilated head was postmarked Denver.

1498
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:17,349
The owner still has not
stepped forward.

1499
01:22:17,391 --> 01:22:21,603
Update: The disappearance of
the Milwaukee Beers BASEketball star.

1500
01:22:21,687 --> 01:22:25,858
When Joe Cooper discovered that
the workers in the Beerswear
Factory were youngsters,

1501
01:22:25,899 --> 01:22:29,194
not even old enough for prostitution,
he personally flew to Calcutta.

1502
01:22:29,236 --> 01:22:32,823
His new, all-adult workforce
now makes a decent wage,

1503
01:22:32,906 --> 01:22:35,993
enjoys full medical benefits
and in-house child care.

1504
01:22:36,076 --> 01:22:40,539
All of us here are glad
that such a terrific human being
like Joe Cooper has returned.

1505
01:22:40,581 --> 01:22:43,000
If I were a woman,
I'd sure like to be his girlfriend.

1506
01:22:43,041 --> 01:22:47,379
Walking in the park, hand in hand,
wrapping my legs around him,

1507
01:22:47,462 --> 01:22:50,465
cuddling in the spoon position,
our hearts beating in unison,

1508
01:22:50,549 --> 01:22:54,219
staring into his eyes
over our morning coffee-

1509
01:22:54,261 --> 01:22:56,722
Uh, yes, yes, thank you.

1510
01:22:56,805 --> 01:23:01,602
- When we come back,
our next unsolved mystery--
- Come on, kids.

1511
01:23:01,685 --> 01:23:04,062
- We're going to the game !
-  Yea !

1512
01:23:04,313 --> 01:23:06,064
 Ladies and gentlemen,

1513
01:23:06,106 --> 01:23:08,567
for your seventh-inning stretch
entertainment,

1514
01:23:08,609 --> 01:23:12,279
-the National BASEketball League
is proud to present...

1515
01:23:12,362 --> 01:23:16,867
a salute to our South Sea
neighbors: Viva Calypso !

1516
01:23:19,244 --> 01:23:21,163
We're up 16-nothing
at the break.

1517
01:23:21,246 --> 01:23:23,165
Have the trucks pull up
to the locker room.

1518
01:23:23,248 --> 01:23:26,710
We'll sort out the stuff
when we get to Jacksonville. Okay.

1519
01:23:26,752 --> 01:23:31,256
Hey, Baxter. I finally got
all the chrome off this for you.

1520
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:34,343
- Nice. Very nice.
- You want me to start on this one ?

1521
01:23:34,426 --> 01:23:37,346
 Ladies and gentlemen, please
direct your attention now...

1522
01:23:37,429 --> 01:23:40,766
to the Malaka-Laka
Balance Board of Trust,

1523
01:23:40,807 --> 01:23:45,771
symbol of brotherhood
in many Polynesian countries.

1524
01:23:45,854 --> 01:23:48,106
Assuming the roles of the
downtrodden but happy natives,

1525
01:23:48,190 --> 01:23:52,945
with their good-luck pineapple,
your Milwaukee Beers !

1526
01:23:53,028 --> 01:23:56,240
Thanks for flying back, Coop. You really
made a big difference in the score.

1527
01:23:56,281 --> 01:23:58,951
If I wouldn't have been cleaning
up your mess, I wouldn't be
jet-lagged and shitting curry !

1528
01:23:59,034 --> 01:24:01,703
Hey, guys, knock it off,
all right ?

1529
01:24:01,787 --> 01:24:05,082
 Representing
their white colonial oppressors,

1530
01:24:05,123 --> 01:24:08,418
the Dallas Felons !

1531
01:24:08,502 --> 01:24:10,420
And now, let's all join
our Caribbean brothers...

1532
01:24:10,504 --> 01:24:13,715
in the ceremonial South Sea handshake
above the Lagoon of Peace.

1533
01:24:13,799 --> 01:24:15,259
-  All right, let go !
-  You let go !

1534
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:18,303
Stop it. Stop it !

1535
01:24:18,345 --> 01:24:20,806
- Guys, come on, man !
- Money-grubber !

1536
01:24:20,889 --> 01:24:22,933
- Powermonger !
- Cock !

1537
01:24:23,016 --> 01:24:24,893
 Guys, stop it !

1538
01:24:26,645 --> 01:24:29,273
Whoa !

1539
01:24:29,314 --> 01:24:31,608
-Hey !

1540
01:24:33,819 --> 01:24:36,488
- You son of a bitch !
- You asshole !

1541
01:24:38,490 --> 01:24:40,409
- Die !
- Eat shit !

1542
01:24:40,492 --> 01:24:42,202
Hey ! Would you just stop it ?
Would you hold on a minute ?

1543
01:24:42,202 --> 01:24:44,830
Hey ! Would you just stop it ?
Would you hold on a minute ?

1544
01:24:44,913 --> 01:24:48,292
Look at you guys, fighting
on the Malaka-Laka board !

1545
01:24:48,375 --> 01:24:51,211
You should be ashamed
of yourselves !

1546
01:24:51,295 --> 01:24:54,631
Back in the driveway,
we were nothing !

1547
01:24:54,715 --> 01:24:56,883
Now we've risen
to the highest level,

1548
01:24:56,967 --> 01:25:00,887
but you're
throwin' it all away !

1549
01:25:00,929 --> 01:25:04,308
If you've forgotten
what BASEketball means to America,

1550
01:25:04,391 --> 01:25:09,813
you have only to look at this board--
the Malaka-Laka Balance Board of Trust.

1551
01:25:09,896 --> 01:25:11,940
Don't you see what
we have here ?

1552
01:25:12,024 --> 01:25:15,736
A game where guys
with bad backs and bad knees...

1553
01:25:15,819 --> 01:25:18,196
can get together and compete
on the same field...

1554
01:25:18,238 --> 01:25:22,075
as guys that are all
goosed up on steroids.

1555
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:24,161
But more than anything,

1556
01:25:24,244 --> 01:25:27,831
isn't this game about gettin'
together with your friends
and havin' a good time ?

1557
01:25:29,333 --> 01:25:31,251
I remember-

1558
01:25:32,919 --> 01:25:37,382
I remember a long time ago,
I didn't have anybody.

1559
01:25:37,424 --> 01:25:39,384
You guys took me in.

1560
01:25:39,426 --> 01:25:42,346
I guess that's why it kills me
to see you like this.

1561
01:25:44,765 --> 01:25:49,686
If we can't be friends, then the heart
and soul are out of this game.

1562
01:25:51,688 --> 01:25:56,026
Certainly out of me !
I know I'll never get that back again.

1563
01:25:58,111 --> 01:26:01,823
We have sullied the waters
of the Lagoon of Peace !

1564
01:26:01,907 --> 01:26:06,411
I'm begging you, for the love
of our Caribbean brothers,

1565
01:26:07,537 --> 01:26:09,498
dudes, stop this madness !

1566
01:26:12,334 --> 01:26:14,336


1567
01:26:18,256 --> 01:26:20,550
- Hang on !
- Oh, my God !

1568
01:26:20,634 --> 01:26:22,594
Remember to hold your breath
just before we hit !

1569
01:26:22,677 --> 01:26:25,472
Never let go !

1570
01:26:28,475 --> 01:26:32,854
Bob, this has to be the most spectacular
extravaganza I have ever seen !

1571
01:26:32,938 --> 01:26:36,525
You can cram three seats into the space
it takes for one wheelchair,

1572
01:26:36,608 --> 01:26:39,319
not to mention the wasted space
it takes for the oxygen bottle.

1573
01:26:39,403 --> 01:26:42,614
- Hell, those little shits
never pay full price anyway !
- Baxter !

1574
01:26:42,697 --> 01:26:45,158
I just realized
I can't stand you !

1575
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:48,370
You can kiss
these puppies good-bye !

1576
01:26:50,163 --> 01:26:53,291
 Oh.

1577
01:26:54,751 --> 01:26:56,670
Shit, Coop.
I'm sorry.

1578
01:26:56,753 --> 01:26:59,005
I guess the money
did go to my head.

1579
01:26:59,047 --> 01:27:01,842
No, l--
I'm sorry, Remer.

1580
01:27:01,925 --> 01:27:05,053
I think I've got a lot
to learn about sharing.

1581
01:27:05,137 --> 01:27:08,056
Look at me. I've become
everything I used to hate.

1582
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:11,518
Maybe we--
we just grew up too fast.

1583
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:15,689
My worst enemy
turned out to be me.

1584
01:27:15,772 --> 01:27:18,233
- Dude.
- Dude.

1585
01:27:18,316 --> 01:27:20,235
- Dude.
- Dude.

1586
01:27:23,697 --> 01:27:26,158
Hey, Puck,
I've got two over-

1587
01:27:31,329 --> 01:27:33,248


1588
01:27:33,331 --> 01:27:37,627
- All right, let's go win
ourselves a championship !
- Yeah !

1589
01:27:37,711 --> 01:27:41,465


1590
01:27:51,016 --> 01:27:55,395
 She was
a little green

1591
01:27:55,479 --> 01:27:59,483
 He was just
a little mean

1592
01:27:59,566 --> 01:28:02,777
 They were
together all the time

1593
01:28:02,861 --> 01:28:08,158
 So now no one can forget this thing
that happens all the time

1594
01:28:11,620 --> 01:28:14,998
 She would do anything

1595
01:28:15,081 --> 01:28:17,751
- Yo, Darcy.
- Yeah ?

1596
01:28:17,834 --> 01:28:20,921
- Hey, that's my wife !
- Yeah, and this is me !

1597
01:28:21,004 --> 01:28:23,465
 They live together
all the time

1598
01:28:23,548 --> 01:28:26,635
 So now no one can forget
this little thing

1599
01:28:26,718 --> 01:28:29,471
 That's on her mind

1600
01:28:29,554 --> 01:28:33,934
 It's a waste to wonder
what's a heart these days

1601
01:28:34,017 --> 01:28:38,647
 It takes a lot to get up
and just leave those who--

1602
01:28:38,730 --> 01:28:40,732


1603
01:28:46,571 --> 01:28:48,490
- Hey, Dirk !
- What is it ?

1604
01:28:48,573 --> 01:28:52,369
- I hear your sister's
goin' out with Squeak !
- Aaah !

1605
01:28:58,083 --> 01:29:00,877
 And Squeak Scolari
crosses the plate again...

1606
01:29:00,961 --> 01:29:03,588
as the Beers have come
roaring back since the break.

1607
01:29:03,672 --> 01:29:06,758
Bob, this is more like
the Beers team we've seen all season.

1608
01:29:06,841 --> 01:29:08,677
 Ninth inning, two outs.

1609
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:10,887
Beers still down
by two runs.

1610
01:29:10,971 --> 01:29:13,306
Felons on first and third.

1611
01:29:13,348 --> 01:29:16,518
The Beers have to stop Dallas here
if they want to stay in this game.

1612
01:29:16,601 --> 01:29:19,813
And the always dangerous
Grumsky coming up.

1613
01:29:19,896 --> 01:29:21,856
Get this guy, Coop.
He hasn't missed a shot all night.

1614
01:29:21,940 --> 01:29:24,609
I know, but I don't know what to say.
Nothing works on him.

1615
01:29:24,693 --> 01:29:28,321
- Hey ! Tell him he's fat !
- Dude, that's not cool.

1616
01:29:28,405 --> 01:29:30,323
- Yeah, it is.
- That's not cool.

1617
01:29:30,407 --> 01:29:34,661
- No, no, no. Just do it really subtle.
- Subtle.

1618
01:29:35,787 --> 01:29:38,456
Hey, Grumsky,
you losin' weight ?

1619
01:29:38,540 --> 01:29:41,334
Oh, big ass !
You're fuckin' fat.

1620
01:29:41,418 --> 01:29:44,838
You're goddamn fuckin' fat.
How'd you get so goddamn fuckin' fat ?

1621
01:29:46,673 --> 01:29:50,010
 The Beers hold them
in the ninth on a clutch psych-out...

1622
01:29:50,051 --> 01:29:53,346
by "Coop" Cooper.

1623
01:29:53,471 --> 01:29:57,767
 Coop ! Coop !
Coop ! Coop ! Coop ! Coop !

1624
01:29:57,851 --> 01:30:02,564
 Bottom of the ninth.
Dallas, 16. Milwaukee, 14.

1625
01:30:02,647 --> 01:30:04,899
Remer on second,
Scolari on third.

1626
01:30:04,983 --> 01:30:08,737
Coop's coming up.

1627
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:13,867
And so, it all comes down
to this one shot.

1628
01:30:13,950 --> 01:30:17,203
Coop makes it, the Beers win the cup,
and get to keep the team.

1629
01:30:17,287 --> 01:30:20,165
Or, he misses.

1630
01:30:24,002 --> 01:30:26,421
 Coop ! Coop ! Coop !

1631
01:30:31,092 --> 01:30:33,053


1632
01:30:33,094 --> 01:30:36,556


1633
01:30:38,683 --> 01:30:41,061
 Oh, my God.

1634
01:30:41,144 --> 01:30:43,813
La-Z-Boy has popped !

1635
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:53,406
The ball Coop has used
every day of his career is gone,

1636
01:30:53,490 --> 01:30:57,869
and a time-out has been called
as the Beers star tries to regroup.

1637
01:30:57,911 --> 01:31:01,414
Excuse me, driver,
do you think you could go any faster ?

1638
01:31:01,498 --> 01:31:04,626
Could I go
any faster ?

1639
01:31:04,709 --> 01:31:06,878
- Yea !
- Hang on !

1640
01:31:10,298 --> 01:31:12,258
Yea !

1641
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:14,302
Whoa !

1642
01:31:14,386 --> 01:31:16,304
 No doubt about it, Al.

1643
01:31:16,388 --> 01:31:19,641
The loss of this ball is going to
affect the outcome of this game.

1644
01:31:19,724 --> 01:31:22,977


1645
01:31:24,604 --> 01:31:27,524
Ow ! Hey !

1646
01:31:27,607 --> 01:31:30,443
Come on, kids !
Thomas, where are you going ?

1647
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:33,446
It's just one shot. You can do it !
We can win this thing !

1648
01:31:33,488 --> 01:31:37,492
- Come on, Coop ! You can do it.
- Coop !

1649
01:31:37,575 --> 01:31:39,494
Stop ! Don't shoot !

1650
01:31:39,577 --> 01:31:41,538
- Wait !
- Joey !

1651
01:31:41,663 --> 01:31:44,332
Here.
I brought this for you.

1652
01:31:44,416 --> 01:31:48,128
I made it myself.
Just like you.

1653
01:31:48,211 --> 01:31:50,171
Dude, you made this ?

1654
01:31:50,213 --> 01:31:52,757
Well, Miss Reed helped me
for most of it.

1655
01:31:52,841 --> 01:31:58,263
- But I finished it myself.
- Joey, this is great.

1656
01:31:58,346 --> 01:32:01,933
Coop, you know what
Miss Reed told me tonight ?

1657
01:32:02,016 --> 01:32:06,771
She said she wants me
to be a big sports star.

1658
01:32:08,022 --> 01:32:10,024
Just like Joe Cooper.

1659
01:32:21,244 --> 01:32:24,205
-Thanks, Dude.

1660
01:32:24,247 --> 01:32:27,125
Go get 'em, Coop !

1661
01:32:30,962 --> 01:32:32,881
Hey, Coop !

1662
01:32:32,964 --> 01:32:35,967
When's the last time you made
a home run without La-Z-Boy ?

1663
01:32:48,813 --> 01:32:52,275
 Al, we have seen some classic
Denslow Cup battles in the past,

1664
01:32:52,358 --> 01:32:55,028
but I can't remember one
that ever rivaled...

1665
01:32:55,111 --> 01:32:59,073
the drama and excitement
of this one.

1666
01:33:07,499 --> 01:33:10,043
It's off the rim !

1667
01:33:10,126 --> 01:33:12,378
Could be a double play.
Darcy tips.

1668
01:33:13,922 --> 01:33:16,341
Jantzen's try--
No.

1669
01:33:19,469 --> 01:33:22,722
Beers have a shot at the conversion.
Remer keeps it alive !

1670
01:33:25,350 --> 01:33:27,852
Last chance.

1671
01:33:33,650 --> 01:33:35,860
Coop up.

1672
01:33:44,786 --> 01:33:47,205
It's...

1673
01:33:47,288 --> 01:33:49,457
good !

1674
01:34:08,476 --> 01:34:11,396


1675
01:34:26,703 --> 01:34:28,663
Bob, in all my years
of calling games,

1676
01:34:28,705 --> 01:34:30,665
I don't think I've ever
been this excited !

1677
01:34:30,707 --> 01:34:33,251
You're excited ?
Feel these nipples !

1678
01:34:39,841 --> 01:34:43,261
Update: We still have no fucking clue
where this guy is.

1679
01:34:45,305 --> 01:34:51,352
 I can wear anything
and I can be anything

1680
01:34:51,436 --> 01:34:57,817
 Tonight I don't wanna
feel wonderful

1681
01:34:58,943 --> 01:35:05,658
 Tonight I don't wanna
feel bad

1682
01:35:05,742 --> 01:35:10,330
 'Cause tonight will be
the night of my dreams

1683
01:35:10,371 --> 01:35:13,166
 Tonight I don't wanna
feel anything

1684
01:35:21,758 --> 01:35:28,306
 And then things moved in
took no time at all

1685
01:35:28,389 --> 01:35:34,437
 Tonight I don't wanna
feel wonderful

1686
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:36,439
-Hey, ho !

1687
01:35:36,522 --> 01:35:39,192
Hey ! Ho !

1688
01:35:39,275 --> 01:35:41,235
All right.

1689
01:35:42,487 --> 01:35:44,864
Coop, what ?

1690
01:35:44,906 --> 01:35:47,825
- What is it ?
- It's Reggie.

1691
01:35:51,412 --> 01:35:53,331
Reggie Jackson.

1692
01:35:57,085 --> 01:36:01,047
Well, go.
Go ahead.

1693
01:36:09,430 --> 01:36:13,059
- Reggie.
- Coop. Nice goin' out there.

1694
01:36:13,142 --> 01:36:16,104
Thanks, man.
But you know, I gotta tell you.

1695
01:36:16,145 --> 01:36:19,691
- It's 'cause of you that I'm here.
- That's nice to know.

1696
01:36:19,774 --> 01:36:23,945
I brought this for you. I saw some kid
try to leave the ballpark with it.

1697
01:36:24,028 --> 01:36:28,032
You gotta hang on to that.
I got the two home run balls
I hit in the World Series.

1698
01:36:29,325 --> 01:36:31,285
Some wretched little shit
got the third one.

1699
01:36:33,162 --> 01:36:36,040
That sucks, dude.

1700
01:36:36,124 --> 01:36:38,418
I gotta get my trophy.
Maybe we can have a hot dog sometime ?

1701
01:36:38,459 --> 01:36:40,962
All right, sounds good.
Hey, Coop !

1702
01:36:41,045 --> 01:36:43,756
I don't have
your fuckin' ball !

1703
01:36:45,842 --> 01:36:48,219
Good luck next year.

1704
01:36:48,302 --> 01:36:51,097
Oh. Thanks.

1705
01:36:52,140 --> 01:36:54,225
Hey, Baxter !

1706
01:36:54,308 --> 01:36:56,477
Got milk ?

1707
01:36:56,561 --> 01:37:00,898
- Oh, I'm sorry !
-

1708
01:37:00,982 --> 01:37:04,110
And so, on behalf of
the National BASEketball League,

1709
01:37:04,152 --> 01:37:07,488
we'd like to present to the Beers
this year's Denslow Cup.

1710
01:37:07,572 --> 01:37:09,657
Congratulations !

1711
01:37:09,741 --> 01:37:11,659
Go ahead,
take your victory lap.

1712
01:37:11,743 --> 01:37:13,786
As they skate off,

1713
01:37:13,870 --> 01:37:17,749
all you can think about is
a team that conquered adversity,
a team that overcame the odds,

1714
01:37:17,832 --> 01:37:20,585
a team that defied
the critics,

1715
01:37:20,668 --> 01:37:23,588
a team that blah, blah, blah,
blah, a team that, uh-

1716
01:37:23,671 --> 01:37:28,301
 And so,
the ideal of sports once again
blossomed from a tiny seed,

1717
01:37:28,342 --> 01:37:32,555
nurtured, as always,
by the dreams of the young.

1718
01:37:32,638 --> 01:37:37,185
Yeah !
I'm the King of the World ! Yeah !

1719
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:50,448
 You've been psyched out
and you're goin' down

1720
01:37:50,531 --> 01:37:53,701
 I'm the trash-talkin'
talented, no-class clown

1721
01:37:53,743 --> 01:37:56,537
 I will abuse you
until you lose

1722
01:37:56,579 --> 01:38:00,917
 You can go on home and pout
You've been psyched out

1723
01:38:05,963 --> 01:38:08,633
 You talked to 20 men
Your shoe's untied

1724
01:38:08,716 --> 01:38:10,051
 And your mama
never loved you

1725
01:38:10,093 --> 01:38:11,969
 Mama never loved you

1726
01:38:12,053 --> 01:38:14,388
 She said she did
but she's ugly and she lies

1727
01:38:14,430 --> 01:38:17,642
 She's never thinkin' of you
Mama doesn't love you

1728
01:38:17,725 --> 01:38:20,770
 You ain't cut
from the right cloth

1729
01:38:20,853 --> 01:38:24,065
 You don't got
what it takes

1730
01:38:24,107 --> 01:38:27,652
 Now you blew it
Oh, another stupid mistake

1731
01:38:27,735 --> 01:38:29,112
 Another bad, bad break

1732
01:38:29,153 --> 01:38:32,281
 You been psyched out
and you're goin' down

1733
01:38:32,365 --> 01:38:35,451
 I'm a trash-talkin'
talented, no-class clown

1734
01:38:35,535 --> 01:38:38,246
 I will abuse you
until you lose

1735
01:38:38,287 --> 01:38:43,751
 You can go on home and pout
You've been psyched out

1736
01:38:43,793 --> 01:38:45,753
 Oh, yeah

1737
01:38:50,007 --> 01:38:54,929

 Doorways
open up and close

1739
01:39:06,399 --> 01:39:10,611
 More ways
to a punch line

1740
01:39:10,653 --> 01:39:14,907
 They're all laughin'
at your clothes

1743
01:39:19,829 --> 01:39:21,998
 First you're up
then you're down

1744
01:39:22,081 --> 01:39:26,627
 It's a cycle I've found
It always comes around

1745
01:39:26,669 --> 01:39:32,341
 But I will
still be laughin'

1746

 Yes, I will

01:39:44,228 --> 01:39:48,316
 Air raids in the afternoon

01:39:48,399 --> 01:39:52,403
 The children are playin'

Colored red balloons

 No one hears you prayin'

1751
01:39:59,660 --> 01:40:04,040
 And it comes back to you
all the things that you do

1752
01:40:04,081 --> 01:40:08,711
 They'll come lookin' for you

 Always leave you lyin'

 Face down
in a stranger's tomb

 Didn't know
you were dyin'

1759

 And you wait
for the call

Dude.
