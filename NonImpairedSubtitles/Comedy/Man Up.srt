Dom, it is like your single years have
been completely wiped from your memory.

I mean, do you remember
that one girl who just cried?

162
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:58,247
She cried all the way through giving you
a blow job. She was weeping.

<i>(chuckles) So sad.</i>

165
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,569
And look at you now.

166
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:11,008
And look at you both.
Yeah, really special.

- Come on, give him a chance.
- Yeah, I will. Bring it on.

You know, like me, another sad
single loser in their mid-30s, right?

169
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,090
No. I'm actually a sad single loser
in my late 30s.

170
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,161
Hey!

- Right.
- It's mojito.

179

I mean, I didn't think it was wee.

180
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,521
Why would it be wee? That would imply
very poor personal hygiene.

- Well, that's a relief.
- Hm.

but I need it for my date.

- It's how we'll recognise each other.

something and you'd say something back.

00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,249
I'd go quality and quantity, Bert.
It's a massive night.

You're right. We bloody deserve it.

00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,443
Let's go mental.

308
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:07,007
Seriously, you do deserve it.
I don't know how you've done it.

309
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:10,402
Not that I don't intend to go
the whole distance myself, obviously.

310
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,842
I think the trick is, get through
the first 30, 40 years,

311
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,720
then just kind of give up.
From that point on it's a breeze.

312
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,802
- No, I mean it.
- How are we getting on?

313
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,087
- We are nailing it.
- That's great.

314
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,640
You can put about
half those lagers back, Adam.

315
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,882
What does Nancy want to drink?

316
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,281
- I'm not sure if...
- (Bert) She wants vodka.

317
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,443
The only spirit she can out-drink me on.
We'll see about that later.

318
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,721
No, we won't.

319
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,327
Guys, she didn't even answer the phone.
Some man did. I think she's on a date.

320
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,971
The man from last night?
I thought that didn't work out.

321
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,849
It didn't. It was a disaster.

322
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,810
- He was in love with his sister.
- Who answered the phone, then?

323
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,406
Dad, I don't know.
He said he wasn't a psychopath.

324
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,568
Well, that sounds encouraging.

325
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,167
We're having a party. She's on a date.
I'm thinking she's gonna bring him.

326
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,322
- Bert!
- If he's not a psychopath.

327
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,290
Did he sound like a wine drinker
or more of a beer man?

328
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,441
<i>(mother) Bert!</i>

329
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,040
- I'm just getting some more wine.
- Course you are.

330
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,726
The good host is prepared
for all eventualities.

331
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,768
Come on, Pattersons, clock's ticking.

332
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,161
Fran, you walk straight past that offer.

333
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,721
So, what's going on? ls Nancy OK?

334
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,804
Yes. Yes, Mum, she's fine. She's just...

335
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,121
- He's looking forward to her speech.
- I know.

336
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,044
- So she is coming?
- Yes, of course she's coming.

337
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,363
Look, do you want me to write
a few words? You know, just in case.

338
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,088
Not really, darling, no.

339
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,243
Oh, God. That is horrible.

340
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,765
I'm sorry.

341
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,049
- I'll give her a call, then.
- Yes, please do, darling.

342
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,210
(Nancy's date) Ah...

343
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,881
<i>(he breathes deeply)</i>

344
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,687
- You OK? You seem a bit freaked out.
- Do I?

345
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,886
- Yeah.
- <i>(phone rings)</i>

346
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,089
Gosh. Sorry, just bit of
a first-date no-no...

347
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,811
- (phone rings)
- Oh, my God, that's embarrassing.

348
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,008
- Oh, it's Tom.
- Oh.

349
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,241
Hey,buddy.

350
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,566
Yeah, I'm here. I'm with Jessica.

351
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,768
Yeah, we're on the South Bank.

352
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,366
Yeah, d'you wanna speak to her?
Alright.

353
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,411
We will.

354
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,129
Yeah. OK, Tom.
Yeah, I'm gonna hang up now.

355
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,884
Yeah, OK. Bye. Bye.

356
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,725
- He thought we hadn't met up.
- As if.

357
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,043
- Shall we switch these things off?
- Yeah. OK, good.

358
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,445
Right. So, Jessica.

359
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,800
So...

360
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,805
- Tom says that you work in the City.
- I do, yeah. That's what I do.

361
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,611
- Is that a stressful job?
- Ah, no.

362
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,001
- "Lunch is for wimps."
- <i>(both</i> laugh)

363
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,081
Sorry.

364
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,208
- No, no, it's from Wall Street.
- Yeah.

365
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,443
"If you need a friend, get a dog."
I love that movie.

366
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,006
- You do?
- Yeah, it's one of my favourites.

367
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,323
- And you are a...?
- I'm an online marketing manager.

368
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,529
I love online marketing managing.

369
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,246
What I really wanna do is paint.

370
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,891
I don't wanna be an online
marketing manager forever

371
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,203
because, you know,
the bots are taking over!

372
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,727
They're gonna be managing
all the marketing in the future.

373
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:23,124
- It's like "help".
- Exactly, yeah. Erm...

374
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,248
- I'm a bit nervous, to be honest.
- Really?

375
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:30,451
Yeah. A little bit. Just a little bit.
I'm not used to all this dating chat.

376
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:34,804
Although, you know, I had a few
reservations about today,

377
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,770
but I just thought,
"You know what, Jack? I trust Tom."

378
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,890
He's not gonna set me up with somebody
who I've nothing in common with.

379
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,041
- And he's a good friend, right?
- Who, Tom?

380
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,043
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I'd take a bullet for him.

381
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,567
Yeah. So, shall we
get a beer or something?

382
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,450
- There's one of those pop-up bars.
- Sure, that'll be great.

383
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,245
They appear out of nowhere,
then they're gone the next day.

384
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,881
This can't be our favourite place
because it'll be gone in the morning.

385
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,043
- Can we get two Red Stripes?
- That'd be great.

386
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,724
- So...
- So...

387
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,883
Where are you on the old, you know,
the relationship...

388
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,689
the spectrum of relationships?

389
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,049
- It's my mime for relationships.
- That's good. Right.

390
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,851
Well, I guess long-term-wise it's...

391
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,843
It's been a while.

392
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,605
- Since Pete, right?
- Since Pete.

393
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,125
Tom told me. Massive cock.

394
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,247
- Really?
- Huge.

395
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,243
- It wasn't that big...
- What he did to you.

396
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,606
- ...a deal.
- Unforgivable.

397
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,921
I know how it feels.
I had it done to me, you know.

398
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,571
- Affairs, eh? Who'd have them?
- Yeah...

399
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,880
- They would.
- They would.

400
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,440
The other people would.

401
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,291
So where are you on the... spectrum?

402
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,046
On the spectrum? I think recently,
I've had a few one-night stands.

403
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,647
You know, just girls I've met at work

404
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,405
and in bars and just, like,
on the street.

405
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:56,041
But this is my first real date really
since the D-word.

406
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,081
- Dead sister?
- Sorry?

407
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,970
Just something I say before I drink.
Dead sister.

408
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,166
Dead sister.

409
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,722
But I'm not gonna let a failed marriage
put me off relationships for good.

410
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,211
Divorce.

411
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,931
You be thankful that
you and Pete didn't get hitched.

412
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,766
It gets a lot more complicated when you
have to figure out who gets the flat.

413
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,285
Winner.

414
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,242
- I did.
- Yeah.

415
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,761
I got big home-improvement plans.
I'm gonna do up our... my flat.

416
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,922
Paint the hallways, bleach the sheets.

417
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,049
Anyway, let's not talk about that.
It's just bad juju.

418
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,407
- And I'm so over it.
- You really sound it.

419
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,081
It's <i>in</i> the past. What does <i>it</i> say
<i>in</i> Six Billion People and You?

420
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,891
- F... Fuck the past.
- Fuck the past, yeah.

421
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,964
If that book has taught me anything,
it's taught me that.

422
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,407
So, Tom says you're a triathlete.

423
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,121
- Hm-hmm.
- Do you have to train a lot for that?

424
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,931
Yeah, I've just got
to regularly carb up.

425
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,331
Ah! Yeah, yeah.

426
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,529
Go on then. I don't mind.
I've actually worked out today...

427
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,571
I work out every day.
I like to keep fit. I pump iron, sure.

428
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,360
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

429
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,286
This is nice, isn't it? I don't envy
any of my friends with kids.

430
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,806
Are they here now? Hell, no.

431
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,327
They're at home lying in wait
for the next nappy change.

432
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,686
Not that I don't want kids.

433
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:16,048
I'm 40. They're not gonna be swimming
in the right direction forever.

434
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,966
But just not right now. I should
probably get a girlfriend first.

435
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:24,728
I definitely want kids. I'm just not
freaking out about it yet.

436
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,406
I mean, why would you? You're 24.

437
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,807
D'you wanna get out of here?
It is fucking freezing

438
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,202
and I know a really fun place
just over the river.

439
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:40,285
We can get shots and maybe hang out
a bit more if you feel like it.

440
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,764
- Yeah, I'd love that.
- OK.

441
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,047
- (Jack) This is gonna be fun.
- (Nancy) Yeah. What is it?

442
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,884
(Jack) It's like a cantina.

443
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,804
It's a bit cheesy
but you can have slammers and...

444
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,529
<i>oh, wow. Arriba!</i>

445
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,210
- Hey, man.
- How's it going?

446
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:08,526
- Are you a regular here?
- Well, define "regular". What is it?

447
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,887
- Hi, Jack.
- Hey, Helen, how's it going?

448
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,007
Oh, so you...

449
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,241
Ah! Snap.

450
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,163
- We're swapping, right?
- Swapping?

451
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,926
For the genius Six Billion Ways to get
to know you list that you suggested.

452
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,571
Is that your one?
Mine's at the front. OK...

453
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,211
<i>- (she clears her throat)
-</i> Hm...

454
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,931
Let's have a look, shall we?
OK, then.

455
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,368
Shall I read yours first?
"Put yourself out there."

456
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,251
"Take chances."

457
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,290
- "Black pant wash."
- It's a band.

458
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,207
- Are they new?
- Yeah, they're new.

459
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,727
They're... They're fresh. Very young.
They're my favourite band.

460
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,451
Oh, yeah, of course.
Yeah, they're very, er, funky.

461
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,561
"Get stronger thighs."

462
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:53,201
Hey, this is spooky.
I also love spaghetti bolognese.

463
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,009
What are the chances of that?

464
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,402
- Like none chances.
- I know. That's the lists done.

465
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,090
- Yeah!
- And didn't they go well?

466
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,924
- Really great.
- That was...

467
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,731
- (Nancy) Look, let me get this.
- No, I should get it.

468
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,167
- Please, let me.
- OK. I'll get the next ones.

469
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,005
- Oh, my God. Who are they?
- Who, what?

470
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,290
- These guys.
- Oh, this is Slash and Axl.

471
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,691
Oh.

472
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,285
Paradise Kitties.

473
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,248
- I blew it, sorry. That was no good.
- Er...

474
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,369
Jack. I've got a confession to make
and I'm just gonna...

475
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,522
- So have I.
- "come out with it. You have?

476
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,968
- I have, yeah. Let me go first. I...
- OK.

477
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,883
I've never heard of Black Pant Wash.

478
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:41,401
I'm sorry. I wanna be honest with you,
because honesty is very important...

479
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,567
Yes, I agree.

480
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,042
These lists are great
and they're a brilliant ice-breaker,

481
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,761
but you don't really believe that
just because we both like spag bol,

482
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,650
we're gonna wind up together
forever, right?

483
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,167
- Depends on the spag bol.
- Might be a really good spag bol.

484
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,086
But right now, whatever happens tonight,
wherever we end up,

485
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,970
I'm having a really good time
getting to know you.

486
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:07,250
And you're being really patient with me,
so thank you for that.

487
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,243
And I don't know why I brought you here.

488
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,891
It was a stupid idea
and I think we should...

489
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,611
Let's do something different.
Let's go someplace else.

490
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:18,241
- Tom said you liked bowling.
- I love bowling.

491
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,767
OK, so shall we have a couple more
and then hit the lanes?

- Nancy?
- Yeah?

510
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,166
It's Nancy Patterson.

00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,848
I sat next to you in chemistry
for five years.

514
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,843
I gave you that Valentine's card
in Year 9.

515
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,763
You tore it up in front of everyone.

516
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:08,242
- Your mum ran me over that time.
- Oh, God. Yes, I do remember.

517
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,401
<i>- (he laughs)
- Shh.</i>

518
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,966
- Erm, sorry about that.
- Oh, God, don't worry.

519
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,850
Glued it back together.
It was only about 57 pieces.

520
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,967
I meant about the car.

521
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,168
- But you were so...
- Fat. Yes.

522
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,447
- Yeah.
- That was me, big fat Sean.

- Now you're very...
- Yeah, I went on the 5:2 diet.

525
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,043
Five days on chocolate Nesquik.
and two days strawberry Nesquik.

526
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:31,283
- Oh, OK.
- I lost it all from here and from here.

527
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,283
But luckily not from here.

528
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,409
- Could I just have two beers, please?
- Hell, yeah.

OK, cheers.

536
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:06,283
- Ah. Flirting with the barman, I see.
- What? No.

537
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,931
- Not at all, no.
- I was, like, "Whoa, competition."

538
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,651
No, I wasn't. I'm the least jealous
person you'll meet.

00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,210
Oh, God, me, too, yeah.

540
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,327
So,

541
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,243
let's ramp this up a bit.

542
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,845
Not that I'm competitive.

543
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,451
(Sean) Nancy.

544
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,083
Brought you some nachos. On the house.

545
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,527
- I've got a wheat allergy...
- No, you don't.

547
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,730
You remember this?

548
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,449
- What is it? Where'd you get that?
- In my wallet.

549
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,449
- Who took it?
- I did.

550
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,847
I don't remember you ever
being in my bedroom.

551
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:40,447
I wasn't in your bedroom, silly.
I was outside. In a tree.

552
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,166
- Jessica, watch and weep.
- (Nancy) OK.

553
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:47,370
Why is he calling you Jessica?
You're called Nancy.

554
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,330
- You're Nancy Patterson.
- I'm in a bit of a situation here.

555
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,085
(sniffs)
Oh, you still use Pantene Pro-V.

556
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:56,130
That guy is not my boyfriend.
He's actually not even my date.

557
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,124
I sort of stole him from
underneath the clock at Waterloo

558
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,329
and I'm pretending to be the girl
he's supposed to be on a date with.

559
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,687
- So it's a bit... I don't know.
- Kinky.

560
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,410
(Jack) Hey, there.

561
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,967
- How's it going? I'm Jack.
- And I am Sean.

562
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,963
- He's Sean.
- There it is.

563
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:15,601
- So you guys know each other?
- We just went to school together.

564
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:19,287
- Yeah, we're old friends.
- We're old, old friends.

565
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,170
We used to have a bit of a thing
going on.

566
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,844
- Good for you.
- It was.

567
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,604
It really wasn't that good.

568
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,330
You never forget your first.

569
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,687
Lovely to see you
after all these years.

570
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,684
- We'll take it from here.
- (Sean) Hang on, Jessica.

571

Hey. What are you doing?

572
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,891
It would appear that I finally have you
over a barrel, Nancy Patterson.

573
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,282
Indeed, you are clearly not the girl
you used to be once.

574
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:47,321
Cool and confident. Now, stealing other
women's dates from under clocks.

575
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,131
You're working as a barman
in a novelty bowling alley so...

576
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,567
- Just as Mr Armstrong predicted.
- Who's that?

577
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,928
Our careers advisor at Saint Andrew's.
Do you not remember anything?

578
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,322
- No.
- Because I remember everything. Nancy!

579
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:04,201
Sean, I'm out bowling with a man who...
might actually have some potential

580
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:07,523
and not in just that
he's a really good bowler-type way.

581
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,251
So don't ruin it for me. Just be cool.

582
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,129
- OK, I will.
- Yeah?

583
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,807
- Uh-huh. If you give me a blow job.
- You what?

584
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,649
- Take it or leave it.
- Are you out of your fucking mind?

585
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,769
Come on, wouldn't hurt.
Just a tiny little blow job.

586

588
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:32,731
- Not gonna give you a blow job, so...
- Hand job? Pearl necklace?

589
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,246
- Kiss? Please. Come on.
- Stop. Stop it. Stop it.

590
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,322
I just want to fulfill
a lifelong ambition.

591
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,131
OK, OK. I'll do one kiss. OK?

592
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,770
- With tongues?
- No tongues.

593
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,286
- Oh! But in the toilets.
- Yeah, in the toilets.

594
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,010
And it has to be tonight.

595
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,402
Otherwise I won't find you again
because you have no online presence.

596
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,726
- Can I go now?
- Yes.

597
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,451
- But I'll be watching you.
- I don't doubt that.

Oh, shit, shit, shit!

It's fine, they're fine.

600
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,243
Everyone'll just get drunk
and shove them down.

601
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,845
- They will.
- Yeah?

602
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,046

Not... Not exactly.

605
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,044
(Fran) Oh, no. No, no.

606
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:17,920
But in her defence, she does have
a very good reason for her tardiness.

607
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,128
And she's right, Fran.

608

And who knows, maybe today will end up
being not just our anniversary.

Oh, my God,

Oh, Bert, you've slobbed.

- What? Where?
- Christ. What is this now?

613
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,404
It's hummus.

614
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,921
Take it off. Off, off, off.

I feel... l just feel like...
I feel hustled.

620
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,524
Because I won?
Are you not used to that?

621
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,251
I'm not really used
to losing at bowling.

Oh, can't I keep them?

623

You think it's the first time
he's heard that?

624
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,607
They're cute. Well, maybe tonight.

625
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:09,209
Let's not forget this.
Keep you nice and warm.

626
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,040
- Are you saving that for later?
- What?

627
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,521
Got a bit of jalapeno in your teeth.

628
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:20,685
You've just got a little bit of spinach
or something jammed in.

629
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,888
No, it's still there. It's...

Oh, my God. It's a good one.

OK. No, it's not, though, is it?

632
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:31,042
- No, it's still wedged in.
- I'm just gonna nip to the ladies.

You'd been gone awhile

Don't be so harsh on Nancy.

669
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,327
Who's Nancy?
Why is he calling you Nancy?

670
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,847
- Why?
- It was my other pet name for her.

671
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,241
- After Nancy Reagan.
- Nancy Sinatra.

672
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,800
- I'm gonna go.
- OK, wait, hang on.

673
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:39,248
Wait, Jack, let me just tell you
the truth because...

674
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,448
now is as good a time as any
just to confess.

675
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,800
Confess what?

676
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,169
The reason Sean called me Nancy
was because I'm not called Jessica

677
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:50,926
and the reason I'm not called Jessica
is because I'm not actually Jessica.

678
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,884
She's Nancy. She's Nancy Patterson.
(laughs)

679
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,407
Thank you, Sean. Can you put your
clothes back on and leave? Please.

680
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,205
- What about my kiss?
- Out. No. Jog on. Out!

681
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,770
Anyway, look, I was in here with him

682
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:09,322
because he said he wouldn't tell you
who I really was if I kissed him.

683
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,607
The truth is,
I'm not really your blind date.

684
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,207
You thought I was, what with the book,
the clock and the quid pro quo.

685
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,921
So you're not the girl
that I was supposed to meet earlier?

686
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,570
- No.
- What?!

687
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,405
I know! It sounds a bit mad.
But don't think of it as mad.

688
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,887
Think of it as impulsive.

689
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,042
What kind of person
stands underneath a clock

690
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,566
- waiting to steal someone's date?
- I wasn't waiting.

691
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,291
It's not stealing
in the conventional sense of the word.

692
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,091
That girl gave me her book
so that's why you thought I was her.

693
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,771
No, I thought you were her
because you said you were.

694
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,569
Did I actually say that?

695
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,769
When were you thinking of telling me
about this bizarre decision?

696
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:47,561
- There wasn't actually a plan.
- I'm sure there wasn't a plan.

697
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,610
Because who would have a plan
for something so fucked up?

698
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:53,411
I think people have done
worse things in the world.

699
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,161
- I'm racking my brains.
- That girl wasn't even right for you.

700
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:01,086
We'll never know. I'll never meet her
because you stole her.

701
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:04,243
I was merely trying to meet my mate
in the modern world.

- I'm Nancy Patterson. Hello.

703
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,764
- Are you even a triathlete?
- That's the next thing you ask?

704
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,923
- And where's Jessica?
- Probably gone home by now.

705
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,844
- Past her bedtime.
- Are you even 24?

706
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,685
- Aw. Add another ten.
- What?

707
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,526
- Fuck you, Granddad.
- Not in six billion years.

708
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,887
- That was uncalled for.
- That was uncalled for?

709
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,849
- Yeah.

710

716
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,280
if you'd been set up
with someone perfect for you

717

and some psycho
pretends to be them instead?

718
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,609
- Setups never work.

She works in the City.
What does that even mean?

721
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,210
When people say that?

722
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:59,250
It means she is a high-flying
24-year-old businesswoman...

723
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,005
24. You love that word.
It's your favourite word.

724
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,764
Isn't that just the classic response

725
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:07,162
of the lonely 34-year-old woman
desperate for somewhere to put her eggs.

726
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,005
I'm nearly at my sexual peak.
It's all downhill for you.

727
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,287
Knock knock, who's there? Viagra!

It doesn't surprise me
that Pete slept around.

Hang on a sec. Oh, oh, oh!
There is no Pete!

And there is no wife
because she left you.

732
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,924
Here's your theory. You think,
"I'm so wounded and rejected."

733
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,561
"Please, help me, younger woman,
who's nearly half my age."

734
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:30,530
This is coming from someone
who had to steal someone else's date

735
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,647
to even get one.

736
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,849
At least I'm not walking around
like I'm bloody catch of the century.

737
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,367
Look at me with my own flat
and my online marketing management job.

738
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,250
But what I really want to do is paint.

Thank you very much, it was lovely
not getting to know you

Oh, f... Oh, my God,
we've left my bag at the cantina.

746

Your bag, not mine.
How many tequilas have you had?

747

- Ooh, sexy.

748

- I came from the lawyers, alright?
- Sexier.

749

Your divorce papers...

It's my folks' 40th wedding anniversary
tonight.

752
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,806
It just gets better. Not only do you
steal somebody else's blind date,

753
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:23,441
you stand up your parents on one of the
most important milestones of their life.

754
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:27,042
You really, really need to consider
your motivations for doing things

755
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,884
and not doing things.

756
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,122
- I'm gonna get my speech.
- Whatever. Taxi!

757
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,602
- What are you doing?
- Calling a cab so I can go to the bar.

758
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,967
- It's a ten-minute walk.
- No, it's 20 minutes.

759
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:40,442
- It's ten minutes!
- You seem awfully confident, Nancy.

760
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,449
- Because it's a fact, Jack.
- It's a fact.

761
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,040
Is it a fact?
Like the fact that you're a triathlete.

762
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,088
- Great.
- Here's a good idea.

763
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:50,881
Why don't you run, swim and cycle to the
bar and we'll see who gets there first?

764
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,531
- What?
- You don't know what a triathlon is.

765
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,011
- Yes, I do.
- You do, do you?

00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:14,002
It's a fact. I'm just saying.
I'm not lying.

906
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:16,048
- It's been a year.
- It's OK, Hil.

907
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:19,090
It's not the first time
I've heard that one.

908
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:22,004
- First time I've heard it.
- I'm unaffected by it, so...

909
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:26,608
And it's been more than a year,
actually, Hilary. It's been 368 days.

910
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:30,082
Not that I'm crossing it off on
my wall calendar of pain and deceit.

911
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,571
I need a piss.

912
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:34,169
Oh, fuck! Shit.

913
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,883
- Oh, shit.
- Hey...

914
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:44,402
Hey, don't worry, Baby Cakes. This was
bound to happen sooner or later.

915
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:48,323
He does this. It's kind of blackmail.

916
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,328
He's a very emotional man.

917
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,970
We're gonna need more nibbles, please.
So...

918
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:58,846
"question.

919
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,768
- You two had an affair?
- We fell in love.

920
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,763
Yeah, but you had an affair?

921
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:09,325
- The marriage was over anyway.
- But you had an affair?

922
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:15,245
- Yeah.
- I guess he is just an emotional man.

923
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,884
Look, I'm sorry, Hilary.

924
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,850
- The truth is...
- I missed you, Big Nuts.

925
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,160
<i>(kisses I laughs)</i>

926
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:27,086
So what rating
are you two rabbits on now?

927
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:30,130
- Rating?
- Yeah, sexually speaking?

928
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:33,204
Because Jack and I, God,
we're still in porno land really.

929
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,884
- (chokes)
- (Hilary) Porno land?

930
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,531
- Hm-hmm. Shall I explain?
- Please do.

931
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:40,649
OK. You know when a woman
first starts sleeping with a man,

932
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,051
she acts like a porn star.

933
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:44,009
Am I right? Jack and I, anything goes.

934
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:47,527
Church of Lesbyterian, dinner beneath
the bridge, guided tour of site B,

935
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,170
if you know where that is. He knows.

936
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:52,528
Remember when you said we should
and I was like, "I'm not gonna do that."

937
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,284
- You said, "Go on, try it."
- Did I?

938
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:58,160
And I was just thinking, "I'm actually
quite scared," because I couldn't see.

939
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,766
Then, God, you flipped it.
And all of a sudden...

940
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:03,571
God, I felt like, "Please don't stop."

941
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:07,645
"Jack, please don't stop. Don't stop,
Jack. Do what you do, Jack."

942
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:09,961
"Thank you, Jack.
I love your work, Jack."

943
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:13,965
And you lot are like, "Wow, our sex life
is always gonna be like a porn film."

944
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:17,362
Six months in, the ladies,
we drop it down to an 18,

945
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,001
and then a 15, maybe a quick 69
but only if we've just had a bath.

946
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:25,927
And then suddenly, whoa, we're a PG-13
wearing tartan pyjamas to bed

947
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,641
doing the goodnight rollover before
you can say "missionary position".

948
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,728
That is a brilliant theory.

949
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:37,407
Thank you. But do you know what, Jack?
I really feel

950
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:41,570
like we're gonna be in porno land
for a lot longer than usual.

951
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,451
- I have a theory, too.
- Yeah? What is it?

952
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:49,087
If you get a woman back to your place
and you say you don't wanna have sex,

953
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:53,882
you just wanna take it slowly,
I guarantee she will go down on you.

954
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,849
- The Blow Job Paradox.
- Blow Job Paradox!

955
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:01,083
- Yeah! "Use it, don't abuse it."
- If divorce papers were honest,

956
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,561
they wouldn't say
"irreconcilable differences".

957
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:06,325
- They'd say "not enough blow jobs".
- Not enough blowjobs!

958
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,528
Like, get down there, fix it.

959
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:12,446
Sorry to interrupt. Did you
get a chance to sign those papers?

960
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:19,367
Yes, I did, actually, Hilary. In fact,
coincidentally, I have them with me.

961
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:23,161
Although, stupid Jack,
I signed them with a pen.

962
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:26,210
You'd probably prefer it
if I did it with my own blood.

963
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:32,324
Hey, this is our song. We should dance.
It's very special. Isn't that mad?

964
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:35,327
Don't fucking touch me.

965
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:36,890
- Yay.
- What are you doing?

966
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,962
Stopping you from making
a twat of yourself

967
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,008
by using the medium of dance. Hello.

968
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:43,765
I'm gonna slow-dance you
into submission, OK?

969
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:47,367
You'll need to put your arms around
my waist for it to work properly. Good.

970
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,125
- I'm such a dick.
- You're not. You're not a dick.

971
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,044
It's always better
to be the one that's dumped.

972
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:55,646
You never regret anything.
She made the decision.

973
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:58,007
She's gotta live with that
for the rest of her life.

974
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:01,562
- It's not as simple as that, is it?
- But it will be. it just takes time.

975
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:05,440
- Your hands are slipping down my arse.
- Sorry. Old habit.

976
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:09,170
Everybody knew they were doing it.
Nobody told me.

977
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:11,129
It's rough. I'll admit it's rough.

978
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,690
I was really traditional about

979
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,525
the whole "don't sleep around
when you're married" thing.

980
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,602
Hands-arse. That's right.

I bet you proposed
on the top of a Tuscan hill.

00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,210
Cephalonian, actually.

983
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:24,089
Spent a year planning your big day.

984
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,924
- Twenty grand, all in?
- Bit more.

985
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,367
- Let's not forget the ring.
- It was four grand.

986
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:31,284
And we had to get it resized
because she got awfully thin.

987
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:34,842
You spent £24,000
on a party and some jewellery?

988
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,001
It was a grand gesture.

989
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,811
What's the point of life
if you're not up for stuff like that?

990
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:42,566
A grand gesture that amounted
to nothing. Hands-arse.

991
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:46,162
- God, you're such a fucking cynic.
- And you're such a fucking romantic.

and I'm...

1051
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,765
...I’m just holding on.
- OK.

1052
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:41,602
A, I wouldn't say "happy", exactly.

1053
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:45,844
And secondly, I mean,
you're not holding on to her.

1054
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,843
You're holding on to a feeling

1055
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:51,561
and that feeling will eventually pass.
Promise.

1056
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:54,850
I mean, look, maybe I was wrong.

1057
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:59,642
Maybe dating 24-year-olds
is exactly what you need right now.

1058
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:02,530
- You've changed your tune.
- Well, unlike...

1059
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:07,131
...the older lady,
they do have less baggage.

1060
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:12,281
I mean, shit, I'm way over
my baggage allowance.

1061
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:15,125
I'm four years single.
Four fucking years.

1062
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:21,201
Prior to that, I had six years
with the supposed love of my life,

1063
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:24,124
when, out of the blue,
he ended it and then he...

1064
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:28,044
He said he wanted to go to China
to find himself.

1065
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:30,600
Then he found himself
shacked up in Shepherd's Bush

1066
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:32,648
with some other girl six months later.

1067
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:35,724
- I'm over it, obviously, but I just...
- Yeah, you really sound it.

1068
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:39,725
Apart from one thing.

1069
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:43,566
One thing that, honestly,
I'm not sure that I can ever get over.

1070
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:44,880
(Jack) What?

1071
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,200
He...

1072
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:50,087
He de-authorised me from his iTunes.

00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:57,320
It is. It is, actually.

1076
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:02,045
So, what do you really do for a living?

1077
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,361
I'm a journalist. Yeah.

1078
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:08,569
Slash wannabe literary polymath.

1079
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:12,167
- That figures. You got good theories.
- Oh, you like them now?

1080
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:13,844
I wouldn't listen to me, though,

1081
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:17,766
because I'm not exactly the poster child
for the dating industry.

1082
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:20,969
Really? I'm 40, divorced
and crying in a toilet.

1083
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,644
You're just...

1084
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:28,247
You're an emotional jigsaw at the moment

1085
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:30,846
but you're gonna piece yourself
back together.

1086
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:34,163
You know, start with the corners.
Look for the blue bits.

1087
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:40,850
And where do I find these "blue bits"?

1088
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:48,002
(man) Took me three years
to get over my ex.

1089
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:53,120
Jungian therapy.
Two hours every day. Six weeks.

1090
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:56,363
I burnt her clothes. Twice.

1091
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:58,920
I'm not saying
that her porn star theory is correct.

1092
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,525
But you did blow job paradox me?

1093
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:03,524
Hey. Where did you two get to?

1094
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,921
Probably 69-ing in the toilets,
no doubt.

1095
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,765
Who's up for a shot?
Let's do some shots.

1096
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:12,003
- I think I've had enough to drink.
- We're just gonna head off.

1097
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:15,004
Nonsense. It's a seminal night
so we should mark it somehow.

1099
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:19,201
You look like you've been crying.

1100
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:21,726
- Actually, I was crying.
- With laughter.

1101
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:24,246
Have you ever tried to do it
in a cubicle that small?

I think I left my knickers in there.

She does not need to know
the real reason for your tears.

leave your knickers in there?

- Jessica.

1135
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:01,770
She said she spoke to Tom
and there's obviously been

1136
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:04,650
some sort of misunderstanding
and she still wants to meet up.

Even though you stood her up?

Technically, you stood her up, actually.

She's young so she's not
a total cynic like you. Us. Yet.

You said I should keep it simple.

- When?
- Like, half an hour ago in the toilet.

So, what is your theory on this one?

- My theory?
- Yeah, I wanna hear it. What's the...

ls it "boy meets girl"
or "boy doesn't meet girl"?

(chuckles) I mean...

1147
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:39,331
This is when you tell me what to do
and then we argue and then...

1148
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:42,529
You know, it's a bit of back and forth
and eventually...

all these theories and opinions

my permission or something?

- No, not at all.
- Then I think you should meet Jessica.

- Yeah, but that's not...
- What are you waiting for, right?

What am l...? I don't know
what I'm waiting for.

- OK.
- That's where the...

1160

You can give her this back then.

1161

- No, she bought another one.
- Course she did.

- Yeah.

So sorry for derailing your date.

1167
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:39,367
I'm glad you did, otherwise I'd have
nothing to talk about on the next one.

1168
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,569
It is a good anecdote.
I'll probably use it in future myself.

1169
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:45,120
So, well, look after yourself...

1170
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:48,010

- OK, and...

01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:21,162
would have been here to do the speech.

1202
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:24,642
But, er, she's been a little delayed.

1203
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:29,767
So it falls to myself...

1204
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:34,207
...to find a few choice words.

01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:43,682
...what's left for us to say
to each other after 40 years?

1208
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:45,842
Take the fucking recycling out.

another 40 years ahead of us...

1214

- Bloody hope not.
- (laughter)

1215
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:03,722
...or we will ever agree...

1216
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:07,808
...that you can park on
a double yellow line on a Sunday...

- But you can, actually.
- (Fran) Whose side are you on?

...or she will ever fully trust me
with the big weekly shop...

1219

Not a hope in hell.

1220

No, I don't dabble.

I was late to meet you.

1254

But, actually, the reason
that I had to buy another copy

1255
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:57,889
was because I left my copy
for this woman on the train

1256
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:02,249
and she so needed to read it.
She was a very unhappy soul.

You know, one of those sort of "lost
hope", "clock ticking" kind of women.

and she was wrong. Taxi!

To win her heart.

your attention, please.

a few words. Er...

1371
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:04,691
Er, I actually had
something prepared but...

1372
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:07,331
I lost it. It's kind of a long story...

1373
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:09,289
Actually, I'm just gonna tell you,

1374
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:11,408
cos it's actually the reason
I was so late

1375
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:14,046
and the reason why this speech

1376

<i>(laughter)</i>

1377
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:17,885
I met a man today.

1378
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:20,770
- Hello.
- (Nancy) No, not this man.

1379
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:23,684
I was standing underneath
the clock at Waterloo Station

1380
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:25,762
when a man called Jack

1381
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:28,605
mistook me for his blind date

1382
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:30,603
and instead of just saying,

1383
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:34,924
"Hey, you got the wrong girl,"
like a normal person, erm...

1384
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:40,125
...l thought it was a good idea
to just pretend that I was his date.

1385
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:42,123
<i>(gasps) No, you didn't?</i>

1386
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:45,522
- I did. I did. But, but...
- (laughter)

1387
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:50,003
You know, we went out and, you know,
for the first time in ages,

1388
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:53,289
I put myself out there,
and I took a chance,

1389
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:54,930
and I even got stronger thighs.

1390
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:59,725
Then Jack found out
I wasn't who I said I was,

1391
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:02,246
a 24-year-old triathlete by the way.

1392

<i>- 24?</i>
<i>(Nancy) Yeah.</i>

1393
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:06,770
And so he went to go
and meet his real blind date.

1394
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:08,888
So blah, blah, blah, the end.

<i>(all groan)</i>

1396

1397
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:22,241
I'm a bit sad. (sighs)

And, you know,
no, it didn't work out, but...

1400
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:34,561
I got a hint of what
could be out there for me.

1401
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:36,005
You know...

1402
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,604
...a fun...

1403
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:43,321

long, happy life with someone.

1405
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:47,929
Something that these two have had

1406
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,527
since they first laid eyes on each other
40 years ago.

1407
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:53,090
So, please...

1408
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:59,851

wishing them a very happy anniversary.

and members of Nancy's family

1434
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:23,201
who I've never met before in my life.
This is...

1435
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:27,649
I met a girl today, the wrong girl,

1436
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:30,530
except she turned out
to be the right girl.

1437
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:33,080
And this girl who took a chance on me

1438
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:36,323
in the most bizarre
and romantic way possible

1439
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:39,449
wanted me to take a chance on her,
but, erm...

1440
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:43,363
...l didn't, you know. I didn't.
I blew it,

1441
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:47,809
like a stupid 40-year-old,
mid-life-crisis dickhead that I am.

1442
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:52,327
Which is why I sought help
from old beaus.

1443
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:56,371
Yes, you... not the most reliable
of sources, really. Whatever.

1444
01:19:56,440 --> 01:20:00,525
But undeterred, I commandeered
these brilliant young drunks,

1445
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:03,763
because nothing was gonna stop me
from finding this girl

1446
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:06,844
and telling her what
I should have told her earlier on.

1447
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:13,569
Nancy, I am so bloody glad
you pretended to be my date today,

1448
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:15,244
because, if you hadn't,

1449
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:20,008
then I never would've heard
any of your amazing sex theories

1450
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:24,881
or... watched you trying to get
jalapeno out of your teeth

1451
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:29,204
or witnessed your very instinctive
firewoman skills.

1452
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:35,003
I would never have got to know
that muddy, beautiful triathlete face

1453
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:38,926
or witnessed that awesome,
highly competitive arse

1454
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,048
as you were about to get another strike.

1455
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:44,602
In fact, if you hadn't have
pretended to be my date today,

1456
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:47,411
my day would have been utterly rubbish.
