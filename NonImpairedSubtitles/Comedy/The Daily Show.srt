My name is jon stewart.

00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:37,103
We have put together a program

15
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:37,837
For you tonight that will defy

All other programs.

17

Tonight's guest, the great, the

Great albert brooks.

[cheers and applause]

20
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:48,214
Hey, remember like a week ago,

21
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:49,949
The president released his birth

22
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,183
Certificate and celebrated his

23
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:52,184
Newfound citizenship by having

24
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:52,985
Someone shoot osama bin laden in

25
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:53,853
The face?

26
00:00:53,854 --> 00:00:58,624
[laughter]

27
00:00:58,625 --> 00:00:59,992
It felt like the events were

28
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:01,694
Connected, like maybe we'd

29
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:02,828
Finally put all these ginned up

30
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:05,197
And ridiculously overblown

31
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:06,332
Non-controversies, like the

32
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:10,169
Birther thing, to rest.

33
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,570
We were going to focus on things

34
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:12,972
That matter, winning the war on

35
00:01:12,973 --> 00:01:14,240
Terror, the budget, fiscal

36
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,275
Things, getting things done.

37
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:16,976
Well, I hope you enjoyed that

38
00:01:16,977 --> 00:01:17,610
Period of time.

39
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:19,044
>> first lady michelle obama is

40
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:20,813
Hosting a poetry reading, and

41
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:22,181
One of her guests is raising a

42
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:24,917
Lot of eyebrows tonight.

43
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:28,487
He's a chicago poet and a rapper

44
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:29,121
Who goes by the stage name

45
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:29,622
"common."

46
00:01:29,623 --> 00:01:30,256
>> he's a reverend wright

47
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:33,759
Defender.

48
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,460
It sounds like he's a promotor

49
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:34,927
Of cop-killing.

50
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:35,561
I've looked at some of his

51
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:39,431
Lyrics.

52
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:43,302
They are raunchy.

53
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:43,769
They are rough.

54
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,738
They are raw.

55
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:46,372
>> yeah, let's invite a

56
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:47,606
Misogynist to the white house.

57
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:50,776
[laughter]

58
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,378
>> jon: Are we really doing

59
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:55,181
This again, for this guy,

60
00:01:55,182 --> 00:02:03,189
Common, the guy from the queen

61
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:03,923
Latifah rom com?

62
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:06,125
The guy from the gap ads?

63
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,927
Elmo's friend?

64
00:02:07,928 --> 00:02:11,263
That's the guy?

65
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:12,798
That's the guy we're going to do

66
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,633
This for?

67
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:15,434
That's your misogynist copicidal

68
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:19,638
Black supremacist?

69
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:23,342
Hey, fox news, have you told the

70
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:25,110
People who work on foxnews.Com

71
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:25,644
Yet?

72
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:26,278
>> I am here with common.

73
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:28,080
How you doing?

74
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:29,381
>> what's going on?

75
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:31,250
How you doing?

76
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:32,084
>> you're known as the conscious

77
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:32,418
Rapper?

78
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:33,152
How important is that to you and

79
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:33,886
How important do you think that

80
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:34,954
Is to our kids?

81
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:36,655
>> jon: Well, I guess that

82
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:39,058
Explains fox news.Com's slogan,

83
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:39,792
Shhh, fox news doesn't realize

84
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:41,794
We're here.

85
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:43,329
[laughter]

86
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,931
I mean, for god's sake, this

87
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:48,367
Two-time, grammy-winning,

88
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:49,802
Vegetarian's invite to the white

89
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:52,304
House has the twitterverse very

90
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:55,774
Upset, and by twitterverse, I

91
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:57,443
Don't mean people on twitter.

92
00:02:57,444 --> 00:03:00,145
I mean twits, who took the time

93
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:01,814
To ignore common's entire body

94
00:03:01,815 --> 00:03:04,016
Of work, save for one poem he

95
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,185
Wrote in 2007 that they appear

96
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:10,289
To misunderstand.

97
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,658
>> burn a bush because for peace

98
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:15,327
He no push no buttons.

99
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,095
>> no weapons of mass

100
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,496
Destruction, how can we follow a

101
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:19,031
Leader when this is a correct

102
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:19,331
One.

103
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:22,101
>> my uzi weighs a ton.

104
00:03:22,102 --> 00:03:23,769
>> he's talking about popin'

105
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,170
Guns and I got the black strap

106
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:27,740
To make the cops run.

107
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:30,042
They watching me, I watching

108
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:30,342
Them.

109
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:32,678
>> whoa, whoa, whoa, when we

110
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,079
Roll together with a strapped

111
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,347
Gun, we're going to be rocking

112
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:36,048
Them to sleep.

113
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,616
That sounds like killing cops to

114
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:37,883
Me.

115
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:38,484
>> whoa, whoa.

116
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,252
>> that sounds like killing cops

117
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:40,819
To me.

118
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,554
Sound like killing cops to you?

119
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:43,455
>> jon: No.

120
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:45,291
Well, if you enjoyed, that

121
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:47,593
You'll love this album of fox

122
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,428
News personalities ruining songs

123
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,397
From many of your other favorite

124
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:52,231
Hip-hop artists.

125
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,499
Now that's what those people

126
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,602
Call music.

127
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:57,870
[applause]

128
00:03:57,871 --> 00:03:59,972
Now, those more expolice celt

129
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:02,708
Lyrics, the more explicit lyrics

130
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,743
Describing violent action that

131
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,412
Hannity was quoting, those

132
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,647
Lyrics actually end on the

133
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:11,250
Couplet, "no time for that cause

134
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,618
There's things to be done.

135
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,153
Stay true to what I do so the

136
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:15,721
Youth dream come."

137
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:16,689
Basically common says, you know

138
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:17,823
That violence I was talking

139
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,358
About earlier in my poem, let's

140
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,060
End that in our communities so

141
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:22,461
Our dreams can come true.

142
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:24,663
It's a call for peace.

143
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:26,098
But hannity makes a good point.

144
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,233
It sounds like killing cops to

145
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:29,768
Him.

146
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,036
[laughter]

147
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:32,738
And if fox newsstands for

148
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:36,608
Anything, it is a zero-tolerance

149
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:37,843
Policy for any individual who

150
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:39,545
Might have or actually did write

151
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:41,413
A song about cop killing.

152
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:43,482
>> and happy birthday to rapper

153
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:46,352
And actor ice-t.

154
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:48,253
He is 52.

155
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:55,361
[cheers and applause]

156
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:57,229
>> jon: Well, to be fair,

157
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,764
That's different because ice-t

158
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:00,299
Was not celebrating his birthday

159
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,267
With obama.

160
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:03,802
What about the phrase in

161
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:07,740
Common's poem, "killing over oil

162
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:09,775
Burn a bush, because for peace

163
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:12,478
He no push no button."

164
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,413
It appears to be a metaphorical

165
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:15,948
Call of violence against the

166
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:17,082
President, and while it isn't,

167
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,817
You can say it was.

168
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:19,284
[laughter]

169
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:20,552
It would be like saying to the

170
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:21,954
Critics of the president, don't

171
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:24,690
Retreat, reload, you know, or

172
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:26,291
Drawing targets over your

173
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:27,893
Political opponents.

174
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:29,261
Surely fox wouldn't defend that

175
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:30,696
Type of incendiary language.

176
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:33,399
>> we've heard sarah palin say

177
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,067
That her supporters shouldn't

178
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,935
Relax or retreat, they should

179
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:37,269
Reload.

180
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,905
>> which is a very alaska-type

181
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:40,205
Term.

182
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:42,274
>> political rhetoric often use

183
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:43,542
Military term, holding your

184
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:45,177
Fire, search and destroy, that

185
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:45,744
Kind of thing.

186
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:47,679
>> it's very sinister to me

187
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,214
Because I think there is an

188
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:50,048
Effort here to silence

189
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:50,582
Opposition voices.

190
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,317
>> anything to shut her down,

191
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:54,119
Shut me up, shut talk radio

192
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,255
Down, shut fox news off.

193
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:58,123
Then everything will be sunshine

194
00:05:58,124 --> 00:05:59,124
And lollipops.

195
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,893
>> jon: Oh, right.

196
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:02,161
Oh, right, like the obama

197
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:03,362
Administration would allow us to

198
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,899
Have sunshine and lollipops.

199
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,469
Ha, ha, more like spf50 and

200
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,837
Broccoli.

201
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:12,738
[laughter]

202
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:13,572
But you know what, maybe I

203
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:15,307
Should re-examine some of these

204
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:15,774
Lyrics.

205
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:18,944
Maybe I'm being unfair by

206
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:20,045
Showing fox news personalities

207
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,480
Holding a musician to a much

208
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,148
Higher standard of language and

209
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,516
Behavior than a presidential

210
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:24,917
Candidate.

211
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:28,187
Anybody who wrote a song with

212
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:30,155
The lyric, "first time I

213
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:31,824
Shotter, shotter in the side,

214
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:33,225
Hard to watch her suffer, but

215
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,727
With the second shot she died"

216
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,262
Or, "early one morning while

217
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:39,064
Making my rounds, I took a shot

218
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,266
Of cocaine and I shot my woman

219
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:41,567
Down."

220
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:44,436
That is some hard-core

221
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:44,803
[bleeped].

222
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:46,472
I hope a killer like that is

223
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:48,373
Never allowed anywhere near a

224
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:49,775
President of these united

225
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:50,108
States.

In reno just to watch him die.

[mimicking george bush laughing]

237
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:18,737
Seriously, hannity, what's the

238
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:19,137
Difference?

239
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:20,806
What's the difference?

240
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:22,708
Would you be this concerned

241
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,409
About a musician who used the

242
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,511
Same type of rhetoric or

243
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:26,245
Violence about president obama.

244

>> if this was somebody who used

The same type of rhetoric about

Violence against president

247
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:34,920
Obama, I would be against it.

00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,396
You look bad.

253
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:44,796
[laughter]

254
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,933
Too bad we spent all day having

255
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:49,568
So much fun listening to johnny

256
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:51,136
Cash album, so we didn't have

257
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,804
Chance to find a tape that would

258
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:56,208
Be the absolute clearest -- I'm

259
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:56,542
Kidding.

260
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:58,544
We have it.

00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:04,416
>> you punk.

00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:07,252

[laughter]

I barely even get angry about

This.

279
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,485
I just feel sorry for you guys

280
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:40,819
Now.

281
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,220
It took longer to play that clip

282
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:45,557
Than it took to find it.

283
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:46,692
We've actually started burying

284
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:47,926
These tapes around the office

285
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:50,862
Just to make it sporting.

286
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,064
[laughter]

287
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:54,333
It's almost impossible to

288
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:57,903
Express how ridiculous this and

289
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:59,705
You all are at this point.

290
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,540
It's beyond a caricature of your

291
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,107
Own cartoon.

292
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:04,042
I think the only way to get it

293
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,144
Across would be through a more

294
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:08,447
Artful medium, a more expressive

295
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:10,382
Form, perhaps a musical

296
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,918
Iteration of the spoken word.

297
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:18,023
Give me a beat, yo!

298
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:24,429

Yeah, yeah

301
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:31,236
 this goes out to fox news

302
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,939
And all the pundits I address on

303
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,406
Tonight's show

304
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,708
 yo, fox

305

You create shocks with now awe

306
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:41,113
 you dress like eagles

307
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:43,582
But squawk like chicken hawks

308
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:49,254
 you're pigeons on a statue

309
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,089
Leaving little lies behind you.

310
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,290

Comma

314
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:00,032
 because I need a minute to

315
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:01,299
Think of what would say next

316
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:05,737
 that would rhyme

317
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:07,239
[laughter]

318
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,240
You push [bleeped]

You got lazy

00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:17,783
 it's crazy

324
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:18,917
Even glenn beck's leaving

325
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:23,755
 because he thinks you're

326
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:24,156
Forgazy

327
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:27,159

I know that you feel me

00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:49,247
 because I joke to the folks

337
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:52,117
While you choke on their smoke

338
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:58,990

Program.

I will never rap publicly again.

Welcome back to the program.

00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:33,225
Osama bin laden is still dead,

349
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:34,760
Which creates an important

350
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:36,662
Question: Who will be america's

351
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:38,063
Next toppenmy?

352
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:39,498
With more on the search for next

353
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:42,000
Bin laden, we turn to lewis

354
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:47,472
Black and "back in black."

355
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:50,042
[cheers and applause]

356
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,611
>> exciting times for al qaeda.

357
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:55,113
For the first time in decades,

358
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:56,782
There's an opening at the top,

359
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:59,217
And they shouldn't have any

360
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,686
Problem filling it.

361
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:02,654
It's got a good starting salary,

362
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:05,624
Great benefits, plus you get

363
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:08,493
Cable.

364
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:11,897
So let's take a look at the

365
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:12,297
Applicants.

366
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:14,766
Wow me, people.

367
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:17,536
Well, the obvious choice is

368
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:18,670
Osama's second in command.

369
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:20,439
>> ayman al-zawahiri considered

370
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,107
By almost everyone who knew him,

371
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:23,742
Terrorism experts, to be

372
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,177
Dangerous and capable.

373
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:27,279
>> dangerous and capable?

374
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,181
I got the same performance

375
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:31,083
Review when I worked at foot

376
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,318
Locker.

377
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:33,785
[laughter]

378
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:37,989
You phase one eight-year-old.

379
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,958
Well, I'm satisfied.

380
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,294
He sounds perfect.

381
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:43,128
Any down side?

382
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:45,464
>> zawahiri, he doesn't have it.

383
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:46,598
He's a classic number.

384
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,266
Two he's not a number one.

385
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,901
>> I don't know.

386
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:51,970
The last number one sure seemed

387
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:54,906
Like a number two to me.

388
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:55,407
[laughter]

389
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:57,476
I'm talking about poop.

390
00:12:57,477 --> 00:12:59,111
>> jon: Yes.

391
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,880
I know, lou.

392
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:07,853
>> who else sent in a red --

393
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:08,186
Resume?

394
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:13,558
>> an war alawarki.

395
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:16,628
He speaks english fluent

396
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,028
Obviously.

397
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:18,597
He speaks in a language that

398
00:13:18,598 --> 00:13:19,331
Young people can understand.

399
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:20,832
>> he's down with the kids.

400
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,468
He even has his own app.

401
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:27,172
It's called "really angry

402
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:27,939
Birds."

403
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:32,310
Death to america and pigs.

404
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,579
This guy sounds pretty great,

405
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,816
But sitting backwards on his

406
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,518
Prayer mat and rapping with the

407
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,452
Kids isn't enough.

408
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:41,153
What's the catch?

409
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,421
>> he's in yemen.

410
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:44,189
He's not in afghanistan and

411
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,657
Pakistan with the other al qaeda

412
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:45,991
Leaders.

413
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,859
The last thing they need is to

414
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,061
Try to do this across seas,

415
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:56,635
Across ocean, across country

416
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:58,403
Country lines.

417
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:00,739
>> and he's not moving to

418
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,106
Pakistan.

419
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:03,642
Have you seen what $1 million

420
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:05,210
Gets you in abbottabad?

421
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:06,678
Not to mention what you have to

422
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,213
Pay the government to pretend

423
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:09,080
You're not there.

424
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:12,017
Now maybe we should look at a

425
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,151
Few resumes.

426
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:15,287
Here's an interesting candidate.

427
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:17,088
>> mastermind of a serious plot

428
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:18,223
Last year to target europe.

429
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:20,158
>> I like him, but no one would

430
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,994
Believe he's a terrorist.

431
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:24,796
Because he looks like he's

432
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:26,631
Disguised as a terrorist.

433
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:29,801
[laughter]

434
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:31,570
Well, let's wrap this up.

435
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:36,241
I've got time for one more.

436
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:38,777
>> once a battlefield commander

437
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:41,346
In afghanistan who rose to

438
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:43,748
Prominence for escaping from

439
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:45,016
Bagram air base.

440
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:47,085
>> is al qaeda really ready for

441
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:48,086
A black leader.

442
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:49,788
I know obama was a big hit, but

443
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:51,022
Republicans tried to jump on

444
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:53,225
That bandwagon, too, and look

445
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:58,730
How that worked out.

446
00:14:58,731 --> 00:14:59,898
Laughter I don't know, though,

447
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,433
No one really stood out.

448
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:03,869
But if al qaeda is just looking

449
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:07,372
For a guy full of hate, to yell

450
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:10,542
Into a camera every few months,

451
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:14,646
They can do worse.

452
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:14,913
Jon?

453
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,181
>> jon: Thank you very much,

454
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:16,515
Lewis.

455
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:17,782
So generous of you.

456
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:30,195
>> jon: Welcome back.

457
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:31,029
My guest tonight, oh, the

458
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,098
Funnest writer, actor, director,

459
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:34,499
Also now a novelist.

460
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,635
His new book is called "2030:

461
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:37,903
The real story of what happens

462
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:39,004
To america."

463
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:39,638
Please welcome back to the

464
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:42,774
Program the great albert brooks.

465

[cheers and applause]

466
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,954
>> thank you very much.

467
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:56,788
Respect.

468
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:57,889
>> jon: Thank you very much.

469
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,424
>> very nice to see you.

470
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:02,894
>>I want to give you a complime.

471
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:03,728
>> jon: Please.

472
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,397
Is this about the food in the

473
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:07,432
Green room because we try very

474
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:07,732
Hard?

475
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:08,066
>> no.

476
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:09,200
The last week and a half of all

477
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:10,502
The shows, your bin laden stuff

478
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:11,670
Has been the best.

479
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:13,571
>> jon: Thank you very much.

480
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:14,139
[cheers and applause]

481
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,508
>> and you also did this thing

482
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:18,476
Last week, you had the animated

483
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,210
Royal wedding.

484
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:21,379
>> jon: Yes.

485
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,214
I got the taiwanese animators to

486
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:24,482
Do a project for us.

487
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:25,884
They came in and the greatest

488
00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:27,152
Phone calls in the world were

489
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,954
Passed back and forth.

490
00:16:28,955 --> 00:16:31,189
Can I get hitler with strapon?

491
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:31,756
Okay, thank you.

492
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:33,692
>> well, actually, they have

493
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:36,027
That in the catalog.

494
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:37,262
Stock foodage.

495
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:38,797
I want to talk about this

496
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:39,931
Wedding for a moment because I

497
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:42,367
Think I need to see a sigh die

498
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:43,835
Trisms I can't stop thinking

499
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,136
About this kate middleton.

500
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:46,171
>> jon: Really?

501
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:46,871
>> seriously.

502
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:48,340
I dream about her, I think about

503
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:48,707
Her.

504
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:51,977
I want to be her first jew.

505
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:55,447
[cheers and applause]

506
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:58,583
And I'm sure only jew.

507
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:00,151
I want to wake up with this

508
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:05,056
Woman, and what is all this

509
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:05,423
Hair?

510
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:09,361
Maybe I fell a sleep with a mop.

511
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:10,795
I can't stop thinking about her.

512
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:12,397
>> jon: Is this the first

513
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:12,697
Time?

514
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:13,832
What is it about her?

515
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,900
Is it the youthfulness of her?

516
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:17,302
>> no.

517
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:19,070
>> jon: I have not spent much

518
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:25,143
Time thinking about this, but...

519
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:26,745
You definitely need to see a

520
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:27,812
Psychaiatrist.

521
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:29,414
>> the whole world, I don't

522
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:30,915
Know, we need a king.

523
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,550
I want to bow down to somebody,

524
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:33,885
What can I tell you.

525
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:34,452
Anyway, go on.

526
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:35,854
>> jon: This is why... What

527
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:37,655
You have done... Remember

528
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:39,024
Defending your life painted such

529
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:41,326
A great picture of heaven and

530
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:43,528
Hell and the afterlife, you have

531
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:47,332
Now in novel form done sort of a

532
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:51,636
George orwell, kurt vonnegut,ed

533
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:53,304
A lewis huxley, this is the

534
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:54,305
World in 2030.

535
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:55,974
>> I tried to write what I

536
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:57,108
Really thought could happen,

537
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:59,377
Because most future stuff,

538
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:00,378
Nothing comes true.

539
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,347
You know, I mean, when I was a

540
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:04,282
Kid, I read about the flying

541
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:04,649
Cars.

542
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:05,216
>> jon: Sure.

543
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:06,985
>> come on, jon.

544
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:10,855
You ever see jews drive in

545
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:11,189
Miami?

546
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,491
You think they're going to be

547
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:14,459
Flying in the air?

548
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:18,029
Beep, beep, what is that?

549
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:21,666
It's just shut up.

550
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,134
>> jon: Is that the most fun

551
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:25,303
Part of doing this?

552
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:26,704
What I love about the book is

553
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:28,973
Every little thing that you see

554
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:31,476
Sort of as an eccentricity in

555
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:32,877
Modern society today you

556
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:34,412
Extrapolate and you create these

557
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:35,580
Great... The main conflict of

558
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:37,982
This is the old versus sort of

559
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:40,852
The younger generation.

560
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:42,787
>> yes, I feel and I can see it

561
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,856
In my own children that in a

562
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:45,957
Number of years these younger

563
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,325
People are going to try to kill

564
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:48,393
Us.

565
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:54,365
[laughter]

566
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:56,501
>> you know, it's...

567
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:57,869
>> jon: When you see that in

568
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:58,903
Your own children...

569
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:00,004
>> it's something I sense.

570
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:02,507
I made that movie "real life,"

571
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:06,377
And I was right about reality

572
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:07,679
Television, don't screw with me.

573
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,481
>> jon: If you ever get to see

574
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,716
"real life," this t greatest.

575
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:14,252
It's like nostradamus but so

576
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:14,752
Funny.

577
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:15,286
I love you.

578
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:18,123
Can I just tell you, I love your

579
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:18,456
Movies.

580
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:23,528
Their just so damn good.

581
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:23,928
[applause]

582
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:25,330
I can see...

583
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,732
>> yes, I wrote this as a novel

584
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:29,067
Because I'm only give an small

585
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:29,434
Budget.

586
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:31,603
I can't write... No, seriously.

587
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:33,438
You know, my screen writing is

588
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:35,473
Like... I've learned how to

589
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:37,308
Write to a few million dollars.

590
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:39,277
You write, it was a dark and

591
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:40,245
Stormy night and then you cross

592
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:42,614
Out that and you write, it was a

593
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:44,616
Clear night and then you

594
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:45,016
Realize...

595
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,084
>> we can't afford rain.

596
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:48,887
>> then you realize night's too

597
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:50,021
Expensive.

598
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,723
Then you write, "he woke up in a

599
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:54,359
Room with the blinds closed."

600
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,761
But here I have a pilotless jet

601
00:19:56,762 --> 00:20:00,098
Quietly landing at reagan

602
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:00,698
International airport.

603
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:03,801
I wrote that and I looked behind

604
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:05,503
Like someone was going to arrest

605
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:05,837
Me.

606
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:07,672
You got to go to writer's jail.

607
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:08,506
You can't write that.

608
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:10,275
That was why I wanted to write a

609
00:20:10,276 --> 00:20:11,242
Novel.

610
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:12,844
>> jon: As someone who is

611
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:16,014
Accustomed to to feedback for

612
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:18,016
Movie audiences, live audiences,

613
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:19,884
Did this drive you crazy?

614
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,452
>> no, this is glorious.

615
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:24,155
The thing I like least is test

616
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:24,556
Audiences.

617
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:25,857
>> jon: The feedback is the

618
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:26,157
Worst.

619
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:27,926
>> some people do well with

620
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:28,426
Cards.

621
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:31,763
I imagine steven spielberg, god

622
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:35,533
Gave him cards when he was born.

623
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:37,635
But I'm telling you, modern

624
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:38,770
Romance, you know, they pick up

625
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:40,438
The cards, right, why is all

626
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:45,610
That hair on his back?

627
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:47,111
So this was a wonderful

628
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:48,646
Experience to be able to write

629
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:51,316
For a year and a half and alone

630
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:52,050
Without any studio.

631
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:54,118
>> well, I'm going to do that.

632
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,787
If you have a couple minutes and

633
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:57,889
You're very gracious, I'm sorry,

634
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:00,158
We're going to throw the rest

635
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,392
Of... I just want to ask you

636
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:02,660
Some questions of comedy and

637
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:03,928
Things like that if that's okay.

638
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:07,365
The book is "2030" albert

639
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:08,833
Brooks, you got to go pick this

640
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:18,810
>> that's our show.

641
00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:20,211
Here it is, your moament of zen.

642
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:22,914
>> art and literature are often

643
00:21:22,915 --> 00:21:24,482
The first targets of tyranny

644
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:25,717
Because they're the most

645
00:21:26,717 --> 00:21:29,717
Subs straight from CC
