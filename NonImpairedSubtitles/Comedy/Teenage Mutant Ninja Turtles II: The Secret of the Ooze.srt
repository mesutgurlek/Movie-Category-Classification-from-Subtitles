1
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:34,056
Okay, lady. Two slices for you.
Come on.

2
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:38,290
Keno!

3
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:40,161
Yo, Keno!
Come on now, saddle up.

4
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:42,793
We got another order
for that O'Neil woman.

5
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:44,769
Are you kidding me?
Again?

6
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:47,363
She should be
buying it wholesale.

7
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,341
- Okay. Yeah.
- Keno, be careful.

8
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:55,474
Hey, ladies.

9
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:58,312
Which one of you lucky girls
gets a ride with me tonight?

10
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:00,375
Dream on, dweeb.

11
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,387
Yeah, okay.

12
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:05,219
But when i do, i'll dream
of something a little thinner.

13
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:25,607
April O'Neil.

14
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:46,057
That's nice.

15
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:49,397
- Stack it over here.
- Six boxes.

16
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,365
Hold it!

17
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:55,168
You guys are under arrest.

18
00:02:56,843 --> 00:03:00,609
- What are you, night security?
- Well, no. Actually, i'm...

19
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,341
pizza delivery.

20
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:04,406
Cut me a break.

21
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,616
Down we go!

22
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:18,822
Stay down!

23
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:23,330
Did i mention
i study martial arts?

24
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:27,066
- Okay, let's move it.
- Hey, who's this guy?

25
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,404
- Let's get him.
- Help.

26
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:32,467
You're gonna need it, kid.
Come on.

27
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:49,994
- Let's get out of here!
- Let's go! Move it out! Move it!

28
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,460
Awesome!

29
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,598
Wicked!

30
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,237
Eclectic!

31
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,301
Eclectic? Geez!

32
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:14,380
Hey, look out!

33
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:16,979
Let me go!
What are you doing?

34
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:22,119
Sorry, kid.
it's for your own good.

35
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:24,891
Let me out of here!

36
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:31,192
Yeah!

37
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,336
Get along there, little doggie!

38
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:39,505
Rawhide! Robocop!
Come on!

39
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:46,944
Ninja cowboy!

40
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:54,854
Oh, you dudes
want to play too?

41
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:01,327
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
Check this!

42
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:05,926
"Walk the Dog."
That's pretty good, huh?

43
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:09,031
And then,
"Around the World!"

44
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:11,906
Hey, hey, now you see 'em,
now you don't!

45
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:15,008
Missed!

46
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:24,850
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

47
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:38,061
Yeah!

48
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:50,948
Missed me!

49
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:59,047
The missing link!

50
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:06,092
You want a pickle?
i'll give you a pickle!

51
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:16,870
Combat cold cuts!

52
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,322
Let's get out of here!

53
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:36,359
And next time
i'll use mustard!

54
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:43,162
Hey. Hey, dude.

55
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:46,296
Give me your hand.
Come on.

56
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:51,610
Who, what, where, huh?

57
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:54,976
Well, that leaves out
"why" and "when," doesn't it?

58
00:06:56,082 --> 00:07:00,075
Yeah! It's a good thing we saw you
coming in here from the roof...

59
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,417
- Hey, Mikey!
- I mean from across the...

60
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,451
Look, kid, you can find a phone
and call the police. Are you okay?

61
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:10,792
- We'll start tying them up.
- Yeah, but...

62
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:14,299
Yeah, yeah, but good. Go!

63
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,536
- Kids.
- Kids.

64
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,697
Come on.

65
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:25,669
Okay, just hurry up.
There's a ton of these guys.

66
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:27,736
Okay, bye.

67
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:57,407
- Well, i hope we can find a cab.
- There are lots of cabs.

68
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,741
- Not at this time of night.
- Hey!

69
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,246
i know you. You're, uh...

70
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,579
- April O'Neil.
- April O'Neil, yeah.

71
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,174
The news lady.

72
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:09,050
So, how are things in
the action-news biz?

73
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:11,055
Pretty tiring, mostly.

74
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:13,182
Well, honey, if you cut back
on the heavy aerobics...

75
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,489
- And all that jumping and yelling...
- It's all right, Muriel.

76
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:17,654
- I find it disturbing.
- Let me get that for you.

77
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:21,996
Oh, right!
My... My aerobics.

78
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:25,731
- I'll do that. Bye.
- Good night, April.

79
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,739
- Was that necessary?
- I saw her on TV.

80
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:30,640
- A skirt walks by and...
- Will you stop it already?

81
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,258
Michaelangelo.

82
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:03,899
Leonardo.

83
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:07,902
Donatello...

84
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,414
and Raphael.

85
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,384
The rat is the cleanest one.

86
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:22,120
Oh, yeah!

87
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,698
Primo workout, dudes!

88
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:29,257
- Yeah!
- We showed those guys, huh?

89
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:32,395
- Muy primo, bros.
- Turtle-riffic!

90
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:35,599
Max-amundo.

91
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:37,142
A cappella!

92
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:42,206
Perestroika?

93
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:45,910
Okay, i got it. "Frerejacques."
FrereJacques

94
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:49,421
- FrereJacques
- Donny, give it up.

95
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:53,621
- Hi, guys.
- Yo, April!

96
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:55,320
What it is? Yeah!

97
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:58,329
- We brought-a dinner.
- Let's eat over here.

98
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:00,991
- Pizza. Again.
- Yup. Pepperoni.

99
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:03,934
Please, please.
A moment to reflect.

100
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:10,603
Here comes the slice.

101
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:12,974
- Enjoy.
- Ninja pizza!

102
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:14,478
Ninja pizza?

103
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:18,108
Pizza that vanish
quickly without trace.

104
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:21,278
- Here you go.
- Yo, Mikey, toss me a ninja slice!

105
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:23,379
Donny, Statue of Liberty!

106
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,516
- Come on, throw it! Over here!
- Mike, no!

107
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:29,823
i'm right here! He's at the forty!
He's at the twenty!

108
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:33,831
He looks. He rolls back.
He goes deep.

109
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:35,764
- Yeah!
- Donatello, stop!

110
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:38,862
Touchdown!
Yeah!

111
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:41,998
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

112
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:45,475
So, any luck finding
a new place to live yet?

113
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:48,741
Well, you know, in this market
it's actually very difficult...

114
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,282
to find good
subterranean housing.

115
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:54,319
Hey, we could always go back
to the old sewer den.

116
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:58,153
- Well...
- Right, Raph. It's a little tough...

117
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:00,920
when about 500 members
of the Foot Clan...

118
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,621
- Know where you live.
- He's right.

119
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:05,823
We kicked their butts.
They're all in jail.

120
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:08,128
'Sides, we took out
the Shredder...

121
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,065
so what's everybody
so worried about?

122
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:11,569
He's right.

123
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:14,128
No. Splinter took out
the Shredder.

124
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:16,697
- They're both right.
- Yeah, yeah.

125
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:19,142
i was there, Leo.
Remember?

126
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:23,272
Old Shred did a swan dive
with a half gainer...

127
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,510
right into the back
of a garbage truck!

128
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,079
Come away from there!

129
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:32,556
Geez, i was just...

130
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,559
Never forget
who you are.

131
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:40,065
You are ninja. You must always
practice the art of invisibility.

132
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:43,499
- All of you.
- Well, i don't get it.

133
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:49,940
i mean, why? We saved the city.
Why can't we just go out and...

134
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:52,910
Stand before me, my sons.

135
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:04,487
For 15 years,
you have been confined below.

136
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:10,496
Now the outside world
beckons your teenage minds...

137
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,498
but they could
never understand.

138
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:17,161
Their world
can never be ours.

139
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:21,937
Not even pizza?

140
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:26,772
Pizza's okay.

141
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:30,277
Man, you give a guy
a heart attack.

142
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:33,811
Here, let me get
you guys some napkins.

143
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:35,751
- What for?
- What for?

144
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:43,621
Take heart, child.
We will not be here much longer.

145
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:47,188
Oh, no, no. You guys can
stay here as long as you want.

146
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,496
- Oh, gee. Thanks a lot.
- No!

147
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:53,402
- We do not belong here above.
- Oh, man!

148
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:55,406
Yes, Master Splinter.

149
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:02,645
Hey! Ten flips now!

150
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,410
Go!

151
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:06,781
Kids.

152
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:11,451
- One.
- One.

153
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:13,583
Such energy is wasted.

154
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:15,854
- Two.
- Remember...

155
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:20,422
the true ninja is
a master of all things...

156
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:23,059
a master of his environment...

157
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:26,002
a master of himself.

158
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:29,905
Focus your thoughts
on where we must go...

159
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:33,741
and leave the Shredder buried.

160
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:41,509
Let's go!

161
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,224
Come on.

162
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:36,440
is this it?

163
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:38,772
Everyone else must've
been picked up.

164
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:41,679
Well, maybe they
didn't find us.

165
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:45,740
Hey, we all knew the junkyard
was our fallback spot.

166
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:52,357
Our father gone!

167
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:55,416
They will pay!

168
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:01,624
i, Tatsu, now lead.

169
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:05,158
Let any who challenge
step forward.

170
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,170
i challenge.

171
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:15,503
His face!

172
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:20,279
Master Shredder!

173
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:27,220
Choose the best man
from those that remain...

174
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:29,488
to follow the reporter.

175
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:34,726
She is the key to finding
the creatures that did this to me.

176
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,131
Yes, Master.

177
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:38,897
Next, Master,
we rebuild the Foot?

178
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:44,906
There is only
one thing next.

179
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:47,445
Revenge.

180
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:49,913
And in this day and age
of ecological abuse...

181
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:53,145
it's nice to find a company
that's doing something to help.

182
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:55,914
joining me on the final day
of their cleanup efforts...

183
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:59,389
is Techno Global Research
industries spokesman...

184
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,926
Professorjordan Perry.

185
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:04,155
Excuse me. Professor?

186
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:08,897
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon, Miss O'Neil.

187
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,300
Professor,
perhaps you can tell us...

188
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:14,669
why TGRi has finally decided
to clean up the waste...

189
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,674
that's been burying here for years.

190
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:18,676
Would you like me
to keep my answer succinct...

191
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:21,304
or will you be able to edit later on
in case i start to ramble...

192
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:25,646
- Which i'm in the habit of doing.
- Professor, we're live.

193
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:28,844
Oh, right, well, yes.

194
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:31,719
Our organization has always
been very concerned...

195
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,156
with the welfare
of the community we serve.

196
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:37,525
- Indeed, TGRI is...
- Man, who is this spasmatic?

197
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:41,422
Would you give the guy a break?
He's a scientist.

198
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,765
Yeah, fascinating.
Hey, isn't Oprah on?

199
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:49,774
Raph, just leave it.
We're watching April.

200
00:16:57,049 --> 00:17:01,145
And dispose of them
in an ecologically more suitable way.

201
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,383
Hey, Mikey, do you think
you can crunch any louder?

202
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:06,754
i can still hear
out of this one.

203
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:18,001
Come on,
let's change this.

204
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:21,733
Hey, maybe somebody's got something
on our fight last night.

205
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:24,709
Do not change channel.

206
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:26,642
Reporting live from
Bayonne, NewJersey...

207
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,306
this is April O'Neil,
Channel Three News.

208
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,440
- Back to you.
- And that's it. We're off.

209
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:34,315
Great.
Thank you.

210
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:38,117
Professor, would you mind if i asked you
a few follow-up questions?

211
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,351
Not at all. Oh, drat!

212
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:42,360
You know, we're gonna
have to do it another time.

213
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:44,726
it's been a great pleasure
meeting you, Miss O'Neil.

214
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:47,857
All press members
must now clear the area.

215
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:53,394
Okay, great.
Report back at 3:00, okay?

216
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:56,236
- Enjoying your first day, Freddy?
- Yeah.

217
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:58,242
Hey, what were you
going to ask him?

218
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:01,302
Well, i don't know.

219
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,349
Don't worry about it.
i'm paid to be suspicious.

220
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:08,518
- Come on, come on.
- Oh, yeah. Sorry.

221
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:15,550
All non-TGRI employees
must now vacate the area.

222
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:18,886
Right here.

223
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:24,161
How could you
have missed this?

224
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:26,170
i don't know.

225
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:28,832
Grab some men.
i'll go find the professor.

226
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:31,398
We've got to
take care of this now.

227
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:33,411
- Go.
- Right.

228
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:39,547
All members of the press must
return their visitor badges...

229
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,643
at the main gate.

230
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:58,636
Dandelions?

231
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:11,876
Now, if the soil is
contaminated so far away...

232
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:14,043
there must be more leaky
canisters than we thought.

233
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:16,144
But how could that be?
They were only buried 15 years ago.

234
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:20,715
Fifteen, fifty. Just make sure
the rest are found and removed.

235
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:23,056
Maybe it wasn't such a good idea
to invite the press.

236
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:26,393
Sometimes the best way to hide
is right out in public.

237
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:29,559
if any of it fell
into the wrong hands...

238
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:31,830
i'm well aware of the risks.

239
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:34,930
Containment team, sector three.

240
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:42,269
This is not the reason
i sent you to follow her.

241
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:46,078
- No, Master, but i thought...
- Silence!

242
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,281
This may be even better.

243
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:55,315
Whatever caused this mutation
may be useful against my enemies.

244
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:59,688
Tatsu, gather your best men.

245
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:02,290
You have a mission tonight.

246
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,955
Hey, guys!
Check this!

247
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:31,621
Wax on. Wax off.

248
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:34,825
- Wax on...
- Mouth off!

249
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,562
- Hey, everyone's a critic.
- Hello?

250
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:39,900
Oh, man!

251
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:43,601
- April, you spoiled our surprise.
- We were gonna clean everything up.

252
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:46,974
Thanks, guys.
Where's Splinter?

253
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,806
He's been up on the roof
ever since he saw your report.

254
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:54,148
Really? Doing what?

255
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:57,711
Coming to a decision.

256
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,916
You've been meditating many hours,
Master Splinter.

257
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:06,294
Yes, and it is time.
join me above.

258
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:10,057
Maybe you better hear
what he has to say.

259
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:14,299
These last hours
have been spent...

260
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:17,968
pondering many questions.

261
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:23,572
Some are the very questions
of our origin.

262
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:25,048
The sewer.

263
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,813
Our transformation.

264
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:31,117
But the answers have
always remained...

265
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:33,953
hidden in the past...

266
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:38,588
veiled by a shadow
too deep to penetrate...

267
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:41,429
until now.

268
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,835
A light from the present...

269
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:51,638
reaches back
to illuminate that shadow.

270
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:55,942
You have never seen this,
but know what it is.

271
00:21:56,682 --> 00:22:01,619
- That's the canister that had the ooze!
- That transformed us all.

272
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:05,623
i have kept it these 15 years.

273
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:09,320
But why do you only show us
now, Master Splinter?

274
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:14,957
TGRi!

275
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:18,025
The interview today.
i knew it!

276
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:21,129
i knew that there was something else
going on with those guys.

277
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:24,698
Yes, and we must know what...

278
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:28,769
for if the contents of this
canister were not unique...

279
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:33,580
the city may now face
grave danger.

280
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:36,450
After all these years.

281
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:39,490
After all this time
wondering who we are.

282
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:44,052
The past returns, my son.

283
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:51,402
it is time to seek our answers.

284
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:27,294
Disposed.

285
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:35,537
Well, you're the last one,
aren't you?

286
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:44,349
- Come on guys.
- I love this spy stuff.

287
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,357
Yeah.

288
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:52,629
Not much to this place.

289
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:56,557
it doesn't look like
there's any night security...

290
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:58,728
but we better
move in quiet.

291
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:01,102
- Yeah.
- Come on, Leo.

292
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:05,269
What do you say?
Let's do it, eh?

293
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:08,176
- Let's do it!
- Let's do it!

294
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:12,072
- Times Square city!
- I don't believe it!

295
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:15,745
- Like video games in 3-D!
- Totally massive!

296
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:19,820
Would you get a load
of this crazy joint!

297
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:23,827
The past returns. I knew
we'd find something special.

298
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:26,455
i'll say special.
Look at this.

299
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:30,865
- Hey, where do you put the quarter?
- Will you stop messing around?

300
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:33,234
Hey, guys, over there!

301
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:43,677
- What do you make of it, Donny?
- Well, i'm not sure.

302
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:45,682
Looks like just a bunch
of serial numbers.

303
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,547
Let's see, uh...

304
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:50,588
Disposed.
Disposed.

305
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:55,117
- Disposed.
- Hey, dudes, we're too late.

306
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:57,753
Like, uh, no deposit,
no return.

307
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:00,457
Well, except maybe this one.

308
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:02,591
What do you mean?

309
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:03,861
Look!

310
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:06,135
"Active."

311
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:08,365
- Yeah.
- Can you bring up the file?

312
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,238
Well, i could try.

313
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:14,972
But if the database is coded,
the whole system might go down.

314
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:19,406
- Do it!
- Yeah, yeah!

315
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:33,153
- Drag.
- Drat.

316
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:36,428
No, no, no! So close!

317
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:43,133
- What?
- The Foot!

318
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,439
He's got the canister!

319
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:49,912
- Get it!
- I got him!

320
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:09,255
Go, go, go, go!

321
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:32,452
- Throw it over here.
- Go long! Go long!

322
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:35,084
Down field!
Turtle in the open!

323
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:42,160
Ah, one, two, three, punt!

324
00:26:48,406 --> 00:26:51,239
Hey, guys, huddle.
Come here. Come on.

325
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:54,244
Mikey, you go up the middle.
You guys take the sides.

326
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:57,611
- Got it.
- I don't get it.

327
00:26:57,682 --> 00:26:58,842
Ready, break!

328
00:27:22,073 --> 00:27:24,871
Hey, Mikey, surf's up, dude!

329
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:29,777
Wipe out!

330
00:27:33,184 --> 00:27:35,243
Ninja vanish!

331
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:44,985
Oh, great!

332
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:49,163
Terrific!

333
00:27:51,202 --> 00:27:53,193
Wonderful!

334
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:59,366
Bummer!

335
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:06,241
And this was the only one?

336
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:08,615
Then it's time to
find out exactly...

337
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:12,817
what this ooze can do.

338
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:15,883
isn't it, Professor?

339
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:21,190
We'll find a home soon, Paulina,
and then it'll be just you and me.

340
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:24,633
Now, look, we've all talked about it.
We've decided to do it...

341
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:27,604
- And that's all there is to it.
- But i don't understand.

342
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:30,232
You guys haven't even found
a new place to live yet.

343
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:34,608
it's too dangerous to stay here with you
when the Foot are out there.

344
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:36,647
They might be looking for us.

345
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:39,479
We could go looking for them
for a change.

346
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,576
i mean, they've got the ooze.

347
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:45,350
- First we move, then we look.
- I don't know about you guys...

348
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:49,154
- But i could really go for a slice of...
- Pizza!

349
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,660
Whoa! Spookular!

350
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,993
Miss O'Neil?

351
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,027
Wait! I'll be right there.

352
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:09,144
- What?
- I didn't order any pizza.

353
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:12,479
Oh, i know.
But the guy in 313 did...

354
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:15,018
and now he doesn't
seem to be there.

355
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:18,621
i figured since you
order so much anyway...

356
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,250
that, you know, maybe you...

357
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:26,096
- Where'd these come from?
- Those...

358
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:27,825
are mine!

359
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:29,958
Yeah. I...

360
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:34,061
i like to do a little chucking
every now and then.

361
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:42,473
Yeah.
i'd keep practicing.

362
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:45,983
On second thought,
why don't i take this pizza anyway?

363
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:48,917
i can always use more.
Let me get my wallet.

364
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:50,420
No, that's okay.

365
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:52,422
- Yes, please.
- Don't worry about it.

366
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:55,084
One last thing, though.
You might want to know about this!

367
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:59,096
- You guys!
- What's the big idea?

368
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:02,759
Can i hurt him? Please!
Tell me i can hurt him!

369
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:04,961
- Please, please!
- Take it easy.

370
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:12,506
i think you'd better sit down.

371
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:24,049
And with an old
Renaissance art book...

372
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:26,989
i found in a storm drain...

373
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:29,492
i gave them all names.

374
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:31,654
Yeah.

375
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:35,324
i'm Leonardo.

376
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,493
i'm Michaelangelo.

377
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:40,971
Donatello.

378
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,973
i'm Rafael.

379
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:45,771
Yeah, all the good ones
end in "O."

380
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:50,073
- Michaelangelo!
- Yeah?

381
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:53,242
- Go!
- All right.

382
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:56,651
i can't believe
every time i...

383
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,222
One.

384
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:04,927
- Two.
- Basically, what you're telling me...

385
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:08,056
is you guys were all slimed!

386
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:13,495
it wasn't slime. It was ooze.
And there's more of it out there.

387
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:15,903
- Where?
- We're not sure.

388
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:18,738
See, there's this sort of
clan of ninja thieves.

389
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:21,108
- A secret group. They call themselves...
- The Foot?

390
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:23,739
- You've heard of'em?
- The word is out...

391
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:26,875
that these guys are looking
for anybody they can find...

392
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:29,977
with martial arts talent,
especially teenagers.

393
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:36,825
Hey, and if i let myself get recruited,
guess what that might lead us to?

394
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,090
No way, Keno.

395
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:41,427
Forget about it.

396
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:45,162
Believe me, i really hate to say this,
but the kid's got a...

397
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:47,727
- No!
- Why not?

398
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:50,865
Too dangerous.

399
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:52,375
But i thought we...

400
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:55,678
Oh, man.

401
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,375
Twenty.

402
00:31:58,449 --> 00:32:01,441
Twenty-one.
Twenty...

403
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,017
One? Yeah.

404
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:18,491
And these are the two most vicious
animals you could find?

405
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:21,538
Good.

406
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:24,302
- Professor?
- Preparations are complete, however...

407
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:27,640
- Begin!
- I must re-register my protest...

408
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:29,839
and remind you
of the immense danger if...

409
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:36,582
That's enough talk from me.
We'll begin.

410
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:10,780
Yes.

411
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:19,622
- Clear.
- Go, go. Move.

412
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:29,029
- See ya, April.
- Bye.

413
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:32,971
Wish us luck.

414
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:39,773
We'll be back for Splinter.

415
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:45,654
The lives of two people don't amount
to a hill of beans in this crazy world.

416
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:47,657
That's why you're
gettin' on that plane.

417
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:50,091
- Maybe not today, maybe not to...
- Would you stop!

418
00:33:51,295 --> 00:33:52,626
See ya.

419
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:13,578
All right, hold it.
This is stupid.

420
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:15,642
We got the Foot up there
with the ooze...

421
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,154
and we're down here
playing "Century 21."

422
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:20,486
- Raph!
- Come on, Leo.

423
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:23,152
Even you could think of something
better to do than this.

424
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:26,219
i already have.
Now, let's get going!

425
00:34:26,297 --> 00:34:28,595
That's it.
i'm goin' up.

426
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:32,669
- No, you're not!
- Let go of my arm, Leo.

427
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:36,605
Guys, guys, guys!
i just got an idea.

428
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:39,700
Two words that could solve
all our housing problems.

429
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:43,042
Time share!

430
00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:46,106
- Not quite ripe yet.
- I'm outta here.

431
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:48,880
But... Oh, man!

432
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:52,188
Oh, boy.

433
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:55,492
- Come on.
- Yeah.

434
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:00,463
- Finding a home should be easy.
- But no!

435
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:02,795
You'd think even an idiot
could find a place down here.

436
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:04,391
But no...

437
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:09,062
Oh, no!
Mikey, buddy!

438
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:12,337
- Mikey, are you okay?
- Mikey!

439
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:15,379
Check it out!

440
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:16,811
Yeah!

441
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:20,840
- Whoa!
- Okay, bro? Come on, Leo!

442
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,513
- You all right?
- No prob.

443
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:36,558
Power! Yeah.

444
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:42,171
Oh, yeah!

445
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:46,969
Look. I don't believe this.

446
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:52,573
- Yes!
- Yes, yes!

447
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:58,053
it's like spider city!

448
00:35:58,122 --> 00:36:00,215
Great!

449
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:03,055
Rock-a-bye-baby.

450
00:36:03,127 --> 00:36:05,061
it's roomy!

451
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:07,620
And it's well hidden, huh?

452
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:09,689
So what do ya think?

453
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:15,398
You know, i hear the sewers
in Connecticut are really nice.

454
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:17,771
- Yeah. Come on.
- This is great!

455
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:27,812
- How much longer?
- Look, i told you, i don't know.

456
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:30,012
it takes time. Days!

457
00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:33,113
i want them
as soon as possible.

458
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:36,183
- I told...
- Sit down!

459
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:39,320
Aren't these enough
for your vengeance?

460
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:42,628
The Foot have already
failed against them.

461
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,964
i have failed.

462
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:51,102
But the next time
will be different.

463
00:36:51,175 --> 00:36:55,805
The next fight will be
freak against freak!

464
00:37:00,451 --> 00:37:04,148
April, will you listen
just for a minute?

465
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,156
it's a ratings week!

466
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:09,682
Phil, i told you.
i am following up on TGRi.

467
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,160
There's more going on there
than we know.

468
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:15,859
Look, that story is over.
We need something solid.

469
00:37:15,933 --> 00:37:20,336
Something fresh.
i mean, like... like this.

470
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:23,669
- She's busy right now.
- "Looking ahead.

471
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:26,209
- Swimsuits in the '90s"?
- My interest is peaked.

472
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:29,178
Phil, i gotta get going.

473
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,306
You are always so busy.

474
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:34,215
i'm the news manager here, April!

475
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:37,186
April, there's a call for you.

476
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:40,521
Tell them i'll call them back.

477
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:44,083
He sounds pretty insistent.
Says his name's Donny.

478
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:47,858
Listen, tell Donny that she's busy
with her news manager right now...

479
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,490
and that she can't...

480
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:57,005
Where are you guys?
Did you find a place to live yet?

481
00:37:57,074 --> 00:37:59,338
Oh, yeah, but i...

482
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:03,546
it's not much right now,
but we'll bring you down.

483
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,707
We've only really
had time to get Splinter...

484
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,808
- And pick up a few essentials.
- Yeah!

485
00:38:07,885 --> 00:38:10,353
The bare essentials!

486
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:13,481
Look, the reason why
we're calling is...

487
00:38:13,557 --> 00:38:16,492
have you seen Raphael
by any chance?

488
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,494
Yeah. Has he stopped by
or anything?

489
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:22,089
No. Why? Is he missing?

490
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:26,728
You know, there's still more stuff
to help with, Michaelangelo!

491
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:29,272
Hey, i'm helping Donny!
Give me the phone.

492
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,900
Hey, give me that...

493
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:35,241
- So you haven't seen him at all?
- No, I haven't.

494
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:38,612
if she does, tell him thanks
for wasting our time!

495
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:40,981
'Cause instead of looking
for the Foot and the ooze...

496
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:42,986
like we should...

497
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:46,956
we gotta go out and look
for him instead.

498
00:38:47,024 --> 00:38:52,462
- What was that?
- Leo says hi.

499
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,498
- Donny, give me the phone.
- If you do hear something...

500
00:38:54,565 --> 00:38:57,898
- Let us know.
- I wanna talk to April! It's important!

501
00:38:57,968 --> 00:39:00,163
- Gimme, gimme, gimme!
- All right, here.

502
00:39:00,237 --> 00:39:03,502
April, it's Mikey.
i'd just like to say...

503
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:06,600
- Hello.
- Would you give me that!

504
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:15,313
The cells will
no longer hold them.

505
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,318
Remove the bar.

506
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:21,984
it's time they learn
who their master is.

507
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:27,420
Remove the bar
and leave us.

508
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,606
Come forth!

509
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:52,284
Wolf. Snapping turtle.
incredible!

510
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:55,152
Yes. Come forward.

511
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:58,024
Attack me, if you will.

512
00:39:58,095 --> 00:40:01,587
When it is over,
you will call me "Master"!

513
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:14,703
- Mama? Oh, Mama!
- Oh, Mama!

514
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:20,339
- Mama.
- Mama.

515
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,682
Get off me!

516
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:26,883
Babies!

517
00:40:26,957 --> 00:40:29,687
They are babies!

518
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,558
What did you expect?
They'd come out quoting Macbeth?

519
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:39,569
- They are stupid!
- They're not stupid. They're infants.

520
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,105
Okay, they're stupid infants.

521
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:50,374
Put that down!

522
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:56,816
Fortunately, they seem to have
imprinted you as their surrogate mother.

523
00:40:56,887 --> 00:41:00,755
- Mama.
- They are of no use to me against a...

524
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,853
See that these two things...

525
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:08,160
are properly disposed of.

526
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:10,223
No. You can't do that.
They're living creatures.

527
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:13,536
Not for long.

528
00:41:13,604 --> 00:41:16,835
Hey, no, no.
Wait, look.

529
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:22,574
They may be
intellectually inferior, but...

530
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:30,617
As you can see, they do have
other attributes.

531
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:38,192
Maybe i'll keep them
around after all.

532
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:50,666
- Hey, man, how's it going?
- Pretty good.

533
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:52,902
- Good to see you, man.
- What's up?

534
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:54,911
Did you just get here?

535
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:58,376
Okay, guys.

536
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:00,713
Listen up.

537
00:42:00,784 --> 00:42:03,514
i'm only going
to tell youse once.

538
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:08,115
All of youse guys is gonna
have to take a little test.

539
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:11,457
Then, if you're good enough...

540
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:15,056
we let you into
the organization.

541
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:18,533
Any questions?

542
00:42:18,602 --> 00:42:20,126
Okay, follow me.

543
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:22,399
- Let's go.
- Lead the way, man.

544
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:35,343
i knew this would work.

545
00:42:35,419 --> 00:42:39,116
just remember, we get you in,
we find the Foot headquarters...

546
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:41,714
we get you out to tell
the others, right?

547
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:44,386
Gee, maybe i should
write this down.

548
00:42:44,461 --> 00:42:46,588
What?

549
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:48,825
i'm being punished, aren't i?

550
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:38,312
- Keno, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

551
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:41,112
You seem to be the only one
worthy of a final test.

552
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:46,687
You'll have 15 seconds to remove
as many of the bells as you can.

553
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,559
One sound and you fail.

554
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:52,994
And another thing,
we work in concealment.

555
00:43:53,063 --> 00:43:55,031
Fifteen seconds.

556
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:56,327
Go!

557
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:14,610
is this enough?

558
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,619
Yeah!

559
00:44:22,626 --> 00:44:24,560
Welcome to our headquarters.

560
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:29,556
Get yourself a training dogi
and meet me back in the yard.

561
00:44:29,633 --> 00:44:31,157
Yeah, right.

562
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,312
Keno, come on.

563
00:44:47,317 --> 00:44:50,309
Okay. Looks like
this is the place.

564
00:44:50,387 --> 00:44:52,321
Yeah, looks like it.

565
00:44:56,627 --> 00:44:59,824
First chance we get,
we're out of here.

566
00:44:59,897 --> 00:45:01,990
What? What is it?

567
00:45:04,234 --> 00:45:06,361
i thought i just saw a ghost.

568
00:45:07,971 --> 00:45:09,233
Come on.

569
00:45:10,174 --> 00:45:13,803
- What are we looking for anyway?
- Quiet. You want to get us...

570
00:45:16,113 --> 00:45:17,671
caught?

571
00:45:17,748 --> 00:45:18,772
Yeah, well...

572
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:24,414
Hi. We were lookin' for
a muffler for a '77 Chevy.

573
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:30,288
Whatever happened
to service with a smile?

574
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:33,990
Yeah!

575
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:42,702
Get out of here kid.
Go tell the others. Go now!

576
00:45:42,773 --> 00:45:45,241
Hey, nice shot.

577
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:47,243
You're good.
Come on.

578
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:52,705
- I'm not gonna just...
- Run, or i'll kick your butt.

579
00:45:56,987 --> 00:45:59,512
Move!
Come on, you guys!

580
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:09,597
Excuse me.
Pardon me.

581
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:15,299
Come on.

582
00:46:15,372 --> 00:46:16,737
Missed.

583
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:20,743
i'm curious.

584
00:46:20,811 --> 00:46:25,077
Any of you guys ever heard
the expression "fair fight"?

585
00:46:27,584 --> 00:46:30,144
You know, pal,
if i had a face like yours...

586
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:33,656
i'd try to make up for it
with some sort of a personality.

587
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:57,413
Come on.
Come on, April, Leo!

588
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,642
if you're there,
it's me, Keno.

589
00:46:59,716 --> 00:47:03,812
Darn. Come on.
Raph's in trouble.

590
00:47:06,757 --> 00:47:08,452
April, where are they?

591
00:47:08,525 --> 00:47:11,221
- It's Raph.
- Wait, calm down. What happened?

592
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:13,456
i've gotta tell the guys.
They got him!

593
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:15,464
Who has got him?

594
00:47:25,642 --> 00:47:27,576
Come on.

595
00:47:28,645 --> 00:47:31,546
- Just like Keno said.
- Yeah.

596
00:47:31,615 --> 00:47:33,879
- The perimeter's quiet.
- Yeah.

597
00:47:33,951 --> 00:47:36,579
A little too quiet.

598
00:47:36,653 --> 00:47:39,281
- Come on.
- Okay.

599
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:53,727
Knock, knock.

600
00:47:57,574 --> 00:48:00,975
- Well, that was easy.
- Yeah, a little too easy.

601
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:09,284
Look, it's Raph!

602
00:48:09,353 --> 00:48:11,583
Yeah, a little too Raph.

603
00:48:11,655 --> 00:48:15,421
You guys, knock it off.
Keep your eyes peeled.

604
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:17,517
i don't like this.

605
00:48:17,594 --> 00:48:18,822
- Let's go.
- Right.

606
00:48:32,342 --> 00:48:35,004
You know, given the layout
of this junkyard...

607
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:37,171
and the proximity
of certain structures...

608
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:39,215
if they were gonna
spring a trap...

609
00:48:39,283 --> 00:48:42,343
they'd probably do it
right about...

610
00:48:46,456 --> 00:48:48,549
Let us out of here!

611
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:50,456
What the...

612
00:48:55,132 --> 00:48:57,726
The Shred dude!
it's him!

613
00:48:57,801 --> 00:49:01,237
i've been waiting for you.

614
00:49:01,305 --> 00:49:04,069
i have a little surprise.

615
00:49:05,642 --> 00:49:10,238
- Oh, no.
- I don't like this.

616
00:49:10,314 --> 00:49:12,248
i wonder what those are for.

617
00:49:12,316 --> 00:49:15,308
Does the word "turtle-kabob"
mean anything to you?

618
00:49:15,385 --> 00:49:19,014
Yeah, right!
Get your arm out of my face.

619
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:25,817
Patience.
First them...

620
00:49:25,896 --> 00:49:29,423
then you.

621
00:49:29,499 --> 00:49:32,491
You know, these nets
are remarkably effective.

622
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:34,503
Very well constructed.

623
00:49:34,571 --> 00:49:37,734
Remind me to drop a line
to Ralph Nader!

624
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:41,266
Wait for my signal
to drop them.

625
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:45,949
i never got to see Paris.

626
00:49:46,016 --> 00:49:49,008
A little closer.

627
00:49:49,086 --> 00:49:51,418
A little closer!

628
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:54,048
Oh, we're almost there!

629
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,149
Get ready!

630
00:50:04,034 --> 00:50:07,128
Cowabunga!

631
00:50:07,204 --> 00:50:09,729
That's right, Shredder.
You forgot.

632
00:50:09,806 --> 00:50:13,936
- We carry insurance.
- Mutual of Splinter, dude.

633
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:16,070
Get them!

634
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,722
Why don't you just
rip my lips off?

635
00:50:32,796 --> 00:50:35,765
- You'd think...
- Enough.

636
00:50:35,832 --> 00:50:37,993
Here, let me get this first.

637
00:50:50,247 --> 00:50:52,807
Can we talk?

638
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,180
Guess not!

639
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:58,781
Pitiful.

640
00:51:07,664 --> 00:51:08,824
You win.

641
00:51:12,302 --> 00:51:15,135
- Looks like we're on our own.
- All right!

642
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:17,332
Tokka!

643
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:19,705
Rahzar!

644
00:51:31,188 --> 00:51:33,486
Didn't we see these guys
on Wrestlemania?

645
00:51:33,557 --> 00:51:37,391
Prove yourselves to me!
Attack!

646
00:51:39,629 --> 00:51:41,995
Well, you know
what they say.

647
00:51:42,065 --> 00:51:43,999
The bigger they are...

648
00:51:47,671 --> 00:51:49,298
The more bones
they break.

649
00:51:52,909 --> 00:51:56,003
- These guys are mine.
- Go get 'em, Donny.

650
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:59,845
All right, you overgrown,
ugly excuse for a turtle!

651
00:52:05,922 --> 00:52:10,518
You know, maybe that "ugly" crack
was a little bit out of line.

652
00:52:19,069 --> 00:52:21,560
Oh, that hurt!

653
00:52:24,407 --> 00:52:27,001
Hey, you're that TGRi guy.

654
00:52:27,077 --> 00:52:29,011
Hang on.

655
00:52:31,214 --> 00:52:35,651
- I've got to get the hang of that.
- It's okay.

656
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:38,313
i'm gonna get you
out of here.

657
00:52:55,105 --> 00:52:56,265
What?

658
00:52:58,608 --> 00:53:00,803
Oh, am i glad to see you!

659
00:53:03,547 --> 00:53:07,608
- Hey, guys, over here!
- Yeah! We're on our way.

660
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:12,587
Come on, Professor.
We don't have a lot of time.

661
00:53:12,656 --> 00:53:17,423
- Hey, Mikey, we got the TGRi guy.
- Come on, come on.

662
00:53:17,494 --> 00:53:20,952
- Well, actually, i'd rather not.
- Come on!

663
00:53:22,832 --> 00:53:25,494
Step up to the bar, boys!

664
00:53:29,406 --> 00:53:31,340
This way, Leo.
Come on.

665
00:53:32,242 --> 00:53:33,800
You all right, Doc?

666
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:37,176
- Way to go, Mikey!
- Come on. You go next.

667
00:53:37,247 --> 00:53:38,737
Come here.

668
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:42,181
- Come on, Raph.
- Yeah, yeah.

669
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:45,014
Stop them!

670
00:53:49,926 --> 00:53:53,293
- Drop right in, Leo.
- All right!

671
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:09,702
Hey, look at this!

672
00:54:19,889 --> 00:54:20,947
Stupid!

673
00:54:23,393 --> 00:54:26,157
Come on. We gotta
meet back up with Splinter.

674
00:54:26,229 --> 00:54:27,821
Yeah.

675
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,099
Four walking, talking turtles!

676
00:54:37,007 --> 00:54:40,204
Yeah, the guy's Ph.D. material,
all right.

677
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:43,212
You're so intelligent.
it's incredible.

678
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,807
Don't freak, dude.
We can explain. You see...

679
00:54:46,883 --> 00:54:49,010
Fifteen years ago,
you came into contact...

680
00:54:49,085 --> 00:54:51,383
with a green colloidal gel
down in a sewer...

681
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:54,981
which transformed you
into your present state.

682
00:54:56,092 --> 00:54:57,559
Fantastic!

683
00:54:58,161 --> 00:55:01,062
There you go.
Come on. Yeah.

684
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:02,689
Amazing, guys.

685
00:55:02,766 --> 00:55:06,429
i thought all the really
good dungeons were in Europe.

686
00:55:06,503 --> 00:55:08,300
There you go, dude.

687
00:55:11,541 --> 00:55:14,237
- This is wonderful!
- Yeah, okay.

688
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:18,407
We'll give you the tour later.
Right now we've got a few questions.

689
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:23,009
- A few inquiries.
- Yeah, a few...

690
00:55:23,086 --> 00:55:26,613
- We'll give you a tour later.
- Give him room to speak.

691
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:32,120
The professor has much
to tell us.

692
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:42,028
Of course, laboratories
were crude back then...

693
00:55:42,105 --> 00:55:45,233
and an accident was
just waiting to happen.

694
00:55:45,308 --> 00:55:48,835
Wait a minute.
You mean to tell us...

695
00:55:48,912 --> 00:55:52,746
that the formation of the ooze
was all just a big mistake?

696
00:55:52,816 --> 00:55:54,875
Let me see.

697
00:55:54,951 --> 00:55:57,613
Donatello, isn't it?

698
00:55:57,687 --> 00:56:00,349
An unknown mixture
of discarded chemicals...

699
00:56:00,423 --> 00:56:04,257
was accidentally exposed
to a series of radiated waves...

700
00:56:04,327 --> 00:56:07,763
and the resulting ooze
was found to have remarkable...

701
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:11,426
but dangerous
mutanagenic properties.

702
00:56:13,336 --> 00:56:14,701
Big mistake.

703
00:56:19,142 --> 00:56:22,578
- Please continue, Professor.
- Yeah.

704
00:56:22,645 --> 00:56:25,307
Well, on our way to bury them,
a near collision caused us...

705
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:29,944
to lose one of the canisters
down a sewer 15 years ago.

706
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:33,682
Professor Perry,
what's happening at TGRi now?

707
00:56:34,624 --> 00:56:36,615
i imagine they're trying
to remove any evidence...

708
00:56:36,693 --> 00:56:39,253
of the disposal process
and evacuate the premises...

709
00:56:39,329 --> 00:56:42,321
which is standard procedure
when a mishap occurs.

710
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:47,962
And as we know, one or two
rather big mishaps have occurred.

711
00:56:48,037 --> 00:56:51,473
Yeah.
Tokka, Rahzar and the Shredder.

712
00:56:51,541 --> 00:56:54,977
And he's obsessed
with destroying you all.

713
00:56:55,044 --> 00:56:58,104
Yeah, we got that impression,
all right.

714
00:56:58,181 --> 00:56:59,614
- Michaelangelo.
- Yeah?

715
00:56:59,682 --> 00:57:02,150
- Show the professor where he may rest.
- Righty-o!

716
00:57:03,186 --> 00:57:04,983
This way, dude.

717
00:57:05,054 --> 00:57:07,022
it ain't the Hilton.

718
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:12,590
Let's face it. You'd be better off
staying at the Hilton.

719
00:57:20,136 --> 00:57:24,334
What troubles you, my son?

720
00:57:24,407 --> 00:57:28,707
i don't know. I just always thought
there'd be more to it...

721
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:30,803
to the ooze...

722
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,179
to, you know, us!

723
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:36,309
i know.

724
00:57:36,386 --> 00:57:40,755
i always thought
there'd be something.

725
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:43,554
i thought we'd find out
we were special.

726
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:47,858
Do not confuse the specter
of your origin...

727
00:57:47,931 --> 00:57:50,331
with your present worth,
my sons.

728
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:54,860
i don't believe him!
There's just got to be more to it!

729
00:57:54,938 --> 00:57:57,736
Perhaps the search
for a beginning...

730
00:57:57,807 --> 00:58:01,868
rarely has so easy an end.

731
00:58:01,945 --> 00:58:05,176
But our search
will have to wait.

732
00:58:05,248 --> 00:58:09,207
Tonight's encounter
has left us with...

733
00:58:09,285 --> 00:58:11,845
larger problems.

734
00:58:16,025 --> 00:58:16,957
i got 'em.

735
00:58:25,401 --> 00:58:29,394
Go. Play. Have fun.

736
00:58:29,472 --> 00:58:31,406
Fun!

737
00:58:35,044 --> 00:58:38,775
Tonight we leave a calling card
for the turtles.

738
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:43,751
Tomorrow we force
a final confrontation.

739
00:59:10,179 --> 00:59:13,979
- Master say have fun!
- Fun!

740
00:59:15,685 --> 00:59:17,619
Look, Sophie.

741
00:59:17,687 --> 00:59:20,247
Some animals are knocking down
the telephone poles.

742
00:59:20,323 --> 00:59:22,484
What do we do
if they come over here?

743
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:25,119
Let them get
their own cab.

744
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:39,474
Damage is minimal.

745
00:59:39,542 --> 00:59:42,978
And as always, our official report
will be released...

746
00:59:43,046 --> 00:59:44,980
after a thorough investigation.

747
00:59:45,048 --> 00:59:46,982
Thank you, Miss O'Neil.

748
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:49,985
i have no further comments
at this time.

749
00:59:50,053 --> 00:59:51,987
We will be in touch.

750
00:59:52,055 --> 00:59:55,513
More as it develops.
Here you go.

751
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:58,561
Chief Sterns, i wonder
if i might ask you...

752
00:59:58,628 --> 01:00:00,858
a few more questions
off-the-record.

753
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,955
Miss O'Neil, my record,
on-the-record...

754
01:00:03,032 --> 01:00:06,229
clearly shows that i have
no off-the-record record.

755
01:00:06,302 --> 01:00:09,465
- Make a record of that.
- Wait.

756
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:13,703
Were there any large tooth
or claw marks found here today?

757
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:15,710
How did you know...

758
01:00:16,579 --> 01:00:19,377
that i don't know
what you're talking about?

759
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:23,408
i have reason to believe
this damage was caused by two... two...

760
01:00:23,486 --> 01:00:26,182
really big animals.

761
01:00:26,255 --> 01:00:29,554
And what type of animals
might these be, Miss O'Neil?

762
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:32,117
- Well, i can't say exactly.
- I see.

763
01:00:32,195 --> 01:00:34,720
Then what leads you
to believe they did this?

764
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:37,857
i can't say that either, but...

765
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:40,732
Anything else you'd
like not to tell me?

766
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:43,966
Sterns, there are two very
dangerous things out there!

767
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:47,601
And just what exactly
would you like me to do about it?

768
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:53,415
i don't know.
i guess you're not the ones...

769
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,417
that are gonna have
to handle this.

770
01:00:56,252 --> 01:00:58,743
That's what we do best,
Miss O'Neil.

771
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:02,917
Have a nice day.

772
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:05,085
Get sanitation
down here.

773
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:07,391
Get this place
cleaned up.

774
01:01:13,269 --> 01:01:15,601
- Where's Freddy?
- He took off. Said he was sick.

775
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:18,698
- What do you need?
- Nothing. I can get it.

776
01:01:35,324 --> 01:01:37,349
Hello, April.

777
01:01:37,427 --> 01:01:39,292
Freddy?

778
01:01:41,798 --> 01:01:46,292
Our master has a message
for your friends.

779
01:01:56,245 --> 01:01:58,805
- Are you sure you weren't...
- They're not following me.

780
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:01,349
They don't need to.

781
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:06,982
They said
if you don't meet them...

782
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:10,924
at the construction
site tonight...

783
01:02:10,993 --> 01:02:13,018
What?

784
01:02:13,096 --> 01:02:15,860
he'd send Tokka
and Rahzar out again.

785
01:02:15,932 --> 01:02:17,866
This time
into Central Park.

786
01:02:17,934 --> 01:02:20,926
Oh, man! Central Park?

787
01:02:21,003 --> 01:02:26,236
How are they going
to avoid all those people?

788
01:02:26,309 --> 01:02:29,710
Then there is no choice...

789
01:02:29,779 --> 01:02:33,340
but to meet as
the Shredder wishes.

790
01:02:35,518 --> 01:02:36,951
He's just trying
to force you guys...

791
01:02:37,019 --> 01:02:39,920
- Into fighting Tokka and Rahzar again.
- We know.

792
01:02:39,989 --> 01:02:42,958
- You can't!
- April, there's no other way.

793
01:02:43,025 --> 01:02:46,961
- You guys don't stand a chance.
- Wait!

794
01:02:47,029 --> 01:02:50,590
Wait just a minute.

795
01:02:50,666 --> 01:02:52,657
There might be a way.

796
01:02:56,139 --> 01:02:59,233
- Temperature?
- 338 Kelvin.

797
01:02:59,308 --> 01:03:03,005
Michaelangelo, pass me
the dimethyl chlorinide.

798
01:03:03,079 --> 01:03:04,205
That.

799
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:07,738
You know, not to criticize
science or anything...

800
01:03:07,817 --> 01:03:11,651
but wouldn't it be easier
to call it "the pink one"?

801
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:18,218
Donatello,
continue aeration.

802
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:20,387
Continuing aeration.

803
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:25,127
Man!
This stuff is rank.

804
01:03:25,201 --> 01:03:27,795
Yeah, try carrying it
on the subway sometime.

805
01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:30,304
i never got a seat
so fast in my life.

806
01:03:31,507 --> 01:03:34,840
- Thanks for doing the shopping for us.
- No problem.

807
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:37,345
i hope you didn't mind me
picking up a few pies.

808
01:03:37,413 --> 01:03:39,506
You're forgiven.

809
01:03:49,192 --> 01:03:51,126
Are you sure
this stuff will work?

810
01:03:51,194 --> 01:03:54,493
When i contaminated the ooze
used to transform Tokka and Rahzar...

811
01:03:54,564 --> 01:03:57,362
making them intellectually inferior
and less dangerous...

812
01:03:57,433 --> 01:03:58,400
i had no idea...

813
01:03:58,467 --> 01:04:02,096
i'd be trying to create an anti-mutagen
based on that contamination.

814
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:05,299
Oh, anti-mutagen.

815
01:04:05,374 --> 01:04:07,308
- What?
- He's not sure.

816
01:04:09,378 --> 01:04:12,609
Pepperoni heaven!

817
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:15,549
Gentlemen, may i have
your attention?

818
01:04:15,618 --> 01:04:18,985
- Leonardo, hand me a glass, please?
- Oh, yeah. Sure.

819
01:04:19,055 --> 01:04:20,989
i got it.

820
01:04:21,057 --> 01:04:23,924
Are you sure this stuff
will do the trick?

821
01:04:23,993 --> 01:04:26,461
We won't know until
we spray those guys.

822
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:29,987
- Well, actually...
- "Actually" what?

823
01:04:30,066 --> 01:04:32,591
Actually...

824
01:04:32,668 --> 01:04:35,000
ingestion is
the only course.

825
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:38,234
- What?
- You mean, they have to eat it?

826
01:04:39,475 --> 01:04:40,737
Affirmative.

827
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:44,803
Yes. Right on, my man.

828
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:47,679
Great!
That should be easy.

829
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:49,843
Any ideas?

830
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:52,888
We could solidify it
in ice-cube trays.

831
01:04:52,955 --> 01:04:55,116
Well, i've got an idea.

832
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:17,645
Hey, is this gonna work?

833
01:05:17,713 --> 01:05:21,979
is, like, Schwarzenegger
hard to spell?

834
01:05:22,051 --> 01:05:23,177
Yeah.

835
01:05:33,629 --> 01:05:35,790
- Pretty quiet.
- Yeah.

836
01:05:35,865 --> 01:05:38,993
Shredder!

837
01:05:39,068 --> 01:05:42,196
Thanks, Raph. I may never
have the hiccups again.

838
01:05:52,248 --> 01:05:53,476
Welcome.

839
01:05:53,549 --> 01:05:55,483
All we need now is...

840
01:05:55,551 --> 01:05:59,317
- Wide World of Sports and a blimp.
- How ironic.

841
01:05:59,388 --> 01:06:01,879
The very thing
that was your making...

842
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:05,325
will now be your undoing.

843
01:06:05,394 --> 01:06:07,760
Tokka! Rahzar!

844
01:06:07,830 --> 01:06:11,425
Let the games begin!

845
01:06:25,081 --> 01:06:27,106
Watch out.

846
01:06:30,353 --> 01:06:33,220
What? Leo, come here!

847
01:06:35,091 --> 01:06:37,821
Come on! Go get 'em!

848
01:06:37,893 --> 01:06:38,917
Wait!

849
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:40,758
Wait!

850
01:06:42,164 --> 01:06:46,726
First we should observe
the ancient ritual of the...

851
01:06:46,802 --> 01:06:50,863
- Traditional pre-fight doughnut.
- Yeah.

852
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:52,464
Pre-fight doughnut?

853
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:03,876
- Why did i let you talk me into this?
- Give it a chance.

854
01:07:04,954 --> 01:07:07,252
Hi, guys.

855
01:07:07,323 --> 01:07:10,554
- It's not gonna work.
- Yes, it is. They'll eat anything.

856
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:19,058
Oh, yes!

857
01:07:22,171 --> 01:07:24,264
Nummers. Yeah.

858
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:26,467
Good boy.
A little drooly.

859
01:07:27,243 --> 01:07:29,837
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah! Good boy.

860
01:07:35,017 --> 01:07:37,781
- Yeah, right.
- Go on.

861
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:42,615
Here you go. Yeah.

862
01:07:42,691 --> 01:07:45,489
in your mouth.
Wolf it down! Scarf it!

863
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:49,520
- Have another.
- Eat it. Yeah. It'll be great!

864
01:07:58,074 --> 01:08:01,601
- They found the cubes.
- I told you it wasn't gonna work.

865
01:08:01,677 --> 01:08:03,201
Get them!

866
01:08:05,014 --> 01:08:06,447
i never touched it!

867
01:08:09,885 --> 01:08:13,343
Can't we talk this out?
No, wait! Wait!

868
01:08:16,692 --> 01:08:18,683
Major spin cycle!

869
01:08:23,899 --> 01:08:25,890
Hey, Leo!

870
01:08:25,968 --> 01:08:27,560
Mikey?

871
01:08:30,739 --> 01:08:34,675
Maybe i should've
brought bagels!

872
01:08:39,048 --> 01:08:41,676
Now i know what a postal
package feels like.

873
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:43,240
Hey, Mikey, you okay?

874
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:46,083
- You take the ugly one.
- No, you take the ugly one.

875
01:08:46,155 --> 01:08:49,682
- I'll take the ugly one!
- Which one's the ugly one?

876
01:09:05,674 --> 01:09:08,040
Get back! Go on! Go on!

877
01:09:08,110 --> 01:09:10,476
Hey, come here.

878
01:09:15,618 --> 01:09:17,552
You want some more?
Come on.

879
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:22,080
Look at those costumes!
i love this place!

880
01:09:23,459 --> 01:09:25,950
Hey, you!
Table for one!

881
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:40,035
Man, could this
get any worse?

882
01:09:42,545 --> 01:09:44,479
Oh, foul!

883
01:09:44,547 --> 01:09:46,412
Nasty!

884
01:09:47,316 --> 01:09:49,978
Hey, nice tie, bro.
Do you mind? Come on!

885
01:10:00,229 --> 01:10:02,459
Big brown ugly dude,
i'm over here.

886
01:10:02,531 --> 01:10:04,726
Try to get me.

887
01:10:06,735 --> 01:10:07,929
Yo, it's
the green machine

888
01:10:08,003 --> 01:10:10,403
Gonna rock the town
without bein'seen

889
01:10:10,472 --> 01:10:12,667
Have you ever seen
a turtle get down

890
01:10:12,741 --> 01:10:15,733
Slammin'and jammin'to the new
swing sound, yeah, everybody

891
01:10:15,811 --> 01:10:18,279
Let's move, Vanilla is here
with the NewJack groove

892
01:10:18,347 --> 01:10:22,579
Gonna rock and roll the place
with the power of the ninja turtle bass

893
01:10:22,651 --> 01:10:24,551
Iceman, you know
I'm not playin'

894
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:26,178
Devastate the show...

895
01:10:26,255 --> 01:10:29,383
- Professor!
- It would appear the anti-mutagen...

896
01:10:29,458 --> 01:10:32,359
- Has been somewhat ineffective.
- No kidding.

897
01:10:32,428 --> 01:10:34,692
We've gotta do something.
Come on.

898
01:10:34,763 --> 01:10:36,628
Go, ninja
Go, ninja, go

899
01:10:36,699 --> 01:10:38,667
Go, ninja
Go, ninja, go

900
01:10:38,734 --> 01:10:40,668
Go, ninja
Go, ninja, go

901
01:10:43,839 --> 01:10:46,740
What is this?
i didn't order any extras.

902
01:10:46,809 --> 01:10:48,606
- Did you order any extras?
- Well...

903
01:10:48,677 --> 01:10:50,941
Where did these
extras come from?

904
01:10:51,013 --> 01:10:53,573
Get me a phone.
i want the police. Now.

905
01:10:53,649 --> 01:10:56,140
Phone. Police.
Go! Hurry up!

906
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:58,653
Nice swing!

907
01:10:58,721 --> 01:11:01,383
This is bad.
Carbon dioxide...

908
01:11:01,457 --> 01:11:04,517
is essential to
the anti-mutanagenic process.

909
01:11:04,593 --> 01:11:08,427
Their burping is probably
retarding the reaction.

910
01:11:08,497 --> 01:11:10,590
isn't there any way
to speed it back up?

911
01:11:10,666 --> 01:11:15,069
The reintroduction of CO2
could act as a catalyst.

912
01:11:15,137 --> 01:11:18,629
- The problem is finding a ready supply.
- Yeah.

913
01:11:24,413 --> 01:11:27,507
Genius. Pure genius.

914
01:11:40,095 --> 01:11:43,360
i can't take this anymore!

915
01:11:43,432 --> 01:11:45,366
We should be out there
with the guys!

916
01:11:45,434 --> 01:11:49,700
No. You have youth.
i have experience.

917
01:11:49,772 --> 01:11:52,502
But only those
who now fight have both.

918
01:11:52,574 --> 01:11:56,340
- But i can fight.
- They fight because they must...

919
01:11:56,412 --> 01:12:00,178
but it is the last choice
for the true ninja.

920
01:12:00,249 --> 01:12:04,652
Used unwisely, it becomes
a double-edged sword.

921
01:12:05,721 --> 01:12:09,589
Look, i know you're trying to help me,
but you can't keep me here.

922
01:12:13,028 --> 01:12:15,053
i cannot.

923
01:12:24,073 --> 01:12:25,563
You sure about this,
Donny?

924
01:12:25,641 --> 01:12:29,042
- Don't worry. Just do it.
- Right.

925
01:12:29,111 --> 01:12:32,239
Come on, guys. Come on.

926
01:12:32,314 --> 01:12:33,747
Come on, come on.

927
01:12:36,151 --> 01:12:37,709
Over here, big guy.

928
01:12:37,786 --> 01:12:39,879
- Okay, Mikey?
- Yeah!

929
01:12:39,955 --> 01:12:41,547
Raph, now!

930
01:12:41,623 --> 01:12:43,318
Rock and roll!

931
01:12:47,129 --> 01:12:49,063
- Do it, Donny.
- Open wide!

932
01:12:49,131 --> 01:12:51,895
- Say "ahh."
- Go, ninja, go, ninja, go

933
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:53,798
Go, ninja
Go, ninja, go

934
01:12:53,869 --> 01:12:56,337
i think it's working!

935
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:05,009
These dudes are copping
major Z's already.

936
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:07,878
- All right!
- Yeah!

937
01:13:10,352 --> 01:13:11,284
What?

938
01:13:11,353 --> 01:13:13,913
- It's the police.
- The police? What are you doing?

939
01:13:13,989 --> 01:13:17,015
They like it.
They like it!

940
01:13:17,092 --> 01:13:21,028
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- It's okay. They like it.

941
01:13:21,997 --> 01:13:22,929
The Foot!

942
01:13:22,998 --> 01:13:25,466
it's party time, boys!

943
01:13:28,103 --> 01:13:31,072
i win. You lose.

944
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:33,938
It's the green machine gonna rock
the town without bein'seen

945
01:13:34,009 --> 01:13:36,102
Have you ever seen
a turtle get down

946
01:13:36,178 --> 01:13:38,237
Slammin'and jammin'
to the new swing sound

947
01:13:38,313 --> 01:13:41,009
One kick, two kick,
three kick, four!

948
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:44,052
We're gonna
rock and roll the place

949
01:13:44,119 --> 01:13:46,144
With the power of
the ninja turtle bass

950
01:13:46,221 --> 01:13:48,314
Iceman, you know
I'm not playin'

951
01:13:48,390 --> 01:13:50,483
Devastate the show
while the turtles are sayin'

952
01:13:50,559 --> 01:13:53,289
Ninja, ninja rap

953
01:13:55,364 --> 01:13:58,492
Wishbone crunch on two!
Hutt, hutt, wow!

954
01:13:58,567 --> 01:14:00,501
Villains, you better
run and hide

955
01:14:00,569 --> 01:14:01,968
Because one day
you might not slide

956
01:14:02,037 --> 01:14:04,972
So choose your weapon
Don't slip

957
01:14:10,379 --> 01:14:12,711
Yeah!

958
01:14:12,781 --> 01:14:16,444
Ninja, ninja, rap
Ninja, ninja, rap

959
01:14:16,518 --> 01:14:18,383
Go, go, go, go

960
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:20,513
Go, ninja
Go, ninja, go

961
01:14:20,589 --> 01:14:22,489
Go, ninja
Go, ninja, go

962
01:14:22,558 --> 01:14:24,583
Go, ninja
Go, ninja, go

963
01:14:24,660 --> 01:14:26,628
Go, ninja
Go, ninja, go

964
01:14:26,695 --> 01:14:29,562
Go, go, go, go

965
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:31,690
Go, go, go, go
Ninja, ninja go

966
01:14:31,767 --> 01:14:35,430
Sock it to me, baby!

967
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:39,066
My man!

968
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:41,939
Yeah!

969
01:14:42,010 --> 01:14:42,999
Wait!

970
01:14:43,078 --> 01:14:46,673
Go, go, go, go
Ninja, ninja, rap

971
01:14:46,748 --> 01:14:49,979
Ninja, ninja, rap

972
01:14:50,052 --> 01:14:52,452
We're shakin'! Yeah!

973
01:14:52,521 --> 01:14:54,682
You like what you saw?

974
01:14:54,756 --> 01:14:57,281
Then give it up
for us turtles!

975
01:14:57,359 --> 01:14:59,293
Go, ninja
Go, ninja, go

976
01:14:59,361 --> 01:15:00,919
Yeah!

977
01:15:00,996 --> 01:15:04,022
Ninja! Ninja!

978
01:15:12,207 --> 01:15:14,232
We're not through yet!

979
01:15:15,143 --> 01:15:17,703
just save yourself
the trouble, Shredder. It's all over.

980
01:15:17,779 --> 01:15:22,341
The battle is yours,
but the war is far from over.

981
01:15:22,417 --> 01:15:25,147
Not so long
as i possess this.

982
01:15:25,220 --> 01:15:27,188
The green stuff.

983
01:15:27,256 --> 01:15:29,724
- Hand it over, Shredder.
- Of course.

984
01:15:29,791 --> 01:15:34,228
in small doses
through future mutants.

985
01:15:34,296 --> 01:15:37,561
- You'll have to get through us first!
- Yeah!

986
01:15:37,633 --> 01:15:39,658
A pleasure.

987
01:15:40,569 --> 01:15:43,333
Guys, i'm here.
Get out of my way.

988
01:15:43,405 --> 01:15:46,272
- Get out! Watch out!
- Let us handle it, Keno.

989
01:15:50,612 --> 01:15:51,943
Let me go!

990
01:15:53,015 --> 01:15:54,744
Keno, stay back.

991
01:15:54,816 --> 01:15:56,681
- Raph, get on my back.
- Fool!

992
01:15:59,154 --> 01:16:02,248
- Back!
- You're not going anywhere, Shredder!

993
01:16:02,324 --> 01:16:04,918
On the contrary.
We're going somewhere.

994
01:16:04,993 --> 01:16:07,257
- Donny, come on!
- If you try to stop us...

995
01:16:07,329 --> 01:16:09,524
i'll cover her with this.

996
01:16:10,198 --> 01:16:11,961
Let me go.
i can take him! Come on!

997
01:16:12,034 --> 01:16:14,366
Full volume.

998
01:16:14,436 --> 01:16:16,427
Keno, it's not your fight.

999
01:16:16,505 --> 01:16:19,269
- Hit it, Mikey!
- Rock and roll!

1000
01:16:29,451 --> 01:16:30,884
is she all right?

1001
01:16:30,953 --> 01:16:34,684
- Keno, i told you...
- I know. This is not my fight.

1002
01:16:34,756 --> 01:16:36,781
- At last!
- Come on. Let's go.

1003
01:16:36,858 --> 01:16:39,622
- I'm coming.
- I learned that from a rat.

1004
01:16:39,695 --> 01:16:41,162
Later, Keno, dude!

1005
01:16:45,734 --> 01:16:48,828
Tokka and Rahzar.
How cute.

1006
01:16:48,904 --> 01:16:52,772
Hey. We could make
a fortune in the diet racket.

1007
01:16:52,841 --> 01:16:54,570
Oh, Mikey.

1008
01:16:55,677 --> 01:16:58,874
- Maybe he set a distance record.
- Doubtful.

1009
01:16:58,947 --> 01:17:00,881
Hey, where'd he go?

1010
01:17:05,487 --> 01:17:08,513
- Anything?
- Nothing.

1011
01:17:08,590 --> 01:17:12,583
Well, dudes, i'd say
that's pretty much a wrap.

1012
01:17:12,661 --> 01:17:15,323
Cowabunga?

1013
01:17:15,397 --> 01:17:17,524
- Cowabunga!
- Yeah!

1014
01:17:17,599 --> 01:17:19,863
Cowabunga!

1015
01:17:37,986 --> 01:17:43,390
- The last vial of ooze!
- He must have drank all of it.

1016
01:17:43,458 --> 01:17:46,052
it's a super Shredder.

1017
01:17:57,439 --> 01:18:00,431
Great! Now what
are we supposed to do?

1018
01:18:04,346 --> 01:18:08,043
This thing can't take much more of this,
not with all that stuff on top.

1019
01:18:10,952 --> 01:18:13,648
Shredder, you got
to listen to reason!

1020
01:18:13,722 --> 01:18:15,815
You're gonna
destroy us all!

1021
01:18:17,926 --> 01:18:20,156
Then so be it!

1022
01:18:21,096 --> 01:18:22,654
You okay?

1023
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:26,933
it's all coming down!

1024
01:18:27,002 --> 01:18:28,560
Watch your head, guys!

1025
01:18:30,405 --> 01:18:32,270
We're pancakes!

1026
01:18:36,178 --> 01:18:39,670
A true ninja is a master
of himself and his environment.

1027
01:18:39,748 --> 01:18:43,582
So don't forget.
We're turtles!

1028
01:19:28,196 --> 01:19:31,063
i've said it before,
and i'll say it again.

1029
01:19:31,133 --> 01:19:35,433
"Man, i love
being a turtle!"

1030
01:19:35,504 --> 01:19:38,200
- Too bad the Shredder can't say that.
- Yeah.

1031
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:41,465
- Look!
- Wha...

1032
01:19:41,543 --> 01:19:44,068
it can't be.

1033
01:19:44,146 --> 01:19:47,138
Nobody could
have survived that.

1034
01:19:52,387 --> 01:19:54,582
That's the end
of the Shredder.

1035
01:19:54,656 --> 01:19:57,557
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1036
01:19:57,626 --> 01:20:00,117
And in a bizarre
final note...

1037
01:20:00,195 --> 01:20:02,686
to the mysterious
disappearance of TGRI...

1038
01:20:02,764 --> 01:20:07,167
this message was delivered
to the station earlier today.

1039
01:20:07,235 --> 01:20:11,899
'"To Leonardo,
Michaelangelo, Raphael...

1040
01:20:11,973 --> 01:20:14,464
- And Donatello...
- Idiots.

1041
01:20:14,543 --> 01:20:18,274
thanks for
your help, dudes.

1042
01:20:18,346 --> 01:20:20,576
Signed,
ProfessorJordan Perry. "

1043
01:20:21,516 --> 01:20:24,349
Of course we can only
guess at its meaning.

1044
01:20:25,353 --> 01:20:26,843
And now this.

1045
01:20:30,559 --> 01:20:32,493
Bodacious!

1046
01:20:32,561 --> 01:20:35,962
- Ostentatious!
- Hey, hey, spacious!

1047
01:20:36,031 --> 01:20:38,864
Hey, dudes!
Cowabunga says it all!

1048
01:20:38,934 --> 01:20:41,732
Cowabunga!

1049
01:20:41,803 --> 01:20:43,737
Oh, yeah!

1050
01:20:44,806 --> 01:20:47,434
We're home.

1051
01:20:48,543 --> 01:20:50,602
Were you seen?

1052
01:20:50,679 --> 01:20:52,977
- Of course not, Master Splinter.
- We practice ninja.

1053
01:20:53,048 --> 01:20:55,141
The art of invisibility.

1054
01:20:59,521 --> 01:21:01,489
Practice harder.

1055
01:21:03,992 --> 01:21:06,927
Ten flips now!
And remember...

1056
01:21:06,995 --> 01:21:09,054
"Go, ninja
Go, ninja, go!"

1057
01:21:10,832 --> 01:21:12,766
i made another funny!
