You see, the problem with
this newspaper, Mr. Kemp,

113
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,172
is that I am among many
who don't enjoy reading it.

114
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:10,549
We have an ailing circulation,

115
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:12,259
and I just have to
look around this building

116
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:13,886
to understand why.

117
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,723
Lack of commitment and
too much self-indulgence.

118
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:19,600
Mmm. Mmm.

119
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:22,436
So what I'm looking for

120
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,563
is some enthusiasm,
some energy,

121
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:26,565
some fresh blood.

122
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:31,070
And the question
that I'm asking myself

123
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:33,364
is how much alcohol
is usual in yours.

124
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,032
My fresh blood?

125
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,408
How much do you drink?

126
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,286

anxious, Mr. Kemp.

00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,671
I'll take him up to Al's.

168

Oh, the hell you will.

169
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:14,923
You take him to the library.

170
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,133
You pull out some volumes.

171

a sense of the paper.

about horoscopes?

Nothing.

"Madam La Zonga Predicts."

Madam La Zonga?

191
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:55,255
He got canceled.

192

frequented by sailors

198

on the west side
of Candado Pier is one.

199

00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,285
What you got?

329
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:42,120
No, I mean at the bar.

330
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,458
Pointless.

331
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:50,045
I'd better go before
they wonder where I went.

332
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,299
Wait a minute.
What's your name?

333
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:56,760
Let's keep that a secret.

334
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,470
I don't even know it.

335
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,222
Well, then you'll
keep it even better.

336
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:01,807
What about your star sign?

337
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,975
I'm an experienced astronomer.

338
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,228
Could try Pisces.

339
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:07,938
The fish.

340
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,650
Oh, God.

341
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,902
Why did she have to happen?

342
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:17,113
Just when I was doing
so good without her.

343
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,700
KEMP: What would you say you
like most about Puerto Rico?

344
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:23,453
The bowling alleys
and the casinos.

345
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:25,539
Course, she likes
the duty free.

346
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:27,791
Well, the more you spend,
the more you save.

347
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,626
KEMP: Have you seen
a lot of the island?

348
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,128
We don't leave the hotel.

349
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:33,964
It isn't safe.

350
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:35,048
KEMP: But
you're having fun?

351
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,759
Oh, yeah!
A lotta, lotta fun!

352
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,680
KEMP: Have some fun
with a fucking Luger.

353
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:44,516
These alleys are magnets
to the glutton.

354
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:47,269
They come off the boats
like locusts.

355
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,439
Beasts of obesity.

356
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:53,984
Asses that wouldn't
feel an arrow.

357
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:57,612
The great whites.

358
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,490
Probably the most dangerous
creatures on Earth.

359
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:14,045
SALA:
There's your baby.

360
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,338
Walt and his woman.

361
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:18,216
Bowling alleys isn't exactly
what I had in mind.

362
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:19,885
Tread it till the snow melts,

363
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:21,386
then join the exodus.

366
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,390
LOTTERMAN:
Looking for Kemp.

367
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:29,728
Too many adjectives,
too much cynicism.

368
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,563
Nobody wants what's
wrong with the place,

369
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,106
they want to read about
what's right.

370
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,733
It's a rewrite.
Yeah, I'm aware of that.

371
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:36,484
And while you're at it,

372
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,570
you might want to rewrite
the title and call it

373
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,864
"Ten Things That I Love
About Puerto Rico."

374
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,329
So,

375
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:49,956
how's the sobriety
coming along?

376
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:52,250
I'm cutting down.

377
00:20:52,627 --> 00:20:55,629
Oh. By that, I assume you
mean the size of the bottles.

378
00:20:58,341 --> 00:21:01,509
How does anybody
drink 161 miniatures?

379
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,429
You're averaging
93 miniatures a week.

380
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,598
What, do they stock the
place four times a day?

381
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:07,849
Are they not complimentary?

382
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:09,267
No, Mr. Kemp,
they are not.

383
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:11,561
And neither is wine and
long-distance phone calls.

384
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:15,398
So, as of Monday, you are no
longer a resident of the Xanadu.

385
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:17,651
And what exactly brings
you into the building?

386
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:18,777
Don't hazel me.

387
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:21,655
I got the X-rays back.
I got less than a week to live.

388
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:24,282
LOTTERMAN: Hazel you?
What are you talking about, you Swedish twerp?

389
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:27,535
You know, it may have crossed
what's left of your mind

390
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,162
that I have a newspaper
to run here,

391
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:32,165
that we have something called
news going on out there.

392
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,792
But as far as you're concerned,

393
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:36,211
I might as well look out
of the fuckin' window!

394
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:38,129
What are you doing here?

395
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,297
This is a newspaper.

396
00:21:39,382 --> 00:21:40,465
There's nothing here for you.

397
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,425
Two of the best scoops
you ever had

398
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,094
came out of my brain.

399
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:46,054
And you better
moderate your language

400
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,347
or I'll go elsewhere.

401
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:48,556
Elsewhere where?

402
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,558
You couldn't get work
as a fly repellent.

403
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:52,310
You're worthless, Moburg.

404
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:54,312
The last onion in the jar.

405
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:56,523
Don't push me, Letterman.

406
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:57,983
I'm dangerous when pushed.

407
00:21:58,067 --> 00:21:59,693
Oh, I know why you're here.

408
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:01,236
It's payday. (LAUGHS)

409
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,320
But in your case,

410
00:22:02,405 --> 00:22:03,655
deferred on a permanent basis.

411
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:04,823
You're fired!

412
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:06,324
You can't fire me.

413
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:07,742
You owe me money.

414
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:10,328
And you better pay it,
or I'll come through the roof

415
00:22:10,413 --> 00:22:12,706
and turn this place
into an insurance claim.

416

LOTTERMAN:
Are you threatening me?

Hey, guys, let's take it easy.

418

Eat the death pill, Letterman!

Come on, we're walking.

422
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,427
Did you hear
what he said to me?

00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:27,178
This guy's my blood pressure.

424
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:28,763
This guy's going to kill me.

425
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:32,559
And I want the negative
of that picture destroyed!

426
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,396
I don't want that animal
in this building again.

427

He is hygienically
unacceptable.

428
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,233
Did you see the side
of his nose?

429
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,735
Blackheads like Braille.

430
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:43,653
They should have him put down.

He's out of here at the
earliest opportunity.

434
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:53,079
And the earliest opportunity

435
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,374
is you.

436
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:59,127
You understand
what I'm saying, Kemp?

437
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:01,046
I think I get the drift.

438
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,298
I want you to immerse
yourself into this paper,

439

'cause you got the talent and
I think you got the will.

You make it grow and you
grow right along with it.

441
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:10,680
I'm not best placed to do that.

442
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:12,474
You think it's my
intention to keep you on

this mayor guy ever shows up.

maybe we met on the plane.

some home truth.

00:38:50,412 --> 00:38:53,622
This paper's been on its knees to
a bank since the day it opened.

And like most every other
newspaper on Earth,

714
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:57,334
it's financed
by its advertising.

And without advertising, not
only is there no La Zonga,

716
00:38:59,713 --> 00:39:01,588
there's no paper
to put it in, so, thus,

00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:03,966
there are one or two things
that we don't write about.

such thing as a liberal.

Well, here's a fact for you.

808
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:05,726
76.4% of all Negroes
are controlled from Moscow.

That's why Castro gets
such an easy ride.

810
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:11,690
In my view, we ought to bomb
Cuba off the face of the Earth,

Okay.

827
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:55,859
Let me just start by saying

828
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:57,402
this is a purely
informal meeting.

829
00:44:57,487 --> 00:45:00,822
And, incidentally, you don't
worry about Letterman, okay?

830
00:45:00,907 --> 00:45:02,074
Letterman?

831

to do with The New York Times?

for the news.

834

some writing for us.

837
00:45:13,378 --> 00:45:14,544

838
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:15,921
About what?

839
00:45:16,005 --> 00:45:18,256
SANDERSON: In a sentence,
we want to set something up,

840
00:45:18,341 --> 00:45:20,425
and have the public
as our friends.

841
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:22,844
And there are a variety
of ways we can do that.

842
00:45:25,807 --> 00:45:26,890
Let me tell you how this kind

843
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:28,266
of thing works, Paul.

844
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:30,185
Suppose, by way of example,

845
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,562
you wanted to put up taxes
by five percent.

846
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:34,231
The smart way of doing it

847
00:45:34,315 --> 00:45:36,983
is to float the idea
of a ten percent hike.

848
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:39,694
Let them all shout about it,
get themselves in a fuss,

849
00:45:39,779 --> 00:45:41,029
then you offer concessions.

850
00:45:41,114 --> 00:45:43,073
"How about seven percent?"
"No way," they'll say.

851
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:48,578
"All right, let's stay friends
and make a compromise at five."

852
00:45:48,663 --> 00:45:49,663
Bingo.

853
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,081
They think they won something,

854
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:53,333
you get the five percent you
wanted in the first place.

855
00:45:53,418 --> 00:45:55,252
Same thing applies
to real estate.

856
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,421
You want to build five houses,

857
00:45:57,505 --> 00:46:00,006
you put in a planning
application for 50.

858
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:01,925
How many do you want to build?

859
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:03,176
None.

860
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:04,970
We want to build one hotel.

861
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,805
Well, looking
around this place,

862
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:08,682
I don't think
anyone would notice.

863
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:10,308

choked with hotels, but

everybody will be pleased
to compromise at one.

868

some clever writing

in various

872
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:32,622

inappropriate comment.

01:01:47,579 --> 01:01:48,871
Well, I'm afraid some
of us had to leave.

1136
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:50,873
But, Mr. Zimburger
you know.

1137
01:01:50,999 --> 01:01:53,542
And this is Mr. Green of First
National Maritime Bank.

1138
01:01:53,627 --> 01:01:54,627
You want some coffee?

1139
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:56,670
I think we should
move right along, Hal.

1140
01:01:56,755 --> 01:01:58,047
I gotta go.
Sure.

1141
01:01:58,131 --> 01:01:59,632
Sit down, Paul.

1142
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:02,176
As you may know,
Mr. Kemp,

1143
01:02:02,677 --> 01:02:05,221
the island is owned
by the U.S. government.

1144
01:02:05,305 --> 01:02:07,807
Part of it presently used as
a target range by the Navy.

1145
01:02:08,475 --> 01:02:10,184
We know from
internal sources...

1146
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:11,435
Is that what you're calling me?

1147
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:13,187
(MEN CHUCKLING)

1148
01:02:13,814 --> 01:02:16,399
...that the government is preparing
to relinquish the lease,

1149
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:18,359
and this place wakes up
as 32 square miles

1150
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:21,112
of magnificent and
untouched real estate.

1151
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:23,531
Knock your eyes out.

1152
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:25,783
No prettier beaches
in the Caribbean.

1153
01:02:26,368 --> 01:02:29,787
Orientated around one hell
of a beautiful marina.

1154
01:02:31,832 --> 01:02:32,998
Thought it was one hotel.

1155
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:34,583
We start with one hotel.

1156
01:02:34,668 --> 01:02:35,876
It's a foot in the door.

1157
01:02:35,961 --> 01:02:38,337
Once we're up and running,
we're servants of a market.

1158
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:40,965
Like here?
Like here.

1159
01:02:41,675 --> 01:02:43,259
You look worried,
Mr. Kemp.

1160
01:02:44,386 --> 01:02:46,220
He's not worried.

1161
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:47,596
Paul and I shared
a tricky little night.

1162
01:02:48,723 --> 01:02:50,266
Right, Paul?
Oh.

1163
01:02:50,642 --> 01:02:51,892
Neither of us got much sleep.

1164
01:02:51,977 --> 01:02:53,060
(CHUCKLES)

1165
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:54,979
I gotta go, guys.

1166
01:02:55,063 --> 01:02:57,022
Well, we'll leave
you gentlemen to it.

1167
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:58,649
Has Mr. Kemp
signed the papers?

1168
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:00,526
Doing that right now.

1169
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:03,529
What... What am I
actually signing?

1170
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:06,031
Just a confidentiality agreement,
affirmation of trust.

1171
01:03:06,116 --> 01:03:08,951
Just so we're all sitting
in the same Jacuzzi.

1172
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:12,246
In case a turd floats up,
if you know what I mean.

1173
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:18,002
Come on, Paul,
let's go over here.

1174
01:03:22,549 --> 01:03:23,966

1176
01:03:25,552 --> 01:03:27,219
it's just a technicality, Paul.

1177
01:03:27,304 --> 01:03:30,931
Means you promise not to talk
to anybody about the project.

1178
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:32,475
How's the head?

1179
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:33,934
Unpleasant.

1180
01:03:34,561 --> 01:03:36,395
Gotta thank you again
for putting up the bail.

1181
01:03:36,897 --> 01:03:38,856
It's held on my cognizance.

1182
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:42,359
And I think it more than
likely to slip various minds.

1183
01:03:43,195 --> 01:03:45,613
This place is a sea
of money, Paul.

1184
01:03:45,864 --> 01:03:47,615
Unbelievable money.

1185
01:03:48,533 --> 01:03:51,410
Practically every major corporation
hides its cash offshore.

1186
01:03:51,536 --> 01:03:52,828
No, thanks.

1187
01:03:52,913 --> 01:03:55,414
And that is good news for us,

1188
01:03:55,916 --> 01:03:58,250
because we are the shore.

1189
01:03:59,753 --> 01:04:02,171
Not one dollar that wings
its way into Puerto Rico

1190
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:03,756
pays a cent in tax.

1191
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:05,758
Nothing?
Not penny one.

1192
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:07,051
That includes
chemical companies,

1193
01:04:07,135 --> 01:04:08,677
oil companies,
mining companies.

1194
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:10,763
There's $12 billion
worth of copper

1195
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:13,265
in mountains less than
20 miles from here.

1196
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:15,726
A dozen billion dollars.

1197
01:04:18,438 --> 01:04:20,439
And there's people like me

1198
01:04:20,774 --> 01:04:22,816
who know how to get it out.

1199
01:04:24,736 --> 01:04:27,446
So, putting it into context,

1200
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:29,782
I don't envisage
the breaking of bones

1201
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:31,450
to get at a thousand bucks.

1202
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:34,828
Because you weren't here,

1203
01:04:34,913 --> 01:04:37,331
I agreed to an itinerary with
Zimburger on your behalf.

1204
01:04:37,415 --> 01:04:40,960
You'll be traveling down in the morning.
Hope that's okay.

1205
01:04:45,799 --> 01:04:47,758
What do you need, Paul?

1206
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:51,303
Well, just in the context
of this Zimburger thing,

1207
01:04:51,388 --> 01:04:54,473
do you think there's a
possibility of an advance?

1208
01:04:55,475 --> 01:04:57,726
I don't like to ask, but
Letterman's pretty erratic

1209
01:04:57,811 --> 01:04:59,311
with the paycheck, you know.

1210

Need to get a hold of a car.

1211

You don't have a car?

1212
01:05:01,982 --> 01:05:03,691
Nothing too reliable.

1213
01:05:03,775 --> 01:05:06,151
Plus, sooner or later, I'm gonna
have to find a decent place to live.

Well, we can
help you with that.

have in the garage?

1618
01:35:15,794 --> 01:35:17,127
That's not what I heard.

1619
01:35:17,212 --> 01:35:19,380
I heard you were in the
moonlight for Sanderson.

1620
01:35:19,464 --> 01:35:20,506
I was what?

1621
01:35:20,590 --> 01:35:21,965
Moonlighting for Sanderson.

1622
01:35:22,050 --> 01:35:23,050
Where's Segurra?

1623
01:35:23,134 --> 01:35:24,468
Mr. Segurra's
no longer with us.

1624
01:35:24,552 --> 01:35:25,552
I got a story for you.

1625
01:35:25,637 --> 01:35:28,389
Yeah, you may have noticed
that I'm somewhat busy.

1626
01:35:28,473 --> 01:35:32,309
This is real important, involving
Mr. Segurra and Mr. Hal Sanderson.

1627
01:35:32,394 --> 01:35:33,894
I'm gonna tell you
how important it isn't.

1628
01:35:33,978 --> 01:35:36,814
I got 21 jobs on the line
and a newspaper going under.

1629

Print this, and you'll sell it.

of a paradise.

into the sea like garbage.

it's what it's doing to you.

wrong with a journalist.

with this insult of a newspaper.

Unanimously agreed.

Why don't you shut it, Moburg?

1644

Don't be sorry.

promise to you, the reader.

01:37:54,244 --> 01:37:56,828
And I don't know if I
can fulfill it tomorrow

or even the day after that.

1662

But I put the bastards
of this world on notice.

1663
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:07,089
That I do not have their
best interests at heart.

1664
01:38:08,883 --> 01:38:11,301
I will try and speak
for my reader.

1665

That is my promise.

1666

And it will be a voice
made of ink and rage.

Sit down.
I made you coffee.

start the day with this.

What is it?
It's a writ.

Means we're going to court.

1673

Uh... it's Hal.
