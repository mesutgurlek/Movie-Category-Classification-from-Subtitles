1
00:00:01,681 --> 00:00:03,202
Since I was currently homeless,

2
00:00:03,306 --> 00:00:06,482
Turk and Carla were letting me crash here 
as long as I needed.

3
00:00:06,651 --> 00:00:08,066
J.D., you have to get out.

4
00:00:08,276 --> 00:00:09,585
This place is tiny!

5
00:00:09,674 --> 00:00:12,026
And I'm sick of seeing your man-panties hangin' 
all over the bathroom.

6
00:00:12,314 --> 00:00:13,497
They're called boxers, Carla.

7
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:15,114
They're <i>satin</i>, J.D.?

8
00:00:15,393 --> 00:00:17,210
With a breathable cotton crotch panel!

9
00:00:17,324 --> 00:00:17,730
King me!

10
00:00:18,874 --> 00:00:20,953
Ugh, I need to find someone 
to split the rent at my place.

11
00:00:21,412 --> 00:00:22,534
I thought you were getting good money 

12
00:00:22,607 --> 00:00:23,499
at your new fellowship?

13
00:00:24,663 --> 00:00:26,817
So first, my fellowship gets canceled

14
00:00:26,874 --> 00:00:29,218
because some jackass cures the disease,

15
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:31,017
and now the only job I can get

16
00:00:31,089 --> 00:00:32,265
is working at this crappy free clinic

17
00:00:32,346 --> 00:00:33,474
for eight bucks an hour. 

18
00:00:33,602 --> 00:00:35,208
No one's life could be worse than mine!

19
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,417
Uh...the...fellowship's great! Heh!

20
00:00:40,706 --> 00:00:42,377
Oh God, Carla, please don't tell them

21
00:00:42,457 --> 00:00:43,745
I'm working at a free clinic!

22
00:00:44,114 --> 00:00:45,859
I sense she doesn't want me to tell them. 

23
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:47,456
Women have an unspoken connection 

24
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:49,172
men can't even fathom!

25
00:00:49,594 --> 00:00:51,767
Dude, I know you can't look because Carla's here,

26
00:00:51,848 --> 00:00:54,539
but you're missing a crazy Victoria's Secrets commercial.

27
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,917
I'm watching Giselle in my spoon right now!

28
00:00:59,827 --> 00:01:00,470
You know...

29
00:01:00,557 --> 00:01:02,708
you--you two could solve both of your problems

30
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:03,837
if you just moved in together.

31
00:01:04,261 --> 00:01:07,756
- Whooooooa. Hold your horses! 
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, and whoa-ho!

32
00:01:07,862 --> 00:01:09,796
We have a very complicated past.

33
00:01:10,005 --> 00:01:11,565
Yeah, I hurt her, and I'm not proud.

34
00:01:11,694 --> 00:01:12,669
I'm a little proud.

35
00:01:12,764 --> 00:01:15,988
We've managed to restore our friendship, 
though, by staying away from dangerous topics.

36
00:01:16,558 --> 00:01:18,956
Yeah, relationships, and things of that nature.

37
00:01:19,055 --> 00:01:20,318
J.D. and I keep it superficial.

38
00:01:20,405 --> 00:01:21,485
Love the superficial.

39
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,654
Dynamite teeth today!

40
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:24,597
Oh, thanks, buddy!

41
00:01:24,669 --> 00:01:25,565
Sparkly!

42
00:01:27,357 --> 00:01:30,278
Fine, you can't live with Elliot! But you're not living with us, 

43
00:01:30,371 --> 00:01:31,452
so get your crap out by Friday.

44
00:01:31,533 --> 00:01:32,076
Friday?

45
00:01:32,157 --> 00:01:32,539
Friday.

46
00:01:32,613 --> 00:01:33,805
Friday's my birthday!

47
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,990
I've already e-vited everyone to a party at our place.

48
00:01:36,325 --> 00:01:36,917
Whose place?

49
00:01:36,997 --> 00:01:38,142
Your place.

50
00:01:38,916 --> 00:01:40,924
Look, I can't just un-e-vite everyone

51
00:01:41,004 --> 00:01:43,700
I've already got two e-yeses and twenty-four e-maybes.

52
00:01:43,764 --> 00:01:45,190
 That's a lot of e-sponses.

53
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,286
Bambi, I'm gonna put my e-foot up your ass.

54
00:01:47,453 --> 00:01:49,518
 It's a Mexican-themed fiesta.

55
00:01:49,604 --> 00:01:52,364
on the first anniversary of my 29th birthday.

56
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:54,044
That means I'm turning thirty!

57
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:57,141
<i>Donde ?</i> 56 Wallnut Drive.

58
00:01:57,254 --> 00:01:59,445
<i>Cuando ?</i> Thank you for asking

59
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:02,077
<i>ocho</i>-thirty until upside-down question mark.

60
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:03,242
Sombreros at the door.

61
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:06,428
I'll be there.

62
00:02:06,557 --> 00:02:07,446
Gracias amigo.

63
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:09,642
I borrowed one of your dictionaries!

64
00:02:10,498 --> 00:02:12,507
Since there were twelve surgical residents at Sacred Heart

65
00:02:12,587 --> 00:02:14,652
fighting for four attending spots, 

66
00:02:14,786 --> 00:02:16,819
Turk was ass-kissing the senior staff.

67
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:18,763
Oh, damn, 

68
00:02:18,843 --> 00:02:20,404
I left my briefcase upstairs.

69
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:21,954
'Scuse me a second!

70
00:02:22,147 --> 00:02:23,954
Turk thought he was the only one who heard that.

71
00:02:25,306 --> 00:02:27,058
Docteur Wen, docteur Wen !

72
00:02:27,156 --> 00:02:28,561
DR. WEN! DR. WEN! I'VE GOT YOUR BR--

73
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:30,698
He was not.

74
00:02:35,591 --> 00:02:38,494
I had no idea that there was 
that many Asian surgeons in this hospital..

75
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:39,816
I got your back, T-Dog.

76
00:02:41,455 --> 00:02:42,774
Then let it begin.

77
00:03:29,383 --> 00:03:31,583
Quit fooling around with those guys and get down here!

78
00:03:35,902 --> 00:03:37,902
Here comes the big dog!

79
00:04:06,983 --> 00:04:08,983
Dude, thanks for having my back.

80
00:04:09,623 --> 00:04:11,512
Yeah. Betrayal five.

81
00:04:17,145 --> 00:04:17,824
Hey, buddy.

82
00:04:17,871 --> 00:04:18,407
Hey!

83
00:04:18,782 --> 00:04:20,255
Betrayal five.

84
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:22,959
DR. WEN!

85
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:25,176
Oh, my briefcase!

86
00:04:25,238 --> 00:04:25,807
Y eah!

87
00:04:26,069 --> 00:04:28,180
You know, I totally saw that coming.

88
00:04:30,397 --> 00:04:32,773
Episode 5x03 : "My day at the races"

89
00:04:32,852 --> 00:04:35,397
By z.e.k

90
00:04:35,461 --> 00:04:39,132


91
00:04:39,188 --> 00:04:42,508
Pour [Scrubs-fr.net] et Forom.com

92
00:04:44,526 --> 00:04:46,142
Dude, look at you! Thirty years old

93
00:04:46,526 --> 00:04:47,499
all growed up!

94
00:04:47,573 --> 00:04:48,073
Oh, really, Turk?

95
00:04:48,322 --> 00:04:50,034
Because the Sacred Heart sign 

96
00:04:50,106 --> 00:04:52,099
I vandalized last night begs to differ!

97
00:04:52,363 --> 00:04:55,323


98
00:05:02,801 --> 00:05:04,330
Hey! Remember when we were in college 
and we made lists of all the stuff 

99
00:05:04,403 --> 00:05:06,210
we wanted to do by the time we turned thirty?

100
00:05:06,275 --> 00:05:06,746
Yeah!

101
00:05:06,803 --> 00:05:07,715
Check it!

102
00:05:07,883 --> 00:05:08,947
"Things to do by thirty:

103
00:05:09,035 --> 00:05:12,898
Get married. Buy a house. 
Learn difference between senator and congressman."

104
00:05:13,003 --> 00:05:14,362
Dude, you haven't done any of these yet.

105
00:05:14,442 --> 00:05:15,636
I know! But who cares? 

106
00:05:15,698 --> 00:05:17,106
I got all the time in the world. 

107
00:05:17,171 --> 00:05:18,514
I mean, I'm only turning thirty.

108
00:05:18,586 --> 00:05:21,649
Thirty? No one's thirty.

109
00:05:21,714 --> 00:05:24,354
Where did all these unsupervised children come from?

110
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,092
So you wanted to talk to me about your appendectomy, Mrs...

111
00:05:30,787 --> 00:05:34,299
Appendectomy? Now that ain't right!

112
00:05:34,587 --> 00:05:38,313
Look, fifteen percent of all surgical complications are anesthesia-related, 

113
00:05:38,395 --> 00:05:41,610
so I would like to use hypnosis instead of the traditional anesthesia.

114
00:05:41,954 --> 00:05:44,530
Well, I'd like to sleep with Beyoncé instead of my wife tonight, 

115
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:45,811
but that ain't happening either,

116
00:05:45,891 --> 00:05:47,234
you know what I'm saying!? 

117
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:50,114
Tell you what, I'll think about it.

118
00:05:50,586 --> 00:05:52,411
My appendectomy patient 

119
00:05:52,476 --> 00:05:54,440
wants me to use hypnosis instead of anesthesia.

120
00:05:54,523 --> 00:05:57,658
Lookit, I'd like to throw it in Gwen Stefani tonight instead of Jordan, 

121
00:05:57,723 --> 00:05:59,242
but  that ain't gonna happen either.

122
00:05:59,313 --> 00:06:00,099
Dr. Cox!

123
00:06:00,162 --> 00:06:03,538
Dr. Cox! No! Awful!

124
00:06:03,849 --> 00:06:05,986
Hypnosis  is a very powerful tool.

125
00:06:06,049 --> 00:06:08,499
It's helped people with depression and weight loss 

126
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:09,457
it helped me quit smoking.

127
00:06:09,754 --> 00:06:12,531
Hypnosis is for birthday parties and bad Vegas lounges. 

128
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:15,650
Now, you go tell your patient to let you do what you do best: 

129
00:06:15,715 --> 00:06:17,548
Knock her out, and then start digging around 

130
00:06:17,609 --> 00:06:20,290
inside of her like a blind man looking for a nickel.

131
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:21,258
I think you should do it.

132
00:06:21,322 --> 00:06:22,122
Knock her out and dig.

133
00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:22,449
Do it.

134
00:06:22,505 --> 00:06:22,778
Dig.

135
00:06:22,843 --> 00:06:23,153
Do it.

136
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:23,547
Dig.

137
00:06:23,603 --> 00:06:27,770
Okay.... I'm gonna go with Dr. Cox on this one.

138
00:06:27,993 --> 00:06:29,402
That's a rookie move, and you hate to see it.

139
00:06:29,467 --> 00:06:35,234
You always side with the wife
even if she's got a full-blown case of the crazies.

140
00:06:37,715 --> 00:06:39,730
Turk! We're gonna have kids soon. 

141
00:06:39,855 --> 00:06:41,487
We're supposed to be a team! 

142
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,472
That means you occasionally have to listen to me 
and believe in my opinion!

143
00:06:45,945 --> 00:06:46,912
Like, what if we have a daughter 

144
00:06:46,982 --> 00:06:48,514
and she wants to get her ears pierced?

145
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:50,609
Irrelevant. We're not having a daughter.

146
00:06:50,683 --> 00:06:53,527
Okay. What if we have a son and he wants to take dance class, 

147
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,888
even though all his friends are playing football?

148
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:00,112
He can dance if he wants to.... He can leave his friends behind.... 

149
00:07:00,984 --> 00:07:02,913
"'Cause his friends don't dance,

150
00:07:02,984 --> 00:07:05,833
and if they don't dance, then they're no friends of mine!"

151
00:07:11,224 --> 00:07:13,561
So then I said, "What if our son wants to take dance class 

152
00:07:13,623 --> 00:07:15,568
instead of play football with his friends?" 

153
00:07:15,671 --> 00:07:18,457
and Turk ran off singing "Safety Dance."

154
00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:21,577
Carla, didn't you learn your lesson 
that time you told him the commissar was in town?

155
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:22,697
Yeah....

156
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,503
Ooh! Someone's leaving!

157
00:07:28,304 --> 00:07:29,816
We saw it first! 

158
00:07:30,497 --> 00:07:31,816
Jordan, here's the plan:

159
00:07:31,905 --> 00:07:34,496
I'm gonna go ahead 

160
00:07:34,551 --> 00:07:37,024
and cram an entire evening's worth of drinking into the next five minutes. 

161
00:07:37,086 --> 00:07:40,222
Now, you just make sure not to engage them. 

162
00:07:40,295 --> 00:07:41,807
Be particularly aware of the blonde talky one

163
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,015
I've worked with her before

164
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:44,560
she has no off button.

165
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:47,071
If money is so tight, 
why not have Jake move in with you?

166
00:07:47,152 --> 00:07:48,544
Who's Jake?

167
00:07:48,607 --> 00:07:51,304
Jordan! ...Non!

168
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,854
He's this guy that I've been going out with for a while, 

169
00:07:53,926 --> 00:07:55,159
but we're not ready to move in. 

170
00:07:55,231 --> 00:07:56,655
He's a little closed-off, you know?

171
00:07:57,104 --> 00:07:59,696
Uh, sweetie, are you aware of who I live with?

172
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,702
Jordan Godzilla Sullivan! 
You stop that, and you stop it now!

173
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:05,118
Why don't you try 

174
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:06,368
talking to humans for once? 

175
00:08:06,432 --> 00:08:07,728
You might enjoy it!

176
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:10,912
Elliot, maybe you should be the one to open Jake up?

177
00:08:11,006 --> 00:08:13,975
You know like Turk can be a little...immature

178
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,222
you know, like I always have to talk about my feelings over dinner

179
00:08:17,287 --> 00:08:18,959
or shut off his iPod during sex. 

180
00:08:19,035 --> 00:08:20,211
I bet you could do the same thing with Jake.

181
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:24,013
Or...maybe you could pressure him, get dumped,

182
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,188
throw on fifty pounds,

183
00:08:25,228 --> 00:08:28,405
start collecting knick-knacks 
and meet your future now.
 
184
00:08:28,461 --> 00:08:30,708
You know...before the loneliness burns too much? 

185
00:08:34,485 --> 00:08:37,254
Gosh, I did enjoy that!

186
00:08:39,596 --> 00:08:41,516
Dude, you haven't done anything on this list!

187
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,309
 How could you never've slept naked on a hammock?

188
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,861
I'm afraid of dragonflies. 

189
00:08:45,461 --> 00:08:47,108
You know what, I'm not gonna make a big deal out of this.

190
00:08:47,172 --> 00:08:49,012
Neither one of us has made any headway with our lists.

191
00:08:49,252 --> 00:08:51,077
 First of all, don't lump me in with you

192
00:08:51,141 --> 00:08:52,764
'cause I'm a surgeon, I'm married, 

193
00:08:52,845 --> 00:08:54,044
I've had sex while playing Frogger, 

194
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,405
and I'm gonna be a dad

195
00:08:55,469 --> 00:08:56,582
I'm moving through my list.

196
00:08:56,662 --> 00:08:57,725
I've done nothing.

197
00:08:57,803 --> 00:08:59,126
I mean, I did learn another language,

198
00:08:59,189 --> 00:09:03,684
but it was just that one where you put a "b" sound in the middle of every single word -- and I was never fluent.

199
00:09:04,013 --> 00:09:05,307
That secret language was so lame.

200
00:09:05,428 --> 00:09:07,534
Nobot with the labadabies!

201
00:09:08,655 --> 00:09:10,205
Dr. Kelso !

202
00:09:10,891 --> 00:09:11,878
Do you have any idea 

203
00:09:11,949 --> 00:09:13,701
who's gonna get those three attending spots next year?

204
00:09:13,796 --> 00:09:15,596
There are four spots for next year.

205
00:09:15,685 --> 00:09:17,525
Three if you're not counting the one going to me!

206
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:19,187
I'm gonna stick with four, Turkleton.

207
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:23,100
See, there are numerous skilled surgeons here at Sacred Fart

208
00:09:25,626 --> 00:09:27,337
did you see the sign? 

209
00:09:28,282 --> 00:09:30,946
Though there will be no vandalism here, people! 

210
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:33,489
It was classic! 

211
00:09:33,856 --> 00:09:37,352
Anyway, 
the key is doing something to get noticed.

212
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:38,375
I don't know if you know this, 

213
00:09:38,447 --> 00:09:40,590
but tomorrow I'm doing an appendectomy 

214
00:09:40,678 --> 00:09:42,744
using hypnosis instead of anesthesia.

215
00:09:42,823 --> 00:09:44,383
Well, it's about time. 

216
00:09:44,657 --> 00:09:48,239
Hell's bells, son, when I say the name Turkleton, people laugh!

217
00:09:48,344 --> 00:09:50,344
Maybe because that's not my name.

218
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,703
Not yet, Turkleton! Not yet.

219
00:09:57,391 --> 00:09:59,467
 Elliot, I don't think I understand what you want.

220
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,414
I just want you to open up, you know,

221
00:10:02,517 --> 00:10:05,237
emotionally...spiritually....

222
00:10:05,589 --> 00:10:07,390
Uh, I'm not exactly religious, you know

223
00:10:07,508 --> 00:10:10,116
but I-I do think that God watches after my family

224
00:10:10,181 --> 00:10:12,430
and...well, my favorite sports teams. 

225
00:10:12,701 --> 00:10:14,956
Oh, and once in tenth grade, 
He made Jennifer Martin sleep with me.

226
00:10:15,004 --> 00:10:16,302
Okay! 

227
00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:18,438
How about opening up sexually? 

228
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:21,206
What's your wildest fantasy?

229
00:10:21,284 --> 00:10:22,309
Yeah...it's not happening.

230
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:23,327
Come on!

231
00:10:23,741 --> 00:10:26,285
Sometimes in bed, I feel like I'm the only one screamin'!

232
00:10:26,381 --> 00:10:28,117
Elliot, you're quiet as a mouse

233
00:10:28,199 --> 00:10:29,493
all the screaming is in your head.

234
00:10:29,918 --> 00:10:32,052
Yeah, but in there, it's crazy...

235
00:10:34,011 --> 00:10:36,714
 All right, fine, 
 why don't you tell me your--your wildest fantasy.

236
00:10:36,785 --> 00:10:37,771
Okay, fine.

237
00:10:38,786 --> 00:10:40,610
You're a Mexican apple thief,

238
00:10:40,693 --> 00:10:41,867
I run the cider house;

239
00:10:41,946 --> 00:10:43,945
I catch you hiding behind the stonemill, 

240
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,892
you chase me into the tasting room

241
00:10:45,994 --> 00:10:48,825
oh, if there's a crow in there, fine, 
if not...I can live with it.

242
00:10:49,267 --> 00:10:51,961
Anyway, we're all alone,
you don't speak a word of English,

243
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,290
but you teach me more about hard cider 

244
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:56,881
than I ever learned from my fermenting exams.

245
00:10:57,011 --> 00:10:58,554
And our passion is so loud 

246
00:10:58,643 --> 00:11:01,082
that they can hear it all the way in the distillery!

247
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:06,954
Oh...heh. God, I can be such an apple slut! Heh.

248
00:11:07,922 --> 00:11:08,602
'Kay...

249
00:11:12,635 --> 00:11:14,146
When did we lose Mr. Heath?

250
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:16,395
Oh, we didn't. His vitals are fine.

251
00:11:17,483 --> 00:11:19,895
Doug, I told you to stop pre-tagging patients.

252
00:11:20,228 --> 00:11:22,926
It's a slow day in the morgue. 
Nothing's written in stone!

253
00:11:23,388 --> 00:11:24,629
You wrote a time of death!

254
00:11:24,741 --> 00:11:26,789
I wrote "one-<i>ish</i>"!

255
00:11:27,214 --> 00:11:28,556
Get outta here!

256
00:11:29,205 --> 00:11:30,693
Why are you so pissy?

257
00:11:30,837 --> 00:11:34,356
Carla, at 6:41 tomorrow evening, I turn thirty. 

258
00:11:34,436 --> 00:11:36,853
I have to find one thing on this list I can do by then.

259
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,158
Maybe you could swing by our parts department 

260
00:11:39,235 --> 00:11:40,750
and pick up a pair of testes?

261
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,829
Haven't you used that joke like a trillion times?

262
00:11:43,422 --> 00:11:44,333
I'm okay with it.

263
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:45,900
"Invent  a cereal"? 

264
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:47,861
"Complete a triathlon"?

265
00:11:47,933 --> 00:11:50,068
There's a, uh, triathlon tomorrow.

266
00:11:50,134 --> 00:11:52,870
Thing One and Thing Two have been training vigorously for it.

267
00:11:52,948 --> 00:11:54,580
We're working on our drafting technique!

268
00:11:55,036 --> 00:11:57,525
If your goal is to repel all women on the planet, 

269
00:11:57,589 --> 00:11:58,804
then it's definitely working.

270
00:11:58,887 --> 00:12:00,517
Ignoring him.... 

271
00:12:00,948 --> 00:12:02,116
And switch!

272
00:12:03,005 --> 00:12:04,453
That's it! I'll do the triathlon!

273
00:12:04,518 --> 00:12:06,726
Oh, you don't know anything about triathlons!

274
00:12:06,802 --> 00:12:08,116
Well, I didn't know anything 

275
00:12:08,182 --> 00:12:09,902
about cereal inventing, either, Carla

276
00:12:10,134 --> 00:12:13,149
And yet if it wasn't for a certain 
harshly-worded cease and desist letter, 

277
00:12:13,237 --> 00:12:15,094
we'd all be eating J.D.'s Bananas & Nuts.

278
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:17,021
You're not serious about this, are you?

279
00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:22,205
Why  is everybody wearing wetsuits?

280
00:12:22,301 --> 00:12:24,871
This water's like forty-nine degrees, dumb-dumb!

281
00:12:26,431 --> 00:12:28,502
So what's your best time, buster?

282
00:12:28,741 --> 00:12:30,366
Honestly, Ted, it doesn't really matter.

283
00:12:30,462 --> 00:12:32,501
As long as I finish by 6:41 tonight.

284
00:12:32,573 --> 00:12:37,333
The harder you push yourself to do something, 
the harder it is to back out.

285
00:12:37,455 --> 00:12:40,142
Whether you're caught in a lie with your wife...

286
00:12:40,196 --> 00:12:42,167
I heard you were doing the hypnosis surgery. 

287
00:12:42,213 --> 00:12:44,485
You actually listened to me!

288
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:46,620
Hell yeah, I listened to you...baby, come on!

289
00:12:46,711 --> 00:12:49,140
That's the reason why I'm doing it, right?

290
00:12:49,221 --> 00:12:51,221
'Cause of you and how well I listen.

291
00:12:51,326 --> 00:12:51,933
I love you.

292
00:12:51,997 --> 00:12:53,028
I love you.

293
00:12:53,213 --> 00:12:55,055
Or whether you're just trying to get your boyfriend to open up.

294
00:12:55,118 --> 00:12:58,022
Come on, Jake! Come in there 
and show me what you're really like! 

295
00:12:58,085 --> 00:13:00,180
No one is gonna judge you.

296
00:13:07,966 --> 00:13:09,813
Oh my God, Jake!

297
00:13:09,877 --> 00:13:10,990
You wanna talk about it, Elliot?

298
00:13:11,046 --> 00:13:11,887
Nope !

299
00:13:11,943 --> 00:13:13,628
And sometimes, the only thing you can do 


300
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:14,971
is just dive in.

301
00:13:25,014 --> 00:13:26,477
Oh, Jehovah, that's cold! 

302
00:13:26,604 --> 00:13:27,861
Oh, God, why! 

303
00:13:28,238 --> 00:13:31,060
There's a little...here's some more.

304
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,294
All right, ease it in...ease it in!

305
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:40,765
As I side-stroked through the salty waters 
of the great Pacific

306
00:13:40,927 --> 00:13:41,997
pick an apple,

307
00:13:42,077 --> 00:13:42,957
put it in your pocket;

308
00:13:43,038 --> 00:13:43,638
pick an apple,

309
00:13:43,701 --> 00:13:44,580
put it in your pocket;

310
00:13:44,798 --> 00:13:46,325
I wondered if everyone 

311
00:13:46,396 --> 00:13:47,741
was doing as well as I was.

312
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:49,847
Why are all these cameras here?

313
00:13:50,007 --> 00:13:52,342
Turkleton,
Turkleton, this is quite the event here at Sacred Fart. 

314
00:13:54,571 --> 00:13:56,579
I can't help it, it kills me! 

315
00:13:56,962 --> 00:13:58,537
Yeah, we got visiting doctors, 

316
00:13:58,610 --> 00:13:59,787
video crews,

317
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,331
even that Japanese newsanchor 

318
00:14:01,403 --> 00:14:02,028
who slept with me

319
00:14:02,097 --> 00:14:04,443
when I convinced her I was an oil tycoon.

320
00:14:04,507 --> 00:14:06,411
If she comes over here, my name is T-Bone!

321
00:14:07,155 --> 00:14:10,931
We're also getting a good bit of interest from the seismologists at CalTech,

322
00:14:11,013 --> 00:14:15,042
who I understand will be able to chart the magnitude of the scream

323
00:14:15,107 --> 00:14:17,307
emanating from your hypnosis patient,

324
00:14:17,378 --> 00:14:21,746
as well as, of course, the numerous afterscreams that are sure to follow.

325
00:14:23,698 --> 00:14:25,074
No interviews!

326
00:14:26,659 --> 00:14:27,675
Turk?

327
00:14:27,778 --> 00:14:29,188
Turk, where are you going?

328
00:14:29,258 --> 00:14:30,337
Honey, I can't do this.

329
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:31,942
I don't believe in any of this hypnotism crap.

330
00:14:32,303 --> 00:14:33,725
I only needed to impress Kelso.

331
00:14:33,784 --> 00:14:35,182
Oh, so great, you lied to me.

332
00:14:35,736 --> 00:14:36,900
I'm about to ruin my career

333
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,900
by plunging a knife 

334
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,504
into a completely conscious person!

335
00:14:40,686 --> 00:14:42,024
But you know what, you're absolutely right
336
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,288
let's focus on the lying.

337
00:14:47,728 --> 00:14:49,103
As  I reached the biking stage 

338
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:51,140
and finally realized what chafing was, 

339
00:14:51,195 --> 00:14:52,411
I got a surprise visitor.

340
00:14:54,048 --> 00:14:55,279
How's it goin'?

341
00:14:55,543 --> 00:14:57,424
Well, my bike is rusty,

342
00:14:57,512 --> 00:15:00,432
I haven't been able to feel my genitals 
since they first touched water,

343
00:15:00,826 --> 00:15:03,496
and the only thing I've had to eat all day
is a half a jellyfish. 

344
00:15:03,712 --> 00:15:04,543
Why are you here?

345
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,983
Can I talk to you about Jake?

346
00:15:06,055 --> 00:15:07,270
It's a dangerous topic. Talk to Carla.

347
00:15:07,335 --> 00:15:10,175
Yeah, anytime I talk to Carla about a guy, 

348
00:15:10,249 --> 00:15:12,263
she tells me to marry him so the four of us 
can go to dinner together.

349
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,786
I've been dating this guy for a few weeks,

350
00:15:13,864 --> 00:15:14,944
but I just found out

351
00:15:15,024 --> 00:15:16,087
that he went on a gay cruise last month.

352
00:15:16,168 --> 00:15:17,188
Probably a cheap trick.

353
00:15:17,253 --> 00:15:18,004
Marry him,

354
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:19,000
the four of us'll have dinner.

355
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:20,000
But he also said he might be gay!

356
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:21,032
Dinner!

357
00:15:21,263 --> 00:15:22,208
Talking to you about Jake 

358
00:15:22,264 --> 00:15:24,631
violates the two most important tenants of our relationship. 

359
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:27,536
One: Keep discussion superficial.

360
00:15:27,607 --> 00:15:31,792
And Two: No talking while my boys are straddling chrome. 

361
00:15:31,993 --> 00:15:32,888
That one's new.

362
00:15:32,984 --> 00:15:35,161
Why don't you just try a higher gear?

363
00:15:35,241 --> 00:15:38,873
It's like pedaling in hummus!

364
00:15:38,943 --> 00:15:40,425
See ya, buddy!

365
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:42,751
Oh, merci mon Dieu !

366

00:15:42,832 --> 00:15:44,655
Oh, thank God! I think the bike part's finally over!

367
00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:46,816
Oh, no!

368
00:15:53,537 --> 00:15:55,208
I can play with signs, too!

369
00:15:57,161 --> 00:15:58,121
This is great. 

370
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,295
I'm being assisted by a magician.

371
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,777
The only way you're gonna get through this 
is if you believe it's gonna work.

372
00:16:03,888 --> 00:16:04,976


373
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,464
That was just a fingernail, honey!

374
00:16:08,543 --> 00:16:11,121
How would you like it if I cut out your appendix?!

375
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,208
Let's forget for one second

376
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:15,008
that hypnosis is used to lower bleeding,

377
00:16:15,071 --> 00:16:15,967
aid recovery,

378
00:16:16,047 --> 00:16:17,208
or help patients deal with pain.

379
00:16:17,272 --> 00:16:18,303
You are married now. 

380
00:16:18,423 --> 00:16:20,679
So start believing what I tell you to believe!

381
00:16:21,294 --> 00:16:22,697
And DON'T PINCH ME!

382
00:16:24,697 --> 00:16:27,855
During the eight-mile run, dehydration set in.

383
00:16:27,937 --> 00:16:29,343
Hang in there, buddy!

384
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:30,975
See you at the luau!

385
00:16:34,383 --> 00:16:36,529
They already finished and cooked a pig?

386
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:38,281
Hey, J.D.

387
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:41,616
Ahh, you're real.

388
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,305
Although the dolphin costume's a little odd.

389
00:16:44,856 --> 00:16:46,776
This Jake thing is still really bothering me.

390
00:16:46,848 --> 00:16:48,024
Elliot, you know our rules.

391
00:16:48,121 --> 00:16:49,721
Yeah, I've been thinking about that.

392
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:51,649
Who wants to have a superficial friendship?

393
00:16:51,785 --> 00:16:54,032
I mean, God, do you remember how close we used to be?

394
00:16:54,223 --> 00:16:55,641
Dealing with Dr. Cox, 

395
00:16:55,727 --> 00:16:58,240
dealing with our screwed-up families, talking about everything?

396
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,911
I miss that.

397
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:01,695
This is working.

398
00:17:01,809 --> 00:17:02,888
Not for me! 

399
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,879
I wanna be able to tell you

400
00:17:03,952 --> 00:17:05,495
that my boyfriend really freaked me out.

401
00:17:05,594 --> 00:17:07,313
Well, if he freaked you out, 
why don't you go talk to him?

402
00:17:07,422 --> 00:17:08,808
 I don't know!

403
00:17:08,857 --> 00:17:10,279
You tell me.

404
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,334
All right, fine, Elliot. 

405
00:17:13,383 --> 00:17:14,448
You wanna know why? 

406
00:17:14,543 --> 00:17:15,728
You're just like me. 

407
00:17:15,824 --> 00:17:19,217
You're scared because you feel like you haven't accomplished anything with your life. 

408
00:17:19,392 --> 00:17:21,041
But instead of running a triathlon, 

409
00:17:21,128 --> 00:17:23,284
you're pushing forward with a guy you don't belong with.

410
00:17:24,021 --> 00:17:25,790
And you know as well as I do, one of these days 

411
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:27,460
he's gonna open up a bottle of white wine for you 

412
00:17:27,543 --> 00:17:29,510
when you really prefer red, 

413
00:17:29,565 --> 00:17:30,430
except you never told him that; 

414
00:17:30,502 --> 00:17:31,669
and you wanna know why?

415
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,983
 It's because he's not right for you, Elliot. 


416
00:17:34,485 --> 00:17:36,156
Are you happy now?

417
00:17:36,485 --> 00:17:39,253
You're pretty smart for a guy running in bike shoes.

418
00:17:40,907 --> 00:17:43,862
Must...finish...race.

419
00:17:44,318 --> 00:17:47,333
You can do this. You can do this.

420
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,100
What are you saying to her?

421
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,928
"You can do this. You can do this."

422
00:17:53,511 --> 00:17:54,673
Small world.

423
00:17:54,736 --> 00:17:56,488
Scalpel.

424
00:17:57,753 --> 00:17:59,193
Making first incision.

425
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:06,127
Well, here goes....

426
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,305
All right!
Clamp, please!

427
00:18:18,157 --> 00:18:21,045
They say that, in life, all good things must come to an end.

428
00:18:23,229 --> 00:18:24,845
Sometimes it comes quietly.

429
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,246
I like red.

430
00:18:27,654 --> 00:18:29,246
You do?

431
00:18:29,637 --> 00:18:32,743
Jake...I think we need to talk.

432
00:18:35,182 --> 00:18:37,222
And sometimes, not so quietly.

433
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:38,246
You can do this...

434
00:18:38,766 --> 00:18:40,341
Oh-b, no-b.

435
00:18:40,396 --> 00:18:43,549
You can do this! You can do this! You can do this! You can do this! 

436
00:18:46,142 --> 00:18:47,301
And suddenly, 

437
00:18:47,365 --> 00:18:49,030
you realize you've taken something 

438
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:50,861
as far as it can go.

439
00:18:55,671 --> 00:18:57,230
What the hell was I thinking?

440
00:18:57,318 --> 00:18:59,222
No, you did great, baby.

441
00:18:59,326 --> 00:19:00,685
She's right, Turkleton.

442
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:03,655
Hell, without anesthesia, 
you made it halfway through a surgery. 

443
00:19:03,797 --> 00:19:05,046
I bet you could publish that.

444
00:19:05,109 --> 00:19:07,500
Maybe they'll put it in Almost Magazine.

445
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,596
You know, Perry, 

446
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,907
it wouldn't hurt you to make some noise around here.

447
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:14,341
How's this? Blow it out your ass, Bob.

448
00:19:15,095 --> 00:19:17,541
See? My baby made some noise!

449
00:19:17,611 --> 00:19:19,540
Yeah, I made some noise, all right.

450
00:19:22,295 --> 00:19:23,342
J.D.,

451
00:19:24,478 --> 00:19:26,165
what you said before...

452
00:19:26,238 --> 00:19:27,303
I knew you were right. 

453
00:19:28,045 --> 00:19:29,902
Anyway, I'm sorry I got mad.

454
00:19:30,621 --> 00:19:32,191
...

455
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:34,102
Thanks. 

456
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,310
You were wrong about one thing, though

457
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,037
we are moving forward.

458
00:19:39,093 --> 00:19:40,735
Elliot, I'm thirty years old; 

459
00:19:40,815 --> 00:19:41,596
I'm single, 

460
00:19:41,678 --> 00:19:42,597
I'm homeless, 

461
00:19:42,686 --> 00:19:44,782
and I'm pretty sure I just soiled myself.

462
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:46,607
Why don't you just move into my place?

463
00:19:46,758 --> 00:19:47,830
Oh, great, 

464
00:19:47,894 --> 00:19:50,078
then we'll be two losers under one roof.

465
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:53,542
By my watch, we've got eight minutes to finish this thing. 

466
00:19:53,646 --> 00:19:54,351
Come on.

467
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:55,958
A wise man once said 

468
00:19:56,032 --> 00:19:58,246
the human spirit can overcome any obstacle.

469
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:59,558
I can't.

470
00:19:59,600 --> 00:19:59,900
Come on!

471
00:20:00,861 --> 00:20:02,662
That man had obviously never run a triathlon.

472
00:20:05,742 --> 00:20:06,769
You're not really helping!

473
00:20:09,996 --> 00:20:11,827
Are you sure this is the finish line?

474
00:20:16,059 --> 00:20:17,322
I think I see him.

475
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:19,363
As for me,

476
00:20:19,412 --> 00:20:21,107
I could overcome any obstacle, 

477
00:20:21,172 --> 00:20:24,836
as long as I had Elliot and her ridiculously strong thighs beneath me.

478
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:35,443
We made it! 

479
00:20:35,548 --> 00:20:38,057
And with--and with two minutes to spare!

480
00:20:45,476 --> 00:20:47,338
Baby, I'm not carrying 'em to the car.

481
00:20:50,309 --> 00:20:52,386
Promise to help me get through my thirtieth?

482
00:20:53,571 --> 00:20:55,170
Will you tell me what Jake's fantasy was?

483
00:20:55,244 --> 00:20:55,916
Nope.

484
00:20:56,042 --> 00:20:57,058
Did it involve chains?

485
00:20:57,114 --> 00:20:57,596
No.

486
00:20:57,668 --> 00:20:58,067
Whips?

487
00:20:58,147 --> 00:20:58,595
