1
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:13,950
Nurse Evelyn! Nurse Evelyn!

2
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:17,818
I have a message for you. In English!

3
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,605
And here we go.

4
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:42,080
Now, look, here's the list of all the patients
we've had in the ward in the last month.

5
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:50,617
Thank you, Nurse.

6
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,958
- You're Alexandria?
- Yes.

7
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:05,259
Your note came in, and landed on my lap.

8
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:07,561
Couldn't even understand it.
It's written in gibberish or something.

9
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:12,366
You didn't understand it, didn't you,
didn't understand it, it's not for you.

10
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:18,233
My name's Roy.

11
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,880
- How'd you hurt your arm?
- I fell.

12
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,139
Me too.

13
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,083
I was picking oranges.

14
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:30,854
Is that so?

15
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,361
How do you go to the potty?

16
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:38,488
I don't. They let me go right here.

17
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:41,294
- In bed?
- Yeah, it's true.

18
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:42,959
I don't believe.

19
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,104
Hey, Alexandria.

20
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:50,734
Hey, do you know
you're named after Alexander the Great

21
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,608
who was the greatest warrior
who ever lived?

22
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:57,445
Yes. And my note is not in gibberish.
It's in English!

23
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:59,985
Hey, I can see you. Come on out here.

24
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:03,788
I can see you hiding.

25
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:06,455
Alexandria.

26
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:13,996
Hey, did you know
he was also looking for a message?

27
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,403
<i>He was lost.</i>

28
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:26,701
<i>He almost died, separated from his army.</i>

29
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:31,415
- Did he find the message?
- What?

30
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:35,147
Did she find the message?
Alexandria the Great.

31
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:37,951
All right, right, I'll tell you,
just come in here.

32
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,359
Now, come on, grab that chair right there.

33
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:47,892
All right, don't break your other arm.

34
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,266
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

35
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,413
- What's in your box?
- Things I like.

36
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:08,716
- Things you stole?
- No.

37
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:11,688
A photo.

38
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,320
Where'd you get the elephant?

39
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:18,795
My friend gave it to me at work.

40
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:22,794
He's from India.

41
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:28,239
Look, this is my horse

42
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:33,202
- and this is my father.
- Yeah?

43
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,708
He's got the same gap in his teeth,
must run in the family.

44
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:40,445
- Yeah, and here is my house.
- Oh, yeah?

45
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,045
- It was my house.
- What happened?

46
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:45,682
- They burn it.
- Who burned it?

47
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:48,092
Angry people.

48
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:51,520
I'm sorry to hear that.

49
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:54,629
I said, I'm sorry to hear that.

50
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:56,795
Angry people.

51
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,667
Yeah, I know,
I'm just sorry that your house got burned.

52
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:01,969
Why did Alexander

53
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:07,138
didn't go from that buildings on his horse?

54
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,546
- If him was lost...
- What?

55
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:16,612
Why did Alexander didn't go
from that middle of the buildings

56
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:19,749
from that buildings on his horse?

57
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,391
Well...

58
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:30,560
<i>First of all, he didn't have a horse</i>
<i>because his horse was killed in a battle.</i>

59
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:36,137
<i>And he wasn't</i>
<i>in the middle of any old buildings.</i>

60
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:42,579
<i>He was lost in the middle of a vast desert,</i>
<i>full of orange sand</i>

61
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:44,673
<i>with only a handful of men</i>

62
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:49,421
<i>but they didn't have any water.</i>

63
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:13,303
Look!

64
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:42,304
<i>"My Lord, all hope is lost.</i>

65
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:46,243
<i>"It seems your mighty army</i>
<i>shall finally be conquered.</i>

66
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:51,648
<i>"Not by the Persians, but by our own greed</i>
<i>and gluttony for water.</i>

67
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:54,709
<i>"This helmet contains our last supply.</i>

68
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:59,521
<i>"Oh, King,</i>
<i>I believe your wisdom shall save us all. "

69
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:10,466
- Why?
- Why?

70
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:11,628
What?

71
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,131
Why?

72
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:19,775
Well, because there wasn't
enough water for all of them

73
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:22,370
and it was Alexander the Great's way

74
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:25,008
of showing his army
that they were all equal...

75
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:26,915
It's stupid.

76
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:28,351
What would you do better?

77
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:30,981
Was Alexander throw the water

78
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:35,824
instead to give every soldier a little bit.

79
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,531
Hey, why don't you come back tomorrow
and I'm going to tell you a different story.

80
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:49,438
An epic tale of love and revenge.

81
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:51,806
- You know what "epic" means?
- No.

82
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:54,107
I still got this tightness here.
It's like I can't even...

83
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,513
It means a really long story,
and it's set in India.

84
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:58,982
...the elephant sitting on my chest.

85
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,985
- You should be fully recovered.
- All right, go on.

86
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,987
- I want you to examine me.
- Will you come back tomorrow?

87
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,819
You personally. I'm not very well.

88
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:15,661
The swelling seems down.

89
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:19,828
I know how much it hurts.

90
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,142
A sense of humor.

91
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:29,477
In the next couple of weeks the pain
should abate, then one more operation.

92
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:31,311
Like the last one?

93
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:34,375
This is going to take some effort
on your part, too, you know that?

94
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:35,579
See?

95
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:24,959
Come on, then.

96
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,752
- Be back before lunch.
- Okay.

97
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,938
Alexandria, get away from that ice.

98
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:13,007
I see you licking that ice,
you're gonna get sick.

99
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:15,053
I want you to go play, go!

100
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,248
Next time, I'll glue your lips to this
and carry you away.

101
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:27,322
You're lucky it was just a horse
that got killed.

102
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:31,426
I mean, jumping off a train bridge
was suicide, too.

103
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:33,562
And if you were trying to impress her...

104
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,600
Sinclair already did a better job.

105
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:39,439
You know, the actor,

106
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:43,638
- the leading man.
- I know who he is.

107
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:47,986
Every cloud has a silver lining,
that's for sure.

108
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,111
Take another card.

109
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:51,782
- You know, before my accident...
- That is the Queen of Hearts.

110
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:53,188
...nothing was happening for me.

111
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:56,888
Now I've had my leg hacked off by savages,

112
00:14:56,962 --> 00:15:00,728
mangled by chariots,
sawed off by lumberjacks.

113
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:04,929
Hell, I've even had a harpoon through it.
I'm working all the time.

114
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:11,803
That is the two of spades.

115
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:14,846
- The studio is just trying to do right by you.
- Excuse me, Mr. Sabatini.

116
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,041
Take the money.

117
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:20,415
Anyway, gags are not for you, Roy.

118
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:21,783
You're a college man.

119
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:22,878
Wasn't me.

120
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:24,650
One cripple to another...

121
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,052
I didn't throw orange at you.

122
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:30,220
...no woman is worth suicide.

123
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,655
Like the guy's a movie star, for chrissake.

124
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,679
Was your friend a pirate?

125
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,150
Was your friend a pirate?

126
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:00,223
Sometimes.

127
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:05,092
Is that how he hurt his leg?

128
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:09,260
No, he... He does tricks for pictures.

129
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:12,133
You know, flickers.

130
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:14,104
Moving pictures.

131
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:18,168
- I never seen one.
- You're not missing much.

132
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:22,039
Is that what you do, like your friend?

133
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:25,282
Just once.

134
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:31,420
Will you tell me the story now?

135
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:35,016
- What story?
- The epic.

136
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:40,229
All right.

137
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:44,659
All right, close your eyes.

138
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:49,065
What do you see?

139
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:51,770
Nothing.

140
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:55,910
Rub them.

141
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,412
Can you see the stars?

142
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:02,183
<i>Yes.</i>

143
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:05,515
<i>It was a starry night.</i>

144
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:10,324
<i>Four men waited impatiently</i>
<i>on a small island</i>

145
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:13,388
<i>surrounded by a calm sea.</i>

146
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:16,662
<i>But that calmness was deceptive.</i>

147
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:23,837
<i>For at that moment</i>

148
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:28,346
<i>an Indian with a bandaged thigh</i>
<i>swam towards them.</i>

149
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:36,812
Tell me, Indian.

150
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,280
Is it true?

151
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:46,487
Luigi, is what true?

152
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:51,660
Governor Odious will execute
your twin brother tomorrow morning.

153
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,634
My poor brother.

154
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:03,781
<i>In all, there were five of them.</i>

155
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:06,511
<i>They had only one thing in common,</i>

156
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,520
<i>a hatred of Governor Odious.</i>

157
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:15,822
<i>The first was an ex-slave, Otta Benga.</i>

158
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:27,061
<i>He and his brother were born into slavery</i>

159
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:31,269
<i>only to fill the coffers</i>
<i>of the evil Governor Odious.</i>

160
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:37,212
<i>One day while toiling in the fields...</i>

161
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:55,329
<i>Heartbroken at his brother's death,</i>
<i>he freed the slaves</i>

162
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,803
<i>and swore that he would be responsible</i>
<i>for Governor Odious's death.</i>

163
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:04,908
<i>I like him.</i>

164
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:08,276
<i>Then, there was the Indian,</i>

165
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:12,181
<i>who, whenever anxious,</i>
<i>always stroked his brow.</i>

166
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:23,118
<i>The Indian was supposedly married</i>
<i>to the most beautiful squaw in the world</i>

167
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:25,857
<i>yet nobody had seen her.</i>

168
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:30,368
<i>To verify this,</i>
<i>Odious disguised himself as a leper</i>

169
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:34,428
<i>but when he saw her reflection,</i>
<i>he was smitten.</i>

170
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:43,278
<i>Locking the doors to his wigwam,</i>
<i>the Indian stood guard.</i>

171
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:47,341
<i>Little did he know,</i>
<i>he was guarding an empty home</i>

172
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:52,356
<i>for his wife had already been kidnapped</i>
<i>by the evil Governor Odious.</i>

173
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:57,122
<i>But the squaw refused</i>
<i>to show herself to him.</i>

174
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:01,098
<i>So, Odious had her thrown</i>
<i>into the Labyrinth of Despair.</i>

175
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:09,835
<i>Eventually she realized</i>
<i>there was only one way out.</i>

176
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:27,283
<i>While mourning his wife's death</i>

177
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:30,920
<i>the Indian took a blood oath</i>
<i>never to look at another squaw</i>

178
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:34,830
<i>and that he would be responsible</i>
<i>for Governor Odious's death.</i>

179
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:41,096
<i>I like him, too.</i>

180
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:45,302
<i>Luigi was an explosive expert.</i>

181
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,074
<i>When Odious heard</i>
<i>about the power of his new bombs,</i>

182
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:53,379
<i>he had him publicly banished.</i>

183
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:58,282
<i>On his return, Luigi discovered</i>
<i>that everybody hid from him</i>

184
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:02,760
<i>because even speaking to him</i>
<i>was punishable by death.</i>

185
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:07,195
<i>But when his own priest refused</i>
<i>to hear his confession,</i>

186
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:14,195
<i>Luigi swore that he would be responsible</i>
<i>for Governor Odious's death!</i>

187
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:22,273
<i>Next was the English naturalist</i>

188
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,910
<i>Charles Darwin.</i>

189
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:29,181
<i>He loved all living things,</i>

190
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:34,157
<i>creatures, plants, everything alive.</i>

191
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:40,161
<i>Darwin was always accompanied</i>
<i>by his shy, brilliant colleague,</i>

192
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:41,460
<i>Wallace the monkey.</i>

193
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:43,057
What is that, Wallace?

194
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:47,432
I don't know why flamingos are pink.

195
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:51,442
<i>Even though they had developed</i>
<i>many theories together</i>

196
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:55,039
<i>they were still looking for something.</i>

197
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:59,083
<i>- What?</i>
<i>- Butterfly.</i>

198
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:02,115
<i>That's a good guess.</i>

199
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:06,984
<i>In fact, a very specific butterfly</i>

200
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:10,460
<i>called</i> Americana Exotica.

201
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:15,298
<i>One day, Odious sent them a dead one.</i>

202
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:23,334
<i>Butterfly Reef.</i>

203
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:30,737
<i>This Odious, it's bad man?</i>

204
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,279
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

205
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,244
<i>Butterfly Reef.</i>

206
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:41,055
<i>That's where Governor Odious</i>
<i>chose to banish our heroes,</i>

207
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:43,961
<i>to mock them,</i>

208
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:50,291
<i>hoping that in their fight for survival</i>
<i>they would devour each other.</i>

209
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:54,997
<i>So, the buccaneers</i>
<i>were trapped on this island.</i>

210
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:56,938
<i>What means a buccaneer?</i>

211
00:22:57,843 --> 00:23:02,507
<i>Well, it's like a pirate. Pirate and buccaneer,</i>
<i>it's like the same thing.</i>

212
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:04,981
But I don't like pirate stories.

213
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:09,750
You're the one who asked for a pirate story.

214
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:12,187
- No.
- Yes, you did.

215
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:18,052
I just wanted to know
if your friend was a pirate.

216
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:21,896
- Why?
- Because he has just one leg.

217
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:24,696
Oh, right.

218
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:30,470
Well, yeah, it's not a pirate story.
It's a story about bandits.

219
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:34,538
<i>In fact, our masked hero</i>
<i>couldn't even swim.</i>

220
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,239
I need to learn to swim.

221
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:47,454
Finally, very little was known about
the gap-toothed Masked Bandit.

222
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:50,653
<i>- Like my father?</i>
<i>- Yes, your father.</i>

223
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:56,958
<i>Except that he and his twin brother,</i>
<i>the Blue Bandit,</i>

224
00:23:57,035 --> 00:24:00,801
<i>had escaped execution</i>
<i>from the Spanish Governor Odious.</i>

225
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,867
<i>Knowing that their chances of survival</i>
<i>were better apart</i>

226
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:08,435
<i>the two brothers separated</i>

227
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:11,971
<i>swearing that</i>
<i>they would kill Governor Odious.</i>

228
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,847
We must conceive a plan!

229
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:23,652
I need to get off this island,
and rescue my twin brother.

230
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:33,036
What? What?

231
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:37,101
All elephants?

232
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:49,481
I say, we...

233
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:57,751
I have an idea.

234
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:34,998
Darwin! That was a great idea!

235
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,850
Come on, Otta Benga!

236
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:10,331
Goodbye, my beautiful friend!
Have a nice swim!

237
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:20,308
Darwin, you are a genius!

238
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:21,868
Much obliged!

239
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:24,415
Where do you get these ideas?

240
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:05,253
What is it, my friend?

241
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:54,033
How sad. The tortures of this world
have driven the poor man mad.

242
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:56,874
Not true.

243
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:59,842
He said he has been sent by his mystic cult

244
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:06,011
to help us against Governor Odious
and his Spanish henchmen.

245
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:13,749
This region was once a lush forest
alive with birds and sacred trees

246
00:28:17,562 --> 00:28:19,689
but Odious had them all burned down.

247
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:25,134
He also says the birds are safe
inside his belly

248
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:28,900
but we must take care
for only the fittest shall survive.

249
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:32,033
Tell him we have no use of a mystic.

250
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,380
We are on a dangerous mission.

251
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:42,813
We need to hurry to the fort
to save my twin brother.

252
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,946
He will only slow us down.

253
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:51,957
Fish, <i>señor!</i>

254
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,216
Stand aside, my friend.

255
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:32,320
Before you say kaboom,
I have this door open.

256
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:19,667
Forgive me, wise mystic, for my disrespect.

257
00:31:19,744 --> 00:31:23,271
Undoubtedly, you have a flair
for war-mongering.

258
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:28,952
It would be my honor
if you consider joining us

259
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,487
on our quest.

260
00:31:33,758 --> 00:31:35,851
We must save your brother!

261
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,169
First,

262
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:51,766
a little test.

263
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,574
You can't stop there.

264
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:58,446
I just wanna play a little game. I want you
to go outside and touch one of my toes.

265
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:02,213
No, tell me the story.
What happened with the Blue Bandit?

266
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:03,982
It won't take long.

267
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:07,218
- Just go outside and touch one of my toes.
- Okay.

268
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:14,589
- I'm touching your little toe.
- No!

269
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:18,830
Please don't tell me
which toe you're touching. I gotta guess.

270
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:21,838
That's the whole point of the game.
All right.

271
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:23,567
I'm touching one.

272
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:30,878
I'm touching one.

273
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:35,111
You're touching my big toe?

274
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:40,382
Are you telling the truth?

275
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,892
Look.

276
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:51,629
Really.

277
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:55,401
Oh, I got that?

278
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,236
What happened?

279
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,208
What happened with his brother?
Did he save him?

280
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:02,144
No, no, no, no. Were you telling a story?

281
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:06,216
No, no, no.
Were you telling the truth just now?

282
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:09,412
No. I was telling the truth.

283
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,648
No. You just said no,
you weren't telling the truth.

284
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:13,315
No, I tell you it.

285
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:16,019
- Were you telling the truth?
- Yeah.

286
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:18,324
When you just touched my toe?

287
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:23,398
- You little liar.
- No.

288
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,263
Alexandria, were you lying to me?

289
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:31,938
I touch your big toe.

290
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:35,405
We need to hurry!

291
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:39,172
Do you want me to finish the story?

292
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:44,314
<i>The Masked Bandit arrived</i>
<i>at the Chandelier Hall too late.</i>

293
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:49,753
<i>Odious had already</i>
<i>tortured his brother and crew</i>

294
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:51,317
<i>and hung them.</i>

295
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:14,246
All right, that's it! It's not a circus.
It's not a playground for all your...

296
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:16,684
Please! Are you listening to me?

297
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:18,847
Get out of here!

298
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,483
- You leave her alone.
- Come here, baby.

299
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,356
Get off! Goddamn!

300
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:29,399
No, no, no, sweetheart, come here,
come here. Come on.

301
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:28,253
Dad?

302
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:30,954
- Dad? Dad?
- I'm not feeling real well.

303
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:32,188
- What do you want?
- He's doing it again.

304
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:34,322
Will you stop that? Leave him alone!

305
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:06,828
- What's that?
- Food.

306
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:09,264
- Where'd you get it?
- The chapel.

307
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:16,999
I'm sorry I shouted at you.

308
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,602
I was angry.

309
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,043
No problem.

310
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:27,039
Are you trying to save my soul?
Are you trying to save my soul?

311
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,720
- Do you understand me?
- What?

312
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:34,917
- Did you understand what I meant?
- What you said?

313
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:37,756
I said, are you trying to save my soul?

314
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:41,023
- Giving me that.
- What mean that?

315
00:36:41,098 --> 00:36:43,396
The Eucharist. It's a...

316
00:36:44,802 --> 00:36:46,030
What?

317
00:36:46,103 --> 00:36:49,300
The Eucharist.
The thing you gave me. It's a...

318
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:52,138
It saves your soul.

319
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:56,302
The thing I gave to you, what?

320
00:36:56,380 --> 00:37:00,316
The little piece of bread
that you just gave me.

321
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,113
It saves your soul.

322
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:06,345
- What? What? What?
- Are you worried about me?

323
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:09,052
Saves your soul.
Do you know what "soul" means?

324
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:11,617
- No.
- It's like strength.

325
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:18,865
Why does the old man
keep his teeth in a glass at night?

326
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:25,368
It's where he keeps his strength, his spirit.

327
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:30,269
His spirit is in those teeth.

328
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:34,545
Yeah.

329
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:37,811
Oh, you're missing a little strength

330
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:41,457
right in the front of your mouth.

331
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:46,922
The chapel's in the main block, isn't it?

332
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:49,523
Yes. What happened with the Black Bandit?

333
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,202
I'm sorry.

334
00:37:55,172 --> 00:37:56,503
It's okay.

335
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:03,040
They keep the medicine in the main block,
don't they?

336
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,376
Yes.

337
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:28,765
That which has been taken from me
can never be replaced.

338
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:31,966
My brother...

339
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:34,876
<i>- Why he speaks like this?</i>
<i>- Because he's your father.</i>

340
00:38:34,945 --> 00:38:36,810
<i>But my father is dead.</i>

341
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,142
<i>What?</i>

342
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:44,684
<i>Okay, how do you want me...</i>
<i>How do you want him to speak?</i>

343
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:46,586
I think of all the joys we had.

344
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,887
<i>Normal, like you.</i>

345
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:51,553
I could've saved you, but I was weak.

346
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:57,058
My grief has gone blood-red with revenge.

347
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:01,199
I'm stronger now.

348
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:09,576
I will search the four corners of this Earth,
find Governor Odious and joyously kill him!

349
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:16,014
By the Blue Bandit's honor, I swear

350
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:20,217
I will annihilate him
and everything that he loves!

351
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:31,530
I will destroy him! I will destroy him!

352
00:39:31,602 --> 00:39:34,867
Destroy him! I will destroy him!

353
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:42,510
And every Spanish thing.

354
00:39:43,814 --> 00:39:45,873
<i>I thought he was Spanish.</i>

355
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:47,943
<i>No.</i>

356
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:51,352
<i>He was French.</i>

357
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:53,447
Are you with me, bandits?

358
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,909
Darwin! Which way to Governor Odious?

359
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:25,486
I tell him not to put the map with the bugs.

360
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:28,052
Are we lost?

361
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:29,217
Sorry, <i>Capitaine.</i>

362
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:32,392
Hey! No!

363
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:38,960
Hey! You can't eat it, it's poisonous!

364
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,310
What's he saying?

365
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:53,749
He says we should follow him
to greener pastures!

366
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:57,584
- What?
- He say it's greener down there.

367
00:40:58,189 --> 00:41:00,714
Green? Down where?

368
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:01,883
I don't know.

369
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:04,120
To greener pastures!

370
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:05,685
Slow down!

371
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:10,957
The birds in his belly
crave greener pastures!

372
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:15,099
Hey! It is greener down there.

373
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:17,834
Greener pastures.

374
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:21,343
Slow down!

375
00:41:31,455 --> 00:41:35,755
Please don't run!
The poison works faster if you run!

376
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:43,764
Slow down.

377
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:55,471
It's poisonous.

378
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:05,149
What?

379
00:43:00,778 --> 00:43:02,507
He's giving us directions.

380
00:43:33,644 --> 00:43:34,668
Go!

381
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:29,992
Slaves!

382
00:44:42,613 --> 00:44:44,376
Odious's flag.

383
00:44:50,554 --> 00:44:52,545
We must free the slaves.

384
00:45:07,504 --> 00:45:10,371
Tell me, Alexandria, do you read English?

385
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:15,603
You always stop at the same part
when it's very beautiful

386
00:45:16,513 --> 00:45:18,208
and interesting.

387
00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:21,445
I just wanted to know
if you can read English.

388
00:45:21,518 --> 00:45:22,849
Can you?

389
00:45:23,921 --> 00:45:26,481
- Can you read English?
- Yeah.

390
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:29,185
- What's this?
- Paper.

391
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:32,057
No. What's this? This.

392
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:36,532
M-o-r-p-h...

393
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:39,666
Three.

394
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:41,568
- What's that?
- Three.

395
00:45:41,638 --> 00:45:43,003
That's good.

396
00:45:46,043 --> 00:45:50,002
I'm having a hard time sleeping
and I can't remember that story.

397
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:55,318
I need some pills.

398
00:45:55,385 --> 00:45:59,481
I need pills in a bottle
that has this written on them.

399
00:45:59,556 --> 00:46:02,719
M-o-r-p-h-i-n-three?

400
00:46:02,793 --> 00:46:05,728
Yes. And it's in the main block.

401
00:46:08,966 --> 00:46:11,298
In that room in the main block.

402
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:16,762
You understand?

403
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:20,401
- Ask the head nurse.
- I'm asking you as a friend.

404
00:46:20,477 --> 00:46:23,935
- But it's stealing.
- No, it's not. Not if you need it.

405
00:46:26,016 --> 00:46:29,315
It's no different
than stealing bread from a church.

406
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:34,189
- I'll ask them for you.
- No.

407
00:46:35,893 --> 00:46:37,827
It's a bandit secret.

408
00:46:39,496 --> 00:46:42,863
I need the pills
to finish the story. Understand?

409
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:46,125
- I can't get it...
- I'll do it.

410
00:46:47,371 --> 00:46:48,565
Thanks.

411
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:02,181
You look beautiful.

412
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:07,290
Why do you put red on your cheeks?

413
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:13,554
Because it makes you look pretty

414
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:20,435
and healthy, too.

415
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:26,306
- Remember, back before lunch.
- I know!

416
00:47:26,376 --> 00:47:29,072
Alexandria, no licking the ice today?

417
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:31,706
No. Thank you! Bye!

418
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,422
One bite maybe. But a pit of snakes?

419
00:48:30,474 --> 00:48:37,141
M-o-r-p-h-i-n-three. M-o-r-p-h-i-n...

420
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:44,113
M-o-r-p-h-i-n...

421
00:49:13,483 --> 00:49:18,887
Maybe you got...
I know it's important that you listen to me.

422
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:20,947
You've gotta think of your other children.

423
00:49:21,725 --> 00:49:23,818
I'm so sorry.

424
00:49:23,894 --> 00:49:27,660
You have to warn your other children
about the sounds of rattlesnakes.

425
00:49:27,731 --> 00:49:32,566
This isn't a good time.
There are snake pits all over this area.

426
00:49:39,276 --> 00:49:42,905
Wake up! Wake up!
You better get up or they'll chop you.

427
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:47,280
You get up! You better get up
and show these people you are sleeping.

428
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:50,787
These men will chop you if you don't get up.
Get up!

429
00:49:50,854 --> 00:49:53,322
Get up. This isn't funny.

430
00:49:54,424 --> 00:49:56,756
Please, let's leave this place.

431
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:11,840
Come on. Come on!

432
00:50:18,749 --> 00:50:21,115
I do that all the time.

433
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:26,121
All you have to do is change your clothes
and hide the wet ones until they're dry.

434
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:32,817
You know what I do
when something frightens me?

435
00:50:32,896 --> 00:50:34,761
I say the magic words.

436
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,266
Googly, googly, googly, begone.

437
00:50:45,075 --> 00:50:47,669
Let's practice together.

438
00:50:47,744 --> 00:50:49,371
The magic words.

439
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:53,273
Googly, googly, googly. Go away.

440
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:03,818
- Did you get what I sent you for?
- Yes.

441
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,594
- This it is.
- Yeah?

442
00:51:09,666 --> 00:51:11,566
There's only three in here.

443
00:51:11,635 --> 00:51:14,729
- You asked me for three.
- No, I asked you for a full bottle.

444
00:51:14,805 --> 00:51:18,172
- But, you wrote...
- Was this bottle full of pills?

445
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:21,778
- Were there more pills in here?
- Yeah.

446
00:51:21,845 --> 00:51:23,107
What did you do with them?

447
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:25,808
I throw them in toilet.

448
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:30,511
But I throw them away because you wrote

449
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:35,388
m-o-r-p-h-i-n-three.

450
00:51:38,695 --> 00:51:40,856
Will they help you sleep?

451
00:51:44,668 --> 00:51:46,135
A nap perhaps.

452
00:51:53,043 --> 00:51:54,169
<i>We must free the slaves.</i>

453
00:51:54,244 --> 00:51:56,235
Did they free the slaves?

454
00:53:14,291 --> 00:53:15,918
Come out, Odious.

455
00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:41,077
Just like a butterfly.

456
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:49,821
<i>Why the mask again?</i>

457
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:52,726
<i>He doesn't want to scare her.</i>

458
00:53:52,796 --> 00:53:57,790
<i>She doesn't know anything about him,</i>
<i>but he knew everything about her.</i>

459
00:54:00,003 --> 00:54:03,097
<i>The color of her eyes.</i>

460
00:54:04,674 --> 00:54:05,663
<i>Brown.</i>

461
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:09,136
<i>Her favorite food.</i>

462
00:54:09,212 --> 00:54:10,509
<i>Orange?</i>

463
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,673
<i>Her favorite book.</i>

464
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:13,909
<i>Bible.</i>

465
00:54:15,018 --> 00:54:18,078
Boys, she's mine.

466
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:24,253
<i>- What about the bomb?</i>
<i>- What?</i>

467
00:54:24,327 --> 00:54:25,589
<i>The bomb.</i>

468
00:54:34,504 --> 00:54:39,498
<i>The bandits kidnapped the princess,</i>
<i>leaving behind her little nephew.</i>

469
00:54:46,483 --> 00:54:48,974
<i>They rode down</i>
<i>from the high mountain deserts</i>

470
00:54:49,052 --> 00:54:50,815
<i>to a place he loved.</i>

471
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:57,351
<i>He had played as a child with his twin.</i>

472
00:54:59,529 --> 00:55:02,123
<i>A palace in the middle of a lake.</i>

473
00:55:43,306 --> 00:55:46,036
What's the matter with that poor fellow?

474
00:55:48,278 --> 00:55:50,576
Ever since the Indian's misfortune

475
00:55:50,647 --> 00:55:53,707
he took a vow
to never look at another squaw.

476
00:55:53,783 --> 00:55:57,776
But a man cannot show what's in his heart
when he hides his face.

477
00:56:00,223 --> 00:56:02,691
Who, may I ask, are you?

478
00:56:02,759 --> 00:56:05,819
To most I am known as the Masked Bandit.

479
00:56:05,895 --> 00:56:08,090
The Scourge of the Southeast?

480
00:56:10,934 --> 00:56:12,458
That's the one.

481
00:56:17,907 --> 00:56:20,501
But that's only when I wear the mask.

482
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:29,852
Who are you?

483
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:36,358
Nurse Evelyn.

484
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:44,299
Once I was Lady Evelyn Everest Everhardt,
and now I am simply called...

485
00:56:44,801 --> 00:56:47,292
- Sister Evelyn.
- She is not a sister.

486
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:50,464
Bless you. No. What? Yes, she is.

487
00:56:51,474 --> 00:56:54,307
She doesn't have brothers and sisters.

488
00:56:55,311 --> 00:56:58,337
No, she's a nun, like these nuns out here.

489
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:05,419
And she turned from the Masked Bandit,
and she said...

490
00:57:05,488 --> 00:57:08,514
- May I be frank with you?
- Of course.

491
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:12,327
Although I've dedicated my life
to God and goodness

492
00:57:12,395 --> 00:57:16,798
I secretly love throwing oranges
at our priest.

493
00:57:16,866 --> 00:57:19,357
Take two turns to the left
and go to the bathroom.

494
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:20,835
No, you read my note.

495
00:57:20,904 --> 00:57:23,270
What are you talking about?
Go to the bathroom.

496
00:57:23,339 --> 00:57:25,136
No.

497
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:27,574
How do you know
about the priest and the orange?

498
00:57:27,644 --> 00:57:30,112
Everybody knows
you like throwing oranges at the priest.

499
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:34,344
Even the priest knows, but I didn't
find that out from your gibberish message.

500
00:57:34,417 --> 00:57:36,180
It's not gibberish.

501
00:58:03,746 --> 00:58:07,147
She wants to ask you
how much days I have to stay here.

502
00:58:07,217 --> 00:58:10,050
Well, I want you to stay here
until you get better.

503
00:58:12,555 --> 00:58:15,888
Her cast will come off in a few days

504
00:58:15,959 --> 00:58:20,123
but I'd like her to stay here
until she's completely recovered.

505
00:58:29,272 --> 00:58:32,002
She wants to say
that we are spend here too much times

506
00:58:32,075 --> 00:58:33,906
and we have to leave the city.

507
00:58:33,977 --> 00:58:38,209
No, well, you just tell her
that you shouldn't be working in the groves.

508
00:58:38,281 --> 00:58:40,010
That at your age it's dangerous

509
00:58:40,083 --> 00:58:43,052
and you'll spend
the rest of your days picking fruit.

510
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:45,747
And then she'll fall. She surely will fall.

511
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:13,546
Thank you.

512
00:59:14,984 --> 00:59:17,714
- What did she say?
- She says okay.

513
00:59:19,122 --> 00:59:20,555
- Really?
- Really.

514
00:59:20,623 --> 00:59:22,648
Alexandria, she asked me something,
didn't she?

515
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:24,625
No, that how we speak.
