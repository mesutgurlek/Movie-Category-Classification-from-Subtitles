1
00:00:56,883 --> 00:00:58,539
Raphael, stop running, you are gonna fall !

2
00:00:58,749 --> 00:01:00,515
The car is far , we will be in trouble

3
00:01:05,153 --> 00:01:05,701
It's pretty, isn't it?

4
00:01:06,504 --> 00:01:06,972
I don't know...

5
00:01:07,462 --> 00:01:08,549
All of this seems complicated ....

6
00:01:08,821 --> 00:01:10,222
No...; You'll see , it will change our life

7
00:01:11,035 --> 00:01:11,845
Right...

8

9
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,927
Because we are not happy here ?

10
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:10,494
yes, we are !

11
00:03:10,871 --> 00:03:12,491
At least , here we have the sea

12
00:03:12,963 --> 00:03:13,385
Also... Ho!

13
00:03:14,883 --> 00:03:16,342

Ah , Jean ! It's funny that you are calling, because we are talking about Cassi !

18
00:03:24,641 --> 00:03:25,172
And we....

19
00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:26,929
<i>I have a bad news about your transfer....</i>

20
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,460
I call you later...

21
00:03:29,611 --> 00:03:30,302
What's going on?

22
00:03:31,536 --> 00:03:32,442
You don't need to quit your job

23
00:03:32,676 --> 00:03:33,493
What?

24
00:03:34,164 --> 00:03:35,083
i did'nt obtain my transfer...

25
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:37,605
Damn it...

26
00:03:38,053 --> 00:03:39,894
You don't have to be upset ...

27
00:03:39,894 --> 00:03:41,004
I am not upset !

28
00:03:41,004 --> 00:03:42,177
Am i upset right now?

29
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:43,317
No no....

30
00:03:43,317 --> 00:03:45,717
So, don't tell me that I am upset , damn !

31
00:03:49,525 --> 00:03:50,129
Are you okay?

32
00:03:52,715 --> 00:03:54,797
I understand,  Yes , what you can do ...

33
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,294
<i>I call you later...</i>

34
00:03:56,294 --> 00:03:57,324
Thanks a lot Jean !

35
00:03:59,638 --> 00:04:00,707
Why do you thanks him?

36
00:04:01,284 --> 00:04:02,692
its was useless that he pulls trings for you !

37
00:04:03,362 --> 00:04:04,278
It's not his fault...

38
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:05,838
it's a handicap person who got the job !

39
00:04:05,838 --> 00:04:07,286
A handicap person is priority

40
00:04:07,918 --> 00:04:10,375
We have to be a handicap person in order to live in the south of France?

41
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,605
of course not...

42
00:04:12,576 --> 00:04:14,059
i was glad to move...

43
00:04:14,466 --> 00:04:15,776
But before, you didn't want to !

44
00:04:15,776 --> 00:04:17,826
i didn't want to because i know that we will move

45
00:04:18,059 --> 00:04:20,342
Now that we don't move anymore , we miss something important !

46
00:04:21,155 --> 00:04:22,013
if you want, this summer ...

47
00:04:22,013 --> 00:04:22,718
No !

48
00:04:22,718 --> 00:04:23,441
I don't care about the holydays

49
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,152
You told me that we will live on the seaside

50
00:04:25,152 --> 00:04:27,367
You have worked so hard for this transfer that we did'nt see each other

51
00:04:27,988 --> 00:04:30,319
i want to live there all year long ! You hear Philip Abrahams?

52
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:31,318

53
00:04:31,925 --> 00:04:32,925
Are you upset right now?

54
00:04:32,925 --> 00:04:33,944
Yes I am , so what?

55
00:04:33,944 --> 00:04:35,148
Don't be upset, it's useless

56
00:04:36,971 --> 00:04:39,035
Why do you always do everything to annoy me?

57
00:04:57,202 --> 00:04:58,281
Hello - Hello

58

Speak less loud , i risk a lot !

66
00:05:19,046 --> 00:05:20,054

00:05:20,054 --> 00:05:21,006
i didn't get the job

68

116
00:08:13,551 --> 00:08:13,894

I'm Philip Abrahams , you wanted to see me

119
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:17,566
Mister Lebuick

120
00:08:18,085 --> 00:08:21,244
i wanted to clarify few details about your transfer

121
00:08:21,244 --> 00:08:21,702
Of course

122
00:08:28,437 --> 00:08:28,906
little brats !

123
00:08:29,653 --> 00:08:31,201
The kids of the neighbourhood who bursted my wheel...

124
00:08:31,473 --> 00:08:32,642
They should  work at school !

125
00:08:32,982 --> 00:08:33,939
I'd be happy not to see them

126
00:08:34,423 --> 00:08:34,921
You want me to help you?

127
00:08:34,921 --> 00:08:36,201
No! I have to do it alone

128
00:08:36,538 --> 00:08:39,802
Sit down , please, it's already done for me

129
00:08:43,127 --> 00:08:44,003
How may i help you?

130
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:47,800
How long have you been handicaped , mister abrahams?

131
00:08:49,158 --> 00:08:51,188
It's rather hard for me to tell you

132
00:08:52,335 --> 00:08:53,174
I was a little kid

133
00:08:53,815 --> 00:08:54,532
Fuzzy...

134
00:08:55,797 --> 00:08:57,785
Thinking about this horrible traumatism

135
00:09:01,876 --> 00:09:04,021
Sorry, muscular spasm..

136
00:09:08,418 --> 00:09:10,882
It's ok , cool...

137
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:18,833
Mister Abrahams, two transfers has been asked by yourself, one very recently

138
00:09:19,481 --> 00:09:22,867
For the job at Sanarri , being fit...

139
00:09:23,294 --> 00:09:26,180
And this one for Cassi, six months ago

140
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,489
Are you these two same persons, mister abrahams?

141
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:32,954
I....

142
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:36,417
I've done these two requests..

143
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:37,335
I did !

144
00:09:39,051 --> 00:09:40,123
The first one...

145
00:09:40,605 --> 00:09:42,336
being valid...

146
00:09:42,621 --> 00:09:46,697
Because i want my file being conseidered as a fit person

147
00:09:46,697 --> 00:09:47,041
As everybody

148
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:49,991
It's important for us... Handicaped persons !

149
00:09:51,349 --> 00:09:54,230
To see in fit persons's sight , as you mister lebuick

150
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,070
Pity...

151
00:09:56,992 --> 00:09:58,493
As you want mister abrahamas

152
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:01,888
If there is a problem for my file...

153
00:10:01,888 --> 00:10:04,166
No no, not at all

154
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:07,113
It's just a necesarry check

155
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,898
You know, sometimes I have fake files

156
00:10:10,898 --> 00:10:12,442
To get good job

157
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:14,118
In the south of France....

158
00:10:14,118 --> 00:10:15,833
Oh no !

159
00:10:16,043 --> 00:10:18,242
What a shame !

160
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:19,695
Oh  right ,mister abrahams

161
00:10:21,424 --> 00:10:23,676
You will enjoy Sanarri sur mer

162
00:10:23,676 --> 00:10:26,520
Well... I won't disturbe you anymore

163
00:10:26,948 --> 00:10:28,223
You don't disturb me

164
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,597
Bye Mister Lebuick...

165
00:10:31,566 --> 00:10:32,348
What a shame !

166
00:10:37,284 --> 00:10:37,813
Insane !

167
00:10:38,955 --> 00:10:39,925
You are totally insane !

168
00:10:42,162 --> 00:10:42,876
You are my friend , Jean

169
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,020
You will fix that, right?

170
00:10:45,338 --> 00:10:46,224
I won't fix anything !

171
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,114
I don't want us to be friends ! Especially here

172
00:10:50,303 --> 00:10:52,973
I'm not a friend of a mad man who fakes and pretend that he is a handicp person

173
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,190
I did that for Julie

174
00:10:55,413 --> 00:10:56,424
I should'nt have done that

175
00:10:56,424 --> 00:10:57,972
I swear, I regret

176
00:11:00,064 --> 00:11:00,612
Well..

177
00:11:02,381 --> 00:11:03,584
I have a bad and a good news

179
00:11:06,191 --> 00:11:06,878
Worse...

180
00:11:07,242 --> 00:11:07,879
Fired??

181
00:11:08,628 --> 00:11:09,314
Even Worse

182
00:11:09,547 --> 00:11:10,553
Worse than fired , what is it?

183
00:11:10,973 --> 00:11:11,958

184
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:12,612

Lyon?

186
00:11:14,127 --> 00:11:16,714

Not Paris! Don't tell me , they send me in Paris?

188
00:11:19,267 --> 00:11:20,035

191
00:11:23,609 --> 00:11:25,847

00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:31,524
To Lille, the city !

196
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:32,001
The city of Lille?

197
00:11:32,221 --> 00:11:32,696
It's horrible

I can't.... I don't have warm clothes...

201
00:11:38,918 --> 00:11:40,418
I even don't know where to live

202
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,932
Look ! you have an administrativ accomodation for the director

203
00:11:44,724 --> 00:11:46,198
Damn, where am i going?

204
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:47,681
To Bergues....

205
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,102
Bourges?

206
00:11:49,478 --> 00:11:50,322
Bergues....

207
00:11:51,101 --> 00:11:52,104
I don"t want this transfer

208
00:11:52,431 --> 00:11:53,728
You can't , you have no choice

209
00:11:55,097 --> 00:11:56,788
Hum... What is the good news?

210
00:11:58,056 --> 00:11:58,601
This one ..

211
00:11:58,906 --> 00:12:00,842
So what's the bad one?

212
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:02,509
You will stay for Two years there

213
00:12:04,153 --> 00:12:05,507
Two years?

214
00:12:06,493 --> 00:12:07,193
At least..

215
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:09,362
Two years in the Nord pas de calais... No! no !

216
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:12,160
You have no choice , you have to accept to work in the north or to quit your job !

217
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:13,833
How will i tell that to Julie?

218
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,124
i haven't told her for Sanarris...

219
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,256
You can leave when the corridor is clear

220
00:12:25,806 --> 00:12:28,550
Now ! Come on , go go

221
00:12:34,202 --> 00:12:34,982
Good evening, honey

222
00:12:34,982 --> 00:12:35,480
Hi...

223
00:12:39,202 --> 00:12:41,828
Hey, i'm looking at Sanarris sur mer, and there are such wonderfuls flats !

224
00:12:42,516 --> 00:12:43,548
We should be hurry in order to visit

225
00:12:43,548 --> 00:12:44,636
Don't worry , we don't go anymore

226
00:12:44,855 --> 00:12:45,294
What?

227
00:12:45,294 --> 00:12:46,294
a controrder..

228
00:12:46,564 --> 00:12:48,106
Don't tell me that a handicaped person had a job?

229
00:12:48,106 --> 00:12:49,689
Kinda, yes...

230
00:12:50,232 --> 00:12:51,041
It can't be true..

231
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,922
Wait ! We propose me something more interesting !

232
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,010
Oh, I was frighten...

233
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:56,826
Where?

234
00:12:57,075 --> 00:12:57,637
Where?

235
00:12:58,136 --> 00:12:59,279
To Bergues !

236
00:12:59,544 --> 00:12:59,918
What?

237
00:12:59,918 --> 00:13:01,859
Bergues, the beautiful city of bergues !

238
00:13:02,234 --> 00:13:02,840
Bergues?

239
00:13:03,263 --> 00:13:05,107
Bergues , in the nord pas de calais !

240
00:13:05,403 --> 00:13:06,260
It's wonderful, isn't it?

241
00:13:07,137 --> 00:13:08,044
Philip, what have you done?

242
00:13:08,296 --> 00:13:09,325
me? nothing

243
00:13:09,701 --> 00:13:10,449
i'm not stupid...

244
00:13:10,967 --> 00:13:12,544
The ones who works well stay in the south of France

245
00:13:12,764 --> 00:13:14,499
In the North, means that you did something serious

246
00:13:15,204 --> 00:13:15,902
Not at all...

247
00:13:16,108 --> 00:13:18,762
The direction proposes me to spend two years in the north

248
00:13:18,982 --> 00:13:19,482
I get points !

249
00:13:20,105 --> 00:13:21,452
I'm the first to get any jobs !

250
00:13:21,452 --> 00:13:22,591
Especially in the south of France!

251
00:13:22,591 --> 00:13:27,637
Because, if i spend two years in the Nord pas de calais, Im considered as a handicaped person !

252
00:13:27,637 --> 00:13:28,885
i don't want to !

253
00:13:28,885 --> 00:13:29,811
i won't freeze to death

254
00:13:29,811 --> 00:13:31,511
Who will freeze to death?

255
00:13:31,814 --> 00:13:33,576
Julie, we won't live outside there !

256
00:13:33,795 --> 00:13:35,621
Dad, i don't want to loose my toes !

257
00:13:35,621 --> 00:13:36,981
Why would you loose you toes?

258
00:13:36,981 --> 00:13:38,421
i don't want to live in the North Pole...

259
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:40,919
We are not going in the North Pole , but in the North of france !

260
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,231
Philip , tell me the truth..

261
00:13:42,231 --> 00:13:43,201
What did you do?

262
00:13:43,201 --> 00:13:45,969
I have such a great promotion, i don't understand your reaction !

263
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:47,807
Well, i call Jean

264
00:13:51,728 --> 00:13:54,241
In order to have the job in Sannari, i pretend to be a handicaped person..

265
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:56,129
pretend to be a handicaped person..

266
00:13:56,523 --> 00:13:57,400
i'm sorry

267
00:13:57,649 --> 00:13:58,849
You will go alone in the North Pole !

268
00:14:17,826 --> 00:14:18,286
hello..

269
00:14:28,857 --> 00:14:35,503
(strong north french accent )

270
00:14:36,286 --> 00:14:36,953
What is it?

271
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:38,981
Who is it?

272
00:14:39,341 --> 00:14:41,764
You know who I am? I am philip, your nephew's husband

273
00:14:42,544 --> 00:14:46,218
Oh yes.. She told me that you will annoy me !

274
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,141
What do you want?

275
00:14:51,825 --> 00:14:53,826
i have to leave in the Nord pas de calais....

276
00:14:54,575 --> 00:14:55,295
A transfer !

277
00:14:56,019 --> 00:14:58,551
Julie told me that you knew a little the coutnry around Lille

278
00:14:59,226 --> 00:15:00,642
yes, in 1934,

279
00:15:01,502 --> 00:15:03,799
My mother has slept with a " ch'timi "

280
00:15:04,331 --> 00:15:05,015
What a re you sayin'?

281
00:15:05,915 --> 00:15:10,707
In 1934, my mother has slept with a "ch'timi "

282
00:15:11,016 --> 00:15:11,971
A " ch'ti me "?

283
00:15:12,223 --> 00:15:19,171
Not a " ch'ti me " a "ch'ti mi " , everybody is called like that in the north, children, wowen, men..

284
00:15:20,877 --> 00:15:21,610
Des " ch'ti mis " ?

285
00:15:22,426 --> 00:15:24,258
Even the animals are " ch'ti mis"...

286
00:15:25,014 --> 00:15:27,611
cats too... cats....

287
00:15:27,923 --> 00:15:30,673
Cows... Chickens.........

288
00:15:30,673 --> 00:15:32,600
Veals...; all " ch'ti mis "

289
00:15:33,672 --> 00:15:34,640
The language too is "ch'ti mi "

290
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,175
"o" instead of "a"

291
00:15:37,388 --> 00:15:38,695
"che" instead of "que"

292
00:15:38,695 --> 00:15:41,913
et "ce" instead of "ce"

293
00:15:41,913 --> 00:15:43,299
It's diferent..

294
00:15:44,642 --> 00:15:51,515
And when you thin you have understood , you think that a word is in reality an other one...

295
00:15:53,517 --> 00:15:56,498
How is the life there?

296
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:57,829
Quiet no?

297
00:15:57,829 --> 00:15:58,751
No...

298
00:15:58,751 --> 00:16:00,788
tough , tough.....

299
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:03,795
There is only the ones who work in the coalmine who live well

300
00:16:04,733 --> 00:16:06,374
The others are just...

301
00:16:06,852 --> 00:16:08,080
Depressed...

302
00:16:09,017 --> 00:16:11,281
And they die very young, very very young there

303
00:16:11,891 --> 00:16:14,549
Fortunately , my mother moved in the south of France

304
00:16:14,957 --> 00:16:15,797
i was ten

305
00:16:16,064 --> 00:16:18,577
I could not bear the cool

306
00:16:19,193 --> 00:16:20,234
Is it very cold?

307
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:24,923
In summer , it's ok, it's 0° or 1 °

308
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:28,081
But in winter, it's going down , down....

309
00:16:28,426 --> 00:16:31,362
-10° , -20° , -30°

310
00:16:32,234 --> 00:16:34,655
And also -40°

311
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:36,639
-40°?

312
00:16:37,234 --> 00:16:39,194
IT'S THE NORTH !

313
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,887
You asked me kid, right? IT'S THE NORTH !

314
00:16:45,675 --> 00:16:46,507
Did i answer?

315
00:16:47,392 --> 00:16:48,941
Get out !

316
00:17:20,102 --> 00:17:21,078
You see ! Freezing fog ...

317
00:17:21,456 --> 00:17:22,389
What is a freezing fog?

318
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:23,457
It's horrible

319
00:17:24,867 --> 00:17:28,318
No , you see? 6° in the morning and 11° the afternon, that's not so bad..

320
00:17:28,596 --> 00:17:29,849
You think that these are the real temparatures?

321
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:32,265
Of course ! No?

322
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,881
Open your eyes, Philip

323
00:17:34,202 --> 00:17:36,825
In the North, they fake the temperatures

324
00:17:37,472 --> 00:17:38,817
Otherwise, nobody will come

325
00:17:38,817 --> 00:17:39,601
You think?

326
00:17:41,638 --> 00:17:42,973
Freezing fog....

327
00:17:47,981 --> 00:17:48,783
It does not exist..

328
00:17:49,198 --> 00:17:51,623
<i>Itinerary calculated..</i>

329
00:17:51,623 --> 00:17:52,943
It exists !

330
00:17:52,943 --> 00:17:54,743
<i>Please follow..</i>

331
00:17:54,743 --> 00:17:55,593
Shut up , bitch !

332
00:18:06,504 --> 00:18:08,693
Sorry not to come with you but I can't...

333
00:18:09,147 --> 00:18:10,722
You are better here with the sun, with the kid

334
00:18:12,661 --> 00:18:13,814

Where are the furnitures?

425
00:23:58,926 --> 00:24:02,966
In this scene, the "ch'ti " says " dog" instead of "his" in French, impossilbe to translate in english !

426
00:24:03,373 --> 00:24:04,361

The last director took them with him

428
00:24:07,996 --> 00:24:08,780
Why did he leave with the furnitures?

429
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,023
Because it belongs to the "dogs"

430
00:24:12,123 --> 00:24:12,839
What "dogs?

431
00:24:13,086 --> 00:24:13,588
The furnitures !

432
00:24:13,857 --> 00:24:14,884
I don't understand !

433
00:24:15,432 --> 00:24:16,495
The furnitures belongs to the "dogs "

434
00:24:16,728 --> 00:24:18,641
the furnitures belong to the "dogs", what does the dogs do with the furnitures?

435
00:24:19,088 --> 00:24:20,516
Why did he give furnitures to the dogs?

436
00:24:20,516 --> 00:24:23,551
No ! Not the dogs , animal, but his "dogs" !

437
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,589
Why are you saying that he gave them?

438
00:24:25,805 --> 00:24:26,621
I've never said that !

439
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,496
You said " dogs " !

440
00:24:29,011 --> 00:24:31,275
You sais , his furnitures belong to the "dogs"..

00:24:36,123 --> 00:24:37,273

500
00:27:54,154 --> 00:27:55,778
Ah... We are still in the Nord pas de calais?

501
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:58,290
Yea ! it's a house, not a barge !

502
00:27:58,993 --> 00:28:00,336
Well, One tea please

503
00:28:01,258 --> 00:28:02,836
There is no tea, only coffee

504
00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:03,711
What else?

505
00:28:04,024 --> 00:28:05,084
Nothing... Only coffee

506
00:28:05,084 --> 00:28:06,104
Well, coffee...

507
00:28:11,512 --> 00:28:15,168
( strong north french accent )

508
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,372
Why is he sleeping in the guest bedroom?

509
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:21,094
This bedroom...You don't need to borrow a bedroom !

510
00:28:25,232 --> 00:28:26,315
Are you sure we don"t have tea?

511
00:28:26,797 --> 00:28:27,734
I hate tea !

512
00:28:28,014 --> 00:28:29,238
You hear what I'm saying?

513
00:28:30,701 --> 00:28:33,716
mommy... I didn't want him to sleep in the living room....

514
00:28:34,324 --> 00:28:35,748
It's my new boss ....

515
00:28:36,078 --> 00:28:37,236
That's not the point !

516
00:28:41,201 --> 00:28:42,427
Hello madam !

517
00:28:42,824 --> 00:28:43,343
Hello...

518
00:28:43,903 --> 00:28:44,512
Sit down

519
00:28:48,762 --> 00:28:50,590
Did you move something in the guestroom?

520
00:28:53,169 --> 00:28:54,450
No madam, I didn't !

521
00:28:54,653 --> 00:28:55,928
Have you made the med?

522
00:28:56,389 --> 00:28:57,481
Not yet...

523
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:58,779
Stop mom...

524
00:28:58,779 --> 00:28:59,622
She is kidding !

525
00:28:59,889 --> 00:29:01,015
I'm not kidding at all...

526
00:29:01,528 --> 00:29:04,139
He is the boss right, but he has to do the corves !

527
00:29:04,763 --> 00:29:05,637
Right boy?

528
00:29:05,637 --> 00:29:06,262
Yes madam...

529
00:29:09,298 --> 00:29:10,887
Is that caramel?

530
00:29:11,355 --> 00:29:14,093
No it is some chicory, we always put chicory in the coffee ...

531
00:29:14,298 --> 00:29:14,887
Some what?

532
00:29:15,098 --> 00:29:16,138
Chicory !

533
00:29:16,997 --> 00:29:19,051
Taste it !

534
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:24,653
Is it bad, right?

535
00:29:24,653 --> 00:29:26,014
No it's not !

536
00:29:37,608 --> 00:29:39,262
What have you put on your toast?

537
00:29:39,577 --> 00:29:40,326
That?

538
00:29:41,035 --> 00:29:42,481
It is "maroille" (very strong cheese ! )

539
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:43,702
" maroill " ? What is it?

540
00:29:44,028 --> 00:29:45,637
It's a cheese which smells a bit strong..

541
00:29:46,504 --> 00:29:47,653
Like an old cheese...

542
00:29:48,346 --> 00:29:49,282
You want to taste?

543
00:29:49,653 --> 00:29:50,826
no !

544
00:29:50,826 --> 00:29:51,763
you are wrong !

545
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,137
It's less strong by tasting that smelling...

546
00:29:59,826 --> 00:30:00,763
It's good , right?

547
00:30:01,121 --> 00:30:03,090
Oh ! It is also strong inside !

548
00:30:03,312 --> 00:30:04,965
That's why we dip it in the coffee !

549
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,090
That is sweeten....

550
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:07,823
come on, dip !

551
00:30:08,126 --> 00:30:09,170
No , I won't !

552
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:10,074
Come on !

553
00:30:16,504 --> 00:30:17,224
good !

554
00:30:22,723 --> 00:30:23,226
Young man !

555
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:26,270
It is a cake with brown sugar...

556
00:30:26,566 --> 00:30:28,130
You have not eaten....

557
00:30:35,427 --> 00:30:36,240
Thank you...

558
00:30:36,849 --> 00:30:38,069
Well, and not before time either !

559
00:30:38,575 --> 00:30:40,264
my " ch'ti"....

560
00:30:41,661 --> 00:30:42,629
Don't come back too late

561
00:30:42,629 --> 00:30:43,272
i won't !

562
00:30:43,958 --> 00:30:44,519
Bye !

563
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:45,551
Promise?

564
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:46,490
Yes !

565
00:30:47,957 --> 00:30:48,711
Very Special mom !

566
00:30:49,037 --> 00:30:50,604
Not for me ! I've always known her this way !

567
00:30:51,198 --> 00:30:52,386
Is that some "maroille" in the brown sugar cake?

568
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:54,987
No because you have still the smell of the cheese in your nose !

569
00:30:55,227 --> 00:30:56,551
o... Everything stinks !

570
00:30:56,551 --> 00:30:58,736
Breathe with the mouth , it will ventilate...

571
00:31:00,772 --> 00:31:01,396
That the " maroille "...

572
00:31:08,459 --> 00:31:09,872
Weird... it's not that cold !

573
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,040
For April, it's pretty hot...

574
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,306
Yes , right...

575
00:31:13,772 --> 00:31:15,118
It's because of  the global warning !

576
00:31:15,812 --> 00:31:17,162
It was colder before , was not it?

577
00:31:17,929 --> 00:31:21,476
Yes , at this time years ago, we were  skating on ice, building a snowman..

578
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:22,570
Sure...

579
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:26,865
The part of the cool that i regret most, is that I was delivering the mail with a sleigh !

580
00:31:27,682 --> 00:31:29,247
With a sleigh, are you kidding me?

581
00:31:29,247 --> 00:31:30,197
A little bit , sir...

582
00:31:30,197 --> 00:31:31,053
It's not funny !

583
00:31:31,259 --> 00:31:32,007
not at all !

584
00:31:32,287 --> 00:31:34,351
Why have you chosen the North if you are afraid to freeze to death?

585
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:35,169

No , not the " Chouth ", the  South....

608
00:32:24,585 --> 00:32:26,500
S.O.U.T.H, the "Chouth" I don't know where it is...

609
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:33,532

00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:04,547
Yes or no??

677
00:36:06,695 --> 00:36:07,536
Don"t move !

678
00:36:10,378 --> 00:36:11,471

Fine...

683
00:36:17,955 --> 00:36:19,454
<i>I'm listening to you Mister Vasseur...</i>

684
00:36:22,932 --> 00:36:24,648
We are going to lunch, are you coming with us?

685
00:36:25,922 --> 00:36:26,557
Where are you going?

686
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:27,981
To the " French fries House"

687
00:36:28,576 --> 00:36:29,322
"French fries House"....

688
00:36:30,281 --> 00:36:31,158
What a pretty name !

689
00:36:35,058 --> 00:36:35,616

Where is your restaurant?

693
00:36:43,384 --> 00:36:43,922
What?

694
00:36:44,265 --> 00:36:44,945
What restaurant?

695
00:36:45,335 --> 00:36:46,714
Your restaurant...

696
00:36:47,571 --> 00:36:48,538
"French Fries House "

697
00:36:49,089 --> 00:36:50,448
aa.. It's not a restaurant !

698
00:36:50,448 --> 00:36:52,430
a " French Fries House " is a French Fries House !

699
00:36:52,654 --> 00:36:53,203
Right there !

700
00:37:00,055 --> 00:37:02,860
<i> Take away or here?</i>

701
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:03,901
It's a caravan...

702
00:37:04,558 --> 00:37:06,711
It used to be a caravan ! Now its a French Fries House...

703
00:37:06,711 --> 00:37:08,651
They don't sleep here anymore.. They're making french fries....

704
00:37:10,587 --> 00:37:11,447
<i> Next please !</i>

705
00:37:13,717 --> 00:37:14,413
Hi there !

706
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:15,276

00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:18,276
Yes !

710
00:37:18,523 --> 00:37:20,538
Two French Fries with one american....

711
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:21,526
Allright !

712
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,779
"Fricadelle " and one american...

713
00:37:22,779 --> 00:37:23,664

716
00:37:29,868 --> 00:37:30,514
Which condiment?

717
00:37:30,742 --> 00:37:31,678
Picadilly !

718
00:37:31,678 --> 00:37:32,897
<i>Allright, picadilly !</i>

719
00:37:32,897 --> 00:37:34,179
<i> And one Picadilly !</i>

720
00:37:35,277 --> 00:37:36,555
aaaa that's  gipsy food !

721
00:37:36,555 --> 00:37:37,389
What?

722
00:37:37,824 --> 00:37:39,985
No...no, it's our speciality !

723
00:37:46,117 --> 00:37:46,695
That's good !

724
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,178
What's in there?

725
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:51,803
" Fricadelle " We can tell you what there is inside of it !

726
00:37:52,196 --> 00:37:55,762
In the North, everybody knows what there is inside of it !

727
00:37:56,854 --> 00:37:58,117
But nobody says it !

728
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,838
It's like americans with the " coco "

729
00:38:01,616 --> 00:38:02,241
The what?

730
00:38:03,344 --> 00:38:04,319
The " coco -colo "

731
00:38:05,078 --> 00:38:06,491
aaa the coca - cola !

732
00:38:06,921 --> 00:38:08,194
It's what he has just said !

733
00:38:08,194 --> 00:38:09,366
The "coco -  colo " !

734
00:38:16,759 --> 00:38:17,888
That a nice little place !

735
00:38:18,452 --> 00:38:19,968
it's not the little place but the big one !

736
00:38:20,963 --> 00:38:22,132
This church is lovely !

737
00:38:23,303 --> 00:38:23,959
It's not a church !

738
00:38:23,959 --> 00:38:25,776
There is nothing religious with it...

739
00:38:25,992 --> 00:38:26,990
it's our belfry !

740
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:30,327
During the Middle age, it helps the army to prevent the ennemies to come in !

741
00:38:31,072 --> 00:38:32,275
Let them come !

742
00:38:34,371 --> 00:38:35,990
We see all the country here, it's beautiful !

743
00:38:36,336 --> 00:38:39,334
But you need to ask Antoine to show you, he is the bellringer !

744
00:38:39,822 --> 00:38:40,491
The what?

745
00:38:40,491 --> 00:38:41,382
The bell ringer?

746
00:38:41,382 --> 00:38:45,883
Right there, there are about 50 bells called peal of bells...

747
00:38:46,118 --> 00:38:47,757
And Antoine is the only guy who know how to play !

748
00:38:47,757 --> 00:38:49,559
In his family, everybody used to be a bell ringer !

749
00:38:49,958 --> 00:38:52,193
When he plays, it's beautiful!

750
00:38:52,702 --> 00:38:54,085
We hear him very far away...

751
00:38:54,678 --> 00:38:55,618
it's true....

752
00:38:59,429 --> 00:39:00,649
Momo, a beer please !

753
00:39:01,195 --> 00:39:02,897
Oh Antoine, we were talking about you?

754
00:39:03,805 --> 00:39:04,427
Really?

755
00:39:04,981 --> 00:39:08,271
You were not talking about your biker? the show off man?

756
00:39:08,271 --> 00:39:09,915
Why is not here, He does not like french fries the " boubours " ?!

757
00:39:09,915 --> 00:39:10,709
It's not funny, stop !

758
00:39:10,709 --> 00:39:12,990
me too I can show off with my bike !

759
00:39:14,896 --> 00:39:15,931
Come to sit Antoine !

760
00:39:19,898 --> 00:39:20,990
I know you !

761
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:21,927
It it the South guy !

762
00:39:22,803 --> 00:39:23,598
Are you okay?

763
00:39:24,661 --> 00:39:25,778
Are you allright Bailleul?

764
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:27,791
You know what he did that night?

765
00:39:27,791 --> 00:39:29,132
I invited to my house

766
00:39:29,132 --> 00:39:33,600
He saw the pictures of us on the wall and he freaked out. He closed his door

767
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,692
You were afraid that I fell in love with you?

768
00:39:38,497 --> 00:39:39,624
Don't be out of respect !

769
00:39:40,078 --> 00:39:41,793
it will be sad if I give you a warning the first day...

770
00:39:42,343 --> 00:39:44,546
Oh ! I'm frighten !

771
00:39:44,824 --> 00:39:45,590
Well....

772
00:39:45,951 --> 00:39:47,202
No, we'll pay !

773
00:39:49,202 --> 00:39:51,686
So? You didn't learn to say " thank you " in your country?

774
00:39:52,154 --> 00:39:53,142
Antoine stop !

775
00:39:53,389 --> 00:39:54,186
Enough !

776
00:39:54,638 --> 00:39:55,779
you must be ashamed....

777
00:39:55,779 --> 00:39:56,747
He has just arrived !

778
00:39:56,986 --> 00:39:59,685
Imagine that you are in the South and that we speak to you this way !

779
00:40:20,979 --> 00:40:22,464
We have been knowing for a long time with Antoine...

780
00:40:22,464 --> 00:40:23,720
He is not a bad guy, you know !

781
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:25,146
It's not a reason to insult me...

782
00:40:26,144 --> 00:40:27,547
And it is forbiddent to drink during hi work...

783
00:40:27,848 --> 00:40:29,631
Especially his mother who makes his life more difficult...

784
00:40:29,631 --> 00:40:30,604
It's not a reason !

785
00:40:32,209 --> 00:40:33,706
You won't give him his warning?

786
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:36,779
Have you forgotten something?

787
00:40:37,233 --> 00:40:37,791
How are you , Sir?

788
00:40:37,791 --> 00:40:38,709
What do you wanr bailleul?

789
00:40:38,709 --> 00:40:40,131
We agree with the colleagues...

790
00:40:40,372 --> 00:40:42,475
We have all gave you something to furnish upstairs !

791
00:40:42,775 --> 00:40:43,288
Look at that !

792
00:40:44,366 --> 00:40:46,131
A chair..;

793
00:40:48,193 --> 00:40:48,725
Look !

794
00:40:51,465 --> 00:40:52,374
The footstool !

795
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:00,337
It's better than before, right?

796
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:03,213
it's look like a flat of Lille !

797
00:41:03,447 --> 00:41:06,405
It's vey nice, it's wonderful, you didn't have to !

798
00:41:06,933 --> 00:41:08,414
I'm a bit disapointed...

799
00:41:08,718 --> 00:41:09,586
Why?

800
00:41:10,508 --> 00:41:12,146
Beyond tonight, we don't sleep together...

801
00:41:17,081 --> 00:41:18,692
How will I thank you... Except...

802
00:41:18,912 --> 00:41:20,002
for the French Fries House..

803
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:22,372
Oh ! We can eat together In Lille !

804
00:41:22,918 --> 00:41:24,627
Oh no.. my back hurts me so bad...

805
00:41:24,627 --> 00:41:27,397
It's okay, you don't eat with your back !

806
00:41:27,831 --> 00:41:29,227
You know Lille, Mister Abrahams?

807
00:41:29,755 --> 00:41:31,806
Is it a cheese which smells bad again?

808
00:41:32,027 --> 00:41:34,050
Sure, but it's a nice city too !

809
00:41:59,624 --> 00:42:00,424
What do you want to eat?

810
00:42:00,424 --> 00:42:01,071
I invite you !

811
00:42:01,642 --> 00:42:03,299
There are a lot of specialities here !

812
00:42:03,548 --> 00:42:05,390
The best one " le Chichon au gratin "

813
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:07,016
The " Chicon au gratin "?

814
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:10,000
No ! The " chichon au gratin " it's like big  endives with some béchamel sauce!

815
00:42:11,298 --> 00:42:12,735
And the " Maroille Pie"

816
00:42:13,237 --> 00:42:14,287
And the Maroille , I know what it is !

817
00:42:14,674 --> 00:42:15,725
He has to taste the "carbonate "!

818
00:42:15,725 --> 00:42:17,784
He must not leave before tasting the "carbonate "!

819
00:42:18,016 --> 00:42:18,485
The what?

820
00:42:18,485 --> 00:42:19,424
The carbonate !

821
00:42:19,424 --> 00:42:21,812
It's like a  boiled beef with vegetables

822
00:42:22,484 --> 00:42:23,859
We won't order everything...

823
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:26,111
We just have to take a little of each food ! and  we pick at one's food !

824
00:42:26,612 --> 00:42:28,358
Right?

825
00:42:28,812 --> 00:42:29,770
Yes !

826
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:34,657
It's not complicated to speak " ch'timi"...

827
00:42:34,657 --> 00:42:35,265
For example...

828
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:38,822
We don't say : " Sorry sir, I beg you pardon , i didn't understand what you have just said"

829
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:40,332
We say : " WHAT?"

830
00:42:40,332 --> 00:42:41,110
What?

831
00:42:41,735 --> 00:42:44,097
No that's not a real " what" !

832
00:42:44,097 --> 00:42:45,831
It has to get out from here !

833
00:42:45,831 --> 00:42:46,720
What?

834
00:42:48,539 --> 00:42:51,266
At the beginnig, when you start speaking " ch'ti "

835
00:42:51,266 --> 00:42:53,265
or the " picard " we are similar...

836
00:42:53,486 --> 00:42:55,687
You have to add a " what " at the end of the sentence !

837
00:42:55,687 --> 00:42:56,608
Come on try !

838
00:42:57,109 --> 00:42:58,485

839
00:42:58,485 --> 00:42:59,383
Great !

840
00:42:59,593 --> 00:43:00,720
Ok , what?

841
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,362
Here, you speak " ch'timi" !

842
00:43:02,362 --> 00:43:03,587
Damn !

843
00:43:03,587 --> 00:43:07,297
no ! We don't say " damn", we say " vindedious " !

844
00:43:07,297 --> 00:43:08,765
" vindedious ", what ?

845
00:43:08,765 --> 00:43:09,882
Good job "biloute" !

846
00:43:10,172 --> 00:43:11,547
Good job , who?

847
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:12,531
"biloute" !

848
00:43:12,983 --> 00:43:15,765
Evrybody is called like that, it's a whole nickname !

849
00:43:16,005 --> 00:43:17,423
What the meaning of " biloute " ?

850
00:43:17,655 --> 00:43:19,471
" biloute "?

851
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:20,857
It means.....

852
00:43:23,204 --> 00:43:24,096
that means nothing !

853
00:43:25,014 --> 00:43:26,515
It means , little penis....

854
00:43:27,943 --> 00:43:28,881
Little penis?

855
00:43:29,192 --> 00:43:32,268
Yes, no... It's nothing about penis...

856
00:43:32,268 --> 00:43:33,584
It's just affectionate !

857
00:43:33,955 --> 00:43:35,923
ok ok !

858
00:43:35,923 --> 00:43:38,875
Teach me insults ! it's important to learn insults when you star a new language !

859
00:43:39,232 --> 00:43:42,232
We don't say " shit " we say " dubrin " !

860
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:45,297
We don' t say " jerk", we say " boubours " !

861
00:43:45,297 --> 00:43:46,191
" boubours " !

862
00:43:46,392 --> 00:43:48,408
In the South , we say " couillostis " !

863
00:43:48,408 --> 00:43:49,342
That's pretty !

864
00:43:49,342 --> 00:43:51,272
We don't say " hell !" but " miard " !

865
00:43:51,272 --> 00:43:53,561
" dubrin " , " miard " , what? !!

866
00:43:54,483 --> 00:43:55,502
I noticed too that..

867
00:43:55,502 --> 00:43:58,755
We don't say " me " but "ti ".. No !

868
00:43:58,755 --> 00:44:02,880
No ! We don't say " me " but " mi" and not " you " but "ti" !

869
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:03,959
Right !

870
00:44:04,281 --> 00:44:08,735
It's like " che " become " ce " and " ce " become "che " !

871
00:44:08,985 --> 00:44:12,600
Like " chores " became " cores " !

872
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,734
Right !

873
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:15,723
You have to order something !

874
00:44:15,723 --> 00:44:16,797
No; no ,no...

875
00:44:16,797 --> 00:44:18,670

876
00:44:18,969 --> 00:44:20,546
Yes, that's a good idea ! " Chek le dedans "

877
00:44:21,004 --> 00:44:22,029
"check the..." what?

878
00:44:23,078 --> 00:44:24,309
" Check le dedans "...

879
00:44:24,538 --> 00:44:25,935
Which means?

880
00:44:26,732 --> 00:44:28,654
Means, " let's do it Sir, don't be afraid !

881
00:44:29,171 --> 00:44:29,686
Well...

882

1010
00:50:46,965 --> 00:50:48,077
Are they awful with you?

1011

1012
00:50:50,651 --> 00:50:51,607
First, they drink !

00:50:52,045 --> 00:50:52,575
All of them...

1014
00:50:52,902 --> 00:50:53,591
A lot...

1015
00:50:54,355 --> 00:50:55,450
It is the only thing they have...;

1016
00:50:55,717 --> 00:50:58,340
To the Post Office , it's like the Middle age, I can't understand what they say , like

1017
00:51:01,512 --> 00:51:02,994
Sure, alcoholics....

1018

They are not really alcoholic...But...

1019
00:51:06,935 --> 00:51:08,091
They drink to warm up...

1020
00:51:08,091 --> 00:51:10,119
It's is always cold right there, it amounts to the same thing...

1021
00:51:10,526 --> 00:51:11,385

For example...

1067
00:53:14,284 --> 00:53:18,692
" Hello , it's Antoine, I gave the file to the responsable of the mail room " !

1068
00:53:18,952 --> 00:53:19,671

Here...

1084
00:54:55,914 --> 00:54:57,743
Antoine has forgotten his lunch again...

1085
00:54:59,059 --> 00:55:00,947
Antoine is easily influenced....

1086
00:55:01,637 --> 00:55:03,697
You can't ask him so many things...

1087
00:55:04,907 --> 00:55:07,137
He can't go to the French Fries House everyday !

1088
00:55:08,822 --> 00:55:10,008
Can i count on you?

1089
00:55:10,718 --> 00:55:11,907

1090
00:55:12,761 --> 00:55:13,435

1091
00:55:13,855 --> 00:55:14,916
YES madam...

1092
00:55:19,479 --> 00:55:23,164
Well.....That's a bit tacky...

1093
00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:30,211
I won't tell anything... But I have some doubts...

1094
00:55:31,381 --> 00:55:32,261
Really !

1095
00:55:36,589 --> 00:55:39,843
Here madam ! I'm sorry , it took  a long time, sorry....

1096
00:55:39,843 --> 00:55:40,745
Bye !

1097
00:55:41,984 --> 00:55:43,236
Next please !

1098
00:55:43,581 --> 00:55:45,176
Hello madam, how may I help you?

1099
00:55:45,176 --> 00:55:46,983
I'd like to weigh that letter and stamped it .

1100
00:55:46,983 --> 00:55:48,071
<i> Nice stamps please</i>

1101
00:55:48,308 --> 00:55:50,027
my little kid collects them !

1102
00:55:50,402 --> 00:55:51,716
That's cute...

1103
00:55:53,524 --> 00:55:56,166
You like this one? there is a hedgehog on it !

1104
00:55:56,775 --> 00:55:58,018
Yes, perfect...

1105
00:55:58,588 --> 00:55:59,838
envelope...

1106
00:56:03,339 --> 00:56:04,916
" vindedious " , 20 pounds !

1107
00:56:05,267 --> 00:56:07,087
20 pounds, it's impossible...

1108
00:56:07,324 --> 00:56:08,508
it might be grams...

1109
00:56:08,830 --> 00:56:11,009
yes , right ! I was wondering what there was in it...

1110
00:56:17,122 --> 00:56:18,432
17  !

1111
00:56:18,432 --> 00:56:20,371
17  for 20 grams?

1112
00:56:20,617 --> 00:56:22,298
It's impossible.. how much are the stamps?

1113
00:56:24,523 --> 00:56:27,712
Is there a problem If i add stamps with  a goat?

1114
00:56:27,712 --> 00:56:29,446
Are you mad? You may be wrong !

1115
00:56:30,921 --> 00:56:33,400
What a mess........ No place for the hedgehogs...

1116
00:56:34,525 --> 00:56:36,768
I have to put the other stamps on the other side...

1117
00:56:37,264 --> 00:56:38,837
17  for 20 grams.....

1118
00:56:39,731 --> 00:56:41,887
It's impossible ! you are wrong !

1119
00:56:42,181 --> 00:56:46,841
I have swallowed some stamps, but you don't pay for them, don't worry...

1120
00:56:47,181 --> 00:56:48,273
Stop it !

1121
00:56:49,958 --> 00:56:50,986
Give me that Antoine...

1122
00:56:51,389 --> 00:56:52,398

1123
00:56:52,647 --> 00:56:56,273
I take care of it madam.. You won't pay anything !

1124
00:56:56,570 --> 00:56:57,898
Don't worry, I'm on it !

1125
00:56:58,556 --> 00:56:59,385
I'm coming !

1126
00:57:15,399 --> 00:57:16,491
That rings you a bell?

1127
00:57:16,242 --> 00:57:17,981
Leave me alone... Go home !

1128
00:57:18,233 --> 00:57:19,479
Have a nap !

1129
00:57:20,587 --> 00:57:22,980
Annabelle i don't know what i'll do without you....

1130
00:57:24,131 --> 00:57:26,037
You won't drink, trust me , it will be good for you...

1131
00:57:26,037 --> 00:57:27,054
Come on...

1132
00:57:53,649 --> 00:57:55,572
So?

1133
00:57:56,118 --> 00:57:57,087
That was awesome !

1134
00:58:03,265 --> 00:58:03,824
Great !

1135
00:58:04,265 --> 00:58:04,680
What?

1136
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:05,523
Great !

1137
00:58:10,288 --> 00:58:11,209
Oh " dubrin " !

1138
00:58:11,459 --> 00:58:12,085
Great , right?

1139
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:14,271
How are you Antoine?

1140
00:58:14,509 --> 00:58:16,866
Fine, fine , I won't " braire" ( cry)

1141
00:58:17,147 --> 00:58:17,864
" braire "?

1142
00:58:18,190 --> 00:58:19,346
It means "cry"...

1143
00:58:20,198 --> 00:58:21,116
How do you say " laugh "?

1144
00:58:21,321 --> 00:58:22,882
" laugh" we say " laugh" !

1145
00:58:23,239 --> 00:58:24,409
That's the same !

1146
00:58:24,709 --> 00:58:26,760
We must at least speak a bit french , right?

1147
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:31,867
About the work, everything ok?

1148
00:58:32,605 --> 00:58:34,209
no problem...

1149
00:58:35,910 --> 00:58:38,583
I'd like to tell you something....

1150
00:58:38,929 --> 00:58:41,084
We are all happy that you are our new director...

1151
00:58:41,583 --> 00:58:42,730
Thank you Antoine...

1152
00:58:43,543 --> 00:58:46,167
You live in a country very welcoming , really..

1153
00:58:46,542 --> 00:58:52,009
We maybe a country welcoming but if we have nobody to welcome , we thanks you...

1154
00:58:52,519 --> 00:58:53,691
You are welcome...

1155
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:58,583
There is a huge ch'timi proverb which says...

1156
00:58:58,583 --> 00:59:01,616
" When a strranger comes in the north , he " braire " twice...

1157
00:59:01,943 --> 00:59:04,208
Once he arrives, and when he leaves "....

1158
00:59:05,301 --> 00:59:07,112
That's true i felt bad when i arrived there...

1159
00:59:07,323 --> 00:59:08,957
You'll see when you will leave...

1160
00:59:09,208 --> 00:59:10,315

I have invited our friends to cheer you up !

1177
00:59:58,841 --> 00:59:59,824
Dad !

1178
00:59:59,824 --> 01:00:00,747
Hey little man !

1179
01:00:04,041 --> 01:00:06,070
Julie told us that you are through a living hell...

1180
01:00:10,467 --> 01:00:13,124
When i opened the Post office, it's still the night!

1181
01:00:13,124 --> 01:00:14,768
It's sunny at about 11:30 am !

1182
01:00:14,768 --> 01:00:16,653
And at 5 pm , suddenly , night !

1183
01:00:17,965 --> 01:00:21,995
They are all... depressed, whites , miserables...

1184
01:00:22,205 --> 01:00:23,808
Yes, they have not enough light...

1185
01:00:23,808 --> 01:00:26,244
And moreover the hygiene... Last week, a begining of a desease !

1186
01:00:26,776 --> 01:00:29,549
The... The cholera !

1187
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:31,901
Cholera !

1188
01:00:31,901 --> 01:00:32,778
Cholera!?

1189
01:00:32,778 --> 01:00:33,776
yes...

1190
01:00:34,391 --> 01:00:35,526
Have you done your vaccines?

1191
01:00:35,964 --> 01:00:37,185
I have to !

1192
01:00:37,495 --> 01:00:39,229
We have to check !

1193
01:00:39,229 --> 01:00:40,901
The North is worst than the hell !

1194
01:00:40,901 --> 01:00:42,653
Weird... i used to work in the north...

1195
01:00:42,653 --> 01:00:44,623
I had such a great memory !

1196
01:00:58,673 --> 01:01:00,184
For the Easter week end, we may go to Belgium!

1197
01:01:00,184 --> 01:01:01,871
Why not?

1198
01:01:03,685 --> 01:01:04,435
i have to work..

1199
01:01:05,776 --> 01:01:06,404
What's wrong?

1200
01:01:06,404 --> 01:01:08,059
It embarassed you by seeing us?

1201
01:01:08,059 --> 01:01:09,238
no, not at all !

1202
01:01:09,238 --> 01:01:09,934
So what?

1203
01:01:09,934 --> 01:01:10,933
Kiss me !

1204
01:01:10,933 --> 01:01:12,339
Listen , it's ridiculous...

1205
01:01:12,339 --> 01:01:13,216
See you tonight !

1206
01:01:13,216 --> 01:01:14,199
Kiss me !

1207
01:01:14,199 --> 01:01:14,749
You hurt me!

1208
01:01:14,749 --> 01:01:16,153
Is there a problem , annabelle?

1209
01:01:16,153 --> 01:01:17,673
No , I'm okay !

1210
01:01:18,018 --> 01:01:19,025
What's wrong with the postman?

1211
01:01:19,652 --> 01:01:20,653
A problem?

1212
01:01:20,653 --> 01:01:21,936
You've got mails for me?

1213
01:01:21,936 --> 01:01:22,965
Stop.. Tony !

1214
01:01:22,965 --> 01:01:23,675
Shut up...

1215
01:01:23,675 --> 01:01:24,593
No I haven't...

1216
01:01:24,593 --> 01:01:25,559
But I have a text message...

1217
01:01:25,559 --> 01:01:27,685
As you don't know to read, I'll tell you...

1218
01:01:27,685 --> 01:01:28,719
Antoine stop it !

1219
01:01:30,173 --> 01:01:33,448
" it's forbidden to park in front of the Post Office , cheers the postman "

1220
01:01:34,325 --> 01:01:35,902
hey , is your mom here?

1221
01:01:36,544 --> 01:01:37,839
is she cleaning your room?

1222
01:01:39,674 --> 01:01:40,933
No no no stop ...

1223
01:01:40,933 --> 01:01:42,433
What's wrong bellringer, you wanna fight?

1224
01:01:42,433 --> 01:01:44,592
No, I'm against the violence between humans...

1225
01:01:44,592 --> 01:01:46,448
But about the objects....

1226
01:01:47,642 --> 01:01:48,774
Damn !

1227
01:01:49,683 --> 01:01:50,796
Are you insane?

1228
01:01:52,674 --> 01:01:53,516
Stop !

1229
01:01:55,308 --> 01:01:56,060
Antoine !

1230
01:01:56,827 --> 01:01:58,455
Stop that, Help me guys !

1231
01:01:58,777 --> 01:01:59,550
Stop Bailleul!

1232
01:02:03,092 --> 01:02:03,496
Stop !

1233
01:02:06,714 --> 01:02:07,574
Sir...?

1234
01:02:08,166 --> 01:02:08,873
Sir?

1235
01:02:09,342 --> 01:02:10,144
He does not look fine...

1236
01:02:10,144 --> 01:02:11,059
No , it's ok...

1237
01:02:11,059 --> 01:02:11,952
Look he is not aware...

1238
01:02:11,952 --> 01:02:12,936
It's OK !

1239
01:02:12,936 --> 01:02:14,058
Come on Sir...

1240
01:02:18,816 --> 01:02:19,816
He can't say no !

1241
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:22,067
You know , you understand...

1242
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:24,963
You know, people are happy when the post man arrives...

1243
01:02:26,192 --> 01:02:28,098
" Would you like to take a drink Antoine? "

1244
01:02:28,694 --> 01:02:30,193
Then....

1245
01:02:30,193 --> 01:02:32,661
Then... He fights in front of the post office ! that's serious !

1246
01:02:33,526 --> 01:02:35,019
He might say no , but i can say stop !

1247
01:02:35,246 --> 01:02:37,443
A reprimand? Maybe too much , Sir

1248
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:39,222
You won't take his defense, right?

1249
01:02:39,222 --> 01:02:40,798
no i'm not !

1250
01:02:42,065 --> 01:02:43,474
I just want him to be good...

1251
01:02:43,474 --> 01:02:45,992
it won't fix everything if you give him a reprimand...

1252
01:02:45,992 --> 01:02:48,236
You know what is the real problem of Antoine Bailleul?

1253
01:02:48,846 --> 01:02:50,253
he is in love with you !

1254
01:02:53,049 --> 01:02:53,973
Actually....

1255
01:02:54,869 --> 01:02:56,314
We used to be together for a year...

1256
01:02:56,755 --> 01:02:57,775
Why did you dump him?

1257
01:02:58,595 --> 01:02:59,681
He dumbed me...

1258
01:03:00,661 --> 01:03:01,681
i don't get it..

1259
01:03:01,881 --> 01:03:03,252
I was very happy with him...

1260
01:03:04,129 --> 01:03:07,244
one day , I had an argue with his mother who is a bit...instrusive...

1261
01:03:07,244 --> 01:03:09,253
I was very upset...

1262
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:11,564
i told Antoine to choose....

1263
01:03:12,222 --> 01:03:12,970
He chose...

1264
01:03:13,193 --> 01:03:15,442
What i have to do?  I'm the director of the post office.. not  a social worker...

1265
01:04:11,407 --> 01:04:12,292
It's beautiful Antoine....

1266
01:04:12,945 --> 01:04:13,633
Go ahead !

1267
01:04:20,839 --> 01:04:24,010
You are gonna give me a musical diploma or a reprimand?

1268
01:04:24,790 --> 01:04:25,845
Why don't you talk to your mother?

1269
01:04:26,304 --> 01:04:26,930
My mother?

1270
01:04:27,836 --> 01:04:28,932
i talked with Annabelle...

1271
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:31,399
It's the relation with your mother which cause all your problems...

1272
01:04:31,633 --> 01:04:32,697
no...

1273
01:04:33,499 --> 01:04:34,447
Antoine...

1274
01:04:38,017 --> 01:04:41,002
My mother... i have to help her, she had a difficult life...

1275
01:04:41,738 --> 01:04:44,128
It's not helping her, if you don't tell her what you really think about her....

1276
01:04:46,806 --> 01:04:48,244
If you want to be relieved, we are all like you...

1277
01:04:48,244 --> 01:04:49,472
My wife.. I love her !

1278
01:04:49,472 --> 01:04:51,187
But i spend all my week end liying to her....

1279
01:04:51,187 --> 01:04:51,959
What?

1280
01:04:52,222 --> 01:04:53,583
Too long to explain...

1281
01:04:54,251 --> 01:04:55,688
i didn't know that you were married....

1282
01:04:56,283 --> 01:04:56,939
Thank you!

1283
01:04:57,241 --> 01:05:00,344
If you are married , why does your wife not come here to live with you?

1284
01:05:02,003 --> 01:05:03,337
My wife is...

1285
01:05:05,033 --> 01:05:08,129
Rather depressed.... Even depressive... 

1286
01:05:09,586 --> 01:05:11,900
That's why if she came in the North it could be worse....

1287
01:05:12,118 --> 01:05:12,993
Why?

1288
01:05:12,993 --> 01:05:16,407
Hum... It could be worse for her... to leave her town.

1289
01:05:16,879 --> 01:05:17,843
in all places...

1290
01:05:19,595 --> 01:05:20,335
ok..

1291
01:05:20,335 --> 01:05:21,367
look Antoine...

1292
01:05:21,367 --> 01:05:24,336
I ask you to be careful during the work times...

1293
01:05:24,753 --> 01:05:27,844
it won't help you for your problems if you drink... it's even worse...

1294
01:05:28,846 --> 01:05:30,377
i behave like a "babache"...

1295
01:05:31,533 --> 01:05:32,909
We all do mistakes....

1296
01:05:32,909 --> 01:05:35,147
By the way, when you realised them, you must fix them....

1297
01:05:36,003 --> 01:05:37,616
If you can fix them...

1298
01:05:37,929 --> 01:05:39,459
It's always retrievable...

1299
01:05:39,991 --> 01:05:41,594
Except... his motor bike !

1300
01:05:43,961 --> 01:05:44,968
you wanna try?

1301
01:05:45,217 --> 01:05:45,929
What?

1302
01:05:46,159 --> 01:05:47,784
Playing the peals of bells...

1303
01:05:47,784 --> 01:05:48,561
No...

1304
01:05:48,812 --> 01:05:49,472
Why?

1305
01:05:49,472 --> 01:05:51,533
You might know a song, it's like a piano !

1306
01:05:52,897 --> 01:05:54,252
If I play, everybody will listen to it !

1307
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:56,344
then , we must take the headphones !

1308
01:05:57,937 --> 01:05:58,813
Go ahead " biloute "

1309
01:06:00,749 --> 01:06:01,576
Not this one !

1310
01:06:02,210 --> 01:06:03,253
oh my god...

1311
01:06:04,154 --> 01:06:04,877
Not easy...

1312
01:06:04,877 --> 01:06:05,720
More pitched...

1313
01:06:05,937 --> 01:06:07,656
yes...

1314
01:06:22,429 --> 01:06:25,270
Antoine , wait, I come with you !

1315
01:06:26,653 --> 01:06:27,872
i know the road...

1316
01:06:28,650 --> 01:06:29,621
i'm coming with you...

1317
01:06:30,039 --> 01:06:31,255
it's time to say " no" !

1318
01:06:32,183 --> 01:06:33,026
You are the boss !

1319
01:06:53,632 --> 01:06:54,379
Hey " biloute " !

1320
01:06:54,583 --> 01:06:55,442

1321
01:06:55,676 --> 01:06:56,369
Hello " tissote " !

1322
01:06:56,369 --> 01:06:58,285

1323
01:06:58,566 --> 01:06:59,868
it's really nice to say hello !

1324
01:07:00,256 --> 01:07:01,351
Come on in !

1325

01:15:49,412 --> 01:15:49,961
Julie...

1489
01:15:50,501 --> 01:15:52,487
I was silly, I was weak, forgive me....

1490
01:15:53,375 --> 01:15:54,033
What are all of these?

1491
01:15:54,281 --> 01:15:55,064
My suitcases !

1492
01:15:55,064 --> 01:15:56,063
I'm leaving with you!

1493
01:15:57,191 --> 01:15:58,281
What about Raphael?

1494
01:15:58,722 --> 01:16:02,473
My parents take him tonight, and there, we'll find a school !

1495
01:16:03,712 --> 01:16:05,334
What about the shop, your work....

1496
01:16:05,940 --> 01:16:06,992
I'm on vacation...

1497
01:16:07,335 --> 01:16:08,552
i want to live with you in the North !

1498
01:16:09,959 --> 01:16:11,251
No no Julie no!

1499
01:16:13,534 --> 01:16:15,752
I'm a bit afraid, but happy to come with you....

1500
01:16:16,838 --> 01:16:18,125
We will always be together now...

1501
01:16:20,438 --> 01:16:22,048
You'll see, together, we'll be stronger !

1502
01:16:29,241 --> 01:16:30,596
Have you put your belt?

1503
01:16:30,908 --> 01:16:31,847
yes, of course !

1504
01:16:33,712 --> 01:16:34,686
is he insane?

1505
01:16:55,851 --> 01:16:56,567
Well..

1506
01:16:57,410 --> 01:16:58,340
What was your speed?

1507
01:16:59,710 --> 01:17:00,346
Good one !

1508
01:17:00,620 --> 01:17:02,286
We will take you to the hospital !

1509
01:17:02,846 --> 01:17:04,067
My husband did not drink !

1510
01:17:04,067 --> 01:17:05,976
He has parfumed his mouth , maybe , that's it !

1511
01:17:06,180 --> 01:17:07,722
Don't worry my love, go with the  breakdown van !

1512
01:17:08,180 --> 01:17:08,987
No, i stay with you !

1513
01:17:08,987 --> 01:17:13,319
No , go home, check the car, the house, I'll take the train !

1514
01:17:13,691 --> 01:17:14,880
better...

1515
01:17:15,455 --> 01:17:16,275
Ok honey...

1516
01:17:16,275 --> 01:17:17,619
Be careful !

1517
01:17:17,849 --> 01:17:19,283
I join you as fast as possible !

1518
01:17:19,838 --> 01:17:20,460
Great !

1519
01:17:22,329 --> 01:17:23,109
Come into my office !

1520
01:17:24,619 --> 01:17:25,934
i need to talk to you all !

1521
01:17:27,610 --> 01:17:28,496
That serious....

1522
01:17:29,072 --> 01:17:29,854
What's going on?

1523
01:17:30,203 --> 01:17:31,015
my wife is coming tomorrow !

1524
01:17:31,496 --> 01:17:32,431
that's a good news !

1525
01:17:32,665 --> 01:17:33,778
no , not really !

1526
01:17:34,515 --> 01:17:35,463
You two are in good terms?

1527
01:17:35,463 --> 01:17:36,462
Yes , we are !

1528
01:17:37,650 --> 01:17:39,495
Since 1000 kilometers are between us, everything is perfect !

1529
01:17:42,274 --> 01:17:43,465
My wife is depressive ...

1530
01:17:45,154 --> 01:17:47,089
that helps so much that I live in the North...

1531
01:17:48,391 --> 01:17:50,197
that focus her mind in something concret....

1532
01:17:52,245 --> 01:17:53,454
tell me...

1533
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:54,790
I'm afraid not to understand....

1534
01:17:55,714 --> 01:17:58,362
Yes, i lied to you... She thinks that I'm living in hell...

1535
01:17:59,578 --> 01:18:00,493
that i'm depressed...

1536
01:18:00,729 --> 01:18:02,590
The more she looks after me, the more she gets better...

1537
01:18:02,923 --> 01:18:04,058
Weird story...

1538
01:18:04,058 --> 01:18:05,337
Maybe, but it works...

1539
01:18:05,337 --> 01:18:07,369
We have never been so happy since I lived in the Nord pas de Calais...

1540
01:18:08,088 --> 01:18:10,953
What did you say to her about us?

1541
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:17,556
Few " clichés "...

1542
01:18:19,329 --> 01:18:21,445
I have not invented...

1543
01:18:22,619 --> 01:18:25,086
I said that you were....

1544
01:18:25,768 --> 01:18:26,649
basics

1545
01:18:27,060 --> 01:18:28,494
a bit..

1546
01:18:28,733 --> 01:18:29,964
Simple...

1547
01:18:31,465 --> 01:18:32,856
a bit rude...

1548
01:18:34,169 --> 01:18:35,653
Sometimes vulgar...

1549
01:18:36,952 --> 01:18:38,358
Jerks....

1550
01:18:39,893 --> 01:18:41,243
Late....

1551
01:18:41,618 --> 01:18:43,149
And few things...

1552
01:19:26,082 --> 01:19:27,118
hello honey !

1553
01:19:36,908 --> 01:19:38,873
It's really pretty here !

1554
01:19:39,950 --> 01:19:42,761
My love, I have to tell you something..

1555
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:47,262
Welcome to the " ch'nord"....

1556
01:19:47,463 --> 01:19:48,564
Welcome !

1557
01:19:57,949 --> 01:19:59,949
Welcome to the "ch'nord"...

1558
01:20:06,544 --> 01:20:07,199
Come !

1559
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:20,928
Julie, Julie, Julie !

1560
01:20:26,755 --> 01:20:28,829
Need to drink !

1561
01:20:29,798 --> 01:20:31,359
Pretty wife !

1562
01:20:34,267 --> 01:20:34,893
Yep 

1563
01:20:43,161 --> 01:20:44,082
Fuck off !

1564
01:20:46,163 --> 01:20:47,058
Go home !

1565
01:20:47,431 --> 01:20:49,503
Look at that mess !

1566
01:20:50,769 --> 01:20:51,662
Where are we?

1567
01:20:52,210 --> 01:20:53,226
To bergues, honey...

1568
01:20:53,226 --> 01:20:54,133
We are arrived...

1569
01:20:54,524 --> 01:20:55,496
Ladies and gentlemen..

1570
01:21:10,995 --> 01:21:11,973
Who are all these guys?

1571
01:21:12,378 --> 01:21:13,848
Ther miners of the mine...

1572
01:21:17,070 --> 01:21:18,348
I thought the mines were stopped?

1573
01:21:18,631 --> 01:21:20,198
Not all, not this one..

1574
01:21:20,946 --> 01:21:23,679
Even if it's closed, we still live in there...

1575
01:21:24,348 --> 01:21:25,487
Where do you want us to go ?

1576
01:21:32,849 --> 01:21:35,224
"vindedious " what the hell...?

1577
01:21:50,891 --> 01:21:51,844
There, the town hall...

1578
01:21:52,810 --> 01:21:56,591
Right there, the Post Office, and in front of that, the party rooms, but there are not parties anymore..

1579
01:21:58,028 --> 01:21:59,219
It is worst than you told me...

1580
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:02,214
it's what i try to tell you at the station... I didn't want you to see this...

1581
01:22:24,575 --> 01:22:26,060
are you living there?

1582
01:22:26,344 --> 01:22:27,298
Yes...

1583
01:22:27,621 --> 01:22:29,357
But it's rather shiny!

1584
01:22:32,063 --> 01:22:35,142
i forgot to say... We eat at 9 am , you must not be late...

1585
01:22:38,498 --> 01:22:39,402
We don't eat together?

1586
01:22:39,857 --> 01:22:43,028
No... It's the welcoming meal, if we don't go there, i'll be in troubles...

1587
01:23:00,106 --> 01:23:01,339
Talk to them, they'll be happy...

1588
01:23:10,554 --> 01:23:11,770
It's great to eat outside...

1589
01:23:12,332 --> 01:23:15,012
We don't have to stay too late, because of the tigers....

1590
01:23:18,448 --> 01:23:19,332
What are we eating?

1591
01:23:19,834 --> 01:23:20,642
Meat...

1592
01:23:21,457 --> 01:23:22,320
What kind of meat?

1593
01:23:23,010 --> 01:23:24,176
it depends of what we find...

1594
01:23:26,301 --> 01:23:27,145
You'll see !

1595
01:23:30,144 --> 01:23:30,676
Damn!

1596
01:23:30,676 --> 01:23:31,410
miss !

1597
01:23:31,866 --> 01:23:34,071
it's ok , we have enough meat, come on eat !

1598
01:23:35,220 --> 01:23:35,988
I'm coming !

1599
01:23:43,082 --> 01:23:44,320
Dinner is ready !

1600
01:23:52,385 --> 01:23:53,034
Thank you .

1601
01:24:00,007 --> 01:24:00,707
I can't...

1602
01:24:01,427 --> 01:24:02,146
I can"t...

1603
01:24:02,477 --> 01:24:03,303
Give me some bread...

1604
01:24:21,023 --> 01:24:21,679
Tomorrow...

1605
01:24:22,359 --> 01:24:24,272
We'll go to the mine and play hide and seek.

1606
01:24:24,845 --> 01:24:26,677
Great !

1607
01:24:33,117 --> 01:24:34,721
You think they go to sleep in their mines?

1608
01:24:39,618 --> 01:24:41,237
i don't think so, it's only 1 am...

1609
01:24:45,322 --> 01:24:46,546
We hear the neighbors...

1610
01:24:47,495 --> 01:24:48,356
What are they saying?

1611
01:24:49,698 --> 01:24:50,650
An argue...

1612
01:24:50,650 --> 01:24:52,243
like every single nights...

1613
01:25:00,246 --> 01:25:02,291
This is it , problem is finished...

1614
01:25:03,071 --> 01:25:04,276
oh my god, someone is dead !

1615
01:25:04,641 --> 01:25:06,544
no , don"t worry he shoots in the ceiling to afraid his wife ...

1616
01:25:07,715 --> 01:25:10,058
What a nightmare...

1617
01:25:10,618 --> 01:25:12,181
How can you live this way for two years?

1618
01:25:14,087 --> 01:25:15,745
First, how did you do to live until now?

1619
01:25:18,151 --> 01:25:19,681
I'll take something...

1620
01:25:20,430 --> 01:25:22,117
You should go home, it's too hard for you..

1621
01:25:22,420 --> 01:25:23,716
I'll bring you to the station tomorrow...

1622
01:25:24,821 --> 01:25:25,640
ok...

1623
01:25:26,604 --> 01:25:28,117
in order to take the rest of my clothes.

1624
01:25:28,117 --> 01:25:28,776
What?

1625
01:25:28,978 --> 01:25:30,545
Raphael can't join us...

1626
01:25:31,394 --> 01:25:33,363
He will live two years to my parents's house..

1627
01:25:34,145 --> 01:25:35,458
I'll move here, with you...

1628
01:25:35,697 --> 01:25:36,363
It's not possible....

1629
01:25:36,576 --> 01:25:37,221
i don't want it !

1630
01:25:38,175 --> 01:25:38,898
I love you...

1631
01:25:39,397 --> 01:25:40,708
your life is mine....

1632
01:25:47,925 --> 01:25:48,540
so?

1633
01:25:49,072 --> 01:25:50,613
i can't hear anything.. maybe they're sleeping...

1634
01:25:51,096 --> 01:25:54,335
Maybe we can start a fire !

1635
01:25:55,460 --> 01:25:56,583
Are you mad?

1636
01:25:56,583 --> 01:25:58,036
Are you "babache"?

1637
01:25:58,522 --> 01:26:00,679
Anyway , all the thing I propose, you don't care...

1638
01:26:01,007 --> 01:26:02,101
no...

1639
01:26:03,128 --> 01:26:04,727
The shotgun was a good idea.

1640
01:26:05,038 --> 01:26:05,912
Ok I do it again !

1641
01:26:05,912 --> 01:26:06,727
No !

1642
01:26:06,727 --> 01:26:08,228
Yann, enough !

1643
01:26:09,145 --> 01:26:10,550
Let's go home.

1644
01:26:15,645 --> 01:26:16,549
Don't you come Antoine?

1645
01:26:17,237 --> 01:26:19,850
No , i stay here, Somebody has to stay here..

1646
01:26:20,459 --> 01:26:21,582
ye, it's true...

1647
01:26:22,487 --> 01:26:24,581
Annabelle wait !

1648
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:29,492
Is it better if you stay here?

1649
01:26:30,550 --> 01:26:31,112
Antoine...

1650
01:26:31,423 --> 01:26:32,285
Please...

1651
01:26:33,446 --> 01:26:37,706
No , because tomorrow, i'll be alone, it won't be work...

1652
01:26:37,706 --> 01:26:38,772
She will have doubts !

1653
01:26:38,772 --> 01:26:41,197
right now.. i'm the one who has doubts...

1654
01:26:43,262 --> 01:26:46,955
... The only moment where we are both In bergues, without my mother..

1655
01:26:49,739 --> 01:26:50,491
Good night.

1656
01:27:35,279 --> 01:27:36,168
So, are you okay?

1657
01:27:36,168 --> 01:27:36,752
no!

1658
01:27:37,065 --> 01:27:38,639
Neither do i...

1659
01:27:39,182 --> 01:27:40,168
Julie wants to stay here...

1660
01:27:40,655 --> 01:27:41,546
Here , in the North?

1661
01:27:41,546 --> 01:27:43,223
no , there , there ....

1662
01:27:43,223 --> 01:27:43,887
What?

1663
01:27:45,261 --> 01:27:46,858
You realize... We have done everything to disgust her...

1664
01:27:47,198 --> 01:27:48,578
And she agree to stay here...

1665
01:27:49,263 --> 01:27:50,184
But why?

1666
01:27:51,013 --> 01:27:52,089
Because she loves me.

1667
01:27:52,682 --> 01:27:54,033
"dubrin"...

1668
01:27:54,434 --> 01:27:58,135
I have fought for many years in order to live in the South and fix our couple problems..

1669
01:27:58,371 --> 01:28:00,622
And everything is getting better, here, in the North

1670
01:28:01,310 --> 01:28:02,701
Good for you , if everything is getting better.

1671
01:28:02,701 --> 01:28:03,480
What I am supposed to do?

1672
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:04,698
She does not want to leave this hole !

1673
01:28:05,464 --> 01:28:06,512
Why don't you tell her the truth?

1674
01:28:06,761 --> 01:28:07,542
No...

1675
01:28:08,108 --> 01:28:10,344
I realized that my wife loved me, I don't want to make her upset...

1676
01:28:10,982 --> 01:28:11,651
Coward !

1677
01:28:11,651 --> 01:28:12,483

1679
01:28:13,276 --> 01:28:17,379
Your wife loves you, you too, so be true and tell her what you really have to say !

1680
01:28:17,379 --> 01:28:18,250
Antoine !

1681
01:28:18,792 --> 01:28:22,482

1682
01:28:22,683 --> 01:28:24,450

1683
01:28:24,450 --> 01:28:25,980

1684
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:29,431

1685
01:28:29,431 --> 01:28:30,341
Go ahead !

1686
01:28:31,108 --> 01:28:33,197
Go talk to your wife instead of telling me what i have to do !

1687
01:28:33,197 --> 01:28:35,151
OK i am busy with my wife, you with your mother !

1688
01:28:38,062 --> 01:28:38,480
Please?

1689
01:28:43,753 --> 01:28:44,670
Julie?

1690
01:28:46,124 --> 01:28:46,545
Julie !

1691
01:28:46,845 --> 01:28:47,733
Madam Abrahams?

1692
01:28:49,297 --> 01:28:49,890
Julie !

1693
01:29:01,655 --> 01:29:02,534
How may i help you madam?

1694
01:29:03,172 --> 01:29:05,266
I'm a bit lost, where is the Post office of Bergues?

1695
01:29:05,516 --> 01:29:06,201
Bergues?

1696
01:29:07,673 --> 01:29:08,795
It's not here...

1697
01:29:09,158 --> 01:29:10,125
We are in Bergues , aren't we?

1698
01:29:10,125 --> 01:29:11,343
No we're not...

1699
01:29:11,343 --> 01:29:12,735
It is the old miner city here....

1700
01:29:12,969 --> 01:29:14,357
Bergues is right there, far away...

1701
01:29:15,140 --> 01:29:15,797
Really?

1702
01:29:16,513 --> 01:29:17,372
Thank you.

1703
01:29:18,235 --> 01:29:19,044

1704
01:29:20,014 --> 01:29:20,967

1705
01:29:22,295 --> 01:29:24,201
Get it, don't be afraid, i won't eat you .

1706
01:29:51,730 --> 01:29:52,462
My wife has disapeared...

1707
01:29:53,165 --> 01:29:55,166
no no, she is waiting for you, she is upstairs...

1708
01:29:56,686 --> 01:29:58,008
I had to tell her everything...

1709
01:30:15,310 --> 01:30:17,038
It's not " Versailles " but i live correctly...

1710
01:30:19,447 --> 01:30:21,978
It's the ch'tis who borrowed me some furnitures, they are very nice with me...

1711
01:30:23,884 --> 01:30:25,538
it has been months that you are telling me craps...

1712
01:30:26,039 --> 01:30:28,683
Many times I tried to tell you the truth, but i couldn"t.

1713
01:30:28,912 --> 01:30:30,479
I told you what you wanna hear..

1714
01:30:30,870 --> 01:30:32,522
You did all that stuff because you didn't want me here.

1715
01:30:33,728 --> 01:30:35,428
The less we see each other, everything gets better.

1716
01:30:43,398 --> 01:30:44,991
We separated in order to be a better couple.

1717
01:30:45,694 --> 01:30:46,256
Right?

1718
01:30:50,617 --> 01:30:51,819
I have to go back to the South

1719
01:30:57,005 --> 01:30:58,318
So, mister " biloute"

1720
01:30:59,112 --> 01:31:00,412
You've got some mails for your mother?

1721
01:31:01,457 --> 01:31:02,863
No, I need to talk with you mom.

1722
01:31:03,178 --> 01:31:03,989
What's going on?

1723
01:31:03,989 --> 01:31:04,785
Are you sick?

1724
01:31:05,489 --> 01:31:06,972
You have catched a disease?

1725
01:31:07,798 --> 01:31:08,170
No no mom...

1726
01:31:12,984 --> 01:31:14,113
I want you to listen what i have to tell you

1727
01:31:14,334 --> 01:31:15,431
Don't reply, i want you to listen...

1728
01:31:15,431 --> 01:31:17,581
And if you have something to say, it won't change things...

1729
01:31:17,581 --> 01:31:19,607
Because what i have to tell you is like that et you can't talk !

1730
01:31:19,983 --> 01:31:20,582
Ok?

1731
01:31:20,582 --> 01:31:21,627
I didn't say anything !

1732
01:31:22,283 --> 01:31:22,845
Yea

1733
01:31:24,657 --> 01:31:25,392
So...

1734
01:31:25,612 --> 01:31:26,515
I'll leave the house..

1735
01:31:27,719 --> 01:31:29,094
I'll buy a flat...

1736
01:31:29,326 --> 01:31:30,654
And i will move with Annabelle

1737
01:31:30,654 --> 01:31:32,148
Even if you don't like her...

1738
01:31:32,420 --> 01:31:33,142
I love her

1739
01:31:33,142 --> 01:31:34,686
And she is the one that i have chosen.

1740
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:35,404
Here

1741
01:31:36,173 --> 01:31:38,018
What do you have to say?

1742
01:31:38,859 --> 01:31:40,221
Well ... Finally you did it !

1743
01:31:40,468 --> 01:31:42,779
I was wondering when you were able to ask me that !

1744
01:31:44,578 --> 01:31:46,515
Aren't you upset?

1745
01:31:46,985 --> 01:31:48,562
Why , i have to be?

1746
01:31:49,531 --> 01:31:51,187
I have all a mother dreams...

1747
01:31:51,421 --> 01:31:53,718
That her son finds his own happiness.

1748
01:31:55,845 --> 01:31:57,470
I didn't raise you for myself

1749
01:31:59,623 --> 01:32:02,687
And if you can do a little " biloute "

1750
01:32:03,531 --> 01:32:05,315
Or a little girl " biloute "

1751
01:32:05,315 --> 01:32:07,221
I'll be so glad , you know.

1752
01:32:08,592 --> 01:32:09,141
Ok?

1753
01:32:11,780 --> 01:32:12,514
Ok...

1754
01:32:14,187 --> 01:32:16,770
Is it the only thing you gotta ask me , because I have to finish my potatoes.

1755
01:32:18,981 --> 01:32:19,638
Thank you !

1756
01:32:33,528 --> 01:32:34,606
Think about it...

1757
01:32:37,057 --> 01:32:38,808

You won my boy !

1766
01:33:23,124 --> 01:33:25,056
I leave him alone.

1767
01:33:26,582 --> 01:33:27,791
It's over !

1768
01:33:28,141 --> 01:33:29,354
I won't watch him anymore.

1769
01:33:30,759 --> 01:33:31,965
Beyond this day..

1770
01:33:33,494 --> 01:33:34,901

We know each other with Annabelle on this song !

1776
01:34:10,728 --> 01:34:11,974
The singer comes from here !

" Ch'tivie Wonder"

1778
01:34:14,893 --> 01:34:16,972
I'm sorry, I'm not in a mood to laugh....

1779
01:34:19,445 --> 01:34:21,865
By the way, I didn't ask you what happened with you?

1780
01:34:22,270 --> 01:34:23,037
perfect...

1781
01:34:23,037 --> 01:34:24,481
I dare to speak with my mother.

1782
01:34:24,728 --> 01:34:26,224
i told her I will marry Annabelle !

1783
01:34:26,582 --> 01:34:27,549
How did she react?

1784
01:34:28,331 --> 01:34:30,450
She wants us to make kids !

1785
01:34:31,565 --> 01:34:32,316
Great !

1786
01:34:33,258 --> 01:34:34,926
Now, I just have to warn Annabelle...

1787
01:34:36,926 --> 01:34:37,822
You didn't talk to her?

1788
01:34:38,362 --> 01:34:40,177
I can't, i'm afraid that she says no ...

1789
01:34:40,471 --> 01:34:41,801
Is she still with her biker?

1790
01:34:41,801 --> 01:34:42,742
Dunno.

1791
01:34:43,018 --> 01:34:43,772
Hope not.

1792
01:34:50,050 --> 01:34:51,690
Mister Abrahams? What's going on?

1793
01:34:51,896 --> 01:34:53,317
I need you Annabelle, really !

1794
01:34:53,677 --> 01:34:55,770

You stay here, don't move !

1797
01:35:23,690 --> 01:35:24,801
It's ok, she is downstairs...

1798
01:35:25,096 --> 01:35:25,689
Are you ready?

1799
01:35:25,689 --> 01:35:26,455
I'm nervous...

1800
01:35:26,455 --> 01:35:27,740
Go on ! " check la dedans " !

1801

" Annabelle , I love you, Marry me Biloute "

1802
01:36:24,044 --> 01:36:27,852
Before you give your answer, you just know that I leave my mother;

1803
01:36:28,558 --> 01:36:29,092
I know.

1804
01:36:30,418 --> 01:36:31,363
She told me.

1805
01:36:45,401 --> 01:36:46,686
That's really nice what you've done !

1806
01:36:47,518 --> 01:36:48,550
You liked it ?

1807
01:36:49,513 --> 01:36:51,432
You are stupid !

1808
01:37:49,130 --> 01:37:49,660
Julie?

1809
01:37:55,178 --> 01:37:57,366
When me met each other, we were living nowhere, we didn't care !

1810
01:37:57,694 --> 01:37:58,957
We were happy, because we were together.

1811
01:38:00,628 --> 01:38:01,489

1812
