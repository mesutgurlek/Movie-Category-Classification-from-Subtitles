1
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:15,065
Mr. Taransky...?

2
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:16,938
She's...

3
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,103
She's walking?

4
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:21,113
Don't tell me
She’s walking.

5
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:22,944
She can't walk.

6
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,911
- Nicola!
- This, this...

7
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:29,284
- Not this.
- Nicola!

8
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:31,448
- How was your massage?
- You're in breach.

9
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:33,788
- Cigarette.
- Is this about the new pages?

10
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,452
Because I made
the changes,

11
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:37,291
all the changes
you wanted.

12
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:39,797
You are virtually
in every scene.

13
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:42,835
It is not the size
of the role, Viktor.

14
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:45,427
Am l, or am I not
entitled

15
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:48,303
to the biggest trailer
on the lot? hmm?

16
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:50,638
It's the biggest
on earth.

17
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,473
I swear.

18
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:54,308
It's a 50-foot
Airstream.

19
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,314
They don't make them
any longer.

20
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:58,646
- Taller, Viktor.
- Taller?

21
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:00,345
- Taller!
- What?

22
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,251
Eh.

23
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,021
You've insulted me
for the last time.

24
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:08,958
You're right.
It's actually...

25
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:09,926
It's actually taller.

26
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:11,930
- You're right. It's amazing.
- Coffee!

27
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:14,057
Wait a minute.

28
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,602
The tires are
over inflated.

29
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:18,603
See? It's just this.

30
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:23,241
See? Look. here.

31
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:25,300
- The air comes right out.
- This is sad.

32
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:27,278
See? It's lower already.

33
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:29,611
Nicola, I beg you.
Don't do this to me.

34
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:31,946
You know,
I had three other offers.

35
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:33,952
I only signed on
to this picture...

36
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,784
- Out of loyalty.
- Well, then show me some.

37
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:38,380
They're going
to shut me down!

38
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,289
It's not working, Viktor.

39
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,123
I mean, my God!

40
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:44,459
The scene
with the thousand geese?!

41
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:46,624
I don't understand
this film!

42
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:49,725
Nobody is going
to understand this film.

43
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:52,669
I already put out a press release
citing creative differences.

44
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,673
So just let it go.

45
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:56,641
You went to the press?

46
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:58,540
Do we have everything?

47
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:00,408
All right.
You know what?

48
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,913
You're right.

49
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:04,609
You are right.
And when you're right, you're right.

50
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,743
- Thank you.
- Let me help you with these.

51
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:08,582
'Cause you oughta go.

52
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:10,589
- I don't deserve you.
- Oh.

53
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:12,591
This film doesn't
deserve you.

54
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:15,924
It deserves much,
much better than you!

55
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:17,587
Creative differences?

56
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:19,757
The difference is
you're not creative.

57
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:27,272
To hell, please.

58
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:42,988
Jack?

59
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,454
Jack, are you there?

60
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:48,118
She's good.

61
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:51,129
You can hardly tell
she's reading off a teleprompter.

62
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:52,630
I'm right here.

63
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:55,561
Right beside you.

64
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:00,369
Look.

65
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,266
I've analyzed this footage.

66
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:05,743
We've got everything
we need in the can already.

67
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:08,076
If I could just make
the proper adjustments,

68
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:11,310
we can finish
this film without her.

69
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:14,285
Viktor, according to the writ
her attorneys filed at noon today,

70
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:17,846
they'll sue if the film is released
with N icola in a single frame.

71
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,154
They will sue, Viktor.
They're serious.

72
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:21,591
So let's recast.

73
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:23,925
N icola Anders is
the only actress in the world

74
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:25,225
that could play that part.

75
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:27,289
- It's a remake, Hal.
- That's right.

76
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,494
N icola Anders is not
bigger than this picture.

77
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:31,867
Of course she is, Viktor.

78
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,838
No other name is going
to sign on now.

79
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:36,466
Who needs a name?
We'll cast an unknown.

80
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:38,567
I'm not going to play
opposite an unknown.

81
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:41,443
- We can't sell an unknown.
- The numbers don't work.

82
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:44,608
If we ever want to be in
the N icola Anders business again,

83
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:47,175
we have to cut our losses
and shelve the picture.

84
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:48,777
No!

85
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,948
I will not give in to that
blackmailing...

86
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:52,685
Viktor,
let's take a walk.

87
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,522
Ridiculous performance.

88
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:56,391
I told you she was bad.

89
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,225
No, yours in there.

90
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,495
Why do you always have to make
things so difficult for yourself?

91
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,058
Difficult?
I'm being difficult?

92
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,661
Yes. Mm-hmm.

93
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,840
Elaine, do you know
what these are?

94
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:12,070
Mike 'n' Ike's?

95
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,669
They're not just any
Mike 'n' Ike's,

96
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:15,236
These are cherry
Mike 'n' Ike's.

97
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,579
Do you know why l,
Viktor Taransky,

98
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,743
two-time Academy Award
nominated director...

99
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,753
Viktor, that was "Short Subject."

100
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:25,154
...overseeing the most cherished
movie project of my entire career,

101
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:27,089
am walking around with...
look, look, look...

102
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,094
pockets full
of these... things?!

103
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,323
I have a feeling
you're going to tell me.

104
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:34,889
I'm going to tell you why.
Because Ms. N icola Anders,

105
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:36,958
supermodel
with a SAG card,

106
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:39,197
has it written
in her contract

107
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:41,172
that all cherry
Mike 'n' Ike's

108
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,798
be removed
from her candy dish,

109
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:46,106
along with strict instructions
that any room she walks into

110
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,773
must have seven packs
of cigarettes waiting for her...

111
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,213
three of them opened;

112
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:52,774
that there be
a personal Jacuzzi

113
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,286
within 80 paces
of her dressing room;

114
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,289
and that any time
she travels,

115
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,757
her nanny must fly
with her first-class.

116
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:01,726
So, what's wrong
with that?

117
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:03,557
Elaine, she doesn't
have children.

118
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:06,029
Don't you see?
They're mocking us.

119
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:08,158
They're mocking...
we're at their mercy.

120
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:11,169
What happened?
I mean, we always had movie stars,

121
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:13,569
but they used to be
our stars, remember?

122
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,903
We were the ones who would
tell them what to do.

123
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:17,738
And we would tell them
what to wear,

124
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,744
- Who to date...
- That's what you want?!

125
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:21,404
When they
were under contract to us,

126
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,881
we could change their names
if we wanted to.

127
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,417
- More than once.
- Viktor,

128
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:27,077
do you realize
you're nostalgic

129
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:28,984
for an era you weren't
even born in?!

130
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,455
I do remember why I got
into this business.

131
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:34,516
- You seem to have forgotten.
- Oh, please. Come on.

132
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:36,585
N ew York... Cassavetes.
Remember?

133
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:38,425
- here we go.
- What were we doing?

134
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:40,523
We were trying to make
something important.

135
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,726
I don't know.

136
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:44,235
Shine a little light
in that darkened cinema.

137
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:46,032
It's called a projector.

138
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:48,403
Illuminate hearts and minds
with a ray of truth.

139
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:50,339
I thought that's
what we were doing.

140
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,777
I have good memories
of those days, too.

141
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:55,871
I do, but this isn't
about that...

142
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:57,108
or you, or me,

143
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:59,413
or some high-minded ideal.
This is business.

144
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:00,884
- Spare me.
- Look around.

145
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:02,887
Who do you think pays
for all of this?

146
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:04,718
This is about investment
and return.

147
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,452
I'm not interested
in investment and return!

148
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:08,357
I'm not interested
in who pays for anything!

149
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,555
I'm trying to make a movie!

150
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,292
I'm responsible
for this, Viktor.

151
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:15,095
Those days
in N ew York...

152
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:19,366
It's over, Viktor.

153
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:27,343
You're not renewing
my contract?

154
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:29,347
How can I?!

155
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:32,509
Your last three pictures tanked.

156
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:34,917
No bankable star is going
to work with you after this.

157
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:37,421
I mean, if you just
compromised a little.

158
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:43,360
Well, it's not every day
you're fired

159
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:45,260
by the mother
of your own child.

160
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,367
You and I both know
that I kept you on

161
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:52,927
after the divorce
for old time's sake.

162
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:56,099
And so you could still hold
your head up in front of Lainey.

163
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:58,939
- I fought for you.
- Yeah, well...

164
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,383
I'm sorry, Viktor.

165
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:36,414
Dad!

166
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,310
- Sweetheart.
- hey, Dad.

167
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:43,584
- How are you, honey?
- Good.

168
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:46,587
I'm sorry Mom canned you.

169
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:50,352
I'm going to finish
this picture.

170
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:52,761
Lainey, I'm going
to finish it.

171
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,597
Because it's important.

172
00:08:57,837 --> 00:08:59,862
I know you will, Dad.

173
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:01,770
You'reviktor Taransky.

174
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,534
I'm Viktor Taransky.

175
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:09,547
'Kay.
By e, Dad.

176
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:18,052
- hi, sweetheart.
- hey, Mom.

177
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:19,614
Are you okay?

178
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:21,887
I'm Viktor Taransky.

179
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:36,741
Mr. Taransky?

180
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:38,572
Mr. Taransky,
thank God.

181
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:39,906
I've been trying
to see you.

182
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:42,072
I've been calling.

183
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:44,082
Your assistant
won't put me through.

184
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,345
I told her it was a matter
of life and death.

185
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,910
I was afraid I wasn't going
to get to you in time.

186
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:51,081
Please, just...

187
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:53,057
- Keep your distance.
- I did it!

188
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,057
I did it!

189
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:56,117
I licked skin,
I licked hair,

190
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:59,323
- I licked every part of her.
- I'm going to call security.

191
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:01,423
I'll call security
if you don't back off.

192
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,900
I have her,
Mr. Taransky.

193
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,063
The answer
to your pray ers.

194
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:09,403
- The answer to this.
- I was misquoted.

195
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:11,602
I have your new leading-lady
right here.

196
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:14,271
In my pants.

197
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:18,449
Please, sir,
I don't know you.

198
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:21,782
- I don't know where you come from...
- It's me!

199
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:23,788
Mr. Taransky, don't...

200
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:25,483
Don't you recognize me?

201
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:28,925
The Future of Film Conference
in San Jose.

202
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:30,895
Remember that?
Hank.

203
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,988
Hank Aleno.

204
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:35,295
I was a keynote speaker.
You must remember my speech.

205
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,427
- "Who N eeds humans? "
- Right.

206
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:40,638
You were booed off
the stage.

207
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:43,607
- Whoa, that's got to be...
- Eight y ears ago.

208
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:45,940
And that whole time
I never left my computer.

209
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:47,980
U h-huh.
Good for you, Hank.

210
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:49,776
Well, it's good
and bad.

211
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:51,783
That's what caused this.
The ey e tumor.

212
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:54,581
- Microwaves from the s creen.
- I'm sorry.

213
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,485
Don't be,
because it was worth it.

214
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:00,123
You have to see her.

215
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:01,921
Oh, I've seen those.

216
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:04,120
- Not like this.
- I'll take care of that.

217
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,791
Yeah, well, you're talking
about a "s yn-thespian."

218
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,926
- A virtual actor.
- No, we call them "v ac-tors."

219
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:11,833
"Vac-tors"?
I need flesh.

220
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:13,428
- Flesh is weak.
- It can't be done.

221
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,940
It can be done.
With my new computer code,

222
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,771
it can be done.

223
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,437
You and me...

224
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,208
we can do this together.

225
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:24,112
I don't know anything
about computers.

226
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:27,778
See, that's why...
that's why you're so perfect.

227
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,117
You have something...

228
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,623
- That I don't have.
- What's that?

229
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,451
An ey e.

230
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,792
An ey e for performance.

231
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,797
You know the truth
when you see it.

232
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,060
I know.

233
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:44,694
I mean, I've seen
your movies.

234
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,635
I love your movies.

235
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,740
- You love my movies?
- "Straw God."

236
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,312
That changed my life.

237
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,644
You saw "Straw God"?

238
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,651
I have seen every frame
of your work.

239
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,583
You're the only
filmmaker

240
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:04,623
with the artistic
integrity...

241
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:08,289
to realize my vision.

242
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:12,927
You and me,
art and s cience...

243
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,028
We're the perfect
marriage.

244
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:18,263
Hank...

245
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:20,100
I've had
a rough day today.

246
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:21,764
But, I tell you what,

247
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:24,366
I'll call you
about this next week.

248
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:27,173
- We can talk.
- I won't be here in a week.

249
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:30,238
- The tumor is inoperable.
- I'll call you about it, okay?

250
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:33,285
That's what I'm trying to say.
The tumor is inoperable.

251
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,249
I'll be dead.

252
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:41,049
Well, I'm already dead.

253
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:50,828
Call me!

254
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:53,303
This week!

255
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,803
Please.

256
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:16,586
What do you mean
she won't work with me?

257
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:18,425
She's done nothing.

258
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:20,931
She doesn't have
a single credit to her name.

259
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,264
Better no credits
than a Taransky credit.

260
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:25,098
Art,
you don't understand.

261
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:27,696
I've mortgaged everything
to finish this film.

262
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:29,604
The creditors
are calling me.

263
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:31,609
they're at the door
for God's sake.

264
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:34,441
hello?

265
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:37,114
Damn it!

266
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:41,285
Mr. Taransky.

267
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:45,550
Mr. Taransky!

268
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:54,757
- Mr. Taransky!
- No, I'm not him!

269
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,462
- Mr. Taransky!
- I'm not him!

270
00:13:57,536 --> 00:13:58,662
Mr. Taransky!

271
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:00,898
Hank Aleno!

272
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:07,737
I represent the estate
of Mr. Hank Aleno.

273
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:12,246
It was his last wish
that you have this.

274
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:18,255
What is it?

275
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:19,916
I have no idea.

276
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:21,516
he wanted you
to have it.

277
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,249
Valarie!

278
00:15:58,023 --> 00:15:59,490
Valarie!

279
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,559
Valarie!

280
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:13,569
Valarie,
what are you running from?

281
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,732
From Valarie.

282
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:35,656
Jack, are you there?

283
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:41,432
Something like this
can happen and what...

284
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,333
was it for?

285
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:45,927
Why are we here?

286
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,504
Is that what
you're asking, Jack?

287
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:51,907
Why are we here?

288
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,044
No why...

289
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,074
just here.

290
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,381
Just here.

291
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:36,249
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

292
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:39,415
I know I may be guilty
of a crime,

293
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:44,019
but it was committed with
the purest of intentions.

294
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:47,088
I wanted to send a message

295
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,100
to the acting community

296
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:50,931
who...

297
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:53,267
put themselves above
the work,

298
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:55,806
who put themselves above me.

299
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:57,432
So, what did
you guys think?

300
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:59,602
So fake.

301
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:01,942
Totally artificial.

302
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:09,212
Like we're suppose to believe
that was 1 9th century Lisbon.

303
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:11,051
- Come on.
- Guys...

304
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:13,557
Who's looking at the sets
when she's on s creen?

305
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,058
Oh, y eah.

306
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:18,661
There he is.

307
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,595
That's my dad,
Viktor Taransky.

308
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:27,371
- She was magnificent.
- She's absolutely unreal.

309
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,066
Breathtaking.

310
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:31,439
She wasn't too...
cartoony, or anything?

311
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,442
The nun?

312
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:34,342
Or are you talking about
the mother?

313
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:37,314
A star like that, who cares about
the supporting cast?

314
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:39,816
Congratulations again.
She's not of thisearth.

315
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:42,820
- You should bevery proud.
- Oh, not of this earth.

316
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,484
And the rest of the film,
what did you think?

317
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:49,391
She's a miracle.
Where did you find her?

318
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,826
Well...

319
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:54,491
I saw her picture...
on the computer.

320
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:55,828
A computer?

321
00:18:57,236 --> 00:19:00,672
You really didn't notice
anything unusual about her?

322
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:02,764
Only her brilliance.
To be honest,

323
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:04,103
with what you had
to work with,

324
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:06,007
I was expecting
a train wreck.

325
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:08,638
- You really pulled it off.
- I did?

326
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:12,081
Yeah. I have a feeling Mom's
going to take you back after this.

327
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:16,249
Back on the lot.
That's what...

328
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,016
I know. I know.
Come on, let's go.

329
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:23,321
A dazzling new ingenue
has come from seemingly nowhere

330
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:25,330
to capture the hearts of movie-going
audiences around the world

331
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:27,298
to capture the hearts of movie-going
audiences around the world

332
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:30,767
in her debut film
"Sunrise, Sunset."

333
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,895
But who is Simone?

334
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:34,700
We know so little about her.

335
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:37,105
And why the secrecy?

336
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,974
All we know for sure
is that she was dis covered

337
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:42,411
by little-known director,
Viktor Tarinsky.

338
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:44,381
Taransky.

339
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:51,981
Simone!

340
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:53,991
Simone?

341
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,653
- Good to see you, too, Elaine.
- Where is she?

342
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:59,424
- She's not here.
- Why isn't she with you?

343
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:02,490
Why? Because she would never come
to something like this.

344
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:04,160
She's intensely priv ate.

345
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:06,363
Back to work, everyone.
She's not here.

346
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:08,633
hey, listen.
Have you read the reviews?

347
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,231
they're love letters.

348
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:13,608
Listen to this one.
Oh, here.

349
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,842
Simone has thevoice
of a young Jane Fonda,

350
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:18,678
the body
of Sophia Loren,

351
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,684
the grace of well,
Grace Kelly...

352
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:23,448
ha-ha...
and the face...

353
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,854
of Audrey hepburn
combined with an angel.

354
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,525
- Almost right.
- I can't wait to meet her.

355
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:31,688
Oh, I don't know
if that's going to happen.

356
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:33,856
Why not?

357
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:36,127
She is somewhat
of a recluse.

358
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:38,260
That's how she stays
so pure.

359
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:41,363
She isolates herself
in her art.

360
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,374
Viktor, it's my studio.

361
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:45,535
Elaine, it's my actor.

362
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:48,307
There are other studios.

363
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,245
There's only one Simone.

364
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:52,715
Okay, have it your way,
Viktor.

365
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,652
hello, Walter.

366
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:04,355
Nobody came in
or went out,

367
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,488
- Just like you said.
- Very good.

368
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:08,499
- Mr. Taransky?
- Yes?

369
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:11,559
Is Ms. Simone
coming in today?

370
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,006
She's already here.
She arrived before you got here.

371
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:18,406
She's going to leave
long after you're gone.

372
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:20,342
Remember,
under no circumstances

373
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:23,472
are you or anybody else
ever to enter this set

374
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:25,914
without my express
permission, understood?

375
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:27,417
Yes, sir.

376
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:29,351
Mr. Taransky?

377
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:31,616
What if it catches
on fire?

378
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:35,082
Let it burn.

379
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:22,270
Good morning, Simone.

380
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:27,370
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.

381
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:36,986
Simone, a star is...

382
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:39,683
digitized.

383
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:41,658
Do you know
what this means?

384
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:44,696
We have stepped
into a new dimension.

385
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:48,866
Our ability
to manufacture fraud

386
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:52,529
now exceeds our ability
to detect it.

387
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:56,139
I am the death of real.

388
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,301
...death of real.

389
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,438
...death of real.

390
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,183
Too much Meryl Streep.

391
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,327
A little less Streep.

392
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,498
And a little more...

393
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,596
Bacall.

394
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:27,763
Is this better,
Mr. Taransky?

395
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:29,773
Much.

396
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:31,331
While we're at it,

397
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,344
there's a little
something

398
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,744
I want to add
to your repertoire.

399
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,110
You've got the wrong
Holly Golightly.

400
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:41,846
Remember that thing
Audrey hepburn does

401
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,820
in "Breakfast at Tiffany's"?

402
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,353
How do I look?

403
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,404
Give me Audrey.

404
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:02,201
How do I look?

405
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:04,967
Perfect.

406
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:07,637
Perfect, Simone.

407
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:09,145
Perfect.

408
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:12,647
Oh, God.

409
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:16,285
I'm so relaxed
around you.

410
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:21,783
I'm so myself.

411
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:28,657
You did create me.

412
00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:32,669
I just brought someone
else's dream to life.

413
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,239
Mr. Taransky,

414
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:40,005
we both know I was nothing
without you.

415
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:42,342
I was computer code.

416
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:45,008
I was ones and zeros.

417
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:46,846
I was nothing.

418
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,187
Well...

419
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:53,190
that's true.

420
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:56,022
I don't want
to boast, but...

421
00:24:56,094 --> 00:24:59,689
Are you ever going to tell
the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?

422
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:02,933
I'm going tell
the truth about you.

423
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,128
Why wouldn't i?

424
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:07,603
Of course...

425
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:10,300
with Hank's tragic passing,

426
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,637
his secret did die
with him.

427
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:19,673
This is
a classic case of

428
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:23,653
technology in search
of an artist.

429
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,321
Someone with integrity,

430
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:29,826
someone with vision,
someone who can see.

431
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:34,498
See beyond
this irrational

432
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:36,158
allegiance
to flesh and blood.

433
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:37,792
Someone who can see

434
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:40,838
that with the rise
in the price of a real actor

435
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:43,670
and the fall in the price
of a fake,

436
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:46,677
that the s cales have tipped...

437
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:48,838
naturally in favor
of the fake.

438
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:54,647
Someone who can see

439
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,949
that if a performance
is genuine,

440
00:25:58,123 --> 00:26:00,353
it doesn't matter
if the actor's real or not.

441
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,124
And what's real anymore?

442
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:07,130
Most actors these days

443
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:09,132
have digital work done
to them.

444
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:12,192
It's a gray area.

445
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:16,139
The only real truth
is the work.

446
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:20,370
I'm going to tell
the truth about you

447
00:26:20,445 --> 00:26:22,811
after your next picture.

448
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,483
You're so beautiful.

449
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:39,329
You're too beautiful.

450
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:45,164
We're going to fix that.

451
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:08,022
Is this on?

452
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:13,696
I will not be taking any questions
regarding Simone.

453
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:15,756
I do, however,
have a statement

454
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:17,665
to read on her behalf.

455
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:23,807
"To Whom it May Concern:

456
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:26,400
I'm deeply grateful
for the extraordinary

457
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:29,413
public response
to Mr. Taransky's film.

458
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:32,814
At this time I will be
conducting no interviews,

459
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:35,409
or making
publicity appearances...

460
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:39,287
- This is unbeliev able.
- I politely request that the press

461
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:43,657
respect my priv acy and let
the work speak for itself.

462
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:45,525
Yours truly, Simone."

463
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:48,157
Viktor!
Who is Simone dating?!

464
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:50,030
Where did you find her?

465
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:53,127
- Is Simone her real name?
- Didn't I make it clear?

466
00:27:53,204 --> 00:27:55,001
No questions
regarding Simone.

467
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:57,200
We're just trying
to get some answers.

468
00:27:57,275 --> 00:27:59,266
I will make
my final statement.

469
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:03,838
Ms. Simone begins production
on her new film today...

470
00:28:03,915 --> 00:28:05,883
"Eternity Forever."

471
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:08,976
This is a project
which has been near and dear

472
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:12,148
to my heart since I wrote it

473
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:13,952
niney ears ago.

474
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,026
Thank you.

475
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:20,530
Would you answer
a question regarding Hank?

476
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,972
Hank?
Who asked me about Hank?

477
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,771
Funny, why is the movie
dedicated to Hank?

478
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:34,436
Are they involved?

479
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:41,478
they were at one time
inseparable. Yes.

480
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,287
And now?

481
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:47,381
Now...

482
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:50,292
sadly to say,
only in spirit.

483
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,459
Thank you.

484
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:18,951
Your car will be ready
in just a minute.

485
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:20,957
We gave you
a complimentary car wash.

486
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:23,118
- Oh, really?
- they're cleaning the engine now.

487
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:24,957
Thank you.

488
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:29,295
- Viktor, hey.
- Hal.

489
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:31,301
I am so happy for us.

490
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:32,961
The film, the chemistry.

491
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:34,629
Nothing against
N icola Anders,

492
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:36,799
but I think
that Simone and l,

493
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:38,809
we really worked
great together.

494
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:42,074
- You were never together.
- Still, the connection was undeniable.

495
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:43,637
You can't...

496
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:45,649
Look, I have not read
"Eternity Forever,"

497
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:47,309
but it is fantastic.

498
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:49,819
And I know I would be perfect
for the part of Clive.

499
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:51,321
- Clyde.
- Clyde, right.

500
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:53,448
That's what I'm talking about.
Yes, perfect.

501
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:55,618
Come on, man.

502
00:29:55,693 --> 00:29:57,991
Look, I ran into Simone
on the lot.

503
00:29:58,062 --> 00:29:59,825
- Really?
- Yes, really.

504
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:01,991
- She never mentioned it.
- She's bus y right now.

505
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:03,590
People coming at her
from all angles.

506
00:30:03,668 --> 00:30:05,499
Maybe she didn't want
you to know, huh?

507
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:08,800
I strongly sensed

508
00:30:08,873 --> 00:30:11,899
that she thought I would be
perfect for Clyde as well.

509
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,443
- Really?
- Strongly.

510
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:14,978
Excuse me.

511
00:30:15,046 --> 00:30:16,343
Sure.

512
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:18,348
hello?

513
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:20,850
Simone, it's so great
to hear from you.

514
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:22,352
How are you,
sweetheart?

515
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:25,014
You'll never guess
who I'm with.

516
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:28,718
- You met him on the lot the other day.
- It was more in passing.

517
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:30,351
No, you're not
even close.

518
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:32,623
Hal.

519
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:35,188
- Hal Sinclair.
- What's wrong now?

520
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:38,167
I'm getting nothing from her side
of the conversation.

521
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:40,136
No, I don't think
he put on weight.

522
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:43,766
Anyway, listen. Do you think he'd
be right for "Eternity Forever"?

523
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,776
he's not the right type?

524
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,005
You want to go
in another direction?

525
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:50,775
Well... we'll try and talk her
into it, don't worry.

526
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,441
Anything you can do.

527
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:55,111
- Anything.
- Yeah, listen, honey.

528
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:57,086
What is this,
some kind of jamming device?

529
00:30:57,155 --> 00:30:58,952
This is a bad place to talk.

530
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,548
Maybe he's just
talking to himself.

531
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:03,787
Taransky's not
that good an actor.

532
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,989
Honey, I know you want
to do charity work.

533
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:09,090
No, they've taken
special precautions.

534
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:11,431
Some kind
of new encryption.

535
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:13,493
Why would they do that?

536
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:18,966
Well, whatever it is...

537
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:21,068
it's dark.

538
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:24,108
Dark?

539
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:26,707
Yeah. Very.

540
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:28,308
All right,
we'll talk about it

541
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:30,684
at the beach house
this weekend.

542
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:41,289
- Can you ever stop doing that?
- Why?

543
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:42,890
You'll lose yourself
in that thing.

544
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:45,663
You gotta get out more.
How you gonna meet boys?

545
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,001
Dad, I know
plenty of boys.

546
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:49,699
You do? Who?

547
00:31:49,774 --> 00:31:51,036
Where do you meet them?

548
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:52,770
You meet them
in those chat rooms?

549
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:55,711
How do you know you're not talking
to some middle-aged freak?

550
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:58,374
Dad, I can spot a middle-aged
freak a mile away.

551
00:31:58,449 --> 00:32:01,009
It's beautiful today.
Let's go outside and eat.

552
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,645
And Lainey,
leave the computer, please.

553
00:32:03,721 --> 00:32:05,313
Okay.

554
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:14,588
Dad, it might be better
to eat inside.

555
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:16,327
Stay here.

556
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:22,038
What is this?

557
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:27,242
What the hell is going on?
What are you doing here?

558
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:30,543
- You're trespassing.
- You can't hide her forever!

559
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:34,244
Simone appears only
when I want her to appear!

560
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:35,581
Sounds like a prisoner.

561
00:32:35,653 --> 00:32:38,019
- What are you, holding her hostage?
- You're the hostage.

562
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:40,148
I mean, you look kind
of captive to me.

563
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:49,699
Lainey,
don't you ever wonder

564
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:51,632
where I'm really
hiding Simone?

565
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:54,365
Just as long as I know
where you are, Dad.

566
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:59,209
- By e, Dad.
- By e, honey.

567
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:01,142
hello, Viktor.

568
00:33:01,212 --> 00:33:03,476
Sorry I got her back late.

569
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:05,482
Oh, no problem.

570
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,313
hey, you want
to come in?

571
00:33:14,892 --> 00:33:16,484
- hi.
- hi, Honey.

572
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:18,756
- hi, Vik.
- Kent.

573
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,160
Viktor, we simply
have to dis cuss

574
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:25,168
"Eternity Forever."

575
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:28,171
I still haven't received
Simone's s cript notes.

576
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:30,503
There aren't any.

577
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:32,372
If the filmmakers
are happy,

578
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:34,343
she's happy.

579
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:38,246
She considers herself,
you know, an instrument.

580
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:40,648
So she's really going
to do all this nudity?

581
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:42,583
It's on the page.

582
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:44,484
We have to do something
about this budget.

583
00:33:44,555 --> 00:33:45,954
It's completely
unrealistic.

584
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,356
You allowed nothing
for limousine service.

585
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:50,917
- She drives herself.
- U h-huh.

586
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:53,793
- Hair and make-up?
- Does her own.

587
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,857
- Theater training.
- Oh, she was in the theater?

588
00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:57,866
Where?

589
00:33:57,935 --> 00:33:59,562
You want her resume?
I'll send it to you.

590
00:33:59,637 --> 00:34:01,502
Okay, great. Thanks.

591
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:03,972
At least, Viktor,
contingency for wardrobe.

592
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,907
Anybody can go up a size.

593
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:07,774
I guarantee she will not
gain an ounce.

594
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:09,574
She is so dis ciplined.

595
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:11,842
Well, we've gotta do
something about this...

596
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:14,248
- "Stuntwoman."
- What about it?

597
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:17,116
- Well, there isn't one.
- She doesn't need one.

598
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:19,850
- Does all her own stunts.
- even the fall from the plane?

599
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:21,983
- even the fall from the plane.
- Oh.

600
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,857
Shoot it
on the last day.

601
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:26,021
Listen, Viktor.

602
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:29,157
I want to talk to you now,
not as Elaine, Studio head,

603
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:33,499
but as Elaine, ex-wife.
hey, second ex-wife.

604
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,174
Seriously.
You got lucky this last time.

605
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,836
But you need
to be careful.

606
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,472
We both know you wouldn't be
making this overblown art film

607
00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:46,278
if you hadn't convinced
Simone to be in it.

608
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:48,851
Elaine...

609
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:52,555
talking to you now,
not as Viktor, Director,

610
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:55,990
but as Viktor,
your first former husband,

611
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,456
what happened to you? huh?

612
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:03,125
Experience, Viktor.

613
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:05,135
That's what happened
to me.

614
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:06,966
Yeah, I've seen this
a hundred times.

615
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:09,700
- Really?
- Yeah.

616
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:12,368
These young stars
destroying

617
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:14,343
thevery people
who dis covered them.

618
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:16,573
I'm worried about you,
that's all.

619
00:35:16,647 --> 00:35:19,241
This woman,
she controls your destiny.

620
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:20,750
She doesn't control
my destiny.

621
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:22,979
There's something
about her I don't trust.

622
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:31,995
hi, Jane.

623
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:34,031
Thanks for taking me back,
Mr. Taransky.

624
00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:36,658
I know that it looked like
I sided with the studio,

625
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:38,668
but I've always believed
in you. Honestly.

626
00:35:38,736 --> 00:35:40,328
Don't worry.
I understand.

627
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:42,338
- Are they...
- they're all here.

628
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:44,499
Okay, thank you.
hello.

629
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:46,668
Viktor.

630
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:48,678
I just want to say
I am delighted

631
00:35:48,746 --> 00:35:52,273
to have such
a wonderful cast

632
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:55,012
assembled here
for "Eternity Forever."

633
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:56,610
A reminder:

634
00:35:56,687 --> 00:35:59,349
as a condition for working
on this picture,

635
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:01,857
you will not be rehearsing
with Simone.

636
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:04,360
You will not be shooting
with Simone.

637
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:07,795
Actually, you are forbidden
from contacting Simone

638
00:36:07,865 --> 00:36:10,299
at any time, for any reason,
whatsoever.

639
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,700
- Works for me.
- How will you shoot our love s cenes?

640
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:14,965
- Body double.
- For her?

641
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:17,030
For you.

642
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:20,600
Anyway, Simone insisted
on speaking with you herself

643
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,145
before filming started.

644
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:24,647
I believe she's on the line now.
Simone, are you there?

645
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:26,808
I certainly am,
Mr. Taransky.

646
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:31,020
So are we, Simone.

647
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:34,489
Why don't you leave me alone
with my co-stars, Mr. Taransky,

648
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:36,652
so we can get to know
each other better?

649
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:38,524
Absolutely.
I'll be back in a minute.

650
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:40,188
H i, who's there?

651
00:36:40,264 --> 00:36:42,824
Don't be shy.
Introduce yourselves.

652
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:50,498
I'm Mac.

653
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:52,634
I turned down
a Bertolucci film to be here.

654
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:56,513
hi, Simone.
I'm Corel.

655
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:58,515
hi, I'm Claris.

656
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:00,778
You used to date
my cousin, Dell.

657
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:02,443
I'm hewlitt.

658
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,613
We can rehearse in priv ate
if you like.

659
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:07,920
My name is Lotus.

660
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:10,119
God, I can't believe
I'm talking to you.

661
00:37:10,194 --> 00:37:12,628
We are going to become
such great friends.

662
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:14,460
hi, Simone, it's Hal.

663
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:16,966
It's great to be working
together... again.

664
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:18,797
Is that everyone?

665
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:22,464
Well, ob viously,
as you know, I'm Simone.

666
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:25,107
Who else?

667
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:27,235
I just want to start

668
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:29,802
by apologizing
for my process.

669
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,939
I know it's an unusual way
to work,

670
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:34,450
but I just find
I relate better to people

671
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:36,179
when they're not
actually there.

672
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:38,188
Oh, of course.
Of course.

673
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,156
I don't have much to say,

674
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:43,591
Except, that I know
it's gonna be a great project

675
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:48,496
if we all just trust
Mr. Taransky's vision.

676
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:51,831
Always do
what Mr. Taransky says.

677
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:55,861
If in doub t,
do it the Taransky way.

678
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,875
I know we're gonna make
a wonderful movie together.

679
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,411
Together.

680
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:03,208
Absolutely.

681
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:28,270
Veronica.

682
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:34,644
What you don't understand,
Clyde, is that love...

683
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:36,009
Still too big.

684
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,980
I like it,
but it's too big.

685
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:41,309
All right.
Smaller teardrops this time.

686
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:52,086
What you don't understand,
Clyde,

687
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:55,963
is that love
is like a wildflower.

688
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:59,196
But that flower only grows

689
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:01,101
on the edge...

690
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:04,733
of a very high cliff.

691
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,367
Perfect.

692
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:08,434
Perfect.

693
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:12,772
Simone. Simone.

694
00:39:14,151 --> 00:39:15,448
Simone.

695
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,950
Gonna be a little change
in plans, Simone.

696
00:39:23,627 --> 00:39:26,289
You have no idea
the effect

697
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,389
your performance
is having on people.

698
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:30,593
We can't stop now.

699
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:33,330
These films,
they're speaking

700
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:35,304
to the human condition.

701
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,065
We're changing lives.

702
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:44,844
People need to believe
you're real.

703
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,415
To reveal the truth now,

704
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:50,420
it would be too cruel.

705
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:56,321
You're gonna get in
a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.

706
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,487
Now, why do you have
to bring that up?!

707
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,665
I mean,
everything's a risk.

708
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:05,065
But it's worth it,
isn't it?

709
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,000
We've done
enough work today.

710
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,512
You've been cooped up
in there too long.

711
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:19,014
So how about...

712
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,711
you and I going
out on the town?

713
00:40:23,854 --> 00:40:26,186
Tonight, they're going
to see you

714
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,157
with their own ey es.

715
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,336
Excuse me.

716
00:40:40,404 --> 00:40:43,862
I will be checking in
a very special guest.

717
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:47,377
- A Ms. Enomis.
- Ah, Ms. Enomis.

718
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:52,206
Now, Ms. Enomis
demands her priv acy.

719
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:55,582
So, you will switch off
all surveillance cameras.

720
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:58,747
I alone, will es cort
Ms. Enomis to her room

721
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:00,688
via the rear exit.

722
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:02,817
She must not be disturbed
at any time,

723
00:41:02,893 --> 00:41:04,520
for any reason whatsoever.

724
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:07,155
I'm sure I can rely
on your dis cretion.

725
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:09,889
U nderstood, sir.

726
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:13,494
Thank you.

727
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:22,004
There she is!

728
00:42:35,085 --> 00:42:36,677
Who is it?

729
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:38,745
It's Simone.

730
00:42:50,334 --> 00:42:52,461
Okay, I think
everybody's here.

731
00:42:52,536 --> 00:42:54,265
Now!

732
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:06,812
I think we're
all right now.

733
00:43:10,187 --> 00:43:11,984
Oh, thank God
for you, Faith.

734
00:43:12,056 --> 00:43:13,887
Thank God for you.

735
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:17,689
This is way above
and beyond

736
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:19,922
the call of duty
for a stand-in.

737
00:43:19,997 --> 00:43:22,625
I must tell you,
you have no idea

738
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,998
the service you've
performed for Simone,

739
00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:27,299
shielding her
from these animals.

740
00:43:27,371 --> 00:43:29,498
Oh, no, Mr. Taransky.
Thank God for you.

741
00:43:29,573 --> 00:43:30,835
- For me?
- Yeah.

742
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:32,341
How many directors
would go

743
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:34,343
to so much trouble
to protect an actress?

744
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:35,901
It's incredible.

745
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:40,550
You know,
we're gonna have

746
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,085
to go back
to my place,

747
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:45,178
just to, you know,
keep them off the s cent.

748
00:43:46,423 --> 00:43:48,015
Of course.

749
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:54,587
You look so...

750
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:58,362
So much like...
um, like her?

751
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:02,029
Oh, y es, of course.
Like her.

752
00:44:02,106 --> 00:44:04,336
But you're
so very beautiful

753
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:06,273
in your own right.

754
00:44:12,282 --> 00:44:16,343
I do find myself strangely
attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.

755
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:20,819
Call meviktor.

756
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:23,458
Viktor.

757
00:44:23,527 --> 00:44:25,495
- Oh.
- Oh, Viktor.

758
00:44:30,567 --> 00:44:32,125
- Viktor.
- Yes?

759
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:34,261
- This is so exciting.
- Yes.

760
00:44:35,472 --> 00:44:37,599
Do what you do
to Simone?

761
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,734
What?
What did you say?

762
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:42,108
I said do whatever
you do to Simone.

763
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:45,742
What I do to Simone?

764
00:44:45,816 --> 00:44:47,613
Call me Simone!

765
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,277
Simone?

766
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,412
Yes. Say it again,
please.

767
00:44:51,488 --> 00:44:54,082
I want to know what it's like
to be her just for one night.

768
00:44:54,158 --> 00:44:55,989
Please, call me Simone.

769
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:59,655
You're with me so you can
be close to her?

770
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:01,357
Is that a problem?

771
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,634
Okay. Excuse me
just a minute.

772
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:07,466
Is something wrong?

773
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,733
Well, actually,

774
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:12,298
maybe we can do this
some other time

775
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:14,469
- Or something.
- Are you bus y tomorrow?

776
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:18,973
Gentlemen,
the Presidential Suite.

777
00:45:35,499 --> 00:45:37,433
Ahem...

778
00:45:41,638 --> 00:45:43,765
I think that should
take care of everything.

779
00:45:43,841 --> 00:45:45,331
Yes, sir.

780
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:47,775
I believe it will.

781
00:45:47,845 --> 00:45:50,006
Leave me for a moment.

782
00:46:07,364 --> 00:46:09,127
Simone.

783
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:27,138
- Brilliant.
- Elaine!

784
00:47:27,211 --> 00:47:29,645
- There she is.
- The picture...

785
00:47:29,713 --> 00:47:31,476
The picture.
It's a revelation.

786
00:47:31,548 --> 00:47:33,311
Thank you.
Thank you.

787
00:47:33,383 --> 00:47:35,112
We all worked
so hard.

788
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:38,484
- It was you.
- No, it was all of us.

789
00:47:38,555 --> 00:47:40,079
It was incredible.

790
00:47:40,157 --> 00:47:41,624
Thank you all.

791
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:58,367
Thank you.

792
00:47:59,476 --> 00:48:00,602
- Whoa!
- Viktor!

793
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:02,440
- Is she here?
- Viktor, is she here?

794
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:06,444
Oh, I'm fine, Hal.
How are you?

795
00:48:06,516 --> 00:48:07,949
Somebody
said she was here.

796
00:48:08,018 --> 00:48:09,986
Jesus.
That's her glass.

797
00:48:11,521 --> 00:48:14,456
Jack Daniels,
straight up.

798
00:48:14,524 --> 00:48:17,618
- My kind of woman.
- Come on, where is she?

799
00:48:17,694 --> 00:48:19,491
I don't know.
She's, uh...

800
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:21,292
Is that her
by the fountain?

801
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:24,460
You know,
between you and me,

802
00:48:24,534 --> 00:48:26,593
- She doesn't really exist.
- Simone!

803
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:29,138
- Simone!
- Simone's here?

804
00:48:29,206 --> 00:48:31,606
- Why didn't anybody tell me?
- She's here?!

805
00:48:31,675 --> 00:48:33,609
- Simone!
- I got your glass!

806
00:48:33,677 --> 00:48:35,770
I'm your biggest fan!

807
00:48:40,517 --> 00:48:42,747
Simone!

808
00:48:42,819 --> 00:48:44,684
- Simone!
- Simone?

809
00:48:53,964 --> 00:48:55,556
Get out!

810
00:48:58,568 --> 00:49:00,263
Not you two.

811
00:49:07,511 --> 00:49:12,972
She goes to a major
Hollywood A-list party

812
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:14,642
and we don't get
an interview,

813
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:17,812
a comment?
We don't even get a photograph?!

814
00:49:17,888 --> 00:49:19,879
Is that what
you're telling me?

815
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,515
Nobody got a photograph.

816
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:23,252
Nobody ever gets a photograph.

817
00:49:23,327 --> 00:49:25,352
We have our best people
on it, Mr. Say er.

818
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:26,589
Get better people!

819
00:49:27,764 --> 00:49:30,130
What about the 2 4-hour
tail on Taransky?

820
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:33,533
they're camped out every place
he goes; every concierge,

821
00:49:33,603 --> 00:49:35,434
every maitre d',
they're all on the take.

822
00:49:35,505 --> 00:49:37,405
But this Simone woman
is good.

823
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:39,806
Ob viously, that is not
her real name.

824
00:49:39,876 --> 00:49:41,639
She uses
an assumed identity.

825
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:43,304
She travels under
a false name.

826
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,314
She checks into
a hotel under an alias.

827
00:49:45,382 --> 00:49:48,317
N ever stays in the same place
two nights in a row.

828
00:49:48,385 --> 00:49:50,819
What about the satellite photos?
What happened?

829
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:58,323
- Nothin'.
- Nothing from space?!

830
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:01,655
What about
the fingerprints?

831
00:50:01,732 --> 00:50:04,326
What happened when we dusted
that whole hotel suite?

832
00:50:04,401 --> 00:50:06,835
Well, we have some
of Taransky's fingerprints,

833
00:50:08,572 --> 00:50:10,472
a lot of yours...

834
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:12,337
and none of hers.

835
00:50:12,409 --> 00:50:16,004
No one is that perfect,
that pure.

836
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,513
You know, I had something
on Mother Teresa once.

837
00:50:18,582 --> 00:50:20,174
But then she died

838
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:22,013
and it just wasn't
worth it anymore.

839
00:50:22,085 --> 00:50:25,885
I know how to flush out
this Simone woman.

840
00:50:27,424 --> 00:50:30,450
A tell-all story
from her childhood.

841
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,427
You have one?

842
00:50:34,164 --> 00:50:37,361
I will when you're
finished writing it.

843
00:50:58,455 --> 00:51:00,320
Please don't
make me do this.

844
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,483
Guard, open this door
right now.

845
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,390
Mr. Taransky gave me
specific instructions

846
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:05,758
never to open up this door.

847
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:07,319
- What are you doing?!
- Mr. Taransky!

848
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:09,490
- Why did you do this?!
- We have to talk to her!

849
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:11,397
- We know she's in there.
- Okay.

850
00:51:11,468 --> 00:51:13,459
What is this about?

851
00:51:13,537 --> 00:51:15,232
We've got the tracking numbers
for "Eternity Forever."

852
00:51:15,305 --> 00:51:16,237
they're in the toilet.

853
00:51:16,306 --> 00:51:18,137
She's gotta get out there
and sell the film.

854
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:20,301
What do you want her to do,
go door-to-door?

855
00:51:20,377 --> 00:51:23,346
even Garbo would be on the talk show
circuit if she were alive!

856
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:26,007
It is precisely because she
doesn't crave the limelight

857
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:27,380
that people love her!

858
00:51:27,451 --> 00:51:29,248
- This is bullshit!
- She is about the work,

859
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:32,117
- And only the work!
- This is overshadowing the work.

860
00:51:32,189 --> 00:51:33,850
If you can't handle her,
I will.

861
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:36,188
It's not a good time.
She's emotional.

862
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:38,193
Today, her mother dies.

863
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:40,024
Scene 4 2
of "Good for Nothing."

864
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:42,861
- This is not a good time.
- It never is.

865
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,867
- Step aside!
- We're going in!

866
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:48,200
- This is ridiculous!
- No! No!

867
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:50,535
- What are you doing?!
- Simone!

868
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:55,206
I trusted you.

869
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:00,140
- Simone?
- You can come out, it's Elaine!

870
00:52:00,217 --> 00:52:02,481
- We just want to have a meeting.
- We can talk,

871
00:52:02,552 --> 00:52:04,645
- Girl-to-girl. Just us.
- Where is she?

872
00:52:04,721 --> 00:52:06,484
- She's gone.
- Where are the sets?

873
00:52:06,556 --> 00:52:09,650
- God, that is so like her.
- Where are the cameras?

874
00:52:09,726 --> 00:52:12,251
Viktor, we're not paying
for this are we?

875
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:13,694
What is all this?

876
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:18,133
What is all this?

877
00:52:18,201 --> 00:52:20,135
Well...

878
00:52:20,203 --> 00:52:22,501
I suppose

879
00:52:22,572 --> 00:52:25,006
it was gonna come out
sooner or later.

880
00:52:25,075 --> 00:52:28,511
I guess I'm actually
relieved in a way.

881
00:52:28,578 --> 00:52:30,443
I can just say it finally.

882
00:52:32,249 --> 00:52:34,581
She's a computer...

883
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:36,676
addict.

884
00:52:36,753 --> 00:52:38,220
What?

885
00:52:38,288 --> 00:52:40,620
She's a computer addict!

886
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:42,988
She's buried in here.

887
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:44,959
Day in, day out.

888
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:49,089
Of course.
I should have guessed.

889
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:52,363
It's why she never
goes anywhere,

890
00:52:52,435 --> 00:52:55,063
- Why she's never seen in public.
- Now you're getting it.

891
00:52:55,138 --> 00:52:57,299
Probably spends
her whole life in chat rooms.

892
00:52:57,374 --> 00:52:59,604
- The one place she can be herself.
- Anonymous.

893
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:01,667
Only it's worse.
It's far worse.

894
00:53:03,713 --> 00:53:05,544
She's extremely
agoraphobic.

895
00:53:05,615 --> 00:53:08,641
She has a morbid fear
of people,

896
00:53:08,718 --> 00:53:11,414
of germs,

897
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:13,956
places, heights...

898
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,685
- Name it.
- This is terrible.

899
00:53:15,759 --> 00:53:17,488
How is she going
to plug the film?

900
00:53:17,561 --> 00:53:20,155
- Yes, indeed.
- She has to do publicity.

901
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:22,664
Maybe I could get her
to do something.

902
00:53:22,732 --> 00:53:24,927
Maybe a television
talk show or something.

903
00:53:25,001 --> 00:53:26,059
Yes!

904
00:53:26,136 --> 00:53:28,730
- Taped.
- Make it live, please.

905
00:53:28,805 --> 00:53:30,170
- Live?
- Please.

906
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,435
She'd never go there.
It would have to be remote.

907
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:34,238
We can work with that.

908
00:53:34,311 --> 00:53:36,176
I can't promise anything.

909
00:53:36,246 --> 00:53:37,941
- We understand.
- Thank you, Viktor.

910
00:53:38,014 --> 00:53:40,244
- Thank you, Viktor.
- Don't grovel.

911
00:53:40,317 --> 00:53:42,114
Thank you.

912
00:53:42,185 --> 00:53:43,413
Give her our best.

913
00:53:43,486 --> 00:53:45,351
That agoraphobia...
it's like a plague.

914
00:53:45,422 --> 00:53:46,946
It's out of control
in Europe.

915
00:53:49,025 --> 00:53:52,017
It's so good of you
to protect her like this.

916
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:55,190
She wanted you...

917
00:53:55,265 --> 00:53:57,529
No, no.
Don't touch that.

918
00:53:57,601 --> 00:53:59,762
Germs.

919
00:53:59,836 --> 00:54:01,531
She wanted you
to have that.

920
00:54:01,605 --> 00:54:04,301
She was there.
She was right there.

921
00:54:04,374 --> 00:54:06,001
Yeah.

922
00:54:08,545 --> 00:54:09,978
Oh, my gosh.

923
00:54:12,882 --> 00:54:14,474
She didn't,
by any chance,

924
00:54:14,551 --> 00:54:16,212
happen
to mention me?

925
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,285
Actually, she did.

926
00:54:19,356 --> 00:54:21,881
She, uh...

927
00:54:21,958 --> 00:54:25,951
she said that she thought
you werevery beautiful.

928
00:54:26,029 --> 00:54:28,327
- Really?
- Yeah.

929
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,191
Would you want to go

930
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:33,702
and get something to eat,
or something?

931
00:54:35,739 --> 00:54:37,673
Viktor,
I'd love to, really.,

932
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:40,676
but don't you have
to go talk to Simone?

933
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:44,740
If I can find her.

934
00:54:49,419 --> 00:54:51,512
Well.

935
00:54:51,588 --> 00:54:53,852
All right. Good.

936
00:54:53,923 --> 00:54:56,016
- Thanks, Viktor.
- Thank you.

937
00:54:59,596 --> 00:55:00,961
I'm gonna... By e.

938
00:55:21,384 --> 00:55:24,649
Tonight,
on Frank Brand Live...

939
00:55:24,721 --> 00:55:26,985
Since taking the nation
by storm

940
00:55:27,057 --> 00:55:31,084
in her debut movie,
"Sunrise, Sunset,"

941
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:35,325
no one has managed to land
a live television interview

942
00:55:35,398 --> 00:55:39,164
with this fabulous
shooting starlet, Simone...

943
00:55:39,235 --> 00:55:41,169
until now.

944
00:55:41,237 --> 00:55:44,502
she's agreed to talk
with us tonight

945
00:55:44,574 --> 00:55:46,371
from the set
of her new film.

946
00:55:46,443 --> 00:55:48,570
Welcome, Simone.

947
00:55:50,747 --> 00:55:54,774
So glad you can find time
in your hectic s chedule to be here.

948
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:56,944
It's my pleasure.

949
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,954
Wonderful to be
with you, Frank.

950
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:04,255
No one can accuse you
of being overexposed, Simone.

951
00:56:04,327 --> 00:56:07,296
Why have you stay ed so completely
out of the limelight?

952
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:09,662
I guess I just think actors
talk too much.

953
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:12,668
Does the world really want
to hear my life story

954
00:56:12,736 --> 00:56:15,170
just be cause I have a movie
opening on Friday?

955
00:56:15,238 --> 00:56:17,638
Wow.

956
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:19,937
She is all woman.

957
00:56:20,009 --> 00:56:21,271
Of course, the problem

958
00:56:21,344 --> 00:56:23,676
with shying away
from publicity these days

959
00:56:23,747 --> 00:56:26,079
is that it tends
to attract even more.

960
00:56:26,149 --> 00:56:28,481
Don't I know it.

961
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:30,451
But the only reason
I'm here now,

962
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:33,250
is to put the attention
back where it belongs,

963
00:56:33,323 --> 00:56:35,621
on Mr. Taransky's film.

964
00:56:35,692 --> 00:56:38,092
And you don't secretly want
the attention?

965
00:56:38,161 --> 00:56:40,026
I'm not even sure
I deserve it.

966
00:56:40,096 --> 00:56:41,961
You see, after tonight,

967
00:56:42,031 --> 00:56:44,329
I'll have just as much
s creen time on your show

968
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:46,130
as I have in my movies.

969
00:56:46,202 --> 00:56:48,898
Now, how is that healthy
for a performer?

970
00:56:48,972 --> 00:56:52,203
Because you have to understand,
Frank, none of this is real.

971
00:56:52,275 --> 00:56:55,301
Who I am on s creen
and who I really am,

972
00:56:55,378 --> 00:56:57,608
they're two totally
different people.

973
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,580
Change of topic.

974
00:56:59,649 --> 00:57:01,583
You have been
romantically linked

975
00:57:01,651 --> 00:57:03,949
to dozens of men
in the press...

976
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:07,285
Mick Jagger, Steven Hawking,
Fidel Castro,

977
00:57:07,357 --> 00:57:09,450
most recently,
Viktor Taransky.

978
00:57:09,526 --> 00:57:11,517
Is there a Mr. Right
in there somewhere?

979
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:15,621
You know, Frank, I'd rather not
dis cuss my priv ate life.

980
00:57:15,698 --> 00:57:17,290
But Viktor and l,

981
00:57:17,367 --> 00:57:19,301
we are inseparable.

982
00:57:19,369 --> 00:57:21,132
Oh, Viktor.

983
00:57:21,204 --> 00:57:22,967
You dog.

984
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:26,204
I wouldn't be here today
without him.

985
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:39,150
Would you like
a moment, Simone?

986
00:57:39,222 --> 00:57:41,247
No, I'm okay.

987
00:57:44,694 --> 00:57:46,525
Okay.

988
00:57:46,596 --> 00:57:48,564
Then let's talk about
this work

989
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:50,155
you care so much about.

990
00:57:50,233 --> 00:57:51,564
Sure.

991
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:53,659
Where would you like
to start, Frank?

992
00:57:53,736 --> 00:57:56,296
- How about the nudity?
- I know where that is.

993
00:57:56,372 --> 00:57:58,602
N udity's just never been
an issue for me.

994
00:57:58,675 --> 00:58:00,609
I know that tree.

995
00:58:00,677 --> 00:58:03,339
- Clothes are simply an option.
- I know that tree.

996
00:58:03,413 --> 00:58:04,641
I know where that is.

997
00:58:04,714 --> 00:58:06,682
What exactly was it
that attracted you

998
00:58:06,749 --> 00:58:08,273
to your first two projects?

999
00:58:08,351 --> 00:58:11,286
I suppose what I like most
about the movies I'm in

1000
00:58:11,354 --> 00:58:13,879
is that they're not about
special effects.

1001
00:58:13,957 --> 00:58:16,949
And they are better
for it, I might add.

1002
00:58:27,036 --> 00:58:30,130
We appear to be having
some satellite difficulties.

1003
00:58:30,206 --> 00:58:33,300
But, before we lose you
completely, Simone,

1004
00:58:33,376 --> 00:58:35,810
I just want to say
thank you.

1005
00:58:35,879 --> 00:58:37,369
Thank you, Frank.

1006
00:58:37,447 --> 00:58:39,938
Goodby e.

1007
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:43,213
Ladies and gentlemen,
Simone.

1008
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:15,942
I've been here before.

1009
00:59:16,019 --> 00:59:17,953
On my honeymoon
with my ex-wife.

1010
00:59:19,188 --> 00:59:20,621
Yeah, look.

1011
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:23,056
It's the exact
same tree.

1012
00:59:23,126 --> 00:59:25,117
And look
in the distance.

1013
00:59:27,697 --> 00:59:28,857
The mountain.

1014
00:59:32,035 --> 00:59:33,969
It's a hotel.

1015
00:59:35,939 --> 00:59:38,464
I don't understand.

1016
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:41,135
Could they have built
that hotel sincey esterday?

1017
00:59:43,379 --> 00:59:44,971
Get in the car.

1018
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:06,365
Simone! Simone!

1019
01:00:14,344 --> 01:00:16,835
We don't do the photos,
you don't get the cover.

1020
01:00:16,913 --> 01:00:18,244
It's as simple as that.

1021
01:00:18,314 --> 01:00:21,181
Yes. Written answers
to written questions.

1022
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:23,616
Didn't we have
this conversation before?

1023
01:00:25,088 --> 01:00:27,648
Yeah, web site interviews,
no problem.

1024
01:00:27,724 --> 01:00:30,420
I think people are gonna
love "Eternity Forever."

1025
01:00:30,493 --> 01:00:33,758
"Eternity Forever"
is my finest work.

1026
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:35,559
I loved working
with the director

1027
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,827
of "Eternity Forever."
he's a genius.

1028
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:39,128
You wish.

1029
01:00:43,006 --> 01:00:45,099
It's wonderful being
a movie star.

1030
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:50,306
But there's so many other ways
I want to express myself.

1031
01:00:56,953 --> 01:00:59,046
But it's not enough
to be a movie star.

1032
01:00:59,122 --> 01:01:01,022
You have to be
a pop star, too.

1033
01:01:02,592 --> 01:01:05,083
If you really want
to make a difference.

1034
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:33,013
N ice boat, Taransky!

1035
01:01:33,089 --> 01:01:34,852
It's not a boat,

1036
01:01:34,924 --> 01:01:36,619
it's a yacht.

1037
01:01:38,428 --> 01:01:40,089
I know
what you're up to.

1038
01:01:40,163 --> 01:01:42,654
You know, I really
don't have time for this.

1039
01:01:42,732 --> 01:01:45,530
I think you do,
'cause I know it's a fake.

1040
01:01:47,103 --> 01:01:48,502
It's bogus.

1041
01:01:48,571 --> 01:01:51,335
You used an old library shot
for the background.

1042
01:01:52,942 --> 01:01:54,705
She never
was in N ew Mexico.

1043
01:01:54,777 --> 01:01:56,745
She never even left
the studio.

1044
01:01:56,813 --> 01:01:58,747
I've done my homework.

1045
01:01:58,815 --> 01:02:01,306
- I've studied her.
- I bet you have.

1046
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:04,649
I've looked at every piece
of publicity she's done.

1047
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:06,416
And as far as I can tell,

1048
01:02:06,489 --> 01:02:08,081
there's no evidence

1049
01:02:08,157 --> 01:02:10,352
that she hasever left
the studio.

1050
01:02:10,426 --> 01:02:12,053
Oh...

1051
01:02:12,128 --> 01:02:14,426
And for some reason,

1052
01:02:14,497 --> 01:02:16,328
this woman leaves
no paper trail?

1053
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:19,197
Now, I've ob tained a copy
of your bank account.

1054
01:02:19,268 --> 01:02:21,498
I know you have
power of attorney,

1055
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:23,835
but so far,
you have not turned over

1056
01:02:23,906 --> 01:02:26,340
a single solitary cent
to this woman.

1057
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:28,001
I keep it in a trust.

1058
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:30,341
I know that's what you want
people to believe,

1059
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:31,846
but I gotta tell you,

1060
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:34,178
embezzlement
is a serious matter.

1061
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:36,616
Not to mention abduction.

1062
01:02:36,686 --> 01:02:38,449
- Abduction?
- Yeah.

1063
01:02:38,521 --> 01:02:40,352
Off the record.

1064
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:42,186
I want to know
how you're doing it.

1065
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:44,590
Is it drugs?
Is it mind control?

1066
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:46,924
Is it blackmail?
Is it all three?

1067
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:51,298
What do you do? Do you keep her
locked in a box somewhere?

1068
01:02:51,367 --> 01:02:53,995
What is it exactly

1069
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:55,935
that you want?

1070
01:02:56,005 --> 01:02:58,599
I want to see her.

1071
01:02:58,674 --> 01:03:02,166
U nless you show me
Simone live and in person,

1072
01:03:02,245 --> 01:03:05,009
I show these photos
to the authorities.
