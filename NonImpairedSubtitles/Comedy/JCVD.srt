1
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,348
It didn't work.

2
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,199
It didn't work.

3
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,633
In the middle there...

4
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,758
It's on amidst...

5
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,909
The window didn't
explode right...

6
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,834
and it is very difficult for me
to do everything in one shot.

7
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,434
You know, I'm 47 years old...

8
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,236
Just because he brought
John Woo to Hollywood

9
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,188
doesn't mean he can rub my dick
with sandpaper.

10
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,677
He still thinks
we're making Citizen Kane?

11
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,596
Not using a gun symbolizes
the whole purity of the character.

12
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,758
The purity...

13
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,270
This isn't about adults...

14
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,719
We're talking about a child,

15
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,074
an environment...

16
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,514
My client...

17
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,158
is aware...

18
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,637
of the responsibility
of raising a child.

19
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,594
She leads a quiet,
peaceful life.

20
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,297
On the other hand,
we have an actor here

21
00:04:55,332 --> 00:04:57,389
who's obviously disgruntled.

22
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,356
Whose known past problems
I just mentioned

23
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,715
are less than ambiguous.

24
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,996
And whose entire
career experience

25
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,750
is with films
whose values

26
00:05:08,768 --> 00:05:10,960
no responsible
aware parent

27
00:05:10,995 --> 00:05:12,709
would ever want to
expose their children to,

28
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,791
including myself, Your Honor.

29
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,719
Violence...

30
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,350
that's all on film,
Your Honor.

31
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,351
The legitimacy
of violence...

32
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,159
How this actor
play death?

33
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,833
Let me count
the ways.

34
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,999
Mangled under the wheels
a truck...

35
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,839
Strangulation...

36
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,638
Fracturing the skull...

37
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,591
Taking out
"the timber log"...

38
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,159
They were low budgets. Every one
of my movies were having heart!

39
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,639
Laceration...

40
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,195
Crushed under
the wheels of a car...

41
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,159
Death by strangulation...
Crushed ribs...

42
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,993
I make money with this!
I feed them!

43
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,272
- Please be seated, Mr.
- It's not about money!

44
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,995
- Allez, one more! Again.
- Gauging out the eye...

45
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,428
Kicks to the groin...

46
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,557
Can I go to the
restroom, please?

47
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,993
Crushed under the
wheels of a truck...

48
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,713
Gauging out the eyes...

49
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,794
Crushing the skull...

50
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,115
Shit.

51
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,433
<i>- Take off! Immediately! Take off!
- Allright!</i>

52
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,270
See the Arab in the film?

53
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,555
See that beard? Ever seen one
like that on a plane or a bus?

54
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,597
You think I look like him?

55
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,952
The movie's from 1986...

56
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,193
Haven't you ever had an idea just
to realize you've seen it before?

57
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,273
Chuck Norris giving Ben Laden
the idea of 9-11, that's bull!

58
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,795
But Chuck Norris
works for the CIA.

59
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,313
Yesterday it was Schwarzy...

60
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,075
Seen how the Arabs in "True Lies"
get all excited like hyenas?

61
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,918
Action films need bad guys.

62
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,868
Exactly! In the 70's,
it was the Viets, now the Arabs.

63
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,034
Stallone in "Rambo 3",
Hauer in "Wanted: Dead or Alive",

64
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,792
Bruce Willis in "The Siege",

65
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,030
Steven Seagal in
"Executive Decision"?

66
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,556
And what's his name,
Mark Wahlberg who fights in Irak?

67
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,029
- Van Damme!
- He never hit Arabs!

68
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,758
Dummy, Van Damme's outside!

69
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,390
Hey, Mr Van Damme! Wait!
I'm a great fan of yours!

70
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,754
- How are you?
- Fine and you?

71
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,434
- What's this? Lost in Schaerbeek?
- Going to the post office.

72
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,955
A quick snap for the store?

73
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,031
Thanks, sir!
Look, it's Van Damme!

74
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:46,996
Hello!

75
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,151
Don't hello him.
Just take the picture.

76
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,034
Yeah!

77
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,190
Your turn, now.
Jean-Claude Van Damme!

78
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,189
Good?

79
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,509
Wait, my grandma
adores you too...

80
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,908
In five minutes!

81
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,436
Thanks, sir. Wow!
It was Jean-Claude Van Damme!

82
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,910
He's cool! I pictured him taller,
but he's short.

83
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,435
He's cool! Classy and all!

84
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,349
He's all tanned.

85
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,999
He'll be right back.

86
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,674
- He cured cancer or what?
- Why? Did you?

87
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,229
- No, but nobody kisses my ass.
- He's a star!

88
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,356
He left this shithole,
for Hollywood.

89
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,953
He fought to be
where he is now.

90
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,031
You've never left town!

91
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,317
Whether you're a star or a dog,
I don't care!

92
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,392
Then why are you waiting for him?
You can't park here!

93
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,348
He's just a regular guy.
Back off, watch my car!

94
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,795
Calm down, ma'am!

95
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,794
Move back!
I don't wanna see you around here.

96
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,797
- Help me, sir.
- You can't park here.

97
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,269
- Only 10 minutes!
- She's waiting for her idol.

98
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,271
- Who's the idol?
- Jean-Claude Van Damme.

99
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,158
- Who?
- Jean-Claude Van Damme!

100
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,594
Get outta here!

101
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,313
"Aware!"

102
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,232
Look, we have pictures.

103
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,473
- How is he?
- He's nice.

104
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,074
He's just a regular guy, sir.

105
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,435
I don't think so.
The guy's a star.

106
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,160
He left this shithole
for Hollywood...

107
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,117
He fought to get
where he is now.

108
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,919
You've never even left town!

109
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,356
So what?
Bunch of ass-kissers...

110
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,876
What'd you say?

111
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,678
I was talking to them.
Help me!

112
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,231
I was talking to
them, I swear!

113
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,992
You have a flat here.
Registration!

114
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,276
- Oh, come on!
- Registration!

115
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,193
- Don't ruin my day, please!
- Registration!

116
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,911
- I always get the crap, thanks!
- Anytime!

117
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,798
You owe me big time!

118
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,232
Shut up!

119
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,636
For once, it's not my fault!

120
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,513
Please, ma'am. Shut up!

121
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,396
Stop now.

122
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,188
Don't stay here!

123
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,832
Get lost!

124
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,115
You heard me!

125
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,316
Shit...

126
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,036
Open! What's going
on in there?

127
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,390
What's going on!

128
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,396
On the ground!

129
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,159
Central to Unit 27.

130
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,319
Jean-Claude Van Damme's robbing
a post office. I need back-up.

131
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,876
Possible hostage situation.
I repeat

132
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,548
possible hostage situation.

133
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,914
1. The Answer
before the Question.

134
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,633
He's in court
for his daughter's custody.

135
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,519
and he can't approach
his ex-wife...

136
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,556
He picked up!

137
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,108
He picked up!

138
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,030
Please, move, convince...
Perfect.

139
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,830
Mr Van Damme?

140
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,633
This is Commissioner Bruges.
How are things inside?

141
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,913
It could be better.

142
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,917
OK, let me ask you first,

143
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,638
is anyone injured?

144
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,153
Hello?
Jean-Claude?

145
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,236
No, no.

146
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,032
A man's unconscious
and bleeding.

147
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,319
Jean-Claude,
may I call you Jean-Claude?

148
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,557
I'm Commissioner Christian Bruges.
Call me Christian.

149
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,397
You have to release
the wounded man.

150
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:59,038
It's not in your interest, nor mine,
to have blood on our hands.

151
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,033
Will you release him?

152
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,111
No, no one leaves.
It's impossible.

153
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,395
What if I came with
a doctor? Hello?

154
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,149
Jean-Claude?

155
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,551
What if I came with a doctor?

156
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,630
Fine, but unarmed.

157
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,872
I give you my word.

158
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,155
Commissioner Bruges?

159
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,992
Call me a doc please!

160
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:38,552
- Lieutenant Perthier, SWAT team.
- I just spoke with Van Damme.

161
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,679
So, I'm going inside and then,
we'll debrief, if necessary.

162
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,274
- I'd like to deploy my men.
- No, it's too soon.

163
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,396
Could I borrow a vest?

164
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,669
I'll give it back.

165
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,875
Jackie.

166
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,956
A doctor, please.

167
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,999
I asked for a doc!

168
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,155
Get me a doc!

169
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,753
Eric went to med school.

170
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,757
- OK, let's go.
- Boss!

171
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,837
Hello? Jean-Claude?

172
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,476
No!

173
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,356
You have my word that...

174
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,080
Jean-Claude,
we're here to find...

175
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,510
What?

176
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,592
We see the chief of police

177
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,308
exiting the video store,
crisis unit HQ,

178
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,109
and going towards the post office
in his boxer shorts.

179
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,511
Is Van Damme
trying to mock the police?

180
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,309
In any case,
it seems to be working

181
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,675
as the public
is rooting for him

182
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,554
in spite of today's events.

183
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,155
The shorts! The shorts!

184
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,512
Don't shoot, I'm a hostage!

185
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,518
Drop the kit.

186
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,993
Slide it over.

187
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,389
Check the kit.

188
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,429
Go to the back room.

189
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,878
Hurry! He's bleeding!

190
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,078
No tricks, Jean-Claude.

191
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,510
Van Damme's fame
has driven them here.

192
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,513
They're clearly fans,
here to support him,

193
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:30,719
and the slightest move
gets the crowd on fire,

194
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,279
yelling out his name.

195
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:36,672
We 've heard a few snide remarks,
like the one about the Commissioner

196
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,316
who went out in his shorts.
But the situation is dramatic.

197
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,677
Sir, don't move.

198
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,236
What am I doing here?
What's going on?

199
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,834
Calm down, sir.

200
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,316
- Don't move.
- It hurts.

201
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,678
What the fuck...

202
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,669
No, Jean-Claude!

203
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,635
Don't move!
Get outta here!

204
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,074
Calm down, Jean-Claude!

205
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,509
Get outta here!

206
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,753
The curtain!
Help them!

207
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,436
Right on!

208
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,512
Gimme five! Awesome!
How did you do that?

209
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,193
Seriously! What a pro!

210
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,110
What's this?

211
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,349
See what he did?

212
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,715
This isn't a movie!
What do I care?

213
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,553
Take him with the others!
Fast!

214
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,551
Listen, smart-ass,

215
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,871
you better think of something
or I'll shoot...

216
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,712
How do you do it Jean-Claude?

217
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,031
You got him in the balls
with your foot and your hand!

218
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,112
You're too fast for
me, I swear.

219
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,875
Sit down, you deserve it.

220
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,479
Hey!

221
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,637
Can't you see he
saved his life!

222
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,231
He saved all of us!

223
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,471
Jean-Claude!
He's still out cold.

224
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,679
What a fag.

225
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,072
Find a way to get
us outta here

226
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,794
or I'll shoot 1 per hour,
starting with our hero.

227
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,836
They're clueless.

228
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,195
We can ask anything...

229
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,712
like a ransom
with him as hostage.

230
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,391
Let's ask for a million!

231
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,551
A million?
Where did you see a million?

232
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,029
Have you even seen a million?

233
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,634
Where are you?
In a post office!

234
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,996
He's a star!
I mean, it's Van Damme!

235
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,878
They expect more than a mill.

236
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,394
We leave
with him and the cash.

237
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,910
So the hostages can go to the cops
once we're out!

238
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,872
Talkin' about a brain...

239
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,471
You almost got me killed!

240
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,199
- You realize?
- Listen...

241
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,395
I'd be dead!

242
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,874
You're not the FBI!

243
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,077
- I'm still the boss.
- Go to Hollywood for drama!

244
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:38,990
I work, here!

245
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,550
Fuck your action men in black!
They're no better than us.

246
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,199
Let's just shoot him.

247
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,557
That's not our job!
We're here to save lives!

248
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,871
- So maybe that's what it takes.
- This isn't a war!

249
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,871
You're telling me
how to do my job?

250
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,316
Can't you just shut up?

251
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,756
The gendarmes are gonna show up.
Get lost!

252
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,434
Yeah, get outta here.

253
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,480
What are you laughing at?

254
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,349
And the kid?

255
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,149
The kid...

256
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,838
we take him with us.

257
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:22,719
Know anyone that would want to have
a dead kid on their conscience?

258
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,269
Yes.

259
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,396
Boss!

260
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,151
- The blood...
- Yes, Jean-Claude?

261
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,958
It's because of your crap.

262
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:48,398
No, I have nothing to do with this.
The SWAT team decided alone...

263
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,629
I swear, I wouldn't have...

264
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,472
- I have a list of demands.
- Yes.

265
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,555
You have to do something

266
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,677
about the kid first.

267
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,472
The kid,

268
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,948
you have to release him.

269
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,599
Negative.

270
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,550
- You have enough hostages!
- Cut the crap!

271
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,671
- You want the list or not?
- Yes, I'm listening.

272
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,034
You have enough hostages!

273
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,672
I want a million euros
in small bills.

274
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,715
Unmarked,
with different serial numbers.

275
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,958
I want a bus for the airport,

276
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:21,109
a jet with a full tank. Destination
to be confirmed once I'm on board.

277
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,838
Then, I'll release
the hostages.

278
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,116
You're asking a
lot, Jean-Claude.

279
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,191
Honestly, you realize that...

280
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,319
- It won't work.
- What?

281
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,792
I'm Jean-Claude Van Damme.
It makes no sense, it's all bullshit.

282
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,712
It should be less realistic.

283
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,279
Like what?

284
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,393
Wait, I have an idea.

285
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:50,158
I'll also need
465,000 dollars...

286
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,756
Yeah.

287
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,638
...to be delivered by noon.

288
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,074
To the firm Bernstein,
Katz and Phillis...

289
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,270
He hung up.

290
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,794
What's that? A code?

291
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,154
No, it makes more sense.

292
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,196
Who are those guys?

293
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,237
- My attorneys in LA.
- Don't mess with me.

294
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,675
Dumbass.
He's in court for the custody...

295
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,831
Shut up!
You leave them all alone!

296
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,592
- Change the tone.
- Shut up.

297
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,113
- Watch it, OK?
- Go back!

298
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,350
- I'm not your baby brother!
- Go!

299
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,230
Look, Carradine,
I'll go when I'm ready.

300
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,517
Go back, your idol's coming.
Ass-kisser, get lost!

301
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,874
I'm staying.

302
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,475
Now, I'm going.

303
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,710
OK, then go!

304
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,474
He's right. A movie star
asking for a million...

305
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,029
it's ridiculous.

306
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,317
But a star asking for money
to pay for his law fees

307
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,435
sounds desperate.

308
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,151
Not bad, not bad at all.

309
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,394
Go back with the others.

310
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,278
I said, beat it!

311
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,438
Look at those idiots!

312
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,833
So: 1 + 1 = 1.
It's still you.

313
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,399
- It's love.
- 2 in 1.

314
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:11,348
But for us:
1+1 = 2 and 2+2 = 4.

315
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,876
Then we're 'selfish',
we take money without sharing it.

316
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:19,238
But if 1+1 = 1...
Or maybe 1+1 = 11.

317
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,635
That's beautiful!

318
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,711
I just got back
from Belgium today,

319
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,958
I was at my mother's and...

320
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,276
What was the name he said,
in English?

321
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,471
- Bernstein.
- What?

322
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,834
Leon Bernstein.

323
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,789
We don't think horizontal,
we think vertical.

324
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,279
We stand straight in life.

325
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,159
We don't think in hours
and in seconds, it's 'neutral'.

326
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,232
The snake, Adam and Eve,
I don't buy it anymore.

327
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,995
A snake is nice.
An apple 's good, it contains pectin.

328
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,437
It's good for cholesterol.

329
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,677
Can an apple hurt a woman?

330
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,229
Some people failed,

331
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,631
because they're not 'aware'.

332
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:04,679
They don 't acknowledge
that they exist.

333
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:08,719
Poor things, they don 't know.
So, I'm 'aware', I'm awake.

334
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,710
What's "aware"?

335
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,872
You wake up
wondering what you're doing...

336
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,393
No, it's fine.

337
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,954
Dolphins use wave-lengths too,
they're smart in the sea.

338
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,439
We live in the earth.

339
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,239
They communicate,
since they don't blah-blah-blah...

340
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,308
Gloria, would you rather live
with your mommy

341
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,112
or with your daddy?

342
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,196
I don't wanna live with Dad.

343
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,319
Why, Gloria?

344
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:49,106
Every time my dad is on a TV Show,
my friends make fun of me.

345
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,154
- But you love your daddy?
- Yes.

346
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,070
But you rather stay
with your mom.

347
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,080
I want them to stop
making fun of me.

348
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,789
Thank you, Gloria.
You may be excused.

349
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,920
I think it's November
10th or 15th.

350
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,916
There's no special
requirements,

351
00:26:38,204 --> 00:26:39,992
you don't have to
do any training,

352
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,796
You don't have to be in
any kind of good shape...

353
00:26:41,806 --> 00:26:44,381
They'll put you in
shape on the shoot.

354
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,231
- The commission?
- Ahn?

355
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,992
- What's your commission?
- Normal.

356
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,553
No, no. The one I was...

357
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,352
10%...
but I'll take 8.

358
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,870
They'll kill my career,
those guys.

359
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,114
You get good money, they send me
to Bulgaria, the fucking factory.

360
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,630
They're making the movie for what?
A Million dollars?...

361
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,119
No, no!
You're exaggerating...

362
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,998
With the 30% sales fee...

363
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,594
You're exaggerating that.
This movie is huge in Asia!

364
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,671
I know,
6 million dollars!

365
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,518
Foreign, 30%: 1.8

366
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:19,150
producing fee:
1.25 million... OK?

367
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,713
Why do you do this shit to yourself?
That's my job...

368
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,553
I get paid 4 million dollars,
how much is left for the picture?

369
00:27:23,588 --> 00:27:25,512
Come on, man! That is my job.
Let me worry about that.

370
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:29,559
I would take less money
and put me in a fucking Studio!

371
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,678
If they get me for free,
one movie only, for free, "Van Damme".

372
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,115
It's worth at least
6 in Europe!

373
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,050
They pay me scale,

374
00:27:36,051 --> 00:27:38,875
at least I would be in a big movie
and would give me the chance...

375
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,156
And you have those
contacts with the Studio!

376
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,644
What's going on here?

377
00:27:42,645 --> 00:27:45,109
Wait a minute, you're not
seeing the big picture...

378
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,236
No, the big picture,
you're selling packages!

379
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,437
Yeah, but some there's
a director involved,

380
00:27:49,438 --> 00:27:52,076
and there's a cinematographer
involved, what's the matter?

381
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,708
Jeff, how many years you've known me?
20 years?...

382
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,232
Once in your life,
put me in a Studio!

383
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,274
Are you bullshitting
me or what?

384
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:04,274
I mean, I've never done bad by you!
I've always done the right thing by you!

385
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,550
And that's no bullshit.

386
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,393
Look... You're an international
fucking movie star!

387
00:28:09,695 --> 00:28:11,813
Name me another
international movie star.

388
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:15,723
You work all the time,
you're well protected...

389
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,752
I lost my daughter.

390
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,230
You're gonna get over that.

391
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,519
Remember Shakespeare:

392
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,267
"The time and the hours
through the longest day...

393
00:28:30,302 --> 00:28:32,390
...everything passes "

394
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:36,471
You've gotta believe me
here, man, life goes on.

395
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,518
Especially in this town...

396
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,909
Stop it.

397
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,828
Stop it.

398
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,078
You want to
smoke a joint?

399
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,590
Jean-Claude, come on,
it was a joke!

400
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,927
Look, can't you take a joke?

401
00:29:00,937 --> 00:29:03,116
Don't forget: you start
shooting on November 10th.

402
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,271
I love you, baby!
Keep that mojo working!

403
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,270
...the check
you made bounced.

404
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,037
- What do you mean?
- You know exactly what I mean.

405
00:30:19,072 --> 00:30:20,229
It's impossible!

406
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,971
If I don't get the money by noon,
I have to drop the case.

407
00:30:26,101 --> 00:30:28,156
Ok, don't drop
the case.

408
00:30:28,157 --> 00:30:32,101
I promise you,
I'll get the money. Ok? Thank you.

409
00:30:32,169 --> 00:30:34,914
- You've been told...
- Yes, at noon. Ok, fine.

410
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,830
Hey, I'm a great
fan of yours!

411
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,194
- How are you?
- Fine and you?

412
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:07,272
- What's this? Lost in Schaerbeek?
- Going to the post office.

413
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,431
A quick snap for the store?

414
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,830
Thanks, sir!
Look, it's Van Damme!

415
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,116
Don't hello him.
Take the picture first.

416
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:23,876
Thanks guys.

417
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,508
Wait, my grandma
adores you too!

418
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,477
I'll be back in five minutes!

419
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,520
Name's Van Damme.
How's it going?

420
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,960
Hello.
Can I come in? I have a...

421
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,035
No, no, you can't,
we're closed.

422
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,315
- Closed?
- Yes.

423
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,118
But it's not six yet?

424
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:36,958
Please, it's very important.
I'm expecting a transfer.

425
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,680
Yes, but we can't...

426
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,909
No, seriously!

427
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,069
A computer problem.

428
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,233
Seriously? This can't be.
No, it's important, I have to...

429
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,118
Tomorrow, we'll let you in.

430
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:52,193
No, I need to go in today.
Listen, it's very important.

431
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,790
I need this money
for my family here, you understand?

432
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,518
Let me speak to the boss.

433
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,638
- Quickly, then.
- It'll take a sec. Thanks.

434
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,072
Hello, ma'am, how are you?

435
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,233
I'm here for a transfer.

436
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,709
The name's Jean-Claude
Van Varenberg.

437
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,314
Not my stage name Van Damme.

438
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,119
I'm sorry,
but we're out of cash today.

439
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,317
I told you, Mr Van Damme!

440
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,348
No, you told me
it was a computer problem.

441
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:39,433
Is it a cash or a computer problem?
You pick...

442
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,793
Listen, please give
me my money.

443
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,316
I have no money, my credit cards
don't work. Nothing works.

444
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,918
We're out of cash.

445
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,869
It's impossible.

446
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,590
This is a bank!
It's only 11, noon?

447
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:00,196
I'm broke, I have no money
and my cards don't work!

448
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,270
C'mon, sir.

449
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,590
Wait, what's your name?

450
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,111
Arthur.

451
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,874
Listen, I haven't
slept in two days,

452
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,918
jet lag, the Los
Angeles court,

453
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:14,868
the planes, a toy store,
my Mom on the phone, the cab,

454
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,077
the tip...
Wait, I have an idea.

455
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,838
I have a solution.

456
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,278
Then, collect some money.

457
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,113
I'm a good client here.
I'm pretty loaded.

458
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,273
Why don't you ask people here
for $700 or even $650?

459
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,318
And tomorrow take it
out of my bank account.

460
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,719
But, I can't!

461
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,592
- You don't give a shit, uh?
- No, I just can't!

462
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,472
I want my fucking money!

463
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,308
I'm sick of this,
I want my money!

464
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,477
It's like this
since yesterday.

465
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:54,593
I have no cash on me.
Van Damme without cash! Gimme a loan.

466
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:58,070
Hey, I haven't slept,
I got on a plane...

467
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,879
I just got back from
a 'child custody' thing.

468
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:05,795
Look, I'm exhausted, guys.
Help me out here.

469
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,111
First the cab, then the toys...
Please, help me!

470
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,158
- OK, c'mon now.
- What? Where?

471
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,115
Camera?

472
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,914
Camera?

473
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,074
Is this candid camera?

474
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,589
Sorry, guys, sorry!

475
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:28,548
Listen, I've had a bad day,
I haven't slept in two days.

476
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,029
Cut this one,
it's a 'bad take'.

477
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,228
Put him with the others!

478
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,597
Are you nuts?
It's Jean-Claude Van Damme!

479
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,390
C'mon! Get up now!

480
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,189
I said, get up!
Faster!

481
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,397
Faster! Move faster!

482
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,390
Come and sit over here.

483
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:04,274
Shit, what did he do to you!
Breathe. Breathe, Jean-Claude.

484
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,349
Wow! How do you
develop your triceps?

485
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,390
I can't.

486
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,390
Watch out!

487
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,238
Get up! Get up!

488
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,830
The curtain!

489
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,672
- What?
- The curtain!

490
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,549
Don't move! Shut up!
Lower your arms!

491
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,555
You too, shut up!
Lower your arms!

492
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,033
Gimme a hand, here.

493
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,516
Gimme a hand! Come!

494
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,315
What's going on?

495
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,109
Don't stay here! Get lost!

496
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,269
Open up!

497
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,709
What's going on?

498
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:20,956
Open up!

499
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,714
Look down.

500
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,154
You too, look down.

501
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,198
What are you looking at?

502
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,793
Look over there!

503
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,036
Open up!

504
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,715
What are you doing?

505
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,631
- Are you crazy?
- He was coming in.

506
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,792
How are we gonna get out now?
He's gonna call back-up!

507
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,951
Maybe, but I'm not
turning myself in!

508
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:35,351
I'm not in Belgium to be jailbait!
Watch it!

509
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,039
Don't do that again!

510
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,919
I just wanted to see
how he was doing.

511
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,793
- Shit, I almost shot him!
- OK, sit down!

512
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,718
Robbing a bank in Belgium
can't be that hard!

513
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,235
Shit! What are we
gonna do now?

514
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,274
Leave now, while
you still can.

515
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,839
- He's right!
- Shut up!

516
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,794
Turn yourselves in.

517
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:07,555
In any case, we all saw
the gunshot was an accident.

518
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,678
If I want some stretching tips,
I'll call you.

519
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,636
Well done!

520
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,555
You can insult me all you want
or even hit a hostage,

521
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,312
but I'm not
turning myself in!

522
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,598
We gotta block the exits.

523
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,840
You keep an eye on them
and cut the crap!

524
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,514
You're saying that
a man broke in...

525
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:30,157
and then you say
he got in with a key!

526
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,914
We gotta be clear
on this one,

527
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,078
otherwise,
it'll be a false statement.

528
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,439
If you say he was drunk,

529
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:42,673
I won't know for sure
until the alcohol test has been done.

530
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,712
It's as simple as that.

531
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,990
Boss, guess who's robbing
the post office!

532
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:47,910
Who?

533
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,957
I liked how you pressured
the hostages earlier.

534
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,553
It wasn't for them.

535
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,270
You heard Karate Kid.
If we cooperate...

536
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,839
Listen up, brainiac.

537
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,991
Who said it was a
perfect plan,

538
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,515
that post offices
are like the Red Cross,

539
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,318
and that we'd catch
the 12:43 train?

540
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,310
But, the moron...

541
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,948
The moron's your pal,
not mine.

542
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,315
So, if you wanna be
the boss...

543
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,712
If you wanna be the boss
and keep giving orders,

544
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:32,037
you'd better start growin' some balls
otherwise, I'm taking over.

545
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,794
And I don't mind
getting my hands dirty.

546
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,719
Commissioner! Please!

547
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,836
Hey, it's
Commissioner Bruges!

548
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,877
Is Van Damme the perp?

549
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,519
Wait. No declaration yet.

550
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,999
Has anyone been shot?

551
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,309
How many hostages
are held inside?

552
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,271
- Enough.
- What's your plan?

553
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,396
No, please!
Get him outta here!

554
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,119
Be careful with the seats.

555
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:18,074
Careful! You know how much
I can sell it for on eBay?

556
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,557
No, nothing's moving.

557
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,112
Can he turn that off?

558
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,035
- The whining thing?
- The nerves.

559
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,633
- Is that him?
- Yes.

560
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,672
Did he dye his hair?

561
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,719
He's in shock.

562
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,870
- What?
- He's still in shock.

563
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,589
Once in the film
"Hard Target",

564
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,910
I took a shot from a blank.

565
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,435
It took salts to
reanimate me.

566
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,274
"Hard Target"! John Woo!

567
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,351
- What an ass!
- Don't say that!

568
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,670
C'mon, Jean-Claude,
wait a sec!

569
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,831
He's the one who brought him
to the US.

570
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,913
Without him, he'd still be
filming pigeons in Hong Kong!

571
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,589
And then what?
He drops you!

572
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,670
At least, he did "Face Off".

573
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,149
So what?
He could have picked you!

574
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:35,351
On the other hand, when you see
"Windtalkers", there's a justice...

575
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,833
Got any new projects?

576
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,633
Not for now.

577
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,712
I saw a thing on the web,
what's it called?

578
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,676
Purple.
"Purple Amulet".

579
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,309
What about it?

580
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,790
- Steven Seagal got the part.
- What?

581
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,188
He got the part.

582
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,236
Steven Seagal?

583
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,038
You're ten times better!

584
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,750
Well, he cut off his couette.

585
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,194
His what?

586
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,509
His couette.

587
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,353
His ponytail!

588
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,194
For the first time!

589
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,915
Oh, I see...
That's a tough one...

590
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,914
Hey you! What's that?
What are you doing?

591
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,628
- Me?
- Yeah, you!

592
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,199
- Hey!
- He coughed.

593
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,679
No. You're disturbing us!

594
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,114
I think he just coughed.

595
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,317
- He coughed!
- Think I'm funny?

596
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,436
- No.
- You think I'm funny!

597
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,953
No.

598
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:30,429
- Oh, is he funny?
- No.

599
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,353
So, I see.
It's the 'aware' thing, is that it?

600
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,392
- Who are you?
- Drop it.

601
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:38,313
No, wait!
Who do you think you are?

602
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,597
You're 40
and still wearing sweatshirts?

603
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:42,510
Yeah.

604
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,113
Who do you think you are?

605
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,155
No, no, no! Shut up, OK?

606
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,631
He's tired, you know.
Drop it.

607
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:50,789
- Tired?
- Yeah.

608
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,554
I'm not tired, are you?
No, you're not.

609
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,911
So, shut up!

610
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:00,474
Get up.
Yeah get up, now!

611
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,070
- Got a smoke?
- I don't smoke.

612
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,033
Does anyone have a smoke?

613
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,755
- So?
- It's ringing, but no answer.

614
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,753
- No one?
- Nope.

615
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:39,839
Forget it, then.

616
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:43,749
Go get me a screamo-phone,
like they use in movies.

617
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,912
To shout at the public.

618
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:48,116
The day had started out fine!

619
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:51,989
But now, I'm exhausted, I'm fed up.
I got scared!

620
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,318
- Sir, let's stop...
- Do I know you?

621
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,435
I'm Commissioner Bruges.

622
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:58,194
Sir, I'm freaking out!

623
00:44:58,440 --> 00:44:59,998
There's been a hold-up

624
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,878
across the street...

625
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,473
But look at my cab!

626
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:07,748
That's what I'm saying,
let's proceed 'step by step'.

627
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:08,989
Look at my cab!

628
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,115
A few questions, first.

629
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,914
I picked him up at
the airport.

630
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:16,074
Did he have any
luggage, ma'am?

631
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,110
Man, I can't.

632
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,430
Please! Only once!

633
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:21,830
I don't want to.

634
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,355
Open your mouth.

635
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,991
Be cool, just once!

636
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,434
I'm exhausted.

637
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,353
Do me a favor!
I might never see you again.

638
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:36,149
Show me the move,
just once, please! Go ahead!

639
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,352
Please, Jean-Claude!

640
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,354
Let's all applaud!

641
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,194
Nice, Jean-Claude!

642
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,673
Told you he was the best!
Where are you going?

643
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,075
Who told you to move?
Get back there.

644
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:08,195
Faster!

645
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,513
Where's my ciggy?

646
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,075
Open your mouth!

647
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,399
Move back a bit.

648
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:33,955
A bit lower.

649
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:39,669
- Jean-Claude?
- Yeah?

650
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,398
- It's been years...
- So, don't do it.

651
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:43,390
Just once!

652
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:56,596
He shows up and says "Go!".
So off I went with him.

653
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:57,556
He said that?

654
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,392
Yes, sir.

655
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:02,120
I did what he told me to,
he's a big star!

656
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,352
- What's this?
- I just fell!

657
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,794
And what are you doing?

658
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,549
Come here now!

659
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,311
- He needs a doc.
- Are you a nurse?

660
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,473
Mr Van Damme!

661
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,155
This is...

662
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:23,158
Commissioner Bruges,
pick up the phone

663
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,594
so we can talk.

664
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:26,275
Is this a joke?

665
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,393
No, Jean-Claude.

666
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,911
They saw you with
the cabinet.

667
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:34,238
- Moving a cabinet is robbing a bank?
- Shut up!

668
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,676
If you need anything,
pick up the phone.

669
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:41,276
I'm your contact.

670
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:43,594
Bruges.

671
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,432
Here's our ticket out!

672
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:51,393
I have enough problems...

673
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:53,118
I said, shut up!

674
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:57,316
Go ahead, big shot!

675
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,991
Are we having fun, here?

676
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:12,950
Can't believe it!

677
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,232
- You read English?
- Yes.

678
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:39,317
If you tell them,
you'll have blood on your hands.

679
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:43,196
- What do I say?
- Let them talk.

680
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:46,035
What's "custody"?

681
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,997
He picked up!

682
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:53,630
Mr Van Damme.

683
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,391
Bruges. How's it
going inside?

684
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,559
It could be better.

685
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:07,513
OK, let me ask you first,
is anyone injured?

686
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:14,399
A man's unconscious
and bleeding.

687
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,716
OK, good.
May I call you Jean-Claude?

688
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:19,954
I'm Commissioner Bruges.

689
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,233
You can call me Christian.

690
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,755
You must release
the wounded man.

691
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:29,236
Neither one of us
wants to have blood on our hands.

692
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,270
Of course.

693
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,192
Will you release him?

694
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:37,279
No, no one leaves.
It's impossible.

695
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,158
What if I came with a doctor?

696
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:53,669
Hey, if there's a murder,
it's no longer a robbery.

697
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,669
- And if I come with a doc?
- Alright, but unarmed.

698
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,668
I give you my word.

699
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:03,676
Bruges...

700
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:09,199
- Whoever walks in is dead.
- If a man dies, we're screwed.

701
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:10,236
Heard me earlier?

702
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:13,951
Well, they could come naked.

703
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,390
In hostage movies, the bad guys
ask the good guys to come in

704
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:20,755
naked, so they know
they're clean.

705
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:22,953
How about naked?

706
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,109
Fine, tell them.

707
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:55,390
Where's Petrucciani?

708
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:59,279
3. Stone falls on Egg,

709
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,079
Egg breaks.

710
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,553
Sorry, man!
Didn't recognize you!

711
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:32,555
Speak.

712
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:33,829
Hey, Jeff, how are you?

713
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:35,839
Hey, dog!
What's up, dog?

714
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,716
Good, good, good...
Not so good.

715
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,199
I need some money.

716
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:41,908
Listen,
can I advance, er...

717
00:51:41,909 --> 00:51:43,989
Can the producers
advance me some money?

718
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:47,311
Listening Jean-Claude,
I was gonna call you...

719
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:48,999
...right after your
vacation was over.

720
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:51,196
They took
someone else.

721
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,395
Who?

722
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:53,835
Steven...

723
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,479
Steven?

724
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:58,548
He promised to cut
his ponytail.

725
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,475
It hurts,

726
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:01,715
i know.

727
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,873
Ok, ok, can you... Can I borrow
some money from you?

728
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:08,557
Hello!
Crank it up...

729
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:13,150
Hey, man! You're breaking
up here, I'm losing you.

730
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,757
You must be in a
tunnel or something!

731
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,034
Cut the bullshit!
Come on the phone!

732
00:52:19,258 --> 00:52:20,690
All right.
Yeah, yeah.

733
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:22,355
What's next?

734
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:25,512
No Limit Injury.
It's about a Viet vet...

735
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,033
We've done this
movie 6 months ago.

736
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:28,595
We did?

737
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:29,636
What's next?

738
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:33,913
No Limit Injury 2!
It's about a Gulf War vet.

739
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:37,311
who fights to pay
for his son education.

740
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:40,910
- Is it good?
- I don't know.

741
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,911
- Did you read it?
- I don't know.

742
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:54,356
Call the producers... and...
tell them I need some upfront.

743
00:52:54,804 --> 00:52:57,939
- Hey, man, I can't do that!
- Just fucking do it, Jeff!

744
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,877
Aren't you Van Damme?

745
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:08,513
You're Jean-Claude Van Damme,
my idol!

746
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:09,590
Listen...

747
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,676
I'm really tired and I...

748
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:17,032
Don't start acting
like a big shot,

749
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,996
Mr Hero of the century!

750
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:24,233
I can finally talk to you
and listen to that tone!

751
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,756
Let me talk to you.
You can rest, but let me talk.

752
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:30,514
Close your eyes,
but let me talk to you.

753
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:33,956
Anyway, when I see
you on screen,

754
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:36,759
well, you're really
different!

755
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:37,591
Really?

756
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,399
I think you look much better
on screen.

757
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,835
And you're much nicer too,

758
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,797
I can tell you that...

759
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,349
- No, it's just that...
- Even if you're tired.

760
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,516
I like you better on screen.

761
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:53,194
- You hurt my feelings.
- Oh, c'mon...

762
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:56,636
I always thought
you'd be nicer.

763
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:00,839
Everyone worships you
here in Belgium, you're our star!

764
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,389
You represent us
in Hollywood.

765
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,989
Get used to having a driver
who talks!

766
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:06,751
OK.

767
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:08,194
- Please!
- Sorry.

768
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:10,191
Yes, sorry! Yes!

769
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:11,629
What's that?

770
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,990
You don't need to show off!

771
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:19,116
- You're doing it on purpose or what?
- No, I'm not.

772
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:22,389
But you're nice.

773
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,070
You too, but even
more on screen!

774
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:26,429
It's hot in here!

775
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,352
- Should I open?
- No, I'm tired.

776
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,795
Then sleep, but let me talk.

777
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,871
All cab drivers in
Brussels talk!

778
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:36,830
You better get used to it
if you come here often.

779
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:40,033
No, seriously!

780
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:43,479
Star, star, star.
What are we talking about?

781
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:47,632
I surely didn't expect
this kind of attitude!

782
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:51,076
Ma'am, I didn't mean to...
Sorry.

783
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:55,358
Well you hurt me anyway,
you don't realize, you're my idol!

784
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:56,191
I'm sorry.

785
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,590
I saw all your films.

786
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:02,070
How can you be so rude?

787
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,196
I'm sorry, I'm tired...

788
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:07,958
- I still want a picture with you!
- I promise.

789
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:09,439
- Promise?
- Yes, ma'am.

790
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,397
- And you'll sign it?
- Yes, ma'am.

791
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:13,152
- It's for my son!
- Yes, ma'am.

792
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,798
Jean-Claude!

793
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:44,309
It's been over an hour and a half now
since Van Damme

794
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:47,438
has taken refuge in the Schaerbeek
downtown post office.

795
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,238
She looks better on TV.

796
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,915
We can't really say
what happened.

797
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:57,833
After using a gun
several times,

798
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,592
an anonymous source says...

799
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,955
So tell the source
to stay anonymous!

800
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:06,393
If anyone blabs,
you'll hear from me!

801
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,314
Yes, chief.

802
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,355
Thank you, chief.
Call him back.

803
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:18,472
No, he was here
and there were three people there.

804
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:22,436
OK, the Prefect authorized
the transfer. It's an order.

805
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:23,669
And the ransom?

806
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,230
- That'll have to calm him down.
- I've seen worse.

807
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,472
There's no attack.
With a kid inside, I'm not budging.

808
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:33,754
He picked up!

809
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:38,311
Good news!

810
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:41,314
- The transfer's authorized.
- Did it go through?

811
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:42,390
It will

812
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:45,592
if you cooperate...
Sorry, but it's a 2-way street.

813
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:48,430
And the money?

814
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:51,394
Same thing, it'll
take a bit longer.

815
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:54,353
You're gonna have
to cooperate.

816
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:55,675
It's...

817
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:56,955
What do you want?

818
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:58,872
The kid. Let him go.

819
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:04,954
I'll call you back.

820
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:10,678
The crowd's agitated.
Something's going on over there.

821
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:11,750
What's the commotion?

822
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:15,037
Let's go.
Despite all this confusion,

823
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:16,872
a car is trying to
get through.

824
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:19,916
- Who is it?
- What?

825
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:21,399
- Who is it?
- The Van Varenbergs.

826
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:23,073
- Who?
- Van Damme's parents.

827
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:24,673
Why don't you escort them?

828
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,198
Please! Please!

829
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:33,952
Mrs Van Damme!
Your son...

830
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,832
My son's a good man!

831
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:37,955
No comment!

832
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:41,630
What do you think you're doing?
Trying to screw me?

833
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:44,678
- You're nuts or what?
- Say you wanna screw me.

834
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:46,751
- I'm not saying that.
- The kid stays.

835
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:49,913
- They gave in.
- Shut up. It's our only vest.

836
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,433
He's right. They gave in.

837
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,556
Hey, who's doing the hold-up?

838
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:56,075
They gave in to him.
No hostage is leaving.

839
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,071
Get back, I told you!

840
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:00,196
For the second
time, don't move!

841
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:01,475
- Watch your tone.
- I do as I please.

842
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:03,596
- Get on back!
- Shut up, you heard me.

843
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:05,959
- Lower your gun.
- Calm down!

844
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:07,678
You lower yours first.

845
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:10,115
- Go on back.
- Shut up and lower your gun.

846
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:11,879
- Go on back.
- I'm going now.

847
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:13,871
They'll break negotiations.

848
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,677
And I'll break your neck.

849
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,954
If it's not the kid,
let a hostage go.

850
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:24,076
Just don't shoot, man.

851
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:26,429
Don't shoot.

852
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:28,549
Stop it.

853
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:30,069
He's right.

854
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,037
If we let one go,
he's gonna talk.

855
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,631
Not the one I'm thinking of.

856
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:18,593
Tell them we'll release one.

857
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:21,274
- Your maniac son hurt someone.
- Maniac?

858
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:24,959
He's Jean-Claude.

859
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:26,758
He's Camille.

860
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:28,433
He's Franois.

861
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:30,910
He's Van Damme or
Van Varenberg!

862
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:33,312
But he's not a maniac!

863
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:38,876
Get outta here.

864
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:44,079
He's on the line, boss.

865
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:48,554
Gotta do something
for the kid.

866
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:53,755
Help me convince your son
to let him go.

867
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:03,915
OK for a hostage,
but not the kid.

868
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:07,919
Someone wants to talk to you.

869
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:15,115
Honey?

870
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:17,749
Mom?

871
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:22,834
What are you doing, son?

872
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:24,994
Nothing.

873
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:26,476
Nothing!

874
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,876
Please talk to me, dear.

875
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:31,230
Nothing, mom.

876
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:33,956
Mom, give me the...

877
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:35,388
son of a bitch!

878
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:38,638
Get my lawyer on the phone.

879
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,955
Tell them I'm releasing a hostage.
Don't cry, Mom.

880
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:48,594
Hurry up!

881
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:54,434
Take them away.

882
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,035
It was my mother.

883
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:07,957
I don't give a shit
about your mother.

884
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:11,271
Wanna hear about mine?

885
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:13,790
- Last time I saw her...
- What?

886
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:15,634
...was when I was born.

887
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:20,669
He tries to screw me,
then he makes me cry.

888
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,230
You come with me.

889
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:26,235
- Why?
- 'Cause you're getting out.

890
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:28,916
So, let's go.

891
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:30,798
No, he stays here.

892
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:31,756
C'mon, mister.

893
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:34,872
Make the transfer
and get me his lawyer.

894
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:40,312
Rule number 1.

895
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:43,150
It's the maniac
that shows good faith.

896
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:46,108
C'mon.

897
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,029
C'mon.

898
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:57,593
- Why do I have to go?
- Shut up. Come with me.

899
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:59,512
Why do you want to keep him?

900
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:02,951
- He stays here. You come with me.
- Let him go.

901
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:04,914
Not without me.

902
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:07,959
Not without my son!

903
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:21,670
Hello?

904
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:24,070
Wait.
The lawyer's on the line.

905
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:29,798
Hi, Sir.

906
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:31,917
Mister...

907
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,035
One moment...

908
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:36,229
Mr. Bernstein,

909
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:39,920
We need you to talk the voice
of reason to your client.

910
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:40,990
Get him on the phone!

911
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:42,479
Stand up, up you go!

912
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:45,554
Let me go!

913
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:49,916
- You sure are lucky.
- So are you.

914
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:52,196
- With your gun.
- You too sure are lucky.

915
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:54,712
You're really lucky.

916
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,070
Let me go!

917
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,833
Damien, I'll be back.
Mommy's coming back!

918
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:14,349
Move.

919
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:22,678
Move. Get up.

920
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:25,871
When I say get up,
you get up!

921
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:27,355
One word
and you're dead.

922
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:29,155
Hello?

923
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:31,510
Jean-Claude, What the hell
is wrong with you?

924
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:33,154
You've got money?

925
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:34,912
Yes, of course, but...
What the f...

926
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:37,714
So then, do your job!

927
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:44,074
If you open your mouth,
you're gonna find your kid in pieces.

928
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:46,548
I'll take care of him.

929
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:51,989
What? You can't even take care
of your own kid!

930
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:53,388
It's all your fault!

931
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:54,919
They're raising the curtain!

932
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:31,753
Stand back.

933
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:35,952
Please, ma'am.
I said stand back.

934
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:54,994
Over there.

935
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:58,597
Over there, I said.

936
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:04,192
OK, so we put it
all in boxes.

937
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:06,874
I'm gonna keep
a Christmas decoration.

938
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:08,155
I like this one.

939
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:09,799
It's a little beauty.

940
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:14,317
This way, we 'II remember
it's almost Mardi Gras.

941
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:18,473
Our minds crossed.
I took a heart from my tree.

942
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:23,396
Yeah, and St. Valentine 's Day
is coming up. Hurray for love.

943
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:24,510
Dimitri's so romantic!

944
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:27,274
It's our 1,500th show today!

945
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:37,678
This movie is for me.

946
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:41,557
There we are, you and me.

947
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:51,231
Why did you do that?

948
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:54,188
Or why did I do that?

949
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:57,032
You made my dream come true.

950
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:58,952
I asked you for it.

951
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:02,994
I promised you something in return
and I haven't delivered yet.

952
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:07,998
You win, I lose.

953
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:11,958
Unless...

954
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:15,757
the path you've set for me

955
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:17,239
is full of hurdles

956
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:21,473
where the answer
comes before the question.

957
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:23,790
Yeah, I do that.

958
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:27,155
Now I know why.

959
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:31,108
It's the cure,
from what I've seen here.

960
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:33,596
It all makes sense.

961
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:37,271
It makes sense
to those who understand.

962
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:41,477
So... America,

963
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,437
poverty,

964
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:47,349
stealing to eat...

965
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:52,072
Stalking producers,
actors, 'movie stars',

966
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:55,717
going to clubs
hoping to see a star,

967
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:58,952
with my pictures,
karate magazines.

968
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:01,953
It's all I had.
I didn't speak English.

969
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:06,794
But I did 20 years of karate.

970
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:09,315
'Cause before I wasn't like that.

971
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:11,996
This... This is me today.

972
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:15,550
I used to be small
and scrawny.

973
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:18,951
And I took up karate.
Hence the Dojo, hence respect,

974
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:22,396
thou shall believe
people who say,

975
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:24,155
"Oss!"

976
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:26,719
It's Samurai code.

977
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:28,918
It's honor, no lies.

978
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:31,150
So this guy in the US,

979
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:33,272
it's not the same thing.

980
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:35,716
No one says "Oss" to you.

981
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:39,429
Sometimes people
in show business say,

982
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:46,237
I believed in
people, in the Dojo.

983
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:50,439
I was blessed
and had a lot of 'wives'.

984
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:52,836
I always believed in love.

985
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:56,908
It's hard for a woman
with three kids to say,

986
01:07:57,080 --> 01:07:59,036
"Which one do I love more?"

987
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,792
A mother...

988
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:04,710
If you have 5, 6, 7
or 10 wives in a lifetime,

989
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:07,874
they've all got
something special,

990
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:09,837
but no one cares about that

991
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,151
in the so-called media.

992
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:16,993
What about drugs?

993
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:20,473
When you got it all,
you travel the world.

994
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:22,758
When you've been in
all the hotels,

995
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:27,471
you're the prima donna
of the penthouse.

996
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:31,435
And in all hotels the world over,
traveling,

997
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:34,990
you want something more.

998
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:37,071
And because of a woman...

999
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:39,435
Well, because of love,

1000
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:42,637
I tried something
and I got hooked.

1001
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:47,071
Van Damme, the beast,

1002
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:49,072
the tiger in a cage,

1003
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:52,630
the "Bloodsport"
man got hooked.

1004
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:56,714
I was wasted mentally
and physically.

1005
01:08:57,280 --> 01:09:00,670
To the point that
I got out of it.

1006
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:06,478
I got out of it.

1007
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:08,829
But...

1008
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:11,437
It's all there.

1009
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:14,712
It's all there.

1010
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:18,671
It was really tough.

1011
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:23,838
I saw people worse
off than me.

1012
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:28,198
I went from poor to rich and thought,
why aren't we all like me.

1013
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:30,358
Why all the privileges?

1014
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:32,351
I'm just a regular guy.

1015
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:34,795
It makes me sick to
see people...

1016
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:37,791
who don't have what I've got.

1017
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:39,791
Knowing that

1018
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:43,236
they have qualities, too.

1019
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:46,198
Much more than I do!

1020
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:49,033
It's not my fault
if I was cut out to be a star.

1021
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:50,952
I asked for it.

1022
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:52,997
I asked for it,
really believed in it.

1023
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:55,754
When you're 13,
you believe in your dream.

1024
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:57,478
Well, it came true for me.

1025
01:09:57,640 --> 01:09:59,995
But I still ask myself today

1026
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:02,910
what I've done on this earth.

1027
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:04,908
Nothing!

1028
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:06,999
I've done nothing!

1029
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:12,911
And I might just die
in this post office,

1030
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:18,356
hoping to start all over
here in Belgium,

1031
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:21,593
in my country,
where my roots are.

1032
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:25,989
Start all over with my parents
and get my health back,

1033
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:29,834
pick up again.
So I really hope...

1034
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:34,553
nobody's gonna pull a trigger
in this post office...

1035
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:39,235
It's so stupid to kill people.
They're so beautiful!

1036
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:43,352
So, today, I pray to God.

1037
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:46,918
I truly believe

1038
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:49,398
it's not a movie.

1039
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:51,432
It's real life.

1040
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:55,113
Real life.

1041
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:01,871
I've seen so many things.

1042
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:05,272
I was born in Belgium,

1043
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:07,909
but I'm citizen of the world.

1044
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:10,071
I've travelled a lot.

1045
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:13,598
It's hard for me to
judge people

1046
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:16,310
and it's hard for them...

1047
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:21,190
not to judge me.

1048
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:23,631
Easier to blame me.

1049
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:28,034
Yeah, something like that.

1050
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:40,875
Dimitri's so romantic!

1051
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:43,031
It's our 1,500th show today!

1052
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:45,794
And I'm giving out rare items

1053
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:49,191
like the red wig
"Vronique et Sbastien " never wore.

1054
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:50,554
We don't know why!

1055
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:53,996
It's the hat full of ideas
for reportages.

1056
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:57,676
Say, Arthur?

1057
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:01,270
- That's your name, right?
- Yeah.

1058
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:06,316
We've gotta free
the hostages.

1059
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:09,038
I can't do that, Jean-Claude.

1060
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:11,714
Yes, you can. It's easy.

1061
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:14,439
We just go there,

1062
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:16,591
raise the curtain

1063
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:18,388
and split!

1064
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:22,835
4. Egg falls on Stone,

1065
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,036
Egg breaks.

1066
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:27,395
7 hostages left!
How are we gonna hold out?

1067
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:30,916
- It's OK. We need time.
- Wait for what? What's the plan?

1068
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:32,957
The cops question her,
then what?

1069
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:35,190
- They count the dough.
- After that...

1070
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:37,316
Hey, what dough?

1071
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:40,193
You're waiting for them
to count the million?

1072
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:43,750
You crazy? What's a million?
I won't calm down.

1073
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:46,593
How are you gonna get out?
She'll blab.

1074
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:47,909
No, we've got the kid.

1075
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:50,389
I tell you,
the first one to leave dies.

1076
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:51,754
You can't kill anyone.

1077
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:54,070
I'll kill whoever I like.
No more talking!

1078
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:57,312
The next one out is dead.
A hostage, whatever!

1079
01:12:57,480 --> 01:12:59,550
Whoever you want, you got it?

1080
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:02,792
We'll obtain more that way
and have the upper hand.

1081
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:05,190
What are you doing?

1082
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:08,390
What?
You want to hold it for me?

1083
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:10,393
Let's wait for the bus...

1084
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:13,279
What the bus?
We're gonna go home by bus?

1085
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:16,398
Why not on the subway!

1086
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:20,679
Hey, it's the
second round or what?

1087
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:22,675
I'm pissing.

1088
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:24,068
- Pissing?
- Yeah!

1089
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:25,915
You piss silently?

1090
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:27,229
Yeah, don't you?

1091
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:28,753
- You piss white?
- Yeah!

1092
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:31,434
You piss invisible!
Think I'm an idiot?

1093
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:33,033
Why? Are you sick?

1094
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:35,550
Do you piss yellow? Red?

1095
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:37,517
At least, there's color.

1096
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:39,113
- You're sick.
- So, I'm sick?

1097
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:40,599
- I'm sick?
- Yeah.

1098
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:45,955
Wait, I'm going
back to my spot...

1099
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:50,031
Where the fuck are they?

1100
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:03,998
Back in the room, faster!

1101
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:15,918
Let her through, she's the mother!
It's her son!

1102
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:28,071
Move back.

1103
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:33,673
What do you want?

1104
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:36,274
You wanna screw me
over again?

1105
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:38,272
I was just trying to help...

1106
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:39,908
Move back!

1107
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:42,997
I said, move back!

1108
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:46,038
- Don't shoot.
- Move back, move back.

1109
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:47,872
Don't fucking shoot!

1110
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:53,633
- What are you doing?
- You're gonna shoot me?

1111
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:55,677
What I'm doing?
What about you?

1112
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,991
Whose side are you on?

1113
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:59,718
- Who are you with?
- Shut up!

1114
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:03,716
Let him go!

1115
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:13,597
We want information!

1116
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:15,916
I said, get the
fuck outta here!

1117
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:17,753
You, motherfucker!

1118
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:18,591
Let go.

1119
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:24,235
Sir!

1120
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:26,789
My son, Jean-Claude...

1121
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:29,952
- What's going on?
- Is Jean-Claude dead or...

1122
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:33,559
Answer me, damn it!
He's my son!

1123
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:36,314
Make her stop crying!

1124
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:39,196
I said, let go!

1125
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:49,113
What?

1126
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:51,078
Go ahead, shoot!

1127
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,070
You too, get lost!

1128
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:00,470
<i>Back to our correspondent
in Los Angeles</i>

1129
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:05,270
<i>where it seems Van Damme's
attorney has a statement to make.</i>

1130
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:09,389
<i>We represented Mr. Van Damme
for over fifteen years,</i>

1131
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:13,075
<i>which is a lot of time, a lot of
business, a lot of friendship, so...</i>

1132
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:15,156
<i>It is with the
greatest regret that</i>

1133
01:16:15,157 --> 01:16:17,711
<i>I had to prepare the
statement with my colleagues</i>

1134
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,719
"Because of Mr. Van Damme's behavior
and for ethical purposes,

1135
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:22,552
my firm and myself hereby,

1136
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:25,513
immediately cease to represent
Jean Claude Van Damme."

1137
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:27,153
Go, over there!

1138
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,149
Bang!

1139
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:30,116
Like in movies.

1140
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:44,911
What the hell are you doing?

1141
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:49,070
Whose side are you on, you dork?
That moron soften you up?

1142
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:51,916
Oh yeah, I'm the dork?

1143
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:55,595
Yeah, a 32-year-old
who still watches karate films?

1144
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:58,149
And who gets softened up
like a beginner!

1145
01:16:58,400 --> 01:16:59,196
- A beginner?
- Yeah!

1146
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:03,717
Robbing a post office at my age,
that's a youth mistake! But at 52...

1147
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:06,075
Yeah, right! 52 years old!

1148
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:09,073
You owe me some respect.
I could be your father!

1149
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:11,151
My father?
Because of your age?

1150
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:14,039
No, because I fucked
your mother!

1151
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:17,317
Sure!

1152
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:31,752
Are you happy now?

1153
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:33,558
Did you ever go to school?

1154
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:36,712
You'd know that
stone falls on egg,

1155
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:38,872
breaks egg

1156
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:42,314
and egg which...

1157
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:45,911
an egg which falls...

1158
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:55,991
Because we can't...

1159
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:58,994
You can't save...

1160
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:01,113
the world.

1161
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:13,919
What?

1162
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:17,031
We said, "Not the mothers!"

1163
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:26,311
I don't wanna die.

1164
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:28,476
I don't wanna die.

1165
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:32,993
I don't wanna die.

1166
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:46,471
It's over, it's over.

1167
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:54,957
Don't worry, Jean-Claude.

1168
01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:58,913
Aren't we better
off without him?

1169
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:16,271
- He shot him in the head.
- Put Jean-Claude on.

1170
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:37,353
Jean-Claude?

1171
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:39,918
I wanted to ask you...

1172
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:45,678
Could you sign me
an autograph?

1173
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:50,119
For Arthur.

1174
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:53,593
Promise?

1175
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:57,229
Thanks.

1176
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:19,233
The cops.

1177
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:21,075
- No!
- Yes...

1178
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:27,388
Arthur?

1179
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:29,829
Don't shoot!

1180
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:31,989
Police!

1181
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:44,993
Police! Don't move!

1182
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:24,036
I'm a hostage!

1183
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:28,870
I'm a hostage!

1184
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:36,672
I need a doctor, now!

1185
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:38,717
- Drop the gun!
- Get lost!

1186
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:44,196
Get out or I'll smoke him!

1187
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:46,875
- Drop the gun!
- Let him go.

1188
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:55,234
Get outta here or
I'll smoke him!

1189
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:58,359
It's not him!

1190
01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:04,993
It's not Jean-Claude!

1191
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:16,595
- Get outta here!
- Drop the gun!

1192
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:19,553
I'm gonna smoke him!
Get outta here!

1193
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:55,193
I didn't do anything!

1194
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:09,835
What the hell is
going on here?

1195
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:12,999
You're a criminal!

1196
01:24:13,160 --> 01:24:16,277
Extortion of 465,000 dollars
from the Belgian State.

1197
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:18,954
- Extortion?
- What extortion?

1198
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:20,553
There's no extortion!

1199
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:22,997
You're an asshole.

1200
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:20,360
A few months later

1201
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:26,190
During the trial,
Van Damme seemed quite serene

1202
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:29,989
and wishes to remain silent...
Here he comes.

1203
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:32,358
Mr Van Damme, a statement?

1204
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:34,954
Do you agree
with the court's verdict?

1205
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:51,639
<i>The results are in.</i>

1206
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:55,236
<i>Jean-Claude Van Damme has been convicted
for 3 years. One year jail time</i>

1207
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:57,317
<i>two years probation...</i>

1208
01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:01,915
<i>Jean-Claude Van Damme,
as mentioned earlier,</i>

1209
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:05,237
<i>will serve 1 year
for extortion of funds.</i>

1210
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:09,552
He should serve his sentence
in a prison in Brussels' suburbs.

1211
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:13,838
And this ends
the thrilling judicial series.

1212
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:17,595
<i>We just heard
of the incredible escape...</i>

1213
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:25,274
<i>If the knee is lower than the foot,
like this...</i>

1214
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:28,790
<i>You won't have any strength.
Lower, which is bad...</i>

1215
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:31,638
I'm gonna kick like this,
with no power. Check...

1216
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:33,314
Knee too low...

1217
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:36,517
If I put my knee high,
I can even kick higher. Go higher.

1218
01:26:36,518 --> 01:26:37,648
Then I go... Bam!

1219
01:26:37,649 --> 01:26:39,968
- It's something moving.
- Van Damme...

1220
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:41,388
Harder!

1221
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:43,259
And what if somebody come at me
with a knife?

1222
01:26:43,294 --> 01:26:44,757
- Van Damme, visit...
- A knife?

1223
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:46,512
Then I keep my distance,
and my knee high...

1224
01:26:46,680 --> 01:26:48,399
You have a knife,
I go inside you

1225
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:50,309
or I can go above
you. Do you understand?

1226
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:52,834
Van Damme!
Visiting room!

1227
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:54,753
I'm coming.
I'm coming.

1228
01:26:56,280 --> 01:26:57,759
It's my mother.

1229
01:26:58,120 --> 01:26:59,678
See you, guys.
Thank you.

1230
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:17,119
How are you, Mom?

1231
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:19,469
Aren't you cold?

1232
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:23,076
No, no. I just gave the
guys a karate lesson...

1233
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:25,674
- You teach karate?
- Yeah, keeps me busy.

1234
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:26,875
That's nice.

1235
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:29,992
Your father asked
how you were doing and

1236
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:32,435
wanted to tell you stuff...

1237
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:33,350
Is he OK?

1238
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:36,439
I'll be right back.
I have a surprise.

1239
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:39,319
- Excuse me?
- I have a surprise for you.

1240
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:42,159
- I've had plenty of surprises.
- Wait a sec.

1241
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:43,753
We don't have much time.
