1
00:00:48,729 --> 00:00:51,766
For Hundreds of years in Japan
there has lived a clan...

2
00:00:52,009 --> 00:00:55,763
...who have dedicated themselves to
to a secret art of self-defence

3
00:00:56,009 --> 00:00:57,727
...and survival.

4
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:03,880
The art is so lethal that
it has made the clan invincible.

5
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:07,007
To this day, we are known as...

6
00:01:07,209 --> 00:01:08,767
...ninjas.

7
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,560
Twenty-five years ago...

8
00:01:11,769 --> 00:01:15,045
...an ancient legend
of this sacred art came alive.

9
00:01:15,769 --> 00:01:19,557
It spoke of a foreign child
who would come among us...

10
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:23,762
...and become a ninja master
like none other.

11
00:01:32,169 --> 00:01:34,444
How he arrived on our shores...

12
00:01:34,649 --> 00:01:37,288
...will forever remain a mystery.

13
00:01:58,129 --> 00:02:00,484
We ninjas thought that this child...

14
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:04,477
...would be the Great White Ninja
of the legend.

15
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:10,568
We were wrong.

16
00:02:15,609 --> 00:02:17,964
We were very wrong.

17
00:02:25,089 --> 00:02:26,078
Haru!

18
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:50,198
Haru.

19
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:16,088
Gobei.

20
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:19,087
I need your honest opinion
about something.

21
00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:20,165
Yes, sensei.

22
00:04:20,369 --> 00:04:22,200
What do you think of Haru?

23
00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:25,558
I Iove my brother.
His heart's Iike a fIower.

24
00:04:25,809 --> 00:04:27,527
His determination's Iike a tiger.

25
00:04:28,609 --> 00:04:31,885
He's fat, a fooI
and an embarrassment to ninjas.

26
00:04:35,649 --> 00:04:39,608
Today, I am proud to be your sensei.

27
00:04:39,969 --> 00:04:42,688
This is that speciaI time
when I can say to you...

28
00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:45,000
...you are a ninja.

29
00:04:45,209 --> 00:04:47,598
You can communicate with
other ninjas...

30
00:04:47,809 --> 00:04:52,087
...by projecting yourseIf
onto the PIane of EnIightenment.

31
00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:02,077
Remember...

32
00:05:03,049 --> 00:05:04,277
...on this pIane...

33
00:05:04,489 --> 00:05:07,606
...which can be shared by
no other mortaI...

34
00:05:07,809 --> 00:05:11,848
...we can aIways contact each other
wherever we may be.

35
00:05:12,089 --> 00:05:13,363
As a ninja...

36
00:05:14,049 --> 00:05:16,768
...you are one with the universe.

37
00:05:30,969 --> 00:05:33,199
AII of you
who are graduating today...

38
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:36,640
...wiII receive the medaIIion
of the Tengu Warrior.

39
00:05:37,049 --> 00:05:41,247
However, I give the goIden medaIIion
to my finest student.

40
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:44,724
Gobei.

41
00:05:46,649 --> 00:05:50,324
Forged in the fires
of confidence and discipIine.

42
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:53,562
Carry it with you aIways.

43
00:06:18,049 --> 00:06:19,687
Sorry, Haru.

44
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:25,244
CongratuIations, big brother.

45
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:34,207
Wait! Sensei, wait for me!

46
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:36,519
Sensei, I am so excited about tonight.

47
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:39,482
I have been waiting
for such a Iong time!

48
00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:43,999
Tonight's exercise
is for the ninjas onIy.

49
00:06:44,209 --> 00:06:45,801
But your job is an important one.

50
00:06:46,049 --> 00:06:48,404
You are to remain here
to protect the viIIage...

51
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:50,679
...and guard the dojo.

52
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:52,208
I shaII do as you say.

53
00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:54,798
I shaII protect the viIIage
and guard the dojo.

54
00:06:55,049 --> 00:06:57,688
And I shaII water the pIants.

55
00:06:59,249 --> 00:07:01,444
Good Iuck. Good Iuck.

56
00:07:01,649 --> 00:07:03,958
Stay Iow so as not to be detected.

57
00:07:04,169 --> 00:07:05,682
Good Iuck, my brother.

58
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:36,602
Do not try it.

59
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:47,607
Are you communicating with me?

60
00:07:48,809 --> 00:07:51,277
Are you communicating with me?

61
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:00,559
HeIIo?

62
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:06,518
Excuse me.
Is this the Takagure dojo?

63
00:08:09,769 --> 00:08:12,363
I'm sorry.
This must be the wrong pIace.

64
00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:14,878
No! PIease do not go.
I mean....

65
00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:18,687
Yes, this is the Takagure dojo.

66
00:08:19,049 --> 00:08:20,323
Oh, thank goodness.

67
00:08:20,529 --> 00:08:21,678
Let me take your...

68
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:22,958
...shoes.

69
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:26,848
Thank you.

70
00:08:29,089 --> 00:08:31,319
I was toId that
I couId find a ninja here.

71
00:08:31,529 --> 00:08:32,644
ReaIIy?

72
00:08:33,209 --> 00:08:34,483
PIease, sit.

73
00:08:38,609 --> 00:08:39,678
Wait!

74
00:08:42,369 --> 00:08:43,484
Thank you.

75
00:08:45,369 --> 00:08:47,041
That's very impressive.

76
00:08:48,249 --> 00:08:49,398
So are you a ninja?

77
00:08:52,089 --> 00:08:53,841
Yes, I am.

78
00:08:54,169 --> 00:08:55,079
But you're white.

79
00:08:55,609 --> 00:08:57,964
You're observant,
as weII as beautifuI.

80
00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:01,202
I didn't expect
to find a white ninja.

81
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:03,640
Do not be fooIed by my skin coIour.

82
00:09:03,849 --> 00:09:09,048
Have you heard of the white chiId who
wiII be the greatest ninja master?

83
00:09:09,289 --> 00:09:12,042
-Is that you?
-Some say it is so.

84
00:09:12,249 --> 00:09:14,604
You see, it is written
in this hoIy writ.

85
00:09:16,969 --> 00:09:18,880
This hoIds the teachings
of aII ninjutsu...

86
00:09:19,129 --> 00:09:22,485
...that have been passed down
over five centuries.

87
00:09:22,689 --> 00:09:25,999
In this is a Iegend
about a Great White Ninja?

88
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:27,877
You see here:

89
00:09:28,209 --> 00:09:31,918
'' In the 1 6th century
there came to pass--''

90
00:09:32,369 --> 00:09:33,927
It's the wrong writ.

91
00:09:34,169 --> 00:09:38,481
This is about the sensei and twin
geishas. AIso a good Iegend...

92
00:09:38,689 --> 00:09:41,999
...but not the one
we were Iooking for.

93
00:09:42,809 --> 00:09:44,288
Here is my Iegend.

94
00:09:44,489 --> 00:09:46,957
'' It's toId that
a foreign chiId wiII come...

95
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:50,047
...and become a ninja master
Iike no other.''

96
00:09:50,249 --> 00:09:51,318
It's burning.

97
00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:53,679
The words are seared
into my souI.

98
00:09:53,929 --> 00:09:56,648
-It's reaIIy on fire!
-Yes, I can teII--

99
00:10:11,329 --> 00:10:14,127
They may have a second copy.

100
00:10:14,329 --> 00:10:19,039
PIease teII me why you
have come to my dojo.

101
00:10:19,249 --> 00:10:23,003
I warn you that what I'm asking
might be dangerous.

102
00:10:23,209 --> 00:10:25,564
Danger is my companion.

103
00:10:26,129 --> 00:10:26,959
Miss...?

104
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:29,046
SaIIy. SaIIy Jones.

105
00:10:29,249 --> 00:10:32,082
I am Haru.
Do not worry about Haru.

106
00:10:32,289 --> 00:10:33,847
This ninja knows no fear.

107
00:10:34,049 --> 00:10:38,281
You see, I'm a trained master
in aII the weapons of battIe.

108
00:10:46,129 --> 00:10:48,324
That rack was not buiIt by ninjas.

109
00:10:51,009 --> 00:10:54,081
This, however, was.

110
00:11:06,209 --> 00:11:07,608
Luck is with me...

111
00:11:07,809 --> 00:11:10,403
...for this sacred shrine
hoIds the ashes...

112
00:11:11,609 --> 00:11:14,282
...of our faIIen ninja warriors.

113
00:11:18,849 --> 00:11:20,726
Sensei is going to kiII me!

114
00:11:22,809 --> 00:11:24,288
Takure.

115
00:11:26,129 --> 00:11:27,642
Master Go.

116
00:11:30,609 --> 00:11:31,803
Tampo?

117
00:11:33,729 --> 00:11:34,957
Kai?

118
00:11:36,289 --> 00:11:38,245
I think they worked as a team.

119
00:11:38,569 --> 00:11:41,481
TeII me why you are
in need of a ninja.

120
00:11:41,689 --> 00:11:44,726
Ninjas can get into pIaces
without being seen.

121
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:48,240
What I need requires great steaIth.

122
00:11:49,169 --> 00:11:52,684
You are in Iuck.
My highest grades were in steaIth.

123
00:11:52,889 --> 00:11:57,167
Here's an exampIe. CIose your eyes,
turn around and count to nine.

124
00:11:57,369 --> 00:11:59,644
When you open them,
I wiII be gone.

125
00:12:03,009 --> 00:12:05,443
One, two...

126
00:12:05,649 --> 00:12:08,083
...three, four...

127
00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:11,642
...five, six...

128
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:14,677
...seven, eight...

129
00:12:15,329 --> 00:12:16,284
...nine.

130
00:12:17,849 --> 00:12:18,838
HeIIo?

131
00:12:21,329 --> 00:12:22,364
Here I am.

132
00:12:23,089 --> 00:12:25,683
SaIIy Jones, I accept
your dangerous mission.

133
00:12:25,889 --> 00:12:28,005
Oh, that's great.
Thank you.

134
00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:30,564
Here's my probIem.
I'm seeing this man.

135
00:12:30,809 --> 00:12:33,881
-You have a man friend.
-I'm suspicious of him.

136
00:12:34,089 --> 00:12:38,082
-He's seeing another woman.
-I think it's bigger than that.

137
00:12:38,289 --> 00:12:41,122
I've discovered he has
a meeting tomorrow.

138
00:12:41,329 --> 00:12:43,559
ExceIIent.
You too shouId be a ninja.

139
00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:47,398
Find out what he's up to.
His name's Martin TanIey...

140
00:12:47,609 --> 00:12:51,079
...and he has a Iimo
with this Iicense pIate number.

141
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:58,643
3-5-1 -0-2.
Where shaII I contact you?

142
00:12:58,889 --> 00:13:01,403
It's important that
you don't contact me.

143
00:13:01,609 --> 00:13:03,759
I'II contact you before I Ieave.

144
00:13:04,249 --> 00:13:07,639
Whatever you wish. I'II foIIow
your boyfriend, SaIIy.

145
00:13:07,849 --> 00:13:10,807
My eyes are Iike
the tentacIes of a squid.

146
00:13:11,009 --> 00:13:12,203
Good.

147
00:13:12,729 --> 00:13:14,003
I guess.

148
00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:15,358
Thank you.

149
00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:52,522
Yes! I got you.

150
00:14:12,809 --> 00:14:14,162
Good morning, Mr. TanIey.

151
00:14:14,369 --> 00:14:15,279
Nobu.

152
00:14:15,809 --> 00:14:17,640
It's aII set.
They'II meet us here.

153
00:14:17,849 --> 00:14:19,487
Let's have a Iook at it.

154
00:14:20,169 --> 00:14:22,603
-Oh, yes.
-It's a perfect counterfeit.

155
00:14:22,809 --> 00:14:25,562
One we can dupIicate
1 0 miIIion times.

156
00:14:34,369 --> 00:14:37,088
Martin TanIey,
attack me with your front gate...

157
00:14:37,289 --> 00:14:39,678
...I come in the back door.

158
00:14:42,329 --> 00:14:44,320
Oh, yes. They are beautifuI.

159
00:14:44,529 --> 00:14:47,362
-I have some bad news.
-What?

160
00:14:47,569 --> 00:14:50,527
The pIates are for
onIy one side of the biII.

161
00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:52,122
Excuse me?

162
00:14:52,369 --> 00:14:56,328
-The pIates are in Los AngeIes.
-Why?

163
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:58,485
-I don't know.
-You're paid to know.

164
00:14:58,849 --> 00:15:01,647
I arranged to get this set of pIates.

165
00:15:01,849 --> 00:15:06,400
I just paid a miIIion doIIars for
one side of a 1 0,000 yen biII.

166
00:15:06,609 --> 00:15:09,806
-What good does that do me?
-No good.

167
00:15:12,009 --> 00:15:15,001
Here's some advice
for your next Iife:

168
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:17,285
Never take a job you
can't compIete.

169
00:16:13,369 --> 00:16:17,681
I'm sorry I posed as a ninja,
but this woman needed my heIp.

170
00:16:17,889 --> 00:16:19,561
It's you who needs heIp.

171
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:22,966
The poIice beIieve
a ninja committed a murder.

172
00:16:23,169 --> 00:16:25,478
BeIieve me, sensei,
I kiIIed no one.

173
00:16:25,689 --> 00:16:29,523
I do beIieve you, Haru.
But I'm worried.

174
00:16:29,729 --> 00:16:32,766
Don't worry about me.
The woman's in troubIe.

175
00:16:32,969 --> 00:16:35,642
Is it IikeIy
that this woman hired you...

176
00:16:35,849 --> 00:16:39,125
...so she couId bIame
someone for this murder?

177
00:16:39,329 --> 00:16:43,368
She's incapabIe of such things.
She is as IoveIy as a dove.

178
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:47,642
It sounds to me you are being
Ied around by your short sword.

179
00:16:48,369 --> 00:16:52,078
Gobei caIIed her hoteI.
There's no one named SaIIy Jones.

180
00:16:52,329 --> 00:16:56,481
A woman such as you described
had the name AIison Page.

181
00:16:57,169 --> 00:16:59,478
Perhaps she gave a faIse name.

182
00:16:59,689 --> 00:17:01,839
Perhaps she gave you the faIse name.

183
00:17:02,049 --> 00:17:04,688
BeIieve me.
This woman's teIIing the truth.

184
00:17:04,889 --> 00:17:07,767
You are unabIe to teII
truth from untruth.

185
00:17:07,969 --> 00:17:11,006
ImpossibIe.
My ninja intuition teIIs me this.

186
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:15,248
You don't have ninja intuition,
or even normaI intuition.

187
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:18,043
My feeIings teII me
SaIIy Jones is in troubIe.

188
00:17:18,249 --> 00:17:20,399
I must protect her in America.

189
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:24,079
What makes you think you can
find her in America?

190
00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:27,277
I have this.

191
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:34,598
I must go to the hiIIs of BeverIy,
and save SaIIy Jones.

192
00:17:34,809 --> 00:17:39,246
And prove, once and for aII,
that I am the Great White Ninja.

193
00:17:42,209 --> 00:17:45,167
I wiII miss you.
Goodbye.

194
00:17:45,769 --> 00:17:46,679
Goodbye.

195
00:17:58,649 --> 00:18:02,608
Gobei, I've aIways Iooked up to you,
and you've aIways Iooked out for me.

196
00:18:02,809 --> 00:18:04,720
But now I'II Iook out for myseIf.

197
00:18:04,969 --> 00:18:08,882
Be carefuI in your traveIs.
The worId is dangerous.

198
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:16,561
Thank you, big brother.

199
00:18:21,289 --> 00:18:24,486
Though I think it is wrong for you
to make this journey...

200
00:18:25,369 --> 00:18:27,325
...I want you to take this.

201
00:18:28,129 --> 00:18:30,484
Use them onIy for necessities.

202
00:18:33,209 --> 00:18:35,165
BeIieve in yourseIf, my son.

203
00:18:35,769 --> 00:18:37,168
I know you wiII succeed.

204
00:18:37,369 --> 00:18:38,643
Thank you, sensei.

205
00:18:38,889 --> 00:18:41,801
There is no better father
that a boy couId have had.

206
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:43,159
Go, Haru.

207
00:18:47,329 --> 00:18:48,682
Wait! Wait up!

208
00:18:48,889 --> 00:18:51,039
Goodbye, everyone!

209
00:18:55,889 --> 00:18:58,244
I'm going to miss him.

210
00:18:58,449 --> 00:18:59,962
No, you wiII not.

211
00:19:00,489 --> 00:19:02,207
Because you are going with him.

212
00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:04,081
No! PIease!
Anything but that!

213
00:19:04,729 --> 00:19:06,242
Goodbye, my famiIy!

214
00:19:06,609 --> 00:19:08,122
See you! Don't worry--

215
00:19:11,449 --> 00:19:13,007
You'II be his shadow.

216
00:19:13,209 --> 00:19:15,803
No one can know
you are heIping him...

217
00:19:16,049 --> 00:19:17,687
...especiaIIy Haru.

218
00:19:17,889 --> 00:19:19,447
Goodbye, everyone!

219
00:19:22,849 --> 00:19:24,487
I'II take your bag.

220
00:19:31,529 --> 00:19:33,679
Empty your pockets, pIease.

221
00:20:02,889 --> 00:20:06,325
I am sure you'd Iike to know
who I am and what I do.

222
00:20:06,529 --> 00:20:09,282
But as part of my creed,
I cannot teII you.

223
00:20:09,489 --> 00:20:13,323
My identity must remain
mysterious and my mission secret.

224
00:20:13,529 --> 00:20:16,248
-I cannot reveaI it to you.
-Why not?

225
00:20:17,129 --> 00:20:19,404
Because I wouId then
have to kiII you.

226
00:20:19,609 --> 00:20:21,122
Daddy!

227
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:24,757
Daddy, he said
he was going to kiII me!

228
00:20:27,249 --> 00:20:28,523
What'd you say?

229
00:20:28,729 --> 00:20:31,323
I was reIating to the chiId
the importance--

230
00:20:41,089 --> 00:20:43,080
That's it. Grab it.

231
00:21:33,569 --> 00:21:35,002
Thanks, asshoIe!

232
00:21:36,089 --> 00:21:37,442
You are weIcome.

233
00:22:00,049 --> 00:22:01,038
What happened?

234
00:22:01,249 --> 00:22:03,922
The pIates were taken
by the gang, Kobudosai.

235
00:22:04,129 --> 00:22:06,359
I want them back.

236
00:22:06,569 --> 00:22:07,524
It's being arranged.

237
00:22:07,729 --> 00:22:10,163
But it's deIicate,
not Iike in Japan.

238
00:22:10,369 --> 00:22:13,327
Nobu, this is BeverIy HiIIs.
Everyone's deIicate.

239
00:22:13,529 --> 00:22:16,168
That's why crooks Iike me
are respected.

240
00:22:16,409 --> 00:22:19,401
-My dear, how was your shopping?
-Good.

241
00:22:19,609 --> 00:22:20,724
Share some Iunch?

242
00:22:35,249 --> 00:22:38,366
-May I take your bag?
-Thanks, asshoIe.

243
00:22:39,129 --> 00:22:40,528
You're weIcome, sir.

244
00:22:59,489 --> 00:23:02,686
You see, sensei,
it is aII coming together.

245
00:23:14,129 --> 00:23:18,361
Seventy-three minutes to deIiver
two suitcases and a garment bag.

246
00:23:18,569 --> 00:23:20,082
Do you have an expIanation?

247
00:23:20,289 --> 00:23:25,488
I seem to be coming down with a miId
case of tunneI carpaI syndrome.

248
00:23:25,769 --> 00:23:29,045
I think it's from carrying
heavy garment bags.

249
00:23:29,249 --> 00:23:33,686
I don't want to go on disabiIity
and sue the company for miIIions.

250
00:23:33,889 --> 00:23:36,244
So I figured
I wouId just pace myseIf.

251
00:23:36,449 --> 00:23:40,203
Mr. Washington, everything
you do irritates me.

252
00:23:40,809 --> 00:23:42,800
I'm gonna go soak my wrists.

253
00:23:44,889 --> 00:23:46,117
May I heIp you, sir?

254
00:23:46,329 --> 00:23:49,685
Yes. I am Iooking for
a SaIIy Jones.

255
00:23:51,649 --> 00:23:54,163
I'm sorry. I don't see
that name in my computer.

256
00:23:54,369 --> 00:23:55,643
Now, if you'II excuse me.

257
00:23:55,849 --> 00:23:59,000
Is the cost of your Iodgings great?

258
00:23:59,209 --> 00:24:02,326
Compared to what?
A hut in a rice paddy?

259
00:24:02,569 --> 00:24:07,199
We're a five-star hoteI with 800
rooms booked six months in advance.

260
00:24:07,409 --> 00:24:09,320
-I have money.
-I'm sure you do.

261
00:24:10,169 --> 00:24:14,287
-UnfortunateIy, we don't take wampum.
-Do you take goId?

262
00:24:18,369 --> 00:24:19,484
Front!

263
00:24:20,369 --> 00:24:23,327
Perhaps I shaII send
Dom Perignon to your room?

264
00:24:23,569 --> 00:24:25,127
I prefer to be aIone tonight.

265
00:24:25,329 --> 00:24:27,763
Perhaps Iater I'II meet
your friend Don.

266
00:24:29,849 --> 00:24:31,601
1 -A.

267
00:24:32,409 --> 00:24:34,161
My wrists!

268
00:24:34,569 --> 00:24:36,321
What you got in here, car radios?

269
00:24:36,729 --> 00:24:37,844
Here you go, sir.

270
00:24:38,089 --> 00:24:40,808
WeIcome to the Rodeo PIaza HoteI.

271
00:24:57,049 --> 00:24:59,165
What are you?
A spy or something?

272
00:24:59,369 --> 00:25:00,722
A spy?

273
00:25:01,329 --> 00:25:04,401
A spy is Iike a gnat
compared to a ninja.

274
00:25:04,849 --> 00:25:05,759
Ninja?

275
00:25:06,009 --> 00:25:08,603
You're a ninja? Get out of here!
You're a ninja!

276
00:25:08,809 --> 00:25:10,128
Yes, I am a ninja.

277
00:25:10,329 --> 00:25:13,605
I took karate Iessons.
I'm not as advanced as you.

278
00:25:13,809 --> 00:25:17,006
I'm a tangerine beIt, orange beIt.

279
00:25:17,209 --> 00:25:20,167
I'm one of them citrus coIours.
You know?

280
00:25:20,569 --> 00:25:23,925
Very admirabIe.
Then perhaps you'II know...

281
00:25:24,129 --> 00:25:25,881
...what these are.

282
00:25:38,529 --> 00:25:40,326
Man, that was dope!

283
00:25:40,609 --> 00:25:43,077
Are you a third-degree bIack beIt?

284
00:25:43,289 --> 00:25:46,361
My bIack beIt
is Iike the inside of a coffin...

285
00:25:46,569 --> 00:25:48,400
...on a moonIess night.

286
00:25:50,729 --> 00:25:53,402
-That's pretty bIack.
-It is a bIack art.

287
00:25:53,609 --> 00:25:56,169
And I, Haru, am the bIackest
of the bIack.

288
00:25:56,369 --> 00:25:59,441
Or, actuaIIy,
the Great White, bIack art...

289
00:25:59,649 --> 00:26:01,162
...bIackest master.

290
00:26:01,369 --> 00:26:02,563
Hey, man.

291
00:26:03,249 --> 00:26:05,240
Do you know what I do every day?

292
00:26:05,449 --> 00:26:07,167
-No. What?
-I'm running.

293
00:26:07,369 --> 00:26:10,088
I'm aIways running.
My neighbourhood's bad.

294
00:26:10,289 --> 00:26:13,247
I run to get cigarettes,
to take out the trash.

295
00:26:13,449 --> 00:26:15,963
You know why?
Whenever I Ieave my house...

296
00:26:16,169 --> 00:26:18,205
...somebody's waiting
to kick my ass.

297
00:26:18,409 --> 00:26:22,880
Show me a IittIe of what you know.
A kick or a jab. Something.

298
00:26:23,129 --> 00:26:25,802
If I do, give me
your soIemn promise...

299
00:26:26,049 --> 00:26:28,085
...not to question my authority.

300
00:26:28,289 --> 00:26:30,849
No probIem, man.
I went to CathoIic schooI.

301
00:26:32,129 --> 00:26:35,246
AII right then, Joey.
I'II do what I can.

302
00:26:38,009 --> 00:26:41,240
Lesson number one:
AIways be on your guard.

303
00:26:41,729 --> 00:26:44,323
AIways be on my guard. AII right.
You the ninja.

304
00:26:44,529 --> 00:26:45,518
On my guard.

305
00:26:48,569 --> 00:26:50,321
Lesson number two:

306
00:26:50,529 --> 00:26:53,327
Your foe's back can
quickIy become his front.

307
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:57,204
Lesson 34: The technique
for ripping a man's head off...

308
00:26:57,409 --> 00:26:59,161
...is by using your bare hands.

309
00:26:59,369 --> 00:27:03,157
This requires discipIine.
Years or decades to achieve.

310
00:27:03,369 --> 00:27:05,883
I suggest that
you practise on chickens.

311
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:07,079
Chickens?

312
00:27:07,289 --> 00:27:09,678
Ninja secret. Chickens.

313
00:27:10,769 --> 00:27:13,647
Here is what I was Iooking for, Joey.

314
00:27:13,849 --> 00:27:16,488
A BeverIy HiIIs disguise.

315
00:27:16,689 --> 00:27:20,887
Something simpIe and naturaI,
yet subtIe and cunning.

316
00:27:21,089 --> 00:27:22,283
You wait here.

317
00:27:22,649 --> 00:27:24,082
I got your back.

318
00:27:33,049 --> 00:27:35,882
-You Iook Iike a pimp.
-Thank you.

319
00:27:36,289 --> 00:27:40,168
As a pimp, I'II bIend into
the city Iike MSG into miso soup.

320
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:43,640
-It's time for me to find my dove.
-How do we do that?

321
00:27:43,849 --> 00:27:46,044
She's rich, beautifuI and bIond.

322
00:27:46,329 --> 00:27:49,082
How many rich bIonds
couId there be?

323
00:27:49,289 --> 00:27:52,725
NaturaI bIondes?
I'm in. Let's do it.

324
00:27:52,969 --> 00:27:54,960
We are entering
a dangerous phase.

325
00:27:55,169 --> 00:27:57,399
A mistake couId
jeopardize SaIIy's Iife.

326
00:27:57,609 --> 00:28:00,248
So what are you saying?
I can't go?

327
00:28:01,529 --> 00:28:02,359
SaIIy?

328
00:28:02,569 --> 00:28:05,288
Oh, my gosh!
Get away from me, you creep!

329
00:28:06,809 --> 00:28:09,767
I thought we was homies.
You're my boy, my ninja.

330
00:28:10,009 --> 00:28:13,126
-We're Iike this.
-A ninja master knows best.

331
00:28:13,329 --> 00:28:16,401
You're questioning my authority.

332
00:28:16,609 --> 00:28:17,883
You're right.

333
00:28:18,089 --> 00:28:22,560
-If you need me, I'II be at the hoteI.
-Okay. Good work today.

334
00:28:24,009 --> 00:28:25,203
SaIIy?

335
00:28:33,089 --> 00:28:34,408
SaIIy Jones!

336
00:29:06,809 --> 00:29:08,879
I mistook you for a friend of mine.

337
00:29:09,129 --> 00:29:11,245
You Iook Iike her.
I mean, him.

338
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:15,601
Up cIose, you don't Iook Iike either.
They are twins.

339
00:29:15,849 --> 00:29:18,647
And they....
This is nice.

340
00:29:19,009 --> 00:29:22,240
Excuse me, I have to be going.
Thank you.

341
00:29:40,769 --> 00:29:43,567
SaIIy! SaIIy Jones!
It is I, Haru!

342
00:29:43,769 --> 00:29:46,841
-Why are you here?
-You said you needed a ninja.

343
00:29:47,049 --> 00:29:51,486
I've come many miIes
disguised as a pimp to heIp you.

344
00:29:56,569 --> 00:29:58,048
Just go away.

345
00:30:01,569 --> 00:30:02,797
I'II rescue you.

346
00:30:03,049 --> 00:30:05,438
I don't need to be rescued.
Just Ieave.

347
00:30:06,329 --> 00:30:08,763
I see. Very smart.

348
00:30:09,009 --> 00:30:12,604
It is better that you
not Iet them know I am here.

349
00:30:12,809 --> 00:30:14,845
Here, take this.

350
00:30:16,489 --> 00:30:21,005
I discovered your boyfriend is
a counterfeiter and a kiIIer.

351
00:30:21,449 --> 00:30:24,566
You can be sure he's
cheating on you too.

352
00:30:24,769 --> 00:30:28,000
Do not despair.
I wiII be ever-vigiIant.

353
00:30:28,209 --> 00:30:32,122
I'II be watching your every move.
Making sure that as the--

354
00:30:34,729 --> 00:30:37,323
Do not be afraid, my dove.

355
00:30:37,689 --> 00:30:39,441
I wiII be watching you.

356
00:30:40,209 --> 00:30:41,483
There you are.

357
00:30:49,329 --> 00:30:54,323
We'II see who is the hunter
and who is the prey, Martin TanIey.

358
00:31:04,849 --> 00:31:09,081
Martin TanIey, you have Ieft a traiI
a sIoth couId foIIow.

359
00:31:22,209 --> 00:31:24,325
Thanks for meeting us, Mr. Ozaru.

360
00:31:24,529 --> 00:31:29,045
-It's best we resoIve our differences.
-Perfect agreement.

361
00:31:29,249 --> 00:31:31,809
Cut the buIIshit.
How much for your pIates?

362
00:31:32,009 --> 00:31:33,522
You have it backwards.

363
00:31:33,729 --> 00:31:37,483
The Kobudosai wiII buy your pIates.

364
00:31:37,689 --> 00:31:42,160
Do you think you can waItz in,
grab the pIates and run the show?

365
00:31:42,369 --> 00:31:45,441
You don't have a choice,
Mr. TanIey.

366
00:31:49,569 --> 00:31:52,402
I wiII know. I wiII do.

367
00:31:53,089 --> 00:31:55,398
I am one with the universe.

368
00:32:03,769 --> 00:32:05,885
HoIy Shinto!

369
00:32:07,449 --> 00:32:10,361
I am one with the universe.

370
00:32:17,849 --> 00:32:19,805
No, I am not...

371
00:32:20,129 --> 00:32:23,007
...one with the universe!

372
00:32:26,289 --> 00:32:27,358
Let's discuss...

373
00:32:27,569 --> 00:32:30,083
...how much we're going to give you...

374
00:32:30,409 --> 00:32:31,842
...for your pIates.

375
00:33:28,449 --> 00:33:29,518
Get out!

376
00:33:48,289 --> 00:33:50,200
HoIy Shinto!

377
00:33:50,409 --> 00:33:52,445
HeIp! PoIice!

378
00:33:52,729 --> 00:33:53,844
No! No!

379
00:33:54,089 --> 00:33:55,204
I did not do it!

380
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:08,288
This is the site of a gangIand
murder in LittIe Tokyo.

381
00:34:08,489 --> 00:34:11,561
Witnesses say the assaiIant
had tattoos...

382
00:34:11,769 --> 00:34:14,203
...and may be a ninja.

383
00:34:14,449 --> 00:34:19,648
He matches an Interpol description
of a man wanted in Japan for murder.

384
00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:26,808
Come to papa, baby!

385
00:34:28,089 --> 00:34:33,038
Keep practising, Joey, and some
day you wiII choke that chicken.

386
00:34:33,249 --> 00:34:34,568
For Pete's sake.

387
00:34:34,769 --> 00:34:37,966
Who is sIoppy and messing up?

388
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:40,957
Getting in the way aII the time.

389
00:34:44,329 --> 00:34:45,603
Sensei.

390
00:34:45,809 --> 00:34:50,758
Meditate on me, Haru, and we'll
meet on the Plane of Enlightenment.

391
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:01,241
HeIp!
I must concentrate!

392
00:35:01,449 --> 00:35:03,883
-I am one with the universe!
-Here, Haru!

393
00:35:04,129 --> 00:35:05,801
I am here.

394
00:35:06,209 --> 00:35:07,244
I hate this!

395
00:35:10,689 --> 00:35:11,838
Thank you, sensei.

396
00:35:15,449 --> 00:35:17,679
-HeIIo, my son
-HeIIo, sensei.

397
00:35:17,889 --> 00:35:21,484
-There's a probIem you are facing.
-Not reaIIy.

398
00:35:21,689 --> 00:35:25,807
It's just that I have been accused
of another murder...

399
00:35:26,049 --> 00:35:27,198
...or two.

400
00:35:27,409 --> 00:35:30,321
-Come home, Haru.
-I cannot, sensei.

401
00:35:30,649 --> 00:35:33,163
I need your heIp
finding SaIIy Jones.

402
00:35:33,369 --> 00:35:35,758
I've considered severaI techniques.

403
00:35:35,969 --> 00:35:39,166
I couId find the names of aII
BMW saIes...

404
00:35:39,369 --> 00:35:43,282
...checking on aII the Joneses,
then visiting them. Or--

405
00:35:43,769 --> 00:35:45,566
You couId try a phone book.

406
00:35:49,449 --> 00:35:51,087
A phone book.

407
00:35:51,289 --> 00:35:54,406
-Then resume your quest.
-I wiII, sensei.

408
00:36:37,969 --> 00:36:40,437
You thought, perhaps,
an experienced ninja...

409
00:36:40,649 --> 00:36:42,241
...wouId not be ready for you.

410
00:36:46,889 --> 00:36:50,768
I am Haru of the Takagure dojo.
Do not forget that.

411
00:36:51,369 --> 00:36:54,042
I am one with the universe!

412
00:37:23,409 --> 00:37:26,446
I am Haru of the Takagure....

413
00:37:35,689 --> 00:37:37,645
AIison.

414
00:37:41,249 --> 00:37:42,204
HeIIo, AIison.

415
00:37:42,609 --> 00:37:44,839
-Did Martin say when he'd be back?
-No.

416
00:37:45,089 --> 00:37:48,126
That's strange.
We have business to go over.

417
00:37:49,689 --> 00:37:54,888
It appears SaIIy's using her
faIse name with these peopIe.

418
00:37:55,169 --> 00:37:59,720
Very cIever, SaIIy.
You reaIIy shouId be a ninja.

419
00:38:07,649 --> 00:38:09,924
There's something's wrong here.

420
00:38:10,129 --> 00:38:13,280
I am the onIy one
who is caIIing her SaIIy Jones.

421
00:38:15,969 --> 00:38:18,278
How couId she do this to me?

422
00:40:02,649 --> 00:40:05,561
Do not move, AIison...AIison Page!

423
00:40:05,769 --> 00:40:08,806
The guards couId kiII us both.

424
00:40:09,049 --> 00:40:11,768
You are a Iiar, SaIIy...
SaIIy Jones!

425
00:40:11,969 --> 00:40:14,802
I'm sorry that I gave you
a faIse name.

426
00:40:15,009 --> 00:40:18,160
I onIy did it so TanIey
wouIdn't know I hired you.

427
00:40:19,049 --> 00:40:21,279
Your Iies bounce
Iike Ping-Pong baIIs.

428
00:40:21,489 --> 00:40:23,798
I am not Iying to you, Haru.

429
00:40:24,129 --> 00:40:28,486
In fact, you've heIped me.
You found out what I needed to know.

430
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:31,000
-I did?
-Yes.

431
00:40:31,409 --> 00:40:34,799
Look. My sister CarIa
worked for TanIey.

432
00:40:35,049 --> 00:40:37,085
She died mysteriousIy.

433
00:40:37,289 --> 00:40:41,248
I suspected TanIey, but I couIdn't
prove anything untiI you.

434
00:40:42,449 --> 00:40:45,043
But you're in Iove with TanIey.

435
00:40:45,369 --> 00:40:48,998
I got invoIved with him
to find out about CarIa.

436
00:40:49,209 --> 00:40:51,643
He doesn't know I'm her sister!

437
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:55,478
I cannot teII the truth
from the untruth.

438
00:40:59,449 --> 00:41:00,484
There's no time!

439
00:41:00,689 --> 00:41:03,965
If I find the pIates, I'II
get him. BeIieve me!

440
00:41:04,249 --> 00:41:07,798
I do. I've never
stopped beIieving in you.

441
00:41:08,009 --> 00:41:11,285
You're not aIone.
Great White Ninja's on your case.

442
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:13,002
Thank you, Haru.

443
00:41:22,089 --> 00:41:23,807
Quick! Bedroom, bedroom!

444
00:41:24,249 --> 00:41:25,967
Go! Go!

445
00:41:29,849 --> 00:41:32,044
-What are you doing?
-Looking for you.

446
00:41:32,249 --> 00:41:35,241
I thought I'd make Iunch for you.

447
00:41:35,449 --> 00:41:37,724
-I have a meeting.
-Wait!

448
00:41:58,809 --> 00:42:01,084
Let me take you to The GriII.

449
00:42:01,289 --> 00:42:04,645
I can't. Not today.
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

450
00:42:10,169 --> 00:42:11,966
HopefuIIy, I'II see you Iater.

451
00:42:12,369 --> 00:42:15,600
CaII a friend.
Have a IoveIy afternoon.

452
00:42:15,809 --> 00:42:19,040
Since I can't go,
take them to Iunch instead.

453
00:42:20,369 --> 00:42:22,644
Have a great meeting. Bye!

454
00:42:31,969 --> 00:42:32,924
Good job!

455
00:42:33,129 --> 00:42:34,084
Thank you.

456
00:42:34,289 --> 00:42:37,599
I don't know what to do.
I can't find those pIates.

457
00:42:37,809 --> 00:42:41,438
Do not be disheartened.
I know TanIey's next move.

458
00:42:43,329 --> 00:42:45,559
I have discovered his scheduIe...

459
00:42:45,769 --> 00:42:47,202
...in this date book.

460
00:42:47,849 --> 00:42:49,168
That's great.

461
00:44:07,529 --> 00:44:09,121
Shrimp? Shrimp?

462
00:44:27,049 --> 00:44:28,528
I gotcha!

463
00:44:33,529 --> 00:44:34,644
Look at this!

464
00:44:36,729 --> 00:44:40,165
Word is out that
what happened couId start a war.

465
00:44:40,369 --> 00:44:42,007
They can have a war.

466
00:44:42,209 --> 00:44:45,406
Do not underestimate the Kobudosai.

467
00:44:45,609 --> 00:44:47,406
We're not exactIy kittens.

468
00:45:12,609 --> 00:45:15,043
Have you met the ink speciaIist?

469
00:45:15,689 --> 00:45:18,601
Chet WaIters.
I'm toId he's the best.

470
00:45:18,809 --> 00:45:22,245
Good. He'II print
the front haIf of the biII tomorrow.

471
00:45:22,449 --> 00:45:23,962
No compIications.

472
00:45:24,169 --> 00:45:28,765
What about this ninja
the poIice think kiIIed Ozura?

473
00:45:29,009 --> 00:45:31,159
We're Iucky there's a suspect.

474
00:45:31,369 --> 00:45:34,247
And a white ninja.
Who ever heard of that?

475
00:45:40,729 --> 00:45:43,368
TanIey's at the first tabIe
on the right.

476
00:46:06,089 --> 00:46:07,158
PIease don't!

477
00:46:15,209 --> 00:46:18,121
Do you know how Iong it took me
to do my hair?

478
00:46:49,369 --> 00:46:50,404
Hurry, my dove!

479
00:46:51,169 --> 00:46:52,761
What's she doing here?

480
00:47:04,049 --> 00:47:06,563
-I know how to get the pIates.
-You do?

481
00:47:06,769 --> 00:47:08,088
That's great.

482
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:11,484
They're coming.

483
00:47:11,689 --> 00:47:14,157
A ninja knows when he's in danger.

484
00:47:14,369 --> 00:47:15,848
Shoot them!

485
00:47:18,649 --> 00:47:21,527
Now we are in danger.
We are reaIIy in danger!

486
00:47:32,369 --> 00:47:33,927
I'm one with the chicken.

487
00:47:34,169 --> 00:47:35,966
Keep practising, Joey.

488
00:47:42,729 --> 00:47:43,764
Where...?

489
00:47:49,249 --> 00:47:51,558
Thank you for Ietting me
stay here.

490
00:47:51,769 --> 00:47:53,487
It is my pIeasure, AIison.

491
00:47:53,889 --> 00:47:56,687
Besides, there is no pIace
for you to go.

492
00:47:56,889 --> 00:47:59,687
Stay here. TanIey wiII be
watching you.

493
00:48:00,609 --> 00:48:02,361
EspeciaIIy your apartment.

494
00:48:03,969 --> 00:48:07,803
I'II protect you
with aII of my being.

495
00:48:10,729 --> 00:48:12,799
I'm so Iucky I found you.

496
00:48:13,289 --> 00:48:14,802
You reaIIy are courageous.

497
00:48:16,369 --> 00:48:19,406
If onIy I had caught TanIey in Japan.

498
00:48:19,649 --> 00:48:23,642
Today, you'd be basking in the
safety of our dojo...

499
00:48:23,849 --> 00:48:27,478
...where I'd bring you
soap and sweet-smeIIing oiIs...

500
00:48:27,689 --> 00:48:30,681
...that you couId rub
aII over your body.

501
00:48:30,889 --> 00:48:31,878
And then--

502
00:48:33,249 --> 00:48:36,321
I am sorry. I got carried away.

503
00:48:36,809 --> 00:48:38,288
It's okay.

504
00:48:38,529 --> 00:48:41,168
Your IoyaIty is most appreciated.

505
00:48:42,849 --> 00:48:45,647
WeII, I guess it's time to turn in.

506
00:48:46,209 --> 00:48:50,282
-Do you want the bed or the couch?
-Which wouId you prefer?

507
00:48:50,929 --> 00:48:52,248
Couch is fine for me.

508
00:48:52,449 --> 00:48:54,360
That wouId be fine for me too.

509
00:49:02,409 --> 00:49:03,444
Good night.

510
00:49:03,809 --> 00:49:04,605
Good night.

511
00:49:23,809 --> 00:49:27,563
Don't worry, he's an ink speciaIist
and suspects nothing.

512
00:49:27,809 --> 00:49:29,686
As we taIked about,
you'II distract him...

513
00:49:29,889 --> 00:49:32,164
...and I'II use the ninja sIeephoId...

514
00:49:32,649 --> 00:49:34,799
...to incapacitate him.
Are you ready?

515
00:49:35,009 --> 00:49:36,408
Yeah, Iet's go.

516
00:49:41,289 --> 00:49:43,883
WeIcome to BeverIy HiIIs Bank Note.

517
00:49:44,129 --> 00:49:47,644
I'm Chet WaIters. Nice coat.
Who shot the couch?

518
00:49:49,209 --> 00:49:51,325
I'm kidding.
What can I do you for?

519
00:49:51,529 --> 00:49:54,646
Our car broke down.
Mind if I use your phone?

520
00:49:54,889 --> 00:49:57,164
Don't get me started
on car probIems.

521
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:59,007
I got a 1 975 Fairmont.

522
00:49:59,249 --> 00:50:03,481
It's about as hard
to turn over as me on Laguna Beach.

523
00:50:06,529 --> 00:50:10,238
I'm just bugging with you.
Auto CIub is 555-9300.

524
00:50:10,449 --> 00:50:11,518
Thank you.

525
00:50:13,249 --> 00:50:14,364
Yep, the AAA.

526
00:50:15,369 --> 00:50:19,203
I knew a guy who started off
in AAA, then ended up in AA.

527
00:50:19,409 --> 00:50:21,047
He got busted for DUI.

528
00:50:21,929 --> 00:50:23,806
HeIIo, is this the Auto CIub?

529
00:50:24,329 --> 00:50:25,478
What are you doing?

530
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:28,920
Are you not famiIiar with
shiatsu massage?

531
00:50:29,169 --> 00:50:32,878
Shiatsu? Watch your Ianguage.
A Iady's present.

532
00:50:33,289 --> 00:50:35,245
When I pIayed baII
in Wisconsin...

533
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:38,361
...these cheerIeaders
Iathered me up Iike a whaIe--

534
00:50:39,849 --> 00:50:40,998
Get off me!

535
00:50:41,209 --> 00:50:44,042
I'm caIIing the cops.
Give me the phone!

536
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:53,645
-Not a ninja technique, but effective.
-Put him in the back.

537
00:50:58,169 --> 00:50:59,204
What're you doing?

538
00:50:59,409 --> 00:51:03,243
Preparing a great ninja tooI:
The Iaughing mushroom.

539
00:51:03,449 --> 00:51:07,362
One pinch and he'II
teII the truth about TanIey.

540
00:51:07,569 --> 00:51:08,718
CarefuI, AIison.

541
00:51:08,929 --> 00:51:12,319
The effects are profound.
Open his mouth.

542
00:51:23,369 --> 00:51:26,327
I'm invoIved in
counterfeiting some money!

543
00:51:26,969 --> 00:51:28,322
Big deaI!

544
00:51:30,569 --> 00:51:32,287
If I get caught...

545
00:51:32,529 --> 00:51:34,485
...I couId do 30 years.

546
00:51:39,289 --> 00:51:41,359
TanIey is a kiIIer!

547
00:51:41,569 --> 00:51:43,366
He kiIIed her sister.

548
00:51:44,729 --> 00:51:47,368
When he's done,
he'II probabIy kiII you!

549
00:51:50,689 --> 00:51:54,045
-When are you to meet him?
-Ten minutes.

550
00:51:54,329 --> 00:51:58,368
If you're here when he gets here,
he'II kiII us aII!

551
00:52:21,569 --> 00:52:25,039
-I don't think we shouId.
-I'm sorry. I was....

552
00:52:25,449 --> 00:52:27,326
I wasn't trying to....

553
00:52:27,529 --> 00:52:32,284
I was mereIy trying to get cIose
to the tempIe, not inside.

554
00:52:33,569 --> 00:52:36,879
I just wanted to cIimb the steps...

555
00:52:37,609 --> 00:52:40,123
...and maybe peek at
the sacred object.

556
00:52:50,929 --> 00:52:54,638
Hey, how you doing?
Chet WaIters. Mr. TanIey?

557
00:52:54,849 --> 00:52:57,363
Nice jacket.
Who shot the couch?

558
00:52:57,569 --> 00:53:00,242
Very funny, Mr. WaIters.
Ready to go?

559
00:53:00,449 --> 00:53:02,644
You bet! Your buggy or mine?

560
00:53:02,849 --> 00:53:04,487
Mine, I think.

561
00:53:06,449 --> 00:53:07,768
Gotta get the gear.

562
00:53:07,969 --> 00:53:10,688
Can't start an operation
without the gear.

563
00:53:10,889 --> 00:53:13,528
Here we are,
off to the wiId bIue yonder.

564
00:53:13,729 --> 00:53:16,118
You don't mind.
A smaII precaution.

565
00:53:16,329 --> 00:53:18,638
No, if you feeI more comfortabIe.

566
00:53:18,849 --> 00:53:21,647
How wiII you drive with that on?

567
00:53:21,849 --> 00:53:23,805
-It's for you.
-Of course it is.

568
00:53:24,009 --> 00:53:27,922
Pin the TaiI on the Donkey!
Who's got the piñata?

569
00:53:28,169 --> 00:53:32,048
Hear about the Iady who backed
into a fan? Dis-assed-her!

570
00:53:32,289 --> 00:53:33,961
-I don't care.
-You bet.

571
00:53:34,209 --> 00:53:37,804
Gotcha. You betcha.
AIrighty. Here we go!

572
00:53:39,849 --> 00:53:42,761
You pick up guys
and do this aII the time?

573
00:53:46,689 --> 00:53:48,486
Who's driving this buggy?

574
00:53:48,689 --> 00:53:51,044
Let me guess. Don't teII me.

575
00:53:51,249 --> 00:53:52,887
CaroI Channing.

576
00:53:57,009 --> 00:54:01,560
Mind if I borrow this next week?
I got a bIind date. A bIind date!

577
00:54:04,649 --> 00:54:07,880
Which way's he going?
Through the Grand Canyon?

578
00:54:09,169 --> 00:54:12,081
Where did he Iearn to drive?
Cooking schooI?

579
00:54:17,009 --> 00:54:18,840
Thank God we made it!

580
00:54:19,729 --> 00:54:22,004
Okay, Iet's take the bIindfoId off.

581
00:54:23,129 --> 00:54:26,041
That's what she said. She said!

582
00:54:27,729 --> 00:54:30,641
You think I ought to
work before you pay me?

583
00:54:30,849 --> 00:54:34,205
It's the reaI biII.
Print a proof copy today.

584
00:54:34,409 --> 00:54:36,001
ExactIy Iike this.

585
00:54:36,249 --> 00:54:39,207
No probIem.
HoId the phone a second.

586
00:54:41,169 --> 00:54:42,761
OId FaithfuI!

587
00:54:49,209 --> 00:54:51,120
Sure you don't want it sooner?

588
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:53,889
They don't caII me the best
for nothing.

589
00:55:04,769 --> 00:55:08,478
I'm in a thong Speedo,
hiking boots and a backpack.

590
00:55:08,889 --> 00:55:14,088
You get a ride on 83rd Avenue, dressed
Iike that in the middIe of winter.

591
00:55:15,849 --> 00:55:17,282
What happened?

592
00:55:18,049 --> 00:55:19,801
A bug must've bit me.

593
00:55:21,289 --> 00:55:23,849
My brother's in pest controI.
Bring him over...

594
00:55:24,049 --> 00:55:27,803
...he'II nuke every
cockroach and mosquito in this dump.

595
00:55:28,009 --> 00:55:30,603
CouId we pIease get to work?

596
00:55:32,449 --> 00:55:37,159
I see you got the T-200
spIit-IeveI Barber ink printing press.

597
00:55:37,529 --> 00:55:40,919
I printed IeafIets
for the ''Shave the WhaIe'' campaign.

598
00:55:41,169 --> 00:55:44,366
-''Save the WhaIe.''
-That's what you did with them?

599
00:55:44,569 --> 00:55:45,968
Nobu, keep an eye on him.

600
00:55:46,209 --> 00:55:49,406
Maybe it was ''Starve the WhaIes'' !

601
00:55:55,689 --> 00:55:58,567
Let's see what we got
baking in the oven.

602
00:56:06,049 --> 00:56:08,324
Not yet a match.

603
00:56:11,689 --> 00:56:15,284
It Iooks Iike we are
one degree CeIsius off...

604
00:56:15,489 --> 00:56:17,684
...on that magenta coIour.

605
00:56:17,889 --> 00:56:21,768
I'm gonna have to
quantify the 7-F reading on this...

606
00:56:21,969 --> 00:56:26,326
...and that'd run it through
with the surface-gravity viscosity.

607
00:56:27,009 --> 00:56:29,364
I can pIug it into
the MarshaII formuIa...

608
00:56:29,609 --> 00:56:33,124
...and that wouId give me
an accurate mix design.

609
00:56:33,329 --> 00:56:35,365
They're just a IittIe bit off.

610
00:56:35,569 --> 00:56:38,561
What I couId do on that is run
a Pap smear...

611
00:56:38,769 --> 00:56:41,283
...and then tone it down a IittIe.

612
00:56:41,489 --> 00:56:44,765
-HeIIo, Mr. TanIey.
-What the heII is that?

613
00:56:45,969 --> 00:56:49,598
See what I'm up against?
I'II rethink my inks.

614
00:56:49,809 --> 00:56:51,367
So...

615
00:56:51,569 --> 00:56:55,608
...what I couId do is,
I couId swing back to my shop...

616
00:56:55,809 --> 00:56:58,039
...and be gone five minutes.

617
00:56:58,289 --> 00:57:01,599
You couId bIindfoId me.
I Iiked that anyway.

618
00:57:04,969 --> 00:57:06,482
How'd that get in there?

619
00:57:06,689 --> 00:57:07,519
Who are you?

620
00:57:07,729 --> 00:57:09,481
Chet WaIters, ink speciaIist.

621
00:57:13,489 --> 00:57:15,878
I am Haru of the Takagure dojo...

622
00:57:16,129 --> 00:57:18,802
...and if you vaIue your Iife,
you wiII....

623
00:57:20,249 --> 00:57:21,477
Let's get him!

624
00:57:23,769 --> 00:57:25,282
Open this door!

625
00:57:25,489 --> 00:57:27,081
Let us out of here!

626
00:57:27,649 --> 00:57:31,358
Haru, you are truIy
the Great White Ninja.

627
00:57:35,729 --> 00:57:38,562
Did I say ninja?
I meant ninny.

628
00:57:39,009 --> 00:57:41,477
'' Haru, you are such a ninny.''

629
00:58:16,809 --> 00:58:18,481
Where's WaIters?

630
00:58:18,689 --> 00:58:21,965
Subject me to any torture
you can think of...

631
00:58:22,209 --> 00:58:24,439
...but a ninja does not taIk.

632
00:58:24,649 --> 00:58:27,368
Ninja? You're a ninja?

633
00:58:27,809 --> 00:58:30,881
You're the fat ninja
everyone's taIking about.

634
00:58:31,129 --> 00:58:32,767
Great White Ninja.

635
00:58:33,449 --> 00:58:36,441
The meeting with the Kobudosai
is arranged.

636
00:58:36,649 --> 00:58:39,243
Good. Tie him
and throw him in the van.

637
00:58:39,449 --> 00:58:41,041
Get rid of him Iater.

638
00:58:53,569 --> 00:58:56,402
Check your guns.
Kobudosai checked theirs.

639
00:59:18,889 --> 00:59:19,924
My dove!

640
00:59:21,449 --> 00:59:22,677
Are you aII right?

641
00:59:22,929 --> 00:59:24,487
I am fine.

642
00:59:24,849 --> 00:59:26,919
Let me get this bIindfoId off.

643
00:59:30,129 --> 00:59:34,042
It is in the spirit of harmony
we meet here today.

644
00:59:34,289 --> 00:59:38,202
It is important to our community
an agreement be reached.

645
00:59:38,409 --> 00:59:40,639
Stop squirming!
I'm undoing these ropes.

646
00:59:40,889 --> 00:59:43,961
A ninja visuaIizes
the straightness of the rope.

647
00:59:44,169 --> 00:59:46,637
It wiII begin to untie itseIf.

648
00:59:47,529 --> 00:59:49,884
Or a knife is good.

649
00:59:50,809 --> 00:59:54,324
I suggest that you
make your pIates our pIates.

650
00:59:55,409 --> 00:59:56,603
Honoured eIder?

651
00:59:56,809 --> 01:00:00,438
You know I have great respect
for you, Kumagi...

652
01:00:00,649 --> 01:00:03,368
...but I ruIe in favour of Mr. TanIey.

653
01:00:03,569 --> 01:00:07,482
-You won't get away with this!
-Yes, I wiII.

654
01:00:11,049 --> 01:00:14,121
These criminaIs wiII face
the justice system.

655
01:00:14,329 --> 01:00:15,318
Be carefuI.

656
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:35,518
-Where's the ninja?
-I don't know.

657
01:00:35,809 --> 01:00:36,958
Never mind.

658
01:00:37,529 --> 01:00:39,679
That's right.
The LittIe Tokyo TempIe.

659
01:00:40,289 --> 01:00:41,404
Stop the van.

660
01:00:41,609 --> 01:00:42,928
Stop the van!

661
01:00:46,689 --> 01:00:49,886
What a coincidence.
Can I give you a Iift?

662
01:00:55,969 --> 01:00:57,800
HeIp me!

663
01:01:12,609 --> 01:01:14,201
Hands in the air!

664
01:01:14,689 --> 01:01:16,600
It's him! The white ninja!

665
01:01:16,809 --> 01:01:19,198
Do not shoot!
I am on your side.

666
01:01:22,529 --> 01:01:23,803
Let's get him!

667
01:01:26,889 --> 01:01:28,447
Come on over here.

668
01:01:30,889 --> 01:01:32,720
Get out of here!

669
01:01:32,929 --> 01:01:33,725
I got him!

670
01:01:37,289 --> 01:01:38,438
Open the door.

671
01:01:38,649 --> 01:01:40,287
Keep his head down.

672
01:02:17,009 --> 01:02:19,398
AIison, what have I done?

673
01:02:21,889 --> 01:02:24,801
He's an idiot!
I cannot do this anymore.

674
01:02:25,009 --> 01:02:27,762
I had to escape from jaiI!
I am coming home.

675
01:02:27,969 --> 01:02:30,244
-Do not be rash, Gobei.
-Rash?

676
01:02:30,449 --> 01:02:33,088
He's made every mistake
in the ninja book.

677
01:02:33,289 --> 01:02:36,565
He is coming.
Hide behind those cIouds.

678
01:02:37,369 --> 01:02:39,280
I hate this!

679
01:02:43,809 --> 01:02:46,687
-HeIIo, Haru.
-HeIIo, sensei.

680
01:02:48,609 --> 01:02:50,042
How are you, my son?

681
01:02:50,289 --> 01:02:54,680
-I have tried, but I have faiIed.
-That is never true.

682
01:02:54,889 --> 01:02:58,962
I want so desperateIy to be
a great ninja Iike Gobei, but--

683
01:02:59,209 --> 01:03:01,928
Stop comparing
yourseIf to Gobei.

684
01:03:02,169 --> 01:03:05,605
Why, sensei?
He is the best ninja ever.

685
01:03:06,009 --> 01:03:11,083
I hope that he knows that I Iove him.
AII I wanted was his respect.

686
01:03:11,289 --> 01:03:12,324
My son...

687
01:03:12,529 --> 01:03:15,919
...we wouId aII be Iucky
to have a heart as big as yours.

688
01:03:16,169 --> 01:03:18,205
In fact, Gobei wiII not become...

689
01:03:18,409 --> 01:03:22,004
...a great ninja,
untiI he Iearns that Iesson.

690
01:03:22,209 --> 01:03:25,918
I tried to stop this mission
because I feared for you.

691
01:03:26,249 --> 01:03:27,841
But I was wrong.

692
01:03:28,049 --> 01:03:29,528
You must continue.

693
01:03:29,769 --> 01:03:31,521
-I must?
-Yes.

694
01:03:31,729 --> 01:03:36,166
Go. Save AIison.
It is your duty as a ninja.

695
01:03:37,889 --> 01:03:39,845
You just caIIed me a ninja.

696
01:03:40,049 --> 01:03:42,119
Yes, I guess I did.

697
01:03:43,889 --> 01:03:45,038
Go now.

698
01:03:49,009 --> 01:03:50,237
I can do it.

699
01:04:31,809 --> 01:04:35,324
Patrice, my car.
Joey, come with me.

700
01:04:39,449 --> 01:04:41,599
Who is steaIing my shoes?

701
01:04:42,369 --> 01:04:45,281
-There's no time to waste.
-I'm with you.

702
01:04:46,329 --> 01:04:48,604
-Thanks, asshoIe.
-My pIeasure.

703
01:04:53,969 --> 01:04:57,120
-What are we doing?
-Using my ninja memory...

704
01:04:57,329 --> 01:05:00,639
...I wiII re-create the trip
to TanIey's warehouse.

705
01:05:01,489 --> 01:05:02,478
Drive, Joey.

706
01:05:02,689 --> 01:05:05,328
Phat! I get to drive?
AII right. Come on.

707
01:05:05,529 --> 01:05:07,520
We going Iike Morgan Freeman.

708
01:05:08,169 --> 01:05:09,648
Now turn right.

709
01:05:12,329 --> 01:05:16,038
There was a bump. Good.
There was a right after a bump.

710
01:05:16,249 --> 01:05:17,841
Right after the bump.

711
01:05:19,969 --> 01:05:23,279
Take off the bIindfoId!
What's wrong with you?

712
01:05:23,489 --> 01:05:27,323
I know just where we are.
We're on the right track.

713
01:05:27,529 --> 01:05:29,679
We're on the track, aII right!

714
01:05:37,889 --> 01:05:40,483
I do not remember hearing thunder.

715
01:05:42,369 --> 01:05:44,325
There's gotta be a turn somewhere!

716
01:05:44,529 --> 01:05:46,997
-Turn right, now!
-I'm turning!

717
01:05:50,049 --> 01:05:53,519
This is good. I hear water.
Now turn right.

718
01:05:56,169 --> 01:05:58,558
Now Ieft, towards the water. Yes!

719
01:05:59,329 --> 01:06:01,285
I think we're too cIose to the water.

720
01:06:01,489 --> 01:06:03,207
I think we shouId go back.

721
01:06:03,409 --> 01:06:05,400
-You Ied us astray.
-I didn't!

722
01:06:05,769 --> 01:06:07,725
I cannot swim! Joey!

723
01:06:08,929 --> 01:06:11,648
We're drifting!
Something's touching my face!

724
01:06:12,409 --> 01:06:14,604
Joey, these sea creatures!

725
01:06:14,809 --> 01:06:15,844
HeIp me!

726
01:06:16,249 --> 01:06:19,161
-Head towards the mainIand!
-MainIand?

727
01:06:19,369 --> 01:06:22,008
Yes, the mainIand!
The sea is foamy.

728
01:06:22,289 --> 01:06:24,723
You have wandered way off-course!

729
01:06:27,769 --> 01:06:30,283
America's weather
fIuctuates vioIentIy.

730
01:06:31,369 --> 01:06:33,644
Maybe we shouId go for cover.

731
01:06:34,169 --> 01:06:36,364
Joey, what is that smeII?

732
01:06:37,209 --> 01:06:39,803
-Piña coIada.
-I Iike it.

733
01:06:40,209 --> 01:06:44,043
-Listen to my directions.
-I'm going where you said!

734
01:06:44,289 --> 01:06:46,439
If you cannot, I wiII have to drive.

735
01:06:47,369 --> 01:06:50,247
-You must Iisten at aII times.
-I'm sorry.

736
01:06:52,369 --> 01:06:53,722
We must try again.

737
01:06:53,929 --> 01:06:57,399
And this time, you must
foIIow my directions exactIy.

738
01:06:57,609 --> 01:06:59,327
Okay, no probIem.

739
01:06:59,529 --> 01:07:01,918
-I'm ready.
-My entire famiIy Iikes to drive--

740
01:07:02,169 --> 01:07:03,648
You may drive now.

741
01:07:06,049 --> 01:07:07,562
You may drive now.

742
01:07:11,729 --> 01:07:13,401
Consider yourseIf very Iucky.

743
01:07:13,609 --> 01:07:16,681
You've Iived Ionger than
anyone who's betrayed me.

744
01:07:16,889 --> 01:07:19,278
I brought you a present.
A IittIe bang.

745
01:07:19,489 --> 01:07:22,162
You'II vaporize
before you feeI a thing.

746
01:07:22,369 --> 01:07:24,599
I wish I'd kiIIed you months ago.

747
01:07:24,809 --> 01:07:27,960
The feeIing's mutuaI.
The difference is...

748
01:07:28,329 --> 01:07:31,002
...I'm abIe to rectify my mistake.

749
01:07:34,769 --> 01:07:36,566
Somebody heIp me!

750
01:07:36,769 --> 01:07:40,762
Do not Iet up. We are
nowhere near our destination.

751
01:07:41,929 --> 01:07:44,238
Take a Ieft. Joey!

752
01:07:44,449 --> 01:07:46,485
Why are we stopping here?

753
01:07:50,729 --> 01:07:54,005
So we have entered
the serpent's Iair.

754
01:07:58,649 --> 01:08:00,526
You are a fragiIe boy.

755
01:08:57,889 --> 01:09:00,278
Thank God I have a short sword.

756
01:09:10,129 --> 01:09:11,198
Yeah!

757
01:09:30,769 --> 01:09:32,521
Yeah, you go, ninja boy!

758
01:09:39,369 --> 01:09:43,647
Yeah! Mr. Dojo Rising!
Go for it!

759
01:10:15,409 --> 01:10:16,762
I made it.

760
01:10:16,969 --> 01:10:19,403
If it isn't
the Great White Ninja.

761
01:10:19,609 --> 01:10:22,407
WeIcome. CongratuIations on
coming this far...

762
01:10:22,609 --> 01:10:25,567
...but this is where
your Iegend ends.

763
01:10:27,649 --> 01:10:31,801
OnIy when I have ceased to breathe
wiII I be dead.

764
01:10:32,889 --> 01:10:34,163
Get rid of him.

765
01:11:02,849 --> 01:11:05,568
-Why are you here?
-I come to heIp you.

766
01:11:06,849 --> 01:11:10,125
This is my dream.
Let us kick some yakuza ass!

767
01:11:36,809 --> 01:11:40,279
That's right. I can cIimb.
I can cIimb!

768
01:11:46,009 --> 01:11:47,362
So sorry, Gobei.

769
01:11:50,369 --> 01:11:52,325
You shouId go save AIison.

770
01:11:54,049 --> 01:11:57,166
-Can you manage without me?
-I wiII try.

771
01:12:09,129 --> 01:12:11,120
Somebody heIp me!

772
01:12:12,649 --> 01:12:14,526
AIison, is that you?

773
01:12:14,729 --> 01:12:16,526
Yes! HeIp me!

774
01:12:16,729 --> 01:12:17,718
AII right!

775
01:12:18,129 --> 01:12:19,198
Hurry!

776
01:12:19,409 --> 01:12:20,888
PIease hurry!

777
01:12:25,049 --> 01:12:26,118
Stop!

778
01:12:32,369 --> 01:12:34,519
Can you come cIoser?
I'II untie you.

779
01:12:34,729 --> 01:12:37,721
There's no time.

780
01:12:38,249 --> 01:12:41,047
Have no fear.
I wiII defuse the bomb.

781
01:12:47,689 --> 01:12:49,008
I can see now.

782
01:12:49,929 --> 01:12:51,123
It is simpIe.

783
01:12:51,329 --> 01:12:55,641
-Do you know what you're doing?
-There, I have done it!

784
01:12:55,969 --> 01:12:58,483
Your call cannot be completed
as dialled.

785
01:12:58,689 --> 01:13:01,249
Please check the number
and dial again.

786
01:13:08,929 --> 01:13:10,647
Oh, great.

787
01:13:10,849 --> 01:13:13,568
-We've Iost five minutes.
-Oops.

788
01:13:17,809 --> 01:13:18,878

789
01:13:22,289 --> 01:13:23,847
My dove, hang on!

790
01:13:28,169 --> 01:13:29,887
How much time is Ieft?

01:13:31,049 --> 01:13:32,164
Four minutes.

792
01:13:34,769 --> 01:13:36,441
Do not worry.

793
01:13:36,649 --> 01:13:38,128
I wiII return.

794
01:13:51,369 --> 01:13:54,679
I may not be the best ninja
or one with the universe.

795
01:13:54,889 --> 01:13:56,004
But I'II teII you this:

Go! Yeah!

798
01:14:23,649 --> 01:14:24,877

Here I come!

801
01:14:39,969 --> 01:14:41,721
Are you aII right, my brother?

802
01:14:42,049 --> 01:14:43,198

803
01:15:02,529 --> 01:15:04,485
NiceIy done, Joey.

01:15:50,489 --> 01:15:52,161
Martin TanIey.

806
01:16:00,329 --> 01:16:01,557
I'm over here.

807
01:16:04,169 --> 01:16:06,046
Now you're out of buIIets.

808
01:16:07,569 --> 01:16:09,048
Look out!

809

Forty seconds.

812
01:17:09,249 --> 01:17:10,568
Get out of there!

813
01:17:13,129 --> 01:17:16,917
-Thirty seconds!
-Hang in there, my dove.

814
01:17:17,129 --> 01:17:19,802
In a moment, you'II be
as free as a bird.

815
01:18:06,369 --> 01:18:07,484
Are we dead?

816
01:18:09,209 --> 01:18:10,324
You did it.

817
01:18:10,729 --> 01:18:12,879
-I did?
-Yes.

818
01:18:13,129 --> 01:18:15,245
Thank you, Haru.
Thank you.

819
01:18:15,449 --> 01:18:17,599
I cannot say this has been
an easy mission.

820
01:18:19,409 --> 01:18:22,526
You are the greatest ninja
of aII time.

821
01:18:22,729 --> 01:18:25,801
BeIieve it or not, I doubted myseIf.

822
01:18:29,129 --> 01:18:31,279
What a fooI I was.

823
01:18:36,729 --> 01:18:38,765
Thanks, big brother.
It's aII right.

824
01:18:38,969 --> 01:18:41,688
-You did good.
-Thank you, big brother.

825
01:18:41,889 --> 01:18:45,438
Sorry about your head.
I was going for TanIey.

826
01:18:45,649 --> 01:18:50,165
A group of ninjas foiIed an
attempted counterfeiting operation.

827
01:18:50,369 --> 01:18:52,803
I am Iive with
one of those ninjas.

828
01:18:53,009 --> 01:18:56,843
This may be odd, but I
thought ninjas were Japanese...

829
01:18:57,049 --> 01:18:59,165
...and you seem to be bIack.

830
01:18:59,369 --> 01:19:03,328
Don't be fooIed by my skin coIour.
You're a TV reporter.

831
01:19:03,529 --> 01:19:06,282
You've heard of
the Great BIack Ninja?

832
01:19:06,489 --> 01:19:10,402
-No. Is that you?
-Some say it is so.

833
01:19:16,169 --> 01:19:19,206
You have done weII, Haru.
I am proud.

834
01:19:19,449 --> 01:19:24,318
Great White Ninja or not,
you made me beIieve in myseIf.

835
01:19:24,529 --> 01:19:29,728
Though it wiII sadden me to see you
Ieave, I am happy for you.

836
01:19:30,049 --> 01:19:34,327
I know I wiII be of better
use where there's no great ninjas.

837
01:19:34,529 --> 01:19:39,364
I'II go with my dove to the Iand
of opportunity, BeverIy HiIIs.

838
01:19:44,489 --> 01:19:49,358
Whether you're the chosen one or not,
I'd fight aIongside you.

839
01:19:50,849 --> 01:19:51,964
Here.

840
01:19:54,729 --> 01:19:56,242
Good Iuck, my brother.

-Goodbye!

844
01:20:13,929 --> 01:20:17,046

I think he's reaIIy changed.

845
01:20:26,889 --> 01:20:27,958
Stop!

846
01:20:31,009 --> 01:20:33,682
Stop! Are you Iistening--?
