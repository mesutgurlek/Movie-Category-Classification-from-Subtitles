1
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:06,297
MONEY TRAIN

2
00:02:30,386 --> 00:02:33,617
Merry Christmas.

3
00:02:43,066 --> 00:02:46,422
Watch it!

4
00:03:08,386 --> 00:03:11,662
Thank you very much.

5
00:03:23,346 --> 00:03:27,544
We wish you a Merry Christmas ...

6
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:38,825
- Check this dude.
- He looks like the Five-0.

7
00:03:46,146 --> 00:03:49,138
Are you a cop?

8
00:03:49,306 --> 00:03:53,458
He's no Five-0. He's been drinking.

9
00:03:55,106 --> 00:03:58,701
He's checking out the D.

10
00:03:58,866 --> 00:04:05,942
We have two Hispanic males.
Let's see if they end the game.

11
00:04:07,786 --> 00:04:13,383
- This looks familiar.
- He's got a slice. Stay alert.

12
00:04:14,746 --> 00:04:18,261
He's got my ring.

13
00:04:18,426 --> 00:04:21,498
Shit! He's wearing my watch.

14
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:25,978
Nobody go
until you see him pull his lapel.

15
00:04:28,746 --> 00:04:33,024
- Shit!
- Fucking white boy!

16
00:04:41,826 --> 00:04:43,817
Stay!

17
00:04:43,986 --> 00:04:46,500
Get out of my way!

18
00:04:49,066 --> 00:04:53,139
Move!

19
00:04:53,306 --> 00:04:58,175
- Get out of the way!
- Come on, grandma.

20
00:04:59,706 --> 00:05:05,338
- No laying down on the job!
- I'm glad my pain amuses you.

21
00:05:05,506 --> 00:05:07,736
Come on. Move!

22
00:05:09,066 --> 00:05:11,785
T.A.!

23
00:05:19,426 --> 00:05:24,295
Slow down.
You've got cops down there?

24
00:05:24,466 --> 00:05:31,542
All trains north and south of
Wall Street Station stop and stay.

25
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:47,262
- Doesn't he ever sleep?
- Yeah, during the day. In a coffin.

26
00:05:47,426 --> 00:05:53,501
- You're stopping trains. Why?
- We've got cops in the tunnel.

27
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:57,625
- Where is the revenue train?
- At Wall Street.

28
00:05:57,786 --> 00:06:02,257
- Send it through.
- We've got cops on the track.

29
00:06:02,426 --> 00:06:05,099
Nothing stops the money train.

30
00:06:27,466 --> 00:06:30,617
- The money train!
- I've got a new plan.

31
00:06:50,586 --> 00:06:53,180
Get out of my way!

32
00:06:58,906 --> 00:07:03,263
- Here's the cash.
- You sold a lot of tokens today.

33
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:08,265
Watch it!

34
00:07:09,866 --> 00:07:13,654
- Freeze!
- They're not stopping.

35
00:07:26,186 --> 00:07:30,145
- I don't believe this shit!
- We're cops.

36
00:07:30,306 --> 00:07:34,379
- Back up, men.
- Look. it's the Transit Twins.

37
00:07:34,546 --> 00:07:39,495
- Did you have to shoot him?
- He's a fucking kid.

38
00:07:40,986 --> 00:07:46,344
- We're only following orders.
- Does he look like a train robber?

39
00:07:46,506 --> 00:07:49,339
Don't try to hang the blame on us.

40
00:07:49,506 --> 00:07:54,580
- You ran him down the track.
- What did you say?

41
00:07:54,746 --> 00:07:58,295
You're not gonna hit him ...
I'm gonna hit him.

42
00:08:07,826 --> 00:08:10,659
Chief, the detectives are here.

43
00:08:13,906 --> 00:08:17,103
Sit down.

44
00:08:18,346 --> 00:08:23,818
- Don't bleed on my chair.
- No sir. Chief Patterson.

45
00:08:23,986 --> 00:08:30,016
That report says you're brothers.
You are a negro.

46
00:08:30,186 --> 00:08:33,735
He is white.
Is somebody trying to jack me off?

47
00:08:33,906 --> 00:08:39,299
- No. we're foster brothers.
- I ran away from this orphanage ...

48
00:08:39,466 --> 00:08:42,617
Shut up!

49
00:08:44,466 --> 00:08:51,895
Today, you caused my money train
to arrive 46 minutes late.

50
00:08:52,066 --> 00:08:57,663
When my train is late, I take it
as a personal sign of disrespect.

51
00:08:57,826 --> 00:09:03,583
The revenue collection of the entire
subway system is under my command.

52
00:09:03,746 --> 00:09:09,343
My train. My people. My money.

53
00:09:09,506 --> 00:09:15,581
No one dictates the movements
of that train without my permission.

54
00:09:15,746 --> 00:09:21,184
- Am I making myself clear?
- As a bell. sir. Your train.

55
00:09:23,786 --> 00:09:28,496
- Shut up!
- Yes. sir.

56
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:31,260
Now ... any questions?

57
00:09:31,426 --> 00:09:36,784
Why did you send the train through
when you knew we were in the tunnel?

58
00:09:36,946 --> 00:09:41,224
Your situation last night
didn't affect me.

59
00:09:41,386 --> 00:09:45,061
Your men shot that kid to shit
over a rope chain.

60
00:09:45,226 --> 00:09:50,539
Yeah, they shot him to shit ... and
you can't buy publicity like that.

61
00:09:51,546 --> 00:09:54,663
That boy is a goddamn hero.

62
00:09:54,826 --> 00:09:59,456
Thanks to his sacrifice
the word went forth today:

63
00:09:59,626 --> 00:10:04,063
You fuck with my train
and I'll kill you!

64
00:10:04,226 --> 00:10:08,583
Now I'm gonna send one more message:
I don't like you.

65
00:10:08,746 --> 00:10:15,379
So don't fuck with my train again.
If you do, we will tangle ass ...

66
00:10:15,546 --> 00:10:18,856
... and you will lose.

67
00:10:20,306 --> 00:10:22,297
You're dismissed.

68
00:10:24,146 --> 00:10:29,345
I hate bastards like that.
You can't put a price on human life.

69
00:10:29,506 --> 00:10:35,024
- He's worried about his schedule.
- You know what I'd like to do?

70
00:10:35,186 --> 00:10:39,179
- Shoot him?
- No. I'd like to take his train.

71
00:10:39,346 --> 00:10:43,464
- Take the candy from the baby.
- You say the word.

72
00:10:43,626 --> 00:10:45,662
- Word.
- I'm there.

73
00:10:45,826 --> 00:10:49,136
- Let's do it.
- If I didn't have this badge ...

74
00:10:49,306 --> 00:10:52,776
- We're not nuns.
- We're not taking the train.

75
00:10:52,946 --> 00:10:55,983
Too late.

76
00:10:58,906 --> 00:11:05,459
- I sure miss the old neighbourhood.
- You should come back more often.

77
00:11:05,626 --> 00:11:09,904
- Are you coming in?
- No, I've got a date.

78
00:11:10,066 --> 00:11:16,096
With a girl ...
or a deck of cards?

79
00:11:16,266 --> 00:11:22,899
- Do you think I'm gambling again?
- Yeah, I can see it in your eyes.

80
00:11:23,066 --> 00:11:28,140
- You've got a suspicious mind.
- I know you.

81
00:11:28,306 --> 00:11:31,264
Have you got any cash?

82
00:11:31,426 --> 00:11:37,535
- I'm buying your Christmas present.
- With my money?

83
00:11:37,706 --> 00:11:41,335
Yeah, so don't be stingy.

84
00:11:41,506 --> 00:11:48,423
- You never cease to amaze me.
- Don't count it. I trust you.

85
00:11:48,586 --> 00:11:52,374
- Will you really buy me a present?
- I love you.

86
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:56,221
- Then give me my money.
- Where's your Christmas spirit?

87
00:11:56,386 --> 00:11:59,981
In your pocket.

88
00:12:00,146 --> 00:12:03,695
No ties or cologne, all right?

89
00:12:05,146 --> 00:12:10,061
Remember where you are.
You'd better change that walk.

90
00:12:13,746 --> 00:12:16,658
Are you all right, man?

91
00:12:16,826 --> 00:12:16,906
- 1.000.
- I'm in.

92
00:12:16,906 --> 00:12:19,898
- 1.000.
- I'm in.

93
00:12:20,066 --> 00:12:23,945
See the grand
and kick it a grand.

94
00:12:24,106 --> 00:12:27,735
- Not me.
- I'm out.

95
00:12:28,106 --> 00:12:33,100
I'm gonna have to kick it to 5,000.

96
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:38,295
Too rich for me.

97
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:51,060
Charlie ...
are you gonna eat or play cards?

98
00:12:53,186 --> 00:12:57,543
Sorry. I'm making a mess.

99
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:04,984
- I'll call you.
- With what? You're light.

100
00:13:05,146 --> 00:13:13,702
Gentlemen, say hello to Oyster.
Mother-of-pearl.

101
00:13:25,626 --> 00:13:29,062
Charlie, let me get you a parachute.

102
00:13:31,626 --> 00:13:35,539
Your brother better get here soon
or he'll be an only child.

103
00:13:47,946 --> 00:13:54,055
- Okay, nobody move.
- Is that you? My brother?

104
00:13:54,226 --> 00:14:00,256
- Thank God you're here!
- What the hell is going on here?

105
00:14:00,426 --> 00:14:05,705
- You brought the money, right?
- 300 bucks.

106
00:14:05,866 --> 00:14:10,257
- He owes Mr. Brown 15.000.
- 15.000?

107
00:14:10,426 --> 00:14:13,657
This is no time to be cheap.

108
00:14:15,466 --> 00:14:19,857
- Drop him.
- He's kidding.

109
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:25,259
- They don't have a sense of humour.
- I'm tired of this shit.

110
00:14:25,426 --> 00:14:27,701
You're the man.

111
00:14:30,986 --> 00:14:36,265
Okay, let's make a deal.
Here's the 300 bucks.

112
00:14:36,426 --> 00:14:40,419
- The rest, you get in a few days.
- I'll pay you, I swear to God.

113
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:44,624
Okay, reel him in.

114
00:14:44,786 --> 00:14:51,624
You guys are great. I was kidding
about the sense of humour thing.

115
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:59,064
- I thought they were gonna drop me.
- You said you'd stopped this shit.

116
00:14:59,226 --> 00:15:06,462
- I thought I couldn't lose.
- You say the same thing every time.

117
00:15:06,626 --> 00:15:11,256
- I'm tired of saving your ass.
- I'd have got out of that shit.

118
00:15:11,426 --> 00:15:15,817
If I hadn't saved you,
you'd be a chalk outline right now.

119
00:15:15,986 --> 00:15:19,376
I have changed at a basic level.

120
00:15:19,546 --> 00:15:25,894
I was up there. 51 stories.
Dangling. Imminent death.

121
00:15:26,066 --> 00:15:30,662
Suddenly ... it was like
Buddha consciousness.

122
00:15:30,826 --> 00:15:32,817
I've read about it.

123
00:15:32,986 --> 00:15:38,344
God spoke to me. She said,
'You have got to stop gambling."

124
00:15:38,506 --> 00:15:42,419
- I bet $10 you can't do it.
- Make it $20.

125
00:15:42,586 --> 00:15:49,856
- Where's your sense of humour?
- You've been drinking dog piss.

126
00:15:50,026 --> 00:15:52,938
It's good for you.

127
00:16:01,866 --> 00:16:06,986
Let's see that drunk walk again.

128
00:16:13,946 --> 00:16:19,384
Say hello to Grace Santiago.
She's gonna be working with us.

129
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:24,540
- Hi, guys. Nice to meet you.
- How are you doing?

130
00:16:24,706 --> 00:16:27,459
Welcome aboard.

131
00:16:29,626 --> 00:16:33,699
- She is smokin'.
- I think I'm in love.

132
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:57,544
All quiet by the D.

133
00:17:08,866 --> 00:17:12,222
Okay, we've got a Christmas shopper.

134
00:17:12,386 --> 00:17:17,699
A white male. 19.
Dressed all black.

135
00:17:17,866 --> 00:17:20,141
He's interested.

136
00:17:21,866 --> 00:17:27,702
His girlfriend's after him.
She's dragging him away.

137
00:17:27,866 --> 00:17:33,145
- Did you do much decoy?
- Six months in the outer boroughs.

138
00:17:33,306 --> 00:17:36,821
This transfer
was definitely a lucky break.

139
00:17:36,986 --> 00:17:41,582
- They say you guys are the best.
- Modesty prevents me ...

140
00:17:41,746 --> 00:17:45,261
No. it doesn't. We are the best.

141
00:17:46,506 --> 00:17:52,615
His arm's swinging. He looks like
he forgot how to take a whiz.

142
00:17:52,786 --> 00:17:55,983
He got that from me.

143
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:04,105
- Where are you from?
- The Bronx.

144
00:18:04,266 --> 00:18:09,294
- Are you living by yourself?
- Yeah.

145
00:18:09,466 --> 00:18:15,143
- Keep watching the D.
- We've got something going on.

146
00:18:16,186 --> 00:18:20,623
What have we got here?
Look at those big hands.

147
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:30,023
- Let's take him home.
- I'm into it.

148
00:18:30,186 --> 00:18:34,179
Hey, honey,
we're gonna take you home.

149
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:38,134
You want to come home?
You're a fine-looking man.

150
00:18:38,306 --> 00:18:41,935
- Don't fight us.
- Look at that face.

151
00:18:42,106 --> 00:18:44,461
We're gonna love you.

152
00:18:44,626 --> 00:18:50,417
- We're gonna chew you up.
- Come with us.

153
00:18:52,546 --> 00:18:55,504
Shouldn't we break it up?

154
00:18:59,906 --> 00:19:07,381
Hey! That's my man.
Get your hands off my man.

155
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:13,496
- Do you want to get hurt?
- We didn't know he was your man.

156
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:16,134
Get out of here!

157
00:19:19,586 --> 00:19:25,661
- I can't trust you for one minute.
- They were huge.

158
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:29,457
She's beautiful.

159
00:19:30,466 --> 00:19:33,856
Wait right there.

160
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:39,499
What are you looking at?

161
00:19:53,266 --> 00:19:55,257
Alone at last.

162
00:19:55,426 --> 00:19:59,419
- May I help you?
- We can help each other.

163
00:19:59,586 --> 00:20:03,374
- What do you want, sir?
- I want to ask you a question.

164
00:20:06,346 --> 00:20:10,544
Do you know what it's like
to smell your own flesh burning?

165
00:20:16,706 --> 00:20:22,019
Hand out the cash. bitch.
or I'll light you up.

166
00:20:31,946 --> 00:20:37,543
- I gave you the money.
- I'm not in it for the money.

167
00:20:44,746 --> 00:20:48,819
It's the torch! Call the EMS.

168
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:03,745
I'll take the street.

169
00:21:23,146 --> 00:21:25,580
Get down!

170
00:21:31,466 --> 00:21:33,616
Sick bastard!

171
00:21:33,786 --> 00:21:35,981
Police!

172
00:21:36,146 --> 00:21:38,865
Get off me.

173
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:58,701
It's okay.

174
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:11,780
Johnny, Merry Christmas.
What are you drinking?

175
00:22:11,946 --> 00:22:17,384
The usual. Jack. Straight up.

176
00:22:22,986 --> 00:22:28,014
Give me to of those
and give me to beers.

177
00:22:35,826 --> 00:22:42,015
This is a little hard
so you should drink it with ...

178
00:22:43,546 --> 00:22:47,095
... a beer. Obviously ...

179
00:22:47,306 --> 00:22:50,025
... you've been there before.

180
00:22:50,186 --> 00:22:53,701
That's with me, Johnny.

181
00:22:56,266 --> 00:23:02,182
You took a pretty hard one today.
Too bad he got away.

182
00:23:02,346 --> 00:23:05,941
It was his lucky day.
That won't happen twice.

183
00:23:06,106 --> 00:23:12,978
The EMS people say the clerk
is going to be just fine.

184
00:23:13,146 --> 00:23:18,539
That's good to hear.

185
00:23:19,466 --> 00:23:26,941
This job can be hazardous to your
health if you take it too seriously.

186
00:23:27,106 --> 00:23:32,180
- I don't know no other way.
- Me neither.

187
00:23:33,426 --> 00:23:37,101
It takes a special kind of person
to do this job.

188
00:23:37,266 --> 00:23:41,305
- Someone with dedication.
- Perseverance.

189
00:23:41,466 --> 00:23:44,105
- Stamina.
- Strength.

190
00:23:44,266 --> 00:23:48,179
- Courage.
- Cojones.

191
00:23:50,106 --> 00:23:55,339
- Complete and utter stupidity.
- It's a curse.

192
00:23:59,426 --> 00:24:03,544
- Welcome to the team.
- Thanks.

193
00:24:04,426 --> 00:24:09,500
- How are my to favourite people?
- We were fine.

194
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:11,657
He's a kidder.

195
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:18,345
I looked long and hard and I found
you something for your first day.

196
00:24:18,506 --> 00:24:21,862
- The alcohol preserves it.
- Thanks.

197
00:24:22,026 --> 00:24:26,895
He probably stole it
from a girl scout.

198
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:30,103
Grab us a couple of cervezas.

199
00:24:30,266 --> 00:24:35,863
You don't expect Grace to pay,
and I'm having a cash-flow problem.

200
00:24:36,026 --> 00:24:40,099
You mean you're broke!

201
00:24:40,266 --> 00:24:45,135
You ain't got a dime to your name.
I love the flower.

202
00:24:45,306 --> 00:24:49,140
Great guy ... too bad he's gay.

203
00:24:49,306 --> 00:24:52,696
- How are you doing?
- Good. man.

204
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:59,942
How does it feel
to be brothers with a white guy?

205
00:25:00,106 --> 00:25:04,622
I told you that story.
I heard a garbage can making noises.

206
00:25:04,786 --> 00:25:06,936
You found him?

207
00:25:07,106 --> 00:25:14,820
Did you feed him? You can't
get rid of them when you feed them.

208
00:25:14,986 --> 00:25:17,898
- Stay black.
- I ain't got no choice.

209
00:25:18,066 --> 00:25:22,264
- The night is young.
- I've got to go.

210
00:25:22,426 --> 00:25:27,659
- The night's a puppy.
- She's leaving.

211
00:25:35,546 --> 00:25:40,540
- I'm in love.
- You ain't got a shot.

212
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:44,585
- I am deeply in love.
- She is nice.

213
00:25:44,746 --> 00:25:52,255
I'd introduce her to Ma Di
if she was still alive.

214
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:59,499
You know what they say:
May the best man win.

215
00:25:59,666 --> 00:26:05,377
- I intend to.
- You're dreaming.

216
00:26:05,546 --> 00:26:08,663
You ain't even got a chance.

217
00:26:08,826 --> 00:26:14,458
She didn't even keep the rose
you gave her.

218
00:26:15,946 --> 00:26:17,937
That's fucked up!

219
00:26:19,106 --> 00:26:25,944
- You can buy her a new one.
- I wouldn't do that to you.

220
00:26:26,106 --> 00:26:30,861
It's typical of your insensitivity,
like pissing on that car.

221
00:26:31,026 --> 00:26:36,146
You've always got to be the coolest.
You've always got to be on top.

222
00:26:36,306 --> 00:26:41,221
- I'm just kidding.
- You're always that way.

223
00:26:41,386 --> 00:26:47,985
- Ma Di gave you everything.
- Ma Di treated us the same.

224
00:26:48,146 --> 00:26:52,059
No. She treated me great.

225
00:26:52,226 --> 00:26:56,777
She took me in. she loved me.
but she loved you better.

226
00:26:56,946 --> 00:27:03,294
We got the same thing, Charlie.
It's called sharing.

227
00:27:03,466 --> 00:27:10,497
- I get your coat, you get my shoes.
- I'm always in your shoes.

228
00:27:10,666 --> 00:27:13,942
I'm always Hook's little brother.

229
00:27:14,106 --> 00:27:22,741
- Is this about shoes or Grace?
- My ceiling is always your floor.

230
00:27:22,906 --> 00:27:27,661
- Then move out of the building.
- I like the building.

231
00:27:27,826 --> 00:27:32,581
But you're always first
and I'm always one step behind.

232
00:27:32,746 --> 00:27:38,025
- So now it's my fault?
- Yeah, partially.

233
00:27:38,186 --> 00:27:45,137
- It's you who always fucks it up.
- Now you're calling me a fuckup.

234
00:27:45,306 --> 00:27:51,984
- I didn't say that.
- It's the same fucking thing.

235
00:27:52,146 --> 00:27:56,025
- Are you listening to me?
- I don't need this shit.

236
00:27:56,186 --> 00:27:59,861
- Get your hands off me.
- Or what?

237
00:28:00,026 --> 00:28:04,497
- I'm here, you're there ...
- Make a move. man.

238
00:28:04,666 --> 00:28:08,056
You want to try me?

239
00:28:08,226 --> 00:28:10,820
Wallets, rings and watches.

240
00:28:10,986 --> 00:28:14,615
- Give up your shit.
- Are you deaf?

241
00:28:14,786 --> 00:28:20,338
- I'm talking to you.
- You heard the man.

242
00:28:25,986 --> 00:28:31,140
- Chill out, white boy.
- Now look at the shit we're in.

243
00:28:32,026 --> 00:28:35,382
- Are you gonna blame this on me?
- Definitely.

244
00:28:35,546 --> 00:28:39,858
Who was watching the street?
My back was to the street.

245
00:28:40,026 --> 00:28:43,655
- I'm sick of you.
- Stop pinning everything on me.

246
00:28:43,826 --> 00:28:46,101
Give it up!

247
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:49,497
- You called me a fuckup.
- I did not!

248
00:28:49,666 --> 00:28:53,181
- Fuck you, man!
- Fuck me? Fuck you!

249
00:28:53,346 --> 00:28:56,861
I'm robbing your ass!
Give up your shit!

250
00:28:57,026 --> 00:29:00,018
I'll get you his shoes.

251
00:29:01,546 --> 00:29:03,343
I'll shoot you.

252
00:29:03,506 --> 00:29:05,781
This is a stick-up!

253
00:29:05,946 --> 00:29:09,018
I'll shoot you full of holes.

254
00:29:09,186 --> 00:29:12,735
What the fuck is wrong with you?

255
00:29:12,906 --> 00:29:17,104
- You took my Ice Cream records.
- Ice Cube!

256
00:29:17,266 --> 00:29:19,826
They're sick!

257
00:29:27,306 --> 00:29:32,061
- Would you really shoot me?
- Hell. no.

258
00:29:32,226 --> 00:29:34,820
You had that Alabama look.

259
00:29:34,986 --> 00:29:39,537
You're lucky
I didn't have a fire hose.

260
00:29:39,706 --> 00:29:46,464
- You think this girl could be it?
- Yeah. I do.

261
00:29:46,626 --> 00:29:51,336
- Hey, go for it.
- Yeah?

262
00:29:51,506 --> 00:29:56,500
- I'm out of it.
- Are you serious?

263
00:29:56,666 --> 00:30:00,341
I hope she makes you happy.

264
00:30:01,346 --> 00:30:06,181
- Merry Christmas, man.
- Merry Christmas to you, too.

265
00:30:20,266 --> 00:30:25,898
The department says we must have
backup in the Christmas season.

266
00:30:26,066 --> 00:30:29,342
Shut up and stay out of our way.

267
00:30:29,506 --> 00:30:33,784
We didn't ask for this assignment.

268
00:30:33,946 --> 00:30:37,222
We're not here to steal anything.

269
00:30:37,386 --> 00:30:42,744
They're pissed off because we
beat up their buddies on day shift.

270
00:30:43,866 --> 00:30:48,496
Everybody chill.
We're here to help you out.

271
00:30:48,666 --> 00:30:54,901
There's just a Little bit too much
testosterone in here.

272
00:30:55,066 --> 00:30:59,856
Back to your stations.
We've got a schedule to keep.

273
00:31:00,026 --> 00:31:02,415
Dooley ...

274
00:31:02,586 --> 00:31:07,262
- You gonna take in a lot tonight?
- Yeah. three or four million.

275
00:31:10,906 --> 00:31:16,936
- That's money.
- Stop drooling.

276
00:31:17,106 --> 00:31:22,464
Just taking a few mental notes.
Check out that grate.

277
00:31:24,906 --> 00:31:29,297
Look alive.
We've got something up ahead.

278
00:31:33,626 --> 00:31:36,424
Just tunnel workers.

279
00:31:36,586 --> 00:31:41,819
- You're in my place.
- Stop poking me with that thing.

280
00:31:41,986 --> 00:31:46,298
- Shut the fuck up!
- Stop pushing me.

281
00:31:50,906 --> 00:31:55,104
You ain't gonna hit him ...
I'm gonna hit him.

282
00:32:03,306 --> 00:32:06,184
Beautiful!

283
00:32:08,306 --> 00:32:11,742
- Is she your wife?
- No. sir.

284
00:32:11,906 --> 00:32:15,785
- Your girlfriend?
- No. sir.

285
00:32:15,946 --> 00:32:21,384
Perhaps your sister?
That would make sense.

286
00:32:21,546 --> 00:32:24,140
A white brother. a black brother ...

287
00:32:24,306 --> 00:32:28,060
... and a Latino sister.

288
00:32:29,666 --> 00:32:35,423
- Officer Grace Santiago, sir.
- You boys are lucky.

289
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:39,374
How did you get so lucky?

290
00:32:39,546 --> 00:32:44,779
Are they lucky, Officer Santiago?

291
00:32:44,946 --> 00:32:51,704
- I don't know what you mean, sir.
- Having you as a partner.

292
00:32:53,786 --> 00:32:59,702
- I'll try my best to do my job.
- I'm sure. You're dismissed.

293
00:33:01,066 --> 00:33:05,582
This doesn't concern you,
Officer Santiago.

294
00:33:06,346 --> 00:33:09,736
You boys, you don't listen.

295
00:33:10,626 --> 00:33:14,778
This time you may have your nuts
in a wringer.

296
00:33:14,946 --> 00:33:21,704
The first time my train
was only late, this time it's light.

297
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:25,256
- Light?
- Sit down.

298
00:33:26,746 --> 00:33:33,265
It seems that in the darkness
somebody made off with $25,000.

299
00:33:33,426 --> 00:33:40,138
- How could that happen?
- Why ask us?

300
00:33:40,306 --> 00:33:43,582
You're a bad gambler.

301
00:33:43,746 --> 00:33:48,695
You're in debt up to your eyeballs.
You're good at losing money.

302
00:33:48,866 --> 00:33:54,498
- How do you think I lost mine?
- Do you think we're behind this?

303
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:59,217
Did I say that?

304
00:33:59,386 --> 00:34:05,018
All I said was that bad things
seem to happen around you to.

305
00:34:05,186 --> 00:34:10,704
Some money got ... lost.
I think you can help me find it.

306
00:34:11,746 --> 00:34:15,455
- How so?
- You look for it.

307
00:34:15,626 --> 00:34:20,939
If you dig down in that commode
that you call a soul, -

308
00:34:21,106 --> 00:34:24,416
- you'll come up with something.

309
00:34:24,586 --> 00:34:28,738
- I didn't ask to be disturbed.
- You might want to hear this.

310
00:34:38,026 --> 00:34:40,142
Get out of here.

311
00:34:47,826 --> 00:34:50,056
You're dismissed.

312
00:34:50,226 --> 00:34:54,185
- Dismissed?
- Dismissed.

313
00:34:58,066 --> 00:35:03,504
One second you're calling us crooks,
the next we're just dismissed.

314
00:35:03,666 --> 00:35:10,139
The money has been recovered.
A collection agent confessed.

315
00:35:15,026 --> 00:35:19,861
What happened to that money train
model that was on your desk?

316
00:35:20,026 --> 00:35:24,463
Yeah. when I didn't see it.
I was heartbroken.

317
00:35:24,626 --> 00:35:29,575
- It's just gone.
- I bet it took ages to make.

318
00:35:29,746 --> 00:35:34,695
You're a wreck
looking for someplace to happen.

319
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:39,257
I'll be there ...
and I'll fuck you dead.

320
00:35:40,386 --> 00:35:45,380
- Does he want to fuck us to death?
- When we're dead. he'll fuck us.

321
00:35:45,546 --> 00:35:49,698
Either way, it's a pain in the ass.

322
00:35:49,866 --> 00:35:54,986
Fuck him. Thinking I stole
the money. That's insulting.

323
00:35:55,146 --> 00:36:01,699
- I thought you stole it, too.
- You did?

324
00:36:01,866 --> 00:36:06,860
That's all right, you're family.
That son of a bitch ...

325
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:11,219
What?

326
00:36:11,386 --> 00:36:14,344
- Look over there.
- It's Wollman Rink.

327
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:19,978
Last night, those repair guys
came up a ladder into the park.

328
00:36:23,946 --> 00:36:28,622
I see what you're saying.
Stop the train near the rink.

329
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:32,745
Use the ladder to climb up
and take away the cash.

330
00:36:32,906 --> 00:36:39,823
- We disappear into the park.
- It'll never work.

331
00:36:39,986 --> 00:36:44,264
How much do you think we can get?

332
00:36:44,426 --> 00:36:48,214
Three or four million. at least.

333
00:36:50,706 --> 00:36:57,179
- We could be rich.
- Free. And our people deserve it.

334
00:36:57,346 --> 00:37:01,942
- Say it loud.
- I'm black and I'm proud.

335
00:37:02,666 --> 00:37:06,978
We're talking
"Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous".

336
00:37:07,146 --> 00:37:12,061
- We could take cruise ships.
- Island to island.

337
00:37:12,226 --> 00:37:17,744
We'd be like boat people, but rich.
We could just buy an island.

338
00:37:17,906 --> 00:37:21,501
Now you're talking.
We could buy Mali.

339
00:37:21,666 --> 00:37:25,022
- Or Bali.
- Tahiti.

340
00:37:25,186 --> 00:37:32,217
We wouldn't have to put up
with any more crap from Patterson.

341
00:37:32,386 --> 00:37:36,220
- We don't deserve that.
- Let the sharks eat him.

342
00:37:36,386 --> 00:37:40,982
- Let's do it.
- Here's what I'm saying ...

343
00:37:41,146 --> 00:37:43,216
Talk to me.

344
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:49,780
The best possible time
to pull this off is New Year's Eve.

345
00:37:49,946 --> 00:37:56,135
It'll be loaded with currency.
It'll just be fat!

346
00:37:56,306 --> 00:38:02,415
- Where did you learn that word?
- MTV Raps. It's my heritage.

347
00:38:02,586 --> 00:38:05,862
What do you think?

348
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:11,737
Charlie. come back to earth.

349
00:38:11,906 --> 00:38:16,184
- Calm down.
- What are you talking about?

350
00:38:16,346 --> 00:38:20,783
- We're not going to rob the train.
- Why not?

351
00:38:20,946 --> 00:38:27,419
We're cops ... "Serve, protect,
break a mother's neck."

352
00:38:27,586 --> 00:38:31,704
- We can do this.
- No ...

353
00:38:33,226 --> 00:38:35,820
It would be no problem.

354
00:38:35,986 --> 00:38:40,184
I'm telling you. It's easy.

355
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:48,945
Put that away before somebody thinks
you got it for Christmas.

356
00:39:16,226 --> 00:39:20,936
- Don't let me interrupt.
- It was too hot inside.

357
00:39:22,746 --> 00:39:26,216
So you're getting down. Salsa.

358
00:39:26,386 --> 00:39:34,782
I love this. I grew up with this.
I'm from the Bronx.

359
00:39:36,226 --> 00:39:39,662
Let's see what you've got.

360
00:39:43,826 --> 00:39:46,818
I'm very surprised.

361
00:39:47,346 --> 00:39:50,622
E Street.

362
00:39:50,786 --> 00:39:54,984
- See that?
- You're teaching me something now.

363
00:39:55,146 --> 00:39:58,343
You've got to learn from somebody.

364
00:39:59,746 --> 00:40:04,342
Watch out now.
I might throw a spin on you.

365
00:40:08,266 --> 00:40:13,659
- It's rough the first time.
- We need to get some practice in.

366
00:40:13,826 --> 00:40:16,704
- We were dancing.
- That was nice.

367
00:40:16,866 --> 00:40:22,463
- Don't just leave me hanging.
- Slow music? No ...

368
00:40:22,626 --> 00:40:27,256
- I don't dance to slow music.
- Don't you like slow music?

369
00:40:27,426 --> 00:40:32,216
How would it look for me
to step up to you like that ...

370
00:40:32,386 --> 00:40:37,699
... and start dancing with you close
and stuff like that?

371
00:40:37,866 --> 00:40:41,256
That could work.

372
00:40:46,266 --> 00:40:50,703
- I've got a confession to make?
- What's that?

373
00:40:50,866 --> 00:40:55,735
This is the first time
I ever danced with a cop.

374
00:40:55,906 --> 00:40:58,943
Me. too.

375
00:41:04,626 --> 00:41:09,461
- I hope that's your gun.
- Yeah, it's poking me, too.

376
00:41:09,626 --> 00:41:12,186
Maybe it's my gun.

377
00:41:12,346 --> 00:41:18,262
- Put your stuff in the back.
- Put your stuff in the back.

378
00:41:58,586 --> 00:42:02,579
I think I should go in.

379
00:42:02,746 --> 00:42:07,866
- We don't want people talking.
- We wouldn't want that.

380
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:11,302
You know how the precinct is.

381
00:42:11,466 --> 00:42:14,139
You go ahead.

382
00:42:15,746 --> 00:42:18,897
Good night.

383
00:42:21,146 --> 00:42:24,024
Grace ...

384
00:42:24,186 --> 00:42:30,500
- I enjoyed dancing with you.
- I enjoyed it, too.

385
00:42:51,506 --> 00:42:56,580
How goes?

386
00:42:56,746 --> 00:42:59,863
A pina colada?

387
00:43:13,226 --> 00:43:17,014
You've got to get up
you've got to get up in the morning .

388
00:43:19,786 --> 00:43:23,904
I knew I shouldn't have told you
where I hide my keys.

389
00:43:24,066 --> 00:43:27,615
Get up. Time to play.

390
00:43:28,866 --> 00:43:33,223
Say no more, man.
It's hot in here.

391
00:43:33,386 --> 00:43:38,665
- It's like a sauna.
- Don't touch the window.

392
00:43:38,826 --> 00:43:41,818
- Fresh air.
- It's cold outside.

393
00:43:41,986 --> 00:43:45,979
- You've got to get fresh air.
- You're not in the Alps.

394
00:43:46,146 --> 00:43:51,743
- It's good for your lungs.
- Not in New York.

395
00:43:54,626 --> 00:44:00,781
You smell like you haven't been
back to your place to wash.

396
00:44:00,946 --> 00:44:04,256
- I've been out.
- Grace?

397
00:44:04,426 --> 00:44:09,216
I've been out with Grace all night,
and God, I'm feeling good.

398
00:44:17,026 --> 00:44:20,063
All night?

399
00:44:21,386 --> 00:44:24,696
All night, and I feel all right.

400
00:44:24,866 --> 00:44:28,415
Did you try some of your
cheap-ass moves?

401
00:44:28,586 --> 00:44:33,660
- A gentleman never tells.
- What?

402
00:44:33,826 --> 00:44:36,624
A gentleman never tells.

403
00:44:36,786 --> 00:44:44,579
Then you can go ahead and tell me.
How did it go?

404
00:44:46,746 --> 00:44:49,465
We ... I ain't gonna say.

405
00:44:50,946 --> 00:44:55,019
Did you kiss her?

406
00:44:58,306 --> 00:45:00,866
You kissed her.

407
00:45:36,506 --> 00:45:42,456
- Shouldn't you be home in bed?
- Too much energy.

408
00:45:43,546 --> 00:45:48,620
I thought
you worked that out last night.

409
00:45:51,306 --> 00:45:54,901
I've still got
a little something left.

410
00:45:59,266 --> 00:46:02,895
- You want to go at it?
- What? Boxing?

411
00:46:03,066 --> 00:46:07,423
Come on, let's go a few rounds.

412
00:46:07,586 --> 00:46:10,054
Don't hold back.

413
00:46:11,706 --> 00:46:14,778
Are you sure you want to do this?

414
00:46:19,906 --> 00:46:22,659
Sneaky!

415
00:46:22,826 --> 00:46:25,863
Get out of here.

416
00:46:26,506 --> 00:46:29,578
I ain't going nowhere.

417
00:46:38,826 --> 00:46:42,182
Okay ... good.

418
00:46:43,066 --> 00:46:48,777
- You want to talk about last night?
- You mean about you and Charlie?

419
00:46:48,946 --> 00:46:53,303
About you and me,
and the reason you backed off.

420
00:46:53,466 --> 00:46:56,902
Are you gonna box or talk?

421
00:47:01,306 --> 00:47:05,857
- It's Charlie. isn't it?
- Yes!

422
00:47:06,026 --> 00:47:11,259
- The guy's crazy about you.
- This has got to be a first.

423
00:47:11,426 --> 00:47:16,136
You care more about your brother
than you do about yourself.

424
00:47:16,346 --> 00:47:19,656
He is my brother.

425
00:47:19,826 --> 00:47:22,784
Yes. I care about him.

426
00:47:22,946 --> 00:47:25,540
I ain't no saint.

427
00:47:25,706 --> 00:47:29,381
There are times
I could kill the guy.

428
00:47:29,546 --> 00:47:33,061
- I heard he's kind of a fuckup.
- Fuckup?

429
00:47:37,346 --> 00:47:40,782
- I'm sorry.
- I'm okay.

430
00:47:40,946 --> 00:47:44,700
- I was out of line.
- No.

431
00:47:44,866 --> 00:47:51,465
- I have to look after my brother.
- I understand about your brother.

432
00:47:51,626 --> 00:47:56,222
I don't understand what's going on
between you and me.

433
00:47:56,386 --> 00:47:59,105
You and me ...

434
00:47:59,546 --> 00:48:03,858
Yeah.
You and your feelings about me.

435
00:48:07,626 --> 00:48:10,538
Well, I decked you, didn't l?

436
00:48:21,546 --> 00:48:26,939
- I feel the same way about you.
- This could get painful.

437
00:48:27,986 --> 00:48:31,342
Hey, love hurts.

438
00:48:34,026 --> 00:48:36,494
Adios.

439
00:48:39,226 --> 00:48:42,263
Charlie, I want to talk to you.

440
00:48:44,066 --> 00:48:46,864
Come here. man.

441
00:48:47,266 --> 00:48:53,705
- I want to give you this.
- You got me a Christmas present.

442
00:48:59,506 --> 00:49:05,536
- What is this? 15 grand?
- I've been saving for a rainy day.

443
00:49:05,706 --> 00:49:10,461
- It's raining, Charlie.
- I can't take this.

444
00:49:10,626 --> 00:49:18,021
Take it. Handle your affairs.
Go ahead and pay Mr. Brown.

445
00:49:18,986 --> 00:49:23,264
- You're always there for me, Hook.
- You'd be there for me.

446
00:49:23,426 --> 00:49:28,625
No. I wouldn't. You wouldn't
get yourself into a mess like this.

447
00:49:32,826 --> 00:49:36,978
- I'll pay you back every dime.
- I know you will.

448
00:49:37,146 --> 00:49:39,057
I love you, man.

449
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:43,504
- Handle it.
- I'll do it right now.

450
00:49:46,506 --> 00:49:50,135
I'd better put this shit away.

451
00:49:50,306 --> 00:49:56,097
Meet me tomorrow night.
I want to talk to you.

452
00:49:56,266 --> 00:49:59,941
You got it.

453
00:50:02,146 --> 00:50:07,015
You never cease to amaze me.
My best New Year's ever.

454
00:50:07,186 --> 00:50:11,304
Or something.

455
00:50:23,986 --> 00:50:27,456
- Are you all right?
- Yes. I'm fine.

456
00:50:27,626 --> 00:50:31,062
Easy does it.

457
00:50:42,106 --> 00:50:45,496
Thank you.

458
00:50:48,426 --> 00:50:49,745
Police!

459
00:50:49,906 --> 00:50:53,455
- Get off of me!
- Settle down.

460
00:50:55,266 --> 00:50:59,225
- Does this look familiar?
- That's my wallet.

461
00:50:59,386 --> 00:51:02,025
I see this all the time.

462
00:51:02,186 --> 00:51:07,624
The best place to keep
your valuables is right here ...

463
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:20,696
No! Open the door!
Stop the train!

464
00:51:40,306 --> 00:51:43,343
Hi.

465
00:51:45,626 --> 00:51:49,016
Round to.

466
00:52:09,706 --> 00:52:14,063
I know you won't believe this,
but I had Mr. Brown's money.

467
00:52:14,226 --> 00:52:18,663
Some old lady dipped me.

468
00:52:18,826 --> 00:52:22,455
Dip this!

469
00:53:37,106 --> 00:53:40,337
God ...

470
00:54:51,666 --> 00:54:55,102
Charlie, at least let me explain ...

471
00:54:55,266 --> 00:55:01,262
There is nothing to explain.
I knew what was going on.

472
00:55:01,426 --> 00:55:05,624
- You're lying.
- If I'm lying, I'm flying.

473
00:55:05,786 --> 00:55:10,018
I'm happy for you guys.
Why wouldn't I be?

474
00:55:10,186 --> 00:55:14,020
We're brothers, right?

475
00:55:18,266 --> 00:55:21,576
Did you pay Mr. Brown?

476
00:55:21,746 --> 00:55:28,857
Actually, I lost the money,
but what else is new, right?

477
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:37,061
Damn. Charlie!

478
00:55:52,146 --> 00:55:55,138
Two tokens, please.

479
00:56:04,786 --> 00:56:09,018
What are the chances of the robbers
actually hitting my booth?

480
00:56:09,186 --> 00:56:15,705
The report says it's only one guy
and that he goes for female clerks.

481
00:56:15,866 --> 00:56:19,575
So ... act female.

482
00:56:19,746 --> 00:56:23,580
What? Powder my nose?
Paint my toenails?

483
00:56:32,466 --> 00:56:37,062
Skip said you'd be a little late.

484
00:56:37,226 --> 00:56:42,141
- Are you all right?
- Yeah ... I'm fine.

485
00:56:43,586 --> 00:56:49,695
I was reading that book
you lent me. "The Kabbalian."

486
00:56:49,866 --> 00:56:54,781
It says that the universe
is a mental creation of the All.

487
00:56:54,946 --> 00:56:58,575
- You're drunk.
- No. I'm not drunk.

488
00:56:58,746 --> 00:57:04,025
- Your breath's about 90-proof.
- That's from last night.

489
00:57:04,186 --> 00:57:11,058
I don't want to hear it.
Go home and get some rest.

490
00:57:11,226 --> 00:57:15,219
You've got a lot of nerve
coming in here like this.

491
00:57:48,626 --> 00:57:53,939
- Let me explain about the money.
- What is it this time? Horses?

492
00:57:54,106 --> 00:57:59,464
No. I was on the train
and this old lady dipped me.

493
00:57:59,626 --> 00:58:04,222
- Don't lie to me!
- Have I ever lied to you?

494
00:58:04,386 --> 00:58:08,299
- Maybe about little things.
- A lie is a lie.

495
00:58:08,466 --> 00:58:14,701
- I want you to believe me.
- I don't. Don't say another word.

496
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:18,336
Are you gonna hit me?

497
00:58:50,306 --> 00:58:57,257
- What the hell was that, Darryl?
- Somebody fell on the track.

498
00:58:57,426 --> 00:59:01,783
Grace, hold your position.
Somebody fell on the tracks.

499
00:59:01,946 --> 00:59:06,940
- Keep your eye on Grace.
- Yeah. I can handle that.

500
00:59:09,946 --> 00:59:14,258
- Who's handling dispatch?
- I don't know.

501
00:59:20,986 --> 00:59:23,784
What happened?

502
00:59:46,386 --> 00:59:50,425
- What the fuck ...
- You remember me?

503
00:59:50,586 --> 00:59:53,703
Sure you do.

504
00:59:54,386 --> 00:59:57,184
That's my scent you're wearing.

505
01:00:04,906 --> 01:00:11,015
- Do you want the money?
- No, I don't want the money.

506
01:00:17,826 --> 01:00:20,186
10-13! Grace is in trouble!

507
01:00:20,186 --> 01:00:21,539
10-13! Grace is in trouble!

508
01:00:21,706 --> 01:00:25,062
Freeze!

509
01:00:39,306 --> 01:00:41,740
Come on!

510
01:00:46,746 --> 01:00:50,580
Police! Move!

511
01:01:09,866 --> 01:01:13,336
Police! Move!

512
01:01:23,266 --> 01:01:26,144
Out of the way!

513
01:01:28,226 --> 01:01:31,855
Move. Police. Out of the way.

514
01:01:40,306 --> 01:01:43,139
No. Charlie!

515
01:02:10,986 --> 01:02:12,977
Move! Get out of the way.

516
01:02:14,786 --> 01:02:17,141
Move! Police!

517
01:03:02,786 --> 01:03:07,382
You see what happens
when you play with fire?

518
01:03:08,626 --> 01:03:11,823
You get burned.

519
01:04:02,026 --> 01:04:05,098
Perfect.

520
01:04:05,266 --> 01:04:08,576
You created quite a shit storm.

521
01:04:08,746 --> 01:04:14,742
You could've blown people away
with your reckless shit.

522
01:04:14,906 --> 01:04:20,299
Now, if you want to look
like a hero, I think I can help.

523
01:04:20,466 --> 01:04:24,982
Don't worry, kid,
we'll get you out of this one.

524
01:04:25,146 --> 01:04:27,979
All you've got to do ...

525
01:04:28,146 --> 01:04:31,695
... is ask for my help.

526
01:04:34,866 --> 01:04:39,223
It's your badge. It's your life.

527
01:04:39,386 --> 01:04:42,139
It's your call.

528
01:04:42,306 --> 01:04:45,343
What do you say?

529
01:04:48,946 --> 01:04:50,982
No.

530
01:04:52,066 --> 01:04:54,739
From there.

531
01:04:54,906 --> 01:04:57,978
Why aren't you laughing?

532
01:04:58,146 --> 01:05:01,695
Don't you think I'm funny any more?

533
01:05:01,866 --> 01:05:06,986
- Now, say it.
- You want to hear the words?

534
01:05:07,146 --> 01:05:11,185
I want to hear the words.

535
01:05:12,706 --> 01:05:19,259
- Kiss my fucking ass.
- You kiss it. You're fired!

536
01:05:19,426 --> 01:05:24,705
Get up, Charlie.
We can work this out.

537
01:05:24,866 --> 01:05:30,975
- Not with this piece of shit.
- Your brother ain't a cop no more.

538
01:05:31,146 --> 01:05:35,583
- Let me talk to him.
- What do you want to help him for?

539
01:05:35,746 --> 01:05:39,659
Everybody knows
your brother is a fuckup.

540
01:05:39,826 --> 01:05:43,580
- A what?
- A fuckup.

541
01:05:43,746 --> 01:05:48,137
I don't have to take this shit.
I'll bust your ass!

542
01:05:48,306 --> 01:05:53,141
Go ahead. take a bite of me.
You'll never get rid of the taste.

543
01:05:53,306 --> 01:05:57,458
- You son of a bitch!
- That's it! You're busted!

544
01:05:57,626 --> 01:06:00,663
I don't have to take this shit!

545
01:06:00,826 --> 01:06:07,061
When your friend calms down,
tell him his badge belongs to me.

546
01:06:07,226 --> 01:06:13,574
I'll send a uniformed officer around
to pick up my hardware.

547
01:06:13,746 --> 01:06:19,503
You don't have to send nobody.
You can come and get it yourself.

548
01:06:19,666 --> 01:06:23,022
This is between you and me,
not you and him.

549
01:06:23,186 --> 01:06:28,385
Who does he think he is? Fuck him!
He's gonna regret this day.

550
01:06:28,546 --> 01:06:32,061
No, fuck you, Charlie.

551
01:06:33,466 --> 01:06:36,742
- Fuck me?
- Yeah, fuck you.

552
01:06:36,906 --> 01:06:42,219
I didn't ask you to step in ...
but it'll work out, don't worry.

553
01:06:42,386 --> 01:06:47,858
No, it's not gonna work out.
Not this time.

554
01:06:48,026 --> 01:06:51,655
- Come back. bro.
- We're not brothers.

555
01:06:51,826 --> 01:06:54,898
We have nothing in common.

556
01:06:55,066 --> 01:06:59,264
I've always been carrying you
on my back.

557
01:06:59,426 --> 01:07:06,662
Am I gonna give up my career
for you? No! Get out of my life!

558
01:07:22,866 --> 01:07:29,180
Frank, do you happen to know
why blind people don't skydive?

559
01:07:30,266 --> 01:07:32,700
No, why?

560
01:07:32,866 --> 01:07:35,824
It scares their dogs.

561
01:07:39,186 --> 01:07:45,375
It scares their ...
You're a tough crowd, Frank.

562
01:07:45,546 --> 01:07:48,265
Another Jagermeister.

563
01:07:48,426 --> 01:07:52,544
You've had enough, Charlie.
You're cut off.

564
01:07:54,986 --> 01:07:58,217
What's your problem?

565
01:07:58,386 --> 01:08:03,062
You're interfering with me
at the embryo stage of a bender.

566
01:08:03,226 --> 01:08:07,663
Other than that
I've got nothing to worry about.

567
01:08:07,826 --> 01:08:13,537
I've got no job, no brother,
no girlfriend, no future ...

568
01:08:13,706 --> 01:08:19,702
I've got nothing to lose. For the
first time in my life ... I'm free.

569
01:08:19,866 --> 01:08:25,099
- "God bless us all, Tiny Tim."
- You're over the top, Charlie.

570
01:08:25,266 --> 01:08:29,179
Don't do anything stupid.

571
01:08:29,826 --> 01:08:32,545
Where's the fun in that?

572
01:08:32,746 --> 01:08:36,705
I just remembered,
I have to urinate.

573
01:08:36,866 --> 01:08:39,505
I'll pick this up later.

574
01:09:01,666 --> 01:09:04,305
I don't have the money.

575
01:09:04,466 --> 01:09:10,496
Go ahead and kill me.
Right now it'd be a relief.

576
01:09:10,666 --> 01:09:14,420
I hate to hear
that kind of fatalism, I really do.

577
01:09:14,586 --> 01:09:21,583
We can't keep on doing this because
it doesn't have any effect on you.

578
01:09:21,746 --> 01:09:26,217
What I do in a case like yours,
and I'm being forced here ...

579
01:09:26,386 --> 01:09:29,344
... is threaten someone you love.

580
01:09:29,506 --> 01:09:32,657
A wife. A child.

581
01:09:32,826 --> 01:09:37,138
- A brother ...
- Son of a bitch.

582
01:09:40,466 --> 01:09:43,856
Merry Christmas, Charlie.

583
01:09:51,386 --> 01:09:56,506
January 1st ...
or your nigger brother's dead.

584
01:11:32,826 --> 01:11:37,616
- What are you doing here, Frank?
- I want to talk about Charlie.

585
01:11:37,786 --> 01:11:40,937
He's in a lot of trouble.

586
01:12:23,386 --> 01:12:26,981
Gentlemen, keep the fires hot!

587
01:12:27,146 --> 01:12:31,697
- Where are you going?
- To talk to Mr. Brown.

588
01:12:31,866 --> 01:12:34,426
Get out of here.

589
01:12:34,586 --> 01:12:37,146
You missed.

590
01:12:39,106 --> 01:12:42,815
I hate that.

591
01:12:48,706 --> 01:12:53,860
- You've got a disgruntled employee.
- Kick his fucking ...

592
01:12:55,306 --> 01:12:59,219
You can't come in here like that.

593
01:12:59,386 --> 01:13:03,618
Stop fucking around.

594
01:13:03,786 --> 01:13:09,577
Bring him over here. I'll kill him.
You got big balls? I'll cut 'em off.

595
01:13:12,346 --> 01:13:14,985
What the hell are you doing?

596
01:13:15,146 --> 01:13:18,343
You bunch of pussies!

597
01:13:20,706 --> 01:13:26,975
- We're not getting along.
- You want some of me?

598
01:13:43,546 --> 01:13:46,458
What are you, stupid?

599
01:13:49,386 --> 01:13:52,059
You'll get your money.

600
01:13:52,226 --> 01:14:00,179
But if anything happens
to my brother ... You understand me?

601
01:14:06,586 --> 01:14:09,862
Oh yeah ...
Who are you calling a nigger?

602
01:14:52,786 --> 01:14:55,858
- Happy New Year.
- Hi. John.

603
01:14:57,226 --> 01:15:00,662
- Happy New Year.
- Johnny!

604
01:15:03,186 --> 01:15:07,225
Charlie came by earlier
and left it for you.

605
01:15:09,106 --> 01:15:13,099
- It took you long enough.
- I'm sorry I'm late.

606
01:15:14,146 --> 01:15:18,378
What is this dress you've got on?
Turn around.

607
01:15:18,546 --> 01:15:22,664
- This old rag?
- Just one you had in the closet?

608
01:15:22,826 --> 01:15:25,863
- You got a permit for this dress?
- You're happy.

609
01:15:26,026 --> 01:15:30,656
I did one last favour for Charlie.
so I'm feeling like a free man.

610
01:15:30,826 --> 01:15:32,896
"The Islands Call."

611
01:15:33,066 --> 01:15:37,856
- Charlie sent it over.
- Open it.

612
01:15:45,586 --> 01:15:49,545
- Damn it. He's gonna do it.
- Do what?

613
01:15:49,706 --> 01:15:52,459
Rob the money train.

614
01:15:52,626 --> 01:15:56,505
- Say again?
- He's gonna rob the money train.

615
01:15:56,666 --> 01:16:02,263
- He wants me in with him.
- Patterson will kill him.

616
01:16:02,426 --> 01:16:06,465
- Aren't you gonna do anything?
- Why should l?

617
01:16:06,626 --> 01:16:11,859
Charlie is going down ... and you
are the only family that he's got.

618
01:17:23,266 --> 01:17:25,177
Open up.

619
01:17:33,386 --> 01:17:35,217
Jesus Christ!

620
01:18:16,186 --> 01:18:18,097
Shoot!

621
01:18:32,106 --> 01:18:39,421
- The money train has been stolen!
- I've got to call Patterson.

622
01:18:59,146 --> 01:19:01,660
Out of the way!

623
01:19:08,106 --> 01:19:10,825
Move!

624
01:19:40,066 --> 01:19:42,705
Attention, everyone!

625
01:19:42,866 --> 01:19:46,461
The situation here
will be resolved immediately.

626
01:19:46,626 --> 01:19:52,496
These perpetrators are fools
and their luck just ran out.

627
01:19:52,666 --> 01:19:57,182
Let's get them. Remember:
The money train has not been stolen.

628
01:19:57,346 --> 01:20:03,740
It is still in our tunnel.
and soon it will be in our hands.

629
01:20:53,786 --> 01:20:56,619
Shit!

630
01:21:29,306 --> 01:21:32,742
You scared the shit out of me. man.

631
01:21:32,906 --> 01:21:36,979
- How did you find me?
- You told me the plan, remember?

632
01:21:37,146 --> 01:21:40,377
- Only Plan A. Now we're on B.
- What?

633
01:21:40,546 --> 01:21:44,334
- We'll figure it out.
- This is Plan B:

634
01:21:44,506 --> 01:21:50,297
- We leave without the money.
- I ain't down with that.

635
01:21:50,466 --> 01:21:57,463
- Then we've got a serious problem.
- Yeah, I guess we do.

636
01:22:00,306 --> 01:22:03,218
If you turn me in, you get a medal.

637
01:22:03,386 --> 01:22:08,255
- Get us the hell out of here.
- I thought you'd never ask.

638
01:22:12,826 --> 01:22:16,136
When this is over.
I'll knock you out.

639
01:22:19,466 --> 01:22:24,381
The money train is reported
going south on the A-line.

640
01:22:30,306 --> 01:22:37,223
This is Donald Patterson.
Shut down the train and surrender.

641
01:22:37,386 --> 01:22:39,422
Don't do that.

642
01:22:39,586 --> 01:22:46,503
Donald, the robbery's going great
and you'll still get your cut.

643
01:22:46,666 --> 01:22:50,295
You sons of bitches.
I don't know who you are, -

644
01:22:50,466 --> 01:22:56,302
- but when I get my hands on you
I'll rip your hearts out.

645
01:22:56,466 --> 01:22:59,936
I don't appreciate
that tone of voice.

646
01:23:01,946 --> 01:23:04,460
Don't even look at me.

647
01:23:06,746 --> 01:23:13,458
When Patterson trips the brakes,
our joyride is gonna be over.

648
01:23:13,626 --> 01:23:17,505
We have to bleed the brakes.

649
01:23:17,666 --> 01:23:23,901
- Great, then they can't stop us.
- Then we can't stop, either.

650
01:23:24,066 --> 01:23:29,936
It's bleed the brakes or end up
the butt brothers in D-block.

651
01:23:30,746 --> 01:23:33,783
Bleed the brakes.

652
01:23:36,746 --> 01:23:40,500
- Get me 42nd Street.
- Stand by for Chief Patterson.

653
01:23:40,666 --> 01:23:44,181
The money train is coming your way.
Shut her down.

654
01:23:44,346 --> 01:23:48,055
Trip her brakes.
Reach in and tear her guts out.

655
01:23:58,466 --> 01:24:03,176
Come on, baby. It's got to work.

656
01:24:06,586 --> 01:24:10,215
Yes!

657
01:24:11,826 --> 01:24:17,935
It didn't stop, sir.
I don't think it has any brakes.

658
01:24:24,626 --> 01:24:28,221
I want the shooters
on the Grand Street platform.

659
01:24:28,386 --> 01:24:34,655
- Aim at the motorman's cabin.
- Use a construction barricade.

660
01:24:34,826 --> 01:24:39,138
Good point.
I want a barricade in place now!

661
01:24:39,306 --> 01:24:43,618
That thing's reinforced steel.
They'll be killed.

662
01:24:47,786 --> 01:24:52,940
Money train, this is Patterson.
I have an information update.

663
01:24:53,106 --> 01:24:57,657
At the Grand Street Station we have
a reinforced steel barricade.

664
01:24:57,826 --> 01:25:01,865
Shut it down
and turn yourself in ...

665
01:25:02,026 --> 01:25:04,062
... or die!

666
01:25:04,546 --> 01:25:08,061
He's bluffing, right?

667
01:25:21,026 --> 01:25:24,541
You. over there.
You to. come with me.

668
01:25:28,426 --> 01:25:32,863
What are we gonna do?
We can't stop this thing.

669
01:25:33,026 --> 01:25:37,099
Go faster. Faster!

670
01:25:39,866 --> 01:25:43,222
Come on!

671
01:25:46,266 --> 01:25:50,259
Charlie ... he wasn't bluffing!

672
01:26:06,506 --> 01:26:08,940
Ready. Easy, now.

673
01:26:14,906 --> 01:26:17,784
Wait for my command.

674
01:26:19,786 --> 01:26:22,425
Fire!

675
01:27:04,466 --> 01:27:08,664
You're not gonna believe this.
The train broke the barricade.

676
01:27:32,586 --> 01:27:36,499
- I'll have to start clearing track.
- Wait a minute.

677
01:27:36,666 --> 01:27:40,295
- What's the nearest train?
- The 12:20. I'll sidetrack her.

678
01:27:40,466 --> 01:27:46,621
What? And give them a clear track?
Raise me the motorman.

679
01:27:46,786 --> 01:27:51,541
- Command to 12:20.
- 12:20 to Command.

680
01:27:51,706 --> 01:27:55,745
This is Donald Patterson.
Bypass all stops.

681
01:27:55,906 --> 01:27:59,421
- What's going on?
- Shut up and do your job!

682
01:28:08,466 --> 01:28:12,778
Maybe we're on the wrong train.
It didn't stop.

683
01:28:20,266 --> 01:28:25,704
Two trains are on the same track.
there could be a derailment.

684
01:28:25,866 --> 01:28:32,783
There'll be no derailment.
They'll shut the money train down.

685
01:28:32,946 --> 01:28:37,974
If the money train can't stop,
people could die.

686
01:28:38,146 --> 01:28:40,740
That's what we live with.

687
01:28:50,826 --> 01:28:55,342
- Charlie, what are you doing?
- I'm getting paid.

688
01:28:55,506 --> 01:28:59,055
- The money stays.
- Feel that.

689
01:28:59,226 --> 01:29:04,425
That's our freedom.
I'm not leaving here empty handed.

690
01:29:04,586 --> 01:29:10,661
"Charlie the loser."
I've heard that my whole life.

691
01:29:10,826 --> 01:29:17,538
- Thieves aren't winners.
- Save the lecture for Tahiti.

692
01:29:17,706 --> 01:29:20,095
No, forget it.

693
01:29:21,986 --> 01:29:27,344
Don't fuck with my fantasy!
lf you want out, get out of my face!

694
01:29:27,506 --> 01:29:33,661
- I won't let you ruin your life.
- How are you gonna save me?

695
01:29:41,266 --> 01:29:43,985
Get that foot off that bag!

696
01:29:51,186 --> 01:29:55,145
Don't try me. Are you trying me?

697
01:29:57,586 --> 01:30:04,139
- Just let it go.
- I'm taking the money, man.

698
01:30:36,626 --> 01:30:38,184
Damn!

699
01:30:45,426 --> 01:30:47,940
Give me your hand.

700
01:30:54,026 --> 01:30:57,382
Grab onto my hand!

701
01:30:57,546 --> 01:31:01,334
- I've got you, man.
- Charlie ...

702
01:31:02,546 --> 01:31:05,822
Come on. John.

703
01:31:28,786 --> 01:31:32,222
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

704
01:31:33,426 --> 01:31:38,659
- Are we straight?
- Yeah, we're straight.

705
01:31:50,106 --> 01:31:54,975
- Let's shut this puppy down.
- That's easier said than done.

706
01:31:55,146 --> 01:31:59,503
You and me. man.
What can stop us?

707
01:32:06,546 --> 01:32:10,095
My God!

708
01:32:34,026 --> 01:32:36,938
Patterson didn't clear the tracks.

709
01:32:37,106 --> 01:32:43,659
- We're gonna derail them.
- These people are gonna die.

710
01:32:43,826 --> 01:32:48,297
- Do something.
- The bitch won't move.

711
01:32:51,666 --> 01:32:53,657
Maximum speed.

712
01:32:53,826 --> 01:33:00,265
The other train's too fast!
We're fucking dead! You hear me?

713
01:33:04,426 --> 01:33:09,580
All emergency units,
head to Fort Hamilton Station.

714
01:33:15,106 --> 01:33:21,420
- Throw the damn thing in reverse.
- The train will do a somersault.

715
01:33:21,586 --> 01:33:26,535
- But we live, right?
- No, they live. We die.

716
01:33:27,666 --> 01:33:34,060
So be it. We hit the reverse switch
and say goodbye.

717
01:33:34,226 --> 01:33:38,265
- We don't have time for this.
- Just jump, man.

718
01:33:38,426 --> 01:33:41,543
I can't jump! We're in a tunnel!

719
01:33:41,706 --> 01:33:45,460
This is my responsibility.
It's my fuckup!

720
01:33:45,626 --> 01:33:47,821
We're in this together.

721
01:34:01,786 --> 01:34:04,619
What are you doing?

722
01:34:04,786 --> 01:34:08,540
Are you gonna pole vault
out of here?

723
01:34:10,826 --> 01:34:16,219
Autopilot. When this hits,
it'll throw her into reverse.

724
01:34:26,666 --> 01:34:31,262
- What the hell are you doing?
- I don't know.

725
01:34:35,906 --> 01:34:39,694
- Where's my train?
- It's to minutes out.

726
01:34:39,866 --> 01:34:42,016
Good!

727
01:34:49,626 --> 01:34:52,936
When we get out of this,
remind me ...

728
01:34:55,466 --> 01:34:58,936
Don't let go.

729
01:35:05,426 --> 01:35:09,260
Get to the front.

730
01:36:27,866 --> 01:36:32,986
- Are they dead?
- There's nobody here.

731
01:36:33,146 --> 01:36:36,377
They're here.

732
01:36:39,186 --> 01:36:43,065
They're here. You fuck with my train
and I'll find you.

733
01:36:46,306 --> 01:36:49,218
I'll find you.

734
01:36:51,266 --> 01:36:55,862
- Shit! Is that Patterson?
- Get out of my way.

735
01:36:56,946 --> 01:37:00,734
- What are we gonna do?
- I'll find you.

736
01:37:00,906 --> 01:37:04,455
Be cool.

737
01:37:06,386 --> 01:37:10,743
- We came as fast as we could.
- What a mess.

738
01:37:10,906 --> 01:37:15,024
- If we can help ...
- All you've got to do is ask.

739
01:37:15,186 --> 01:37:22,581
- What are you doing here?
- We just want to help.

740
01:37:22,746 --> 01:37:28,343
How's your cock working now that
you ain't got a badge any more?

741
01:37:28,506 --> 01:37:32,738
This is what I think of you,
you fuckup ...

742
01:37:32,906 --> 01:37:35,374
You spit in my face?

743
01:37:35,546 --> 01:37:38,856
You aren't gonna hit him ...
I'm gonna hit him!

744
01:37:39,026 --> 01:37:41,586
We'll both hit him.

745
01:37:49,546 --> 01:37:52,697
Arrest those to for assault.

746
01:37:54,866 --> 01:38:00,498
No, Patterson, I'm arresting you.
You endangered people's lives.

747
01:38:02,266 --> 01:38:05,383
Did you see that?

748
01:38:07,466 --> 01:38:10,503
Arrest his ass! He tried to kill us!

749
01:38:10,666 --> 01:38:15,456
- Who are you?
- You don't remember me?

750
01:38:15,626 --> 01:38:19,938
Officer Santiago.

751
01:38:45,586 --> 01:38:49,659
- We did it!
- We did it!

752
01:38:51,186 --> 01:38:54,223
Happy New Year.

753
01:38:54,386 --> 01:38:57,139
I love you, man.

754
01:38:57,306 --> 01:39:02,300
- What is that?
- I've put on some weight.

755
01:39:02,466 --> 01:39:08,985
- What are you, six months pregnant?
- You're gonna overreact on this.

756
01:39:11,106 --> 01:39:14,815
- I knew you'd overreact.
- Overreact?

757
01:39:14,986 --> 01:39:18,342
We risked our lives. man.

758
01:39:18,506 --> 01:39:21,862
It's New Year's.

759
01:39:22,026 --> 01:39:28,818
- I saved your life.
- It's a miracle we're alive.
