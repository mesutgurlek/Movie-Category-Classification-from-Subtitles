1
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:54,304
Law offices.

2
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,603
You know what I want to be
when I grow up?

3
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:03,813
- What?
- A fisherman.

4
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:07,442
I want to go fishing every
day till I'm rich

5
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,652
so I can move
right next door to the jailhouse,

6
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:11,363
so I can be close to my mommy.

7
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:16,910
She got arrested for drugs again,
so she has to go back.

8
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,082
I'm sorry to hear that.

9
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:29,255
My mommy's breath smells so bad
'cause she smokes so much crack.

10
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,760
What do you think?

11
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:36,304
What do I think? About what?

12
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:41,309
My mommy's bad breath.

13
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,478
Maybe it'll get better.

14
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:50,985
Thank you. That helps.

15
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:55,156
- Yeah. Yeah! Thanks for nothing, Derek.
- What is the matter with you, Kimmie?

16
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,992
All right, come on.
We got to go see your grandpa.

17
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:00,161
Not Grandpa. He's a kook!

18
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:04,874
Oh, my goodness. You are limber!

19
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:13,591
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

20
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:27,397
Well, hello! I think I know her.

21
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,037
Mr. Zisman?

22
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,247
Mr. Zisman.

23
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,082
Mr. Zisman!

24
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,417
Hi.

25
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:50,754
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

26
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:56,593
Your wife, she took a turn for the
worse last night and she passed away.

27
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:00,722
I'm so sorry.

28
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,104
I thought she'd never die.

29
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:15,445
I'm going to let you process this,
and I'll be back in just a moment, okay?

30
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:18,448
Thank you. Thank you, Doc!

31
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:24,954
Don't get me wrong, I'm upset,
but she was a crabby old bat.

32
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,082
Well, I'm sorry for your loss.

33
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,418
She hadn't given me any nookie
since the '90s.

34
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,754
And then it was only out of spite.

35
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:35,632
She's in a much better place.

36
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,469
And I'm in a much better place.

37
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:45,183
Did you hear that, Leroy?
We're free!

38
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,687
I'm free.

39
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,337
Hello, lady.

40
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,933
Thanks a lot.

41
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:55,879
Shit!

42
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:33,500
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.

43
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,419
Miss.

44
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,963
Sir, can you help me?
Can you help me, sir?

45
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,924
I don't expect you to understand,

46
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:44,302
but I have my penis
stuck to the soda machine.

47
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,306
Gabriel! I'm stuck.

48
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:54,104
- What's wrong?
- My penis is stuck in the machine!

49
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,815
Gabriel! Help me!

50
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,150
Help me! Gabriel!

51
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:01,319
Gabriel!

52
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,493
Sir. Could you help me, sir?

53
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,788
This nigga's dick's stuck
in the machine, yo!

54
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,164
Please don't announce it!

55
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:14,624
It's fucking embarrassing!

56
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,459
Can you help me
instead of announcing?

57
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:18,962
Well, help! Give me a hand!

58
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,343
He's trying to get it out!

59
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:28,638
- Oh, no!
- Stop, man!

60
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:32,517
Sir?

61
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:35,020
Don't... It's not
going to come out.

62
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,229
Fuck.

63
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,857
Don't! Quit pulling on it.

64
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,443
I got to get... Oh, God!

65
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,697
Push! Push! God! Push! Push!

66
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,824
Oh, God! Oh, God!

67
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,429
<i>Thank you, kind people,
for being here today.</i>

68
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:15,185
<i>I never thought my wife's funeral
would be filled with complete strangers,</i>

69
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:19,189
<i>but we've outlived all our friends.</i>

70
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:22,942
<i>I was hoping my daughter and
grandson could make it but...</i>

71
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,613
<i>They didn't.</i>

72
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:33,912
<i>So, I would especially like to
thank the choir and caterers,</i>

73
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:38,875
<i>and all the nice people
sitting before me.</i>

74
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,086
<i>I wish I had more time with her.</i>

75
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:45,715
<i>I wish so much of our time
had not been consumed by combat.</i>

76
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,719
<i>I wish I'd tried a little harder
to make that happen.</i>

77
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,514
<i>Because she's gone now.</i>

78
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:56,309
<i>And our history on this earth
has been written...</i>

79
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,646
<i>Baby.</i>

80
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,731
I'm glad you made it.

81
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,651
- Hi, buddy.
- Hi.

82
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,404
Sit.

83
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,656
This is my daughter and grandson.

84
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,910
Can I have a word with you?

85
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,247
Yeah, I'm in the
middle of something.

86
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,915
Billy, just stay
there for a second.

87
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,084
I just want to
talk to your granddad outside.

88
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,168
Okay, Mom.

89
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,338
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

90
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,302
Hi, Billy.

91
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:32,595
<i>What's so important?</i>

92
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,889
<i>Listen, I'm sorry
that she's dead and everything,</i>

93
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:36,599
<i>but I'm in some serious shit, okay?</i>

94
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,768
<i>- What is it this time?</i>
- You tell him about the microphone.

95
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,062
<i>Don't even start that with me!
Not now!</i>

96
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:43,064
<i>Okay? It wasn't even my fault!</i>

97
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:45,775
<i>This cop, he's got
a bug up his ass,</i>

98
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:48,945
<i>and then they give me this
public defender who's a fucking idiot!</i>

99
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,364
<i>- And...</i>
- Sir, excuse me. The microphone is on.

100
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,284
<i>Please, just give me a moment.
Just give me a moment.</i>

101
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:59,789
<i>Look, I violated my parole and now
they're gonna send me to jail.</i>

102
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:03,001
<i>I just need you to
take Billy across the country</i>

103
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:04,961
<i>so he can be with his dad for a while.
Okay?</i>

104
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:06,087
<i>What?</i>

105
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:09,090
<i>I can't have Bobby with me now.
I'm in mourning!</i>

106
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:11,009
<i>It's Billy. Billy!</i>

107
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,303
<i>How am I supposed to know
what his name is?</i>

108
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,929
<i>You never brought him around!</i>

109
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,348
<i>Shit.</i>

110
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:19,142
<i>I cannot have Billy with me now.</i>

111
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:21,936
<i>I am a free man
for the first time in 46 years</i>

112
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:25,482
<i>and I can't be saddled
with that cockblock!</i>

113
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,691
<i>That's just fine.</i>

114
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:27,942
<i>You were never there for me
when I was little,</i>

115
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,778
<i>so I guess it's no
different now, is it?</i>

116
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,322
I'm going to talk to my mom.

117
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,165
<i>I am very sorry.</i>

118
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,168
<i>Everyone's very
emotional right now.</i>

119
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:46,711
<i>It's a very difficult
time for the family.</i>

120
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,841
<i>I don't know what to say.</i>

121
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:56,763
Sweetie, come here.
That's your mother's.

122
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,683
- She told me I could have it.
- Give me the... Give it...

123
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,769
Don't do this in front of them!
Don't do this right now!

124
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:05,522
- Just stop...
- Oh, no!

125
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,940
Oh, God! Jesus!

126
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:08,858
Oh, no.

127
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,068
Grandma?

128
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:12,404
- I love you.
- Oh, baby.

129
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:15,407
Sorry, Daddy.

130
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,075
Oh, baby!

131
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:20,745
Oh, my God!

132
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:23,915
Sing! Please, choir, sing something.
Somebody help.

133
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:28,378
<i>I've got the joy, joy, joy, joy
down in my heart</i>

134
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,548
<i>Down in my heart,
down in my heart</i>

135
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:35,260
<i>I've got the joy, joy, joy, joy
down in my heart</i>

136
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:38,596
<i>Down in my heart to stay</i>

137
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:42,308
<i>I've got the love of Jesus
down in my heart</i>

138
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:43,393
<i>Where?</i>

139
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:46,104
<i>Down in my heart,
down in my heart</i>

140
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:50,442
<i>I've got the love of Jesus
down in my heart</i>

141
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:53,778
<i>Down in my heart to stay</i>

142
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:57,615
<i>I've got the joy, joy, joy, joy
down in my heart</i>

143
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:00,285
<i>Down in my heart to stay</i>

144
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:44,329
Fuck.

145
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:50,794
Where are we going?

146
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:53,296
We're going here to get on a
computer call with your dad

147
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,382
to see when he's gonna
pick your little ass up.

148
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:59,177
And I got someone meeting us to help
me and your father communicate,

149
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:01,012
seeing how we don't get along.

150
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,306
Are you Mr. Zisman?

151
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,724
- Hi.
- Shirley Kreska.

152
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:06,226
- Nice to meet you, Shirley.
- Nice to meet you.

153
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:09,312
Well, tell me the
purpose of the call.

154
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:11,898
His mother is going to jail.

155
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,317
But she wanted me to
get him to his father.

156
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:17,362
We've had lots of problems
out of the father.

157
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,031
He's nearly impossible
to communicate with.

158
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:23,493
But is your goal to
get him to his dad?

159
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,994
Yes, yes.

160
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:27,372
I got him up on the computer now.

161
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:31,710
All right, Chuck. This is Shirley.

162
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:34,212
Hi, Chuck. I'm a local counselor,

163
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:38,258
and I'm just here to help the two of you
reach whatever goals you want to reach

164
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:40,260
and just help the two
of you talk together.

165
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:41,386
<i>Okay.</i>

166
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:47,892
So, Kimmie is going to jail again,
all right?

167
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:49,728
<i>Doesn't surprise me.</i>

168
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:53,732
So I'm gonna need you to come
get Billy, like, from me.

169
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:57,527
Why are you shaking your head?

170
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:00,530
<i>'Cause this is real bad timing
right now for me.</i>

171
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:03,533
<i>And I'm having some problems
with my business right now.</i>

172
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:06,578
- Okay.
- Your business? What business is that?

173
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,079
<i>I sell computers.</i>

174
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:10,373
Sell... He couldn't sell
pussy on a troop train.

175
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:12,208
<i>That's a disgusting thing to say.</i>

176
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,710
Okay, but that doesn't help.
That doesn't help.

177
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:15,253
You're right. You're right.

178
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:16,713
I'm sorry for insulting you.

179
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:21,092
Are you serious?

180
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:23,803
This is a disaster.

181
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:26,431
All right, Chuck.

182
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,600
If you can't come to Lincoln,

183
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:32,270
then I'll just bring him to you
in North Carolina.

184
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:34,939
<i>No. 'Cause I don't have money
to take care of a kid.</i>

185
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:37,817
<i>My cousin, he just had
to take his baby girl,</i>

186
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:40,570
<i>and the state's paying him
$600 a month for free.</i>

187
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:42,906
Are you sure you want
him to go to him?

188
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,616
<i>- He's getting 600 bucks?
- A month.</i>

189
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,076
Wait, what are they saying?

190
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:48,787
She's saying possibly
he could get money for keeping him.

191
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:50,914
<i>I think I can work
something out.</i>

192
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:56,961
<i>I think that if Irving was to bring him
here to Raleigh, I could take the kid.</i>

193
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,464
And then if it didn't work out...

194
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:02,258
<i>600 bucks a month
will make it work for me.</i>

195
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:05,845
So... And that isn't guaranteed,
what she just said.

196
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:06,930
It's something
you would have to investigate.

197
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,973
<i>No, no, it's guaranteed.
She's always right.</i>

198
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:10,308
<i>It's a done deal, man.
Drop him off.</i>

199
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,019
- All right, 2:00 on Sunday.<i>
- 2:00 p.m. Sunday.</i>

200
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:17,273
<i>Great, man. Great. Great.</i>

201
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:19,442
<i>There goes like half my inventory.</i>

202
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:20,944
What a wonderful business you have.

203
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,362
Okay. Chuck, what's your last name?

204
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:24,614
<i>- Muskie.</i>
- M...

205
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:27,617
<i>- M-U-S-K-I-E.</i>
- Okay.

206
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:31,162
- D-O-U-C-H-E is how you spell it.<i>
- Yeah.</i>

207
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:35,166
<i>That's right.
F-A-G-O-T is your last name.</i>

208
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,293
Your son's right here,
if you don't mind.

209
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:39,337
Let's just walk away.

210
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:42,007
<i>Suck it.</i>

211
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,633
"Suck it," that's nice.

212
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:45,343
<i>Suck a bowl of dicks.</i>

213
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:48,013
- Bye, Dad.<i>
- Bye, Billy!</i>

214
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,973
Bye.

215
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:04,487
How much is this?

216
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:06,823
Is there a price tag on it?

217
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,324
I don't... There's a...

218
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,161
That's one of my
wife's favorite lamps.

219
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,871
- It's very pretty.
- Yes.

220
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:16,791
She died of vagitosis.

221
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,502
It's kind of like bad breath,
but the vagina.

222
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:22,547
It wasn't the main cause, but...

223
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:25,050
- It didn't help.
- Yeah.

224
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:26,134
That's...

225
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:28,928
I'm sorry to hear that.

226
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:31,890
Do you like this chair?

227
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:33,850
That is pretty cool.

228
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,560
It's only $25.

229
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,395
That's nice.

230
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:40,857
This bed's going for
a pretty good price.

231
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:43,068
I'd like to lay down
and take a nap myself.

232
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:45,195
- I'm tired all the time.
- Yeah.

233
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:46,696
Is it one of those
ones that adjusts?

234
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,281
Yes, ma'am, it's really good.

235
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:53,536
It's one of those that kind of
sit up while you're watching TV.

236
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:56,247
Here, try... I'll...

237
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,918
Try to adjust it a little.

238
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:02,754
Stop!

239
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:04,631
Oh, my God!

240
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:06,383
Stop. Oh, my God!

241
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,885
Stop, stop! Stop!

242
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:10,345
Unplug it!

243
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:13,056
Oh, my God!
What are you trying to do to me?

244
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:15,767
All I did was push
the little button!

245
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:20,730
Oh, God! Put it down!
Put it... Cramp! Cramp!

246
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:22,941
It's unplugged!

247
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:25,652
It's unplugged, I pulled the plug.

248
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:26,986
Oh, my God.

249
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,489
Unplug that thing
over there, please.

250
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:30,907
I'm getting off.

251
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:33,076
Oh, God.

252
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,369
- Let Grandpa sit.
- I pushed the little button.

253
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:35,495
He told me to push
the little button.

254
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,247
Let Grandpa sit.

255
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:42,085
I think I'm going to have a heart attack.
I really do.

256
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:45,797
Well, let's not make this
all about you, honey.

257
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,925
No, no, I'm telling her.
I'm not making it...

258
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:53,346
Look...

259
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:55,265
Just calm down. It's okay.

260
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:56,641
My breathing won't come back.

261
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:59,811
You can have the bed for $50.

262
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:02,647
No, I don't want that bed.

263
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:20,331
Coming!

264
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:25,503
Hey, sir, how are you?

265
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,297
Do you have a bed
we're supposed to pick up?

266
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:29,257
- Right this way.
- Alrighty.

267
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:31,509
- My name's Irving, what's your name?
- Tom.

268
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:33,428
Tom. How are you, Tom? Come on in.

269
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:35,472
This is my grandson, Billy.

270
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:36,973
- Hi, Billy. How are you?
- Hi.

271
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:38,475
- What's your name, sir?
- I'm James.

272
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:41,853
James. How are you, James?
Come on in. We're back here.

273
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:47,359
And my wife just passed away
a couple days ago

274
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:49,986
and the damn funeral home
had a little misunderstanding.

275
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:52,364
Like, you know what,
"We'll just take her right back."

276
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:55,533
We want to get her in my trunk,

277
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:58,995
because we're gonna
bury her down south a ways.

278
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:02,916
If you could help me to my car,
I would really appreciate it.

279
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,377
Let me just...

280
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:08,046
Okay...

281
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,382
Just wrap her up.

282
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:13,551
I think it'll be easiest
if you just pull like that.

283
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:16,554
Yeah. She was a pain in my ass
when we were married

284
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:20,183
and she passed away,
she's still being a pain in my ass.

285
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:23,895
Just grab that right there.

286
00:18:24,396 --> 00:18:26,564
James, will you get the head?

287
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,069
Be gentle with her.

288
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:32,987
Here you go, James.

289
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:36,449
- Here you go.
- Lord have mercy. Jesus.

290
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:37,701
There you go.

291
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:39,536
Don't let her fall
out of there, James.

292
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:41,079
Get a good hold on her.

293
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:43,748
Oh, man. We're...

294
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:47,877
We got to get this little
boy to his father.

295
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:49,963
His mom just got thrown in jail.

296
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:51,548
My mom's on drugs.

297
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:52,924
Lord have mercy!

298
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:55,218
Thank you, boys.
I couldn't carry her myself.

299
00:18:57,971 --> 00:18:59,806
Just put her right in there.

300
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,143
And we got blankets
to keep her warm.

301
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,146
All right, be careful with her.

302
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:13,278
All right.

303
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:17,323
Thank you. Thank you, James.

304
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,201
Come here, Billy.

305
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:22,912
Grab his hand. Can we say a prayer?

306
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:29,085
Lord, please look after Billy and I
on our journey with Ellie.

307
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:34,841
And Lord, please look after these men
because they were very sweet

308
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:36,593
and they're also accomplices

309
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:39,429
to probably
what was technically a crime,

310
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,639
but we're not gonna say anything.

311
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:44,726
Come on, man! Are you serious?

312
00:19:44,768 --> 00:19:46,353
In your name we pray. Amen.

313
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:47,520
Amen.

314
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:48,938
All right.

315
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:51,608
Let me ask you a question,
is the bed really going?

316
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:54,235
No, no. I just needed help with her.

317
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:56,112
But no one's going to come out...

318
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,281
No one's going to come out
to help if you say,

319
00:19:58,323 --> 00:19:59,949
"Can you come help me
commit a crime?"

320
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:02,285
No one's gonna help. So...

321
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:05,038
We...

322
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:08,291
That's why we had to
tell a little fib.

323
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:12,003
But we surely appreciate it.
And our lips are sealed.

324
00:20:12,087 --> 00:20:13,505
- Later.
- Thank the men.

325
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:14,589
See you, Billy.

326
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:15,965
- Thank you.
- Thank you, fellas!

327
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:17,050
See you later.

328
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:19,386
God bless you.
God bless you, James. Thank you!

329
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:21,137
Thanks for the crime!

330
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:23,598
Now get your crap.
We got to hit the road.

331
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:27,852
All right.

332
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:30,355
Grandpa, do you think
we'll have time to go fishing?

333
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:33,608
Don't worry me with that.
Just get in the damn car.

334
00:20:50,542 --> 00:20:52,836
I hope you went
to the bathroom already.

335
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,379
- Nope.
- "Nope"?

336
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:57,132
Well, you're gonna have to hold it.

337
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:21,322
Can I turn on the AC?

338
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:22,824
No.

339
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,828
Can I turn on the radio?

340
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:28,329
No!

341
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:31,499
Let's just play the quiet game.

342
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,838
Can we get something to eat?

343
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:39,424
You're already eating.

344
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:42,010
- But I'm hungry!
- Whatever.

345
00:21:42,594 --> 00:21:44,846
Anything to get out of this car.

346
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:50,518
<i>Hola,</i> gorgeous!
I gotta feed this little prick.

347
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:56,024
She is <i>muy bonita,</i> huh? My goodness!

348
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:59,694
Grandpa, look at that ride!
Can I go ride it?

349
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:01,696
- What?
- Can I go ride that?

350
00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:05,033
Yes. Shit.

351
00:22:05,617 --> 00:22:08,453
- Scram.
- Thank you.

352
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:10,914
- What's your name?
- Gloria.

353
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:14,125
My Spanish name
is <i>El Mucho Ding-Dong.</i>

354
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:17,087
- It doesn't work!
- Oh, God.

355
00:22:17,212 --> 00:22:18,880
- Grandpa!
- What?

356
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:20,340
This thing doesn't work!

357
00:22:21,216 --> 00:22:23,927
- What do you want me to do about it?
- Fix it!

358
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:27,389
- Can't you see I was talking to a lady?
- Yes, but look!

359
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,808
Did you put money in there? God.

360
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:32,727
- Try it. It doesn't work.
- Oh, God!

361
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:42,779
Nothing!

362
00:22:49,327 --> 00:22:50,704
Sit down, sit down.

363
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,628
- I'm all right!
- Sit down, sir.

364
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:00,171
Sit, sit, sit!

365
00:23:00,255 --> 00:23:02,173
Are you okay, Grandpa?

366
00:23:02,257 --> 00:23:03,842
Look what happened!

367
00:23:04,426 --> 00:23:06,678
- Jesus!
- It didn't work!

368
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:08,638
Why'd you tell me to get in there?

369
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,682
'Cause I wanted you to fix it.

370
00:23:10,932 --> 00:23:13,101
Well, it's fixed!

371
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:16,354
Unbelievable!
You could have broke my neck!

372
00:23:16,771 --> 00:23:18,356
I didn't do anything!

373
00:23:20,275 --> 00:23:22,610
I can't do it. I can't do it.

374
00:23:23,445 --> 00:23:24,863
- Do what?
- This!

375
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:27,866
I can't do this.

376
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:32,120
I said I'd get you to your father's,
but I didn't say how.

377
00:23:32,954 --> 00:23:35,290
Grandpa, my leg's falling asleep!

378
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:36,833
Look, you little shitbird,

379
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:39,878
I'm not driving you and you're
too young to ride the bus,

380
00:23:40,003 --> 00:23:41,838
so you keep quiet in there!

381
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,885
You need some help?

382
00:23:46,968 --> 00:23:48,678
- I think I got it.
- Okay.

383
00:23:49,304 --> 00:23:50,972
- Oh, my goodness.
- Okay.

384
00:23:51,973 --> 00:23:54,225
- Here we go.
- Okay.

385
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:58,646
I'm going to send this
to Raleigh, North Carolina.

386
00:23:58,897 --> 00:24:00,231
Raleigh? Okay.

387
00:24:00,482 --> 00:24:01,816
Eighteen width.

388
00:24:05,987 --> 00:24:07,530
- Forty-seven?
- Forty-seven.

389
00:24:07,572 --> 00:24:08,907
- Forty-seven.
- Yeah.

390
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:12,327
- Damn it.
- Okay.

391
00:24:12,369 --> 00:24:13,870
There's something
moving around in there.

392
00:24:13,995 --> 00:24:14,996
Really?

393
00:24:15,497 --> 00:24:16,831
- No. No.
- No?

394
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:20,418
There's something in that box!

395
00:24:20,502 --> 00:24:21,711
No.

396
00:24:21,753 --> 00:24:24,714
There's nothing in the box?
It sounds like it!

397
00:24:24,756 --> 00:24:28,176
I do hear stuff in here,
but it's not coming from there.

398
00:24:28,218 --> 00:24:29,928
- Okay. Can we unstrap it?
- You mind if we unstrap it?

399
00:24:30,011 --> 00:24:32,889
- Yes... No, let's unstrap it.
- Okay.

400
00:24:33,014 --> 00:24:34,557
Grandpa, I got to pee.

401
00:24:35,934 --> 00:24:36,935
What...

402
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:39,521
Keep it down.

403
00:24:40,355 --> 00:24:43,400
It's a statue.
I have a statue in there.

404
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:47,070
- It still has batteries in it or something?
- Yes, it has the batteries in it still.

405
00:24:47,195 --> 00:24:48,571
Okay. Okay.

406
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:52,742
Yeah, it's just one of those kind
that you hit a button and it...

407
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:54,369
So we shook it.

408
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:55,787
Yeah, yeah.

409
00:24:58,373 --> 00:25:00,709
Grandpa, I got to pee real bad.

410
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,085
It's a statue.

411
00:25:02,293 --> 00:25:03,628
Are you sure?

412
00:25:03,712 --> 00:25:05,964
It was settling. It was settling.

413
00:25:06,047 --> 00:25:07,924
Okay. All right.

414
00:25:07,966 --> 00:25:09,634
Can we get it weighed?
Because I gotta...

415
00:25:09,884 --> 00:25:12,512
- You gotta get out?
- Yes, and I appreciate you girls...

416
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,641
Would you...

417
00:25:16,975 --> 00:25:18,309
God, what are you doing?

418
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,311
We were shipping a human being!

419
00:25:20,562 --> 00:25:21,980
Oh, my.

420
00:25:22,063 --> 00:25:23,398
Oh, my!

421
00:25:23,648 --> 00:25:24,899
We can't ship humans.

422
00:25:24,941 --> 00:25:30,113
I'm trying to get him to his father,
and I don't want to drive him.

423
00:25:30,405 --> 00:25:31,740
Oh, my goodness!

424
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:33,324
It'll get there overnight.

425
00:25:33,575 --> 00:25:34,909
You know that they're just gonna be

426
00:25:34,951 --> 00:25:36,661
throwing you around and everything,
don't you?

427
00:25:36,745 --> 00:25:39,664
Well, give me a pen
and we'll write "fragile" on it.

428
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:42,292
Are you sure you want to do this?

429
00:25:42,334 --> 00:25:43,835
You need a blanket?

430
00:25:43,918 --> 00:25:45,795
- We can't ship a human!
- I'll take one.

431
00:25:45,837 --> 00:25:48,506
You can
if you didn't know this happened.

432
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:51,426
I can't ship you. You're living!

433
00:25:51,676 --> 00:25:54,929
- Should we call the police on them?
- Oh, no! No police.

434
00:25:58,391 --> 00:26:00,477
Just help me get him out of the box.
I'll take him.

435
00:26:00,643 --> 00:26:02,562
Shit! Come on.

436
00:26:12,614 --> 00:26:14,783
Been in this car all damn day!

437
00:26:15,116 --> 00:26:16,868
I need a break.

438
00:26:19,037 --> 00:26:20,538
Where are we going?

439
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:23,166
Grandpa's going to
play a little bingo.

440
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:24,876
- Can I come?
- No!

441
00:26:25,418 --> 00:26:29,881
Look. They don't allow kids and I'm
going to be talking to ladies in there.

442
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:32,384
And I don't need you cockblocking.

443

00:26:43,144 --> 00:26:45,480
It's been a while since I've played.

447
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:49,234
Nice to meet you, ma'am. Good luck.

448
00:26:49,317 --> 00:26:50,485
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

449
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:52,404
- My name is O.Z.
- O.Z.!

450
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:53,571
- O.Z.
- All right!

451
00:26:53,988 --> 00:26:55,699
Can I cheat off you?

452

00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:05,667
O.Z., what do you say we blow this joint
and go play a little strip bingo outside?

455
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,127
Stop it.

456
00:27:08,503 --> 00:27:10,672
That damn dauber's not...

457
00:27:11,506 --> 00:27:14,217
God damn it.
Done spilled everywhere.

458

<i>N-62.</i>

459
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:22,851
Stop the game. Stop!

460
00:27:22,934 --> 00:27:25,353
Oh, my gosh!

461
00:27:27,772 --> 00:27:30,025
I think this shit's done gone bad.

462
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:32,819
Oh, my God!

463
00:27:33,361 --> 00:27:37,032
He just drunk the dauber shit.

464
00:27:37,073 --> 00:27:39,075
Oh, man! You can't do that!

465
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:40,702
Hell, no!

466
00:27:41,995 --> 00:27:43,288
Stop.

467
00:27:43,371 --> 00:27:44,539
Stop!

468
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:46,416
Stop? Hell, keep going!

469
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:49,377
- You're making everybody sick.
- No, come on, come on!

470
00:27:49,878 --> 00:27:53,214
Let's go back to the damn game,
all right?

471
00:27:55,216 --> 00:27:58,553
God damn!
You guys are driving me to drink!

472
00:27:59,387 --> 00:28:01,056
I need a drink.

473
00:28:04,851 --> 00:28:06,353
What the hell you got?

474
00:28:06,436 --> 00:28:09,773
I got a damn margarita!
Who wants a margarita?

475
00:28:13,068 --> 00:28:15,487
O.Z., half of this is for you.

476
00:28:15,653 --> 00:28:18,073
How about a little fun, people?

477
00:28:38,134 --> 00:28:41,429
Excuse me? Sir?
Can you tie my shoe, please?

478
00:28:41,471 --> 00:28:42,555
Yeah, sure.

479
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:44,474
- Are you married?
- Yeah.

480
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:48,770
- Are you happily married?
- Yeah, I guess so.

481
00:28:52,107 --> 00:28:53,858
Why do you ask?

482
00:28:55,443 --> 00:28:58,071
- I want a new dad.
- Do you?

483
00:28:58,154 --> 00:29:00,198
Yeah, sorry.

484
00:29:00,281 --> 00:29:03,034
- What's your name?
- Dan.

485
00:29:03,118 --> 00:29:05,787
Hey, Dan, I got an idea.

486
00:29:07,956 --> 00:29:10,291
How about me being your new kid?

487
00:29:13,294 --> 00:29:15,588
I don't know
if it's really quite that simple.

488
00:29:15,672 --> 00:29:17,632
You know, you can't really...

489
00:29:17,674 --> 00:29:18,675
Why?

490
00:29:18,758 --> 00:29:22,220
You can't really trade kids
between families, can you?

491
00:29:22,303 --> 00:29:24,139
Sure you can, Dad.

492
00:29:24,556 --> 00:29:28,852
You know, when I was overseas,
when you would sleep with a prostitute,

493
00:29:28,893 --> 00:29:31,604
they would squeeze lime juice
on your <i>schmeckle</i>

494
00:29:31,688 --> 00:29:33,565
to see if you had any diseases.

495
00:29:33,648 --> 00:29:35,191
And if you went...

496
00:29:36,317 --> 00:29:39,487
It means you got something,
'cause the cuts burn.

497
00:29:40,155 --> 00:29:43,158
I never went... But one time.

498
00:29:47,495 --> 00:29:49,748
It's all cleared up now, though.

499
00:29:49,831 --> 00:29:52,167
Ma'am, it's all cleared up.

500
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:53,543
- Okay.
- All right.

501
00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:56,629
Just to prove to you
I don't have anything, ladies,

502
00:29:56,713 --> 00:29:59,299
I'm gonna squeeze this lime juice
on my <i>schmeckle</i> right now.

503
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,884
Oh, my God!

504
00:30:00,925 --> 00:30:01,926
Okay.

505
00:30:02,344 --> 00:30:04,763
Why resist? Watch this.
Here it goes. Here it goes!

506
00:30:04,846 --> 00:30:07,182
Nothing. Nothing.

507
00:30:07,682 --> 00:30:09,517
I got nothing.

508
00:30:09,601 --> 00:30:11,853
That is free advertising
right there.

509
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:15,607
It did sting a little when it got to
my bunghole though, I'll tell you that.

510
00:30:16,191 --> 00:30:18,401
That's just between us girls.

511
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,029
I'm gonna have to
have that checked out.

512
00:30:22,197 --> 00:30:23,865
What happened to your dad?

513
00:30:25,283 --> 00:30:26,785
Hey, Dad.

514
00:30:26,868 --> 00:30:28,953
Yeah, what happened to him?

515
00:30:29,037 --> 00:30:30,789
No, you're my dad.

516
00:30:30,872 --> 00:30:32,415
High five, Dad.

517
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:34,876
Down low. Too slow.

518
00:30:35,627 --> 00:30:37,879
Yeah, that one's been around
for a while.

519
00:30:40,882 --> 00:30:42,217
Who are you here with?

520
00:30:42,425 --> 00:30:44,427
You. My new dad.

521
00:30:44,719 --> 00:30:47,222
Well, I'm not your new dad. But...

522
00:30:47,263 --> 00:30:48,723
You're funny.

523
00:30:51,393 --> 00:30:53,395
Hey, Dad, look at me in the eye.

524
00:30:54,062 --> 00:30:56,189
- Like...
- I love you.

525
00:30:56,648 --> 00:30:58,608
Anyway, I need to...

526
00:31:01,403 --> 00:31:04,739
I got stuff I have
to do, so be safe.

527
00:31:06,074 --> 00:31:07,701
Love you, Dad!

528
00:31:09,744 --> 00:31:11,287
Here she is!

529
00:31:11,329 --> 00:31:12,831
Here I am. You want to buy some 22s?

530
00:31:13,081 --> 00:31:15,000
- What are 22s?
- You wish you was 22.

531
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:18,086
They look like 36D's to me.

532
00:31:19,295 --> 00:31:20,338
No.

533
00:31:20,422 --> 00:31:23,591
No? 36 full C's.

534
00:31:24,092 --> 00:31:26,803
22s, that's what they are!

535
00:31:27,762 --> 00:31:29,514
Can I use your pen?

536
00:31:30,932 --> 00:31:32,684
Yes, you may, sweetheart.

537
00:31:32,767 --> 00:31:36,521
- All right! How you doing?
- Okay.

538
00:31:36,604 --> 00:31:40,650
- You know, you're pretty sexy.
- Thank you.

539
00:31:40,692 --> 00:31:42,777
I mean really sexy.

540
00:31:43,653 --> 00:31:44,696
I...

541
00:31:44,779 --> 00:31:47,282
- I have to take this up there.
- All right.

542
00:31:53,538 --> 00:31:55,707
What's your name, sweetheart?

543
00:32:00,462 --> 00:32:02,297
I'm getting froze out.

544
00:32:04,632 --> 00:32:08,136
- Did you win any money at bingo?
- No.

545
00:32:09,971 --> 00:32:12,640
You shouldn't drink so much.

546
00:32:13,141 --> 00:32:14,184
Pipe down!

547
00:32:14,642 --> 00:32:16,311
Oh, God.

548
00:32:16,978 --> 00:32:19,314
Do you have any idea
how heavy you are?

549
00:32:19,564 --> 00:32:22,108
Do you have any idea
how I don't give a shit?

550
00:32:23,151 --> 00:32:25,320
Let's get something to eat.

551
00:32:29,491 --> 00:32:30,992
Make a left.

552
00:32:31,993 --> 00:32:34,746
Okay. Go here! No, Billy!

553
00:32:34,829 --> 00:32:36,164
It's heavy.

554
00:32:37,165 --> 00:32:40,001
No, push me this way.
Push me this way.

555
00:32:41,169 --> 00:32:43,922
Lisa! Lisa, come look at this.

556
00:32:47,175 --> 00:32:49,678
He's drunk, and he's drinking beer.

557
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:53,181
He got a six-pack.

558
00:32:54,015 --> 00:32:55,183
Push me.

559
00:32:57,352 --> 00:32:58,520
Hello?

560
00:32:59,521 --> 00:33:02,273
- We'd like some food.
- Okay, what you need?

561
00:33:03,191 --> 00:33:04,693
Chickens.

562
00:33:05,193 --> 00:33:06,861
Chicken breast.

563
00:33:07,696 --> 00:33:09,531
Any kind of breast.

564
00:33:10,782 --> 00:33:13,868
- Sir, you need some help?
- Yes, I need some service!

565
00:33:13,952 --> 00:33:15,704
Okay, well, you got to...
We'll get you served,

566
00:33:15,787 --> 00:33:17,455
I need to push you over here.
We'll bring it out to you.

567
00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:18,748
Need to get you away from here.

568
00:33:18,832 --> 00:33:20,458
Let me push you over
to the side, okay?

569
00:33:20,542 --> 00:33:23,086
Can you let go of the thing there?
I'll push you over to the side.

570
00:33:23,128 --> 00:33:24,421
- Okay, but...
- What do you want?

571
00:33:24,462 --> 00:33:27,632
- Do you guys serve beers?
- No, we don't serve beer.

572
00:33:27,716 --> 00:33:31,136
- How about whiskey?
- No, we don't have whiskey, either.

573
00:33:31,219 --> 00:33:34,723
Sir, what do you have
that's good in there for a hangover?

574
00:33:34,973 --> 00:33:37,809
To eat?
I mean, greasy food is always good.

575
00:33:37,892 --> 00:33:40,395
But a hangover? Sleep.
He got to sleep it off.

576
00:33:40,645 --> 00:33:43,940
Man, that girl working the window,
she was nice-looking.

577
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,152
- She was nice-looking?
- Yeah.

578
00:33:47,318 --> 00:33:48,611
Well, you just chill
out here for a minute.

579
00:33:48,695 --> 00:33:49,904
We're gonna see
if we can get you some help.

580
00:33:49,988 --> 00:33:54,951
Okay, we need some chickens
and a big side of poontang.

581
00:33:56,578 --> 00:33:58,580
The poontang? There's some inside.

582
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:01,666
Well, I want some to go.
Go hook that up.

583
00:34:01,916 --> 00:34:04,169
He's stuck on Lisa.

584
00:34:04,252 --> 00:34:05,920
That's what he want.

585
00:34:07,797 --> 00:34:09,215
- Black bush gal?
- Lisa!

586
00:34:09,299 --> 00:34:10,633
He said he wanted poontang.

587
00:34:11,009 --> 00:34:12,302
He'll hook you up!

588
00:34:12,344 --> 00:34:14,387
- What does he want?
- He wants you.

589
00:34:14,471 --> 00:34:16,139
What? No, he don't.

590
00:34:16,181 --> 00:34:17,515
Excuse me, honey.

591
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:20,352
That's what he's hollering.
That's what he wants, Lisa.

592
00:34:20,435 --> 00:34:23,104
Honest to God, strike me dead.

593
00:34:24,522 --> 00:34:25,523
He wants some black bush.

594
00:34:25,607 --> 00:34:26,775
Lisa, that man is 80 years old.

595
00:34:26,816 --> 00:34:29,986
I turned around and I said,
"Did he say what I thought he just said?"

596
00:34:30,028 --> 00:34:31,696
You better go out there.

597
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:34,741
He is 80 years old
in a shopping cart.

598
00:34:34,824 --> 00:34:36,326
Cut the man a break.

599
00:34:47,212 --> 00:34:49,381
<i>Siempre avante.</i>
Know what that means?

600
00:34:49,464 --> 00:34:51,966
- No.
- Onward and forward.

601
00:34:53,301 --> 00:34:57,972
You know, rubber on wheel
is faster than rubber on heel.

602
00:34:58,306 --> 00:34:59,641
That's what Lightnin' Hopkins says.

603
00:34:59,724 --> 00:35:02,227
- You know who Lightnin' Hopkins is?
- No.

604
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:05,522
What about Komodo dragons?
You know what those are?

605
00:35:05,563 --> 00:35:06,731
No.

606
00:35:06,815 --> 00:35:09,818
- You don't know who Johnny Cash is?
- No.

607
00:35:09,984 --> 00:35:11,861
Ask me what the secret of comedy is.

608
00:35:11,986 --> 00:35:14,948
- What is...
- Timing! Get it?

609
00:35:16,658 --> 00:35:17,826
What?

610
00:35:18,743 --> 00:35:20,912
- That's not funny?
- No.

611
00:35:21,037 --> 00:35:22,539
Tough room.

612
00:35:26,668 --> 00:35:28,253
I love this song!

613
00:35:32,507 --> 00:35:33,883
You're kind of...

614
00:35:35,427 --> 00:35:36,594
Weird.

615
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:56,698
Dirty bastard!

616
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,291
You okay?

617
00:36:06,374 --> 00:36:07,876
Oh, God.

618
00:36:11,046 --> 00:36:13,882
- You all right, Grandpa?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

619
00:36:14,132 --> 00:36:16,384
Caught me right in the puss!

620
00:36:16,426 --> 00:36:19,137
You want some ice?
You need me to get some ice for you?

621
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,806
Yeah, maybe some ice.

622
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:24,559
My damn wife put these
in here and it...

623
00:36:28,229 --> 00:36:30,565
Did you see the <i>tuchas</i> on that one?

624
00:36:36,946 --> 00:36:40,116
- Should I get a basket?
- No. We ain't gonna need one.

625
00:36:45,789 --> 00:36:48,458
- You like white bread?
- Yep.

626
00:36:49,042 --> 00:36:50,210
Good.

627
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:56,466
- What are you doing?
- Just go with it.

628
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:02,806
Are we going to get
in trouble for this?

629
00:37:03,306 --> 00:37:05,475
No. If someone says anything,

630
00:37:05,558 --> 00:37:09,396
just tell them that your grandpa's old
and doesn't know what he's doing.

631
00:37:09,479 --> 00:37:12,065
- You want turkey or ham?
- Ham.

632
00:37:12,148 --> 00:37:13,733
Ham?

633
00:37:13,817 --> 00:37:15,068
All right.

634
00:37:18,863 --> 00:37:21,574
Here. Get you a lot.

635
00:37:21,658 --> 00:37:23,410
Let's get some damn mustard.

636
00:37:23,785 --> 00:37:24,786
Here.

637
00:37:26,496 --> 00:37:28,164
- That's a lot of mustard.
- Eat it!

638
00:37:38,425 --> 00:37:40,760
So I eat it quick,
so we don't get caught.

639
00:37:43,263 --> 00:37:45,932
- Sir.
- What's going on?

640
00:37:46,016 --> 00:37:47,934
- What's going on?
- Yes.

641
00:37:48,018 --> 00:37:51,354
You eating everything here.
You don't pay yet.

642
00:37:52,022 --> 00:37:55,025
You eating things here in the store
and you don't pay yet.

643
00:37:55,859 --> 00:37:58,361
- So he took that one.
- Please don't get mad.

644
00:37:58,445 --> 00:37:59,779
He took this.

645
00:37:59,863 --> 00:38:01,197
- And you put it there.
- No.

646
00:38:01,281 --> 00:38:04,451
- Yes, I saw. It's in the camera.
- No.

647
00:38:04,534 --> 00:38:05,952
Okay.

648
00:38:06,036 --> 00:38:07,704
Please don't get mad at my grandpa.

649
00:38:07,746 --> 00:38:09,622
He's old and he doesn't
know what he's doing.

650
00:38:09,706 --> 00:38:11,041
What's going on?

651
00:38:11,207 --> 00:38:13,126
- Where am I?
- You know what he's doing, baby.

652
00:38:13,209 --> 00:38:15,295
You know what he doing
and you doing it with him.

653
00:38:15,378 --> 00:38:17,130
Sometimes he shits himself.

654
00:38:17,213 --> 00:38:19,632
- No. You took that one.
- And sometimes he sits in it like a baby.

655
00:38:19,716 --> 00:38:22,927
I don't shit myself,
you little prick.

656
00:38:23,053 --> 00:38:24,804
- Sometimes he pisses the bed.
- Okay, you opened these...

657
00:38:24,888 --> 00:38:26,389
- Do not!
- Do, too!

658
00:38:26,473 --> 00:38:27,724
- Do not!
- Do, too!

659
00:38:27,766 --> 00:38:30,143
- Do not!
- You opened the ham and you don't pay.

660
00:38:30,226 --> 00:38:31,394
- Can I have his...
- Close the doors.

661
00:38:31,478 --> 00:38:32,562
I'm gonna call the police.

662
00:38:32,645 --> 00:38:34,564
Can he have his chocolate milk
back, please, ma'am?

663
00:38:45,075 --> 00:38:46,868
They won't notice a thing.

664
00:38:47,535 --> 00:38:49,746
That's how it looks
most of the time anyway.

665
00:38:49,788 --> 00:38:51,790
Come on. Come on.

666
00:38:51,873 --> 00:38:53,750
Let's go quick. Let's go quick.

667
00:38:54,209 --> 00:38:55,877
Come on. Let's go this way.

668
00:39:00,715 --> 00:39:02,050
Thank you!

669
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:04,219
Get the hats! Get the hats!

670
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,971
Come on, come on!

671
00:39:07,055 --> 00:39:08,223
Come on!

672
00:39:09,224 --> 00:39:10,892
What are y'all doing?

673
00:39:11,976 --> 00:39:13,812
- It was $3.99!
- Stop!

674
00:39:13,895 --> 00:39:16,064
- Yeah. Come on!
- You're not going anywhere!

675
00:39:16,314 --> 00:39:19,943
- Leave us alone! Leave us alone!
- No. You're not going anywhere.

676
00:39:19,984 --> 00:39:22,320
Hey, Billy, get in! Start it up!

677
00:39:22,404 --> 00:39:23,905
They're going to
take that child away from you.

678
00:39:23,947 --> 00:39:25,240
I wish they would!

679
00:39:25,657 --> 00:39:27,325
- Get back inside!
- I'm sorry.

680
00:39:27,409 --> 00:39:29,703
- Get your ass inside!
- Ma'am, I'm sorry.

681
00:39:29,786 --> 00:39:31,454
You are sorry!
You're sorry as hell!

682
00:39:31,496 --> 00:39:34,290
- No, I'm not gonna...
- You're eating what you stole!

683
00:39:34,332 --> 00:39:37,127
- What am I supposed to do with it?
- You buy it!

684
00:39:37,168 --> 00:39:38,628
- You pay for it.
- If I had money, I would.

685
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:41,965
You had enough money to come in here
and the audacity to try to steal from me.

686
00:39:42,007 --> 00:39:43,508
These are pretty good, by the way.

687
00:39:43,591 --> 00:39:46,052
I don't give a shit. I ought to
stuff it down your damn throat.

688
00:39:46,136 --> 00:39:47,971
- You're very pretty when you're mad.
- You're pissing me off!

689
00:39:48,013 --> 00:39:50,181
- You're very lovely when you're mad.
- You're pissing me off.

690
00:39:57,939 --> 00:39:59,274
All right, come on.

691
00:40:04,529 --> 00:40:05,613
Hi.

692
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:13,788
All right.

693
00:40:18,376 --> 00:40:19,586
Okay.

694
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:23,340
I got her.

695
00:40:26,092 --> 00:40:27,093
Jesus...

696
00:40:30,096 --> 00:40:32,015
Here we go. Jesus.

697
00:40:32,515 --> 00:40:33,558
Oh my goodness.

698
00:40:33,641 --> 00:40:35,268
It's all right. She's already dead.

699
00:40:35,352 --> 00:40:39,314
- What?
- Yeah, she died a few days ago.

700
00:40:40,648 --> 00:40:42,984
We're just bringing her in
'cause it's respectful.

701
00:40:43,026 --> 00:40:45,362
Don't want to leave
her in the trunk.

702
00:40:46,321 --> 00:40:47,322
All right.

703
00:40:47,447 --> 00:40:49,032
Get in there!

704
00:40:49,074 --> 00:40:50,075
Shit.

705
00:40:53,495 --> 00:40:57,332
Grandpa's going out for a walk.
You stay in the room.

706
00:40:59,167 --> 00:41:01,169
See you later, old man.

707
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:03,672
Stay in there, damn it.

708
00:41:04,005 --> 00:41:05,590
My grandson.

709
00:41:05,965 --> 00:41:10,804
Hey, you don't know where any, like,
dance clubs or anything like that are?

710
00:41:11,805 --> 00:41:14,140
Like, with lots of black ladies.

711
00:41:14,474 --> 00:41:16,476
There's one on...

712
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:18,978
Richard Boulevard.

713
00:41:19,062 --> 00:41:20,188
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

714
00:41:20,397 --> 00:41:23,233
- I'm really fond of the black ladies.
- Yeah.

715
00:41:23,316 --> 00:41:26,820
Yeah. They used to call me
Jizzy Gillespie when I was younger.

716
00:41:26,903 --> 00:41:28,405
Yeah?

717
00:41:30,323 --> 00:41:31,825
Hey, get in the room!

718
00:42:09,404 --> 00:42:10,905
Hello. How are you?

719
00:42:14,951 --> 00:42:16,119
Hello, ladies!

720
00:42:16,161 --> 00:42:19,622
- Hey, grandpa, how you doing?
- Good! How you doing, baby?

721
00:42:19,706 --> 00:42:20,874
All right!

722
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:36,139
- Hi, sweetheart. You are nice-looking!
- Thank you!

723
00:42:36,222 --> 00:42:39,059
Can I get a Colt 45, please?

724
00:43:06,002 --> 00:43:07,962
He's got his jim dog out.

725
00:43:09,089 --> 00:43:10,924
That thing's about like that!

726
00:43:17,472 --> 00:43:21,810
Hey, big boy!
Is this one of them stripteaser shows?

727
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,728
Yeah, it's males.

728
00:43:24,437 --> 00:43:29,109
That's perfect, because I like to catch
these women when they're soggy.

729
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:30,944
So you boys do a good job tonight,

730
00:43:31,027 --> 00:43:32,237
- all right?
- Okay.

731
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,072
Get them all hot and bothered,

732
00:43:34,155 --> 00:43:36,783
and I'm gonna try to swoop in
and get me a little.

733
00:43:36,866 --> 00:43:38,034
Okay, okay.

734
00:43:38,118 --> 00:43:40,495
- Are you one of them dancers?
- Yeah, I am.

735
00:43:40,745 --> 00:43:43,164
I bet you got a pretty
big Tootsie Roll, huh?

736
00:43:43,373 --> 00:43:44,624
Man, what the fuck?

737
00:43:45,583 --> 00:43:46,584
What?

738
00:43:47,419 --> 00:43:49,754
Get the fuck away from me, man.

739
00:43:51,006 --> 00:43:52,465
But I mean, if you're a dancer...

740
00:43:52,549 --> 00:43:55,844
I'm sorry, I was just...
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

741
00:43:58,763 --> 00:44:00,807
How are you ladies doing down here?

742
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:03,643
- Fine. How are you?
- Good, good.

743
00:44:03,727 --> 00:44:06,271
I came here alone,
so I'm sorry if I'm bothering you.

744
00:44:06,354 --> 00:44:08,189
What made you come in here?

745
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,567
I don't... I was walking,

746
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:11,735
- down the street...
- Walking?

747
00:44:11,776 --> 00:44:13,445
You weren't walking nowhere!

748
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:16,072
What you gonna do,
watch it or watch us?

749
00:44:16,156 --> 00:44:18,074
I came to watch you girls.

750
00:44:20,326 --> 00:44:22,495
You ladies are gonna
get all worked up,

751
00:44:22,829 --> 00:44:25,790
and then hopefully
old Irving can swoop in there.

752
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,002
- What's your name?
- Irving.

753
00:44:31,087 --> 00:44:33,840
Maybe some of these ladies
will want a serving of Irving,

754
00:44:33,923 --> 00:44:35,175
if you know what I'm saying.

755
00:44:36,176 --> 00:44:38,678
That's right. Thank you.
Thank you, mama!

756
00:44:38,928 --> 00:44:42,265
<i>If you're ready for the next entertainer,
everybody say, "I am!"</i>

757
00:44:42,349 --> 00:44:43,683
I am!

758
00:44:46,353 --> 00:44:47,937
I love chocolate!

759
00:44:49,439 --> 00:44:51,441
He's harder than a horseshoe!

760
00:44:51,858 --> 00:44:53,360
How hard are you?

761
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:56,780
I'm pretty loose right now,
but I could probably get it going.

762
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:59,532
We want to see yours.
We want you to walk the red carpet.

763
00:44:59,783 --> 00:45:00,784
She wants to see mine?

764
00:45:00,867 --> 00:45:02,118
Walk the red carpet.

765
00:45:02,202 --> 00:45:03,787
I'll show her mine right now!

766
00:45:03,828 --> 00:45:05,747
We're gonna make it rain.
Walk the red carpet.

767
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:08,500
I'm gonna go...
I'm going to walk the red carpet.

768
00:45:08,583 --> 00:45:10,418
Yeah, I'm gonna shake it!

769
00:45:17,759 --> 00:45:19,761
<i>I don't know what the
fuck is going on.</i>

770
00:46:03,179 --> 00:46:04,389
What?

771
00:46:56,024 --> 00:46:59,027
Excuse me?
Have you seen my grandpa?

772
00:46:59,361 --> 00:47:00,445
Your grandpa?

773
00:47:00,695 --> 00:47:03,198
I think he's lost.
He's kind of an idiot.

774
00:47:03,448 --> 00:47:05,200
Why is he an idiot?

775
00:47:06,034 --> 00:47:07,452
'Cause he's lost, duh.

776
00:47:07,702 --> 00:47:08,787
Does he have a cell phone?

777
00:47:09,037 --> 00:47:13,208
He's probably drunk right now.
He went to a strip club last night.

778
00:47:13,875 --> 00:47:17,545
I don't know what to tell you, son.
Oh, gosh.

779
00:47:18,046 --> 00:47:20,382
Excuse me? Excuse me?

780
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:23,385
Screw you.

781
00:47:29,724 --> 00:47:32,060
- Who you looking for?
- I'm looking for my grandpa.

782
00:47:32,394 --> 00:47:34,104
Your grandpa's not here.

783
00:47:34,145 --> 00:47:37,482
- Is he in the Champagne Room?
- There's nobody in there.

784
00:47:37,732 --> 00:47:39,401
- Let me check.
- No.

785
00:47:39,734 --> 00:47:42,237
- Let me just go check.
- I told you.

786
00:47:43,905 --> 00:47:45,907
He's, like, persistent.
He wants to go in there.

787
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:48,576
And he's talking about having
a great time in the Champagne Room

788
00:47:48,618 --> 00:47:50,787
like he's, like, 21.

789
00:47:52,997 --> 00:47:54,040
What's up?

790
00:47:54,124 --> 00:47:56,251
- Is this an adult bookstore?
- Yeah.

791
00:47:56,292 --> 00:47:58,837
- Is my grandpa in here?
- No.

792
00:47:59,254 --> 00:48:00,714
Is there somebody, like...

793
00:48:00,797 --> 00:48:02,674
Is somebody, like,
watching you or something?

794
00:48:02,757 --> 00:48:03,758
No.

795
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,136
Did you get that shirt
at Tramps R Us?

796
00:48:06,302 --> 00:48:07,345
What?

797
00:48:07,429 --> 00:48:10,849
- Did you get that shirt at Tramps R Us?
- No.

798
00:48:11,349 --> 00:48:13,101
- How old are you?
- Eight.

799
00:48:13,435 --> 00:48:15,437
- What's your name?
- Billy.

800
00:48:15,687 --> 00:48:17,022
When did you get here?

801
00:48:17,105 --> 00:48:19,024
You're asking a lot of questions
for a stripper.

802
00:48:19,274 --> 00:48:21,109
- What's your stage name?
- What?

803
00:48:21,192 --> 00:48:22,444
What's your stripper stage name?

804
00:48:22,485 --> 00:48:24,237
I don't have a stage name.
I'm not a stripper.

805
00:48:24,446 --> 00:48:25,697
I'll just call you Cinnamon.

806
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:27,157
- Cinnamon?
- What?

807
00:48:27,198 --> 00:48:30,118
- I look like a stripper?
- Yeah. In a good way.

808
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,786
- In a good way?
- Oh, my...

809
00:48:32,871 --> 00:48:35,582
Why don't you wait on me
and I'm gonna come, like,

810
00:48:35,665 --> 00:48:37,125
take you to whatever
hotel you're at?

811
00:48:37,459 --> 00:48:38,877
You don't need to be out here
by yourself.

812
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,795
You're gonna, like, get hurt.

813
00:48:41,463 --> 00:48:43,715
There's a bunch of crazy people
out here.

814
00:48:44,716 --> 00:48:46,384
Apparently, your
grandpa's one of them.

815
00:48:46,468 --> 00:48:48,386
Bye, Cinnamon. I got to go.

816
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:50,638
No. And I'm not Cinnamon!

817
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:57,979
- How you doing?
- Rough night.

818
00:49:00,982 --> 00:49:03,276
Grandpa! Where have you been?

819
00:49:03,401 --> 00:49:05,236
Not now.

820
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:07,155
I've been worried!

821
00:49:27,759 --> 00:49:30,095
What're we gonna do
with Grandma's body?

822
00:49:31,179 --> 00:49:32,764
I don't know, buddy.

823
00:49:34,182 --> 00:49:36,226
We met with someone
to discuss that,

824
00:49:36,267 --> 00:49:40,522
but your grandma, she wasn't
very cooperative that day.

825
00:49:41,189 --> 00:49:45,694
Just said some nonsense about
throw her off a bridge for all she cares.

826
00:49:55,203 --> 00:49:57,539
You know what a woman likes?

827
00:49:57,872 --> 00:49:59,708
A new fishing rod?

828
00:50:00,208 --> 00:50:01,376
No.

829
00:50:02,043 --> 00:50:03,294
Magic!

830
00:50:04,212 --> 00:50:06,548
I can prove it. You want to see?

831
00:50:06,881 --> 00:50:08,049
- Sure.
- All right.

832
00:50:11,219 --> 00:50:14,180
Hello, ma'am.
You wouldn't flatter an old man

833
00:50:14,264 --> 00:50:16,224
by watching him do a magic trick,
would you?

834
00:50:17,726 --> 00:50:20,395
That's good.
All right, keep your eye on the...

835
00:50:20,729 --> 00:50:23,398
I'm going to make it disappear.

836
00:50:24,899 --> 00:50:26,735
No charge, either.

837
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:30,238
Okay. 'Cause I don't
have any money.

838
00:50:30,488 --> 00:50:32,490
There we go! Where'd it go?

839
00:50:32,741 --> 00:50:34,075
- In your sleeve?
- No.

840
00:50:34,325 --> 00:50:35,994
- What's that on your thumb?
- What?

841
00:50:36,578 --> 00:50:38,747
- Look.
- Will you give me that?

842
00:50:40,582 --> 00:50:43,209
- Why don't you beat it?
- But I want to stay with you.

843
00:50:43,293 --> 00:50:44,627
Why don't you beat it?

844
00:50:45,587 --> 00:50:48,590
Grandpa's got to talk to some tail.

845
00:50:49,382 --> 00:50:50,550
He's...

846
00:50:50,925 --> 00:50:53,928
He's a little cooter stretcher
is what he is.

847
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:56,931
You from this town?

848
00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:58,767
Yeah. Born and raised.

849
00:50:58,850 --> 00:51:01,353
Born and raised.
You're awful pretty. My goodness!

850
00:51:01,436 --> 00:51:02,520
Thank you.

851
00:51:02,771 --> 00:51:05,940
A beautiful young lady like
yourself, I have something for you.

852
00:51:06,191 --> 00:51:07,484
Oh, Lordy.

853
00:51:07,525 --> 00:51:10,862
Here we go. You're so kind.

854
00:51:10,945 --> 00:51:12,530
- There you go.
- Thank you.

855
00:51:12,614 --> 00:51:15,784
Those are for you.
They're specially scented.

856
00:51:15,992 --> 00:51:17,035
I bet.

857
00:51:17,285 --> 00:51:19,954
You got time for an old
man like me, maybe?

858
00:51:20,038 --> 00:51:24,000
We can blow this garmooshky
and go chase around a little.

859
00:51:24,376 --> 00:51:25,752
Not tonight I don't.

860
00:51:25,877 --> 00:51:27,295
- Not tonight?
- No.

861
00:51:28,963 --> 00:51:31,216
You on a lunch break?

862
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:33,718
Yeah.

863
00:51:33,802 --> 00:51:35,929
- You married?
- Yeah.

864
00:51:36,137 --> 00:51:38,139
Oh, boy. "Married" married?

865
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:42,227
"Married" married
to a gun-toting police officer.

866
00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:45,313
- Oh, God! Of all the luck.
- There you go.

867
00:51:48,149 --> 00:51:50,110
- All right, good times.
- See ya.

868
00:51:50,193 --> 00:51:51,194
Bye.

869
00:51:51,319 --> 00:51:53,697
If I had all the money
I spent on poontang,

870
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:55,240
you know what I'd do with it?

871
00:51:55,824 --> 00:51:58,159
- What?
- Spend it on poontang.

872
00:52:00,161 --> 00:52:03,832
One, two, three, four,
I declare a thumb war.

873
00:52:05,208 --> 00:52:08,044
One, two, three,

874
00:52:08,128 --> 00:52:10,422
four, five, six,

875
00:52:10,839 --> 00:52:12,173
seven, eight...

876
00:52:12,424 --> 00:52:14,050
Come on, you're a lefty.
You can be stronger than that.

877
00:52:14,134 --> 00:52:16,094
I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm trying.

878
00:52:16,177 --> 00:52:19,097
It's because you're holding
it so close to the edge.

879
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:20,598
- Hello.
- Hi.

880
00:52:20,682 --> 00:52:23,560
- I see you have met my grandson.
- Yeah.

881
00:52:24,019 --> 00:52:27,188
- My name is Irving.
- I'm Lisa.

882
00:52:27,522 --> 00:52:30,650
- What was your name...
- She's American. You don't have to bow.

883
00:52:30,734 --> 00:52:32,444
- What?
- You have a weird grandpa.

884
00:52:33,695 --> 00:52:35,030
Where'd you go?

885
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,700
You told me to beat it
'cause you were gonna talk to some tail.

886
00:52:41,619 --> 00:52:43,121
I said I... To...

887
00:52:43,538 --> 00:52:46,875
I was going to beat it
to go deliver some mail.

888
00:52:47,208 --> 00:52:48,543
Oh, jeez.

889
00:52:48,877 --> 00:52:51,713
You are hotter
than a Puerto Rican picnic.

890
00:52:51,755 --> 00:52:53,340
Oh, my God, thank you!

891
00:52:54,716 --> 00:52:56,051
- Thank you so much.
- Oh, my goodness!

892
00:52:56,384 --> 00:52:59,387
- You babysit big boys?
- I do, yeah.

893
00:52:59,721 --> 00:53:01,139
I mean big boys like me.

894
00:53:01,348 --> 00:53:02,432
No.

895
00:53:02,515 --> 00:53:04,017
- No?
- Definitely not.

896
00:53:05,393 --> 00:53:06,728
Oh, well.

897
00:53:07,062 --> 00:53:09,064
You win some, you lose some, kid.

898
00:53:10,231 --> 00:53:12,442
- Nice to meet you!
- See you. Bye-bye.

899
00:53:12,484 --> 00:53:13,568
Goodbye.

900
00:53:14,277 --> 00:53:17,238
That was a slower no
than I usually get.

901
00:53:17,739 --> 00:53:20,116
You may be useful after all!

902
00:53:20,158 --> 00:53:22,243
You ever play charades?

903
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:26,748
Excuse me?

904
00:53:27,332 --> 00:53:31,169
My grandpa can't talk that well,
but he says you're very beautiful.

905
00:53:31,586 --> 00:53:32,671
Thank you. Thank you so much.

906
00:53:39,177 --> 00:53:40,929
Okay. I need to go.

907
00:53:41,554 --> 00:53:42,722
I need to go. Oh, my God.

908
00:53:42,806 --> 00:53:44,808
Grandpa wants to know
if you're married!

909
00:53:50,772 --> 00:53:54,526
My grandpa can't talk that well,
but he says you're very beautiful.

910
00:53:58,029 --> 00:53:59,989
How do you know
that's what he said?

911
00:54:10,125 --> 00:54:11,292
What did he say?

912
00:54:11,334 --> 00:54:14,004
He says you make him
feel young again.

913
00:54:15,338 --> 00:54:17,799
Do you know what he's saying,
or are you just making stuff up?

914
00:54:18,299 --> 00:54:19,676
I know what he's saying.

915
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:23,304
- Does he seem crazy to you sometime?
- Yeah.

916
00:54:23,805 --> 00:54:25,140
Excuse me!

917
00:54:25,181 --> 00:54:26,182
Okay.

918
00:54:30,478 --> 00:54:33,481
He wants to know where we can
get a hoagie around here.

919
00:54:34,274 --> 00:54:36,026
A hoagie sandwich.

920
00:54:40,113 --> 00:54:41,614
Hoagie sandwich.

921
00:54:43,616 --> 00:54:44,868
Excuse me.

922
00:54:50,957 --> 00:54:52,625
He says you look like a nice Jew.

923
00:54:54,586 --> 00:54:56,379
No, no, no, no...

924
00:54:59,466 --> 00:55:00,967
He says you have very nice shoes.

925
00:55:01,801 --> 00:55:04,220
- Thank you.
- Yeah, nice.

926
00:55:05,638 --> 00:55:06,681
We're just...

927
00:55:07,015 --> 00:55:08,683
We're just clowning around.

928
00:55:08,725 --> 00:55:12,145
I'm trying to teach him
how to hit on women.

929
00:55:12,228 --> 00:55:15,565
Okay.
I can kind of see what was going on.

930
00:55:15,607 --> 00:55:17,275
- How did he do?
- You did very good.

931
00:55:17,567 --> 00:55:19,569
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

932
00:55:19,652 --> 00:55:22,155
- He's sweet. He's my grandson.
- Okay.

933
00:55:22,238 --> 00:55:23,239
Yes.

934
00:55:23,323 --> 00:55:27,660
He goes to bed around
8:00 p.m. or so. So...

935
00:55:28,828 --> 00:55:30,997
After that, I'm pretty much free.

936
00:55:31,831 --> 00:55:34,167
No, I'm not...
I'm not in the market right now.

937
00:55:34,501 --> 00:55:35,835
You know, I...

938
00:55:36,753 --> 00:55:40,465
I might be too old to stir the gravy,
but I can still lick the spoon,

939
00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:42,425
that's for damn sure.

940
00:55:42,842 --> 00:55:44,010
Well, good luck.

941
00:55:44,177 --> 00:55:45,512
All right.

942
00:55:45,762 --> 00:55:47,097
- We'll be right here.
- Okay.

943
00:55:47,347 --> 00:55:48,848
All right, sweetie.

944
00:55:51,685 --> 00:55:53,103
Good job, buddy.

945
00:55:57,941 --> 00:56:00,819
- Have you kissed a girl yet?
- Yeah.

946
00:56:01,277 --> 00:56:03,738
- Was she your girlfriend?
- Yeah.

947
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:05,949
- How long did you go out with her?
- A day.

948
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:07,992
A day...

949
00:56:08,118 --> 00:56:09,327
A day?

950
00:56:09,577 --> 00:56:12,080
That sounds like
some of my relationships.

951
00:56:12,956 --> 00:56:14,290
Grandpa!

952
00:56:16,584 --> 00:56:18,169
Get that damn thing out of the way!

953
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,804
Jesus Christ!

954
00:56:27,846 --> 00:56:30,640
Why would you put a penguin
right in my driving spot?

955
00:56:31,099 --> 00:56:32,934
In your...
Sir, there's a curb there.

956
00:56:32,976 --> 00:56:34,269
The driveways are there and there.

957
00:56:34,477 --> 00:56:36,980
Look, lady, get off my back!

958
00:56:37,647 --> 00:56:38,982
I'm an old man.

959
00:56:39,024 --> 00:56:41,276
What happened to
"the customer's always right"?

960
00:56:41,818 --> 00:56:43,945
Yeah, but you ain't right
about running over the penguin.

961
00:56:43,987 --> 00:56:46,322
Why would they
put the penguin in my spot?

962
00:56:46,406 --> 00:56:49,617
- You ran over the penguin.
- You put a penguin in my spot!

963
00:56:49,659 --> 00:56:52,829
You ran over the penguin!
What are you talking about?

964
00:56:53,121 --> 00:56:54,497
Well, you don't have to yell at me.

965
00:56:54,789 --> 00:56:55,832
Can I get out?

966
00:56:56,124 --> 00:56:57,625
Stay in the car, Billy.

967
00:56:58,501 --> 00:57:00,003
And watch this.

968
00:57:01,338 --> 00:57:03,173
You can't... Look, buddy.
You're not going anywhere.

969
00:57:03,214 --> 00:57:04,966
You're fixing the thing.
That's all I'm telling you.

970
00:57:05,008 --> 00:57:06,343
I'm going to eat.

971
00:57:06,551 --> 00:57:07,886
You're not going anywhere.

972
00:57:08,136 --> 00:57:10,805
- Watch out for the penguin, sir!
- No, I see it.

973
00:57:10,847 --> 00:57:12,182
You already hit the penguin.

974
00:57:12,515 --> 00:57:15,352
Listen to me, you're going
to fix that penguin, bro.

975
00:57:16,519 --> 00:57:18,980
Whether you like it or not,
believe me, you're gonna fix it.

976
00:57:19,022 --> 00:57:20,023
Nope.

977
00:57:22,025 --> 00:57:24,861
I mean, if I was fixing it,
you'd see me fixing it, but...

978
00:57:26,029 --> 00:57:27,572
I'm not fixing it.

979
00:57:36,873 --> 00:57:38,833
Did you notice how I
wasn't fixing it?

980
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,419
- I'm about to bust your ass.
- Over a penguin?

981
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:49,177
Fucking leave the
penguin alone, bro.

982
00:57:52,889 --> 00:57:56,393
I'm about to whip you, motherfucker.
Up your ass, bro.

983
00:58:01,523 --> 00:58:04,025
That looks like
the camel toe in your pants!

984
00:58:06,569 --> 00:58:09,030
Get it? I said you had a vagina.

985
00:58:09,072 --> 00:58:10,740
That's a vagina reference.

986
00:58:11,408 --> 00:58:13,743
You're gonna fix this fucking
penguin, whether you like it or not.

987
00:58:13,785 --> 00:58:15,412
- You understand?
- One second. I'm gonna say it...

988
00:58:15,453 --> 00:58:16,871
Am not, am not!

989
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:19,082
- You're gonna fix this fucking thing.
- Nope, nope.

990
00:58:19,207 --> 00:58:22,043
You gotta ask yourself,
"What leverage do I have?"

991
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:24,754
Not much!

992
00:58:24,921 --> 00:58:27,590
You're a fucking jerkoff,
you know that?

993
00:58:29,592 --> 00:58:32,095
- "You're gonna fix that penguin!"
- "No, you're gonna fix it!"

994
00:58:32,137 --> 00:58:34,472
- "You're gonna fix it!"
- "No, you're gonna!"

995
00:58:35,765 --> 00:58:38,476
- Table for two?
- Yeah.

996
00:58:38,727 --> 00:58:40,103
Okay. Right this way.

997
00:58:40,228 --> 00:58:42,230
I'd like to fix her penguin.

998
00:58:42,439 --> 00:58:44,899
Want to see how red
I can get my face?

999
00:58:45,108 --> 00:58:46,735
Yeah.

1000
00:58:53,116 --> 00:58:54,951
Stop, stop, stop!

1001
00:58:56,286 --> 00:58:59,956
Oh, my God.
That was redder than an ape's ass.

1002
00:59:02,125 --> 00:59:04,294
- Watch your mouth.
- Sorry.

1003
00:59:04,627 --> 00:59:06,463
That was redder than
an ape's <i>tuchas.</i>

1004
00:59:11,593 --> 00:59:13,303
Do you like a lot of milk?

1005
00:59:13,636 --> 00:59:15,472
Oh, boy, do I!

1006
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:19,476
I like chocolate milk sometimes.

1007
00:59:19,809 --> 00:59:21,644
Yeah,
Grandpa's got a taste for that, too.

1008
00:59:21,686 --> 00:59:22,687
Yeah.

1009
00:59:22,979 --> 00:59:25,273
He used to have a big taste for it.

1010
00:59:26,483 --> 00:59:28,318
Why doesn't my mom like me?

1011
00:59:31,821 --> 00:59:33,323
Your mom likes you, buddy.

1012
00:59:33,990 --> 00:59:36,159
Then why'd she run away from me?

1013
00:59:36,493 --> 00:59:37,494
Well...

1014
00:59:39,162 --> 00:59:41,831
Mom's got to go away
for a little bit,

1015
00:59:41,873 --> 00:59:46,336
and so I'm taking you to your dad
so he can look after you.

1016
00:59:49,005 --> 00:59:51,132
But I don't really like my dad.

1017
00:59:52,676 --> 00:59:54,844
Yeah, I don't like him much either,
buddy.

1018
00:59:59,182 --> 01:00:04,020
I think all this bacon
is getting to Grandpa.

1019
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:19,744
Did you just toot, Grandpa?

1020
01:00:19,828 --> 01:00:21,663
That was a church house creeper.

1021
01:00:21,871 --> 01:00:23,039
I think I got one.

1022
01:00:27,293 --> 01:00:29,295
I think you need to
clean out your shorts.

1023
01:00:32,382 --> 01:00:33,717
Beat that.

1024
01:00:34,050 --> 01:00:36,052
Grandpa's tummy's hurting.

1025
01:00:36,386 --> 01:00:37,721
Let it out.

1026
01:00:40,557 --> 01:00:42,726
Try this one on for size.

1027
01:00:51,609 --> 01:00:54,362
- Oh, God.
- Grandpa, you sharted!

1028
01:00:55,697 --> 01:00:56,698
I'm so sorry.

1029
01:00:56,740 --> 01:00:57,741
Are you okay?

1030
01:00:57,907 --> 01:00:58,992
Oh, my...

1031
01:01:00,076 --> 01:01:01,244
Oh, my God.

1032
01:01:01,578 --> 01:01:04,914
I'm sorry, ladies.
Don't look back there. I'm so sorry.

1033
01:01:07,042 --> 01:01:08,543
Oh, God, that's...

1034
01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:15,091
Let's go, buddy.

1035
01:01:15,759 --> 01:01:16,760
Oh, no.

1036
01:01:20,096 --> 01:01:24,392
That guy stood up on the chair part
and pooped on the wall.

1037
01:01:24,434 --> 01:01:26,269
- He what?
- And he pooped on the wall.

1038
01:01:33,902 --> 01:01:37,113
Good shot. Good...
Take it again. Take it again.

1039
01:01:39,616 --> 01:01:40,950
Jesus.

1040
01:01:43,787 --> 01:01:46,289
All right. You want some of this?

1041
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:49,125
Why can't I just stay with you
instead of my dad?

1042
01:01:49,459 --> 01:01:52,587
- 'Cause that's not the plan.
- We can change the plan.

1043
01:02:00,804 --> 01:02:06,309
How about this? If I make this shot,
I get to stay with you instead of my dad.

1044
01:02:06,351 --> 01:02:07,352
All right.

1045
01:02:08,978 --> 01:02:11,147
Get that out of here!

1046
01:02:16,152 --> 01:02:20,115
How about we become tuna fishermen
and then move to Japan?

1047
01:02:20,323 --> 01:02:21,825
Oh, boy.

1048
01:02:23,326 --> 01:02:28,206
We'll get a fish market and then
we sell all tuna and we'll be billionaires.

1049
01:02:28,498 --> 01:02:31,626
There is lots of tuna in
Japan, that's for sure!

1050
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:35,505
That's the best idea
I heard in years, son.

1051
01:02:39,175 --> 01:02:41,344
Do you like to fish, old man?

1052
01:02:42,012 --> 01:02:45,849
I used to like to fish a lot,
but that was before.

1053
01:02:46,182 --> 01:02:47,684
Before what?

1054
01:02:50,186 --> 01:02:55,191
Before a dark day
when I caught my very own Moby Dick.

1055
01:03:02,866 --> 01:03:04,034
Jesus!

1056
01:03:10,707 --> 01:03:11,875
Shit!

1057
01:03:12,709 --> 01:03:14,711
Oh, Lordy! Lordy!

1058
01:03:21,217 --> 01:03:22,552
A little help!

1059
01:03:25,597 --> 01:03:26,598
Man!

1060
01:03:28,558 --> 01:03:30,727
Check out the nine iron on this one.

1061
01:03:32,062 --> 01:03:33,063
Oh, God.

1062
01:03:33,229 --> 01:03:34,564
Shit.

1063
01:03:34,856 --> 01:03:37,567
What is that? What is that?

1064
01:03:37,734 --> 01:03:42,072
- It's a large-nose carpet croaker!
- Yeah. Okay.

1065
01:03:50,914 --> 01:03:52,499
He's got his dick in his mouth!

1066
01:03:55,251 --> 01:03:58,421
After that,
I never ate fish sticks again.

1067
01:04:01,591 --> 01:04:02,926
Grandpa, I'm hungry.

1068
01:04:03,218 --> 01:04:06,221
You know what?
I may have a solution.

1069
01:04:15,063 --> 01:04:17,941
- Are you sure this is a good idea?
- Of course it is.

1070
01:04:17,982 --> 01:04:21,277
You can get away with most anything,
all you got to do is try.

1071
01:04:21,611 --> 01:04:23,113
Follow my lead.

1072
01:04:31,454 --> 01:04:34,249
Okay, folks, can we get a
picture here with everyone?

1073
01:04:34,290 --> 01:04:37,460
Can everybody back up
on this side just a little bit?

1074
01:04:37,585 --> 01:04:39,295
Just kinda take a couple steps back.

1075
01:04:40,797 --> 01:04:43,299
Keep going, just a little bit more.

1076
01:04:44,843 --> 01:04:46,302
Look at this.

1077
01:04:46,970 --> 01:04:48,972
This is lovely!

1078
01:04:53,977 --> 01:04:56,354
- Look at that. It's pretty, right?
- Yeah.

1079
01:04:56,479 --> 01:04:58,189
Sir, can you back up out of the way?

1080
01:04:58,314 --> 01:05:00,025
I'm trying to take a picture.

1081
01:05:09,784 --> 01:05:11,870
- Help him!
- Are you okay, Grandpa?

1082
01:05:19,753 --> 01:05:21,254
Oh, my God!

1083
01:05:22,672 --> 01:05:24,132
Should we call 911?

1084
01:05:24,382 --> 01:05:25,800
Who pushed me?

1085
01:05:26,176 --> 01:05:28,011
I don't know. I think you just fell.

1086
01:05:45,028 --> 01:05:47,030
Here. Got you some breakfast.

1087
01:05:47,364 --> 01:05:48,698
Sweet!

1088
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:50,241
All right.

1089
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,711
- What's today?
- Saturday.

1090
01:06:03,046 --> 01:06:05,340
Bet we could've
stirred up some trouble here.

1091
01:06:06,341 --> 01:06:09,844
Damn shame I got to
drop you at your dad's tomorrow.

1092
01:06:10,053 --> 01:06:13,014
The hell with it!
Let's go have some fun.

1093
01:06:18,395 --> 01:06:20,563
Would you like to
see a magic trick?

1094
01:06:20,855 --> 01:06:23,566
I need a $20 bill as a prop.

1095
01:06:23,608 --> 01:06:25,360
And I'll give it right back to you.

1096
01:06:29,572 --> 01:06:32,242
Grab the stuff...
Let's beat it, kid!

1097
01:06:32,867 --> 01:06:34,202
Come on! Come on!

1098
01:06:34,411 --> 01:06:36,746
What are you doing?
What are you waiting on? Come on!

1099
01:06:38,415 --> 01:06:40,083
Grandpa, the car!

1100
01:06:46,089 --> 01:06:48,091
Have a sip of beer with Grandpa.

1101
01:06:54,097 --> 01:06:55,890
'Cause he should not be drinking.

1102
01:06:56,266 --> 01:06:58,268
Grandpa, I'm fucking wasted.

1103
01:07:02,772 --> 01:07:04,482
What the hell was that?

1104
01:07:07,944 --> 01:07:09,904
You little cooter stretcher!

1105
01:07:10,113 --> 01:07:11,114
No!

1106
01:07:11,197 --> 01:07:13,199
Wedgie, wedgie!

1107
01:07:20,790 --> 01:07:22,459
What's on your shirt?

1108
01:07:25,962 --> 01:07:27,464
Damn it.

1109
01:07:28,298 --> 01:07:32,093
Okay, my little wingman,
why don't you take the big bed tonight?

1110
01:07:32,135 --> 01:07:33,803
- You deserve it.
- Thank you, Grandpa!

1111
01:07:36,973 --> 01:07:39,851
Settle down, now.
We got to get some sleep.

1112
01:07:39,976 --> 01:07:41,770
We got Raleigh tomorrow.

1113
01:07:42,979 --> 01:07:44,481
Night, Billy.

1114
01:07:44,814 --> 01:07:48,818
- Grandpa, can we go fishing tomorrow?
- Maybe.

1115
01:07:49,152 --> 01:07:50,320
Promise?

1116
01:07:51,654 --> 01:07:53,948
Sure, I promise maybe.

1117
01:07:55,825 --> 01:07:58,161
I think I hear a flock of geese!

1118
01:08:01,164 --> 01:08:03,833
Oh, my God,
I think I just shit myself.

1119
01:08:09,673 --> 01:08:11,007
Good night, buddy.

1120
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:39,703
I don't want to go
to my dad, though.

1121
01:08:40,829 --> 01:08:42,497
Well, I...

1122
01:08:42,539 --> 01:08:47,002
You got to. I can't keep you.

1123
01:08:47,711 --> 01:08:51,214
I just can't
do anything with you right now.

1124
01:08:53,049 --> 01:08:57,220
But I'm sure your father
will do the right thing.

1125
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:01,182
My son's grandfather
is dropping him off.

1126
01:09:01,391 --> 01:09:03,393
I ain't seen the boy
in three or four years.

1127
01:09:03,518 --> 01:09:04,894
- So, you know... Yeah.
- Really?

1128
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:07,063
She took him away from me, okay,

1129
01:09:07,147 --> 01:09:09,441
'cause so she could get, you know,
whatever, 'cause she got mad at me.

1130
01:09:09,524 --> 01:09:11,735
Child support.
Child support'll kill you.

1131
01:09:11,776 --> 01:09:14,279
Guess what?
Now I'm getting the child support.

1132
01:09:15,739 --> 01:09:16,865
You got any speed?

1133
01:09:24,039 --> 01:09:25,707
- Hey, man. How you doing?
- Hey, man.

1134
01:09:25,915 --> 01:09:27,625
- I'm Chuck.
- I'm Patrick.

1135
01:09:27,751 --> 01:09:28,752
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1136
01:09:28,877 --> 01:09:30,545
Hey, what's that...

1137
01:09:30,587 --> 01:09:32,130
- Oh, fuck, man.
- What's that, man?

1138
01:09:32,255 --> 01:09:34,257
What's up with the "GOC"?
What's that, man?

1139
01:09:34,341 --> 01:09:35,884
Guardians of the Children, man.

1140
01:09:39,054 --> 01:09:40,805
That's what G.O.C. stands for.

1141
01:09:42,265 --> 01:09:44,768
No shit. Well, what does that mean?

1142
01:09:45,894 --> 01:09:46,895
We're a...

1143
01:09:47,145 --> 01:09:48,897
biker organization...

1144
01:09:49,105 --> 01:09:50,440
Organization, huh?

1145
01:09:50,982 --> 01:09:53,360
and we, we help abused kids, man.

1146
01:09:53,777 --> 01:09:54,944
Come on.

1147
01:10:04,245 --> 01:10:06,081
There's the old prick right now.

1148
01:10:06,623 --> 01:10:08,124
It's about time.

1149
01:10:08,833 --> 01:10:10,168
You get lost?

1150
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:12,128
Hey, Chuck.

1151
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:13,588
Irving.

1152
01:10:13,963 --> 01:10:18,134
Hey, buddy. How you doing, billy goat?
You want to give me a hug?

1153
01:10:19,302 --> 01:10:21,262
- Don't be afraid of me.
- Hey.

1154
01:10:21,304 --> 01:10:24,140
I know
we had our differences in the past,

1155
01:10:25,141 --> 01:10:29,145
but I'm gonna ask you right now
to please take care of this boy.

1156
01:10:29,270 --> 01:10:30,438
He's all I have left.

1157
01:10:31,314 --> 01:10:34,234
Don't come at me
like I'm some kind of asshole.

1158
01:10:34,317 --> 01:10:35,652
Of course I'm gonna take
care of the little shit.

1159
01:10:35,735 --> 01:10:37,404
- He's my kid.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1160
01:10:37,487 --> 01:10:39,030
Just take it down, all right?

1161
01:10:40,156 --> 01:10:43,827
Just surprise me
and don't be a schmuck this time, okay?

1162
01:10:44,828 --> 01:10:45,912
We're all good.

1163
01:10:45,995 --> 01:10:48,164
Come here. Come here, buddy.

1164
01:10:50,417 --> 01:10:53,628
You be a good boy, okay? All right?

1165
01:10:54,170 --> 01:10:57,340
I'm going to be checking
in on you a lot.

1166
01:10:57,841 --> 01:11:02,178
And I'm gonna get word to your mom
that you're with your father now.

1167
01:11:03,179 --> 01:11:06,182
And I'm gonna tell her
all the fun we had,

1168
01:11:06,516 --> 01:11:08,518
and all the cool
things you showed me.

1169
01:11:09,686 --> 01:11:11,688
Grandpa loves you very much.

1170
01:11:12,188 --> 01:11:13,648
Love you, too.

1171
01:11:16,359 --> 01:11:17,360
Good-bye, son.

1172
01:11:17,652 --> 01:11:19,154
Bye, old man.

1173
01:11:24,826 --> 01:11:26,161
Come on, Billy.

1174
01:11:26,703 --> 01:11:28,163
That's enough of that horseshit.

1175
01:11:28,538 --> 01:11:31,041
- Hop up here. There you go.
- Get up here, little man.

1176
01:11:31,207 --> 01:11:32,375
Excuse me.

1177
01:11:34,669 --> 01:11:35,712
Just sit up here.

1178
01:11:35,795 --> 01:11:38,798
Here, take this bag off.
You don't need this.

1179
01:11:51,728 --> 01:11:52,729
How ya doing?

1180
01:11:52,771 --> 01:11:53,772
Yes, sir.

1181
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:55,607
We're the Guardians
of the Children...

1182
01:11:55,982 --> 01:11:57,359
and we take care of kids...

1183
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:58,401
That's good.

1184
01:11:58,485 --> 01:12:00,820
and as long as this boy and
this feller's in there...

1185
01:12:01,112 --> 01:12:03,073
that child will be took care of.

1186
01:12:03,156 --> 01:12:04,616
Thank you very much. I...

1187
01:12:04,699 --> 01:12:05,700
Don't worry about that.

1188
01:12:05,742 --> 01:12:08,703
I'm his grandfather and unfortunately
I have to hand him back now.

1189
01:12:08,870 --> 01:12:10,121
I can see the concern.

1190
01:12:11,831 --> 01:12:13,500
I don't trust him.

1191
01:12:13,958 --> 01:12:16,211
How long does he get
to keep the child?

1192
01:12:16,252 --> 01:12:18,088
Until his mom gets out of jail.

1193
01:12:18,755 --> 01:12:20,423
I'm sorry, sir,
I can't talk about it.

1194
01:12:20,882 --> 01:12:22,759
I understand. Have a good day.

1195
01:12:22,842 --> 01:12:24,177
Please watch him!

1196
01:12:24,469 --> 01:12:25,929
We'll take good care of him.

1197
01:12:41,027 --> 01:12:42,278
What's your name, little feller?

1198
01:12:43,238 --> 01:12:44,280
What's your name?

1199
01:12:44,531 --> 01:12:45,699
Billy.

1200
01:12:45,907 --> 01:12:47,283
Billy, I'm Rick.

1201
01:12:47,325 --> 01:12:48,326
Hi, Rick.

1202
01:12:48,410 --> 01:12:49,661
Nice to meet you, Billy.

1203
01:12:49,744 --> 01:12:51,538
Dad, can we get some food?

1204
01:12:51,621 --> 01:12:53,748
I'll tell you what,
you can have a water.

1205
01:12:54,374 --> 01:12:56,668
Do you want a chicken wing
for the road?

1206
01:12:57,460 --> 01:12:59,295
Please, Dad, I'm hungry.

1207
01:13:00,213 --> 01:13:01,881
You don't need to eat that.
You're...

1208
01:13:03,049 --> 01:13:04,968
No, don't give him that.

1209
01:13:05,051 --> 01:13:07,387
I mean, he needs to lose some weight.
I mean, honestly.

1210
01:13:07,846 --> 01:13:08,972
A chicken leg ain't gonna hurt him.

1211
01:13:09,014 --> 01:13:10,015
Thank you.

1212
01:13:13,852 --> 01:13:15,979
Will you watch the little fat boy?
I gotta go take a piss.

1213
01:13:16,062 --> 01:13:17,147
Don't call him that.

1214
01:14:22,462 --> 01:14:23,963
You got kids?

1215
01:14:24,714 --> 01:14:27,592
- Do they eat like that?
- Yes, they do.

1216
01:14:31,429 --> 01:14:32,430
Billy.

1217
01:14:33,223 --> 01:14:34,849
Let's go fishing.

1218
01:14:35,850 --> 01:14:37,394
Let's go fishing, buddy.

1219
01:14:38,353 --> 01:14:39,688
What are you doing back here?

1220
01:14:39,729 --> 01:14:41,064
- He's going with me.
- Can we?

1221
01:14:41,356 --> 01:14:42,982
Yeah, you're coming with me.

1222
01:14:43,066 --> 01:14:44,693
Yeah, I don't want you with him,
all right?

1223
01:14:44,776 --> 01:14:46,403
No, no. Don't put your hands on him.

1224
01:14:46,528 --> 01:14:48,947
That's my son.
I can put my hand on him if I want to.

1225
01:14:49,072 --> 01:14:50,532
No, don't touch him. You are his...

1226
01:14:50,573 --> 01:14:51,783
- You are a son of a bitch.
- I am his family.

1227
01:14:51,908 --> 01:14:53,076
You've been no father.

1228
01:14:53,118 --> 01:14:54,619
- Yeah? Really?
- Yeah.

1229
01:14:54,703 --> 01:14:55,954
Come on, Billy. Let's go.

1230
01:14:56,037 --> 01:14:57,414
Just stay right there!
Don't listen...

1231
01:14:57,497 --> 01:14:59,165
Hey, he's staying right here.

1232
01:14:59,249 --> 01:15:01,084
- Come here, buddy.
- No, no, no. He's staying here.

1233
01:15:01,209 --> 01:15:02,377
- Back off!
- You back off!

1234
01:15:02,419 --> 01:15:04,921
He's not going with you.
He's coming with me.

1235
01:15:05,255 --> 01:15:07,215
- Do you understand?
- No, no, no.

1236
01:15:07,257 --> 01:15:08,967
- He's coming with...
- This is my meal ticket.

1237
01:15:09,050 --> 01:15:10,635
You're not fit to have him.

1238
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:12,303
- I'm not fit?
- Yeah, you're not fit...

1239
01:15:12,387 --> 01:15:14,389
I'm not fit?
I'll fucking kick your ass!

1240
01:15:14,431 --> 01:15:16,141
- Get out of my face!
- All right, all right!

1241
01:15:19,394 --> 01:15:21,104
- I'll kill you!
- Easy. Easy.

1242
01:15:21,146 --> 01:15:22,647
Settle the hell down, man!

1243
01:15:23,106 --> 01:15:24,399
You ain't going nowhere, buddy.
Stop it.

1244
01:15:24,441 --> 01:15:26,276
You better let go of me, boy.

1245
01:15:26,609 --> 01:15:28,153
- Let me get his bag.
- Take your grandson.

1246
01:15:28,236 --> 01:15:30,613
- Where's my grandson's backpack?
- Okay. He's okay.

1247
01:15:30,780 --> 01:15:32,282
I can't hack it with him!

1248
01:15:32,449 --> 01:15:34,951
There goes my 600 bucks!

1249
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:36,453
What are you talking about, man?

1250
01:15:36,494 --> 01:15:39,164
That kid is my 600 bucks a month!

1251
01:15:39,289 --> 01:15:40,623
Come back here!

1252
01:15:41,291 --> 01:15:43,209
Let me tell you something,
he's more than money.

1253
01:15:43,293 --> 01:15:44,794
He's a hell of a lot
more than money.

1254
01:15:44,878 --> 01:15:45,879
You hear what I'm saying?

1255
01:15:45,962 --> 01:15:47,797
- He's fixing to get hurt out there.
- I hear you, man.

1256
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:49,174
You'll freaking get hurt, brother.

1257
01:15:49,257 --> 01:15:50,633
You ain't gonna kill
nobody, brother.

1258
01:15:50,675 --> 01:15:52,969
Unless you die your damn self
then you better chill out.

1259
01:15:53,094 --> 01:15:54,304
All right, now, all right!

1260
01:15:54,346 --> 01:15:56,181
You looking at a death
angel right now.

1261
01:15:56,639 --> 01:15:58,141
Go ahead and take off.
We'll keep him inside.

1262
01:15:58,266 --> 01:15:59,476
Thank you so much.

1263
01:15:59,601 --> 01:16:02,103
Bye, baby! Have fun, okay?

1264
01:16:02,312 --> 01:16:05,148
- You okay?
- Yeah. You?

1265
01:16:06,524 --> 01:16:07,525
I'm okay.

1266
01:16:12,072 --> 01:16:13,198
Oh, no.

1267
01:16:13,281 --> 01:16:15,283
Oh, shit!

1268
01:16:15,825 --> 01:16:17,660
Sorry about the bikes!

1269
01:16:24,501 --> 01:16:26,878
Did you really think
I was going to leave you?

1270
01:16:26,961 --> 01:16:27,962
Kind of.

1271
01:16:28,004 --> 01:16:29,506
No way!

1272
01:16:30,507 --> 01:16:33,718
Well, what do you want to do now?

1273
01:16:33,802 --> 01:16:35,804
I got an idea.

1274
01:16:41,017 --> 01:16:42,018
Hey, guys.

1275
01:16:42,102 --> 01:16:43,103
- Good evening.
- Hi.

1276
01:16:43,186 --> 01:16:44,771
- How are you?
- Good.

1277
01:16:47,857 --> 01:16:49,150
- All right...
- Wait.

1278
01:16:49,859 --> 01:16:54,823
Now, when we walk in that room,
your name is Lindsey Dill. Okay?

1279
01:16:54,864 --> 01:16:58,868
You're a pretty little girl, so no
farting and no swearing, you got it?

1280
01:16:59,369 --> 01:17:01,663
Let's go win us some money.

1281
01:17:01,705 --> 01:17:03,164
All right. Come on.

1282
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:10,046
Hi. Is it okay if I
interview you guys?

1283
01:17:10,171 --> 01:17:11,715
Doing a behind-the-scenes
video for the pageant.

1284
01:17:11,756 --> 01:17:12,757
Sure.

1285
01:17:13,717 --> 01:17:15,385
Who are you?

1286
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:16,761
Hi. My name's Jill.

1287
01:17:16,886 --> 01:17:18,179
Can I ask you some questions
for our camera?

1288
01:17:18,221 --> 01:17:19,222
Yes.

1289
01:17:19,305 --> 01:17:20,432
Say, "Yes, ma'am"
but don't baby-talk.

1290
01:17:20,515 --> 01:17:22,350
So, how many pageants
have you been in?

1291
01:17:22,392 --> 01:17:25,061
I've probably been in
a thousand pageants.

1292
01:17:25,186 --> 01:17:27,230
And how many of them did you win?

1293
01:17:27,397 --> 01:17:30,066
I won every single one!

1294
01:17:30,567 --> 01:17:32,402
- What?
- Every single one!

1295
01:17:32,736 --> 01:17:35,113
- I'm supposed to talk.
- It's competitive, it's a sport.

1296
01:17:35,196 --> 01:17:37,532
- And my friends...
- And so moms get...

1297
01:17:37,574 --> 01:17:38,783
You know, they get
into this competition

1298
01:17:38,867 --> 01:17:40,118
and if you're going to do it
and do it right...

1299
01:17:40,201 --> 01:17:41,286
What are you doing?

1300
01:17:41,369 --> 01:17:43,788
Stop, now. If you're going
to do it and do it right...

1301
01:17:43,872 --> 01:17:46,458
I mean, you've got to be
willing to be competitive.

1302
01:17:46,541 --> 01:17:47,625
And that's what happens, you know?

1303
01:17:47,709 --> 01:17:49,753
Sometimes I think competition,
just like any other sport,

1304
01:17:49,794 --> 01:17:51,629
gets the best of everybody.

1305
01:17:51,755 --> 01:17:53,298
<i>Well, thank you so much
for being here tonight</i>

1306

<i>at the Carolina Cutie Pies
Young Miss Pageant.</i>

1307
01:17:56,217 --> 01:17:58,595
<i>And because
this is such a special night,</i>

1308
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:00,430
<i>we have a very special
surprise for you.</i>

1309
01:18:00,722 --> 01:18:06,436
<i>Tonight, for the winner,
we're going to give away $5,000!</i>

1310
01:18:09,773 --> 01:18:11,441
<i>$5,000!</i>

1311
01:18:12,776 --> 01:18:14,611
That's crazy!

1312
01:18:19,115 --> 01:18:24,412
<i>But now, we want to get into
our beauty gown competition.</i>

1313
01:18:24,454 --> 01:18:25,705
<i>Are you excited?</i>

1314
01:18:26,122 --> 01:18:27,791
<i>I know. I love it!</i>

1315
01:18:28,833 --> 01:18:29,918
This is so funny!

1316
01:18:29,959 --> 01:18:31,961
<i>Contestant number one,
please come to the stage.</i>

1317
01:18:34,964 --> 01:18:36,800
<i>Looking very beautiful tonight.</i>

1318
01:18:54,150 --> 01:18:57,987
<i>This is contestant number 10,
Lindsey Dill!</i>

1319
01:18:58,488 --> 01:19:03,326
<i>Lindsey has blazing blonde hair
and hazel eyes.</i>

1320
01:19:03,618 --> 01:19:08,998
<i>Her hobbies are football, fishing
and playing with her sock monkey!</i>

1321
01:19:09,332 --> 01:19:11,501
<i>That must be your proud grandpa.</i>

1322
01:19:18,925 --> 01:19:23,138
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
contestant number 10, Lindsey Dill.</i>

1323
01:19:27,642 --> 01:19:29,519
That's my granddaughter.

1324
01:19:49,330 --> 01:19:50,957
<i>Let's give her a hand!</i>

1325
01:19:52,834 --> 01:19:56,546
Your daughter's so precious.
She's so precious... She did really good.

1326
01:19:57,464 --> 01:20:01,217
I don't know if it'll be good enough
for first place, but she did really good.

1327
01:20:01,301 --> 01:20:04,012
...Good Time<i>
by Owl City and Carly Rae Jepsen.</i>

1328
01:20:05,472 --> 01:20:07,390
So, how do you think
the competition's going so far?

1329
01:20:07,474 --> 01:20:08,475
Good.

1330
01:20:08,558 --> 01:20:10,727
Do you think you have
any stiff competition?

1331
01:20:11,102 --> 01:20:12,145
Some...

1332
01:20:12,228 --> 01:20:15,523
one of these girls has
her grandpa here.

1333
01:20:16,232 --> 01:20:17,400
Is that weird?

1334
01:20:17,525 --> 01:20:19,569
We've just never seen it,
so it's different.

1335
01:20:19,903 --> 01:20:22,405
<i>And this is contestant number 10.</i>

1336
01:20:22,739 --> 01:20:24,908
<i>Everyone, Lindsey Dill!</i>

1337

<i>Please bring back my Bonnie to me</i>

1341
01:21:15,208 --> 01:21:16,501
We're locking it up.

1342
01:21:58,960 --> 01:21:59,961
Come on.

1343
01:22:01,171 --> 01:22:02,881
That's a boy?

1344
01:22:03,131 --> 01:22:05,133
Shit. Come on!

1345
01:22:05,842 --> 01:22:08,970
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
let's hear it for Lindsey Dill.</i>

1346
01:22:22,984 --> 01:22:24,986
Grandpa,
what'd you think of my dancing?

1347
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:27,655
I loved your dancing.

1348
01:22:28,073 --> 01:22:32,410
You were Ginger Rogers and Fred
Astaire all rolled into one.

1349
01:22:32,744 --> 01:22:33,912
Gimme five.

1350
01:22:36,664 --> 01:22:39,584
Grandpa, school starts on Tuesday.

1351
01:22:39,668 --> 01:22:41,127
Tuesday?

1352
01:22:41,211 --> 01:22:43,838
Hell, that's when
the ponies start running.

1353
01:22:44,339 --> 01:22:47,342
What do you say
I get you to school on Friday?

1354
01:22:47,550 --> 01:22:48,677
All right!

1355
01:23:02,857 --> 01:23:03,858
All right.

1356
01:23:08,697 --> 01:23:10,573
Does this look like a good spot?

1357
01:23:10,782 --> 01:23:12,951
This looks like as
good a spot as any.

1358
01:23:19,124 --> 01:23:20,458
Here we go!

1359
01:23:23,545 --> 01:23:25,213
Oh, my goodness!

1360
01:23:26,047 --> 01:23:27,549
Thanks, buddy.

1361
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:38,226
- You sure we should do this?
- This is what she wanted.

1362
01:23:39,394 --> 01:23:42,063
You got any final words
for your grandma?

1363
01:23:42,397 --> 01:23:43,565
Yeah.

1364
01:23:44,399 --> 01:23:45,900
Bye, Grandma.

1365
01:23:46,735 --> 01:23:48,069
Bye, Ellie.

1366
01:23:59,914 --> 01:24:01,249
Let's start fishing.

1367
01:24:01,374 --> 01:24:02,751
Let's fish.

1368
01:24:03,168 --> 01:24:04,669
I call black one!

1369
01:24:04,919 --> 01:24:07,589
You got the black one?
Okay, I got the red one.

1370
01:24:09,758 --> 01:24:12,927
- Grandpa, I got to pee-pee.
- You got to pee-pee?

1371
01:24:13,261 --> 01:24:16,765
Well, dangle that little thing
through the railing and let her rip.

1372
01:24:17,015 --> 01:24:20,185
But point it that way
out of respect for your grandmother.

1373
01:24:45,126 --> 01:24:47,671
Man, get the fuck away from me.

1374
01:24:47,712 --> 01:24:48,880
What did I do?

1375
01:24:48,963 --> 01:24:53,051
- Can I get a hug? Dad?
- That wouldn't be appropriate, big guy.

1376
01:24:56,137 --> 01:24:58,848
- He says you have a fat kitty cat.
- Okay.

1377
01:25:00,225 --> 01:25:01,726
- Jiggle my shoulders!
- I tried to do it!

1378
01:25:01,810 --> 01:25:04,479
Jiggle my... Jiggle! Jiggle!

1379
01:25:04,729 --> 01:25:05,897
What does he look like?

1380
01:25:05,980 --> 01:25:12,153
He's got a moustache, big head,
tall, and he smells like old farts.

1381
01:25:13,905 --> 01:25:15,407
Listen, old man.
I ain't fucking young.

1382
01:25:15,490 --> 01:25:18,827
I'm 45 years old.
I'll fucking tune you up. All right?

1383
01:25:19,786 --> 01:25:20,912
Yep.

1384
01:25:20,995 --> 01:25:23,415
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Listen up, listen up!

1385
01:25:23,498 --> 01:25:25,709
The gentleman you just saw in here
was Mr. Johnny Knoxville

1386
01:25:25,750 --> 01:25:28,211
and we are shooting a movie.

1387
01:25:33,550 --> 01:25:36,678
<i>Thank you, everyone,
for putting up with me tonight,</i>

1388
01:25:36,761 --> 01:25:38,430
<i>and thank you for not beating me up.</i>

1389
01:25:38,513 --> 01:25:39,931
- High five!<i>
- High five!</i>

1390
01:25:40,015 --> 01:25:42,017
Why were you wearing a bra?

1391
01:25:42,100 --> 01:25:43,685
"Why were you wearing a bra?"

1392
01:25:43,727 --> 01:25:45,228
For my dance.

1393
01:25:46,438 --> 01:25:48,356
Well, that was inappropriate!

1394
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:49,983
Doris, what did you think?

1395
01:25:50,692 --> 01:25:53,028
My mother's not gonna like this!

1396
01:25:54,362 --> 01:25:57,282
- We're shooting a movie.
- No way!

1397
01:25:57,365 --> 01:26:00,243
- You've got to be kidding me!
- Oh, my God!

1398
01:26:00,326 --> 01:26:03,329
I just did all of that and...
Oh, my God!

1399
01:26:03,538 --> 01:26:06,207
And a rusty trombone for my grandpa.

1400
01:26:06,458 --> 01:26:09,377
- A rusty trombone for your grandpa?
- Yep.

1401
01:26:09,461 --> 01:26:13,465
Well, I need to take your picture to see
if you're on a milk carton somewhere.

1402
01:26:13,548 --> 01:26:15,050
What do you think?

1403
01:26:15,633 --> 01:26:16,801
Don't hurt me!

1404
01:26:16,885 --> 01:26:18,887
Hurt you? I'm 86 years old.

1405
01:26:18,970 --> 01:26:19,971
Don't hurt me!

1406
01:26:25,393 --> 01:26:27,228
Billy! Billy!

1407
01:26:37,739 --> 01:26:39,240
What is a whore?

1408
01:26:39,574 --> 01:26:41,618
Oh, boy.

1409
01:26:42,911 --> 01:26:45,080
Oh, boy, that's a tough one.

1410
01:26:46,414 --> 01:26:48,750
All right, here we go.

1411
01:26:58,593 --> 01:27:00,929
I'm an old prick now.

1412
01:27:01,930 --> 01:27:04,766
Yeah? Get a load of this!

1413
01:27:10,271 --> 01:27:15,026
My mommy loves crack
almost as much as I love fishing.

1414
01:27:15,110 --> 01:27:17,278
I'm sorry, what did you just say?

1415
01:27:25,370 --> 01:27:26,413
Can I help you?

1416
01:27:26,788 --> 01:27:28,957
Talk more like an old man.

1417
01:27:29,290 --> 01:27:31,001
- Me?
- Yes.

1418
01:27:33,128 --> 01:27:35,046
Yeah, he sounds like
Johnny Knoxville.

1419
01:27:38,466 --> 01:27:42,345
I hate this job.
I fucking hate you!

1420
01:27:43,638 --> 01:27:47,475
This is a camera, in there.

1421
01:27:47,726 --> 01:27:49,185
That's a camera.

1422
01:27:49,310 --> 01:27:51,479
I think there's a camera
here somewhere.

1423
01:27:56,860 --> 01:27:59,863
- Talk to that.
- Okay, and when... Hi, how are you?

1424
01:27:59,946 --> 01:28:02,449
Look at me! I look beautiful!

1425
01:28:04,826 --> 01:28:06,494
That's one ugly bitch.

1426
01:28:07,746 --> 01:28:09,456
It's interesting.
Every time I work with these guys,

1427
01:28:09,539 --> 01:28:11,666
I'm either in a casket
or around a casket.

1428
01:28:23,928 --> 01:28:25,597
I like standing here.

1429
01:28:27,182 --> 01:28:28,850
And I like standing here.

1430
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:31,853
But my favorite spot is here.

1431
01:28:32,187 --> 01:28:33,355
- Come on.
- Get away.

1432
01:28:33,605 --> 01:28:38,401
I may be too old to stir the gumbo, but I
can still lick the ladle, that's for sure.

1433
01:28:38,485 --> 01:28:39,652
Oh, my God.

1434
01:28:39,861 --> 01:28:43,365
In my opinion, ladle-licking is more
important than gumbo-stirring anyway.

1435
01:28:43,698 --> 01:28:45,867
I can lick my eyebrows.

1436
01:28:46,117 --> 01:28:47,118
Get out!

1437
01:28:48,745 --> 01:28:49,746
Fuck.

1438
01:28:53,958 --> 01:28:56,628
Oh, my God!

1439
01:29:12,227 --> 01:29:13,561
Are you all right?

1440
01:29:19,401 --> 01:29:21,611
- Okay.
- Oh, man.

1441
01:29:34,082 --> 01:29:35,417
Big finish.

1442
01:29:42,924 --> 01:29:44,467
What's going on here?

1443
01:29:44,509 --> 01:29:45,844
Get out of here, asshole.

1444
01:29:46,094 --> 01:29:48,930
We have to bring in
your stunt double.

1445
01:29:55,603 --> 01:29:57,480
- Thank you.
- You gotta be shittin' me, man!

1446
01:29:57,522 --> 01:29:59,858
I'm sitting there looking,
I'm like, "What is up with this?"

1447
01:29:59,941 --> 01:30:01,151
Are you serious?

1448
01:30:01,192 --> 01:30:03,153
You guys are so sweet
to look after Billy.

1449
01:30:03,194 --> 01:30:04,487
- Oh, my God!
- How are you?

1450
01:30:12,787 --> 01:30:14,039
I'm sorry, Kelman.

1451
01:30:22,297 --> 01:30:25,967
<i>My Bonnie lies over the ocean</i>

1452
01:30:26,968 --> 01:30:31,723
<i>My Bonnie lies over the sea</i>

1453
01:30:31,806 --> 01:30:35,685
