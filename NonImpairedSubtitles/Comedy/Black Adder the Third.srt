1
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,940
Well, Mrs Miggins, at last we can return to sanity.

2
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:45,860
The hustings are over, the bunting is down,
the mad hysteria is at an end.

3
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,260
After the chaos of a general election,
we can return to normal.

4
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,260
Has there been a general election, Mr Blackadder?

5
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,700
- Indeed there has, Mrs Miggins.
- Well, I never heard about it.

6
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,620
- Of course not - you're not eligible to vote.
- Why not?

7
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,460
Because virtually no one is: women, peasants,

8
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,860
chimpanzees, lunatics, Lords...

9
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:12,700
- That's not true, Lord Nelson's got a vote.
- He's got a bost, Baldrick.

10
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:17,700
Marvellous thing, democracy. Look at Manchester:
population, sixty thousand; electoral roll, three.

11
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:24,740
Well, I may have a brain the size of a sultana,
but it hardly seems fair to me.

12
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:29,100
Of course it's not fair and a damn good thing too.
Give the like of Baldrick the vote

13
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,980
and we'll be back to cavorting druids,
death by stoning, and dung for dinner.

14
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:37,020
I'm having dung for dinner tonight.

15
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:42,060
- Who are they electing at these elections?
- The same old shower.

16
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:46,740
Fat Tory landowners who get made MPs
when they reach a certain weight,

17
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:52,500
raving revolutionaries who think that because they
do a day's work they have the right to get paid.

18
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,740
Basically, it's a right old mess.
Toffs at the top, plebs at the bottom,

19
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,980
and me in the middle making a fat pile of cash
out of both of them.

20
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:03,100
You'd better watch out, Mr Blackadder,
things are bound to change.

21
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,740
Not while Pitt the Elder's Prime Minister.

22
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:09,380
He's about as effective as a catflap
in an elephant house.

23
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:15,780
As long as his feet are warm and he gets a nice
cup of tea in the sun before his morning nap,

24
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,940
he doesn't bother anyone
until his potty needs emptying.

25
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,660
(MR SPEAKER):
Honourable members of the House of Commons,

26
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:27,060
I call upon the new Prime Minister of Great Britain
and her empires: Mr William Pitt, the Younger.

27
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:32,340
Mr Speaker, members of the House,
I shall be brief,

28
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:39,020
as I have rather unfortunately become
Prime Minister right in the middle of my exams.

29
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:44,820
I look forward to fulfilling my duty in a manner
of which Nanny would be proud.

30
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,620
I shall introduce legislation to
utterly destroy three enemies of the State.

31
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,660
The first is that evil dictator,
Napoleon Bonaparte.

32
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,020
Here, here!

33
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:02,220
The second is my old geography master,
banana-breath Scrigshanks.

34
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:07,460
But most of all, sirs, I intend to pursue
that utter slob, the Prince of Wales.

35
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,300
Here, here!

36
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:14,140
Why, this year alone,
he has spent 15,000 pounds on banqueting...

37
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,540
Boo! Boo! Boo!

38
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,060
..20,000 pounds on perfume...

39
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,060
Boo!

40
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:27,540
..and, most astonishingly of all,
an astonishing 59,000 pounds on socks!

41
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:33,940
Therefore, my three main policy priorities are:

42
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,460
One, war with France;

43
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:41,780
two, tougher sentences for geography teachers;

44
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:45,740
and three,
a right royal kick up the Prince's backside!

45
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,580
Hurray!

46
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:52,500
I now put upon the leader of the Opposition
to test me on my Latin vocab.

47
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:59,260
Sir, if I may make so bold,
a major crisis has arisen in your affairs.

48
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,380
- Yes, I know, I've been pondering it all morning.
- You have, sir?

49
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,620
Yes - socks! Run out again!

50
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:10,820
Why is it that no matter how many millions of
pairs of socks I buy, I never seem to have any?

51
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,940
Sir, with your forgiveness,
there is another even weightier problem.

52
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,740
They just disappear!

53
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:21,100
You'd think someone was coming in here, stealing
the damn things and then selling them off.

54
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,460
Impossible, sir.
Only you and I have access to your socks.

55
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,820
Yes, yes, you're right.

56
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:36,980
For me, socks are like sex: tons of it about,
but I never seem to get any.

57
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:42,380
If I may return to this very urgent matter.
I read fearful news in this morning's paper.

58
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:46,140
Oh, no. Not another little cat caught up in a tree.

59
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:51,260
No, sir. There's a vote afoot in the new Parliament
to strike you from the Civil List.

60
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,660
Oh, yes, but what are they going to do
about my socks!

61
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,220
If this bill goes through,
you won't have any socks...

62
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:04,580
..or trousers, shirts, waistcoats, or pantaloons.
They're going to bankrupt you.

63
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,940
They can't do that - the public love me!

64
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:13,540
Only the other day, I was out in the street
and they sang, "We hail Prince George!"

65
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:17,620
"We hste Prince George."

66
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,500
- Was it?
- I fear so, sir. However, all is not lost.

67
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,500
Fortunately, the numbers in the Commons
are exactly equal.

68
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,580
If we can get one more MP to support us,
then you're safe.

69
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,420
Hurrah! Any ideas?

70
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,980
Well, yes, sir. There is one man
who might be the ace up our sleeve.

71
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:38,580
A rather crusty, loud-mouthed ace
named Sir Talbot Buxomly.

72
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,340
Never heard of him.

73
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:45,260
That's hardly surprising, sir. Sir Talbot has
the worst attendance record of any MP.

74
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,820
On the one occasion he did enter the House of
Commons, he passed water in the Great Hall,

75
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,980
and then passed out in the Speaker's Chair.

76
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,620
If we can get him to support us,
then we are safe.

77
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:02,540
According to 'Who's Who', his interests include
flogging servants, shooting poor people,

78
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:06,980
and the extension of slavery to anyone
who hasn't got a knighthood.

79
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,140
Excellent!
Sensible policies for a happier Britain!

80
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:15,900
However, if we are to get him to support us,
he will need some sort of incentive.

81
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:19,300
- Anything in mind?
- You could appoint him a High Court judge.

82
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:24,100
- Is he qualified?
- He's a violent, bigoted, mindless old fool.

83
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:27,780
Sounds a bit overqualified...
Well, get him here at once!

84
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:32,700
Certainly, sir. I will return before you can
say "antidisestablishmentarianism".

85
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:37,700
Well, I wouldn't be too sure about that!
Antidistibblincemin...

86
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,780
Antimistilinstid...

87
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,660
Antidistinctly-minty-monetarism..

88
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,620
Your Highness, Sir Talbot Buxomly, MP.

89
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:51,700
Ah, Buxomly! Roaringly splendid to have you here.
How are you, sir?

90
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:57,500
Heartily well, Your Highness. I dined hugely
off a servant before coming to town.

91
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:01,060
- You eat your servants?
- No, sir, I eat offthem.

92
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:05,380
Why should I spend good money on tables
when I have men standing idle?

93
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:08,860
Why, indeed! Now, I dare say
you've heard of Mr Pitt's intentions.

94
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,380
Young scallywag!

95
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,780
- So you don't approve of his plans to abolish me.
- I do not, sir.

96
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:18,020
Damn his eyes! Damn his britches!
Damn his duck pond!

97
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,460
Hurrah for that!

98
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:24,860
I care not a jot that you are the son of
a certified sauerkraut-sucking loon!

99
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:28,020
It minds not me that you dress like a mad parrot

100
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:33,700
and talk like a plate of beans negotiating
their way out of a cow's digestive system.

101
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,220
It is no skin off my rosy nose

102
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:41,660
that there are bits of lemon peel floating down the
Thames that would make better Regents than you.

103
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,820
The fact is, you sre Regent,
appointed by God,

104
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:49,460
and I shall stick by you forever,
though infirmity lay me waste

105
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:53,380
and ill health
curse my every waking moment.

106
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:57,300
Well, good on you, sir.
And don't talk to me about infirmity.

107
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:02,060
Why, sir, you are the hardy stock
that is the core of Britain's greatness.

108
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:07,540
You have the physique of a demigod.
Purple of cheek, and plump of fetlock,

109
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:13,580
the shapely ankle and the well-filled trouser that
tells of a human body in perfect working order.

110
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,580
He's dead, sir.

111
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,900
Dead?

112
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:22,180
- Yes, Your Highness.
- What bad luck, we were rather getting on.

113
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,900
- We must move at once.
- In which direction?

114
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:28,260
Sir Talbot represented the constituency of
Dunny-on-the-Wold,

115
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,660
and, by an extraordinary stroke of luck,
it is a rotten borough.

116
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,700
Really? Is it?

117
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:38,820
Well, lucky, lucky us.

118
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:43,180
Lucky, lucky, luck. Luck-luck...
Lark! Lark!

119
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:47,580
Lark! Lark! Lark! Cluck! Cluck! Cluck!
Lark! Lark! Lark!

120
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:57,220
You don't know what a rotten borough is,
do you, sir?

121
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,660
No.

122
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,980
So what was the chicken impression in aid of?

123
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:06,380
I just didn't want to hurt your feelings.
So, what is a robber button?

124
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:11,740
Rotten borough. A rotten borough, sir, is a
constituency where the owner of the land

125
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,260
corruptly controls both the voters and the MP.

126
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,420
- Good, yes, and a robber button is?
- Could we leave that for a moment?

127
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,780
Dunny-on-the-Wold
is a tuppenny-ha'penny place.

128
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:27,300
Half an acre of sodden marshland
in the Suffolk Fens with an empty town hall on it.

129
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:33,140
Population: three rather mangy cows,
a dachshund named Colin,

130
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:37,100
and a small hen in its late forties.

131
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:42,660
So, no people at all, then?
Apart from Colin.

132
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,940
- Colin is a dog, sir.
- Yes, yes, yes.

133
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:49,260
Only one actual person lives there,
and he is the voter.

134
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,820
- So, what's the plan?
- We must buy Dunny-on-the-Wold at once,

135
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:57,020
and thus control the voter.
I shall need a thousand pounds.

136
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:01,660
A thousand pounds? I thought you said it
was a "tuppenny-ha'penny" place.

137
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:06,100
Yes, sir, the land will cost tuppence ha'penny, but
there are other factors to be considered:

138
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:09,460
Stamp duty, window tax,

139
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:15,300
swamp insurance, hen food, dog biscuits,
cow ointment - the expenses are endless.

140
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:19,140
- Fine, the money's in my desk.
- No, sir, it's in my wallet.

141
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,300
Oh, splendid! No time to lose, eh?

142
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:26,220
My thoughts precisely, sir.
The only question is who to choose as MP.

143
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,180
- Tricky.
- What we need is an utter unknown,

144
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:35,300
yet someone over whom we have complete power.
A man with no mind, with no ideas of his own.

145
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:39,980
One might almost say
a man with no brain.

146
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:43,060
- Any thoughts?
- Yes, Your Highness.

147
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:51,620
- You rang, My Lord?
- Meet the new MP for Dunny-on-the-Wold.

148
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,540
But he's an absolute arsehead!

149
00:10:55,780 --> 00:11:00,900
Precisely, sir. Our slogan shall be:
"A rotten candidate for a rotten borough."

150
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:07,220
Baldrick, I want you to go back to your
kitchen sink and prepare for government.

151
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:14,100
Right. Now all we have to do is fill in this
MP application form.

152
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,660
Name: Baldrick.

153
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,820
- First name?
- I'm not sure.

154
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:23,740
- You must have some idea...
- Well, it might be "Sod off".

155
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,660
What?

156
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:32,780
When I used to play in the gutter, I used to say
to the other snipes, "Hello, my name's Baldrick,"

157
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:36,660
and they'd say,
"Yes, we know. Sod off, Baldrick."

158
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,940
All right... "Mr S. Baldrick."

159
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:47,180
- Now, distinguishing features? None.
- I've got this growth in the middle of my face.

160
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:53,380
That's your nose, Baldrick.
Any history of insanity in the family?

161
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:59,020
Tell you what, I'll cross out the "in".
Any history of ssnity in the family?

162
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,060
"None whatsoever."

163
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,900
- Now, then, criminal record...
- Absolutely not.

164
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:08,620
Come on, Baldrick, you're going to be an MP,
for God's sake!

165
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:12,980
I'll just put "fraud and sexual deviancy".

166
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:16,900
Now, minimum bribe level...

167
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,060
One turnip.

168
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:23,060
Hang on,
I don't want to price myself out of the market.

169
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:28,660
Baldrick, do you have any ambitions in life
apart from the acquisition of turnips?

170
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,020
No.

171
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:33,380
What would you do
if I gave you a thousand pounds?

172
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,540
I'd get a little turnip of my own.

173
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:39,620
What would you do
if I gave you a million pounds?

174
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:43,260
That's different.
I'd get a great big turnip in the country.

175
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,180
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Oh God, I'll get that. Sign here.

176
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,780
Your Highness, Pitt the Younger.

177
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:02,540
Why, hello there, young sabre, m'lad!
I say, here's fun.

178
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:06,860
I've a shiny sixpence here for the clever fellow
who can tell me which hand it's in.

179
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:12,380
Oh, school, school! On half hols, is it?

180
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:17,780
I bet you can't wait to get back and get that bat in
your hand, and give those balls a good walloping.

181
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:21,180
Mr Pitt is the Prime Minister, sir.

182
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,660
Oh, go on! Is he? What, young Snotty here?

183
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:29,100
- I'd rather have a runny nose than a runny brain.
- Eh?

184
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:35,940
Prime Minister, we do have some lovely jelly in
the pantry. I don't know if you'd be interested.

185
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:39,820
Don't patronise me,
you lower middle class yobbo!

186
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,260
What flavour is it?

187
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,140
- Blackcurrant.
- Eeeuughhh!

188
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:48,180
I say, Blackadder, are you sure this is the PM?
Seems like a bit of an oily tick to me.

189
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:53,420
We used to line up four or five of his sort, make
them bend over, and use them as a toast-rack.

190
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:57,060
It doesn't surprise me, sir. I know your sort.

191
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:03,780
Once, it was I who stood in the cold schoolroom,
a hot crumpet burning my cheeks with shame.

192
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:10,580
Since that day, I have been busy every hour
God sends, working to become Prime Minister

193
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,300
and fight sloth and privilege wherever I found it.

194
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,340
I trust you weren't too busy
to remove the crumpet.

195
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:22,180
You will regret this, gentlemen. You think
you can thwart my plans to bankrupt the Prince

196
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:26,580
by fixing the Dunny-on-the-Wold by-election,
but you will be thrashed!

197
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,620
I intend to put up my own brother
as a candidate against you.

198
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:35,780
And which Pitt would this be? Pitt the Toddler?

199
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,940
Pitt the Embryo?

200
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,620
Pitt the Glint in the Milkman's Eye?

201
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,780
Ha!

202
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:48,300
Sirs, as I said to Chancellor Metternich
at the Congress of Strasbourg:

203
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:53,020
"Pooh to you with knobs on!"
We shall meet, sirs, on the hustings.

204
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:57,660
I say, Blackadder, what a ghastly squit!
He's not going to win, is he?

205
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:02,180
No, sir, because, firstly, we shall fight this
campaign on issues, not personalities.

206
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:06,100
Secondly, we shall be
the only fresh thing on the menu.

207
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:09,380
And thirdly, of course, we'll cheat.

208
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:15,220
Good evening and welcome to the
Dunny-on-the-Wold by-election.

209
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:21,460
The turnout has been very good. As a matter of
fact, the voter turned out before breakfast.

210
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:25,220
And I can bring you the
result of our exclusive Exit Poll

211
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:29,260
which produced a 100 % result for...

212
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:33,260
.."mind your own business, you nosy bastard."

213
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,460
(VOICE IN THE CROWD): Mr Hanna, are you going
to talk to any of the candidates?

214
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:42,460
I certainly am, and I can see Prince George,
who is leader of the Adder Party.

215
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:49,740
Prince George, described in his party news sheet
as a "great moral and spiritual leader,"

216
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,940
but described by almost everyone else
as a "fat, flatulent git."

217
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,100
- Prince George, hello.
- Good evening.

218
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:02,140
And good evening, Colin. How do you see
your prospects in this campaign?

219
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:07,100
Well, first, I'd like a word about the disgraceful
circumstances in which this election arose.

220
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:11,380
We paid for this seat, and I think it's a damn
liberty that we should have to stand for it as well.

221
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:16,620
And why is it, that no matter how many pairs of
socks you buy, you never seem to have enough?

222
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,660
Fighting words from the Prince Regent.

223
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:23,580
And now let's have a word from
the Adder Party candidate, Mr S. Baldrick,

224
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:29,620
who so far has not commented on
his policies in this campaign,

225
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:33,780
but with him is his election agent,
Mr E. Blackadder.

226
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:38,380
Well, we in the Adder Party are going to fight
this campaign on issues, not personalities.

227
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:43,140
- Why is that?
- Our candidate doesn't have a personality.

228
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:48,020
- He doesn't say much about the issues, either.
- No, he's got something wrong with his throat.

229
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:51,300
Perhaps he could answer one question.
What does the "S" in his name stand for?

230
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:55,980
- "Sod off".
- Fair enough, none of my business, really.

231
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:01,420
And now it's time, I think, for a result,
and tension is running very high here.

232
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:06,100
Mr Blackadder assures me that this will be
the first honest vote ever in a rotten borough.

233
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:10,500
And I think we all hope for a result
which reflects the real needs of the constituency.

234
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:15,260
And behind me I can just see the Returning
Officer moving to the front of the platform.

235
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,540
As the Acting Returning Officer
for Dunny-on-the-Wold...

236
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:22,620
The Acting Returning Officer,
Mr E. Blackadder, of course.

237
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:25,900
And we're all very grateful
that he stepped in at the last minute,

238
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:31,620
when the previous Returning Officer accidently
stabbed himself in the stomach while shaving.

239
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:38,100
I now announce the number of votes cast as
follows: Brigadier General Horace Bolsom...

240
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:42,180
(HANNA): Keep-Royalty-White-Rst-
Catching-And-Safe-Sewage-Residents Party...

241
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,060
No votes.

242
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,500
Ivor "Jest ye not madam" Biggun...

243
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:54,820
(HANNA): Standing-At-The-Back-Dressed-
Stupidly-And-Looking-Stupid Party...

244
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,620
No votes.

245
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,500
- Pitt, the Even Younger...
- (HANNA): Whig...

246
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:10,140
- No votes.
- (HANNA): Oh, there's s shock.

247
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:14,260
- Mr S. Baldrick...
-(HANNA): Adder Party...

248
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,820
16,472.

249
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,180
(APPLAUSE AND CHEERING)

250
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:26,900
And there you have it: victory for the Adder Party,
a sensational swing against the Whigs.

251
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:31,620
I'll just try to get a final word with some of the
candidates as they come up from the stage.

252
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,940
Master William Pitt the Even Younger,
are you disappointed?

253
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:40,300
Yes! I'm horrified! I smeared my opponent,
bribed the press to be on my side,

254
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,740
and threatened to torture the electorate if we lost.

255
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:45,620
I fail to see
what more a decent politician could have done.

256
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,660
Ivor Biggun, no votes at all for the

257
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,460
Standing-At-The-Back-
Dressed-Stupidly-And-Looking-Stupid Party.

258
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,060
- Are you disappointed?
- No, not really, no...

259
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,020
I always say,
"If you can't laugh, what can you do?"

260
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,820
Take up politics, perhaps.
Has your party got any policies?

261
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:08,100
Oh yes, certainly! We're for the compulsory
serving of asparagus at breakfast,

262
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:11,620
free corsets for the under-5's,
and the abolition of slavery.

263
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:15,180
Many moderate people
would respect your stand on asparagus,

264
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:18,620
but what about this extremist nonsense
about abolishing slavery?

265
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:22,620
Oh, we just put that in for a joke!
See you next year!

266
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:28,660
And now, finally, a word with the man who is at
the centre of this by-election mystery:

267
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:34,820
the voter himself.
And his name is Mr E. Bla...

268
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:39,540
Mr Blackadder, you are the only voter
in this rotten borough.

269
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,900
Yes, that's right.

270
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,900
- How long have you lived in this constituency?
- Since Wednesday morning.

271
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:49,140
I took over from the previous electorate
when he, very sadly,

272
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:53,500
accidently brutally cut his head off
while combing his hair.

273
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:58,700
One voter, 16,472 votes...

274
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,620
- A slight anomaly?
- Not really, Mr Hanna.

275
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:07,420
You see, Baldrick may look like a monkey who's
been put in a suit and then strategically shaved,

276
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,340
but he is a brilliant politician.

277
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:14,580
The number of votes I cast is simply a reflection
of how firmly I believe in his policies.

278
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:19,740
Well, that's excellent. That's all for me -
another great day for democracy in our country.

279
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:25,420
Vincent Hanna, Country Gentleman's Pig
Fertilizer Gazette, Dunny-on-the-Wold.

280
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:29,620
We are reprieved. It is a triumph
for stupidity over common sense.

281
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:33,900
- Thank you very much.
- As a reward, Baldrick, take a short holiday.

282
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,860
Did you enjoy it? Right.

283
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:41,980
(MR SPEAKER): Will the honourable Members
please cast their votes, 'aye' or 'nay',

284
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:45,900
for the striking of the Prince
Regent off the Civil List.

285
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,740
Excuse me...

286
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,900
Excuse me...

287
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,340
Excuse me!

288
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:54,980
- Hello, little chappie. Are you a new bug?
- Yeah, I don't know anyone here.

289
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,900
I support the Prince and I don't know how to vote.

290
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:01,900
We can soon change all of that, can't we?
Come along with me.

291
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,700
Oh, thanks.

292
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,940
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

293
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:12,460
Well, well, well,
if it isn't the Lord Privy Toast-Rack.

294
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,420
Pull up a muffin, sit yourself down.

295
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:20,260
- You don't like me, do you, Mr Blackadder?
- Well, nobody likes a loser.

296
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:24,260
- Then that's why nobody likes you.
- What?

297
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:28,060
You lost the vote.
Your monkey obligingly voted for us.

298
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,340
Oh God, no.

299
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:35,700
If you want something done properly,
kill Baldrick before you start.

300
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:40,380
You're beaten, Oik! And you and your disgusting
master have twenty-four hours to get out.

301
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:44,100
Twenty-four hours is a long time in politics.
Good day.

302
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:47,620
There is just one thing before I go.

303
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:53,780
I've got this sort of downy hair developing
on my chest, is that normal?

304
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:57,020
Also, I get so lonely and confused.

305
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:00,420
I've written a poem about it,
maybe you'll understand.

306
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:05,380
- "Why do nice girls hate me? Why..."
- Get out, you nauseating adolescent!

307
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,980
Piss off!

308
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:18,980
How could I have been so stupid?
Goodbye, Millionaire's Row.

309
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:26,660
Hello, Room 12 of the Budley Salterton Twilight
Rest Home for the Terminally Short of Cash!

310
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:30,180
And to think you once dreamed
you'd end up in the House of Lords.

311
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,540
- What?
- The House of Lords.

312
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:36,900
I'd forgotten about the House of Lords!
The Lords will never let the bill through.

313
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,900
Every man-jack of them will be behind the Prince.

314
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,380
- Right, take Baldrick off the spit.
- Hurrah...

315
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:50,020
I've got a plan so cunning you could put a
tail on it and call it a weasel.

316
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,660
Da-daa!

317
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,580
(HUMS TRIUMPHANTLY)

318
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,980
Oi, tally-ho, Blackadder!

319
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:01,980
You look as happy as a man who thought
a cat had done its business on his pie,

320
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:05,300
but it turned out to be an extra big blackberry.

321
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:10,300
- Did our plan go well?
- Excellently, sir.

322
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:13,020
Order a thousand pairs of finest cotton socks.

323
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,820
Take out the drawings
for that beach hut at Brighton.

324
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:19,700
- Hurrah!
- There was, however, one slight...

325
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,540
(COUGHS)
..hiccup.

326
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,500
Cough I think you mean.

327
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:29,780
No, sir, hiccup.

328
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:33,940
The motion about your impoverishment
has now moved on to the House of Lords.

329
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:38,340
Bravo! Well, no worry there, then.
Every man-jack of them will be behind me.

330
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:42,140
Ah, would that were so, Your Highness.
These are treacherous times.

331
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,780
- Are they?
- Yes.

332
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:48,500
It might be wise to appoint a new Lord,
to make sure the old Lords vote the right way.

333
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:51,980
Good thought. New Lord...

334
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:56,780
- Any idea who?
- Well, sir, one name does leap to mind.

335
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,300
- Does it?
- Yes, sir.

336
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:03,180
You couldn't make it leap any higher, could you?

337
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:06,620
A young man in your service, sir,
who has done sterling work

338
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:10,860
matching the political machinations
of the evil Pitt.

339
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:17,220
Ah, of course! Blackadder, oh,
how can I ever thank you enough?

340
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,900
It might also be worth bribing a few Lords,

341
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:23,060
just to make sure they vote
the way their consciences tell them.

342
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:27,460
- How many should we bribe?
- Oh, I think three hundred, to be sure,

343
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,420
at a thousand pounds each.

344
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:34,940
- Three hundred thousand pounds?
- Four hundred thousand, I think you'll find, sir.

345
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:41,740
Yes, you're right. Well, thank God
I've got you to advise me, Bladder.

346
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,140
Just remind me, what do I have to do
to appoint this Lord chappie?

347
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:51,100
Oh, it's very simple, sir. You put on
your robes of State, he puts on his,

348
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:55,740
then you sign the Document of Ennoblement
and dispatch him at once to the House of Lords.

349
00:24:55,980 --> 00:25:00,860
- Excellent! I shall change immediately.
- And so, sir, shall I.

350
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:09,380
Voilà, Mrs Miggins. My robes of State.
A thousand pounds well spent, I think.

351
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:13,180
Oh, very nice!

352
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:16,380
Oh, it's real cat, isn't it?

353
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:20,580
This is not cat, Mrs Miggins.
This is finest, leather-trimmed ermine

354
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,020
with gold medallion accessories.

355
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:26,100
Oh, go on, Mr Blackadder, it's cat.

356
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:29,940
Oh, look, they've left the little collars on.

357
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:38,020
"Mr Frisky. If found, please return to Emma
Hamilton, Marine Parade, Portsmouth."

358
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:42,820
Oh, God! Ah, well, who cares about a dead cat
now that I'm a fat cat.

359
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:48,180
- You're full of yourself today, Mr B!
- Which is more than can be said for Mr Frisky.

360
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,660
My Lord.

361
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:55,060
- My Lords.
- I'm sorry, sir?

362
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,980
My Lords.
There is more than one Lord in the vicinity.

363
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,580
Well, yes...

364
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:04,140
Will you please welcome His Grace,
The Lord Baldrick!

365
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:18,060
You made Baldrick a Lord?

366
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:21,140
Well, yes.
"One who has recently done sterling work,

367
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:25,300
matching the political machinations
of the evil Pitt." Good old Lord Baldrick.

368
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:29,100
It's alright, Blackadder,
you don't have to curtsey or anything.

369
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:33,900
- Might I let loose a short, violent exclamation?
- Certainly.

370
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,860
Damn! Thank you, sir.

371
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:40,260
I say, that's a bit of a strange get-up
you've got there, isn't it, Blackadder?

372
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,660
Yes, I'm just off to a fancy dress party.

373
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,660
I'm going as Lady Hamilton's pussy.

374
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:56,780
There's just one question, sir, about the
four hundred thousand to influence the Lords.

375
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,940
Ah, yes, I gave that to Lord Baldrick.

376
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,700
Sir, might I be permitted
to take Lord Baldrick downstairs

377
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:07,820
to give him some instruction
in his lordly duties?

378
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,980
I think that's a splendid idea.

379
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:13,140
This way, My Lord.

380
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:21,620
Give me the bloody money, Baldrick,
or you're dead!

381
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:24,260
"Give me the bloody money, Baldrick,
or you're dead, My Lord!"

382
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:29,460
Just do it, Baldrick!
Otherwise, I shall further ennoble you

383
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:33,220
by knighting you
rather clumsily with this meat cleaver.

384
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,340
- I haven't got it.
- What?

385
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:38,460
- I spent it.
- You spent it?

386
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:43,540
What could you
possibly spend 400,000 pounds on?

387
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,820
Oh, no...

388
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,540
Oh, God, don't tell me.

389
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:54,220
My dream turnip.

390
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:59,900
Baldrick, how did you manage to find a turnip
that cost 400,000 pounds?

391
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,500
Well, I had to haggle.

392
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:09,100
This is the worst moment of my entire life.

393
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:14,100
I spent my last penny on a catskin windcheater,

394
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,820
and I've just broken a priceless turnip.

395
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,260
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

396
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:25,340
And now I'm about to be viciously slaughtered
by a naked Tunisian sock merchant.

397
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:28,020
And all I can say, Baldrick, is this:

398
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,900
It's the last time I dabble in politics!
