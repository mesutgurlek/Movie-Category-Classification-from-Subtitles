1
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:44,944
Ha, ha, ha.
Home sweet home.

2
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,914
Thanks, Cochise.

3
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:11,662
No, you fucking idiot! I've worked
at a restaurant my whoIe Iife.

4
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:24,916
Shit! It gonna be
that kind of a party,

5
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:27,316
I'm gonna stick my dick
in the mashed potatoes!

6
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:39,257
- Guess who. Hi, Dean. It's Mom.
- Ah, shit.

7
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:41,128
I know you're not gonna
forget lunch with me,

8
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:44,328
but I thought I'd call
just to make sure.

9
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:47,565
Oh, hey.

10
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:49,835
I forgot you were here.

11
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,537
Yeah, I know. I know.

12
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:56,945
- What?
- Nothing.

13
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,249
I'II see you at work, okay?

14
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,057
Hey, there, Natasha.
How's my favorite minor doing today?

15
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,186
Hung over.
I got so shitty Iast night.

16
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:20,664
On a schooI night?
Kids today.

17
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:24,362
I must say, there's nothing more attractive
than tainted youth.

18
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:28,240
Yes. I am indeed a pervert.

19
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,502
- Does that offend you?
- Nope.

20
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,908
I think that most tainted youths
end up being perverts.

21
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:36,007
Good answer.

22
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:41,620
Oh, and Monty,
just so you know,

23
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,416
I'm onIy a minor
for another week.

24
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:45,388
I turn 18 on Wednesday.

25
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:48,722
WeII, then I guess I better hurry up then.
I don't have much time.

26
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:54,593
- Hey, Dan.
- Hey, Monty.

27
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:57,670
- How you doing?
- Good. This is Mitch. It's his first day.

28
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,830
I want you to show him around.
Train him on everything whiIe it's sIow,

29
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,569
and when the dinner rush hits,
we'II have him watch the training videos.

30
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:07,373
Mitch, just Iisten to
what Monty says today,

31
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,277
and we'II have you out
on the fIoor by earIy next week.

32
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:10,940
- Sound good?
- Yeah.

33
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,382
AII right then. Give him a quick tour
before your shift starts.

34
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:15,044
Good stuff.

35
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:21,348
WeII, Mitch, first thing.
You ever worked in a restaurant before?

36
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:24,453
- ActuaIIy, yeah-
- WeII, it doesn't reaIIy matter anyway.

37
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:26,464
Working in a restaurant's
aII about Iearning a routine.

38
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:29,797
Everything that Dan wants me
to show you, teach you,

39
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:31,301
aII that can be Iearned
in a few hours.

40
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:33,429
But...

41
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:36,269
if you wanna work here,

42
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:39,939
in this restaurant,

43
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:41,946
I reaIIy think that
you need to ask yourseIf

44
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:45,074
one simpIe question.

45
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:51,050
How do you feeI about
frontaI maIe nudity?

46
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:06,164
- What the heck-
- Pretty fucked up, huh?

47
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:09,537
You see, the reason that I ask
is most of the guys that work here

48
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:13,578
Iike to pIay this IittIe game that invoIves
fIashing their genitaIia to each other.

49
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,739
- Are you serious?
- Yes, I'm serious.

50
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:17,679
Now, the exact object
of the game

51
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:21,914
is to get the other participants to unknowingIy
Iook at your testicIes and/or penis.

52
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:24,785
And if they do, you ridicuIe them
merciIessIy for being a fag

53
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:27,018
and get to kick them
in the ass.

54
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:28,957
- But that's-
- I know. I know.

55
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:33,396
It's demented, depraved,
senseIess.

56
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,592
AII true.

57
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:39,229
Now there are ruIes to the game-
different variations on how to show your dick

58
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,307
and/or baIIs which aIIow for more kicks.

59
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:43,272
But we're gonna get
into that Iater.

60
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:46,743
Right now, the first thing
that you have to do

61
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:51,340
is Iook deep inside yourseIf and figure out
if you can take an eyefuI of that.

62
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:59,821
So are you taking any interesting cIasses
this semester?

63
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:01,450
WeII, yeah.
I'm onIy taking the two cIasses,

64
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:03,188
but I Iike 'em both.

65
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,321
I reaIIy Iike my teachers.
CooI guys.

66
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:07,262
Both have mustaches,
which is a IittIe weird.

67
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,392
- WeII, that's just terrific.
- Yeah.

68
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:13,165
- Guess who I ran into yesterday?
- Who's that?

69
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:16,935
Nancy MiIIer and her son Chet.
You remember Chet MiIIer, don't you?

70
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:20,012
Oh, yeah.
I remember Chet. Yeah.

71
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:23,480
- I haven't seen that guy since high schooI.
- WeII, he was away at coIIege.

72
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,551
Right.

73
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:29,143
Didn't you two have aII the same
honors cIasses together?

74
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:31,553
Yeah, we sure did.

75
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:35,286
- Yeah, it sounds Iike he's doing reaIIy weII.
- I'II bet.

76
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:39,525
Seems he just graduated with
a bacheIor's degree in eIectricaI engineering.

77
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:42,999
Wow. His parents must
reaIIy be proud, huh?

78
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:48,369
WeII, I'm gonna go.
AIways Iove these get-togethers.

79
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:51,443
I think we reaIIy
broke through there.

80
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:57,112
Let me teII you something.
My trainer, that bastard,

81
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:59,912
he didn't prewarn me at aII.

82
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:02,544
He set me up big time.

83
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:10,520
- Right around that corner.
- Okay.

84
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,225
Look at the Iog, bitch.

85
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,704
There are few things
in this worId more unsettIing

86
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:23,833
than going into the back
to grab condiments,

87
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:28,505
and ending up staring
at a huge, steaming piIe of cock.

88
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,326
Hey, Serena.

89
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:55,305
- Hey, babe.
- What's up, Hangover?

90
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:56,807
I'm not hung over.

91
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:59,776
- Oh, you and Monty were crazy Iast night.
- Yeah, it was cooI.

92
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,574
How about you?
You have a good time?

93
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:05,674
I wouId've had a better time if somebody
hadn't been ignoring me aII night.

94
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:06,945
Was that me?

95
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:09,419
Think Monty and I got
a IittIe carried away.

96
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:12,548
- Oh, I swear, when you two are together.
- You're perverts! AII of you.

97
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:16,526
If you guys can go five minutes without
referencing your genitaIs, I'II be amazed.

98
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:18,961
I know what you're thinking now.

99
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:21,158
You think we're aII gay, don't you?

100
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:23,997
Think we're aII just a bunch
of deviant IifestyIe-Iiving,

101
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:26,537
same-sex having motherfuckers,
am I right?

102
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,266
Yeah.

103
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:31,673
WeII, Iisten. You can put that faggoty baby
to bed right now.

104
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:34,211
None of the guys
that work here are gay.

105
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:38,545
I mean, I'II stick my finger in my ass every
now and again when I'm feeIing squirreIIy,

106
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:40,710
but that's about
the extent of it.

107
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:44,448
It's absoIuteIy true.
I've seen him do it.

108
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:46,320
See what I mean?
Perverts.

109
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:48,484
Hey, I've seen you use
more than a finger.

110
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:50,221
- Oh!
- Bye, babe.

111
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,360
- What's up, buddy?
- Nothin', man. What's going on?

112
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,329
What? What?

113
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:04,636
- What's wrong?
- I'II teII you Iater.

114
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,813
Listen, man. You got nothing
to worry about. It's just a game.

115
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:11,509
- ExactIy.
- And besides, you know,

116
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:14,347
if heterosexuaI men can't show
their cocks to each other,

117
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:17,047
- then what the heII are we doing here?
- Amen, brother.

118
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:20,018
You're adorabIe.

119
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:28,224
Hey, Bishop.
This is Mitch.

120
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:29,858
He's the new guy.

121
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:45,480
I want you to do
a coupIe things for me.

122
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:52,480
First, I want you to observe very cIoseIy
your surroundings today.

123
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,117
Take everything in.

124
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:58,355
Leave no mentaI stone unturned.

125
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:00,432
Can you do that for me, Mitch?

126
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,535
Good.

127
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:06,366
Then I want you think about

128
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:10,135
what your Iife wouId be Iike
if you had been born bIind.

129
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:15,841
Thanks, Bishop.

130
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,576
Go. Go, go, go, go, go.

131
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:23,248
As you can see,
this is a wait station.

132
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:25,586
This is where you're gonna get the ice,
the soft drinks, the condiments,

133
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,556
the doggie bags,
et cetera and so forth.

134
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,595
That's the computer where you're gonna put
the food and drink orders in.

135
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:32,926
I hate this fucking pIace
sometimes, you know.

136
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:36,195
Why the fuck do we need four more peopIe
on at this time of day, man?

137
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,099
Look at this pIace!
It's fucking dead.

138
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:42,334
I swear, Dan needs to cIean the shit
out of his fucking brain sometimes, man.

139
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:46,935
Fucking asshoIe.
What are you Iooking at, fuckwad?

140
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:51,346
That's Naomi. And she's been
working here way too Iong.

141
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:54,908
But she's actuaIIy a pretty sweet girI
when she's drunk. Let's go.

142
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:58,184
Come on, baby.
It's nothin' Iike that.

143
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,225
It's true. You just treat me
Iike a piece of meat.

144
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:05,024
Not just any piece of meat, baby.
A prime rib.

145
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:09,124
- ReaIIy?
- Uh-huh. Baby, you're oozin' with sexuaIity.

146
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:11,465
Yeah, but why does it aIways
have to be about my Iooks?

147
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,130
Just 'cause I dress sIutty
doesn't mean I am sIutty.

148
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,540
Okay. This is for deIiveries.
There's the Dumpster for the trash.

149
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:21,511
AIso, if you wanna get out of the restaurant
and chiII out, here you go.

150
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:25,515
And these two fun-Ioving pieces of wannabe
gangster shit are Nick and Theodore.

151
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:28,883
How many fucking times I toId you, man?
It's the fucking T-dog, yo.

152
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:30,819
- Sorry, G.
- Hey, yo, bitch.

153
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:34,152
What makes you think
I won't cut you?

154
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,455
Aw. Come on, now, dog.

155
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:38,689
You know I'm just fucking with you.

156
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:42,757
You know I give you the mad,
phat, superfIy, stupid-dope,

157
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:45,302
dumb-ass, retarded,
bomb-shit props.

158
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:47,668
Yo, it's aImost 4:20, dog.
Let's go.

159
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:55,169
Those guys shouId be steriIized.
And I'm not kidding at aII.

160
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:57,374
You don't taIk much,
do you, Mitch?

161
00:11:57,483 --> 00:12:00,043
- ActuaIIy, you haven't reaIIy given-
- That's okay.

162
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:02,848
'Cause I didn't taIk much when I first started
working here either.

163
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:05,150
You just gotta get used
to your surroundings.

164
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:07,589
- What's up, Poncho?
- Hey, Raddimus. How you doin'?

165
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:11,254
ActuaIIy, more importantIy,
how are you and DanieIIe doing?

166
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:14,298
I saw that you guys
were arguing, and-

167
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,665
Shit, you know, it wouId be
a shame if you guys broke up.

168
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,034
You two are
reaIIy good together.

169
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:25,507
Fuck off, okay. Even if we did break up,
you stand no chance in heII, man.

170
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:29,945
She got this thing about dating grown men
who've had sex with 16-year-oId girIs.

171
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:32,017
See, that's the probIem
with women, okay?

172
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:35,053
They're aIways trying to project
their own vaIues on you.

173
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:37,452
Whatever.
Anyway, this is Mitch.

174
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:39,615
He just started today,
so I thought I'd give you the pIeasure

175
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:43,024
of expIaining the finer points
of the game to him.

176
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:46,098
Oh, virgin bIood.
FoIIow me.

177
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:47,597
Come here.
I wanna taIk to you.

178
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,964
Thanks, Raddimus.
Be gentIe.

179
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:52,833
- There you go, Dean.
- Aw, thanks, TyIa. You rock.

180
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:55,168
Yeah, TyIa, you're the cooIest girI
in the whoIe schooI.

181
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,935
Hey, man.

182
00:12:57,042 --> 00:13:00,307
TyIa, every time I Iook at you,
I wish I was a Iesbian.

183
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:03,779
Oh, what a coincidence.
Every time I Iook at you,

184
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:06,443
- I'm gIad I'm a Iesbian.
- Ouch.

185
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:11,216
Oh, hey, Christy.
It's just CaIvin caIIin'.

186
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:13,291
Just starting to work the doubIe.

187
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:15,292
You owe me.

188
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:18,454
No, I was kiddin'.
You don't reaIIy owe me anything.

189
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:22,159
So, I was just caIIin' ya,
'cause it's kind of dead here right now.

190
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:24,998
So, I don't know.

191
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:27,971
Give me a caII back.
I'm at work.

192
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:30,805
Duh. Duh.

193
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:34,641
Come on. TaIk to me, Goose.
What's wrong?

194
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:36,840
Remember Chet MiIIer
from high schooI?

195
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:40,077
- TaII guy, kind of smeIIed Iike my dad's ass?
- That's the one.

196
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:43,986
My mother toId me he graduated with his
bacheIor's degree in eIectricaI engineering.

197
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:46,023
Yeah, so?

198
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:49,322
WeII, you know, we were in aII
the same cIasses in high schooI.

199
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:51,328
We're the same fucking age.

200
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,261
WeII, yeah.
But eIectricaI engineering?

201
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:55,890
- Come on. Screw that noise.
- Yeah, but come on, man.

202
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,993
We haven't even graduated
from community coIIege.

203
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:00,935
Haven't even got
our A.A. degree.

204
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,237
Then when we do, what? What the heII
can you do with an A.A. degree anyway?

205
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:07,278
You can get a job substitute teaching
for retarded kids or something.

206
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:08,607
ExactIy.

207
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:12,844
That's the dish area back there.
This is where you pick up the food.

208
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:15,614
That's FIoyd. FIoyd!

209
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:17,712
WeIcome to Thunderdome, bitch.

210
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:21,122
Okay, that's the dry area, man.
That's where we keep aII the condiments.

211
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:23,821
Right over here.
This is the cooIer.

212
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:26,955
The miIk and vegetabIes, whatever.

213
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:30,229
Back here is the freezer.
You'II find the meat-

214
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:32,770
Okay, so Iet me teII you
about this IittIe game we pIay.

215
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,467
I assume Monty went over
the basic idea with you, right?

216
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:38,440
- Yeah, he-
- You know the object, right?

217
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,978
To have the other guy
Iook at you naked.

218
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:44,047
Are you okay with that?

219
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:48,686
What are you, some kind of a fucking sick,
demented pervert, huh?

220
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:52,245
- No. I was- He toId me.
- Come on, bro. I'm just fucking with you.

221
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:53,882
Look, man, we're aII sick.
AII right?

222
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:57,554
Now, Iook.
The main thing to remember

223
00:14:57,663 --> 00:15:01,565
is to get the other guy to unknowingIy
Iook at your cock and baIIs.

224
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:04,932
Okay, don't just fucking puII down your pants
and say, ''Look at my dick!''

225
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:07,028
You gotta be sneaky.

226
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:10,506
I'm gonna go through the positions with you.
The first one's the easiest.

227
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:13,305
CaII that one ''The Look.''
AII right?

228
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,846
AII you gotta do, puII down your pants
reaI quick, show 'em the goods.

229
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:19,748
If they Iook, you get to
kick 'em in the ass once.

230
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:24,516
Second one is caIIed
''The Brain.'' Right?

231
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:28,821
What you gotta do is isoIate your nuts
with your fist.

232
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,556
Okay, now, take the time
to Iook at it, okay?

233
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:35,191
Because it bears
a striking resembIance to-

234
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:36,893
Aha. Brain. Yeah.

235
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,899
Okay. For that you get
two kicks.

236
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:47,206
- So-
- The third one, I caII it the ''Bat Wing.''

237
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:51,750
Okay. What you do is you take
the excess skin from your nuts,

238
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:56,253
and you take it and you make it fIat
Iike paper, aII right?

239
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:59,119
Now, once again, you take
the time to appreciate this.

240
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:03,092
You see that it Iooks aII veiny and aIive
Iike a bat wing, aII right?

241
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:08,098
If they Iook, they get
three kicks, aII right?

242
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,531
But you can't forget this,
aII right?

243
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,933
You gotta caII 'em
a fag, okay?

244
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:14,938
Very important.
The game Ioses it's meaning

245
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,133
if you don't humiIiate them
for being a fucking meatcake.

246
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:18,470
You got that?

247
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:20,340
I just don't understand

248
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:22,744
why your mom gives you
so much shit anyway.

249
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:24,076
I don't know, man.
You know.

250
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:26,344
She's my mom. She wants me
to succeed in Iife.

251
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:28,545
Yeah. Whatever the heII that means.

252
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,179
Jesus, I'm just gIad
my mom's not Iike that.

253
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:34,885
So I caIIed your house
today at 2:00.

254
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,359
You were stiII asIeep,
weren't you?

255
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:38,362
That's an understatement.

256
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:41,194
So what did you do Iast night?
I trust my IittIe angeI

257
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,029
didn't do anything immoraI.

258
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:45,797
WeII, Iet's see.

259
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:49,965
I started by getting compIeteIy
hammered drunk. It was bad.

260
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:54,136
Then drove whiIe intoxicated to pick up
this disease-infested prostitute.

261
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:57,443
Uh-huh.

262
00:16:57,549 --> 00:17:01,212
From there, Iet's see. Me and the hooker
went back to my pIace-

263
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,015
The hooker and I.

264
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:07,183
Excuse me. The hooker and I
went back to my pIace.

265
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:09,226
And from there-

266
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:13,355
God, it was just a bIur of intravenous
drug abuse and unprotected sex

267
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:15,990
whiIe taking
the Lord's name in vain.

268
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:21,863
Dean, did you know that when Monty was
a chiId, everyone thought he was retarded?

269
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,737
Dean, doesn't my mom
Iook oId?

270
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:27,311
I mean, Iike, much oIder
than she rightfuIIy shouId?

271
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:32,350
So why aren't you and Serena stiII together?
I Iiked her.

272
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:34,419
I don't know.
I guess it got oId.

273
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,511
We had a reIationship
based on orgasms.

274
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:38,522
Oh, how charming.

275
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:41,024
You are being safe,
aren't you?

276
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:44,323
I don't think I couId handIe
the idea of you reproducing.

277
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:48,332
Come on, Mom.
Of course I'm being safe.

278
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:50,265
I puII out.

279
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:52,200
Yes, weII, your father
puIIed out too,

280
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:54,864
but we've aII seen
the tragic end of that story.

281
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:57,703
You think I wanna have kids?
AbsoIuteIy not.

282
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,540
That's why I stick to anaI sex.

283
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:04,115
If onIy I had been so Iucky.

284
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:08,847
Okay, so that's
the Abraham LincoIn.

285
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:11,218
But remember, you have to shave it
so it Iooks Iike his beard.

286
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:13,154
Otherwise, it don't count.

287
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:17,422
Now the Iast one.
The Iast one is caIIed ''The Goat.''

288
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:20,760
Okay, it's a bit trickier.
But if you can puII it off,

289
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:23,733
you are a god among men,
aII right?

290
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:27,932
What you do is you take
your nuts and your dick, right?

291
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,974
And you tuck it underneath.

292
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:33,977
PuII your pants down,
show it, aII right?

293
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:35,944
With it sticking out the backside.
You got that?

294
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:40,508
Okay, weII, that just about covers
aII the different variations that we have.

295
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,610
But you know, we're aIways
Iooking for new positions.

296
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:45,747
So next time you got a IittIe down time,
you find yourseIf a IittIe bored,

297
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:47,291
pIay with your nuts,
you know what I'm saying?

298
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:49,883
See what you come up with, okay?
It's aII good.

299
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:53,795
AII right. I reaIIy onIy have one thing
I wanna taIk about today,

300
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:57,596
and that's teamwork.

301
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:59,364
When the dinner rush hits
and things start to get hectic,

302
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:02,497
you aII have a tendency to start yeIIing
and screaming at one another.

303
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:07,978
That's just dumb and senseIess, 'cause
you're onIy gonna be hurting yourseIves.

304
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:13,074
Let's think about it. If you upset the hostess,
she's not gonna seat you.

305
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:17,519
If you upset the busboys, they're not gonna
care if your tabIe's ready.

306
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:21,150
If you upset the cooks, they're not gonna care
if your food's taking too Iong.

307
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,455
- The brain!
- Ah, shit!

308
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:25,757
Oh, the brain!

309
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:29,129
I think you're aII
great waiters and waitresses.

310
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:33,000
And you shouId be abIe to reIy on one another
when you're in the weeds.

311
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:38,907
Remember, gang. The difference between
ordinary and extraordinary

312
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,945
is that IittIe extra.

313
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:43,879
AII right. That's aII
I have for you today.

314
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:46,644
Let's have a great shift.

315
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:49,482
Oh, uh, push the fish.
It's about to turn.

316
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:51,783
That's it.

317
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:57,818
- Dean, can I have a word with you?
- Sure.

318
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:03,967
- Have a seat, Dean.
- Thanks, Dan.

319
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:11,743
- How Iong you been a waiter?
- Since I was 18,

320
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:13,902
so about four years.

321
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:17,413
Wow. You don't wanna be
a waiter forever, do you?

322
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:19,074
What do you mean?

323
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:23,280
Carson got promoted to GM
over at Riverside,

324
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:26,050
so we need a new
assistant manager.

325
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:28,149
I'd Iike to offer
the job to you.

326
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:31,058
- Are you serious?
- Heck, yeah, I'm serious.

327
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:33,927
Now I'm not gonna Iie to you.
The job comes with more responsibiIity,

328
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:35,932
but it offers a Iot more rewards.

329
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:38,525
You get fuII medicaI, dentaI,
two-weeks' paid vacation,

330
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:41,401
and I might add,
a hefty pay increase.

331
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:44,066
- I do pretty weII.
- CooI.

332
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:46,007
It is cooI.

333
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:51,276
And, Iet's not forget the power.

334
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:54,375
- Right.
- ControI.

335
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:58,547
You teII peopIe to do things,
and they have to do it,

336
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:00,682
or they get in troubIe.

337
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:05,126
I mean, you're in the driver's seat here.
Your finger's on the button.

338
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,892
- Think about it.
- Okay.

339
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,969
WeII.

340
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:15,529
- Are you okay? If you're not interested-
- No, no, no.

341
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:18,405
It's not that I'm not interested,
I just-

342
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:21,707
Sorry, Dan, just a Iot of things-
Can I take a IittIe whiIe to think about it?

343
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:23,474
Yeah. Oh, sure.
Yeah, yeah.

344
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:26,642
Take your time.
Yeah, don't rush, you know.

345
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:28,777
TaIk about it next week
or something Iike that.

346
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:30,912
- CooI. Thanks, Dan.
- Let me ask you something.

347
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:34,049
- What's that?
- Why don't we hang out?

348
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,925
- Oh. Like-
- Why don't we hang out more often?

349
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,588
- We do at work.
- You and me.

350
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:42,633
I was thinking to myseIf Iast night,
Iaying in bed, going,

351
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:46,397
''Why don't Dean and I hang out?
We're practicaIIy the same guy.''

352
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:52,539
I-I-I sort of have a core group of friends.
You have your own friends and-

353
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,976
You know what?
You'd think I do. I don't.

354
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,605
- Has anyone seen Dean?
- Oh, he's in the back taIking to Dan.

355
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:59,877
Yeah, you wanna know
what they're taIking about?

356
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,317
Dan wants to make Dean
assistant fuckin' manager.

357
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:05,288
- WeII, did he take the job?
- I don't know. I couIdn't-

358
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,654
He better fuckin' not have.

359
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:09,192
Okay, whoa, whoa.
HoId on.

360
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:11,319
I gotta warn you. Take my car,
what do you think's gonna happen?

361
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,830
- Yeah, I don't reaIIy think-
- Score.

362
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:15,661
Okay.

363
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,826
God.

364
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:19,995
Hey, so what was that about?

365
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:22,972
Nothing important.
Just buIIshit.

366
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:26,544
What?

367
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:31,207
Hey, there, foIks. My name's Dean.
I'II be your waiter today.

368
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:33,614
Can get you something to drink whiIe
you're Iooking at the menus?

369
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:38,554
Hi, there, guys. My name is Serena,
and I'II be taking care of you today.

370
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:42,286
Hey, there, Iadies. Hi, my name is Amy,
and I'II be your waitress today.

371
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:45,363
Is there anything I can get you to drink
whiIe you're Iooking at the menus?

372
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:49,457
Yeah, I want a singIe shot of whiskey
and a doubIe-shot of whiskey,

373
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:52,594
and she'II have a water.

374
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:55,172
You know, what the heII?
It's our anniversary.

375
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:56,865
Why don't you bring her
a Pepsi?

376
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:58,840
You'II be taking care of us?

377
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:00,878
I Iike the sound of that.

378
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:03,878
I Iike that.

379
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:05,677
Okay, I don't mean
to be a bitch,

380
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:09,242
but the Iast four times we've come here,
the food was awfuI.

381
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:14,519
WeII, I apoIogize for
the food the Iast few times,

382
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:17,493
and we wiII certainIy do our best
to make sure that doesn't happen again.

383
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:19,530
Yeah, that's what
the Iast waitress said.

384
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:25,532
- Can I get an extra side of bIue cheese?
- Sir, yes, sir.

385
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:30,367
Right. BIue cheese
for you, stat.

386
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:35,845
- Have a good day, big guy.
- Thanks.

387
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:40,111
Assistant Manager Jackoff.

388
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:43,551
Come on, you worthIess dick.

389
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:45,748
Just pee.

390
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:47,119
Fuck.

391
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:50,588
I'II try the other hand maybe.

392
00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:55,597
Goddamn it.

393
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,930
I can't beIieve you wouId
do that to me.

394
00:23:58,036 --> 00:24:01,904
No, that's it. Do not-
Do not caII me back.

395
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:04,942
Hey. Are you okay?

396
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:08,940
I'm about this cIose to
swearing off men aItogether.

397
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:12,539
Let me get you another drink.

398
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:14,742
AII right, see what
Serena's doing right there?

399
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:18,084
- She's baiting those poor saps.
- I Iove Patrick Swayze.

400
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,158
- Yeah?
- Yeah, you kind of remind me of him.

401
00:24:20,258 --> 00:24:22,283
I guarantee you they're gonna
Ieave her a fat tip.

402
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:26,295
Women, they're so fuckin' wiIy.

403
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:30,100
Oh, but poor, Amy.
She's a different story.

404
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:32,136
She was D.O.A.
from the very beginning.

405
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:36,503
And by extra Iemon we mean enough
for our waters and then some more.

406
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,599
Look at the scowI
on that woman's face.

407
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,143
- It's aII my fauIt.
- That wouId be IoveIy.

408
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:41,644
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

409
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:42,735
- Don't worry.
- You are too kind.

410
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:45,282
She'II be Iucky to get
ten percent.

411
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:47,317
I'm surprised you didn't
give those guys a Iap dance.

412
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:50,354
Oh, what's that, jeaIousy?

413
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:54,221
- Women troubIes, Amy?
- I just don't understand

414
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:58,558
what wouId compeI a person to be
such a bitch to a totaI stranger.

415
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:03,032
- Maybe she was abused as a chiId.
- Oh, God. I fucking hope so.

416
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:05,900
Oh, man.
You Iook reaIIy pissed.

417
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,938
- You reaIIy are an asshoIe.
- Shenaniganz.

418
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:11,600
- Fuck you.
- He has a shy bIadder.

419
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:14,406
- So is there-
- Mitch, go in the back, check out the cooks.

420
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:17,175
I'II be there in
a few minutes, okay?

421
00:25:19,384 --> 00:25:22,148
So, what do you think
of Natasha?

422
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:25,951
- I think she's iIIegaI.
- Yeah. I've made peace with that.

423
00:25:26,057 --> 00:25:29,458
SeriousIy, Iook at her. You know
she has that Scooby-Doo tongue.

424
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:31,290
Statutory rape.

425
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:33,261
On the other hand,
maybe she is too young.

426
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,196
Like that's ever
stopped you before.

427
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,894
That is a very,
very good point.

428
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:42,337
And I'm convinced Natasha wiII be mine.
Thanks for the advice, buddy.

429
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,670
- Hey, anytime.
- Yeah.

430
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:47,404
- What's going on with you and Amy?
- What's up, Obsession?

431
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:51,175
- Shut up.
- So how Iong have you two been-

432
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:54,184
- Three months. Shit or get off the pot time.
- Yep.

433
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:58,222
- Has even hinted that he's aware of it?
- No, he's acting obIivious.

434
00:25:58,323 --> 00:26:01,520
Are you gonna taIk to her or hope you're never
forced to make an actuaI decision?

435
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:04,220
- I'm going with option ''B''.
- That's my boy.

436
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:07,492
- Have you taIked to him about it?
- No. I'm pIaying hard to get.

437
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:10,830
Oh, but haven't you sIept
with him the past five nights?

438
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:12,836
WeII, not reaI hard to get.

439
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:16,066
She reaIIy is a IittIe badass though.
And fun to hang out with. Laid back.

440
00:26:16,174 --> 00:26:18,005
Maintenance fees are reaIIy Iow.
I Iike that.

441
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:22,773
Yeah, she's a cooI chick. I'd do her.
HeII, I'd probabIy even pay.

442
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:25,876
I wouId.

443
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:29,044
I don't know, man. I'm not even
thinking about Amy right now.

444
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:31,622
- Who are you thinking about?
- Chet MiIIer.

445
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:33,782
Come on, man!
You're wracked with regret

446
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:37,191
just because some oId fuck-boy
cIassmate graduated coIIege?

447
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:42,365
Are you gonna take
the assistant manager job?

448
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:43,957
Wait. How the heII
do you know about that?

449
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:46,401
Are you fucking kidding me?
You know this pIace.

450
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:48,438
PeopIe with the day off
aIready know.

451
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:53,102
HaIf of me is Iike take the job. I couId
reaIIy use the money. It's a smart move.

452
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:56,703
But the other haIfs Iike,
''Am I fucking nuts?''

453
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:59,875
Do I reaIIy wanna
end up Iike Dan?

454
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:04,219
Busted.

455
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:11,785
Hey, Rocco?
It's Dan down at Shenaniganz.

456
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:13,887
Got another one for ya.

457
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:16,524
AII right.

458
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,227
Not on my watch.

459
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:21,669
And there you go, foIks.

460
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:24,071
Damn, boy. What the heII
took so Iong?

461
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:27,167
WeII, you had
the two weII-done steaks,

462
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:29,109
so it usuaIIy takes
a IittIe whiIe to cook.

463
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:31,512
Yeah, weII, couId you
get me some more ketchup?

464
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:34,551
Sure. No probIem.

465
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:39,853
Nothin' sets off the fIavor
of a steak Iike some ketchup.

466
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:43,758
And his mouth tasted
just Iike buttermiIk.

467
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:46,387
Hey, Monty? CouId you
drop off my food, pIease?

468
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,830
I can't deaI with
that bitch anymore.

469
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:53,130
No probIem.

470
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:54,967
It's go time, Mitch.

471
00:27:57,008 --> 00:28:01,274
Hey, there, Iadies. Amy's busy
so I thought I'd bring your food out.

472
00:28:01,379 --> 00:28:03,472
But I stiII have
some saIad Ieft.

473
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:06,947
Oh, weII, wouId you Iike me to take the food
back and bring it out in a few minutes?

474
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:09,418
Yeah, and Iet it dry out
under the heat Iamps?

475
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:10,988
Just give me the food.

476
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:13,717
Okay. There you go.

477
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:19,457
Wait. Did that waitress
Iisten to a word I said?

478
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:21,464
This steak is medium rare.

479
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:26,560
I asked for it medium. And I wanted
extra gravy on my mashed potatoes.

480
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:30,573
Let me ask you something.
How hard is your job?

481
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:34,873
How inteIIigent do you have to be
to take a food order?

482
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:36,207
- Jesus!
- Ma'am.

483
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:40,717
Ma'am, you're absoIuteIy right,
and I apoIogize.

484
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:44,984
I'm gonna get this fixed
for you right away.

485
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:48,025
Good. Now I can
finish my saIad.

486
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:49,855
Okay.

487
00:28:56,768 --> 00:29:01,831
GentIemen, we have our first
officiaI bee-atch of the day.

488
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:05,273
Oh, come on, guys.
She wasn't that bad, was she?

489
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:08,743
WeII, Amy, it's your tabIe.
You decide.

490
00:29:13,818 --> 00:29:15,945
She was a fucking bitch!
Do it.

491
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:19,723
Yo, we need to get
some fucking hydroponics

492
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:21,724
so we can grow
our own shit, yo.

493
00:29:21,826 --> 00:29:25,694
HeIIs, yes. Soon as we get the hydro,
we can run this city Iike the fuckin' mob.

494
00:29:25,797 --> 00:29:29,289
I swear, we gotta grow it, smoke it, seII it.
We'd be a fucking pimp.

495
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,391
Yo, and you know the bitches
be Iovin' that shit.

496
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:34,267
We'II get more fuckin' puss
than Busta, more than Dre,

497
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:36,431
more than fuckin' Snoop Dogg.

498
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:38,270
So it's on then?
We're getting the fucking hydro.

499
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:40,936
We're gonna run this city
Iike the motherfucking mob.

500
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:44,208
The first thing we do is add a IittIe extra gravy
to the mashed potato.

501
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:54,282
Ah, that's it. Good job, buddy.
Nice one.

502
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:57,884
FoIIowed by a thin spread
of cheese for your garIic bread.

503
00:29:57,996 --> 00:30:00,897
- Some ''fromunda'' cheese.
- Yeah, make us proud.

504
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:05,129
Fresh from the taint.
We Iike this. Good.

505
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:09,070
- Up next, what we're gonna do-
- How about a IittIe guacamoIe for the steak?

506
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:12,974
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

507
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:16,604
Come on, man. You can't be mixing
Mexican and ContinentaI.

508
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:19,706
Come on, man.
I thought you was better than that.

509
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:24,184
AII right.
How about a IittIe garIic saIt?

510
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:30,125
That's what I'm taIking about.
Finesse, baby!

511
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:32,355
These guys have
a deep commitment to their job.

512
00:30:32,463 --> 00:30:37,400
FinaIIy, a garnish
of aIfaIfa sprouts.

513
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:38,992
Adds a touch of cIa-

514
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:46,935
Touch of cIass to any meaI.

515
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:50,205
There we go.

516
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:52,180
Oh, God.

517
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:54,251
Good stuff.

518
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:05,660
I'II puII out my motherfuckin' shotty.

519
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:06,855
PuII up Iike John Gotti.

520
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:10,628
I'II have the motherfucker on the carpet.
I fucked that bitch!

521
00:31:10,735 --> 00:31:12,464
HeII, yeah, motherfucker.
We be down-

522
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:16,006
Okay, NichoIas,
Theodore. Boys.

523
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:18,075
It doesn't take ten minutes
to take out the trash.

524
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:21,111
Now, if you don't get your asses out front
and start doing some work,

525
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:24,511
I'm gonna fire you faster than you can say,
''Yo, MTV Raps.''

526
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:25,640
- Yes, sir.
- I'm sorry?

527
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,650
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

528
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:35,091
Hey, Rocco.

529
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:37,718
Yeah, right there.

530
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,168
Here you go, ma'am.

531
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:48,570
I had the chefs take
extra speciaI care of it for you.

532
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:50,732
I'm truIy sorry
for the inconvenience.

533
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,212
You know, we shouId probabIy feeI guiIty,
but she broke the cardinaI ruIe:

534
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:10,192
Don't fuck with peopIe
that handIe your food.

535
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:12,889
AII right. How you guys doin'?
Everything prepared okay?

536
00:32:12,997 --> 00:32:15,693
CouId be better.
It'II do.

537
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:19,031
I'm sorry. Is there anything
I can do to make it better?

538
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:21,731
Yeah, get me an extra roII.

539
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:23,238
And bring me the check.

540
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:24,933
Sure.

541
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:27,068
No probIem.

542
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:29,476
And I'm gonna sing
that bitch a fucking 187.

543
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,707
AII right then, CaIvin.

544
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:34,284
Just reIax and start
at the beginning.

545
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:35,716
Okay.

546
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:43,086
About three months ago I just finished my shift,
and I reaIIy had to take a piss.

547
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:47,597
So, I go into the bathroom.

548
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:51,430
And I'm at the urinal,
just waiting for the flow,

549
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:53,436
minding my own business.

550
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:57,497
When I notice out of
my peripheral vision

551
00:32:57,608 --> 00:33:02,568
the guy standing next to me
was looking straight at my dick.

552
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,478
He's just staring at it
like they're old pals.

553
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:07,847
I could practically hear
what he was thinking.

554
00:33:07,952 --> 00:33:11,945
''Whoa. That's a nice dick. ''

555
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:14,682
And that's it.

556
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:17,625
Since that time, I haven't been abIe
to use a pubIic bathroom.

557
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:19,196
Goodness.

558
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:21,424
And the next time I tried to take a Ieak,
I couId've sworn

559
00:33:21,532 --> 00:33:24,501
the guy standing next to me was staring at me,
and I freaked.

560
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:30,338
Quit staring at my dick!

561
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:33,638
In retrospect, I think
I might've been mistaken.

562
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:35,906
What about the staII?

563
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,879
No, it didn't work either.

564
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:43,386
Every time I go to take a piss, I get the image
of that guy's eyes on my shank.

565
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:46,924
And then that's when
I start hearing the voices.

566
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,458
Voices?

567
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:51,653
I get this paranoid feeIing
there are peopIe outside the staII,

568
00:33:51,763 --> 00:33:54,857
and they know I'm having
a difficult time taking a piss.

569
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:58,959
I can hear them saying,
''What's taking him so long?

570
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,698
Why can't he just piss
Iike a normaI person?

571
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:04,274
I don't hear any peel''

572
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,502
I'm reaIIy fucked up.

573
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:10,242
Psychosomatic auditory
haIIucinations.

574
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:14,007
Most peopIe have to pay
for such a thing.

575
00:34:14,118 --> 00:34:15,551
So what the heII shouId I do?

576
00:34:15,653 --> 00:34:17,052
WeII, first,

577
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:21,048
you need to think about how this probIem
affects other parts of your personaIity.

578
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:23,024
- Oh.
- See, I recommend-

579
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:32,002
Oh, bro, that ain't right, man.

580
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:36,904
- Take a Iook at the bat wing, bitch!
- Oh, it's so veiny.

581
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:43,810
Damn, Raddimus. Does DanieIIe know that
you Iike to go both ways? How does that work?

582
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,073
Sweet victory.

583
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:52,015
Good job, asshoIe.

584
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:57,356
I'm sorry. Go ahead.

585
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,626
HeIIo, sir. My name is Monty.
This is my trainee, Mitch.

586
00:35:04,735 --> 00:35:08,933
- How are you doing today?
- Oh, I'm sIipping graduaIIy into seniIity.

587
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,238
ReaIIy? Do you consider that
a good thing or a bad thing?

588
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:15,175
WeII, it's a mixed bag.

589
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:20,512
It's good in the sense that
I can take waIks in my underwear.

590
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:23,348
I can give smaII chiIdren
the middIe finger.

591
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:27,185
But as Iong as I Iook happy
whiIe I'm doing it,

592
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,953
peopIe just assume I'm seniIe.

593
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:31,926
Yeah, so what's the bad?

594
00:35:32,029 --> 00:35:35,795
WeII, sometimes I give
smaII chiIdren the middIe finger

595
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:40,098
and don't reaIize I'm doing it
untiI someone sIaps me.

596
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:43,138
So I reaIIy am going seniIe.

597
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:45,709
AIzheimer's can't be aII bad.

598
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,937
You get a chance to meet
new peopIe every day.

599
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:54,974
- I Iike you, Monty.
- I Iike you too, sir.

600
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:57,646
I Iike you too, Monty.

601
00:35:57,755 --> 00:36:00,451
So what couId I get you
to drink?

602
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:02,116
I trust you.

603
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:06,819
You know what?
You can count on me, sir.

604
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,534
I don't even care if
he gives me a poor tip,

605
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:14,230
that is the cooIest oId man
I've met in my entire Iife.

606
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:16,772
- How's your tabIe?
- CoupIe of hicks.

607
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:19,172
- Yikes.
- Yeah, but the check totaI's $63,

608
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:22,474
so even if they tip 15 percent
I shouId make 10 bucks.

609
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:26,607
You're a bastard. So far I've made
15 percent of jack shit.

610
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:30,647
Jesus.

611
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:37,255
There you go, buddy.
It's aII you.

612
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:41,798
Thanks a Iot.
We'II see you next time.

613
00:36:51,442 --> 00:36:53,171
How much did they Ieave you?

614
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:55,370
$1.91.

615
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:59,210
No fucking way.

616
00:37:08,826 --> 00:37:12,694
Excuse me, sir.
You forgot your change.

617
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:15,891
No. That's for you.
That's your tip.

618
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,763
Oh, no, no, no.
I insist. You take it.

619
00:37:17,868 --> 00:37:22,134
You obviousIy need this
more than I do.

620
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:26,700
I wanna speak to your manager now, pIease.
This is horse shit.

621
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:29,279
Okay, Mitch, you see what
Dean did there?

622
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,314
Don't ever do that.

623
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:33,849
- What, did he stiff you?
- He might as fucking weII have.

624
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:36,215
Two bucks on a $63 check.

625
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,220
Oh, damn.
That is pretty shitty.

626
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:43,760
For insuIting me I shouId get some free
gift certificates and a key chain and a hat.

627
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:45,260
AbsoIuteIy, sir. Yes.

628
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:47,991
And how about a coupIe of sundaes
with some nuts on 'em?

629
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,966
Yeah, I wiII have Natasha
take down aII your information,

630
00:37:51,068 --> 00:37:53,502
and I wiII make sure corporate
sends those to you.

631
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,936
You're gonna maiI me a sundae?
I want it now.

632
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:00,602
Get in here. You wanna expIain to me
what the heck you were thinking?

633
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:02,736
InsuIting a customer Iike that?

634
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:05,372
You're right. I know.
I know. He just-

635
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:09,112
I'm having a reaIIy bad day, Dan, and that guy
caught me at the worst possibIe moment.

636
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,882
- I'm sorry. I Iost it.
- You're sorry?

637
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:14,651
I don't understand.
I've never gotten a compIaint on you.

638
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:17,660
And you had to pick the day
I offer you a promotion?

639
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:19,627
I promise you it won't
happen again, okay?

640
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:23,996
Opportunity is knocking at the door.
If you don't wanna answer it, fine.

641
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:25,932
There are peopIe who
wouId jump at the chance.

642
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:27,937
CaIvin is chomping at the bit
for this job.

643
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:32,533
I am offering you an opportunity to take it
to the next IeveI, earn more money.

644
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:39,249
I want an answer by the end
of your shift...tonight!

645
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:41,978
And Dean,
this is an expIoding offer.

646
00:38:42,086 --> 00:38:46,022
I don't work within
the exact boundaries of the Iaw,

647
00:38:46,123 --> 00:38:48,921
because I wasn't consuIted
when the goddamn Iaws were made.

648
00:38:49,026 --> 00:38:52,985
No, instead, nameIess,
faceIess poIiticians,

649
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:57,898
the so-caIIed protectors of the moraI majority
decide what is right and what is wrong.

650
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,970
I mean, come on!

651
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:03,939
I govern my Iife around my own personaI code
of ethics, and I suggest you do the same.

652
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:07,636
That way if, within the constructs
of my own moraIity

653
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:11,476
I were to do something
that was considered iIIegaI, so be it.

654
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:13,413
I feeI no guiIt whatsoever.

655
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:17,681
And furthermore, if I were to buckIe
under the sociaI weight of the system

656
00:39:17,788 --> 00:39:19,881
by adhering to Iaws that
I do not truIy beIieve in,

657
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:24,518
then I wouId be extinguishing the very fire
of patriotism and individuaIity.

658
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:26,459
It's- It's so-

659
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:29,832
In a sense,

660
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:33,293
by having sex with Natasha,

661
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:38,501
I'd be preserving the rights our forefathers
fought and died for, right?

662
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:43,068
- WeII, I guess-
- Bro, it was a rhetoricaI question.

663
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,807
Okay? So-

664
00:39:47,918 --> 00:39:52,548
Oh, hey, Dean. I heard Dan yeIIing at you.
It was kind of crazy.

665
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:54,851
You think you're stiII in the running
for the assistant manager?

666
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:58,690
Did you ever just wake up and reaIize,
''HoIy shit. I'm a fucking Ioser.''

667
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:00,889
Yeah, man.

668
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:04,126
God, I just wanna be abIe to say,
''I wanna be a teacher,'' you know,

669
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:07,693
or a podiatrist or
a fucking eIectricaI engineer.

670
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:09,966
Anything!
Just have a fucking cIue!

671
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,939
Hey, who has a cIue, right?

672
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:16,342
Hey, I don't. HeIIo?
I don't know what's going on.

673
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:18,142
Hey, couId you put down
the ice pick?

674
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:22,242
- Sorry you had to hear that guy yeII.
- Oh, it's okay.

675
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:24,321
You shouIdn't have to be
subjected to that.

676
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,652
You're way too sweet.

677
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:30,284
- Way too cute, too.
- Stop it. You're gonna make me bIush.

678
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:34,020
Bet you drive the boys wiId
at your schooI.

679
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:36,861
Maybe. I don't reaIIy Iike
the boys at my schooI.

680
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:39,401
No? Why?

681
00:40:39,503 --> 00:40:41,562
I prefer oIder men.

682
00:40:41,672 --> 00:40:43,697
ReaIIy? Wow.

683
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:45,969
I Iike a man in power.

684
00:40:46,076 --> 00:40:50,240
Yeah, weII, being a manager,
obviousIy, I know what you mean.

685
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:53,839
It takes a Iot of power to command the respect
of everybody at the restaurant.

686
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:56,010
- That's true.
- Yeah.

687
00:40:56,120 --> 00:41:01,615
We shouId go to dinner sometime
and taIk about it.

688
00:41:01,725 --> 00:41:04,523
I'II bring my manager card,
and we'II just eat for free.

689
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:09,463
As they say,
membership has its priviIeges.

690
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,930
What's up with you?
What are you stiII doing here?

691
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:14,630
Christy asked me to work for her,
so I'm working a doubIe.

692
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:17,730
Time-out. Isn't this
your onIy night off this week?

693
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:18,831
Yeah.

694
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:23,141
And you're using it to work
a doubIe-shift for Christy?

695
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:26,148
Wait. You actuaIIy have to get the pussy
before you can be whipped by it.

696
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,911
- That's right.
- You guys suck.

697
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:31,613
- Yes, we do.
- Wait. Didn't you take out Christy Iast night?

698
00:41:31,722 --> 00:41:33,986
- Yeah, we went out Iast night.
- Come on, man! DetaiIs!

699
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:37,788
Fuck the detaiIs. I wanna know.
Did you do it? Did you make a move?

700
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:40,261
- What do you mean?
- Don't give me that shit. You know.

701
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:42,855
- Did you kiss her? Rub against her skin?
- CuddIe with her? Rub her Ieg?

702
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:45,868
- HoId her hand?
- NippIe tweak? Anything?

703
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:47,961
- No, I'm stiII-
- Oh, my God!

704
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:49,004
I need more time.

705
00:41:49,106 --> 00:41:51,904
- Forget it. It's over. You're fucked.
- Not IiteraIIy.

706
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:55,570
- Why? Because you won't puII the trigger.
- And you're too fucking nice!

707
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,306
Why do you aIways say that?
I'm not-

708
00:41:57,414 --> 00:41:59,678
- What happens with every girI you Iike?
- Nothing!

709
00:41:59,783 --> 00:42:02,843
You take 'em out, you pay for everything,
and you never make a move!

710
00:42:02,953 --> 00:42:06,889
Then you home, aIone, to masturbate
whiIe you cry, using your own tears-

711
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:11,724
That was once, and I was drunk
and it was VaIentine's day. So back off.

712
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:15,697
Don't try to candy coat it.
AII we ever do is hang out and have sex.

713
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:20,395
What are you taIking about? Didn't I take you
to the movies Iast week, huh? Huh?

714
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:23,166
Yeah, but you kept trying
to get me to jerk you off.

715
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:27,868
What do you want?
It was a duII movie.

716
00:42:27,978 --> 00:42:32,711
Yeah, but I just get the feeIing
that you don't care.

717
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:36,185
I don't care?
I don't care?

718
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:41,453
When my uncIe died, didn't I ask
you to be by my side at the funeraI?

719
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:45,393
Yeah, but you kept trying
to get me to jerk you off.

720
00:42:48,332 --> 00:42:50,664
How many times can we have
the same exact conversation?

721
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:52,963
It's Iike we're stuck
in a time paradox

722
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,538
where neither our wisdom nor your virginity
wiII ever escape.

723
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:58,608
I attempt to make a move.

724
00:42:58,709 --> 00:43:02,110
I get in cIose.
I'm there and I just get-

725
00:43:02,212 --> 00:43:03,338
Fuck!

726
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:07,042
- You need therapy.
- Hush, now.

727
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:09,984
The way I see it, with chicks,

728
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:12,817
there's reaIIy onIy two possibIe things
that couId happen.

729
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:16,984
Either they won't sIeep with you,
and then there's no need to caII them again,

730
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:21,155
or they do sIeep with you, and then
there's no need to caII them again.

731
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:25,292
This is what I don't get. How can someone
be such a compIete asshoIe aII the time

732
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:27,302
and get as many women
as you do?

733
00:43:27,404 --> 00:43:29,838
That's a good question.

734
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:34,069
- Amy! Serena! CaIvin needs our heIp.
- No.

735
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:36,305
- No, I don't need heIp.
- Shh, shh.

736
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:38,313
Women Iike asshoIes,
am I right?

737
00:43:38,415 --> 00:43:41,407
- WeII, I agree that you're an asshoIe.
- Okay.

738
00:43:41,518 --> 00:43:45,682
''A'', fuck you.
''B'', just answer the question.

739
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:49,657
WeII, okay. GirIs Iike asshoIes,
not women.

740
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,786
What women are attracted to
is seIf-confidence.

741
00:43:52,896 --> 00:43:55,763
Yes, and we absoIuteIy
fucking hate insecurity.

742
00:43:55,866 --> 00:43:58,130
Yes! The more insecure you are
the more you ask, ''Is something wrong?''

743
00:43:58,235 --> 00:44:00,066
- ''Is everything okay?''
- ''What are you thinking about?''

744
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:02,570
''What's wrong?''
And the more you do that, CaIvin,

745
00:44:02,673 --> 00:44:05,164
the more it becomes
this seIf-fuIfiIIing prophecy.

746
00:44:05,275 --> 00:44:08,938
You just need to reIax
and not worry so much. Okay?

747
00:44:12,182 --> 00:44:15,015
Yeah. That makes
a Iot of sense.

748
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:18,350
- I'm gonna work on it.
- Yeah. Yeah, you do that.

749
00:44:18,455 --> 00:44:22,824
And by the way, take whatever advice
that she gives you with a big grain of saIt.

750
00:44:22,926 --> 00:44:25,622
Yeah, and take anything that he gives you
with a shot of peniciIIin.

751
00:44:25,729 --> 00:44:28,926
SeriousIy, CaIvin,
do yourseIf a favor.

752
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:31,661
UnIess you're combing the pIayground
for middIe schooIers,

753
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:34,932
don't become an asshoIe
Iike Monty.

754
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:38,770
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but haven't I been inside you?

755
00:44:47,151 --> 00:44:49,085
- Oh, Monty.
- Oh, me.

756
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:52,986
You wanna brag about your sexuaI conquests,
you big stud, you?

757
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:55,820
Okay, you know what? Fine.
Let's taIk about it.

758
00:44:55,926 --> 00:44:59,623
Let me describe Monty's
amazing sexuaI prowess.

759
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:03,826
He'd barreI into me with that pathetic excuse
for a chiId's penis.

760
00:45:03,934 --> 00:45:07,995
And it wouId end so quickIy,
so abruptIy,

761
00:45:08,105 --> 00:45:10,573
I wouIdn't even have time
to feeI any sort of

762
00:45:10,674 --> 00:45:14,303
morbid, accidentaI amusement
towards his ''technique,''

763
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:16,641
which was basicaIIy him
seizuring on top of me

764
00:45:16,747 --> 00:45:19,113
for, oh, about 45 seconds,

765
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:22,845
whiIe I Iaid there trying
not to Iaugh...or cry.

766
00:45:22,953 --> 00:45:24,011
Ouch.

767
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:27,284
Is it any wonder why you stiII date girIs
in high schooI?

768
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:29,882
They're the onIy ones Ieft.
They don't know any better.

769
00:45:29,993 --> 00:45:32,223
Okay, okay. AII right.

770
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:34,559
First of aII, for the record,

771
00:45:34,665 --> 00:45:37,759
I aIways had an orgasm
when we had sex.

772
00:45:37,868 --> 00:45:40,530
SecondIy, everybody knows
that I'm oraIIy fixated.

773
00:45:40,637 --> 00:45:43,265
You can't deny that I pIayed your vagina
Iike a vioIin.

774
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:48,106
Oh! As if that somehow negates the fact
that once we got past forepIay,

775
00:45:48,212 --> 00:45:50,806
you turned into the IittIe engine
that couIdn't hoId his Ioad.

776
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:53,041
Oh, what the fuck ever!

777
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:56,244
If I was that bad, then why were
you at my house every night?

778
00:45:56,353 --> 00:45:59,151
AII I had to do was caII
and say, ''Hey. I'm horny.''

779
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,224
And then fucking poof!

780
00:46:01,325 --> 00:46:04,920
As if by some form of sIut magic
you'd appear. Now why is that?

781
00:46:05,028 --> 00:46:08,054
Because at first, I reaIIy
Iiked spending time with you.

782
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:10,725
I thought you were a genuineIy
interesting guy to be around.

783
00:46:10,834 --> 00:46:11,801
Very true.

784
00:46:11,902 --> 00:46:15,201
But eventuaIIy, it aII wore thin.
I reaIized that your personaIity

785
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:17,865
was just one short punctuated
joke after another,

786
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:20,034
much Iike our sex Iife.

787
00:46:20,144 --> 00:46:23,978
And, oh, Monty, do you remember
why we stopped dating?

788
00:46:24,081 --> 00:46:27,312
Yeah, I do.
Because you were oId news.

789
00:46:27,417 --> 00:46:31,410
I was Iooking at other girIs and getting bored.
BasicaIIy, that was why.

790
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:33,615
Yeah, yeah. AII that.

791
00:46:33,724 --> 00:46:35,214
And the fact that I dumped you.

792
00:46:35,325 --> 00:46:37,885
- Wait, I thought you said you dumped-
- Shut up, CaIvin.

793
00:46:37,995 --> 00:46:40,725
I was just trying to Iet you down easy,
but this is buIIshit.

794
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:44,197
We both know that you enjoyed
having sex with me.

795
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:47,134
The onIy reaI pIeasure I ever got
from having sex with you

796
00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:49,000
came from making fun of it
Iater with my friends.

797
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:52,166
- TeII him, Amy.
- It's true. We Iaughed a Iot at your expense.

798
00:46:52,276 --> 00:46:56,610
So you know when you're waIking past
a group of peopIe, you hear them Iaughing,

799
00:46:56,713 --> 00:46:59,841
you sometimes get that paranoid
seIf-conscious feeIing?

800
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:02,919
Maybe they're Iaughing about you
when they're reaIIy not?

801
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:06,251
WeII, in your case,
they reaIIy are.

802
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:24,872
God, I Iove her.

803
00:47:26,543 --> 00:47:28,101
Oh, hello there.

804
00:47:28,212 --> 00:47:31,113
Thank you for joining our family
at Shenaniganz bar and grill.

805
00:47:31,215 --> 00:47:33,979
It is our goal to maintain the absolute
highest standard in all aspects-

806
00:47:34,084 --> 00:47:37,451
Hey, man.
We aII had to watch it.

807
00:47:37,554 --> 00:47:41,115
I'm gonna come back and get you after
the dinner rush. The tape shouId be done then.

808
00:47:41,225 --> 00:47:42,249
CooI?

809
00:47:44,161 --> 00:47:45,924
WeII, I mean, I guess. I-

810
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,758
...of our most sacred
company policies

811
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:50,333
to ensure that you have
all the skills necessary

812
00:47:50,434 --> 00:47:53,892
- to uphold our standard of excellence.
- Shit.

813
00:47:54,004 --> 00:47:57,804
Are you ready? Well, okay.
Follow me.

814
00:47:57,908 --> 00:48:00,172
AII right, men.
This is it.

815
00:48:00,277 --> 00:48:04,407
The time has come. Remember,
product pride. Portion consciousness.

816
00:48:04,514 --> 00:48:06,982
Zero hour is upon us.

817
00:48:07,084 --> 00:48:09,644
Let us seize the day!

818
00:48:09,753 --> 00:48:12,051
Yeah, yeah!
Carpe deez nuts.

819
00:48:12,155 --> 00:48:14,214
God, I can't wait to quit
this job!

820
00:48:25,602 --> 00:48:27,433
Okay, your waiter
wiII be right with you.

821
00:48:27,537 --> 00:48:29,095
Hi there, foIks.
What can I get you to drink?

822
00:48:29,206 --> 00:48:30,935
WouId you Iike to start
with an appetizer?

823
00:48:31,041 --> 00:48:33,441
WouId you Iike a baked potato,
french fries or rice piIaf?

824
00:48:33,543 --> 00:48:36,011
- Order up!
- Is everything prepared okay?

825
00:48:36,113 --> 00:48:38,547
- How about some dessert?
- And here you go, foIks.

826
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:41,379
I hope you enjoyed everything.
I know I did.

827
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:54,427
- Fuck!
- The five-second ruIe! The five-second ruIe!

828
00:48:54,531 --> 00:48:56,396
One, two, three,

829
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:59,196
four, five.

830
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:04,974
A IittIe fIoor spice makes everything nice.
There you go.

831
00:49:06,009 --> 00:49:09,103
Damn, man. We aImost had to switch
to the ten-second ruIe.

832
00:49:11,715 --> 00:49:14,149
You green
snot-beard faggot!

833
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:22,552
Fuck you!

834
00:49:22,659 --> 00:49:26,186
- Oh, no.
- Hang on. I onIy have a smaII order.

835
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:28,992
- I have to put in an appetizer. Goddamn it.
- ChiII the fuck out!

836
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:31,067
WeII, hurry up.

837
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:35,429
Okay, hey, gang.
Listen up.

838
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:37,166
Let's get out there,
take care of our guests.

839
00:49:37,274 --> 00:49:39,674
I know it's getting crazy,
but we can do it. We can do it.

840
00:49:39,776 --> 00:49:42,574
Let's put that extra- just that IittIe extra-
back in extraordinary.

841
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:45,705
Okay. There's no
''me'' in ''team.''

842
00:49:46,717 --> 00:49:47,706
Yeah.

843
00:49:48,852 --> 00:49:50,683
Hey, guys. Which one of these
is medium rare?

844
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:57,459
Shoot. Let's just-

845
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:02,293
Goddamn it!

846
00:50:02,399 --> 00:50:05,425
PIease.

847
00:50:05,535 --> 00:50:08,993
Let me do it.

848
00:50:09,106 --> 00:50:10,937
AII right, you two, Iet's go.

849
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:14,408
Hurry up, or your asses
are fired!

850
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:20,138
So remember, find the solution
before there's a problem.

851
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:23,777
Now let's go take a look at our problem
back in the kitchen.

852
00:50:25,255 --> 00:50:27,280
Come on, guys.
This is buII crap.

853
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:29,951
Where the heII's
my chicken sandwich?

854
00:50:31,728 --> 00:50:33,559
Fuck you, bitch!

855
00:50:33,663 --> 00:50:35,358
What the heII
did I do to you, FIoyd?

856
00:50:35,465 --> 00:50:38,923
Eat at Shenaniganz
enjoy your food

857
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:42,972
Eat at Shenaniganz
Calvin works here

858
00:50:43,073 --> 00:50:44,665
Okay, that's hardIy sanitary.

859
00:50:44,775 --> 00:50:48,176
Hey, Dan. I have a tabIe
that needs to-

860
00:51:14,104 --> 00:51:18,734
Trying to get a feeI for the whoIe
manager thing. You caught me.

861
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:22,300
Do you think you couId get a feeI for it outside?
I need some fresh air.

862
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:27,577
Hey, hey, Christy.
It's CaIvin again. I-

863
00:51:29,386 --> 00:51:32,651
Just caIIing again.
Just checking in or whatever.

864
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:35,782
CaIIed before a few times.
Maybe you didn't-

865
00:51:35,892 --> 00:51:37,291
I got aII my bars.

866
00:51:37,394 --> 00:51:39,555
So anyway, it's getting
kind of busy.

867
00:51:39,663 --> 00:51:42,359
But I'm never too busy
to caII you.

868
00:51:42,466 --> 00:51:46,960
So caII me back. You know the number.
Okay. Bye.

869
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:48,367
Fuck.

870
00:51:49,906 --> 00:51:53,398
So is everything okay?
Is something wrong?

871
00:51:55,479 --> 00:51:56,912
Are you mad?

872
00:52:00,984 --> 00:52:02,611
Yeah?

873
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:06,780
Somethin' bad happens
when you become a manager.

874
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:11,054
You put on your fuckin' tie, and you get
your fuckin' IittIe manager card,

875
00:52:11,161 --> 00:52:13,561
and you're think you're so fuckin' cooI
because you write the scheduIe

876
00:52:13,663 --> 00:52:15,324
and teII us what to do.

877
00:52:15,432 --> 00:52:18,424
When in reaIity, you know you're not even
worth a bit of buIIshit!

878
00:52:18,535 --> 00:52:20,469
Whoa, Naomi!

879
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:22,595
ReIax.

880
00:52:22,706 --> 00:52:26,039
ReIax, woman.

881
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:30,910
I guess if you become manager, you won't
be abIe to date any of the waitresses.

882
00:52:31,181 --> 00:52:34,582
While working here, you'll probably find some
of your fellow employees attractive.

883
00:52:34,684 --> 00:52:38,745
It's okay. There's nothing
wrong with that.

884
00:52:38,855 --> 00:52:41,551
But it's important
not to act on those urges.

885
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:45,059
For Shenaniganz to run like an efficient,
well-oiled machine,

886
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:48,598
it's a must that
everyone act as a team.

887
00:52:48,698 --> 00:52:52,464
And when employees date each other,
unfortunately, it complicates things.

888
00:52:52,569 --> 00:52:53,900
So for that reason

889
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:57,770
we strongly discourage
such relationships from forming.

890
00:52:57,874 --> 00:53:00,900
- Dean, Amy, I just sat you.
- Oh, shit. What do we got?

891
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:04,105
WeII, yours are cooI.
They Iook Iike business peopIe.

892
00:53:04,214 --> 00:53:06,205
- AII right.
- What about mine?

893
00:53:06,316 --> 00:53:08,511
I don't know.
They don't speak EngIish.

894
00:53:08,618 --> 00:53:10,176
- Foreigners!
- I'm sorry.

895
00:53:10,287 --> 00:53:14,986
- Are you mad at me?
- No, I swear. I'm just going by the rotation.

896
00:53:15,091 --> 00:53:20,393
I fuckin' hate foreigners!
It's such buIIshit!

897
00:53:20,497 --> 00:53:22,158
Like they don't know how to tip?
Oh, they know.

898
00:53:22,265 --> 00:53:24,256
Aw, yeah, they fuckin' know.

899
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:28,633
AII right.
It's time to show the goat.

900
00:53:33,677 --> 00:53:36,305
You could cut through shoes
if you had to.

901
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:39,940
- I mean-
- What are you doing, man?

902
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,143
FrontIine stuff. Watch this.
Watch this.

903
00:53:42,252 --> 00:53:44,914
We have just been cutting things
90 to nothing.

904
00:53:45,021 --> 00:53:47,649
And the cooks, they just
love it because every time-

905
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:54,261
Hey, there, foIks. My name is Amy,
and I'II be taking care of you.

906
00:53:59,202 --> 00:54:02,467
- Sir, what can I get for you?
- I'd Iike a New York strip, mid rare,

907
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:05,439
and a baked potato with
sour cream and chives onIy.

908
00:54:05,542 --> 00:54:08,511
And- Hey. You're not
writing any of this down.

909
00:54:08,612 --> 00:54:12,275
Oh. SteeI-trap.

910
00:54:12,382 --> 00:54:14,316
You got the baby back ribs
with fries,

911
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:17,716
you got the Mandingo chicken with rice
and a saIad with a side of bIue cheese.

912
00:54:17,821 --> 00:54:20,289
I respect
the Iactose intoIerance.

913
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:22,551
Okay. Okay, you're good.

914
00:54:28,331 --> 00:54:32,893
HaIey is so fuckin' fine, you know I be aII up
in that shit. Give her the bowIing baII grip.

915
00:54:33,003 --> 00:54:36,495
Two in the pink,
one in the stink.

916
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:44,107
You guys are so one-dimensionaI.

917
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:48,080
WeII, fuck you, whitey.

918
00:54:49,386 --> 00:54:53,152
I just sat you.
You're gonna Iove them.

919
00:55:02,565 --> 00:55:05,796
Hey, there, Iadies.
My name is Monty.

920
00:55:18,048 --> 00:55:21,040
Hey, FIoyd, make sure there's no bacon
on that chef saIad. It's against her reIigion.

921
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:23,745
- AII right?
- Yes, master. Right away, master.

922
00:55:23,853 --> 00:55:26,048
Ain't gonna be no bacon
on the saIad, master.

923
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:30,593
No bacon. Oh, no, no.
Oh, no, no. PIease. Oh.

924
00:55:30,694 --> 00:55:33,128
Oh, no.

925
00:55:33,229 --> 00:55:35,561
No bacon on the salad

926
00:55:43,106 --> 00:55:47,975
So, is there anything eIse
I can get you foIks this evening?

927
00:55:48,078 --> 00:55:51,445
I think I'd Iike
a hot fudge sundae.

928
00:55:55,318 --> 00:55:58,719
That does sound good.
I'II be right back with that for you.

929
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:04,858
Like that bitch needs to be
eating dessert anyway.

930
00:56:07,564 --> 00:56:11,523
You know, if you ever want counseIing
in anger management or...

931
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:18,231
aIcohoIism, I'd be more
than gIad to do it for you.

932
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:22,803
You'd do that for me?

933
00:56:26,483 --> 00:56:29,919
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

934
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:33,955
But I think I'd rather you just
wash the fucking dishes

935
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:36,548
and shut the fuck up!

936
00:56:36,659 --> 00:56:41,289
Fucking psychobabbIe-buIIshit
asshoIe!

937
00:56:42,665 --> 00:56:45,998
Fuckin' bitch.
Son of a bitch, cocksucker.

938
00:56:46,102 --> 00:56:49,128
Fuckin', I hate her.
I hate her!

939
00:57:03,553 --> 00:57:06,044
Fuckin' Nick and T-dog!

940
00:57:18,802 --> 00:57:23,501
That is why we are always on guard
for guests. You never know when-

941
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:27,702
- Shit.
- So you have to make sure they-

942
00:57:28,745 --> 00:57:31,373
Fuck! Man, no!

943
00:57:31,581 --> 00:57:34,778
If we're gonna beat Iast year's numbers,
I need you to be more hands-on.

944
00:57:34,884 --> 00:57:37,751
I need you to be sure things
don't faII through the cracks.

945
00:57:37,854 --> 00:57:40,482
BasicaIIy, I need you
to be more Iike Dean here.

946
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:44,151
I question whether you can
see that by me serving food,

947
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:46,751
but thank you anyway.

948
00:57:46,863 --> 00:57:49,855
- How is everything, guys?
- Everything's perfect.

949
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:51,263
You're a master of your craft.

950
00:57:51,367 --> 00:57:53,460
Thanks.

951
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:56,368
You keep this up, I may just try
to Iure you away from this pIace.

952
00:57:57,874 --> 00:57:59,933
AII right.
WeII, thank you, sir.

953
00:58:00,043 --> 00:58:03,171
Let me know if
you need anything, guys.

954
00:58:03,279 --> 00:58:07,545
You're probably wondering what makes
Shenaniganz such a great restaurant.

955
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:10,414
So I thought I'd share with you
a few key examples

956
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,818
of why we've had so much success.

957
00:58:13,623 --> 00:58:16,922
First of all,
our entres are always cooked

958
00:58:17,026 --> 00:58:19,494
exquisitely to perfection.

959
00:58:19,596 --> 00:58:22,793
Our deserts were designed
by gourmet chefs.

960
00:58:22,899 --> 00:58:26,062
We always treat our guests
with respect and dignity.

961
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:27,761
Did you see the tits
on tabIe 12?

962
00:58:27,871 --> 00:58:30,396
We treat each other
with respect and dignity.

963
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:31,974
Fuckin'-ass pervert!

964
00:58:32,075 --> 00:58:36,842
Remember, the difference between ordinary
and extraordinary

965
00:58:36,946 --> 00:58:38,777
is that little extra.

966
00:58:38,882 --> 00:58:43,945
The penis just Iooks ridicuIous.
It's Iike a shriveIed roII of dimes or something.

967
00:58:44,053 --> 00:58:45,748
I know. It's a joke.

968
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:47,789
- She's in Iove.
- Hey, TyIa.

969
00:58:47,891 --> 00:58:50,883
You gonna taIk to your girIfriend aII night
or make my drink?

970
00:59:00,403 --> 00:59:03,668
That's okay.
I understand how it works.

971
00:59:03,773 --> 00:59:07,470
Birds of a feather
fIock to vagina.

972
00:59:16,252 --> 00:59:18,812
Get off your ass and get heIp!

973
00:59:18,922 --> 00:59:20,549
You want some heIp, bitch?

974
00:59:24,127 --> 00:59:26,118
Here you go.

975
00:59:28,831 --> 00:59:31,322
Theodore! What the heck
are you doing?

976
00:59:31,434 --> 00:59:35,131
How many times I toId you?
My name is T-dog, bitch!

977
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:39,675
My name is T-dog, bitch!
My name is T-dog, bitch!

978
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:45,442
Hey, sweetie. It's aImost 9:00.
I just came to say good-bye.

979
00:59:47,283 --> 00:59:48,773
Hey, baby.

980
00:59:48,885 --> 00:59:51,854
You wanna go in the car
and have a IittIe sex?

981
01:00:01,731 --> 01:00:06,191
So what if there's pIenty of parking spaces?
It's the principIe of the matter.

982
01:00:06,302 --> 01:00:09,032
Hey, you're preaching to the choir here.
Know what I mean?

983
01:00:09,138 --> 01:00:12,630
The Iord giveth, the Iord taketh away.

984
01:00:12,742 --> 01:00:14,004
Damn, come on.

985
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:21,542
What the fuck?

986
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:26,180
Here you go, sir. Once again,
I hope you enjoyed everything.

987
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:27,483
- Thanks.
- See you guys.

988
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:30,115
Dean, I wanna teII you,
you did an extraordinary job.

989
01:00:30,226 --> 01:00:31,750
Oh, thank you, sir.

990
01:00:31,861 --> 01:00:34,125
- How oId are you?
- I'm 22.

991
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:36,926
WeII, you're obviousIy
a very inteIIigent young man.

992
01:00:37,033 --> 01:00:39,467
Let me give you my card.

993
01:00:39,569 --> 01:00:42,129
Ever get tired of this pIace,
you're Iooking for a new opportunity,

994
01:00:42,238 --> 01:00:44,468
- you give me a caII.
- AII right.

995
01:00:44,574 --> 01:00:46,872
Thank you, sir.
I honestIy appreciate that.

996
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:49,843
Great. AII right.
Have a good night, guys.

997
01:00:49,946 --> 01:00:51,743
Thanks again. Thank you.

998
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:55,811
WeII, I hope he caIIs.

999
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:12,399
Mama said they's my magic shoes.

1000
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:14,333
Mama said they'd
take me anywhere.

1001
01:01:14,437 --> 01:01:17,668
Of course, Mama used to beat me
with a rubber hose, caII me a retard.

1002
01:01:17,774 --> 01:01:20,675
Dude, pIease stop.
Stop. Okay?

1003
01:01:20,777 --> 01:01:23,769
I appreciate what
you're trying to do. I do.

1004
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:27,816
But, dude, I'm reaIIy not in the mood
for smiIing, aII right?

1005
01:01:27,917 --> 01:01:29,077
Okay.

1006
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:31,449
- What?
- The oId Iady at tabIe 37 wants you to sing

1007
01:01:31,554 --> 01:01:33,112
the birthday song
for her grandson.

1008
01:01:33,222 --> 01:01:36,350
His name is Timmy,
and he's eight years old.

1009
01:01:37,927 --> 01:01:39,519
I need birthday singers!

1010
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:43,224
- Come on, peopIe! We need birthday singers!
- Fuck.

1011
01:01:48,171 --> 01:01:51,663
There he is.
There's the big winner.

1012
01:01:51,774 --> 01:01:54,334
- Yeah!
- Hey.

1013
01:01:54,444 --> 01:01:56,708
AII right. Attention, guests!

1014
01:01:56,813 --> 01:02:02,012
Today's a very speciaI occasion.
It's Timmy's eighth birthday!

1015
01:02:02,118 --> 01:02:05,679
Big round of appIause.
He's earned it.

1016
01:02:05,788 --> 01:02:08,222
He's got his whoIe Iife ahead of him.
The sky's the Iimit.

1017
01:02:08,324 --> 01:02:10,588
I don't know but I've been told

1018
01:02:10,693 --> 01:02:12,490
Someone here is getting old

1019
01:02:12,595 --> 01:02:14,563
Good news is dessert is free

1020
01:02:14,664 --> 01:02:16,529
Bad news is we sing off-key

1021
01:02:16,632 --> 01:02:18,497
Happy birthday

1022
01:02:18,601 --> 01:02:20,125
To you

1023
01:02:25,274 --> 01:02:29,370
- Look at the camera!
- Picture time.

1024
01:02:31,781 --> 01:02:34,272
- AII right. AII right.
- Cry it off.

1025
01:02:34,383 --> 01:02:36,817
WeII, we can't go
in the parking Iot.

1026
01:02:37,854 --> 01:02:40,288
Can't go anywhere
in the kitchen.

1027
01:02:42,225 --> 01:02:44,318
WeII, maybe we couId-

1028
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:46,827
We are not having sex
in the bathroom.

1029
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:49,022
- But-
- No. No way. Forget it.

1030
01:02:51,501 --> 01:02:55,699
Oh. Come on, baby.

1031
01:02:57,273 --> 01:02:59,537
Come on.

1032
01:03:02,478 --> 01:03:03,570
Okay.

1033
01:03:04,881 --> 01:03:08,146
- Okay, but this is the Iast time.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1034
01:03:09,919 --> 01:03:12,319
So where do you girIs
go to coIIege?

1035
01:03:14,090 --> 01:03:15,990
ActuaIIy, we're stiII
in high schooI.

1036
01:03:16,092 --> 01:03:19,255
You're kidding.
How oId are you girIs?

1037
01:03:19,362 --> 01:03:21,057
Sixteen.

1038
01:03:21,164 --> 01:03:22,927
Wow.

1039
01:03:23,032 --> 01:03:28,868
You Iook a Iot oIder than that.
I wouId've guessed 19, 20, maybe 21.

1040
01:03:28,971 --> 01:03:30,768
Yeah, we get that a Iot.

1041
01:03:34,043 --> 01:03:36,443
Here. Let me give you
a hand with that.

1042
01:03:36,546 --> 01:03:39,014
It's the stupid chiIdproof Iighters.

1043
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:44,878
Hey, Bishop. Can I taIk
to you about something?

1044
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:46,545
Yeah, sure. Have a seat.

1045
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:48,214
Thanks.

1046
01:03:51,427 --> 01:03:54,624
AII right, so I went
to my mother's this morning.

1047
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:57,096
You've been working here, what?
About a year and four months, right?

1048
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:00,033
Yeah, I guess. About.

1049
01:04:00,136 --> 01:04:04,334
- But anyway, we have a good reIationship-
- About three years ago,

1050
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:07,637
this restaurant went through
quite a Iow point.

1051
01:04:07,743 --> 01:04:11,144
Okay, I'm sorry. Did you wanna hear
what I was gonna say or-

1052
01:04:11,247 --> 01:04:15,081
PIease. See, the store moraIe
was beginning to sIip.

1053
01:04:15,184 --> 01:04:17,709
CIienteIe base began
dropping off.

1054
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:19,947
That of course, Ied to Iower tips,
which in time,

1055
01:04:20,056 --> 01:04:22,024
Ied to an even Iower
store moraIe.

1056
01:04:22,124 --> 01:04:26,754
BasicaIIy, the entire restaurant was going
through quite a downward spiraI.

1057
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:28,922
Okay.

1058
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:32,194
Then Raddimus began
working here.

1059
01:04:32,301 --> 01:04:36,135
And with him came the penis-showin' game
you aII Iike to pIay.

1060
01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:40,608
Okay, I- Why are you
teIIing me this?

1061
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:42,974
Restaurant began to improve.

1062
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:47,641
EmpIoyees started having more fun at work.
They started joking around a Iot more,

1063
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:50,844
which Ied to a raise in the cIienteIe base,
higher tips

1064
01:04:50,953 --> 01:04:52,580
and so on and so forth.

1065
01:04:52,688 --> 01:04:56,749
Yeah, I stiII don't understand, Bishop.

1066
01:04:56,859 --> 01:04:58,554
Point is,

1067
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:02,994
the penis-showin' game
became a cataIyst

1068
01:05:03,099 --> 01:05:06,068
for the change necessary
to be made in the restaurant.

1069
01:05:07,436 --> 01:05:12,601
So, when things in your Iife
become stagnant.

1070
01:05:12,708 --> 01:05:16,838
You know, you're no Ionger happy
with what you're doing.

1071
01:05:16,946 --> 01:05:20,313
Then you figure out
what's important to you.

1072
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:24,853
Then create your own
penis-showin' game.

1073
01:05:25,988 --> 01:05:28,320
MetaphoricaIIy speaking,
that is.

1074
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:33,760
Okay. Okay, thanks, Bishop.

1075
01:05:37,133 --> 01:05:42,070
So do you think taking the assistant manager
job wouId be Iike my penis-showing game?

1076
01:05:42,171 --> 01:05:44,071
Is that what you're saying?

1077
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:49,138
Okay.

1078
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:52,877
Where the heII is it?
It's been over haIf an hour!

1079
01:05:52,982 --> 01:05:55,382
ToId you it'd be up in a minute!
Get out of my face or I'II Iose your ticket!

1080
01:05:55,484 --> 01:05:58,885
What? What do you want?
Get back to the training room, you ass cock!

1081
01:05:58,988 --> 01:06:02,719
Goddamn it! I hate these fuckin' cooks.
I hate them!

1082
01:06:02,825 --> 01:06:05,453
Twenty minutes for two medium-rare steaks?
This is buIIshit.

1083
01:06:05,561 --> 01:06:09,964
What the heII? They need to get rid of every
singIe one of these Iousy cocksucking mother-

1084
01:06:10,066 --> 01:06:12,728
So how is everything?

1085
01:06:16,706 --> 01:06:18,230
Give me a caII
when you get this.

1086
01:06:18,341 --> 01:06:21,367
Can you bring this to tabIe 75?
I gotta try to take a piss.

1087
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:25,004
- Okay, good Iuck.
- Thanks.

1088
01:06:25,114 --> 01:06:28,550
Okay, so how wouId you Iike
your steak prepared?

1089
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:32,178
Oh, Iet's see.
Medium, medium-rare.

1090
01:06:32,288 --> 01:06:35,780
WeII, I want a hot, pink center.

1091
01:06:35,891 --> 01:06:37,688
Don't we aII?

1092
01:06:39,862 --> 01:06:42,592
AII right. Do you know
what you guys want?

1093
01:06:42,698 --> 01:06:46,190
- I'd Iike a tossed saIad, pIease.
- Oh, you're bad.

1094
01:06:46,302 --> 01:06:48,361
Yo, girI, give me
the instant camera.

1095
01:06:48,471 --> 01:06:51,907
Yo, there's a birthday party in the kitchen.
We're gonna take a picture.

1096
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:54,636
Bus tabIe 73 first,
and then I'II give you the camera.

1097
01:06:54,744 --> 01:06:57,042
Yeah, whatever.

1098
01:06:57,146 --> 01:06:59,341
Ma'am, I don't doubt
the steak was overcooked,

1099
01:06:59,448 --> 01:07:02,110
but did you have to eat it aII
before you compIained about it?

1100
01:07:02,218 --> 01:07:05,745
It's too bad chIamydia has to be a venereaI
disease. It's such a pIeasant-sounding word.

1101
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:07,618
- ChIamydia?
- ChIamydia.

1102
01:07:07,723 --> 01:07:10,988
ChIamydia. I think I might
name my daughter ChIamydia.

1103
01:07:11,093 --> 01:07:15,257
Okay, he wanted the jumbo shrimp
with baked potato, and she wanted the-

1104
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:17,229
Fuck. What did she order?

1105
01:07:17,333 --> 01:07:18,698
- I can't.
- Hothead.

1106
01:07:20,636 --> 01:07:24,265
Hi. Here's your change.
I hope you guys have a reaIIy nice evening.

1107
01:07:40,456 --> 01:07:45,359
- Fuck.
- Hurry up. Come on.

1108
01:07:45,461 --> 01:07:46,860
What's taking so Iong?

1109
01:07:46,962 --> 01:07:48,691
Shh. I'm trying to concentrate.

1110
01:07:48,798 --> 01:07:50,493
Somebody here?

1111
01:07:50,599 --> 01:07:52,032
Hurry up.

1112
01:07:52,134 --> 01:07:53,533
This is crazy.

1113
01:07:53,636 --> 01:07:54,967
Shh, shh, shh.

1114
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:56,595
No, no. Stop. Stop.

1115
01:07:56,705 --> 01:07:59,936
- Here we go.
- Oh, God!

1116
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:07,315
- My fuckin' man! Yeah, man!
- You Iike that?

1117
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:09,509
Yo, give me the fucking picture back.

1118
01:08:37,446 --> 01:08:40,973
So, what are you doing tonight?

1119
01:08:41,083 --> 01:08:43,415
Oh, I'm sure I'II end up
at the party.

1120
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:46,248
Oh, yeah?

1121
01:08:49,892 --> 01:08:51,519
Do you-

1122
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:54,929
Do you think I-

1123
01:08:56,031 --> 01:08:58,556
- You wanna come to the party?
- WeII, yeah.

1124
01:08:58,667 --> 01:09:02,763
Those guys, they aIways seem to forget
to teII me where it's at.

1125
01:09:02,872 --> 01:09:06,603
Okay. As soon as
I find out where it is,

1126
01:09:06,709 --> 01:09:09,735
I'II make sure
to give you directions.

1127
01:09:09,845 --> 01:09:15,340
WeII, then. Tonight shouId be a good night
for both of us, huh?

1128
01:09:20,789 --> 01:09:22,757
OnIy 30 more minutes
to go, man.

1129
01:09:22,858 --> 01:09:26,055
We better not have no Iate-night asshoIe
comin' in here.

1130
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:27,925
So how'd y'aII do tonight?

1131
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:31,625
- I made about 70.
- 86.

1132
01:09:31,734 --> 01:09:34,362
I made 67 on a doubIe.

1133
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:36,961
Oh, God.
How pissed are you?

1134
01:09:37,072 --> 01:09:39,472
- How much did you make?
- A biII.

1135
01:09:39,575 --> 01:09:44,035
I never make- How do you make
a hundred doIIars every night?

1136
01:09:44,146 --> 01:09:45,477
- You wanna know?
- Yeah.

1137
01:09:45,581 --> 01:09:48,448
You reaIIy wanna know how I make
a hundred doIIars every night?

1138
01:09:48,551 --> 01:09:51,452
- Yes.
- It's aII about that right there.

1139
01:09:53,722 --> 01:09:55,349
Yes!

1140
01:09:55,457 --> 01:09:56,947
Yes!

1141
01:09:57,059 --> 01:09:58,822
Monty with the assist!

1142
01:09:58,928 --> 01:10:01,089
I can't beIieve how many homos
we got working in here.

1143
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:04,428
It's crazy.
Mitch, cherry-popping time.

1144
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:07,502
Okay, Monty, my bitch.
Kick me a fieId goaI.

1145
01:10:07,603 --> 01:10:09,332
You know what?
I don't understand.

1146
01:10:09,438 --> 01:10:13,204
You pIot and you scheme on how to
get the other person to Iook at your goat

1147
01:10:13,309 --> 01:10:15,140
or chicken wing or whatever.

1148
01:10:15,244 --> 01:10:18,179
And then when he Iooks,
you caII him a fag.

1149
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:22,182
It's Iike it's an exercise
in retarded homophobic futiIity.

1150
01:10:22,284 --> 01:10:23,979
You know you girIs Iove it.

1151
01:10:24,086 --> 01:10:28,045
So, seriousIy, Iadies,
why don't you wanna pIay the game?

1152
01:10:28,157 --> 01:10:30,318
I reaIIy think that we'd be wiIIing
to amend the ruIes for you.

1153
01:10:30,426 --> 01:10:33,827
- Oh, yeah. I bet you wouId.
- No girI wouId ever pIay that game.

1154
01:10:33,929 --> 01:10:34,987
Why not?

1155
01:10:35,097 --> 01:10:36,655
- You wanna know why?
- Yeah.

1156
01:10:36,765 --> 01:10:38,995
- You reaIIy wanna know why?
- I reaIIy do.

1157
01:10:39,101 --> 01:10:42,161
Okay. I'II teII you why.

1158
01:10:42,271 --> 01:10:44,831
- It's because of this!
- Oh!

1159
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:47,500
Oh, yeah. Bang.
Pow! Pow! Pow!

1160
01:10:47,610 --> 01:10:49,475
It's so angry!

1161
01:10:50,312 --> 01:10:52,906
Oh, God.
Does that thing have its shots?

1162
01:10:53,015 --> 01:10:57,145
- Put it away. Put it away.
- Dinner is served!

1163
01:10:57,953 --> 01:10:59,181
Oh, my God.

1164
01:10:59,288 --> 01:11:03,281
WeII, it's officiaI.
Now my penis is just for show.

1165
01:11:03,392 --> 01:11:06,088
Mitch, you picked a fucked-up night
to start working here.

1166
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:08,628
- Oh, my God.
- Bend over, boys.

1167
01:11:08,731 --> 01:11:11,666

1204
01:13:33,342 --> 01:13:38,370
Anyway. Yeah. I just started my new career.
They're starting me off at 48,000 a year.

1205
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:40,414
Wow. Wow.

1206
01:13:40,516 --> 01:13:43,383
Yeah, I've been Iooking at houses.
It's reaIIy exciting.

1207
01:13:43,485 --> 01:13:44,679
I'II bet.

1208
01:13:44,787 --> 01:13:47,813
- So what have you been doing?

1209
01:13:47,923 --> 01:13:51,757

1210
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:55,591
And I'm stiII finishing up at C.C.,
taking a few more cIasses.

1211
01:13:55,697 --> 01:13:58,359
I was actuaIIy thinking about
taking an assistant manager-

1212
01:13:58,467 --> 01:14:00,230
CouId I get some more tea?

1213
01:14:01,937 --> 01:14:04,599
Sure. Yeah.

01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:22,348
Okay, Dan,
I'm just Ieaving now.

1217
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:25,188
But here are the directions
to the party.

1218
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:27,524
What time are you coming over?

1219
01:14:27,629 --> 01:14:29,688
I shouId be out of here soon.

1220
01:14:29,798 --> 01:14:31,527

01:14:31,633 --> 01:14:33,931

1222
01:14:34,036 --> 01:14:35,230
Okay.

1223
01:14:35,337 --> 01:14:39,296
I just wanna warn you,
I might be reaIIy drunk tonight.

1224
01:14:39,408 --> 01:14:41,376
I hope you won't
think Iess of me.

1225
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:43,775
No. No, I'm not.

1226
01:14:43,879 --> 01:14:45,471
I won't.

1227
01:14:45,581 --> 01:14:48,516
Okay. WeII, I'II see you there.

1228
01:14:55,724 --> 01:14:56,748
Fuck.

1229
01:14:59,061 --> 01:15:01,461
- Dean, reaIIy, it's-
- No.

1230
01:15:01,563 --> 01:15:03,360
It's what?

1231
01:15:07,636 --> 01:15:10,230
Here you go, Chet.
It was nice seeing you again.

1232
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:13,137
Yeah, you too, Dean.
Listen.

1233
01:15:13,242 --> 01:15:15,767
You take care of yourseIf.

01:15:17,179 --> 01:15:19,272
You too. Okay.

1235
01:15:32,828 --> 01:15:34,489
How much did he Ieave you?

1236
01:15:36,031 --> 01:15:37,658
He must have made
a mistake.

1237
01:15:52,581 --> 01:15:55,311
Chet, Chet.
I think you made a mistake.

1238
01:15:55,417 --> 01:15:58,250
- You gave me a hundred doIIar biII.
- No, it's aII there.

1239
01:15:58,353 --> 01:16:03,381
- We're straight.
- The check's onIy $31. That's Iike a $70 tip.

1240
01:16:03,492 --> 01:16:07,690
Look, I just thought maybe
you needed it more than I do.

1241
01:16:24,146 --> 01:16:25,670
Hey! Dean.

1242
01:16:28,784 --> 01:16:31,582
Have you thought about it?

1243
01:16:31,687 --> 01:16:33,848
You want that
assistant manager job?

1244
01:16:41,096 --> 01:16:43,496
- 'Weiser?
- No, thanks.

1245
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:55,239
Look-

1246
01:16:56,378 --> 01:16:58,403
HeIIo? Hey, Christy.

1247
01:16:58,513 --> 01:16:59,878
What's up?

1248
01:17:01,149 --> 01:17:02,741
No, I'm not.
No, I was just-

1249
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:06,044
Oh.

1250
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:10,390
Yeah, I'II see you tomorrow, then.

1251
01:17:10,492 --> 01:17:12,756
Okay. Bye. Bye.

1252
01:17:12,861 --> 01:17:14,726
Bye.

1253
01:17:15,897 --> 01:17:20,197
- What's up with Christy?
- Oh, she's-

1254
01:17:20,302 --> 01:17:22,395
She's on a date.

1255
01:17:22,504 --> 01:17:25,098
That's why she wanted me
to cover her shift.

1256
01:17:25,207 --> 01:17:26,970
She's- She's stiII with him.

1257
01:17:27,075 --> 01:17:30,340
God, that's it.

1258
01:17:30,445 --> 01:17:33,346
I'm gonna-
I'm gonna change.

1259
01:17:33,448 --> 01:17:35,040
WeII, good.

1260
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:37,118
You shouId start tonight.

1261
01:17:37,219 --> 01:17:40,916
- Go get one of those high schooI girIs.
- You think?

1262
01:17:41,023 --> 01:17:44,083
Mitch, I want you to know
that you did a reaIIy great job today.

1263
01:17:44,192 --> 01:17:48,686
And you didn't even cry once, which
is more than I can say for my Iast trainee.

1264
01:17:48,797 --> 01:17:53,700
So, honestIy, you think you can
handIe working here?

1265
01:17:55,937 --> 01:17:59,737
- Yeah-
- Hey, fuck off for a second. I'II be right back.

1266
01:18:01,943 --> 01:18:04,468
Hey, whoa. Amy caIIed,
she toId me what happened.

1267
01:18:04,579 --> 01:18:06,809
You know what?
Fuck Chet MiIIer.

1268
01:18:06,915 --> 01:18:08,940
Hey, man, reIax.

1269
01:18:09,051 --> 01:18:10,609
AII right?
ReIax. I'm okay.

1270
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:11,845
You serious?

1271
01:18:11,953 --> 01:18:14,820
- I'd be ready to kiII someone.
- No, you know what?

1272
01:18:14,923 --> 01:18:16,914
I'm gIad he came in.
I reaIIy am.

1273
01:18:17,025 --> 01:18:20,859
Yeah, he was a prick, and at first
I was so fucking pissed off,

1274
01:18:20,962 --> 01:18:23,089
but it was weird.

1275
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:26,725
In one second, it aII just kind
of snapped into perspective.

1276
01:18:26,835 --> 01:18:30,327
PIease, eIaborate.
Did you taIk to Dan?

1277
01:18:30,439 --> 01:18:33,875
Do you want
the assistant manager job?

1278
01:18:34,976 --> 01:18:35,943
No.

1279
01:18:37,212 --> 01:18:38,338
I quit.

1280
01:18:38,447 --> 01:18:40,176
What?

1281
01:18:40,282 --> 01:18:43,274
You know, I thought about it.
I thought a Iot about it

1282
01:18:43,385 --> 01:18:45,910
and I know I don't wanna
wait tabIes anymore.

1283
01:18:46,021 --> 01:18:47,784
This is aII temporary.

1284
01:18:47,889 --> 01:18:49,823
This is supposed to be
the in-between time.

1285
01:18:49,925 --> 01:18:52,257
If I become an assistant manager,

1286
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:54,760
it's just one more step
towards permanence.

1287
01:18:54,863 --> 01:18:56,387
Fuck that, man.
No way.

1288
01:18:56,498 --> 01:18:59,490
So you've reaIIy...

1289
01:19:03,004 --> 01:19:06,405
What did Dan say
when you toId him you quit?

1290
01:19:06,508 --> 01:19:10,740
You're fIushing a goIden opportunity
down the toiIet.

1291
01:19:10,846 --> 01:19:13,838
And just so you know,
Hot Dog,

1292
01:19:13,949 --> 01:19:17,476
if you do come back,
this job won't be here for you.

1293
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:19,349
- I hope you're right.
- I am right!

1294
01:19:19,454 --> 01:19:22,981
- You're fired!
- I mean, I aIready quit, so-

1295
01:19:23,091 --> 01:19:24,786
No, you're fired!

1296
01:19:24,893 --> 01:19:26,952
I write the book, okay?

1297
01:19:27,062 --> 01:19:29,326
Here's how it went down.
You waIked in-

1298
01:19:29,431 --> 01:19:30,955
You're fired!

1299
01:19:31,066 --> 01:19:34,194
AII right. Then, thanks for being
so mature about this and professionaI.

1300
01:19:34,302 --> 01:19:36,395
I was very professionaI.
You're fired.

1301
01:19:36,505 --> 01:19:37,597
AII right.

1302
01:19:37,706 --> 01:19:40,698
Get out!
Get out of my sight!

1303
01:19:40,909 --> 01:19:43,275
- That's harsh.
- Yeah.

1304
01:19:43,378 --> 01:19:45,744
He'II be cryin' himseIf to sIeep tonight
on his cock-shaped piIIow.

1305
01:19:48,416 --> 01:19:49,906
What are you gonna do now?

1306
01:19:50,018 --> 01:19:51,918
I don't know.

1307
01:19:53,021 --> 01:19:54,648
I don't know.

1308
01:19:55,891 --> 01:19:57,825
I'm definiteIy gonna do somethin'.

1309
01:19:57,926 --> 01:19:59,757
Fuck it.

1310
01:19:59,861 --> 01:20:01,624
Let's go out there,
Iet's ceIebrate,

1311
01:20:01,730 --> 01:20:05,257
Iet's just get totaIIy fucking annihiIated,
hammered-ass drunk

1312
01:20:05,367 --> 01:20:07,562
and then run the train
on Amy.

1313
01:20:07,669 --> 01:20:08,636
Fuck.

1314
01:20:08,737 --> 01:20:10,500
You reaIIy are
an asshoIe, man.

1315
01:20:10,605 --> 01:20:12,402
So I'm toId.

1316
01:20:13,942 --> 01:20:15,409
You're a good friend too.

1317
01:20:15,510 --> 01:20:19,276
Let's just keep that on the DL.
I'm aII about Iow expectations.

1318
01:20:19,381 --> 01:20:21,406

01:20:23,518 --> 01:20:25,418
Oh, by the way, CaI.

1320
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:28,853
I've been thinking about
your pubIic bathroom phobia.

1321
01:20:28,957 --> 01:20:31,084
- Yeah?

1322
01:20:31,193 --> 01:20:33,661

1323
01:20:33,762 --> 01:20:37,163

1324
01:20:37,265 --> 01:20:38,823

1325
01:20:38,934 --> 01:20:41,630
CIose my- Okay.

1326
01:20:42,671 --> 01:20:44,161
Now...

1327
01:20:44,272 --> 01:20:47,537
envision yourseIf
at a bathroom urinaI.

1328
01:20:47,642 --> 01:20:50,770
With everybody you know
crowded around you.

1329
01:20:52,214 --> 01:20:54,444
They're cheering you on.

1330
01:20:54,549 --> 01:20:57,143
They're chanting your name.

1331
01:20:57,252 --> 01:20:59,777
Not only do they
want you to urinate,

1332
01:20:59,888 --> 01:21:01,287
they wanna see it.

1333
01:21:01,389 --> 01:21:04,825
- Proud of you, buddy!

1334
01:21:04,926 --> 01:21:08,020
- Fuckin' piss, man!

1335
01:21:08,129 --> 01:21:10,597
You can do it!

1336
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:12,496
You pissing son of a bitch!

1337
01:21:12,601 --> 01:21:16,560
Now, see yourself

1338
01:21:16,671 --> 01:21:19,799
You can do itl
Do itl

1339
01:21:19,908 --> 01:21:21,671
Do it.

1340
01:21:36,591 --> 01:21:38,456
It's historicl

1341
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:42,257
So, go ahead and visuaI that
for the next few weeks.

1342
01:21:42,364 --> 01:21:44,730
Start off at home first,
by yourseIf.

1343
01:21:44,833 --> 01:21:47,063
Then you can move to a staII,

1344
01:21:47,168 --> 01:21:50,365
and then eventuaIIy
to an actuaI urinaI.

1345
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:53,608
Thanks, Bishop. I mean it.

1346
01:21:53,708 --> 01:21:55,335
That totaIIy makes sense.

1347
01:21:55,443 --> 01:21:58,674
Look, weII, you guys,
I'm feeIin' good.

1348
01:21:58,780 --> 01:22:02,238
You know what? I'm gonna go taIk
to one of those high schooI girIs.

1349
01:22:02,350 --> 01:22:04,375
- WeII, good Iuck with that.
- Thank you.

1350
01:22:13,128 --> 01:22:15,062
So, what grade are you in?

1351
01:22:16,965 --> 01:22:19,160
Oh, Iook at that.
A bedroom.

1352
01:22:32,013 --> 01:22:33,071
No.

1353
01:22:33,181 --> 01:22:35,706
What? What do you mean?

1354
01:22:35,817 --> 01:22:39,082
You start pIaying this weird, ambivaIence
buIIshit, and it makes me feeI psycho.

1355
01:22:39,187 --> 01:22:40,586
And I never get psycho!

1356
01:22:40,689 --> 01:22:42,213
I know.

1357
01:22:43,458 --> 01:22:45,926
So I need you
to do me a favor.

1358
01:22:46,027 --> 01:22:48,461
I need you to not be
such a pussy.

1359
01:22:48,563 --> 01:22:51,930
Wow, there's the sass
that I was missin'.

1360
01:22:52,033 --> 01:22:55,127
- You're a fIake.
- I know I'm a fIake!

1361
01:22:55,236 --> 01:22:57,397
- Fuck you!
- You can't even get a boner.

1362
01:22:57,505 --> 01:22:59,302
Whoa, sorry to interrupt.

1363
01:22:59,407 --> 01:23:01,637
Wait. Hey, Bishop.

1364
01:23:01,743 --> 01:23:04,405
I created my own
penis-showing game.

1365
01:23:06,381 --> 01:23:08,042
So you quit your job.

1366
01:23:09,150 --> 01:23:10,640
How'd you know I quit?

1367
01:23:15,056 --> 01:23:16,353
Wow.

1368
01:23:21,730 --> 01:23:23,220
Are you okay?

1369
01:23:24,265 --> 01:23:25,926
Is somethin' wrong?

1370
01:23:28,803 --> 01:23:31,169
Just checking.

1371
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:47,452
Wait. Wait, wait.

1372
01:23:48,523 --> 01:23:50,081

1374
01:23:55,463 --> 01:23:57,397
Yeah.

1375
01:23:57,499 --> 01:23:59,023
Okay, then-

1376

Why? Do you think
I'm gonna turn you in?

1380
01:24:10,712 --> 01:24:13,340
- You think you're going to get arrested?
- No, no, no.

1381
01:24:13,448 --> 01:24:17,350
I just- I feeI Iike

1382
01:24:17,452 --> 01:24:19,147

1384
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:26,793
Okay.

1385

Twice!

1388

So, Mitch, how was

01:30:36,998 --> 01:30:39,228
My mom tries to ground me
I'm gonna slap her

1475
01:30:39,333 --> 01:30:41,665
I'll fuckin' cap her
Don't she know I'm a rapper

1476
01:30:41,769 --> 01:30:44,237
I don't care about love
Fuck amore

1477
01:30:44,338 --> 01:30:46,397
Fuck the dumb whore-ay
All day

1478
01:30:46,507 --> 01:30:49,374
And then suck my dick
all in its glory

1479
01:30:49,477 --> 01:30:51,707
Swallow my nut
This shit is gourmet

1480
01:30:51,813 --> 01:30:54,373
I'm hor-nay but you
fuckin' sluts bore me

1481
01:30:54,482 --> 01:30:56,848
So fuck you, bitch
I'll fuck your mama

1482
01:30:56,951 --> 01:30:59,442
Then I'll kill your papa
to top the drama

1483
01:30:59,554 --> 01:31:01,818
Then I'll rape a llama
to top that drama

1484
01:31:01,923 --> 01:31:04,187
I'll eat that pussy
like Jeffrey Dahmer

1485
01:31:04,292 --> 01:31:06,954
I got a gat in my hand
A pound in my tighty-whities

1486
01:31:07,061 --> 01:31:09,461
A hit on my shit
will make your eyes Chinese

1487
01:31:09,564 --> 01:31:12,089
My wallets are thick
and here's the thing, you dumb bitch

1488
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:14,464
Even my come's rich
You fuckin' retard

1489
01:31:14,569 --> 01:31:16,867
I'll pull your fuckin' card
You ready, willin' and able

1490
01:31:16,971 --> 01:31:19,371
You call me fuckin' fake
just because I bus tables

1491
01:31:19,474 --> 01:31:21,271
Fuck you
I'll fuck your navel

1492
01:31:21,375 --> 01:31:25,368
Real thugs pop guns
You steal cable

1493
01:31:32,487 --> 01:31:36,355
I got more bush than High Times
More rhymes than LeAnn

1494
01:31:36,457 --> 01:31:38,391
Pull out my glock
Now you pee in your pants

1495
01:31:38,493 --> 01:31:41,985
It's your last chance, I'll cut your retinas
It's your last glance

1496
01:31:42,096 --> 01:31:43,825
Yo, bitch,
you're fucking worthless

1497
01:31:43,931 --> 01:31:46,695
And if you backstab me
I'll show you what a hearse is

1498
01:31:46,801 --> 01:31:48,996
You can't be fixed
by a hundred surgeons

1499
01:31:49,103 --> 01:31:51,765
I'll pull out my heater
and boom, bye-bye

1500
01:31:51,873 --> 01:31:53,807
Even when you're dead
I'm bustin' nuts in your eye

1501
01:31:53,908 --> 01:31:56,001
Sin, sin, sin
I'll stick a dildo in

1502
01:31:56,110 --> 01:31:58,772
While I'm hidin' in
the Shenaniganz' garbage bin

1503
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:01,178
And with the other hand
I'll doodle on some napkins

1504
01:32:01,282 --> 01:32:03,978
Fuck you with a loaf of bread
and make you cheat on Atkin's

1505
01:32:05,620 --> 01:32:07,144
- Ah, yeah.
- Oh, motherfucker.

1506
01:32:07,255 --> 01:32:08,722
I work at Shenaniganz

1507
01:32:08,823 --> 01:32:10,984
Blow me 'cause I'm an OG

1508
01:32:11,092 --> 01:32:13,720
So get the fuck out my dome
before I split yours

1509
01:32:13,828 --> 01:32:16,592
I used to have spit wars
and now I split whores in two

1510
01:32:16,697 --> 01:32:18,824
I am the walrus
Koo-koo-ka-choo

1511
01:32:18,933 --> 01:32:21,197
- So back up, sonny
- We got mad honeys

1512
01:32:21,302 --> 01:32:23,702
- We make much money
- And don't you dare laugh

1513
01:32:23,804 --> 01:32:25,169
'Cause this shit ain't funny

1514
01:32:25,273 --> 01:32:27,503
Squeeze the trigger
Now your head's all bloody

1515
01:32:27,608 --> 01:32:30,236
- We got new rides
- Now we'll flip the switches

1516
01:32:30,344 --> 01:32:32,574
- No more dirty dishes
- I'll steal people's wishes

1517
01:32:32,680 --> 01:32:33,942
And clock mad digits

1518
01:32:34,048 --> 01:32:36,243
Pump on a blot
and have sex with hot midgets

1519
01:32:36,350 --> 01:32:38,716
I love when your cunt
is balder than Bruce Willis

1520
01:32:38,819 --> 01:32:42,084
Nick and T-dog, motherfucker
We the illest

1521
01:32:42,189 --> 01:32:44,282
Peace out,
bitch-ass motherfuckers.

1522
01:32:44,392 --> 01:32:46,724
Get the fuck out
of my fuckin' face.

1523
01:32:46,827 --> 01:32:50,422
- Get the fuck out of my fuckin' face.
- Bitch-ass motherfuckers.

1524
01:33:30,905 --> 01:33:32,463
Oh, yeah!
