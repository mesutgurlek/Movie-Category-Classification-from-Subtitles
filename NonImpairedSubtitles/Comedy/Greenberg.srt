always with the self-hatred.

315
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:07,524
You're sweating.
I am. Yeah.

316
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,430
Have you been to
one of Eric's seders?

317
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:11,628
Eric gave trees to Israel.

318
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,495
Am I not allowed
to joke about it?

319
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:15,802
No, I know. I'm just saying,
since you said "less Jewish-Iooking,"

320
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:17,364
because most people
think I look Italian.

321
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,875
And since my mom was
actually Protestant,

322
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,105
I'm not actually
Jewish at all, so...

323
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,008
Good to see you.

324
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,316
What are you
doing these days?

325
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:30,014
You're in New York, right?
Yeah.

326
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:31,316
Making music?

327
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,085
Haven't played
music in years.

328
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:35,092
I'm a carpenter,
you know, for money.

329
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:39,290
But right now,
I'm really trying to do nothing for a while.

330
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,024
That's brave at our age.

331

a drink or something?

333
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,131

Oh...

358
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:09,611
Do you mind if we stop by my house?
I left my purse. Sorry.

359
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:12,641
Do you need it?

360
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,578
I still get carded.

361
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,622
I don't read enough.

362
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:23,795
I'm such a bad reader.

363
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:26,558

00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,326
Yeah, it's one
of the rare times

365
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,425
I was actually
happy around my dad.

00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:34,972
Did you do that?

367
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,735
No, that's my niece.

It's good.

369

She's four.

370
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,135
I want to have
a relationship with her,

371
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:44,478
she's just not
that friendly with me.

372
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:49,218
You want to see?
I got her these puppets for her birthday.

00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:54,053
They might be too old.
They have sticks.

Yeah. I'm sure
they'll be fine.

Oh.

378
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:05,866
Okay, you don't
want to go to the bar?

379
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:07,336
It's Friday.
The bars are probably

380
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:09,168
full of bridge
and tunnel people.

381
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,574
Or whatever the LA version
of bridge and tunnel is.

382
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:12,940
Sorry.

383
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,317
I don't really have...

384
00:25:20,418 --> 00:25:25,219
There's a Corona Light and some
cheap tequila someone left here once.

385
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:29,284
Shall we split
the Corona?

386
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,521
Okay.

(HICCUPS)

388
00:25:57,122 --> 00:25:59,590
I get the hiccups when I first drink carbonation.

389
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:01,523
Don't worry about it.

390
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:31,053
I'm wearing kind
of an ugly bra.

391
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:34,322
It's like an ACE bandage.
There's no clasp.

392
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,780
Do you hear a train?

393
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:00,478
Is that a train?

394
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:05,455
I get kind of nerdy.

395
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:09,856
Don't worry about it.

396
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:16,061
Can we take it slow?

397
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:18,125
I'm sorry,
it's just that...

398
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:20,000
I just got out of
a long relationship,

399
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:22,301
and I don't want to
go from just having sex

400
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:24,569
to just having sex
to just having sex.

401
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:28,743
Who's the third
"just having sex"?

402
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:31,807
You, if we had sex.

403
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:35,816
Okay,
then who's the second?

404
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:38,412
A guy I met at
this gallery thing.

405
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:42,454
You slept with him?

406
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:44,561
Yeah, I did.

407
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:47,224
How did that go?

408
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,032
What do you mean?
The sex?

409
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:51,568
Yeah. Well...

410
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:55,206
It was pretty awkward.

411
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,610
What is that
on your lip?

412
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:09,745
What?

413
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:12,418
Is that a...
Nothing.

414
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:14,990
No, it's not a cold sore.
You sure?

415
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,755
Yeah, I picked it.

416
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:19,796
Where's your bathroom?

417
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:45,578
This is so annoying,
but I have to call my friend, Gina, back.

418
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:49,354
Sorry, it's just, if I don't call her back,
then I'll be a bad friend.

419
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:51,952
She's always got an emergency.
I'm sure it's nothing.

420
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,157
Uh, how far do you think
it would be to walk?

421
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:56,531
To your brother's?

422
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:59,593
Way too long, like five miles.
You can stay here.

423
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:01,571
I have the dog and...

424
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:05,333
I can drive you.
This will only take a second.

425
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:07,838
You have to call
her right this moment?

426
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,779
Won't she understand
you're in the middle of a...

427
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:13,682
No, no.
I'll take you now. Sorry.

428
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,982
You know, I... You don't have to do that.
You've got your robe...

429
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:17,612
Oh, no.
It's not a problem.

430
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:19,054
I can probably call a cab.

431
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:20,284
Okay.

432
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:24,322
This is stupid.

I'm singing this Saturday at this
place on Orange and Sunset.

434

I mean, if you feel like it.
I know it's last minute.

435
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:35,732
Oh, my friend Gina
made the flyers

436
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:37,775
and she wrote down
the address wrong.

437
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:40,272
I don't think...
What time?

438
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:41,505
Like 11:30.

439
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:44,139
There's a lot of acts,
so it's kind of hard to pinpoint.

440
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:46,115
Don't feel obligated.

441
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,345
We probably shouldn't
do this again.

442
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:52,187
I mean,
you work for my brother. Yeah.

443
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:54,384
And I'm really trying to
do nothing right now.

444
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:55,687
That's cool.

445
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,923

just 'cause they feel good.

787
00:47:46,463 --> 00:47:47,691
I'm impressed by you.

788
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:49,958
In what way?

789
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:51,159
I don't know.

790
00:47:51,235 --> 00:47:53,567
I mean, you seem
really fine doing nothing.

791
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:57,971
It's like you don't feel all that
bullshit pressure to be successful.

792
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:02,107
I mean,
by other people's standards.

793
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:04,035
I'm...

794
00:48:05,415 --> 00:48:07,906
You know, I almost had a record
deal when I got out of college.

795
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:09,478
I haven't done nothing.

796
00:48:10,087 --> 00:48:11,145
Cool.

797
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:12,950
I want to be
doing nothing.

798
00:48:13,023 --> 00:48:14,615
I'm doing
nothing deliberately.

799
00:48:14,691 --> 00:48:16,090
That's what I'm saying.

800
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:18,525
I don't know that
I could do nothing

801
00:48:18,595 --> 00:48:20,324
and be that cool
with everything.

802
00:48:22,165 --> 00:48:23,860
Well, there's so
much crap out there.

803
00:48:26,303 --> 00:48:27,531
Mahler's not at home.

804
00:48:30,107 --> 00:48:31,870
You could stay over.

805
00:48:32,676 --> 00:48:33,836
Wink-wink.

806
00:48:35,846 --> 00:48:36,835
Um...

807
00:48:37,714 --> 00:48:38,908
I'm not supposed to...

808
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,376
I try not to...

809
00:48:43,887 --> 00:48:46,014
But, fuck it.
Yeah, okay.

810
00:48:54,531 --> 00:48:55,793
Ivan's nice.

811
00:48:57,834 --> 00:48:59,665
Is he your best friend?

812
00:49:00,737 --> 00:49:02,068
Yeah, I guess so.

813
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:06,500
I lost Ivan
there for a few years

814
00:49:06,576 --> 00:49:09,602
to this racist
he met in rehab.

815
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:13,947
But their marriage is ending,
which is good for him,

816
00:49:15,052 --> 00:49:17,077
and me, to be honest.

817
00:49:17,154 --> 00:49:18,143
Good.

818
00:49:18,221 --> 00:49:19,245
You probably
wouldn't believe this,

819
00:49:19,323 --> 00:49:20,881
but in college we
all looked up to him.

820
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:23,354
He was from England

821
00:49:23,427 --> 00:49:26,328
and he used to be
really handsome and stylish

822
00:49:26,396 --> 00:49:28,455
and kind of great.
I can believe that.

823
00:49:28,532 --> 00:49:30,898
Ivan and I call each other "man,"
but it's meant as a joke.

824
00:49:31,702 --> 00:49:33,727
It's the kind of thing
we wouldn't say, 'cause...

825
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,271
It's our imitation
of other people.

826
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:37,968
I know what that's like.

827
00:49:38,041 --> 00:49:40,066
This friend of mine,
Marnie, and me,

828
00:49:41,011 --> 00:49:42,000
we went...

829
00:49:44,614 --> 00:49:48,778
We went to this
cheesy bar in Hollywood

830
00:49:50,253 --> 00:49:51,811
and we just thought,

831
00:49:51,888 --> 00:49:53,879
"Let's pretend to
be these slutty girls

832
00:49:53,957 --> 00:49:55,424
"who are looking
to get picked up,

833
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:56,891
"even though we're not."

834
00:49:57,761 --> 00:50:00,958
And we end up talking to these two frat guys,

835
00:50:01,031 --> 00:50:02,760
but, like, 30.

836
00:50:03,233 --> 00:50:05,758
And they were all
into their bodies

837
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:08,896
and cologned,
very well-groomed.

838
00:50:08,972 --> 00:50:14,103
And we ended up going back
to one of their places.

839
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:19,406
And I think one of them was, like,
almost retarded,

840
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:22,008
or else he was really drunk,

841
00:50:22,085 --> 00:50:23,450
because he
didn't make any sense.

842
00:50:24,488 --> 00:50:26,786
And they got out
this video camera

843
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:31,252
and Marnie and I,
we did this kind of striptease.

844
00:50:31,328 --> 00:50:33,853
And it was crazy

845
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:37,422
because we were still
playing these girls,

846
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:40,902
but there we were,
showing our breasts...

847
00:50:43,473 --> 00:50:45,407
And then,

848
00:50:45,475 --> 00:50:48,808
we ran out of there pretty fast.
We were total freaks.

849
00:50:57,654 --> 00:50:59,212
You never have
anything good to drink.

850
00:51:03,326 --> 00:51:05,453
You know,
that's like the stupidest story I've ever heard.

851
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:07,658
It's just...

852
00:51:08,331 --> 00:51:09,320
Bye.

853
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:11,961
What?
What is the point of that story?

he's an asshole.

860

That's a defense.

861
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:41,659
He's not like us.
He's...

862
00:51:41,731 --> 00:51:45,633
You can tell that a lot of normal
stuff is really hard for him.

863
00:51:45,702 --> 00:51:46,999
Like being nice?

864
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:48,332
I like him.

865
00:51:48,405 --> 00:51:50,270
Should I call him?
No!

866
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:51,432
I don't like
how he treats you.

867
00:51:51,508 --> 00:51:52,839
He acts like
you work for him.

868
00:51:52,909 --> 00:51:54,342
Well, I work
for his brother.

869
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:56,336
I don't wanna be rude.

870
00:51:56,413 --> 00:51:59,678
If you keep driving him places,
I'll stop speaking to you.

871
00:52:01,218 --> 00:52:02,310
Okay.

872
00:52:02,986 --> 00:52:06,217

Uh-huh.

This hospital,
it has more experience with internal medicine.

I called,
and they're expecting you.

875

You can't do it here?

876
00:52:15,665 --> 00:52:17,633
I mean, you know him now.

877
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:20,067
I know,
but he needs to get well.

878

Thank you. Come on, Mahler.
I know the doctors there.

You'll be in good hands.

I'm trying
not to call her.

884
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:34,307
I'm just going to
hurt her feelings, man.

885
00:52:34,384 --> 00:52:36,511
I'm trying not to do
that to people anymore.

886
00:52:36,586 --> 00:52:39,316
And I don't want to be asking
anyone for a ride anymore, ever.

about that night

after we played

910

and you were there
with your sister,

go to that party

and you were tired
and I let you go home.

914
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:52,092
You were with your sister.

Yeah, I don't...
I don't remember that night.

00:53:55,332 --> 00:53:56,526
I should have been
straight with you 'cause

917
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,000
I originally got into
music to meet girls,

918
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:00,969
and I think when we
were playing around LA

919
00:54:01,037 --> 00:54:02,299

get some attention...

for how I behaved,

of just let it end,

943
00:55:05,902 --> 00:55:08,496
Yeah.

944
00:55:08,571 --> 00:55:09,560

Beth,

946
00:55:12,042 --> 00:55:14,135
I made you that bed.
Don't you remember?

947
00:55:15,111 --> 00:55:17,102
It was why we were going to
buy the mattress to begin with.

948
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:22,208

00:55:24,387 --> 00:55:26,548
I work out of
a studio in Bushwick

951
00:55:26,623 --> 00:55:28,648
that I share with a few
other carpenters and that's

952
00:55:30,093 --> 00:55:31,219
been pretty good.

What else?

956
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:38,296
Recently,
I had this thing

957
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:40,833
where I
couldn't move my legs,

958

literally.

959
00:55:42,806 --> 00:55:44,273
You know,
but it was psychological.

960
00:55:45,475 --> 00:55:46,737
God...

961
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:48,869
Yeah, so that took
some time dealing with.

962
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:51,979
I think that
brings us up to date.

964

Yeah.

965

I just... I think I need to just let go,
you know?

966

"You only miss by 5%."

968
00:56:07,997 --> 00:56:09,487
I'm not positive
what it means,

969
00:56:09,566 --> 00:56:11,932
but in most things,
95 is pretty good.

970
00:56:13,002 --> 00:56:15,562

once who told me,

971
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:20,098
"You're of value."

972
00:56:20,176 --> 00:56:23,475

but it always stayed with me.

980

No. No.

Thanks. Thank you.

1104

like, this homeless
junkie in the '70s.

1105

it's a woman with sandals.

you can sing on there.

You like old things.

1108

A shrink said to me once,

1109
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:33,466
I have trouble living in the present,
so I linger on the past

1110
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:36,505
because I felt like I never really
lived it in the first place, you know?

1111
01:04:39,075 --> 01:04:40,406
Do you think
you could love me?

1112
01:04:43,246 --> 01:04:44,907
I don't know, Florence.

1113
01:04:50,786 --> 01:04:52,879
I just get excited
to see you, and then...

1114
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:57,724
I think I get worried
it's gonna go too fast,

1115
01:04:57,793 --> 01:04:59,317
so I say things
to get a reaction.

1116
01:05:19,849 --> 01:05:21,248
What?

1117
01:05:21,317 --> 01:05:23,046
We got to stop this.

1118
01:05:23,686 --> 01:05:24,983
Really?
Yeah.

1119
01:05:25,054 --> 01:05:26,612
You got to stop calling me.

1120
01:05:26,689 --> 01:05:28,122
I've intentionally
not called you.

1121
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:31,284
Even when I needed to call you,
I didn't. You know, I took a pet taxi.

1122
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:32,827
I haven't called you.

1123

You called me today.

1124
01:05:35,498 --> 01:05:36,556
That was for Mahler.

1125
01:05:36,632 --> 01:05:38,964
Come on,
it wasn't for Mahler.

1126
01:05:39,035 --> 01:05:40,935
Florence,
take some responsibility.

1127
01:05:41,003 --> 01:05:42,800
Don't put yourself in
this kind of situation.

1128
01:05:43,372 --> 01:05:45,431
What situation?
I like seeing you.

1129
01:05:45,508 --> 01:05:47,339
No, you don't.
You don't like it.

1130
01:05:48,144 --> 01:05:51,136
Why are we even having this conversation?
We're not really even dating,

1131
01:05:51,714 --> 01:05:53,579
and we're
seeing other people.

1132
01:05:53,649 --> 01:05:54,673
I'm not seeing anyone.

1133
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:56,547
Neither am I,
but I want to.

I don't know! Anyone.

I'm not tied to anyone.

How many times do we have to go over it?
Jesus, I...

1137

I should be with a divorced
38-year-old who has teenage kids

1138
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:09,591
and low expectations
about life.

1139

fucking do this anymore.

They're for the blood clots.

1144
01:07:42,758 --> 01:07:45,249

to one-and-a-half a day

ROGER: Is that coke?

1405
01:21:24,779 --> 01:21:25,905
Yup.

1406
01:21:25,981 --> 01:21:27,608

Is it okay to mix
coke and Zoloft?

1411
01:21:42,030 --> 01:21:45,488
Yeah, totally.
I haven't done this in, like, 15 years.

1412
01:21:46,134 --> 01:21:50,366
Since college, or since a couple of years out.
It's very unlike me.

1413
01:21:54,876 --> 01:21:56,707
I actually hate coke.

1414

I hate it politically and I
hate how it makes me feel.

1415
01:21:59,614 --> 01:22:00,911
But when it's done,
I may have to

1416

kill one of you out
of sheer frustration.

I did coke was with you.

01:28:48,189 --> 01:28:50,817
I wanted to make
that record.

1559
01:28:50,892 --> 01:28:53,793
We never would've survived at a
major label with those restrictions.

1560
01:28:53,861 --> 01:28:54,850
How the fuck do you know?

1561
01:28:54,929 --> 01:28:56,294
Because that's not
how the world works.

1562
01:28:56,364 --> 01:28:59,492
What could you possibly know
about how the world works?

1563
01:28:59,567 --> 01:29:00,932
Listen, man,
I think you're playing out

1564
01:29:01,002 --> 01:29:02,264
some old family
dynamic here...

1565
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:03,895
Apropos of what we
were saying before

1566
01:29:03,971 --> 01:29:05,461
about what
people say about us?

1567
01:29:05,540 --> 01:29:07,303
People feel you hold on
to petty resentments.

1568
01:29:07,375 --> 01:29:09,605
You asked me what
people say about you.

1569
01:29:09,677 --> 01:29:11,542
I don't want to know.
Yeah, well, you should know.

1570
01:29:11,612 --> 01:29:13,170
People think you
play the victim.

1571
01:29:13,247 --> 01:29:14,680
And I don't mean
this in a bad way,

1572
01:29:14,749 --> 01:29:16,114
but you let people
feel sorry for you

1573
01:29:16,184 --> 01:29:17,742
when you're really just
protecting your own narcissism.

1574
01:29:17,819 --> 01:29:18,808
I don't want to know!

1575
01:29:18,886 --> 01:29:21,821
Well, that's why I didn't want to
be in a fucking band with you!

1576
01:29:21,889 --> 01:29:24,949
Because you won't
acknowledge your own shit.

1577
01:29:26,127 --> 01:29:28,652
And you were
fucked up all the time!

1578
01:29:30,398 --> 01:29:32,923
What do you want me to say, huh?
What do you want me to say?

1579
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,867
I had no idea that
would be our only offer.

1580
01:29:36,537 --> 01:29:38,198
I didn't think that
I had the power to blow it.

1581
01:29:38,272 --> 01:29:41,503
I thought that we were all
just giving our two cents.

1582
01:29:41,576 --> 01:29:44,170
Fuck, I didn't know
I was gonna be

1583
01:29:44,245 --> 01:29:46,873
the one to make
the band fall apart.

1584
01:29:46,948 --> 01:29:50,384
You know, maybe, obviously,
I would do it differently now!

1585
01:29:54,155 --> 01:29:56,851
Of course I know what it's like
to live a life I didn't plan on.

1586
01:29:56,924 --> 01:30:00,155
What the fuck do you think I'm doing right now?

1587
01:30:08,202 --> 01:30:11,399
Florence told me
you were in the hospital.

1588
01:30:13,708 --> 01:30:16,438
I'd know,
I understand about those things.

1589
01:30:16,511 --> 01:30:18,479
You know,
we could've talked about it,

1590
01:30:18,546 --> 01:30:19,911
maybe made each
other feel better,

1591
01:30:19,981 --> 01:30:23,417
but instead we never talk
about anything good.

1592
01:30:31,692 --> 01:30:34,160
This is a small thing,

1593
01:30:34,228 --> 01:30:36,822
and it's probably
boring for you,

1594
01:30:36,898 --> 01:30:39,867
but it would've been nice if you'd
have made an effort to know Vic.

1595
01:30:39,934 --> 01:30:40,992
Who's Vic?

1596
01:30:41,068 --> 01:30:42,057
My son.

1597
01:30:42,136 --> 01:30:45,299
Oh, Victor. I didn't
recognize the diminutive.

1598
01:31:09,530 --> 01:31:11,691
(ON ANSWERING MACHINE) <i>Hi,
it's Florence. Leave a message.</i>

1599
01:31:11,766 --> 01:31:12,960
Florence.

1600
01:31:13,568 --> 01:31:16,332
Florence, I'm calling
to say I'm sorry

1601
01:31:16,404 --> 01:31:18,668
you had to go through
what you're going through.

1602
01:31:18,739 --> 01:31:22,698
And Mahler's fine.
He ate pizza.

1603
01:31:24,779 --> 01:31:28,044
I'm leaving this in your voicemail,
but it's really a letter.

1604
01:31:28,115 --> 01:31:31,175
I get so angry about
the world, you know?

1605
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:33,646
If I knew who
to write a letter to

1606
01:31:33,721 --> 01:31:36,417
about all the stupidity
in the world, I'd do it.

1607
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:43,153
You're 25.
I was just 27.

1608
01:31:44,599 --> 01:31:48,000
You're brave.
Young people are brave.

1609
01:31:49,504 --> 01:31:51,768
When I was a kid,
I was a leader

1610
01:31:51,839 --> 01:31:54,069
and most of the kids
always looked up to me.

1611
01:31:55,643 --> 01:31:58,544
I thought I might go into space,
you know, as an astronaut.

1612
01:31:58,713 --> 01:32:01,739
(CHUCKLES) I can't even
swim in the fucking pool.

1613
01:32:01,816 --> 01:32:03,681
My brother's in Vietnam.

1614
01:32:03,751 --> 01:32:06,242
We have the same parents.
I can't blame that.

1615
01:32:10,258 --> 01:32:13,921
I really love Phillip,
but I'm not supposed to be on his bed.

1616
01:32:16,063 --> 01:32:19,260
I love my parents.
I love Mahler.

1617
01:32:20,835 --> 01:32:22,302
I miss my mom.

1618
01:32:23,538 --> 01:32:27,099
I really like you.

1619
01:32:28,242 --> 01:32:32,178
I just hate how embarrassing it all is.
I don't understand.

1620
01:32:32,446 --> 01:32:33,811
What happened to me?

1621
01:32:34,448 --> 01:32:36,348
Where does experience go?

1622
01:32:37,318 --> 01:32:40,879
Remember Charlie Sheen standing
on his balcony in <i>Wall Street?</i>

1623
01:32:40,955 --> 01:32:43,788
Did you see that movie?
Saying, "Who am I?"

1624
01:32:44,825 --> 01:32:46,918
Phillip and I used to
make so much fun of it.

1625
01:32:46,994 --> 01:32:49,087
I'm thinking, now,
it wasn't so stupid.

1626
01:32:50,097 --> 01:32:54,830
Somebody once said to me,
"Hurt people hurt people."

1627
01:32:56,737 --> 01:32:59,331
It's kind of trite,
but it stayed with me.

1628
01:32:59,407 --> 01:33:03,901
Oh, man! That was you,
like, a few days ago.

1629
01:33:03,978 --> 01:33:06,538
I used to have
a really good memory, too.

1630
01:33:06,614 --> 01:33:10,175
Anyway, we do...
I do hurt people.

1631
01:33:11,619 --> 01:33:14,281
Hurt people.

1632
01:33:16,524 --> 01:33:18,788
I think Ivan and I broke up.

1633
01:33:24,332 --> 01:33:29,031
Florence, I really like you.

1634
01:33:30,471 --> 01:33:32,063
Love, Roger.

Holy shit!

1642
01:34:14,348 --> 01:34:15,872
How you feeling, Sunny?

1643
01:34:16,017 --> 01:34:17,575
What's "Sunny"?

1644
01:34:18,219 --> 01:34:20,687
We decided that's
our name for you.

1645
01:34:21,188 --> 01:34:22,951
I think I'm still drunk.

1646
01:34:29,864 --> 01:34:33,129
Hey, they printed my
letter about Pakistan.

1647

I've got no problem giving some guy a blowjob,

1650

it to the extreme.

MURIEL: Why do guys like to do that?
Come on you and spread it?

They don't all like it.
(LAUGHS) They do.

1653

You have dogs?

No, Florence showed me
how to do it.

1657
01:35:04,865 --> 01:35:07,891
Did you start an affair
with Phillip's assistant?

No.

There's a great Kinks song called <i>Australia.</i>

is fucking Lily.

about it now,

and it's so much worse
than I remembered.

maybe I was drunk at the time.

Sunny will look at whales.

1710
01:37:28,576 --> 01:37:31,977
Okay, you know what?
You can cut out the Sunny business.

1711
01:37:32,046 --> 01:37:33,206
(MURIEL COUGHING)

1712
01:37:33,681 --> 01:37:36,912
SARA: Oh, my God,
look at this guy in these overalls and the clogs.

1713
01:37:36,984 --> 01:37:38,246
I left my ChapStick.
Oh, my God.

1714
01:37:38,319 --> 01:37:40,412
Are overalls back in now,
or is he crazy?

1715
01:37:40,487 --> 01:37:43,456
No, I saw a bunch of
people in overalls...

1716
01:37:54,902 --> 01:37:56,301
MURIEL: Hey,
will you check this out?

1717
01:37:56,370 --> 01:37:57,701
SARA: What the fuck
is that?

1718
01:37:57,771 --> 01:37:58,829
That is so weird.

1719
01:37:58,906 --> 01:38:01,136
I know, right? It's so itchy.
Don't touch it. Don't touch it.

1720
01:38:01,208 --> 01:38:05,110
You know what?
I'm supposed to get someone from the hospital.

1721
01:38:05,179 --> 01:38:06,976
No, no, no.
Hold it. Hey! Hey, hold it!

1722
01:38:07,047 --> 01:38:08,912
Can you open my door?
No, you're our prisoner.

1723
01:38:08,983 --> 01:38:11,383
Exactly. Come on,
open the fucking door, please.

1724
01:38:11,452 --> 01:38:12,749
Okay, fine.
Come on.

1725
01:38:12,820 --> 01:38:14,720
Roger, it's a rental.
Open it.

1726
01:38:14,788 --> 01:38:16,415
Would you stop?
Sara, open the fucking door!

1727
01:38:16,490 --> 01:38:18,458
I'm trying.
Stop pulling on it!

1728
01:38:18,893 --> 01:38:20,724
You know, I can't go,
I can't afford it

1729
01:38:20,794 --> 01:38:23,888
(STAMMERING) and I have to
pick up my friend.

1730
01:38:24,531 --> 01:38:25,828
Have a good time,
all right?

1731
01:38:28,636 --> 01:38:29,762
MURIEL: Bye!

1732
01:39:12,012 --> 01:39:16,472
I've got to get insurance.
The anesthesia's so expensive.

1733
01:39:16,550 --> 01:39:18,848
I'm such a baby
about pain.

1734
01:39:21,155 --> 01:39:23,055
And I stayed overnight.

1735
01:39:24,491 --> 01:39:27,085
I'm glad your brother's
coming back next week.

1736
01:39:27,161 --> 01:39:29,152
I need to work more hours.

1737
01:39:37,304 --> 01:39:38,532
Thanks.

1738
01:39:43,143 --> 01:39:45,441
I really picked
my lip in my sleep,

1739
01:39:46,046 --> 01:39:48,913
which was possibly about
finding a pet in the Canyons.

1740
01:39:50,351 --> 01:39:51,511
Do you, uh,

1741
01:39:53,620 --> 01:39:54,848
get <i>The New York Times?</i>

1742
01:39:54,922 --> 01:39:56,082
No.

1743
01:39:57,024 --> 01:39:59,857
It's good to get the paper.
I'll pick you up one.

1744
01:39:59,927 --> 01:40:01,121
Okay.

1745
01:40:03,097 --> 01:40:05,031
Did you get my message?

1746
01:40:05,099 --> 01:40:07,897
I haven't checked yet.
What did you say?

1747
01:40:08,602 --> 01:40:09,591
Um...

1748
01:40:10,437 --> 01:40:13,895
I reassessed the movie <i>Wall Street,</i>
among other things.

1749
01:40:15,109 --> 01:40:16,667
I don't know it.

1750
01:40:20,280 --> 01:40:24,546
I wasn't gonna give it to you 'cause I was pissed,
but you can open it.

1751
01:40:24,618 --> 01:40:26,449
Happy birthday, again.

1752
01:40:27,654 --> 01:40:28,746
Thanks.

1753
01:40:32,092 --> 01:40:35,721
Now you have the set.
Not that they're a set.

1754
01:40:37,998 --> 01:40:39,863
What about your niece?

1755
01:40:39,933 --> 01:40:42,595
Remember,
the sticks are too old.

1756
01:40:42,669 --> 01:40:45,866
She's coming over this weekend.
I framed her picture.

1757
01:40:53,847 --> 01:40:55,474
Do you have
a tape-measure?

1758
01:40:55,549 --> 01:40:58,074
I think there's a ruler
in the desk drawer.

1759
01:41:06,660 --> 01:41:08,218
Do you have a hammer?

1760
01:41:08,295 --> 01:41:09,819
Maybe in there.

1761
01:41:10,898 --> 01:41:11,922
Here?

1762
01:41:13,300 --> 01:41:14,995
You want it on
this wall, here?

1763
01:41:16,670 --> 01:41:17,762
Okay.

1764
01:41:23,110 --> 01:41:24,236
Cool.

1765
01:41:25,379 --> 01:41:27,074
Like a professional.

1766
01:41:27,781 --> 01:41:29,806
Well, I am a professional.

1767
01:41:31,518 --> 01:41:33,383
I mean, I build things.

1768
01:41:42,463 --> 01:41:46,092
I know you know I was in a hospital.
I'm not hiding it.

1769
01:41:50,003 --> 01:41:52,437
But it's not what
defines me, you know?

1770
01:41:54,141 --> 01:41:55,608
I understand.
(HAMMERING)

1771
01:42:08,789 --> 01:42:10,950
I want to
listen to my message.

1772
01:42:15,729 --> 01:42:19,495
I'd had some to drink.

1773
01:42:33,747 --> 01:42:35,078
Gina.

1774
01:42:41,355 --> 01:42:42,720
My mom.

1775
01:42:48,896 --> 01:42:51,831
Okay. This is you.

1776
01:43:03,143 --> 01:43:05,634
