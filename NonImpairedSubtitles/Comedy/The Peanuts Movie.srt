I could complete the book
report for the two of us.

Yeah, leave him alone!

Now, Charlie Brown, as far
as the book report goes,

Well, you can never go wrong
if you stick with the classics.

had to have hard covers.

You remembered my name?

Of course I did.

Before you leave, there's something
I really need to know.

01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:59,740
Why, out of all the kids in our class,

1156
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:02,081
would you want to be partners with me?

That's easy.

1158
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:07,684
Because I've seen
the type of person you are.

That's not who you are at all.

1161
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:18,770
I like the compassion you showed
for your sister at the talent show.

1162
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:21,442
The honesty you had at the assembly.

you were brave, and funny.
