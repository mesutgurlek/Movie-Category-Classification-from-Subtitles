1
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,716
Okay, what we're
getting now is, yes,

2
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,260
they're saying it was, in
fact, a fire that erupted

3
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,262
inside the external tank
of the ship

4
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:57,348
exactly 98 seconds after it
entered the asteroid field.

5
00:00:57,433 --> 00:00:59,100
No one is sure
what caused the fire

6
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:00,810
which led to
the massive explosion

7
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,979
killing all 12
crew members and scientists

8
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,897
aboard the space
shuttle Deliverance,

9
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:07,608
taking with them our
last and only hope.

10
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:09,402
Once again,
if you're just tuning in,

11
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,195
the CSA space shuttle
Deliverance

12
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,321
has been destroyed.

13
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:15,241
The final mission to
save mankind has failed.

14
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:18,494
The 70-mile-wide asteroid
known commonly as "Matilda"

15
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:21,831
is set to collide with Earth
in exactly three weeks' time,

16
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,916
and we'll be bringing you
up-to-the-minute coverage

17
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:26,127
of our countdown
to the end of days,

18
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:29,046
along with all your
classic rock favorites.

19
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:30,798
This is Q107.2.

20
00:01:34,303 --> 00:01:36,429
I think we missed the exit.

21
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:16,511
They say the damage
to the tower has rendered

22
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:19,222
all cellular
telephones useless.

23
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:21,432
No word yet on how long
before water and power

24
00:02:21,517 --> 00:02:22,850
will be shut off altogether.

25
00:02:22,935 --> 00:02:24,977
But we'll be bringing you
all the information you need

26
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:26,562
just as long as
we have a live feed.

27
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:29,649
And be sure to stay tuned at
9:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time

28
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,234
for the End of the World
Awareness Concert.

29
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:34,821
The human migration
continues...

30
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:41,911
- Sorry, dude!
- It's okay.

31
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,169
What are you doing?

32
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:51,921
Hey, up yours, pal!

33
00:03:16,746 --> 00:03:17,363
I'm sorry, sir,

34
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,948
that's not covered
under your current policy.

35
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:24,245
I'm afraid the Armageddon
package is extra, yes.

36
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,874
Well, that protects you
and your family

37
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,418
against any sort of
apocalyptic disaster.

38
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:33,838
Asteroids, obviously,
plague, famine, locusts...

39
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,050
Drawbacks?

40
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:40,553
The premiums are high...

41
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,475
I'm sorry... Can you just hold
on for one moment? Thank you.

42
00:03:49,054 --> 00:03:50,938
So feel free to wear

43
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:55,651
your casual Friday clothing
pretty much any day of the week.

44
00:03:56,486 --> 00:04:00,990
And since Ted in Human
Resources is no longer with us,

45
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:09,332
I thought I'd let you all know of
a few positions in upper management

46
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,834
that have been made available.

47
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:17,590
So, if anyone wants to be
Chief Financial Officer...

48
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:20,843
CFO? Anyone?

49
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:23,971
Life has no meaning.

50
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:25,181
Anyone?

51
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,808
I really think I'm coming
down with something.

52
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:30,728
On your right!

53
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:33,606
On your right, buddy.

54
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,732
On your right!

55
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,057
You could have
told me that yesterday!

56
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:21,946
Linda?

57
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,074
Oh, hi, Elsa.

58
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:27,284
Hi, Mr. Dodge.

59
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,829
- Okay, I finish.
- Okay.

60
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,292
Me estoy volviendo vieja,
Mr. Dodge. I getting older.

61
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:38,254
I didn't mean to rush
you off or anything.

62
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,510
Do you have someplace to be?

63
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,597
I mean, if you want,
you could...

64
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,600
I don't know,
you could watch TV here,

65
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,146
or something,
whatever you like.

66
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,356
Oh, my kids are waiting.

67
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:59,608
Oh, right. Of course.
You have kids.

68
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,946
Listen, Elsa, you don't
have to come next week.

69
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:09,285
Or, you know, ever, if you
don't want to. It's okay.

70
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:11,537
You firing me?

71
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,372
No, no, no. No, I just...

72
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,041
Is this because
I don't watch TV with you?

73
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:18,044
No. No. I...

74
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,546
I just thought, considering...

75
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:27,178
There's just no need to...

76
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,185
Nothing. Forget it. It's fine.

77
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:38,314
You're out of Windose.

78
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:40,524
More Windose, got it.

79
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:43,652
See you next week, Mr. Dodge.

80
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,945
Okay.

81
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,739
I regret my entire life.

82
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,032
- Okay.
- Okay.

83
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,408
- Bye!
- Bye, now.

84
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:51,410
Well, it's no longer
just the postal service.

85
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:55,623
Commercial airlines have
discontinued altogether today.

86
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:58,501
After much delay, the final
flight, piloted by Delta Airlines,

87
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:01,253
left Chicago Midway
at 3:45 Central Time,

88
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:03,422
touching down in
Seattle at 6:15 Pacific.

89
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:05,633
Private charters have been
given military clearance

90
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:08,677
to use intercontinental
airspace at their own risk.

91
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:11,722
And now
the traffic report. Amy?

92
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,933
We're fucked, Bob.

93
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,393
Thank you, Amy.

94
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:24,735
Oh, shit.

95
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:49,844
They have yet to make
a statement regarding rumors

96
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:52,847
of a classified space launch for
high-ranking government officials,

97
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:55,015
religious figureheads,
and important contributors

98
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,393
to athletics and entertainment.

99
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:00,354
They have predicted
the exact location of impact,

100
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:03,524
but the government is refusing to
release this information to the public

101
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:06,318
to avoid creating an even
greater sense of panic.

102
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,760
- Oh! You're early!
- Hi.

103
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:34,180
Warren told me about Linda.

104
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:35,264
Oh, yeah...

105
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,933
I am so surprised
she didn't do it sooner.

106
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:40,936
She never really looked happy,

107
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,605
especially when
she was with you.

108
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,565
That's new information.

109
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,066
Really?

110
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:47,735
Why do you think she
didn't want to have kids?

111
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:50,696
Karen Amalfi is
coming alone tonight.

112
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,239
Don't. Do not.

113
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:53,824
Do not what?

114
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:57,536
Please, Warren. Can we just
have a few sober moments tonight?

115
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,874
This is the Last Supper, Diane.

116
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,710
You think Jesus was sober
for his last supper?

117
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,545
You think he turned
water into lemonade?

118
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:09,048
Dodge, a little help, please.

119
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:11,383
No, no, no, no, no.
Dodge is my friend.

120
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:13,844
My friend.
Look at this, my friend.

121
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,473
This is a Don Ramon cigar.

122
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,226
This is the hardest
cigar in the world...

123
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,312
Can you chop those
a little louder, please?

124
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,941
This is the hardest cigar
in the world to find.

125
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:30,194
And tonight, I'm going to share
one of my last 13 with you.

126
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,529
How's that sit?

127
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,242
Hi, Danny.

128
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:38,077
Hey, can I fix you
a drink, son?

129
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,204
Quit ruining my life.

130
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:43,332
Good for you, sweetie. Express yourself.

131
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,500
Go fuck yourself!

132
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:46,502
I was thinking
maybe we should set up

133
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,462
Dodge with Karen.
Don't you think?

134
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,006
Oh, my God, will you stop it?

135
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:52,675
What?

136
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,594
He doesn't want to get set up
with one of your gross friends.

137
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,137
He needs to meet somebody!

138
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:58,347
No, he doesn't!

139
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,140
- Leave him alone.
- He is alone, look at him.

140
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:01,934
- I'm fine.
- No, honey, you're not fine.

141
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,353
You're gonna die alone.
Doesn't that bother you?

142
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,105
- He's not gonna die alone.
- Yes, he is.

143
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:09,316
He's not gonna die alone.
He's gonna die with everybody else!

144
00:10:09,801 --> 00:10:11,860
There's just no need
to cling to who's closest.

145
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,530
This isn't
the fucking Ark, Diane.

146
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:17,616
This is the Titanic!

147
00:10:19,209 --> 00:10:22,496
And there is not
a life raft in sight.

148
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:27,876
Welcome aboard.

149
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,172
Dodge, you remember
Karen Amalfi.

150
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:33,257
Hello, good to see you.

151
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:34,717
Hi.

152
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,226
It's everything I never wore.

153
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,649
It's very nice, very shiny.

154
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:55,821
You're funny.

155
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,327
So...

156
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,125
Well...

157
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:13,839
We decided that we would use
this time to be with family.

158
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:17,009
First we're gonna go to
West Virginia, see my sister

159
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:20,179
and her husband
and the two boys.

160
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:22,514
Even though we just saw them.

161
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,308
We just saw them.

162
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:29,855
And then Lacey wants to go
to her stepfather's in Aspen

163
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,608
so that she can
tell him to fuck off.

164
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:34,985
And also ski!

165
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:36,653
And ski.

166
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:38,447
- Great!
- Yeah.

167
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,240
Karen?

168
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:49,208
Okay, well, I think I'm finally
gonna take that pottery class.

169
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:52,711
And... Well, I'm gonna
eat whatever I want,

170
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:55,631
and totally
not even care. Just...

171
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,300
Go, girl.

172
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:01,637
And maybe I'll...

173
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,226
be spending a little time
with someone special.

174
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,149
Yeah.

175
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,568
Oh, me? Let's see...

176
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:19,738
What was the question?

177
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:27,162
Qué será, será!

178
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:31,250
We're gonna ski first,
and then she's gonna tell...

179
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:35,170
Drink! Drink!
Drink! Drink! Drink!

180
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:39,007
Fight through the burn, fight through
the burn! Fight through the burn!

181
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:55,665
Yes!

182
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,446
Winner's wine!

183
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,158
- Hey, Dodge!
- Hey, Roache.

184
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:08,745
Dodger! I'm gonna miss you, man.
Gonna miss you...

185
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:12,791
Oh, boy. It's the fucking
Wild West, you know?

186
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:14,209
- Is it?
- Come on.

187
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:18,714
Single guys like us, I mean, we
gotta grab this thing, you know?

188
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,884
Because it is
a different world now.

189
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,302
It's a different world.

190
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:25,137
- Okay.
- We gotta... You know?

191
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,722
No, I don't. I don't...

192
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,807
- I don't...
- You don't? Dude,

193
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:31,059
the sky is falling.

194
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:33,228
The sky is falling.

195
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,899
<i>And it's raining pussy!</i>

196
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,652
<i>It's raining pussy</i>

197
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:43,238
Dude, ever since
Deliverance, man,

198
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:46,200
I've been with a
different girl every day.

199
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:48,368
And they don't care
about getting pregnant.

200
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:51,205
They don't care about diseases,

201
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:52,414
or are you gonna
call them back,

202
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:53,832
or can you provide for them,

203
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:57,044
or do you have a small dick,

204
00:13:57,128 --> 00:14:00,172
or are you related. All right?

205
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:03,592
And it's like the apocalypse...

206
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:07,054
The apocalypse has
leveled the field, man.

207
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:11,183
Oh, my God.
Do you want to double-stuff that cookie?

208
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:14,895
<i>Do you want to double-stuff
that cookie with me?</i>

209
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,814
<i>Two chefs in the kitchen</i>

210
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:21,276
<i>We're double-stuffing the
cookie Dodge and Roache</i>

211
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:25,572
You guys, look!
Sarah and Dave brought heroin.

212
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:28,408
- It's time.
- Bucket list! Bucket list!

213
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:31,328
Wait, where's Lacey?
Let Lacey do it, she's a dental assistant.

214
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,746
- I'll do it.
- Yeah, you do it, Lace.

215
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,081
Here we go.

216
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:35,499
Don't grab, Roache.

217
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:38,210
Let's watch her, let's
everyone watch her do it.

218
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,378
Put some Radiohead on.

219
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:41,129
I want to do heroin
to Radiohead.

220
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:44,091
Yeah! Yeah!

221
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:47,010
This is dynamite!
Everybody, run!

222
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:51,098
I'm kidding! It's not.

223
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:53,976
It can't hurt you unless you
get about this close to it.

224
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:06,405
Are you hiding?

225
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:08,407
Yes.

226
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:14,830
You don't have to do heroin
if you don't want to, sweetie.

227
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,415
Look, I tried.

228
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:19,418
I just can't spend the last month
of my life getting to know someone.

229
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:20,502
It's ridiculous.

230
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,506
You don't like Karen?

231
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:27,342
I couldn't
possibly give a shit.

232
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:31,805
I'm not gonna sit across from
someone and hear all their stories,

233
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:34,474
even if she was someone
I could be interested in,

234
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,602
because I just...

235
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:40,647
I'm not sure that the month
between my wife leaving me

236
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:44,443
and the end of the world
sounds like good timing. Do you?

237
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:47,362
What... Hey... What are you
doing? What are you doing?

238
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,031
What?

239
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:50,782
- What?
- What?

240
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,993
You're Warren's.

241
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:54,453
No, I'm not.

242
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,206
Nobody's anybody's
anything anymore.

243
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:09,134
Why did Linda get to disappear?

244
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:15,015
Why does everybody else
get to do what they want?

245
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,894
I don't know what I want.

246
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,736
You can't run from this, Dodge.

247
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:48,316
Hello?

248
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:56,992
You okay?

249
00:17:58,577 --> 00:17:59,286
No.

250
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,583
How could I be so stupid?

251
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:09,212
I don't know.
I don't know you very well.

252
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:12,340
I'm never gonna
see my family again.

253
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,761
I missed the planes,
all of them.

254
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:20,682
I mean, God, it's the end of the
world and I'm still 15 minutes late.

255
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,019
I can hear my father say it now.
I can hear him say,

256
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,855
"Flaky and irresponsible,"
and he's right.

257
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:31,151
How could I do this?
I put my energy in the wrong places,

258
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,778
I give my time to
the wrong people.

259
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:34,196
I mean,
when I think of all the...

260
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,782
All the holidays I didn't
spend with my mum and dad

261
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:39,284
to be with some guy
I used to know.

262
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:43,872
Would you like to come in?

263
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,132
I won't steal anything
if you don't rape me.

264
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:57,219
Agreed.

265
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:10,148
My name's Penny.

266
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:11,274
I'm Dodge.

267
00:19:14,237 --> 00:19:16,112
How long have you lived here?

268
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:18,156
Three years. You?

269
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:21,368
I just broke up with someone.

270
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:22,911
Oh, I'm sorry.

271
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,162
No, I mean...

272
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:25,997
You know,
it was building to this.

273
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:29,417
He's just taking the night
to clear out his stuff.

274
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:31,878
I mean, it's always better
to sleep on the fire escape

275
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:34,089
than have pity sex,
I always say.

276
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,927
What's that?

277
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:42,347
What? Oh, that is cough
syrup with codeine.

278
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,850
- Splash of vodka.
- Can I have a sip?

279
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:46,685
Actually, I'm feeling a little...

280
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,062
You want some weed?

281
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:51,731
Oh, no, thank you.

282
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,442
It's the only thing
that sends me to sleep

283
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:56,361
and the only thing
that wakes me up again.

284
00:19:57,145 --> 00:19:57,863
I mean, seriously,

285
00:19:57,947 --> 00:19:59,489
I've got a wicked
case of hypersomnia.

286
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:00,949
I mean, I could sleep
through the apocalypse.

287
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,960
- Who's the girl?
- Who?

288
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,629
Oh. That's Olivia.

289
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:17,299
Is she the one that got away?

290
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:21,553
Well, they all got away,
but she was the first, yeah.

291
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:24,764
Are you gonna go
and get her back?

292
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:28,059
I'm sure she has
enough on her plate.

293
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,063
And what is it about
the end of the world

294
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:33,815
that brings them
all out of the woodwork?

295
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:55,629
There he's got it.

296
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:59,549
Yeah.
He changed his mind, as he...

297
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:04,638
doing a terrific
job of cutting him off.

298
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,599
Now coming from behind,

299
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:10,518
he's got him around the
shoulders, and down goes...

300
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:03,905
I'm ready to go downstairs now.

301
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,000
Wait here a tick.

302
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:16,251
Okay.

303
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:26,720
He's gone. Took my Pet Sounds with
him. I should've seen that coming.

304
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:34,602
So...

305
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:37,856
What are you doing
with the rest of your life?

306
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,110
Little of this, little of that.

307
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:45,196
Probably catching
up on some "me" time.

308
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:47,699
Find God.

309
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,617
Maybe move around some chairs.

310
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:54,205
Well, maybe I'll run into
you at a support group

311
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,373
or an orgy or something.

312
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:56,958
Yeah, that sounds nice.

313
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:00,462
What's that?

314
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:01,713
That's your mail.

315
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:03,548
Why do you have it?

316
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:06,384
Oh, you know how the mailman
would sometimes put the mail

317
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:07,719
In the wrong box?

318
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,972
Well, over time, say like...
Well, three years, I mean, it...

319
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:12,974
God, it really
adds up, doesn't it?

320
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,269
Isn't it funny?
I mean, how we've lived

321
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,229
so close and
we've never said hi.

322
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:20,482
Oh, but I did meet
your roommate a few times.

323
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,233
My roommate? You mean Linda?

324
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:25,445
Linda. Linda, right. And her
boyfriend, what was his name?

325
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:28,239
Oh, God, they seemed so happy
together. What was his name?

326
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:30,283
I haven't seen them in a
while. Are they all right?

327
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,910
What was his name again?

328
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:36,289
I forget.

329
00:24:01,524 --> 00:24:02,816
$8.50.

330
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:49,988
Come on.

331
00:25:31,906 --> 00:25:33,239
Give it to me! I'll hit it!

332
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:34,782
Fuck, yeah! Hit it!

333
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:02,101
What started as a few
individuals acting out

334
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:04,437
has quickly escalated
into a massive riot

335
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,689
sweeping through
the streets of downtown.

336
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:08,983
If we could show
the live footage, Dory?

337
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:11,402
Dory?

338
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:14,072
You see people using
every available weapon,

339
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:16,157
looting, smashing windows,

340
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:18,952
setting fires, and in some
cases, attacking one another.

341
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,246
With the lack of
police presence,

342
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,957
we are seeing people
with nothing left to lose.

343
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,877
They appear to be
moving off Main Street

344
00:26:27,962 --> 00:26:29,671
and heading towards
Division Avenue,

345
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:32,507
where residences and
businesses are more at risk.

346
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:35,593
And perhaps
it's only a matter of time

347
00:26:35,678 --> 00:26:38,137
before the city is
too dangerous to inhabit.

348
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:50,483
Oh, my God.

349
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:56,990
Oh, God.

350
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:06,541
Oh, God.

351
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:09,711
Okay. Okay.

352
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:17,135
Oh, Sorry. Okay.
Good, Sorry. Here we go.

353
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:19,554
Come on.

354
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:25,893
Penny?

355
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,735
Penny! Penny?

356
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:36,738
- Penny!
- Who the fuck are you?

357
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,324
Oh, shit! I'm sorry.

358
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:40,575
I'm sorry. I'm Dodge,
I live upstairs.

359
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:41,993
I've never seen you before.

360
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,661
We've run into each other a
few times, but that's not...

361
00:27:43,746 --> 00:27:45,913
I'm pretty good with faces.

362
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:49,375
Anyway... Obviously,
there's a riot going on.

363
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:53,171
Maybe you heard the
screaming, smelled the burning.

364
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:54,464
If you could
just wake up Penny,

365
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:56,507
I think we should get out of
the building as soon as possible.

366
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:57,967
Jesus.

367
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:01,304
You're fucking her, aren't you?

368
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,848
What? No... What? No, I'm...

369
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,016
No. I'm not.

370
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,142
Oh, I knew it!

371
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,020
I knew it.

372
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:11,773
Fuck! I knew it!

373
00:28:14,068 --> 00:28:15,193
Shit!

374
00:28:16,077 --> 00:28:16,694
Okay, all right.

375
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:18,821
Penny! Come on,
here we go. Wake up.

376
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:19,947
There you go.

377
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,032
Hey! I decide
when Penny wakes up!

378
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:22,533
This isn't what it looks like.

379
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:23,701
I broke my hand, baby.

380
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:25,870
I hope you're happy.
It's my guitar hand.

381
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,455
Aren't they both
your guitar hands?

382
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,665
Penny, there's a small riot brewing
and we need to go, right now!

383
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,084
She's not going
anywhere with you...

384
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:32,502
Would you please just stop?

385
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:35,713
We all need to go! Come on! Here we go!
Here we go, guys! Come on!

386
00:28:35,798 --> 00:28:38,800
My hand! My gift.
Will you just look at it? I broke it.

387
00:28:40,067 --> 00:28:40,927
This is the guy?

388
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:42,720
I can't believe you want
this creep instead of me.

389
00:28:42,805 --> 00:28:45,056
Hey! Hey! I'm not kidding!
Let's do it!

390
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,599
Oh, he's old!

391
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,227
He's not even good-looking.
What, do you have a job?

392
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:50,895
- Mister Job?
- Owen!

393
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:53,815
I told you there wasn't anybody else.
Oh, shit, my records.

394
00:28:54,817 --> 00:28:57,318
So you broke up
with me for nobody?

395
00:28:57,403 --> 00:28:59,028
Do you not see
how that's worse?

396
00:28:59,113 --> 00:29:00,696
We don't have time for this.

397
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:02,949
Scott Walker, Wilco...
John Cale!

398
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:04,158
Hey, that's my Cale.

399
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:05,993
We don't have time
for any of this, guys!

400
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:08,079
Goodbye, friends!

401
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,414
Come on.

402
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:10,748
Give me that Cale.

403
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:11,916
Okay, here we go.

404
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I'll drive.

405
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:15,002
- All right, all right.
- Hey!

406
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:16,838
Watch out for my hand.

407
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:18,297
Here we go.

408
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:22,093
I can't believe you're
breaking up with me now.

409
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:23,594
It's the worst timing
for me, ever!

410
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:24,804
We didn't get back together.

411
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,597
- What do you call last night?
- Nothing happened!

412
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:28,349
Since when is
snuggling nothing?

413
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:30,101
Shit. I thought
it was right there.

414
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:31,269
You don't remember
where you parked?

415
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:32,437
No, it was... It was on...

416
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:34,897
It was on 1st and 9th.
Fuck, maybe it was 10th and 2nd?

417
00:29:34,982 --> 00:29:36,274
- This way.
- It could have been 3rd...

418
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:38,526
It was definitely one
of those combinations.

419
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,611
I'm the asshole, right?
Everything's my fault?

420
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:42,113
Can we just concentrate
on finding the car?

421
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,781
No, Owen, it's not about that.

422
00:29:43,866 --> 00:29:45,032
I'm just saying
that we're not a match.

423
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:47,201
I mean, isn't it better we
find out now, rather than later?

424
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:48,744
No!

425
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:50,746
What do you mean,
not soul mates?

426
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:52,665
I love you.
I want to take care of you.

427
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:57,044
Just get...

428
00:29:57,671 --> 00:29:59,213
Penny, let's go, come on!

429
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:02,216
- Owen?
- Come on!

430
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:09,682
You okay?
Come on! Go for the car.

431
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:15,062
There it is!

432
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:18,399
Is this because
you pay my rent?

433
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:20,485
Because I had to swallow a lot
of pride to let you do that.

434
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:22,028
Get in the car, Owen.

435
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,323
I'm not leaving the city.

436
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:26,407
Well, it's my car.

437
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:28,451
Oh, that's right,
I don't have a car.

438
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:29,952
Throw that in my face
while you're at it.

439
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:31,162
They're right on top of us!

440
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,288
"They're right on top of us!"

441
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:34,290
- Would you get out and help?
- I'll do it!

442
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,125
No, no, no.
No, no, no. I'll do it.

443
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:37,168
Just...

444
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,795
Oh, God, there's a guy.
There's a guy right there!

445
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,881
Cut the wheel! Cut it!

446
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:44,008
What are you doing?
Cut the wheel!

447
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,843
- I'm...
- Cut the wheel!

448
00:30:45,928 --> 00:30:47,887
- Fire! Fire!
- There's fire!

449
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:48,971
You're not cutting at all!

450
00:30:49,256 --> 00:30:51,474
Are you freaking blind?

451
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:52,558
God, here they come!

452
00:30:52,643 --> 00:30:53,768
What is wrong with you?

453
00:30:54,937 --> 00:30:57,438
Hey! Hey!
I know a guy with a plane.

454
00:30:57,523 --> 00:31:00,775
If you drive me to where I need to
go, I can get you to your family.

455
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:03,110
Hello? Cut the wheel!

456
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:07,406
That's it. Now come
forward a little bit.

457
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:10,368
He'll be fine!

458
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,120
Hey!

459
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:17,708
So tell me about this plane.

460
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:34,892
You know, hybrid cars
don't need as much gas.

461
00:31:34,977 --> 00:31:37,979
Yes. They still need
a little gas, don't they?

462
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:41,774
No, I'm just saying, you don't
have to fill them up as much.

463
00:31:43,986 --> 00:31:46,237
Does this mean we're
not going to the plane?

464
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:49,574
Look, maybe you should
just forget about the plane.

465
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,243
I left Owen in
the middle of a riot.

466
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,078
He used you as
a human shield, Penny.

467
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,247
You don't even know him.

468
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:59,208
Look, you're the one who woke
me up in the middle of the night,

469
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:00,793
dragged me out of bed...
You're right.

470
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:03,921
I don't know why I bothered saving
your life, after you ruined mine.

471
00:32:04,006 --> 00:32:05,965
What is that supposed to mean?

472
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,387
What? What is that?

473
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:13,848
Well, you know how
sometimes the mailman

474
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,766
would put the mail
in the wrong box?

475
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:18,436
Well, sometimes, the girl
that you never got over

476
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,604
sends you a letter.

477
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:21,689
That's from the girl? My God.

478
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:23,899
Oh, my God!
That's great, right?

479
00:32:23,984 --> 00:32:25,401
Yeah, it's pretty good.

480
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:28,988
What would be great is if I could
call her from a regular phone,

481
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:31,449
or I could just hop
on a train to wherever,

482
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:33,451
or not die in
the outer suburbs.

483
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:36,078
But instead,
I am on the scenic route

484
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:38,956
to the guillotine
with you, and you.

485
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:44,211
She could be at the
fucking pyramids by now.

486
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:47,006
She could have blown her
head off, and I wouldn't know,

487
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,091
because I didn't get this

488
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:50,718
three annoying months ago!

489
00:32:54,598 --> 00:32:55,890
Now I feel bad.

490
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,977
Fuck. Look,
guilt isn't a feeling

491
00:33:00,062 --> 00:33:01,312
that I'm comfortable with.

492
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:05,650
Well, fortunately you won't
have long to live with it.

493
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:13,240
What are you doing?

494
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:14,825
Penny, this really
doesn't involve you.

495
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:17,119
I said I was gonna get you there,
I'm gonna get you there, so...

496
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:18,663
Where was the last place
you saw her?

497
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:20,373
Where was she 18 years ago?

498
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:23,000
Look, you don't need to spend
the last few days of your life

499
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:24,126
with a total stranger.

500
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:26,504
You're not a total stranger,
and these aren't my last days.

501
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:27,797
Oh, you're a survivalist.

502
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:29,757
No, I'm not a survivalist.
I'm an optimist.

503
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:31,634
- Hello!
- You having some trouble?

504
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,719
Do you know where the
nearest gas station is?

505
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:36,263
Yeah, but diesel is all they got left.
Where you headed?

506
00:33:37,224 --> 00:33:38,432
Where we headed, Dodge?

507
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:41,811
Somerset.

508
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:44,230
Somerset. Wherever that is.

509
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,941
I think Huntsville
might be as far as I'm going.

510
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,068
Great! Thank you!

511
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:05,126
So, what's your pilgrimage?

512
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,002
Because everybody's
headed somewhere.

513
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:09,964
Well, I'm going to see
my family, and he's...

514
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:12,466
He's looking for someone.

515
00:34:12,843 --> 00:34:14,176
Who is it you're looking for?

516
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,512
His high school sweetheart.

517
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,139
Is that right?

518
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:19,682
Well, there's no greater search

519
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:21,642
than that of lost love,
I'll give you that.

520
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:23,477
- You married?
- No, darling,

521
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:26,939
I never did walk the plank.
There was a special lady.

522
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:30,192
My Rita passed
seven years back.

523
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:33,237
You know, it's all about
who you lay down with

524
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,363
when the lights go out.

525
00:34:34,448 --> 00:34:37,074
Takes longer than it
should to figure that part.

526
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:42,204
Truth is, it's nice to have
some company for a change.

527
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:43,414
Even strangers.

528
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,751
Why don't you
tell us your life story?

529
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:48,419
Then we won't be
strangers anymore.

530
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:49,503
Yeah?

531
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:53,340
Well, sure. Let's see.
I was born in...

532
00:34:54,176 --> 00:34:58,804
Wait a minute. I should probably
tell Daddy's life story first,

533
00:34:58,889 --> 00:35:00,806
- so there's some context.
- Okay.

534
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,184
- Uptime?
- Groovy!

535
00:35:04,186 --> 00:35:06,937
Yeah. Daddy was born
in Skokie, Illinois.

536
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:10,816
And his dad was born in Okie.
Used to catch bass.

537
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:13,152
So they run a bunch of tests

538
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:15,196
and they all come back
with the same bad news.

539
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,490
Doctors give me
six months to live.

540
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:20,993
Then I go home, turn on the
TV, and they say three weeks.

541
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:23,245
If you ask me, a man is not
supposed to know when his time is up,

542
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:24,955
it's not natural.

543
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,708
That's when you find yourself
renting a gun and buying a bullet.

544
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:30,586
But that ain't
no way into heaven.

545
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:32,546
Isn't that right, Dodge?

546
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:36,383
No, I guess not.

547
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:39,804
I'm gonna go drain the snake.

548
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:41,222
You wanna join me?

549
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:44,767
No, thanks, I'm good.

550
00:35:53,235 --> 00:35:56,028
Okay, what a fucking weirdo.

551
00:35:57,012 --> 00:35:58,030
I think he's soulful.

552
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:01,659
Who drives around with shovels?
I don't trust him.

553
00:36:02,244 --> 00:36:05,538
Glen? What?
He told us his life story.

554
00:36:05,622 --> 00:36:07,998
Yes, and thank you
for that, by the way.

555
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:10,793
Do you know, if you actually
listened, you might learn something.

556
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,045
Sorry needs to go out.

557
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:14,713
I'll go. I will take him.

558
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:17,883
I'm gonna take him for a sniff.
Don't go anywhere.

559
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:29,728
I knew it as soon as I saw you.

560
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:35,818
That detached look in your eyes.
That vague way about you.

561
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:39,697
You almost had me
fooled with that line

562
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:40,906
about your
high school girlfriend.

563
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:43,868
I'm sorry, I don't...

564
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:45,286
Don't be sorry, son.

565
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:49,123
Just kill me quickly.

566
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:51,542
What?

567
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,252
Well, I thought we could
do it in that nice field,

568
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:55,671
but if you're gonna shoot me in the
back, then let's get it over with.

569
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:58,757
Shoot you? I don't...
Are we still speaking metaphorically?

570
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:03,095
Well, what's it gonna be, then?
Knife? Piano wire?

571
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,180
Okay, you know what?
She's gonna be back any second.

572
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:07,266
Don't tell me they sent
a girl to do a man's job.

573
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,143
I specifically
requested a male!

574
00:37:09,603 --> 00:37:11,478
Unless you're some sort of team!
Is that how this works?

575
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:14,815
Okay, you know what?
I don't think I am who you think I am.

576
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,701
Well, that's a relief.

577
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:29,204
Because I was afraid
I could fight you off!

578
00:37:31,124 --> 00:37:34,209
You know, Dodge, when a man...

579
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:42,593
Dodge? Glen?

580
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:46,055
Oh, my God.

581
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:48,098
Glen's dead.

582
00:37:48,642 --> 00:37:51,560
Are you okay?
Did you get the plates?

583
00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:57,191
"When a man..."

584
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,487
"When a man..." What do you
think he was trying to say?

585
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:03,280
I don't know, Penny.

586
00:38:03,365 --> 00:38:04,990
"When a man..."

587
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,159
Loves a woman?

588
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:10,329
"When a man..." Is a trucker?

589
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:12,247
The man...

590
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:14,625
The man committed
suicide via homicide

591
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,919
two weeks before
the apocalypse.

592
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:19,004
I'm not really concerned
with any Road Warriorwisdom

593
00:38:19,089 --> 00:38:21,882
I may have missed out on. Okay?

594
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,009
All right.

595
00:38:24,678 --> 00:38:27,346
I'll drive.
Do you have the keys?

596
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:34,228
Okay.

597
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:36,605
Okay.

598
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,865
You'd think a lifetime of
waiting for the worst to happen

599
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,951
would have
prepared me for this.

600
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:52,204
How could anyone
prepare for this?

601
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:56,750
I always knew.
I always knew it'd be over too soon.

602
00:38:57,919 --> 00:38:59,253
I never saw myself
as an old man.

603
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:00,838
Really?

604
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:06,760
I thought I was gonna live forever.
Was totally gonna peak at 40.

605
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:12,266
Well, I hear 30 is the new 40.

606
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:20,899
Luckily, I'm getting my mid-life
crisis in just under the wire.

607
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:24,737
She must be really special, Olivia?

608
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:27,865
To want to find her
after so much time.

609
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:30,325
She was, yeah.

610
00:39:30,744 --> 00:39:32,411
So why did you break up?

611
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:37,166
We were young.
We were not fully formed beings yet.

612
00:39:38,168 --> 00:39:40,377
Life just took us
in different directions.

613
00:39:40,462 --> 00:39:41,962
She dumped you?

614
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:44,640
Yes.

615
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:47,301
What about you?

616
00:39:47,469 --> 00:39:48,761
What about me?

617
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:50,387
Who's the one that got away?

618
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,306
I am, thank God.

619
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:54,725
I don't mean I'm anything
special, I just...

620
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:59,021
I'm glad that part of my life's
over with, you know? Relationships.

621
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:01,440
I thought you weren't cynical.

622
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:03,025
I'm not cynical. I'm...

623
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:05,194
I'm clinical.

624
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:08,822
I am a recovering
serial monogamist.

625
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:10,616
Sounds very serious.

626
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,950
Very serious.

627
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:13,702
I went to this
therapist who told me

628
00:40:13,787 --> 00:40:15,662
that I had problems
being alone.

629
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:18,207
But then, I mean, she wanted
to see me five times a week,

630
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:20,167
so you tell me
who had the real problem.

631
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,754
You know, if the end of the
world has taught me anything,

632
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:26,131
it's that I'm finally
getting my...

633
00:40:26,216 --> 00:40:27,716
Oh, my God.

634
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:30,812
Is that a Friendsy's?

635
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:33,639
I would kill for a pint.

636
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:45,192
Hi, welcome to Friendsy's,
where everyone's your friend!

637
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,194
- Hi!
- Hi!

638
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:51,406
Two for dinner? Yeah!

639
00:40:51,491 --> 00:40:52,574
Look at this little guy.

640
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:53,659
Is this okay?

641
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:55,494
Oh, yeah!
Everyone's welcome, yeah.

642
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:58,247
Dude brought in a wolf
last week. It's crazy!

643
00:40:58,331 --> 00:40:59,331
Come on in!

644
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:00,499
Okay.

645
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:02,126
Taquitos!

646
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,293
Yeah, three orders.

647
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:04,962
I can't believe
you guys are still open.

648
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:06,797
Yeah, we thought about
closing up shop,

649
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:10,509
but then we realized this is
really our family, you know?

650
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:13,929
In fact, the tragedy has brought us closer.
Some of us too close.

651
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:15,347
That's impossible.

652
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:17,349
And under new management,
it's a lot less corporate.

653
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:18,475
Right, Steven?

654
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,603
Right. I hope a booth is okay.

655
00:41:21,688 --> 00:41:22,646
Yeah, it's...

656
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,231
We burned all the chairs in a bonfire.

657
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,984
I'm gonna pass you
off to Katie, okay?

658
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:29,987
You're in warm hands with her.
My skin feels great!

659
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:32,322
Thanks, Darcy.
Isn't he incredible?

660
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:34,032
Hi, I'm Katie.

661
00:41:34,117 --> 00:41:35,409
Can you slide over, please?

662
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:36,702
Yeah.

663
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:38,745
- Can I touch your hair?
- Yeah.

664
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:41,456
- Oh, it's so soft.
- Thank you.

665
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:44,418
Can I get you guys something
to wet your whistle?

666
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:45,669
Everything's awesome!

667
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,671
- How are your mudslides?
- Fucking awesome!

668
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,590
- Can we get two mudslides?
- Yes.

669
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:50,674
Thank you.

670
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,509
Do you guys wanna
know the specials?

671
00:41:52,594 --> 00:41:54,261
Because these guys are
getting really creative.

672
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:56,346
No, just the mudslides.

673
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:02,895
Okay! Gotcha.
Guys, I'm rolling pretty hard right now,

674
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:05,022
but if you two
keep it super positive,

675
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:06,857
I will bring you
those M-slides.

676
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:09,902
And maybe an order of
spin-dip for the table.

677
00:42:09,986 --> 00:42:13,363
That is amazing! And you know what,
it's his birthday today.

678
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:16,450
Why didn't you tell me that?
Happy birthday!

679
00:42:17,752 --> 00:42:18,535
Thank you.

680
00:42:23,124 --> 00:42:24,541
I really hope you're
having a good time.

681
00:42:24,626 --> 00:42:25,709
Yeah, I am having fun.

682
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:29,046
I think that this place
is some sort of cult

683
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:30,380
and we probably
shouldn't eat anything.

684
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:32,216
Oh, you're crazy.
This is amazing.

685
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:35,219
Look, people are sitting down
together, everybody's happy. Hey!

686
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:37,262
There's a conga line.
Just like...

687
00:42:37,347 --> 00:42:41,058
This is a piece of American history.
It's a human landmark.

688
00:42:41,142 --> 00:42:43,477
It's a shout-out to
the man upstairs to say... Oh!

689
00:42:44,345 --> 00:42:46,730
I smell weed.
Excuse me! I smell weed.

690
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:49,775
Yeah, it's right this way.
Conga your way to a great time!

691
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:04,957
Is it good?

692
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:06,500
This bun is a donut.

693
00:43:08,628 --> 00:43:11,588
It's exactly what
you think a burger

694
00:43:11,673 --> 00:43:14,091
with a donut bun
would taste like.

695
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:18,845
What did you do?

696
00:43:18,972 --> 00:43:19,930
When?

697
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:22,391
You know, before,
like, as a living.

698
00:43:22,684 --> 00:43:24,351
I sold insurance.

699
00:43:26,688 --> 00:43:28,188
That's...

700
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:31,858
- Oh, you're serious.
- Yes, I am.

701
00:43:33,695 --> 00:43:37,656
Okay. How does...
How does somebody get into that field?

702
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:39,817
You dare to dream, Penny.

703
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:42,202
I don't know, you...

704
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:46,039
I guess you start with all
of your childhood fantasies

705
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:47,958
of being a fireman

706
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:50,627
or an athlete or whatever.

707
00:43:50,712 --> 00:43:52,462
And then eventually
reality hits,

708
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:55,257
and you realize that,
really, all you want

709
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:59,261
is to have a desk somewhere
with your name on it.

710
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:00,429
But why insurance?

711
00:44:00,513 --> 00:44:01,555
I didn't like law,

712
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:04,308
and the economy was
headed in one direction.

713
00:44:04,392 --> 00:44:05,976
I'm the type of person,
I just...

714
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,437
I feel more comfortable
with a safety net.

715
00:44:12,517 --> 00:44:13,817
Yeah.

716
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:17,070
So, go on.
How do you know a man with a plane?

717
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:19,197
I don't know him.
I said I knew him.

718
00:44:19,282 --> 00:44:22,451
I know, I know.
I'm not getting my hopes up. I'm just...

719
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:24,745
I'm just really excited.

720
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:27,164
Obviously.

721
00:44:27,248 --> 00:44:29,458
<i>With the Friendsy's family</i>

722
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:31,835
<i>It's your very last birthday</i>

723
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:33,378
<i>Happy birthday!</i>

724
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:35,422
<i>There'll never be another</i>

725
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:37,591
<i>So tell all your
sisters and brothers</i>

726
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:40,093
<i>It's your very last birthday</i>

727
00:44:41,304 --> 00:44:43,805
Happy birthday!

728
00:44:49,145 --> 00:44:51,396
Okay...

729
00:44:52,273 --> 00:44:54,316
That's... All right.

730
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:57,736
- Hi, buddy.
- Hi, there.

731
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,488
Can I join in?

732
00:45:00,073 --> 00:45:01,323
Look, I don't
wanna be rude, but...

733
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:02,407
Oh, God!

734
00:45:02,492 --> 00:45:03,992
Yeah, we should go.
We should go.

735
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:05,994
Okay. Sorry.

736
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:08,121
Here's some money.

737
00:45:08,456 --> 00:45:10,123
- Oh!
- All right. Come on, let's go.

738
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:14,002
All right, see you soon!
Okay, have a good night.

739
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,589
Let's get these off.

740
00:45:30,937 --> 00:45:32,396
They were...

741
00:45:36,818 --> 00:45:39,444
Oh, God.

742
00:45:52,834 --> 00:45:56,378
Dodge,
I want you to be my last.

743
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,757
That's a lot of pressure.

744
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:22,237
Listen, I...

745
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:24,448
Sorry, you go first.

746
00:46:24,532 --> 00:46:25,866
I wasn't saying anything.

747
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:27,409
It's just...

748
00:46:28,578 --> 00:46:31,580
I think I got a little
carried away before with

749
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:36,042
the mudslides and the orgy,

750
00:46:36,127 --> 00:46:41,047
and, you know, obviously, things
are very complicated right now.

751
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:43,508
What are you doing?

752
00:46:43,593 --> 00:46:45,010
I just want you
to know that I...

753
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:47,804
I wasn't trying
to take advantage.

754
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:53,310
Obviously, you're very young.
What are you, like 30? 31?

755
00:46:53,394 --> 00:46:56,897
- Twenty-eight.
- Oh, God. Oh!

756
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,484
God, you try to be
a good person...

757
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:02,194
Relax, Dodge. It was...

758
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:05,739
It was end-of-the-world sex.
It was creature comfort.

759
00:47:05,865 --> 00:47:07,199
- Well...
- If anything, it was my fault.

760
00:47:07,283 --> 00:47:08,283
You didn't do anything.

761
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:09,576
I think I did some things.

762
00:47:09,911 --> 00:47:11,870
It isn't gonna happen again, I promise.

763
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:14,331
You've got Olivia,
I've got my family.

764
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:16,666
You know, we both have
more important places to be.

765
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:18,335
Just... A little sex.
It was bound to happen,

766
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:20,128
let's not make
a big deal out of it.

767
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:22,923
I dated someone from Camden.

768
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:26,051
Listen, Penny, it...

769
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:32,057
I don't understand.

770
00:47:32,141 --> 00:47:33,266
What is he doing?

771
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:35,560
I guess he's...
Is he trying to pull us over?

772
00:47:35,645 --> 00:47:37,062
Oh, come on.
He can't be serious.

773
00:47:37,146 --> 00:47:38,355
How fast are you going?

774
00:47:38,439 --> 00:47:39,481
Who gives a shit?

775
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:40,524
Why aren't you slowing down?

776
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:41,650
I think we can take him.

777
00:47:41,734 --> 00:47:43,777
Hey! Hey! Hey! Slow down!

778
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:45,612
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

779
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:47,155
- Slow down! Pull the car over.
- Come on.

780
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:48,990
Don't you think that he must
have better things to do?

781
00:47:49,075 --> 00:47:50,200
Penny, pull the car over.

782
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:51,660
Jesus, what's he
gonna do, shoot us?

783
00:47:51,744 --> 00:47:54,079
There's a very real possibility
he could shoot us, yes!

784
00:47:54,163 --> 00:47:55,372
- All right! All right!
- Let's pull it over.

785
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:57,874
All right! God, but...

786
00:47:57,959 --> 00:48:00,168
But I should warn you,
my dad's ex-military

787
00:48:00,253 --> 00:48:02,754
and he says I have a really
serious problem with authority.

788
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:05,090
Put that away, please.
Give that.

789
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:06,466
No, it's all I've got left

790
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:08,176
and I'm trying to ration it.
Come on.

791
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:09,719
What do I do with it?

792
00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:11,304
Oh, just...
Just put it in your mouth.

793
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:16,643
That was still lit.

794
00:48:21,357 --> 00:48:23,775
Hello, Officer, what
seems to be the problem?

795
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:25,652
Well, for starters,

796
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:28,738
you're driving about 15 miles
an hour over the speed limit.

797
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:30,865
Really?

798
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:32,659
I thought I was making
better time than that.

799
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:37,080
And you know,
you got a tail light out.

800
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:38,832
- No.
- Yeah.

801
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:43,295
Also, your plates
expired about a month ago.

802
00:48:43,713 --> 00:48:45,338
Go on.

803
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:49,509
That's it. That's everything.

804
00:48:50,136 --> 00:48:51,261
Those three things.

805
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:52,929
Well, why don't you
write us out

806
00:48:53,014 --> 00:48:55,473
any number of expensive,
time-sensitive tickets,

807
00:48:55,558 --> 00:48:57,517
and we'll be on our way?

808
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:01,104
I need some identification.

809
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:02,939
Of course. My name is Penny,

810
00:49:03,024 --> 00:49:04,149
and this is Dodge.

811
00:49:04,233 --> 00:49:05,233
Hi.

812
00:49:05,985 --> 00:49:08,111
Okay. License and registration.

813
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:09,654
Well, you see, that's
where we've got a problem,

814
00:49:09,739 --> 00:49:13,241
because I didn't get a chance
to retrieve my identification

815
00:49:13,326 --> 00:49:15,452
before fleeing my home
during a deadly riot.

816
00:49:15,536 --> 00:49:17,454
However, we were
fortunate enough

817
00:49:17,538 --> 00:49:19,581
to hitch a ride with
a very nice trucker,

818
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:22,959
who, turns out, had hired a hit
man to assist him in a suicide,

819
00:49:23,044 --> 00:49:24,628
thus bestowing us with this...

820
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:26,296
This beautiful mode
of transportation.

821
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:31,801
So, the answer is no, no
license or registration here.

822
00:49:32,553 --> 00:49:36,056
However, given the current
situation with the...

823
00:49:39,602 --> 00:49:41,269
Couldn't you find it
in your heart

824
00:49:41,354 --> 00:49:43,146
to set aside the law
just this once

825
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:46,191
and let us on our way, so
that I can give my friend here

826
00:49:46,275 --> 00:49:48,485
a fighting chance of
being with the one he loves

827
00:49:48,569 --> 00:49:51,571
before we all reach
our untimely conclusion?

828
00:49:59,288 --> 00:50:00,497
No.

829
00:50:03,584 --> 00:50:04,959
All right.

830
00:50:05,753 --> 00:50:08,338
Oh, excuse me,
do we get a phone call?

831
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:09,381
No, phones are dead.

832
00:50:09,465 --> 00:50:10,465
Okay.

833
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:11,966
Have fun.

834
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:17,222
Hello? What are you in for?

835
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:19,099
Disturbing the peace.

836
00:50:19,983 --> 00:50:20,684
Brilliant.

837
00:50:21,936 --> 00:50:23,645
Well, might as well
get comfortable.

838
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:25,397
This is as good
a place to die as any.

839
00:50:27,066 --> 00:50:28,441
I ruined your life.

840
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:30,610
No, you didn't.

841
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:33,738
Oh, yes, I did.

842
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:37,992
I ruined my life,
and I took you down with me.

843
00:50:38,077 --> 00:50:41,454
I was a terrible neighbor,
and I'm a...

844
00:50:42,123 --> 00:50:43,790
I'm an awful daughter.

845
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:46,251
Hey. Hey.

846
00:50:58,222 --> 00:50:59,931
Look at him.

847
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:03,810
Sound asleep in his sandwich board.
You know why?

848
00:51:04,353 --> 00:51:06,438
'Cause he always knew
the end was near.

849
00:51:07,106 --> 00:51:08,940
And he's currently
not surprised.

850
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:13,027
You are looking at
a vindicated man.

851
00:51:14,238 --> 00:51:15,947
How come you're not
with your family?

852
00:51:17,116 --> 00:51:18,742
I don't really have any.

853
00:51:20,828 --> 00:51:22,495
What do you mean?

854
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:26,624
My mother passed away,

855
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:32,130
and my father drove away
a long time ago.

856
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:37,010
My wife recently ran away, as
fast as any human woman could.

857
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:40,764
It only took Armageddon
to give her the courage.

858
00:51:40,848 --> 00:51:43,057
Which is ironic, because

859
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:50,064
being afraid of dying alone is why
I got married in the first place.

860
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:53,234
Your roommate was your wife.

861
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:56,738
My wife was my roommate.

862
00:51:58,365 --> 00:51:59,824
Should have listened
to my mother.

863
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:03,995
Even after she got sick, she
always made the most sense.

864
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:07,040
You would have liked her.

865
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:10,919
She would have liked you, too.

866
00:52:11,921 --> 00:52:13,379
You think so?

867
00:52:15,591 --> 00:52:17,133
She died alone.

868
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:20,094
Guess it doesn't matter now.

869
00:52:21,514 --> 00:52:23,056
How long since
you've seen your dad?

870
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:26,392
Twenty-five years?

871
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:29,979
Twenty-five years?

872
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:33,566
Well, don't you have
anything to say to him?

873
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:35,109
Nothing good.

874
00:52:36,612 --> 00:52:38,279
Well, what about Olivia?

875
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:42,534
We were together
on and off for ten years.

876
00:52:42,618 --> 00:52:45,078
She wanted to get married.
I didn't pull the trigger.

877
00:52:45,746 --> 00:52:47,247
Somebody else did.

878
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:51,543
And then I met Linda, and
the rest is almost history.

879
00:52:51,627 --> 00:52:55,171
What did she say,
Olivia, in her letter?

880
00:52:55,256 --> 00:52:57,549
She said she and her
husband had gotten divorced,

881
00:52:57,633 --> 00:53:00,552
and that she had a
6-year-old son named Marcus,

882
00:53:00,636 --> 00:53:02,345
and she asked about my parents,

883
00:53:03,264 --> 00:53:04,806
and she said she missed me.

884
00:53:05,474 --> 00:53:09,853
You know, garden-variety "end
of the world" mumbo jumbo.

885
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:13,189
I did ruin your life.

886
00:53:13,274 --> 00:53:14,816
No, you didn't.

887
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:17,569
I had a really long head start.

888
00:53:21,991 --> 00:53:24,117
Oh, man, I don't feel good.

889
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:28,288
Is that the weed kicking in?

890
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:30,790
What does it feel like?

891
00:53:30,875 --> 00:53:32,208
Feels like
I'm falling off a cliff

892
00:53:32,293 --> 00:53:33,793
with a bomb
strapped to my chest.

893
00:53:34,837 --> 00:53:36,296
Well, that could be anything.

894
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:15,335
Damn it, Wally!

895
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:19,047
There you go.
Look who's here. Look who's here.

896
00:54:19,173 --> 00:54:20,340
Hey, hey, hey. Come here.

897
00:54:20,424 --> 00:54:21,591
There you go.

898
00:54:22,843 --> 00:54:24,260
Well, sorry, folks,

899
00:54:24,345 --> 00:54:27,805
but Wally's been taking the
quota pretty serious these days,

900
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:30,516
and I'm afraid that...

901
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:32,894
Well, your truck was impounded.

902
00:54:34,188 --> 00:54:36,940
Is there some place
I can drop you folks?

903
00:54:38,192 --> 00:54:39,233
Delaware.

904
00:54:40,361 --> 00:54:42,111
Yeah... No.

905
00:54:43,572 --> 00:54:45,531
How far is it to Camden?

906
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,534
No matter where
the impact occurs,

907
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:50,870
it will create a firestorm
that will wipe out all life.

908
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:03,549
Thank you!

909
00:55:08,222 --> 00:55:09,514
So how long
were you with this guy?

910
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:10,890
Total?

911
00:55:11,475 --> 00:55:13,226
Nine months, plus six more.

912
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:16,145
How do you know
he's going to be here?

913
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:18,940
He's always here.

914
00:55:29,118 --> 00:55:30,576
There he is.

915
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,792
Penny.

916
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:39,127
Hey, Speck.

917
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:44,465
Oh, my goodness.

918
00:55:48,036 --> 00:55:49,387
I knew you'd come back.

919
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:51,347
No, I'm not back. I...

920
00:55:51,432 --> 00:55:52,932
We were just
in the neighborhood.

921
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:54,517
I haven't seen
this girl in 12 months

922
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:56,853
and she's just
in the neighborhood.

923
00:55:56,937 --> 00:55:58,229
Lance Corporal James Speck.

924
00:55:58,355 --> 00:55:59,689
Speck, this is Dodge...

925
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:01,566
Lieutenant Colonel
Dodge Petersen.

926
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:03,526
Look, we're in
a bit of a pickle,

927
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:06,154
and I was hoping that
you could help us out.

928
00:56:06,947 --> 00:56:08,948
Helping you out of a pickle
should be my middle name.

929
00:56:09,283 --> 00:56:10,283
Na-hah!

930
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:15,621
Come on.
Bring your little amigo.

931
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:18,791
You have to leave
the dog up top.

932
00:56:18,876 --> 00:56:20,710
Mom just vacuumed
the bomb shelter.

933
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:23,629
Come on,
I'll show you the digs.

934
00:56:24,465 --> 00:56:25,631
Fellas.

935
00:56:25,758 --> 00:56:26,883
Hey.

936
00:56:27,051 --> 00:56:28,176
That's Entertainment.

937
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,139
Sports and Recreation.

938
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:36,100
And if nature calls...

939
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:37,560
Hey.

940
00:56:39,688 --> 00:56:41,773
As you can see,
we have enough rations

941
00:56:41,857 --> 00:56:44,484
to live down here comfortably
for a good six months.

942
00:56:45,027 --> 00:56:47,904
These walls are 12
inches of pure titanium.

943
00:56:50,190 --> 00:56:51,491
Yeah, I was going to say 11.

944
00:56:52,076 --> 00:56:53,868
Resurfacing won't be that easy.

945
00:56:53,994 --> 00:56:55,828
The world will need
a strong leader.

946
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:58,289
Is that a satellite phone?

947
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:00,416
It is. You want to
call your folks?

948
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:02,251
What?

949
00:57:02,336 --> 00:57:04,921
Yeah, I was talking
to your dad the other day.

950
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:07,340
What time is it
across the pond, 1600?

951
00:57:07,883 --> 00:57:08,966
I don't know.

952
00:57:20,896 --> 00:57:22,355
Mum?

953
00:57:24,024 --> 00:57:25,483
It's me.

954
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:28,236
Yeah, yeah, no, no, no.
I'm fine. We got out.

955
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:31,489
Me and a friend.

956
00:57:34,034 --> 00:57:36,077
Yeah, he is.

957
00:57:39,915 --> 00:57:41,374
Hi, Dad.

958
00:57:45,796 --> 00:57:47,547
I miss you like crazy.

959
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:55,221
Tell me everything.
How's the garden? Is everyone there?

960
00:57:57,141 --> 00:57:59,934
Is that Benny?
Yeah, yeah. Put him on.

961
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:07,567
Oh, you twat.

962
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:11,070
No. You're mental.

963
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,116
Oh, my God.

964
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:18,077
Oh, I hear the baby.

965
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:22,623
Is that my niece?

966
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:25,793
Yeah.

967
00:58:27,087 --> 00:58:28,921
She sounds beautiful.

968
00:58:31,175 --> 00:58:33,009
What did you name her?

969
00:58:45,105 --> 00:58:48,441
You have a lot of guns
and a lot of potato chips.

970
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:53,821
Yeah, gotta be safe.

971
00:58:55,866 --> 00:58:57,950
So how long
you known our Penny?

972
00:58:58,035 --> 00:58:59,452
About a week.

973
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:02,580
Give or take.

974
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:04,248
So what's your pitch?

975
00:59:04,333 --> 00:59:05,541
My pitch?

976
00:59:05,626 --> 00:59:07,460
'Cause let me tell you
something about that girl.

977
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:10,129
She may be a romantic
on the outside,

978
00:59:10,214 --> 00:59:12,632
but on the inside
she's all survivor.

979
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:17,053
And she knows her
best chance of survival

980
00:59:17,137 --> 00:59:19,472
is sitting right here,
and I'm talking about me.

981
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:22,934
Can we restart civilization without her?

982
00:59:23,018 --> 00:59:24,477
Sure.

983
00:59:25,187 --> 00:59:28,189
But she deserves to be one of the
top quality females in contention.

984
00:59:30,651 --> 00:59:32,985
There's no room for you, dude.

985
00:59:33,362 --> 00:59:34,820
That's okay.

986
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:37,782
Got a pretty good lead
on a school desk.

987
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,702
There she is.

988
00:59:41,787 --> 00:59:42,828
We should go.

989
00:59:43,205 --> 00:59:44,455
I thought you were staying.

990
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:47,833
I promised I'd take him
somewhere. Can we...

991
00:59:48,877 --> 00:59:50,336
Can we borrow one
from the fleet?

992
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:58,010
Are you sure you don't want
a fallout tablet for the road?

993
00:59:58,095 --> 00:59:59,845
That's okay, thanks.

994
01:00:03,074 --> 01:00:04,892
The car's a loan, Penny.

995
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:08,271
I want to see it back
here with you in it.

996
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:20,783
Thank you.

997
01:00:21,702 --> 01:00:23,202
For everything.

998
01:00:25,122 --> 01:00:27,248
I should have married you.

999
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:29,458
When?

1000
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:33,212
When you would've said yes.

1001
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:42,888
Dodgy-Dodge.

1002
01:00:44,224 --> 01:00:45,599
Keep her out of trouble.

1003
01:00:52,274 --> 01:00:53,733
You okay?

1004
01:00:55,569 --> 01:00:57,236
They sounded good.

1005
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:01,741
They sounded really good.

1006
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:23,929
My dry cleaner.

1007
01:01:24,814 --> 01:01:26,098
Meatball subs at Zuzu's.

1008
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,772
Ducks pond in the summertime.

1009
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:35,066
Riding the subway.

1010
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:38,194
Oh, you lost me there.
Nobody misses the subway.

1011
01:01:38,278 --> 01:01:40,696
No, I did some of my best
people-watching on the subway.

1012
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:44,533
How about things that
we are not going to miss?

1013
01:01:44,618 --> 01:01:47,286
Like going to the dentist.

1014
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:50,081
Dr. Hoberman.

1015
01:01:50,749 --> 01:01:53,542
Oh, my God.

1016
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:56,504
Dr. Hoberman.

1017
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:31,705
That's it.

1018
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:35,334
I cannot tell you how
many hours I spent out here

1019
01:02:35,419 --> 01:02:37,086
obsessing over that window.

1020
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:38,170
Which window?

1021
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:39,255
Right there.

1022
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:42,508
That's a good window.

1023
01:02:44,168 --> 01:02:45,636
I don't think anybody's home.

1024
01:02:46,346 --> 01:02:48,180
Oh, come on, we have to try.

1025
01:02:49,006 --> 01:02:50,850
I'll be right here
if you need me.

1026
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:17,710
Nobody's home.

1027
01:03:17,878 --> 01:03:18,878
Try the knob.

1028
01:03:26,261 --> 01:03:27,720
You know what,
she's definitely not here.

1029
01:03:29,264 --> 01:03:33,225
Well, we've driven all this way

1030
01:03:33,894 --> 01:03:36,562
and it has definitely
not been in vain.

1031
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:39,398
You know what?
I think there's a hide-a-key.

1032
01:03:39,483 --> 01:03:42,067
Okay, here we...

1033
01:03:44,905 --> 01:03:46,447
Go.

1034
01:03:47,741 --> 01:03:49,450
You are insane.

1035
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:52,203
Come on.

1036
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:07,092
Looks the same.
Smells the same.

1037
01:04:07,928 --> 01:04:10,012
So what are we looking for?

1038
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:12,181
Something with
an address, I guess.

1039
01:04:19,940 --> 01:04:21,190
Oh, my God!

1040
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:22,441
What? What?

1041
01:04:22,526 --> 01:04:25,694
We have exactly the same
wallpaper in our kitchen!

1042
01:04:26,379 --> 01:04:27,279
Don't do that, please.

1043
01:04:27,364 --> 01:04:28,864
Isn't that wild?

1044
01:04:31,284 --> 01:04:33,994
Okay.

1045
01:04:38,959 --> 01:04:41,627
Oh. Oh, I love this house.

1046
01:04:47,342 --> 01:04:49,552
And I can make
something with this.

1047
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:51,804
I'll go check the bedrooms.

1048
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:54,974
Yeah, we used to break into
people's houses when we were kids,

1049
01:04:55,058 --> 01:04:56,392
me and my brothers.

1050
01:04:56,476 --> 01:04:58,561
I mean, we wouldn't
steal anything.

1051
01:04:58,645 --> 01:05:01,647
We'd just eat their ice
cream and watch cable.

1052
01:05:10,874 --> 01:05:12,575
Then this one time, Benny,

1053
01:05:12,659 --> 01:05:14,743
who must've been
about, like, seven,

1054
01:05:14,828 --> 01:05:16,453
he took off all his clothes

1055
01:05:16,538 --> 01:05:18,122
and he got onto this old
man's exercise bike...

1056
01:05:18,206 --> 01:05:19,248
Penny?

1057
01:05:55,109 --> 01:05:57,369
How long was I out?

1058
01:05:57,454 --> 01:05:59,538
Couple of hours.
Think you needed it.

1059
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:03,042
Well, I've lost a third
of my life to sleep,

1060
01:06:03,126 --> 01:06:04,460
what's another couple of hours?

1061
01:06:04,544 --> 01:06:05,669
Can you grab the wine?

1062
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:06,920
Yeah.

1063
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:13,669
Okay, so explain this to me.

1064
01:06:14,054 --> 01:06:16,847
You picked the tomatoes,
you made the sauce.

1065
01:06:17,641 --> 01:06:19,350
You went out and
harvested the wheat.

1066
01:06:19,434 --> 01:06:21,477
Yes, I harvested the wheat.

1067
01:06:21,561 --> 01:06:23,354
That was actually good.

1068
01:06:23,438 --> 01:06:25,648
I don't know.
It was the best I could do,

1069
01:06:25,732 --> 01:06:30,027
but just imagine a big juicy
ham instead of the canned beets.

1070
01:06:30,195 --> 01:06:31,737
Perfect.

1071
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:35,991
How could anyone
abandon this face?

1072
01:06:36,076 --> 01:06:37,868
Look at that little face.

1073
01:06:37,952 --> 01:06:41,413
Look, look, he's got
bits of gray in his beard.

1074
01:06:41,498 --> 01:06:42,665
Highlights.

1075
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:48,170
What'd you do? Before.

1076
01:06:48,254 --> 01:06:49,963
I think you could
say that I dabbled.

1077
01:06:50,965 --> 01:06:52,132
How did you learn
to cook like this?

1078
01:06:53,635 --> 01:06:56,178
I watched everything my mum
did and did the exact opposite.

1079
01:06:57,597 --> 01:06:59,348
My dad had the real talent,

1080
01:06:59,432 --> 01:07:01,350
and my mum was
sort of a cheerleader.

1081
01:07:03,603 --> 01:07:06,438
You've never seen
two people more in love.

1082
01:07:07,107 --> 01:07:08,649
I think that's the reason
I can never settle

1083
01:07:08,733 --> 01:07:10,025
for anything less than amazing.

1084
01:07:10,485 --> 01:07:12,945
You know?
They made it look so easy.

1085
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:17,658
There's a reason that opposites
are supposed to attract.

1086
01:07:18,827 --> 01:07:21,370
I'm the result of two
romantics getting together.

1087
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:23,038
I'm totally screwed.

1088
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:27,960
I love this song.

1089
01:07:30,964 --> 01:07:34,091
I can't believe I nearly
never heard it again.

1090
01:07:34,968 --> 01:07:36,885
You know, this was the
first record I ever got.

1091
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:40,055
I stole it from my dad's collection.
Pretended that he didn't know,

1092
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:42,474
and then I'd hear him
whistling it the whole time.

1093
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:43,793
Just to torture me.

1094
01:07:44,477 --> 01:07:45,894
Is that how you
got into records?

1095
01:07:45,979 --> 01:07:48,147
Yeah, he started it, but...

1096
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:53,819
I don't know, I just...
I love records.

1097
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:56,488
I mean, they're not
for everyone, you know?

1098
01:07:56,573 --> 01:07:58,741
You really have to
take care of vinyl.

1099
01:07:58,825 --> 01:08:01,785
It's very delicate,
it can get wrecked so easily.

1100
01:08:02,412 --> 01:08:04,496
You really have to love it.

1101
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,375
Do you hear how full it sounds?

1102
01:08:10,837 --> 01:08:14,757
Now, what you want to buy is a
thicker record. They're more stable.

1103
01:08:14,841 --> 01:08:17,301
The grooves in them are
sort of deeper and wider.

1104
01:08:17,385 --> 01:08:18,761
You get more detail.

1105
01:08:18,845 --> 01:08:22,306
I mean, they're harder to carry
around 'cause they're heavier,

1106
01:08:22,390 --> 01:08:24,183
but they're worth it.

1107
01:08:24,893 --> 01:08:26,351
You know,
my parents have this...

1108
01:08:26,895 --> 01:08:31,815
It's an amazing turntable.
It's vintage, cherry wood Victor 45.

1109
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:35,152
Oh! Perfect tone.
All the original parts.

1110
01:08:37,697 --> 01:08:39,907
I can't wait to hear it again.

1111
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:48,207
So, what else are you going
to do when you go home?

1112
01:08:51,169 --> 01:08:52,795
I'm going to...

1113
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:56,298
I'm going to listen
to my mum play piano.

1114
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:59,510
I'm gonna sit
in my dad's garden.

1115
01:08:59,594 --> 01:09:01,887
He grows the most ridiculous sunflowers.
They're like 10 feet tall.

1116
01:09:03,723 --> 01:09:05,891
I'm going to hang out
with my brothers.

1117
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:08,936
I'm gonna play with
my niece and my nephews.

1118
01:09:10,605 --> 01:09:13,565
I'm gonna do all the things
I missed out on for so long.

1119
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:15,234
That sounds great.

1120
01:09:15,318 --> 01:09:16,735
It is.

1121
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:22,574
I'm not gonna waste my time
on the wrong person.

1122
01:09:22,659 --> 01:09:25,202
I'm not gonna
waste my parents' time

1123
01:09:25,286 --> 01:09:28,247
introducing them to
some future stranger.

1124
01:09:29,499 --> 01:09:31,875
And no more days spent picking
out what you're gonna wear

1125
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:33,794
for nights that
don't mean anything.

1126
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:37,256
No more wondering whether
you're with the right person,

1127
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:40,843
or if this is the guy that
you're meant to have kids with.

1128
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:43,929
All those ridiculous questions.

1129
01:09:47,267 --> 01:09:49,268
It's liberating.
That's what it is.

1130
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:56,441
Maybe you just haven't
met the right guy.

1131
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:08,328
You're a really nice person.

1132
01:10:13,126 --> 01:10:15,794
You are an awful
judge of character.

1133
01:10:32,478 --> 01:10:33,604
I'm gonna fix that.

1134
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:37,149
Okay.

1135
01:10:42,572 --> 01:10:44,990
What do you think
Sorry would like to do?

1136
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:48,785
I don't know.
Lay in the sun somewhere.

1137
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:50,120
We could look for a Frisbee.

1138
01:10:50,204 --> 01:10:51,997
Or I could set up
a squirrel hunt.

1139
01:10:52,081 --> 01:10:53,248
Do you think he's horny?

1140
01:10:53,333 --> 01:10:56,168
Oh, yes, I think he is
definitely girl-crazy.

1141
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:03,216
Maybe he wants
to find his owner.

1142
01:11:03,301 --> 01:11:04,760
You know, abandonment issues?

1143
01:11:07,013 --> 01:11:09,264
You know what?
Maybe we're enough for him.

1144
01:11:09,349 --> 01:11:11,850
I don't know,
he seems comfortable.

1145
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:20,651
What is it?

1146
01:11:21,861 --> 01:11:23,654
It has a return address.

1147
01:11:29,452 --> 01:11:30,911
Is it close?

1148
01:11:32,163 --> 01:11:33,705
Yeah, it's pretty close.

1149
01:11:34,374 --> 01:11:35,874
That's great.

1150
01:11:42,382 --> 01:11:43,632
So...

1151
01:11:43,716 --> 01:11:45,133
We'll go first thing tomorrow.

1152
01:11:45,218 --> 01:11:46,677
Okay.

1153
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:49,638
Okay.

1154
01:13:35,119 --> 01:13:37,370
Should I...

1155
01:13:37,622 --> 01:13:38,997
Should I disappear?

1156
01:13:39,499 --> 01:13:41,083
No, stay here in the car.

1157
01:14:19,372 --> 01:14:20,872
What happened?

1158
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:24,042
What's happening?

1159
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:28,547
Was she home?

1160
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:31,716
Yeah, I think so.

1161
01:14:32,635 --> 01:14:35,971
Did you knock?
Why are we driving away?

1162
01:14:37,056 --> 01:14:40,392
I wrote her a letter. I put it on her door.
She should get it soon.

1163
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:44,354
You wrote her a letter?
Well, what did it say?

1164
01:14:45,690 --> 01:14:46,898
It just... It doesn't matter.

1165
01:14:47,817 --> 01:14:50,110
I don't understand. Why don't you
want to see her? What's happened?

1166
01:14:50,194 --> 01:14:51,653
We really can't
talk about this, Penny.

1167
01:14:51,737 --> 01:14:52,696
Why not?

1168
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:54,239
Because I don't want it
to change anything.

1169
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:55,490
Change what?

1170
01:14:55,825 --> 01:14:57,159
You have somewhere
you need to be.

1171
01:14:57,243 --> 01:14:59,244
And what about you?
What's changed?

1172
01:15:02,081 --> 01:15:02,898
Dodge!

1173
01:16:16,155 --> 01:16:17,364
You're not taking
this very seriously.

1174
01:16:17,448 --> 01:16:19,449
No, it's very good.

1175
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:28,583
Wait. Keep practicing.

1176
01:16:29,418 --> 01:16:30,835
Hey!

1177
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:49,497
Where are we?

1178
01:17:50,041 --> 01:17:51,499
Come on.

1179
01:18:11,312 --> 01:18:12,479
Who's there?

1180
01:18:15,858 --> 01:18:17,275
Frank?

1181
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:25,950
Hi, Frank.

1182
01:18:28,788 --> 01:18:30,372
Dodge.

1183
01:18:31,374 --> 01:18:32,957
Is it a bad time?

1184
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:39,130
Why, no. No, of course not.
Come in. Please, come in.

1185
01:18:41,467 --> 01:18:43,134
Thank you.

1186
01:18:46,472 --> 01:18:48,223
Dodger!

1187
01:18:48,307 --> 01:18:50,016
I can't believe it.
You're here,

1188
01:18:50,101 --> 01:18:51,768
you're really here.
Who's your friend?

1189
01:18:53,186 --> 01:18:53,728
This is Penny.

1190
01:18:53,813 --> 01:18:55,146
- Penny, this is Frank.
- Hi.

1191
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:56,981
Hi. I'm his father.

1192
01:18:57,817 --> 01:19:00,777
Oh! Oh, it's lovely
to meet you.

1193
01:19:00,861 --> 01:19:02,320
You, too!

1194
01:19:03,239 --> 01:19:06,533
Welcome.
Well, you must be hungry or something.

1195
01:19:06,617 --> 01:19:09,077
Actually, I was hoping that
I could talk to you for a minute.

1196
01:19:09,161 --> 01:19:11,621
Sure. Go right
in there. Go ahead.

1197
01:19:11,705 --> 01:19:12,747
Is there a restroom?

1198
01:19:12,832 --> 01:19:15,250
Yeah, right at the top
of the stairs. Here.

1199
01:19:15,334 --> 01:19:16,751
- There you are.
- Thank you.

1200
01:19:16,836 --> 01:19:19,087
Top of the steps on your left.
There you go.

1201
01:19:19,171 --> 01:19:20,755
- What's the dog's name?
- Sorry.

1202
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:22,590
- What?
- Sorry?

1203
01:19:29,682 --> 01:19:31,099
She your girlfriend?

1204
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:33,017
I don't know.

1205
01:19:33,477 --> 01:19:34,477
She should be.

1206
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:43,361
Did we get old or what?

1207
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:50,994
So you're here to tell me
all the things I did wrong?

1208
01:19:51,871 --> 01:19:53,705
No, you know all the
things you did wrong.

1209
01:19:53,789 --> 01:19:55,206
I came here to
ask you something.

1210
01:19:56,667 --> 01:19:58,293
I know I could have
handled things differently.

1211
01:19:58,377 --> 01:20:00,170
I don't want to talk about it.

1212
01:20:01,839 --> 01:20:03,548
You know, your mother
didn't make it any easier...

1213
01:20:03,632 --> 01:20:06,134
Don't. Don't say
another word about her.

1214
01:20:09,138 --> 01:20:11,055
We were so young
when you were born...

1215
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:13,725
And now you're not,
and neither am I.

1216
01:20:14,518 --> 01:20:16,769
And we had our whole
lives to figure it out.

1217
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:19,481
I'm just trying
to say I'm sorry.

1218
01:20:19,565 --> 01:20:21,941
Well, just say it, then.

1219
01:20:24,487 --> 01:20:25,904
I'm sorry.

1220
01:20:33,245 --> 01:20:35,079
Now what?

1221
01:20:35,915 --> 01:20:39,209
I don't know.
You were the one with the question.

1222
01:20:42,588 --> 01:20:43,838
I guess I just couldn't believe

1223
01:20:43,923 --> 01:20:45,298
you didn't wanna see
your old man again.

1224
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:48,343
Your mother wouldn't
take my calls,

1225
01:20:48,427 --> 01:20:51,304
she ripped up all my
cards and letters to you,

1226
01:20:51,388 --> 01:20:52,847
but, you know, I figured
when you got older...

1227
01:20:52,932 --> 01:20:55,308
Not that it was on you, no, no.

1228
01:20:55,392 --> 01:20:56,935
No, I did that.

1229
01:20:58,687 --> 01:21:01,606
I know I lost all my
privileges when I left.

1230
01:21:07,947 --> 01:21:09,656
You know, when you were a baby,

1231
01:21:09,740 --> 01:21:12,325
she used to hold you
so tight sometimes,

1232
01:21:12,409 --> 01:21:14,869
I thought you couldn't breathe.

1233
01:21:17,414 --> 01:21:19,499
Maybe that was just me.

1234
01:21:24,463 --> 01:21:26,297
I really am sorry.

1235
01:21:30,302 --> 01:21:32,136
It doesn't matter anymore.

1236
01:21:34,765 --> 01:21:36,975
We're in the same place now.

1237
01:21:37,977 --> 01:21:40,979
Well, I know I wasn't
there for you back then.

1238
01:21:44,567 --> 01:21:46,234
It's not too late.

1239
01:22:16,682 --> 01:22:17,807
May I propose a toast?

1240
01:22:17,891 --> 01:22:18,975
Please.

1241
01:22:21,687 --> 01:22:25,148
To the beginning of the world.

1242
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:30,820
It's a good one, that.

1243
01:22:30,904 --> 01:22:32,030
Such a good cheap wine.

1244
01:23:56,782 --> 01:23:59,200
You are the love of my life.

1245
01:26:07,496 --> 01:26:09,080
Elsa, what are you doing here?

1246
01:26:09,706 --> 01:26:11,415
It is Thursday.

1247
01:26:14,086 --> 01:26:17,338
Are you
shitting me, Elsa? Seriously?

1248
01:26:18,173 --> 01:26:23,135
Go home. Just be with your family,
or do anything else.

1249
01:26:23,887 --> 01:26:26,848
I'm serious.
You... Leave. Please.

1250
01:26:33,063 --> 01:26:36,899
It's just that...
You don't... It's not...

1251
01:26:38,068 --> 01:26:41,779
I'm sorry.
I just... I'm not trying...

1252
01:26:44,241 --> 01:26:45,616
Never mind.

1253
01:26:48,203 --> 01:26:50,288
See you next week, Mr. Dodge?

1254
01:26:52,291 --> 01:26:53,332
Okay.

1255
01:26:54,751 --> 01:26:56,961
Bye, Elsa.

1256
01:27:01,967 --> 01:27:03,259
More Windose!

1257
01:27:05,053 --> 01:27:06,470
More Windose.

1258
01:27:11,268 --> 01:27:14,729
Matilda will be arriving
one week ahead of schedule.

1259
01:27:14,813 --> 01:27:18,232
The point of contact
is 16 hours, 26 minutes away,

1260
01:27:18,317 --> 01:27:19,901
so be sure to
mark your calendars.

1261
01:27:20,402 --> 01:27:21,569
Also, a friendly reminder

1262
01:27:21,653 --> 01:27:24,572
to set your clocks ahead
for daylight savings time.

1263
01:27:24,656 --> 01:27:26,908
Spring forward.
That's one hour ahead.

1264
01:27:28,327 --> 01:27:31,495
On a personal note,
this is my final broadcast.

1265
01:27:31,955 --> 01:27:33,664
Our final broadcast.

1266
01:27:34,333 --> 01:27:37,168
On behalf of myself,
producer Bruce Hammond,

1267
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:38,920
and everyone here
at the network,

1268
01:27:39,004 --> 01:27:40,922
we bid you all a fond farewell.

1269
01:27:41,632 --> 01:27:45,134
It has been my pleasure to bring
you the news for the past 27 years.

1270
01:27:46,136 --> 01:27:49,597
Tonight, I'll be sitting across the
dinner table from my wife, Helen,

1271
01:27:49,681 --> 01:27:53,017
and we'll be talking about
our sons, Henry and Paul.

1272
01:27:53,977 --> 01:27:57,146
And we'll be saying our prayers
for each and every one of you.

1273
01:27:58,148 --> 01:28:02,443
Good night, good luck,
and God bless.

1274
01:30:59,162 --> 01:31:00,955
Hey, what is it?

1275
01:31:05,168 --> 01:31:06,919
How could you let me go?

1276
01:31:09,005 --> 01:31:11,966
I don't know. It was so stupid.

1277
01:31:16,179 --> 01:31:17,805
I woke up.

1278
01:31:19,057 --> 01:31:21,058
I made him turn around.

1279
01:31:26,898 --> 01:31:29,525
I don't want to
fall asleep, okay?

1280
01:31:31,319 --> 01:31:32,653
Don't let me fall asleep.
Promise.

1281
01:31:32,737 --> 01:31:33,988
I promise.

1282
01:31:36,741 --> 01:31:38,242
What about your parents?

1283
01:31:39,161 --> 01:31:41,745
They're romantics,
they understand.

1284
01:31:42,539 --> 01:31:44,582
Besides,
they've got each other.

1285
01:31:46,001 --> 01:31:48,210
I just want to be with you.

1286
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:50,963
And I want to be with you.

1287
01:31:53,091 --> 01:31:56,594
I couldn't live without you.
No matter how long.

1288
01:32:02,058 --> 01:32:03,767
What do we do now?

1289
01:32:05,604 --> 01:32:09,315
I just want to lay here with you.
Just want to talk to you.

1290
01:32:13,904 --> 01:32:15,272
What are we gonna talk about?

1291
01:32:17,616 --> 01:32:19,450
Where'd you grow up?

1292
01:32:20,368 --> 01:32:22,995
Well, I was born in Surrey.

1293
01:32:23,079 --> 01:32:24,163
I know.

1294
01:32:24,247 --> 01:32:25,706
My whole family are from there.

1295
01:32:27,792 --> 01:32:30,211
My mum was a journalist
before she married my dad.

1296
01:32:30,295 --> 01:32:33,797
They never fought.
Or at least we never heard them fight.

1297
01:32:34,966 --> 01:32:38,010
Charlie's the oldest,
then Benny, then me.

1298
01:32:39,221 --> 01:32:41,472
We had a sister, but she
died when she was born.

1299
01:32:41,973 --> 01:32:43,515
I still think about her.

1300
01:32:45,343 --> 01:32:46,143
Oh, God!

1301
01:32:46,394 --> 01:32:49,521
What was her name?
What was your sister's name?

1302
01:32:50,190 --> 01:32:52,024
Patricia.

1303
01:32:52,234 --> 01:32:54,068
Patricia Hope Lockhart.

1304
01:32:54,152 --> 01:32:56,487
That's beautiful.
That's a beautiful name.

1305
01:32:56,571 --> 01:32:59,156
I wish I'd met you
a long time ago.

1306
01:33:00,242 --> 01:33:01,700
When we were kids.

1307
01:33:01,785 --> 01:33:05,246
It couldn't have happened any other way.
It had to happen now.

1308
01:33:06,748 --> 01:33:08,666
But it isn't enough time.

1309
01:33:10,085 --> 01:33:11,835
It never would have been.

1310
01:33:14,839 --> 01:33:16,423
- I'm scared.
- I...

1311
01:33:16,967 --> 01:33:19,677
Am madly in love
with you, Penny.

1312
01:33:20,345 --> 01:33:22,972
You're my favorite,
favorite thing.

1313
01:33:24,849 --> 01:33:27,851
I thought that somehow
we'd save each other.

1314
01:33:29,479 --> 01:33:30,938
We did.

1315
01:33:33,608 --> 01:33:35,025
Penny...

1316
01:33:37,028 --> 01:33:39,446
I'm really glad
I got to know you.
