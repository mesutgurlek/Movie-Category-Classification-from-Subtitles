1
00:00:55,888 --> 00:00:57,875
<i>Antarctica.</i>

2
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:01,512
<i>An inhospitable wasteland.</i>

3
00:01:01,612 --> 00:01:05,315
<i>But even here,
on the Earth's frozen bottom,</i>

4
00:01:05,415 --> 00:01:07,856
<i>we find life.</i>

5
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,658
<i>And not just any life.</i>

6
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,332
<i>Penguins.</i>

7
00:01:22,532 --> 00:01:25,234
<i>Joyous, frolicking, waddling,</i>

8
00:01:25,334 --> 00:01:28,237
<i>cute and cuddly life.</i>

9
00:01:29,394 --> 00:01:33,376
<i>Look at them tumbling
onto their chubby bum-bums.</i>

10
00:01:33,476 --> 00:01:36,213
<i>Who could take
these frisky little snow clowns...</i>

11
00:01:36,313 --> 00:01:40,316
Seriously? Does anyone even know
where we're marching to?

12
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:42,585
- Who cares?
- I question nothing.

13
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:43,752
- Me, too.
- Me, too.

14
00:01:43,852 --> 00:01:47,791
Well, fine! We'll just fly to the front
of the line and see for ourselves.

15
00:01:47,891 --> 00:01:51,628
Kowalski! Rico!
Engage aerial surveillance.

16
00:01:53,262 --> 00:01:57,387
Here we go! Doing it! Come on!
Skipper, we appear to be flightless.

17
00:01:57,487 --> 00:01:59,951
Well, what's the point of these?

18
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:07,088
Whoa! I like it!
Hey, this could be our thing!

19
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,216
What are we gonna call it?
Let's call it the... "high one."

20
00:02:14,011 --> 00:02:17,288
Hey! Anybody see that? That's an egg!
Is someone gonna go get it?

21
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:20,076
- We can't do that.
- Why not?

22
00:02:20,176 --> 00:02:23,960
Well, it's a dangerous world out there,
and we're just penguins.

23
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,296
You know, nothing but cute and cuddly.

24
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:29,900
Yeah. Why do you think there are always
documentary crews filming us?

25
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:36,840
Well, sorry, kid. You know, we lose
a few eggs every year. It's just nature.

26
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:41,344
Oh, right, nature.
I guess that makes sense, but...

27
00:02:41,444 --> 00:02:43,013
something...

28
00:02:43,113 --> 00:02:48,418
something deep down in my gut
tells me that it makes no sense at all.

29
00:02:48,818 --> 00:02:51,388
You know what? I reject nature!

30
00:02:53,323 --> 00:02:55,358
Who's with me?!

31
00:03:39,002 --> 00:03:42,305
The old ship. No one's ever
returned from there alive.

32
00:03:44,473 --> 00:03:48,944
Relax, Kowalski. There's a bird
down there now. Look, he's fine.

33
00:03:51,848 --> 00:03:56,653
- Leopard seals... nature's snakes.
- Aren't snakes nature's snakes?

34
00:03:56,753 --> 00:03:59,556
How should I know?
I live on the flipping frozen tundra.

35
00:04:01,524 --> 00:04:04,294
They're going for the egg!
Give me a way down there, ASAP!

36
00:04:04,394 --> 00:04:07,745
All one would have to do is collect
300 feet of kelp, dry it in the...

37
00:04:07,845 --> 00:04:12,602
Tiny and helpless, the baby penguins
are frozen with fear.

38
00:04:12,702 --> 00:04:17,540
They know if they fall from this cliff,
they will surely die.

39
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,209
Gunter, give them a shove.

40
00:04:20,807 --> 00:04:24,781
...harnessing the jellyfish we've trained
to obey simple voice commands.

41
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,886
Now, that's more like it!

42
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:44,135
That-a-boy, Rico! Don't let him have it!

43
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:48,585
Okay. I guess that works.

44
00:04:52,275 --> 00:04:53,716
Get to high ground!

45
00:05:00,016 --> 00:05:02,289
- Boo-yah!
- Success!

46
00:05:06,435 --> 00:05:08,992
- I'd recommend firing it now.
- Nope, hold on.

47
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:12,629
- We really should fire it.
- Not till we see the white of its eyes.

48
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,898
They're mostly pupil.
Very little white. Almost none!

49
00:05:14,998 --> 00:05:16,866
They got to have
a little bit of white, right?

50
00:05:16,966 --> 00:05:20,071
- None whatsoever.
- What if they look really far to the left?

51
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:23,932
Fire in the hole!

52
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:42,958
Kowalski, analysis?

53
00:05:43,326 --> 00:05:46,363
We are really awesome at this.

54
00:05:47,863 --> 00:05:51,000
Boys, we did it! Mission accomplished!

55
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,704
Hey, hey, we can do our thing. High one!

56
00:05:54,804 --> 00:05:56,006
Yes!

57
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,551
My bad.

58
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:08,867
Look. It's... it's the miracle of birth.

59
00:06:11,588 --> 00:06:14,091
A moment... of extraordinary beauty.

60
00:06:16,025 --> 00:06:20,231
Oh, that's disgusting! I think
I have amniotic sac in my mouth!

61
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,185
Whoa!

62
00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:30,185
Hello. Are you my family?

63
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:45,188
You don't have a family,
and we're all going to die. Sorry.

64
00:06:45,388 --> 00:06:46,789
What?

65
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:49,626
What? I thought that was
what we were all nodding about.

66
00:06:49,726 --> 00:06:52,936
No one's gonna die!
Know what you've got, kid?

67
00:06:53,036 --> 00:06:56,766
You've got us. We've got each other.

68
00:06:56,866 --> 00:06:59,907
And if that ain't a family,
I don't know what is.

69
00:07:04,307 --> 00:07:06,141
So adorable.

70
00:07:06,241 --> 00:07:08,578
Kowalski, what's our trajectory?

71
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:12,809
- 95% certain we're still doomed.
- And the other five percent?

72
00:07:12,909 --> 00:07:16,653
Adventure and glory like no penguins
have ever seen before.

73
00:07:16,753 --> 00:07:19,622
- I'll take that action.
- But where are we going?

74
00:07:19,922 --> 00:07:22,025
The future, boys.

75
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:24,264
Glorious future!

76
00:07:33,068 --> 00:07:36,939
That song! I swear it's gonna
make me lose my salmon.

77
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,908
Singing getting louder, Skipper!

78
00:07:39,008 --> 00:07:42,703
Then move faster!
Somebody get that wig off Private.

79
00:07:46,016 --> 00:07:50,420
- Kowalski, status report!
- I'm really getting tired of this song.

80
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:58,036
Well, the best part of owning a circus is you
can transport a cannon over state lines.

81
00:08:11,475 --> 00:08:15,907
Ten years ago on this very day,
a tiny egg hatched,

82
00:08:16,007 --> 00:08:20,274
and our world got a little bit cuter.
So tonight, Private,

83
00:08:20,474 --> 00:08:23,286
we celebrate your birthday

84
00:08:23,386 --> 00:08:28,439
by infiltrating the United States
gold depository at Fort Knox!

85
00:08:28,539 --> 00:08:29,933
- Splendid!
- What?

86
00:08:30,033 --> 00:08:31,980
There she is, boys.

87
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,897
The object of our unholy desire.
The butter on our biscuit.

88
00:08:35,997 --> 00:08:37,453
- The royal flush.
- Skipper?

89
00:08:37,553 --> 00:08:40,236
Private, what's our rule
about interrupting analogies?

90
00:08:40,336 --> 00:08:44,014
- Sorry. Please continue.
- The moment's gone. Private ruined it.

91
00:08:44,114 --> 00:08:46,509
Sir, we're approaching our target.

92
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:52,015
- But, Skipper, I really...
- Are you questioning my leadership, Private?

93
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:53,981
- No, sir.
- Too bad.

94
00:08:54,817 --> 00:08:58,655
- 'Cause I respect a soldier with some moxie.
- Really? Then I really think we should...

95
00:08:58,755 --> 00:09:02,692
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Dial back the moxie, sass-mouth.

96
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:06,568
Oh, look at you. Still so adorable.

97
00:09:08,163 --> 00:09:09,169
Fire in the hole!

98
00:09:14,403 --> 00:09:16,839
<i>8:00. Night-night time.</i>

99
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:18,196
Wha...?

100
00:09:21,911 --> 00:09:23,941
Private, come on!

101
00:09:31,387 --> 00:09:34,288
<i>- Please enter pass code.</i>
- Kowalski, you're up.

102
00:09:35,047 --> 00:09:39,510
- <i>Please enter pass code.</i>
- Rico, sonic incursion device.

103
00:09:42,365 --> 00:09:44,000
Oh, come on, you're kidding right?

104
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,604
Kentucky, Skipper.
They do love their Flatt and Scruggs.

105
00:09:47,804 --> 00:09:50,440
<i>Y'all come in now, y'hear?
Have yourself a iced tea.</i>

106
00:10:06,822 --> 00:10:08,861
Private, if you could have
anything you wanted

107
00:10:08,961 --> 00:10:12,240
in the whole wide world,
what would it be?

108
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:16,746
Well, gee, Skipper, I think to be a meaningful
and valued member of this team.

109
00:10:16,846 --> 00:10:18,852
Well, we got you something else.

110
00:10:21,838 --> 00:10:25,008
- A vending machine?
- Well, not just any vending machine, Private.

111
00:10:25,108 --> 00:10:29,923
The last remaining home in America's
nanny state for those succulent

112
00:10:30,023 --> 00:10:33,817
but chemically hazardous
bits of puffed heaven called...

113
00:10:34,617 --> 00:10:36,486
Cheezy Dibbles!

114
00:10:36,586 --> 00:10:40,355
Happy ding-dong birthday,
you little scamp!

115
00:10:41,111 --> 00:10:42,425
Thank you!

116
00:10:49,432 --> 00:10:51,701
You mess with the bull,
you're gonna get the horns, Private.

117
00:10:51,801 --> 00:10:54,424
Now, hit that machine
and get your present.

118
00:10:57,974 --> 00:11:02,438
We just broke into the most secure
facility in North America.

119
00:11:02,538 --> 00:11:03,751
You know what that means?

120
00:11:03,851 --> 00:11:06,583
We're wanted criminals who'll be
on the lam the rest of our lives,

121
00:11:06,683 --> 00:11:08,918
always feeling the hot breath
of Johnny Law on our necks?

122
00:11:09,018 --> 00:11:14,205
No! It means, as elite units go,
we're the elitest of the elite.

123
00:11:14,305 --> 00:11:18,697
Top shelf in the bureau.
The penultimate, plus one.

124
00:11:20,537 --> 00:11:21,898
Where'd Private go?

125
00:11:23,177 --> 00:11:24,967
Oh, there he is. D-3.

126
00:11:25,067 --> 00:11:28,938
- Oh, Private. How much is he?
- He's $3.50, sir.

127
00:11:29,038 --> 00:11:32,340
Well, that's outrageous.
Even for Private.

128
00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:35,151
Sir, the machine is alive!

129
00:11:36,312 --> 00:11:39,532
I don't think I like your attitude,
vending machine.

130
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:42,153
Or your prices! Release them!

131
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,230
What the...?

132
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:50,168
- Kowalski, analysis.
- All evidence indicates...

133
00:12:51,086 --> 00:12:53,555
I ate too many Cheezy Dibbles.

134
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:57,760
We're behind enemy lines
and incredibly thirsty.

135
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:01,266
Rico, bust us out
of this delicious prison.

136
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,023
Nice work, Rico.

137
00:13:06,002 --> 00:13:09,946
You are a meaningful
and valued member of this team.

138
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:28,657
Private, quit lollygagging.
And regular gagging.

139
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:34,364
Dark and ominous... Two of my least
favorite traits in a room.

140
00:13:34,464 --> 00:13:37,999
- Oh, look! A button.
- Private, don't!

141
00:13:40,503 --> 00:13:43,539
- Now, what have I told you about...
- Sorry, what?

142
00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:55,452
It looks like some sort of giant laser
sent to kill us all, sir.

143
00:13:57,853 --> 00:13:59,543
- Another one.
- No!

144
00:14:03,158 --> 00:14:05,061
- Wha...?
- Naughty, naughty.

145
00:14:07,963 --> 00:14:11,808
Pretty birds belong in their cages.

146
00:14:28,517 --> 00:14:33,455
Now, that's just hurtful.
And I was so happy to see you again.

147
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:38,260
Skipper, Kowalski, Rico...

148
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,166
and sweet little Private. Boop!

149
00:14:43,366 --> 00:14:44,667
Who are you?

150
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:48,170
The humans know me
as Dr. Octavius Brine.

151
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:52,375
Renowned geneticist, cheese enthusiast,

152
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:56,179
and frequent donor to NPR pledge drives.

153
00:14:56,679 --> 00:15:00,783
But you know me by a different,
much older name.

154
00:15:00,883 --> 00:15:05,120
A name perhaps you'd hoped
you'd never hear again.

155
00:15:05,368 --> 00:15:09,658
A phantom! A shadow of a former life!

156
00:15:10,058 --> 00:15:12,728
I... am...

157
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:14,660
Dave!

158
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,672
- Kowalski?
- Sorry, sir, no clue.

159
00:15:23,272 --> 00:15:24,954
Dave!

160
00:15:25,154 --> 00:15:27,588
- Dave!
- Dave!

161
00:15:27,688 --> 00:15:29,846
- Dave?
- Dave!

162
00:15:29,946 --> 00:15:32,251
- Dave.
- Dave!

163
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,055
Sorry.

164
00:15:41,155 --> 00:15:45,112
Wait. Wait. I... I live this way.

165
00:15:47,964 --> 00:15:52,270
- Go ahead, Dan, continue.
- You seriously don't remember me?

166
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:58,607
Dave! Dave! Right! Oh, yeah, long time.

167
00:15:58,955 --> 00:16:00,097
How's the wife?

168
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:03,412
I've never been married.

169
00:16:03,946 --> 00:16:08,952
You may not remember me,
but I could never forget you.

170
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:12,289
Let's shake up some old memories.

171
00:16:12,589 --> 00:16:15,125
New York City.

172
00:16:16,925 --> 00:16:18,727
<i>The Central Park Zoo.</i>

173
00:16:18,827 --> 00:16:20,884
<i>Life was good.</i>

174
00:16:21,329 --> 00:16:24,433
<i>Roomy tank, great location,</i>

175
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,144
<i>monkey-house views.</i>

176
00:16:28,037 --> 00:16:29,639
<i>And, of course...</i>

177
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:32,041
<i>my adoring legion of fans.</i>

178
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,243
- Cool.
<i>- Dave!</i>

179
00:16:34,343 --> 00:16:38,014
<i>The octopus of a thousand tricks.</i>

180
00:16:38,734 --> 00:16:42,084
- Awesome!
- <i>I was the total package.</i>

181
00:16:42,184 --> 00:16:43,519
- Wow.
- Hey, kids!

182
00:16:43,619 --> 00:16:45,821
You got to see this. Get up here quick!

183
00:16:46,321 --> 00:16:49,058
- Come on, kids. Come on...
- <i>And then you arrived.</i>

184
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,427
Oh, they're so adorable!

185
00:16:51,527 --> 00:16:54,597
Just smile and wave, boys.
Smile and wave.

186
00:16:54,697 --> 00:16:57,600
- <i>And took everything from me.</i>
- They're so cute!

187
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:01,838
- They're so adorable.
- Have you ever seen anything cuter?

188
00:17:03,038 --> 00:17:05,742
<i>Four adorable baby penguins.</i>

189
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:10,613
<i>With you around, no one wanted
an old octopus anymore.</i>

190
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,348
<i>"Out you go, Dave."</i>

191
00:17:14,148 --> 00:17:17,019
<i>And so it went, over and over,</i>

192
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,521
<i>- at zoo after aquarium.</i>
- Dad, look!

193
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,390
I can't see the penguins, man!

194
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:24,377
<i>Adorable penguins stole the show.</i>

195
00:17:29,498 --> 00:17:31,767
<i>While I was shunned.</i>

196
00:17:33,702 --> 00:17:35,247
<i>Forgotten.</i>

197
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,013
<i>Unwanted.</i>

198
00:17:44,513 --> 00:17:46,312
Alone.

199
00:17:49,752 --> 00:17:51,954
That sounds awful.

200
00:17:52,054 --> 00:17:54,523
Oh, it was.

201
00:17:54,623 --> 00:17:59,295
I came to realize some creatures
are born to get all the love.

202
00:17:59,595 --> 00:18:02,064
The rest of us get nothing!

203
00:18:02,364 --> 00:18:06,535
The only thing that has kept me going
all these years is my

204
00:18:06,635 --> 00:18:09,840
burning thirst for revenge!

205
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:15,309
And my precious souvenir
snow globe collection.

206
00:18:20,082 --> 00:18:23,018
What is wrong with you?!

207
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:27,923
Oh, Daryl, Daryl, Daryl, you can't
blame us for what happened to you.

208
00:18:28,934 --> 00:18:33,229
Can. That's how this whole
revenge thing works.

209
00:18:33,329 --> 00:18:38,451
And with this, I finally have
the power to destroy you.

210
00:18:38,601 --> 00:18:39,738
Crikey!

211
00:18:45,508 --> 00:18:47,876
Nicolas, cage them.

212
00:18:48,576 --> 00:18:51,213
I've got some bad news for you, Dennis.

213
00:18:51,313 --> 00:18:55,070
You messed with the wrong birds.
Because we are an elite unit,

214
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:58,687
the best of the best.
Cream of the corn on a platinum cob.

215
00:18:58,787 --> 00:19:03,849
And we're gonna take your deadly green goop
and sashay right out the exit hatch.

216
00:19:03,949 --> 00:19:06,896
And just how are you going to do that?

217
00:19:07,296 --> 00:19:09,498
Deploy secret weapon.

218
00:19:11,243 --> 00:19:14,970
- The cheese, it burns!
- Roll out.

219
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:22,390
After them!

220
00:19:26,281 --> 00:19:28,751
All right, boys, it's just like Cuba.

221
00:19:28,951 --> 00:19:30,683
Taxi!

222
00:19:35,491 --> 00:19:38,061
How about some music? Something chase-y.

223
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,432
Here they come.

224
00:19:44,032 --> 00:19:47,503
- Let's move.
- Stroke! Stroke! Stroke again!

225
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:50,039
Stroke some more! Stroke!

226
00:19:50,539 --> 00:19:54,443
Stroke! Stroke! Stroke!
Sorry! Stroke! Stroke!

227
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:07,305
- We got baddies, six o'clock.
- Kowalski, battle formation.

228
00:20:11,093 --> 00:20:15,831
So you squeegees want to do
the gondola mambo? Let's dance.

229
00:20:16,431 --> 00:20:19,134
Mother-of-pearl, that stings!
I've lost visual.

230
00:20:19,876 --> 00:20:22,538
- Kowalski, be my eyes.
- Left.

231
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,873
Right, right! Up!

232
00:20:25,073 --> 00:20:26,508
Duck.

233
00:20:28,635 --> 00:20:30,779
- I think I got 'em.
- They are down, sir.

234
00:20:30,879 --> 00:20:32,749
<i>Excelente.</i>

235
00:20:39,755 --> 00:20:41,156
- Skipper!
- They're back up.

236
00:20:41,256 --> 00:20:44,864
- And we are running out of canal.
- Parker Posey! Go all-terrain.

237
00:20:49,764 --> 00:20:51,038
Will you marry me?

238
00:20:57,139 --> 00:20:59,343
We've lost engine one!

239
00:21:01,643 --> 00:21:03,764
- And two and three.
- Four!

240
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,536
- Switch to emergency power.
- Aye, aye, Skipper.

241
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:18,171
We've got melons! Dead ahead!

242
00:21:28,671 --> 00:21:31,907
I can see. Rico, the glowy thing!

243
00:21:33,007 --> 00:21:35,216
Venetian blinded again!

244
00:21:39,848 --> 00:21:42,884
- We've been boarded.
- Initiate self-destruct sequence.

245
00:21:44,753 --> 00:21:46,933
- Nice.
- Whee!

246
00:21:47,356 --> 00:21:50,059
Frankly, I'm surprised we had
a self-destruct sequence.

247
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,268
All right, boys, battle stance.

248
00:22:00,368 --> 00:22:02,638
We're in battle stance, sir.

249
00:22:03,642 --> 00:22:07,511
Okay, good. Now we spring our trap.

250
00:22:09,611 --> 00:22:12,148
I'm not sure they're the ones
that are trapped, sir.

251
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:16,251
Kowalski, remember our little talk
about true but unhelpful comments?

252
00:22:16,351 --> 00:22:19,306
- Yes, sir.
- Sometimes we just have to wing it.

253
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:22,560
Wow.

254
00:22:35,784 --> 00:22:38,541
Sorry for underestimating
the plan, Skipper.

255
00:22:38,641 --> 00:22:42,076
It's okay, Kowalski.
Just don't ever doubt me again.

256
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,883
Now, what the heck is going on?!

257
00:22:48,683 --> 00:22:50,056
Remain calm, penguins.

258
00:22:50,874 --> 00:22:54,457
You are now under the protection
of the North Wind.

259
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:57,022
You're welcome.

260
00:23:03,835 --> 00:23:05,607
My gosh.

261
00:23:05,707 --> 00:23:10,616
You guys are so cute.
You guys are just so, so cute!

262
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,948
And cuddly.

263
00:23:13,342 --> 00:23:15,710
Hey, get away! No more hugs!

264
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:18,911
It's like being licked
by a basket full of puppy dogs.

265
00:23:19,011 --> 00:23:21,250
Corporal! Corporal!

266
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:23,687
Chart a course back
to North Wind headquarters.

267
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:28,490
Eva, inform them
that we're bringing in witnesses.

268
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,764
Private, Dibble me.

269
00:23:33,295 --> 00:23:35,925
We're not going anywhere with you.

270
00:23:36,025 --> 00:23:38,417
We don't even know who the heck you are.

271
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:41,569
The North Wind is an elite
undercover interspe...

272
00:23:43,105 --> 00:23:46,041
The North Wind is an elite under...

273
00:23:46,741 --> 00:23:49,249
An elite undercover interspecies...

274
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:53,649
...task... force, dedicated to help...

275
00:23:54,854 --> 00:23:56,414
helping...

276
00:23:57,252 --> 00:23:59,241
Dedicated to helping...

277
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:04,025
Dedi... Dedicated to helping animals
who can't help themselves.

278
00:24:05,327 --> 00:24:08,597
- Like penguins.
- Really? And you are?

279
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:12,768
- My name is classified.
- Classified? What is that, Dutch?

280
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,503
- Can't really hear the accent.
- Excuse me?

281
00:24:14,603 --> 00:24:17,272
- There's the accent.
- No, my name isn't Classified.

282
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:21,143
My name is classified because I am
the leader of this strike team.

283
00:24:21,243 --> 00:24:23,645
The seal is Short Fuse,
weapons and explosives.

284
00:24:23,745 --> 00:24:25,814
The bear is Corporal, he's our muscle.

285
00:24:25,914 --> 00:24:29,018
And the owl is Eva,
intelligence and analysis.

286
00:24:29,118 --> 00:24:33,456
Well, Agent Classified,
we happen to be an elite unit, too.

287
00:24:33,556 --> 00:24:35,624
<i>Self-destruct sequence activated.</i>

288
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:39,827
- You know, you should really label these things.
- <i>In three, two, one...</i>

289
00:24:39,929 --> 00:24:43,817
The name's Skipper. I run this outfit.
Back there is Kowalski.

290
00:24:43,917 --> 00:24:47,444
He's the brains of our operation.
Say something smart, Kowalski.

291
00:24:53,875 --> 00:24:56,579
See? He's working
on a whole 'nother level.

292
00:24:56,679 --> 00:24:59,681
And Rico, he's our demolition expert.

293
00:25:00,716 --> 00:25:05,054
He destroyed that chair for the
sheer fun of it. No reason at all.

294
00:25:05,154 --> 00:25:07,169
And then there's Private.

295
00:25:07,269 --> 00:25:13,729
He's... he's sort of our,
you know, secretary/mascot.

296
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:17,964
- Cute.
- And cuddly. Oh, sorry.

297
00:25:18,064 --> 00:25:20,702
Well, let's see how well
"cute and cuddly" handles this next bit.

298
00:25:32,213 --> 00:25:34,050
Nice doggy door.

299
00:25:41,056 --> 00:25:42,891
Wow.

300
00:25:43,547 --> 00:25:44,826
Look at this.

301
00:25:44,926 --> 00:25:49,498
Well, well, well. Not a bad place
you got here, Classified.

302
00:25:49,598 --> 00:25:51,567
Thank you. That's not my name.

303
00:25:51,667 --> 00:25:54,169
<i>Arrival at pad 17.</i>

304
00:25:54,569 --> 00:25:56,554
All right, tiny penguins,

305
00:25:56,654 --> 00:26:00,706
the best way for the North Wind to protect
helpless animals like yourselves

306
00:26:00,806 --> 00:26:03,627
is to bring Dr. Brine to justice.
Now, you were inside his sub,

307
00:26:03,727 --> 00:26:05,881
so I need to know everything you know.

308
00:26:10,084 --> 00:26:13,905
- Hey!
- Just tell me everything you know.

309
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:16,058
All right. Numero uno:

310
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,932
- Never trust a Dutchman in a tulip fight.
- Tulip fight...

311
00:26:19,032 --> 00:26:22,497
Canada is secretly training
an army of Sasquatch.

312
00:26:22,597 --> 00:26:26,768
Hot dogs are, in fact,
only 17 percent actual dog.

313
00:26:26,868 --> 00:26:29,289
Not "everything" everything. Just...

314
00:26:29,389 --> 00:26:33,042
everything regarding your abduction
by Dr. Octavius Brine.

315
00:26:34,475 --> 00:26:36,078
- Why didn't you say so?
- What?

316
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:41,717
My team has uncovered that Dr. Octavius Brine
is actually an individual known as Derek.

317
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,467
- Dave.
- As Dave the octopus.

318
00:26:44,567 --> 00:26:48,791
An octopus? No.
Dr. Brine is not an octopus. He is...

319
00:26:48,891 --> 00:26:53,929
An octopus. Precisely.
That's exactly what our intel indicated.

320
00:26:54,229 --> 00:26:55,305
Release the sheep.

321
00:26:58,833 --> 00:27:02,704
What you, of course, could not know
is that Dr. Brine's laboratory in Venice

322
00:27:02,804 --> 00:27:08,243
is secretly developing a doomsday weapon
called the "Medusa Serum."

323
00:27:08,843 --> 00:27:11,580
- But what you don't know is that Dirk...
- Dave.

324
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,733
- Dave won't be using his bazooka serum...
- Medusa Serum.

325
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:16,631
Medusa Serum on anybody.

326
00:27:16,731 --> 00:27:19,390
- That part is accurate.
- Show him, Rico.

327
00:27:23,757 --> 00:27:25,860
You stole the Medusa Serum?

328
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:31,101
Well, stole the serum, saved the day,
did your job for you. Call it what you will.

329
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,393
- Debbie!
- Dave.

330
00:27:34,493 --> 00:27:38,408
- Dave!
- He hacked into our system.

331
00:27:39,708 --> 00:27:41,383
Where's the sound?

332
00:27:41,483 --> 00:27:44,580
- Dave. Your microphone, it's not on.
- I can't... I can't hear anything.

333
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,481
Click on the button with
the picture of the microphone.

334
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:49,784
- Every time a villain calls in, this happens.
<i>- Hello? Hello?</i>

335
00:27:49,884 --> 00:27:53,054
- Now we can hear you, but we cannot see you.
- So annoying. Every time.

336
00:27:53,154 --> 00:27:55,724
- It's like talking to my parents.
<i>- How about now?</i>

337
00:27:55,824 --> 00:27:57,291
- Hurray!
- Great!

338
00:27:57,391 --> 00:28:00,695
- Yes, we've got you; that's fantastic.
<i>- Excellent. Now, where was I?</i>

339
00:28:01,361 --> 00:28:02,648
Dave!

340
00:28:03,365 --> 00:28:07,836
<i>Greetings, North Wind.
I see you've met my old zoo-mates.</i>

341
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:11,093
We were never mates.
There was no mating.

342
00:28:11,193 --> 00:28:14,498
Turn yourself in, David.
You're powerless now that I've stolen

343
00:28:14,598 --> 00:28:17,379
- your precious Medusa Serum.
- What? You? You didn't steal that.

344
00:28:17,479 --> 00:28:19,948
- It's over.
- <i>It's over?</i>

345
00:28:20,048 --> 00:28:23,585
<i>Then why did I call you?</i>

346
00:28:23,685 --> 00:28:28,190
<i>Weird. Oh, maybe it was
to show you this.</i>

347
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,559
That is a lot of serum
for four penguins.

348
00:28:31,859 --> 00:28:35,630
<i>Oh, you thought this was
just about you four?</i>

349
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:38,133
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no.</i>

350
00:28:38,233 --> 00:28:40,796
<i>We're just getting started.</i>

351
00:28:41,603 --> 00:28:46,508
<i>Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go do some shopping...</i>

352
00:28:46,608 --> 00:28:49,143
<i>for revenge!</i>

353
00:28:51,747 --> 00:28:54,114
<i>Wait, how do you...</i>

354
00:28:54,683 --> 00:28:58,580
<i>What do I push? Is it the red or...</i>

355
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,231
<i>I thought it was the... It's not this...</i>

356
00:29:04,192 --> 00:29:06,095
- Incoming alert.
- Put it on the screen.

357
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,498
The Berlin Zoo... 15 penguins missing.

358
00:29:09,598 --> 00:29:13,435
- Dave's kidnapping other penguins!
- No doubt cute and cuddly.

359
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,337
- We have to move! What?
- We have to move! What?

360
00:29:15,437 --> 00:29:16,972
- Time for our A-game.
- Everybody, huddle up.

361
00:29:17,272 --> 00:29:21,409
Corporal, ready the jet.
I'm initiating North Wind Protocol Zeta.

362
00:29:21,709 --> 00:29:23,612
12 more penguins taken from London Zoo.

363
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:29,282
Okay, boys, this is it. The mission
we've been preparing for our entire lives.

364
00:29:29,382 --> 00:29:32,120
We're gonna take down Dave
or die trying.

365
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,819
- Kowalski, cancel our improv class!
- Yes, sir.

366
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,324
- Rico, equipify.
- Hi!

367
00:29:35,424 --> 00:29:37,026
Private, do that little thing I like.

368
00:29:38,926 --> 00:29:41,329
- It's still funny.
- Skipper, good news.

369
00:29:41,429 --> 00:29:44,933
- I got them to credit our class.
- Sir, the jet is ready.

370
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:47,696
Oh, yeah, baby! Just like Super Bowl 19!

371
00:29:47,796 --> 00:29:49,153
They're stealing my stuff!

372
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:53,641
No! This mission has no place for a pathetic
waddle of useless penguins!

373
00:29:53,741 --> 00:29:55,927
- Who are you calling pathetic?
- Enough!

374
00:29:58,847 --> 00:30:02,150
See, Rico, that's why you can't
have nice things.

375
00:30:03,686 --> 00:30:08,222
You know, I'm pretty good
with computers myself.

376
00:30:16,964 --> 00:30:20,000
Put on your jammies, penguin.

377
00:30:21,124 --> 00:30:23,972
- They are even cute when they're asleep.
- Not to me.

378
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:28,843
I want these butterballs out of
my way and out of my mission.

379
00:30:28,943 --> 00:30:33,619
Ship them to one of our safe houses.
The most remote place on the planet.

380
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:43,892
- Where the heck are we?
- Oxygen content is low.

381
00:30:43,992 --> 00:30:46,427
I suggest we limit our breathing.

382
00:30:48,129 --> 00:30:49,698
Private!

383
00:30:52,099 --> 00:30:54,186
Sorry! I get gassy when I fly.

384
00:30:54,286 --> 00:30:57,372
- Toot sweet! He does.
- We must be on a plane.

385
00:30:59,306 --> 00:31:02,031
What did North Wind do to us?

386
00:31:02,131 --> 00:31:04,178
They gave us badges.

387
00:31:04,678 --> 00:31:07,925
Not badges, tranquilizer darts.

388
00:31:08,025 --> 00:31:09,651
Classified!

389
00:31:09,751 --> 00:31:12,888
That low-down dirty dog
is trying kick us off the mission.

390
00:31:12,988 --> 00:31:17,075
He thinks we can't save the penguins
because we're just "penguins."

391
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:20,695
Well, penguins are our flesh
and feathers. They're us.

392
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:23,899
And if anyone's gonna save us, it's us.

393
00:31:23,999 --> 00:31:26,769
But, Skipper,
we've got to be five miles up.

394
00:31:26,869 --> 00:31:31,262
- That pretty much limits our options.
- I make my own options.

395
00:31:37,078 --> 00:31:40,848
Brilliant move, Skipper, but now
we seem to be outside the plane.

396
00:31:40,948 --> 00:31:45,254
Well, kind of got caught up in the moment.
Well, hindsight's 20/20.

397
00:31:45,354 --> 00:31:49,290
Okay, Kowalski,
your turn to pick up the slack.

398
00:31:49,524 --> 00:31:52,126
Oh, why don't we catch that plane?

399
00:31:53,627 --> 00:31:55,779
Bird strike, log it.

400
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:59,034
We've got another target at 12 o'clock.

401
00:31:59,134 --> 00:32:04,339
Good, it's only 11:30. Follow me, boys!
We're going in hot.

402
00:32:06,975 --> 00:32:10,846
- No one likes a show-off, Private.
- Aim for first class!

403
00:32:16,015 --> 00:32:17,052
I'm okay!

404
00:32:17,767 --> 00:32:19,855
Kowalski, where does this aircraft go?

405
00:32:19,955 --> 00:32:23,324
From the odd shape of this bagel,
I'd say we're headed for Paris.

406
00:32:23,424 --> 00:32:26,227
France? Forget it!
Not with their tax laws!

407
00:32:26,327 --> 00:32:29,128
- Then I would suggest a mid-air transfer.
- Affirmative.

408
00:32:29,228 --> 00:32:31,266
Peanuts! Peanuts! Peanuts, peanut, peanut,
peanut, peanut, peanut, peanut!

409
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:34,306
- We're out of peanuts, Skipper!
- Try pretzels, Private.

410
00:32:35,904 --> 00:32:37,152
Bingo.

411
00:32:37,252 --> 00:32:38,875
There's our ride, boys.

412
00:32:38,975 --> 00:32:43,137
Can't stay, doll. Danger is my mistress.

413
00:32:43,441 --> 00:32:45,253
Rico, more height.

414
00:32:45,353 --> 00:32:48,424
Pretzels! Pretzels! Pretzel,
pretzel, pretzels! We're out of pretzels!

415
00:32:48,524 --> 00:32:52,019
Yeah? Then we're leaving just time,
'cause these folks are gonna freak!

416
00:32:52,144 --> 00:32:53,889
Deploy flaps.

417
00:32:55,089 --> 00:32:56,919
Stay on target!

418
00:32:57,892 --> 00:33:00,261
We're gonna catch it,
we're gonna catch it!

419
00:33:01,061 --> 00:33:02,874
Crikey! We're not gonna catch it!

420
00:33:02,974 --> 00:33:05,487
Wait a minute, where's Skipper?

421
00:33:07,011 --> 00:33:10,739
Time to get creative.
Start grabbing boxes, boys.

422
00:33:11,305 --> 00:33:13,041
Going long!

423
00:33:15,209 --> 00:33:19,813
Oh, Private, stop playing with
those backpacks. Find something useful.

424
00:33:20,882 --> 00:33:23,552
Now we're talking. Let's get to work.

425
00:33:23,652 --> 00:33:25,253
400 meters.

426
00:33:25,353 --> 00:33:28,456
- 300 meters!
- Speak American, Kowalski!

427
00:33:28,556 --> 00:33:31,868
Sorry, sir. 218 yards. 109 yards.

428
00:33:40,868 --> 00:33:43,973
Okay, then.
It's clear what we need to do next.

429
00:33:50,144 --> 00:33:51,213
That feels right.

430
00:33:52,003 --> 00:33:56,183
Impressive bouncing, boys.
Now, then, back to civilization.

431
00:33:56,283 --> 00:34:01,122
If we're gonna take Dexter down, we need
to know where he's gonna strike next.

432
00:34:11,867 --> 00:34:13,235
Yeah!

433
00:34:13,335 --> 00:34:15,214
Goal!

434
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,783
Elijah, would you please take them away.

435
00:34:34,255 --> 00:34:37,625
Penguin footprints, still warm.
We just missed Dave.

436
00:34:38,051 --> 00:34:42,363
- Blast it, he's gone.
- So many penguins!

437
00:34:44,064 --> 00:34:46,187
- Boss! He's stress-eating again!
- Corporal?

438
00:34:46,287 --> 00:34:49,070
- There, there.
- Rub the angry out of the tummy.

439
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,840
Corporal? Fo... focus.

440
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:56,177
We are going to save
those helpless penguins, because...

441
00:34:56,277 --> 00:35:00,048
we are the North Wind, and no one...

442
00:35:00,148 --> 00:35:03,553
no one breaks the Wind.

443
00:35:04,753 --> 00:35:07,021
No one breaks the Wind.

444
00:35:07,321 --> 00:35:11,779
There's a good Corporal. Now, we rescued
those four penguins already, didn't we?

445
00:35:11,879 --> 00:35:15,597
Shipped them off all cozy and snug to a
Madagascar... How come there's beeping?

446
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:19,804
Sir, those penguins...
They never made it to Madagascar.

447
00:35:20,534 --> 00:35:23,242
What? Well, where the dickens are they?

448
00:35:27,642 --> 00:35:29,510
Kowalski, what are our coordinates?

449
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:33,948
From my calculations, we've arrived
in the center of Dublin, Ireland.

450
00:35:36,985 --> 00:35:41,055
All right, soldiers, we got to blend in.
Riverdance.

451
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,196
No time to kiss the Blarney stone, boys.

452
00:35:49,296 --> 00:35:53,070
We need to find intel
on Dave's location, pronto.

453
00:35:58,572 --> 00:36:01,676
All right, you, where's Dave!
Give us the goods. Spit it out!

454
00:36:01,776 --> 00:36:06,148
- Don't make me use shillelagh!
- Sir, that's... That's a baby squid.

455
00:36:10,151 --> 00:36:11,919
Sorry, laddie.

456
00:36:12,854 --> 00:36:16,491
Stranded on the Emerald Isle
without a single clue.

457
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:20,053
- Well, so much for the luck o' the Irish.
- Skipper, look!

458
00:36:24,331 --> 00:36:27,035
Begorrah! Does anyone speak Gaelic?

459
00:36:27,135 --> 00:36:29,587
No. But it looks like Dave's been busy.

460
00:36:29,697 --> 00:36:32,240
He's stolen penguins from Guadalajara!

461
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:34,042
- Madrid!
- Paris!

462
00:36:34,342 --> 00:36:36,903
- Athens!
- Bangalore!

463
00:36:37,545 --> 00:36:39,266
- Dusseldorf!
- Osaka!

464
00:36:39,366 --> 00:36:41,250
- Rio de Janeiro!
- Nairobi!

465
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:43,751
- Amsterdam!
- Baton Rouge!

466
00:36:44,151 --> 00:36:46,420
Dave's snow globe collection.

467
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:49,991
It's every zoo and aquarium
he got kicked out of!

468
00:36:50,091 --> 00:36:54,795
Don't tell me where he has been,
tell me where he will have has been next.

469
00:36:55,061 --> 00:36:58,466
Wait, what is it, Rico?
It's a book! It's a film! It's a play!

470
00:36:58,666 --> 00:37:01,835
First word. Two syllables.
Sounds like...

471
00:37:02,737 --> 00:37:06,979
Sounds like "huuh"? Sounds like "hyech!"
What starts with "hyech"?

472
00:37:12,579 --> 00:37:14,249
Shanghai.

473
00:37:14,949 --> 00:37:18,920
Dave hasn't been there yet, Skipper.
If we hurry, we can still stop him.

474
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,655
Nice work, Rico.

475
00:37:20,755 --> 00:37:24,966
Pack your bagpipes, boys.
It's time to blow this potato stand.

476
00:37:39,307 --> 00:37:44,169
So this is it. Shanghai's famous
Little Dublin district.

477
00:37:44,269 --> 00:37:47,381
- Skipper, look!
- I see you, Private.

478
00:37:47,481 --> 00:37:49,951
Who's the big boy
standing on his tippy-toes?

479
00:37:50,051 --> 00:37:52,253
- Wha...? No, I mean...
- I just want to eat you up.

480
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:55,654
Skipper, look! Above Private!
Dave's next target...

481
00:37:55,754 --> 00:37:58,118
Shanghai's famous mermaid penguins.

482
00:37:58,218 --> 00:38:00,562
Good eye, Kowalski. And once again,

483
00:38:00,662 --> 00:38:04,365
you've proved that you are a meaningful
and valued member of this team.

484
00:38:07,009 --> 00:38:11,406
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, Shanghai
Marine World is pleased to present</i>

485
00:38:11,506 --> 00:38:15,208
<i>our world-famous Mermaid Penguins!</i>

486
00:38:16,745 --> 00:38:19,686
<i>Tonight, our mermaids
dedicate their performance</i>

487
00:38:19,786 --> 00:38:23,084
<i>to all the missing penguins
around the world.</i>

488
00:38:23,184 --> 00:38:25,853
<i>Stay safe, little guys,
wherever you are.</i>

489
00:38:25,953 --> 00:38:29,224
<i>And we hope you come home real soon.</i>

490
00:38:33,866 --> 00:38:38,065
Keep those eyes roving, boys.
Dave is a master of disguise.

491
00:38:38,165 --> 00:38:42,670
He could be a small child,
a house plant, maybe even you or me!

492
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:46,191
- Is it you, Kowalski?
- Hey, hold on.

493
00:38:50,845 --> 00:38:51,749
Wait a minute.

494
00:38:54,649 --> 00:38:59,354
Bingo! Nice try, Dave!
Operation Flash, Splash and Crash is a go!

495
00:38:59,454 --> 00:39:01,656
- Splendid!
- Take positions.

496
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:05,396
<i>Penguin feeding time
will begin in two minutes.</i>

497
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:15,804
Target, 30 yards and closing.

498
00:39:17,004 --> 00:39:19,187
In position, Skipper.

499
00:39:19,606 --> 00:39:22,543
- <i>Rico, report.</i>
- In position.

500
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,446
- For you, Private.
- Yes, Skipper!

501
00:39:24,546 --> 00:39:26,748
- Here's your mermaid costume.
- What?

502
00:39:26,848 --> 00:39:31,184
We need a diversion. And, frankly,
you're the only one who can pull off that look.

503
00:39:31,284 --> 00:39:34,272
But I can do more, Skipper.
I want to help the team.

504
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:38,860
Really help the team.
If you think I'm ready, which I am.

505
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,331
Assuming you agree.
And perhaps even... if you don't?

506
00:39:44,431 --> 00:39:48,761
I like the moxie, soldier, but right now,
I need a tail on that tush

507
00:39:48,861 --> 00:39:53,196
and the cutest smile you've got.
You trust me, soldier?

508
00:39:55,942 --> 00:39:57,478
Aye, aye, Skipper.

509
00:39:57,978 --> 00:39:59,453
Hey, it's feeding time!

510
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:04,284
Target, ten yards from flashpoint.

511
00:40:04,418 --> 00:40:06,255
Private, you're up.

512
00:40:07,455 --> 00:40:09,890
You just mermaid my day.

513
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:11,890
Flash is a go!

514
00:40:12,492 --> 00:40:14,328
Look, they let one of the mermaids
out of the tank!

515
00:40:14,428 --> 00:40:16,984
- Oh, she's so cute.
- It's the cutest thing I've ever seen.

516
00:40:17,784 --> 00:40:19,595
Shields up!

517
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:26,648
Target is stunned.
Rico, bring the Splash.

518
00:40:43,157 --> 00:40:44,525
Yeah!

519
00:40:53,267 --> 00:40:57,809
Oh, what are you doing out here, cutie?
Come on. Back in your tank.

520
00:41:00,808 --> 00:41:02,513
Secure the mermaids and find me...

521
00:41:05,313 --> 00:41:06,783
David the octopus.

522
00:41:09,483 --> 00:41:11,719
A little late, North Wind.

523
00:41:14,273 --> 00:41:17,671
Mission accomplished. High one!

524
00:41:18,326 --> 00:41:22,663
Corporal, take our prisoner...
the one that belongs to us... into custody.

525
00:41:23,167 --> 00:41:26,470
- What?
- You melted him?! You birds are sick!

526
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:31,082
He's going in through the pipes!

527
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:36,873
Skipper!

528
00:41:36,973 --> 00:41:40,781
Private? Private!
You got to get out of there!

529
00:41:41,565 --> 00:41:44,677
- No, no, no. No, no, no, no. Private!
- Skipper!

530
00:41:45,619 --> 00:41:46,954
Private!

531
00:41:47,054 --> 00:41:48,322
- Help!
- No!

532
00:41:49,419 --> 00:41:51,258
Okay. Here we go.

533
00:41:51,758 --> 00:41:53,315
Move, move, move!

534
00:41:56,765 --> 00:42:00,000
He's got Private! He's getting away.
He's getting away!

535
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:03,671
- Skipper, the North Wind's plane.
- Sweet chariot of the gods!

536
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:07,245
- But can you fly it, man?
- There's only one way to find out.

537
00:42:11,645 --> 00:42:14,785
No, I... still can't read.

538
00:42:14,885 --> 00:42:16,584
Then we're going off-book.

539
00:42:24,858 --> 00:42:26,297
No! No, no, no, no!

540
00:42:28,961 --> 00:42:31,528
Too much, too much, too much,
too much, too much!

541
00:42:38,272 --> 00:42:41,476
- I'm getting the hang of this, Skipper.
- Pull off!

542
00:42:41,576 --> 00:42:43,947
Good! We're coming for you, Private!

543
00:42:45,947 --> 00:42:49,917
Those ludicrous butterballs
are letting David escape!

544
00:42:50,017 --> 00:42:53,251
Eva, secure transport.
Short Fuse, Corporal, hitch us a ride.

545
00:42:59,627 --> 00:43:00,863
Fire!

546
00:43:04,231 --> 00:43:05,880
Go fetch.

547
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,749
Hold her steady.

548
00:43:31,625 --> 00:43:33,994
Sir, Dave is pulling ahead.
We are too heavy.

549
00:43:34,094 --> 00:43:39,299
Oh, curse our heavily cheese-dibbled diet!
Rico, give me a West Helsinki fire sale.

550
00:43:39,399 --> 00:43:41,804
- Yeah, yeah.
- Everything must go!

551
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:47,633
What the...

552
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:52,746
- That's everything, sir.
- Have you purged the chemical toilet?

553
00:43:52,846 --> 00:43:56,903
- But Rico was in there for 15 minutes!
- Just do it!

554
00:44:05,326 --> 00:44:07,361
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

555
00:44:11,665 --> 00:44:14,501
<i>- Self-destruct sequence in five,</i>
- No, Private!

556
00:44:14,601 --> 00:44:18,796
- <i>four, three, two...</i>
- Stay strong soldier!

557
00:44:18,896 --> 00:44:20,182
<i>...one.</i>

558
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:39,528
Skipper's log.

559
00:44:39,827 --> 00:44:43,397
Private has been kidnapped by Dave,

560
00:44:44,153 --> 00:44:48,468
while we have been cast adrift
for what seems like days.

561
00:44:48,568 --> 00:44:51,538
No rations, fresh water...

562
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:54,236
or land in sight.

563
00:44:56,778 --> 00:44:59,276
Kowalski is sick as a dog.

564
00:45:00,147 --> 00:45:02,815
And Rico keeps trying to eat him.

565
00:45:02,915 --> 00:45:05,585
Just, please, just cut it out.

566
00:45:07,521 --> 00:45:10,858
Not sure how long we can hold on.

567
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:14,394
This may be my final entry.

568
00:45:15,676 --> 00:45:19,145
2004 Grand Cru.
Hints of pear, white peaches.

569
00:45:19,245 --> 00:45:21,882
- The salmon is delicious.
- Oh, I have never been...

570
00:45:21,982 --> 00:45:26,248
- ...more hydrated in my life.
- Let me cut you a piece of the salmon.

571
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:28,676
- No, thank you. I'm stuffed.
- It's the most delicious thing on the boat.

572
00:45:28,776 --> 00:45:33,082
- I have to loosen my utility belt.
- No, I'm full. Just dump it in the ocean.

573
00:45:34,682 --> 00:45:37,851
You know, we're all
in the same boat here.

574
00:45:38,251 --> 00:45:42,356
Actually, we're not. And perhaps
you could express a little more concern

575
00:45:42,456 --> 00:45:47,293
over the fact that you stole
and destroyed a $19 million vehicle!

576
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:49,096
Bill me.

577
00:45:49,896 --> 00:45:54,035
- Corporal? Corporal?
- We're picking up a signal, sir.

578
00:45:54,666 --> 00:45:57,415
It's five klicks southwest,

579
00:45:57,515 --> 00:46:00,019
but it stopped at that remote island.

580
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:01,682
Land?

581
00:46:03,211 --> 00:46:05,713
Good on you.
You've tracked down some land.

582
00:46:05,813 --> 00:46:10,285
No, silly willy. We've been tracking
your little secretary/mascot.

583
00:46:10,385 --> 00:46:12,720
What? You put
a homing device on Private?

584
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:16,090
All of you, actually, when I darted you.

585
00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:18,559
You low-down,

586
00:46:18,659 --> 00:46:21,963
dirty, mangy, filthy,

587
00:46:22,063 --> 00:46:26,001
flea-bitten, bum-sniffing
toilet drinker!

588
00:46:27,601 --> 00:46:30,271
But... good.

589
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:32,639
See, I told you.

590
00:46:32,739 --> 00:46:35,942
You should've left this
to the professionals.

591
00:47:12,145 --> 00:47:13,981
892.

592
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:17,639
893. 894.

593
00:47:17,739 --> 00:47:19,520
895.

594
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:21,822
Ahoy there!

595
00:47:22,897 --> 00:47:25,420
Penguins.

596
00:47:27,561 --> 00:47:31,464
I bet you're all just dying to know
why I brought you here.

597
00:47:31,564 --> 00:47:36,336
- He's gonna kill us all!
- What? No.

598
00:47:37,204 --> 00:47:40,240
My Medusa Serum doesn't kill anyone.

599
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:44,111
- Where's the fun in that?
- So, what does it do?

600
00:47:44,711 --> 00:47:47,842
Something much, much worse.

601
00:47:49,716 --> 00:47:53,008
Right. But, like, what specifically?

602
00:47:53,708 --> 00:47:57,674
Well, that's exactly
what I came up here to show you.

603
00:47:57,774 --> 00:47:59,561
All I need is a test subject.

604
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:02,196
Hello, little buggy-boo!

605
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:04,288
Is this about the chirping?
'Cause I could... Whoa!

606
00:48:04,865 --> 00:48:05,931
Whoa!

607
00:48:06,031 --> 00:48:09,699
Behold, as I unleash the full power

608
00:48:09,799 --> 00:48:13,657
of the Medusa Serum.

609
00:48:14,552 --> 00:48:15,645
Fire!

610
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:23,966
Yes! It works!

611
00:48:26,186 --> 00:48:30,857
I made a monster. I made a monster!

612
00:48:30,957 --> 00:48:33,951
And all you adorable penguins are next!

613
00:48:34,051 --> 00:48:35,729
Crikey!

614
00:48:36,429 --> 00:48:37,600
Who said that?

615
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,669
No.

616
00:48:41,769 --> 00:48:44,140
No. No.

617
00:48:48,076 --> 00:48:49,843
Yes!

618
00:48:49,943 --> 00:48:52,847
Gentlemen, you remember Private.

619
00:48:52,947 --> 00:48:54,548
Oh, hey.

620
00:48:54,648 --> 00:48:57,084
You'll never get away with this, Dave.

621
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:58,519
My brothers are coming,

622
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:02,450
and together we'll take a wrecking ball
to your whole rotten operation.

623
00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:05,092
Call off the hunt, everyone.

624
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:10,864
Turns out the elite unit
will be coming to us.

625
00:49:11,264 --> 00:49:12,830
Boop.

626
00:49:20,057 --> 00:49:21,576
<i>Eva?</i>

627
00:49:21,876 --> 00:49:23,678
<i>What do you see?</i>

628
00:49:23,778 --> 00:49:26,614
My count is 30 hostiles.

629
00:49:27,416 --> 00:49:29,543
31.

630
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:33,520
Those two are very close together.

631
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:36,290
I mean, you know, intertwined,

632
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:39,093
physically, but... but not in...

633
00:49:39,793 --> 00:49:41,661
Ixnay on the irtflay, Kowalski.

634
00:49:42,595 --> 00:49:45,337
Poor Private. Alone,

635
00:49:45,437 --> 00:49:48,002
helpless in the belly of that beast.

636
00:49:48,102 --> 00:49:50,837
We've faced some
long odds before, Skipper,

637
00:49:50,937 --> 00:49:54,908
but these look like
the longest and oddest.

638
00:49:55,008 --> 00:49:58,418
If we're gonna pull this off,
we'll need a diversion.

639
00:49:58,518 --> 00:50:00,978
<i>Deactivating jungle camouflage.</i>

640
00:50:01,078 --> 00:50:03,111
- Would you be quiet?
- Listen, Classified...

641
00:50:03,211 --> 00:50:06,187
Short Fuse, you were supposed
to handcuff them to the rock!

642
00:50:06,287 --> 00:50:09,022
- Don't you hologram me!
- I tried, but they don't have hands.

643
00:50:09,122 --> 00:50:13,766
They just have flippers, boss. And I
have flippers! So it's flipping useless!

644
00:50:14,127 --> 00:50:17,397
All right, pooch.
If you won't work with us,

645
00:50:17,497 --> 00:50:21,101
you better work for us.
Our plan requires a diversion.

646
00:50:21,301 --> 00:50:23,726
I give the orders around here.
Much as it pains me,

647
00:50:23,826 --> 00:50:27,575
I need you to act as our diversion
for our operation, understood?

648
00:50:27,675 --> 00:50:31,477
Nope! This is our plan,
and it requires you to cause a diversion.

649
00:50:31,577 --> 00:50:32,546
- Die-version.
- Dih-version.

650
00:50:32,646 --> 00:50:36,374
- Die, die, die, die, die, die!
- Dih, dih, dih, dih, dih, dih!

651
00:50:36,474 --> 00:50:39,986
Gentlemen, there is only
one way to resolve this.

652
00:50:40,086 --> 00:50:41,789
- We should kiss.
- Plan-off.

653
00:50:41,889 --> 00:50:45,626
Yep, plan-off.
That's what I was gonna say.

654
00:50:46,507 --> 00:50:47,675
Plan-off.

655
00:50:49,962 --> 00:50:51,434
Here's Dave's sub.

656
00:50:52,432 --> 00:50:55,378
And this young, helpless,

657
00:50:55,478 --> 00:50:57,505
vulnerable rock is Private.

658
00:50:57,605 --> 00:50:59,173
And here's Dave.

659
00:51:00,473 --> 00:51:03,810
While you four blowhards
"dih-vert" the octopi,

660
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:06,246
we strike fast and strike hard!

661
00:51:06,446 --> 00:51:08,982
Hi-yah! Get on in here, boys!

662
00:51:09,082 --> 00:51:12,820
Slap him silly, Rico! Come on!
Kowalski, free the hostages!

663
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:16,457
Now, that's what I'm talking about,
big fella!

664
00:51:16,557 --> 00:51:21,528
With Private freshly liberated,
we celebrate with a well-earned high one,

665
00:51:21,628 --> 00:51:25,774
and feast off Dave's sweet remains.
Any questions?

666
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:29,470
Whoa-hoa, hey, now!

667
00:51:29,770 --> 00:51:32,273
Wow. I mean, truly impressive.

668
00:51:32,373 --> 00:51:36,242
Especially the bit
where you slap the fruit.

669
00:51:36,342 --> 00:51:40,112
Oh! Corporal, dim the lights.
Short Fuse, glasses.

670
00:51:47,955 --> 00:51:51,458
My apologies. Had to rush a bit.
The schematic's a little crude.

671
00:51:51,558 --> 00:51:53,535
- Where is that music coming from?
- Wow.

672
00:51:53,635 --> 00:51:58,665
All right, at 2150, Skipper,
Kowalski and... Richard, was it?

673
00:51:58,765 --> 00:52:02,235
Die-vert the octopi
away from their posts.

674
00:52:02,535 --> 00:52:05,144
At 2200, Short Fuse breaches the hull

675
00:52:05,244 --> 00:52:08,454
with a swarm of self-guided
underwater nano-charges.

676
00:52:09,176 --> 00:52:10,911
I call them "wet kabooms."

677
00:52:11,011 --> 00:52:12,312
- Yes, please don't.
- Okay, sorry.

678
00:52:12,412 --> 00:52:15,549
- At 2202, knock, knock.
- Who's there?

679
00:52:15,649 --> 00:52:17,928
- The North Wind.
- The North Wind who?

680
00:52:18,028 --> 00:52:21,487
The North Wind who doesn't have time for
knock-knock jokes because we're too busy

681
00:52:21,587 --> 00:52:23,163
taking down Dave.

682
00:52:23,263 --> 00:52:25,359
Personal hover tank... check.

683
00:52:25,459 --> 00:52:27,127
Auto-targeting wing mounts.

684
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:29,649
Why not? At 2209,

685
00:52:30,624 --> 00:52:32,700
mission accomplished.

686
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,780
See that? I don't even look back.

687
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:38,539
There's a huge explosion,
and I just keep walking.

688
00:52:40,341 --> 00:52:41,884
Way to go, boss!

689
00:52:41,984 --> 00:52:44,381
- That's North Wind, sucker!
- Nicely done.

690
00:52:49,149 --> 00:52:51,952
La-di, blah, blah, blah, blah.

691
00:52:52,052 --> 00:52:55,788
A good plan is about more
than effecty stuff and...

692
00:52:55,888 --> 00:52:57,826
vocabulary words.

693
00:52:57,926 --> 00:53:00,830
And you, you... you certainly know
a good plan...

694
00:53:00,930 --> 00:53:06,366
I mean, your operation in Shanghai allowed
Dave to escape with... your boy.

695
00:53:07,985 --> 00:53:13,456
I've never lost a member of my team.
It must feel... awful.

696
00:53:14,975 --> 00:53:17,733
Can't imagine the guilt, the regret,

697
00:53:17,933 --> 00:53:21,068
the feeling that, I don't know, that...

698
00:53:21,168 --> 00:53:22,953
it should have been you.

699
00:53:30,490 --> 00:53:32,328
All for penguin plan?

700
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:37,495
All for North Wind plan?

701
00:53:42,568 --> 00:53:45,940
His... his is better.

702
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:47,686
What?

703
00:53:49,910 --> 00:53:53,614
I'm sorry, boys,
but I can't lead you this time.

704
00:53:53,714 --> 00:53:55,312
But...

705
00:53:56,148 --> 00:53:57,918
we're a team, and...

706
00:53:58,018 --> 00:54:02,288
and you're our skipper, Skipper.
We don't... we don't need these guys.

707
00:54:02,388 --> 00:54:06,460
No, Kowalski, but Private does.

708
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:10,898
I think... it's time we leave it
to the professionals.

709
00:54:10,998 --> 00:54:12,666
- But, sir...
- It's settled.

710
00:54:12,866 --> 00:54:15,436
We take our orders
from Agent Classified now.

711
00:54:16,462 --> 00:54:18,427
That's an order, Rico!

712
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:28,895
All right, Classified...

713
00:54:28,995 --> 00:54:31,521
what's the diversion?

714
00:54:40,494 --> 00:54:43,029
We take this shame to our graves.

715
00:54:43,129 --> 00:54:44,688
Agreed.

716
00:55:09,065 --> 00:55:10,196
Hey!

717
00:55:19,966 --> 00:55:21,768
- Time?
- 2200 hours.

718
00:55:21,868 --> 00:55:24,253
Time to take down Dave.

719
00:55:47,293 --> 00:55:51,148
David the octopus,
show me your tentacles.

720
00:55:54,401 --> 00:55:55,490
All of them.

721
00:56:15,322 --> 00:56:16,399
We lost them, Skipper.

722
00:56:16,499 --> 00:56:21,228
Not a moment too soon.
These hosen are riding up my bundesliga.

723
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:25,667
All right, boys, grab your coconuts
and hold 'em tight.

724
00:56:26,432 --> 00:56:30,676
Classified should be walking away from a
huge explosion with Private on his shoulder

725
00:56:30,776 --> 00:56:35,140
in three... two...
Give 'em a welcome home, Rico!

726
00:56:37,686 --> 00:56:41,315
Yeah! In your face, Dave!
The Private is back!

727
00:56:41,415 --> 00:56:43,850
- Welcome home, Private!
- Yeah! All right!

728
00:56:43,950 --> 00:56:46,186
Here we go. All right.

729
00:56:46,286 --> 00:56:50,157
Sir, the sub didn't explode, and...

730
00:56:50,457 --> 00:56:54,426
I fear the... fireworks may
have been a tactical mistake.

731
00:57:03,603 --> 00:57:06,606
Stay calm! Do not panic!

732
00:57:06,806 --> 00:57:10,344
We will still win!
Be full of love! Don't hate!

733
00:57:10,544 --> 00:57:13,847
Follow your dreams!
Love yourself! Love other people!

734
00:57:13,947 --> 00:57:17,799
Pick and choose your battles in life!
Don't let anyone tell you what to do!

735
00:57:17,899 --> 00:57:20,787
Ignore the haters!
Love the one you're with!

736
00:57:20,887 --> 00:57:22,307
- Love the one you're with!
- Eva.

737
00:57:25,158 --> 00:57:26,799
I know.

738
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:36,302
Welcome, Skipper,
Kowalski and rootin'-tootin' Rico!

739
00:57:36,402 --> 00:57:39,172
The gang's all here!
The mood is electric!

740
00:57:39,272 --> 00:57:42,342
Is this really, finally everybody?

741
00:57:42,442 --> 00:57:44,611
All right, Dave,
just what have you done with...

742
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:47,113
- Private!
- Oh! Guys!

743
00:57:47,413 --> 00:57:50,416
- You're in for it now, Dave!
- Really?!

744
00:57:50,516 --> 00:57:55,655
Anyway, great catching up. Now, who's ready
to move on to live penguin testing?

745
00:57:55,755 --> 00:57:58,936
You point that death ray away
from Private right now!

746
00:57:59,036 --> 00:58:03,163
It's not a death ray, Skipper.
He's gonna turn us into monsters!

747
00:58:03,263 --> 00:58:06,733
Yepper-doo! "And what comes next, Dave?"

748
00:58:06,833 --> 00:58:08,570
Invasion!

749
00:58:08,670 --> 00:58:13,073
Horrible mutant penguins unleashed
on the streets of New York City!

750
00:58:13,173 --> 00:58:17,243
- You're the monster!
- Yes! I'm the monster.

751
00:58:17,343 --> 00:58:22,482
Everyone made that clear to me
every day of my entire life.

752
00:58:22,782 --> 00:58:27,133
But now, let's see how much everyone
loves you when you're the monster!

753
00:58:27,233 --> 00:58:29,656
- Skipper!
- You can't take away Private's cuteness!

754
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:32,125
He's the cute one!
That's-that's his thing.

755
00:58:32,225 --> 00:58:34,561
- What?
- It's all the little guy's got!

756
00:58:35,896 --> 00:58:39,159
You are super cute.
We better crank this up.

757
00:58:39,259 --> 00:58:41,400
Drew, Barry, more power.

758
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:43,770
- Ready?
- Negotiations have broken down.

759
00:58:43,870 --> 00:58:46,539
Rico, the paper clip!
Bust us out of here!

760
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:49,943
We need that paper clip!
Chop-chop, soldier!

761
00:58:53,513 --> 00:58:55,382
No! Where's the paper clip?

762
00:58:57,717 --> 00:58:58,987
Private!

763
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:07,201
No!

764
00:59:12,165 --> 00:59:14,333
- Private...
- Oh, no.

765
00:59:16,202 --> 00:59:18,805
I disintegrated him.

766
00:59:19,205 --> 00:59:21,408
That wasn't supposed to happen.

767
00:59:21,508 --> 00:59:25,243
You maniac! You blew him up!

768
00:59:25,708 --> 00:59:26,980
No.

769
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:30,183
Oh, well, this is why
we test things, people.

770
00:59:30,583 --> 00:59:34,021
I'll have to lower
the power for the others.

771
00:59:35,121 --> 00:59:40,663
Full speed ahead, gentlemen.
The monsters are due in Manhattan!

772
01:00:07,254 --> 01:00:08,672
Sorry.

773
01:00:20,567 --> 01:00:22,213
Crikey.

774
01:00:23,374 --> 01:00:27,843
All right, all right, octopus.
Whatever Dave's paying you, I'll double it.

775
01:00:29,309 --> 01:00:31,957
- Is that a yes? Does anyone speak octopus?
- Sorry.

776
01:00:32,057 --> 01:00:33,713
- No, not a clue.
- Blast it.

777
01:00:34,614 --> 01:00:38,384
You... free... us.

778
01:00:38,484 --> 01:00:42,322
We give you... many fishes.

779
01:00:46,493 --> 01:00:47,730
What is that?

780
01:00:54,534 --> 01:00:56,569
- Oh, great.
- Oh, no! This is it!

781
01:00:56,669 --> 01:00:59,194
I don't want to die all squishy!

782
01:01:02,676 --> 01:01:06,112
We're dead! Dead! Dead! Dead!

783
01:01:06,212 --> 01:01:08,304
Oh, no, we're dead!

784
01:01:08,782 --> 01:01:11,433
Dead! Dead...!

785
01:01:14,687 --> 01:01:17,023
I pushed a button.

786
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:21,361
- Super. Well done, Private!
- Good work,<i> malinki.</i>

787
01:01:21,461 --> 01:01:24,004
Yay. Yes. Yes.

788
01:01:24,104 --> 01:01:28,033
Excellent button-pushing.
Compliment, praise, et cetera.

789
01:01:28,133 --> 01:01:31,204
All right, agents,
we are back in business.

790
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:38,081
Wait! Skipper, Kowalski, Rico,
all those penguins,

791
01:01:38,181 --> 01:01:41,014
- they're this way!
- And so is a massive army of octopi.

792
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:43,917
And as soon as we return to the North
Wind headquarters, grab fresh equipment,

793
01:01:44,017 --> 01:01:49,088
and work up a smashing new plan,
we'll come speeding back and take down Dave.

794
01:01:49,188 --> 01:01:52,392
But the penguins are in danger!
We have to go now!

795
01:01:52,492 --> 01:01:55,028
Again, huge army of octopi.

796
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:57,798
So, because you failed once,
you're just running away?

797
01:01:57,898 --> 01:02:01,467
We did not fail.
And we are not running away.

798
01:02:01,567 --> 01:02:03,603
We're just very sensibly regrouping.

799
01:02:03,703 --> 01:02:08,240
Skipper wouldn't care.
Plan or no, fancy equipment or no...

800
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:10,577
he'd never leave a man behind.

801
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:14,186
Well, I suppose we can't all
be penguins, can we?

802
01:02:20,486 --> 01:02:21,355
No.

803
01:02:22,555 --> 01:02:25,098
But maybe you should be.

804
01:02:32,598 --> 01:02:33,869
Come on.

805
01:02:42,776 --> 01:02:46,479
Showtime, everyone!
Big smiles for the Big Apple!

806
01:02:46,779 --> 01:02:51,384
Listen up, Doris! You turn us
into freaks, and then what?

807
01:02:51,484 --> 01:02:54,487
You think that's gonna
make everybody love you?

808
01:02:55,287 --> 01:02:57,524
No, but they'll despise you.

809
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:04,333
And I'm sure gonna love that.

810
01:03:13,472 --> 01:03:16,709
Breaking news!
The missing penguins have been found!

811
01:03:16,809 --> 01:03:20,329
Okay. According to my notes,
genetic researcher Dr. Octavius Brine

812
01:03:20,429 --> 01:03:23,182
has found the penguins and is bringing them
here to New York's Battery Park.

813
01:03:23,282 --> 01:03:27,286
The penguins are coming back!
Oh, my gosh! Look!

814
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:58,185
Penguin lovers of the world,
guess who I found.

815
01:03:58,285 --> 01:04:00,287
Penguins! Penguins!

816
01:04:00,387 --> 01:04:05,024
It wasn't easy, but seeing the penguins
get what they deserve

817
01:04:05,124 --> 01:04:07,327
will make it all worthwhile.

818
01:04:07,527 --> 01:04:11,231
What a weird thing to say!
I'm so excited!

819
01:04:11,431 --> 01:04:12,199
Do it.

820
01:04:25,044 --> 01:04:28,180
Skipper! Skipper!
Skipper! Rico! Kowalski!

821
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:32,351
It's like I can still hear
his little voice calling to us.

822
01:04:32,451 --> 01:04:35,220
You have to get out of there! Move!

823
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:37,490
"You have a great otter, there.

824
01:04:37,590 --> 01:04:40,026
- Moo."
- Why would he moo?

825
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:44,213
What are you asking me for?
I'm not Private's little ghost.

826
01:04:50,001 --> 01:04:51,256
No!

827
01:04:52,973 --> 01:04:56,452
Are you ready?!

828
01:04:57,102 --> 01:04:58,611
Yeah!

829
01:05:00,245 --> 01:05:02,168
Yay...!

830
01:05:06,552 --> 01:05:08,340
Your new...

831
01:05:08,788 --> 01:05:10,023
and improved...

832
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:12,523
penguins!

833
01:05:12,623 --> 01:05:14,894
Penguins! Penguins!

834
01:05:22,568 --> 01:05:24,037
Wha...?

835
01:05:33,413 --> 01:05:37,371
Oh, the people love you.
Just go give them a hug.

836
01:05:46,326 --> 01:05:47,695
Don't let them touch you!

837
01:05:56,569 --> 01:06:01,040
Oh, no. What's happening?
Nobody likes you anymore?

838
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:04,678
Well, the fun and games are just beginning.
Watch this, penguins.

839
01:06:04,778 --> 01:06:07,547
Somebody call... the exterminators!

840
01:06:16,556 --> 01:06:21,694
And when the exterminators take you away,
you never come back.

841
01:06:46,452 --> 01:06:47,353
Oh, dear.

842
01:06:47,853 --> 01:06:51,225
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.
What do I do? What do I do?

843
01:06:52,525 --> 01:06:53,724
Crikey!

844
01:06:58,764 --> 01:07:01,968
Come on, then. You want to go?
You want some argy-bargy?

845
01:07:27,959 --> 01:07:29,461
Missed one.

846
01:07:30,797 --> 01:07:33,065
What a wonderful day in the park.

847
01:07:33,165 --> 01:07:33,976
Skipper!

848
01:07:39,539 --> 01:07:40,807
Wait!

849
01:07:42,508 --> 01:07:44,547
Hold on! What are you doing?!

850
01:07:47,847 --> 01:07:48,648
Skipper!

851
01:07:50,482 --> 01:07:52,098
Don't eat that!

852
01:07:52,819 --> 01:07:56,288
Skipper, listen. It's me, Private.

853
01:07:56,388 --> 01:08:00,931
I've got a plan, but I need your help.
I need my Skipper.

854
01:08:22,916 --> 01:08:25,584
- Private?
- Yes. That's it.

855
01:08:25,784 --> 01:08:28,287
Private, you're alive!

856
01:08:29,621 --> 01:08:31,405
Oh, God!

857
01:08:44,770 --> 01:08:47,272
Kowalski! You've got to get a grip!

858
01:08:48,301 --> 01:08:51,443
Kowalski, Eva is worried about you.

859
01:08:51,543 --> 01:08:55,280
She is? What did she say?
Did she say my name specifically?

860
01:08:55,380 --> 01:08:59,085
I mean, were there... were there tears?
Details, come on, tell me!

861
01:08:59,185 --> 01:09:02,087
Private! You're alive. Come here.

862
01:09:02,187 --> 01:09:05,223
This feels a little awkward,
but I'm happy.

863
01:09:09,455 --> 01:09:11,864
Rico! You need to listen to us.

864
01:09:11,964 --> 01:09:14,634
I guess you're kind of
the same either way.

865
01:09:14,834 --> 01:09:16,335
Private!

866
01:09:16,670 --> 01:09:17,904
Heads up!

867
01:09:20,506 --> 01:09:23,174
Looks like we're back in business, boys.

868
01:09:23,274 --> 01:09:26,146
And our business is saving penguin-kind.

869
01:09:26,646 --> 01:09:29,181
- Who's with me?
- Count me in.

870
01:09:29,281 --> 01:09:30,683
- Let's do this!
- Boo-hah!

871
01:09:30,783 --> 01:09:33,191
- Yeah!
- Let's create and feel momentum.

872
01:09:38,391 --> 01:09:40,793
Sir, how long do we
stand here like this?

873
01:09:40,893 --> 01:09:44,599
Until we've reached maximum coolness.

874
01:09:46,999 --> 01:09:48,233
There it is.

875
01:09:48,433 --> 01:09:51,941
- Now all we need is a plan.
- I've got one.

876
01:09:55,141 --> 01:09:57,176
You stole Dave's ray?

877
01:09:57,276 --> 01:10:00,479
Well, I figured if we could
reverse the ray,

878
01:10:00,579 --> 01:10:03,449
we could turn everyone back to normal.

879
01:10:03,549 --> 01:10:04,732
Reverse the ray?

880
01:10:04,832 --> 01:10:08,035
That's brilliant!
But... it's impossible!

881
01:10:08,135 --> 01:10:11,132
In order to reverse the ray, we would
need to replace the Medusa Serum

882
01:10:11,232 --> 01:10:14,660
with a power source of almost
immeasurable cuteness.

883
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:18,713
Immeasurable cuteness? Where the heck
are we supposed to get that?

884
01:10:29,876 --> 01:10:33,651
No, wait. Private, no!
We don't know what that will do to you!

885
01:10:36,348 --> 01:10:39,986
- All right!
- The ray! It works! It works!

886
01:10:40,086 --> 01:10:43,055
- Private! Are you okay?
- Yes!

887
01:10:44,453 --> 01:10:47,025
Butt-hand!
There's a hand attached to his butt.

888
01:10:47,125 --> 01:10:49,282
That was not...
that was not there before.

889
01:10:49,382 --> 01:10:52,530
- Get out of there! That's an order!
- Permission to defy order.

890
01:10:52,630 --> 01:10:54,779
- Permission denied!
- Then I deny your denial.

891
01:10:54,879 --> 01:10:58,367
It's too risky, Private.
It already made you sprout a butt-hand!

892
01:10:58,567 --> 01:11:00,695
I know it has to be me this time.

893
01:11:02,241 --> 01:11:04,977
And I think you know it, too.

894
01:11:18,724 --> 01:11:20,893
I'm the secret weapon.

895
01:11:30,636 --> 01:11:34,540
I'm happy... and yet...

896
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:38,587
now that I have my revenge, I feel...

897
01:11:38,687 --> 01:11:44,314
empty, as if what I needed
all along was...

898
01:11:44,614 --> 01:11:47,954
more revenge! In fact...
Robin, write this down...

899
01:11:48,054 --> 01:11:53,327
Tomorrow we move on to kittens!
Then puppies, bunnies, pandas...

900
01:11:55,627 --> 01:11:57,198
Charlize, they're on the ray!

901
01:11:58,998 --> 01:12:02,101
Helen, hunt them down!
William, hurt them.

902
01:12:02,201 --> 01:12:05,938
Halle, bury them!
Hugh, Jack, man the battle stations!

903
01:12:06,038 --> 01:12:10,376
Kevin, bake on! We're still
gonna need that victory cake!

904
01:12:18,216 --> 01:12:22,455
We're only gonna get one shot at this, boys!
How we doing on those snow globes?

905
01:12:22,955 --> 01:12:26,212
Beam splitter ready! Fire at will!

906
01:12:27,423 --> 01:12:28,561
Do it, Skipper!

907
01:12:41,206 --> 01:12:44,344
- Dead batteries?!
- Game over, Skipper!

908
01:12:46,379 --> 01:12:47,481
No!

909
01:12:48,581 --> 01:12:51,408
Rico, batteries! Skipper! Kowalski!

910
01:12:51,508 --> 01:12:54,928
Hold off those octopi!
We're doing this now!

911
01:12:55,989 --> 01:12:58,624
You heard Private! Deploy!

912
01:13:16,568 --> 01:13:19,094
Get back, you aquatic savages!

913
01:13:19,194 --> 01:13:22,181
Behind you! Beside you!
Six o'clock! Twelve o'clock!

914
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:30,655
- They're coming from every direction!
- There's just too many of them!

915
01:13:50,943 --> 01:13:53,105
- Whoa.
- You came back!

916
01:14:02,037 --> 01:14:05,358
Oh... that's why you
look back at the explosion.

917
01:14:13,999 --> 01:14:16,346
I can dream...

918
01:14:19,905 --> 01:14:21,870
Fallback positions!

919
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:24,210
Stay away from Private!

920
01:14:28,781 --> 01:14:31,184
Suck it up, Kowalski.

921
01:14:33,653 --> 01:14:34,686
No!

922
01:14:34,786 --> 01:14:36,840
It's over, Skipper.

923
01:14:36,940 --> 01:14:42,561
Over? That's weird. Then why is Rico
throwing me a fresh pair of double-A's?

924
01:14:46,766 --> 01:14:49,089
- No!
- The remote!

925
01:14:57,210 --> 01:14:58,454
Rico! Dibble me!

926
01:15:56,535 --> 01:15:58,938
It worked! Private!

927
01:15:59,558 --> 01:16:03,977
Excuse me. Emergency. Coming through.
Make a hole! Make a hole!

928
01:16:08,679 --> 01:16:14,520
Don't worry, a chrysalis is just forming
around you. That's perfectly normal.

929
01:16:26,498 --> 01:16:27,931
Private.

930
01:16:29,668 --> 01:16:30,647
Wha...?

931
01:16:37,594 --> 01:16:38,515
Private?

932
01:16:42,881 --> 01:16:46,470
- Oh! Look at that! Majestic.
- Hello.

933
01:16:46,686 --> 01:16:48,605
- Private!
- Oh! Hey!

934
01:16:48,705 --> 01:16:50,323
- What's wrong? What are you...
- Look out for the...

935
01:16:50,423 --> 01:16:52,184
- Have I got something...
- Cover your eyes.

936
01:16:52,284 --> 01:16:55,127
- Is there a... thing?
- Don't turn your head.

937
01:16:55,227 --> 01:16:58,132
So... how do I look?

938
01:16:59,532 --> 01:17:03,636
You're hideously disfigured
and will probably be hunted for sport.

939
01:17:03,836 --> 01:17:06,435
- What?
- What?

940
01:17:06,638 --> 01:17:12,110
If there's anything we've learned from
this delightful adventure... Kowalski...

941
01:17:12,210 --> 01:17:14,280
It's that looks don't matter.

942
01:17:14,980 --> 01:17:17,683
It's what you do that counts.

943
01:17:18,883 --> 01:17:21,125
And look at what you did.

944
01:17:41,673 --> 01:17:43,508
Yes, sir...

945
01:17:43,608 --> 01:17:48,455
you are the most meaningful
and valued member of this team.

946
01:18:06,164 --> 01:18:08,176
Way to go, Private!

947
01:18:08,276 --> 01:18:09,812
Attaboy!

948
01:18:09,912 --> 01:18:11,670
Nicely done.

949
01:18:12,531 --> 01:18:17,009
- Way to go, Private! You did it!
- We're so proud of you!

950
01:18:17,309 --> 01:18:20,880
- You saved us!
- We love you, Private!

951
01:18:20,980 --> 01:18:24,783
- Yeah, we love you!
- You the penguin!

952
01:18:44,343 --> 01:18:45,271
Ramirez!

953
01:18:45,371 --> 01:18:46,939
- Dave.
- Dave!

954
01:18:52,845 --> 01:18:56,261
What? Are you kidding me?!

955
01:18:57,611 --> 01:19:01,586
- Dave... look at you.
- You think this is over?

956
01:19:01,686 --> 01:19:05,360
- I'm just getting started. I'm about to...
- What do we do with him now?

957
01:19:05,656 --> 01:19:07,793
Open this right now!

958
01:19:07,993 --> 01:19:09,461
Here you go, kid.

959
01:19:12,097 --> 01:19:13,725
Cool!

960
01:19:19,768 --> 01:19:21,707
I hope you find happiness, Dave.

961
01:19:23,036 --> 01:19:27,192
It's snowing! It's snowing! It's snowing!
It's snowing! It's snowing! It's snowing...

962
01:19:29,456 --> 01:19:30,616
Right, now, then...

963
01:19:31,983 --> 01:19:35,420
- this is difficult for me to say.
- Is it "osteoporosis"?

964
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:38,340
You just got to lean into the vowel.
Os-teo...

965
01:19:38,690 --> 01:19:40,826
- poro...
- No! No.

966
01:19:40,926 --> 01:19:45,164
I want to say... you four are
the bravest agents I've ever known.

967
01:19:46,664 --> 01:19:49,885
The point is... I was wrong about you,

968
01:19:49,985 --> 01:19:53,606
and I hope... there's some
way I can make it right.

969
01:19:53,716 --> 01:19:56,074
- Give us jet packs.
- We should kiss.

970
01:19:57,275 --> 01:20:00,046
Did... did you just say...

971
01:20:04,429 --> 01:20:05,918
Well, that feels right!

972
01:20:06,068 --> 01:20:09,153
I think I'd actually prefer
a jet pack, please.

973
01:20:09,453 --> 01:20:12,278
I think we should go
with Private's idea.

974
01:20:15,180 --> 01:20:16,678
Yeah!

975
01:20:17,095 --> 01:20:19,164
Kowalski! What's our trajectory?

976
01:20:19,264 --> 01:20:22,567
95% certain this will end in massive...

977
01:20:22,667 --> 01:20:24,135
flaming disaster!

978
01:20:24,235 --> 01:20:27,339
- And the other five percent?
- Irrelevant, sir!

979
01:20:27,439 --> 01:20:30,342
- Jet packs are awesome!
- Agreed!

980
01:20:40,252 --> 01:20:42,537
Who says penguins can't fly?

981
01:21:25,330 --> 01:21:28,666
<i>Skipper, we are going to
turn me back to normal, right?</i>

982
01:21:28,766 --> 01:21:31,105
<i>Absolutely. First thing Monday.</i>

983
01:21:34,453 --> 01:21:38,043
- I'm in a rocket ship!
- I want to push the button.

984
01:21:38,143 --> 01:21:40,212
- Give me that!
- Hey! Stealer!

985
01:21:40,312 --> 01:21:44,582
- Let's do this! I'm ready!
- Okay, on three. One, three, go.

986
01:21:44,783 --> 01:21:48,912
I'm just gonna do a little practice push.
Okay, I'm not going to press it.

987
01:21:49,012 --> 01:21:51,757
Why are you smacking my hand?
Hey, look over there!

988
01:21:52,357 --> 01:21:53,963
I'm a laser show.

989
01:21:55,427 --> 01:21:56,528
Julien!

990
01:21:58,377 --> 01:22:01,500
Now, that's the Private
we know and love. High one!

991
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:05,671
- Immeasurable cuteness, right there!
- Good to be back.

992
01:22:05,971 --> 01:22:08,808
I feel like a French fry!

993
01:22:09,623 --> 01:22:13,078
- I'm okay!
- And with cuteness to spare!

994
01:22:13,178 --> 01:22:16,578
Come on! Frosty mugs
of herring juice all around!

995
01:22:16,678 --> 01:22:17,816
- Private's buying.
- What?

996
01:22:17,916 --> 01:22:22,853
You know, if I'm being honest,
I expected a little more... pizzazz!

997
01:22:24,438 --> 01:22:27,389
Yes! Now, that's pizzazz!
