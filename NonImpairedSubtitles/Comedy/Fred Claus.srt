01:11:23,404 --> 01:11:25,531
Well, I hope you're happy
with yourself, Fred.

1186
01:11:25,698 --> 01:11:27,950
Look, Annette, I want my money.
A deal's a deal.

1187
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:31,621
ANNETTE: Yeah.

1188
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:34,206
Personally,
I don't think you deserve a cent.

1189
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:39,503
Oh. He wanted you to have this too.

1190
01:11:42,173 --> 01:11:45,885
Merry Christmas, Fred.

1191
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:53,559
Let's go, Willie.

1192
01:11:56,604 --> 01:11:58,230
NICK: Well, well.

1193
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:03,819
Mr. Northcutt.

1194
01:12:04,445 --> 01:12:05,863
You wanted to see me, sir.

1195
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:07,072
Yes, I did.

1196
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:10,242
Bring up Fred Claus
from earlier today, please.

1197
01:12:31,597 --> 01:12:34,683
Well, now, we can correct that.
We can correct that.

1198
01:12:34,851 --> 01:12:38,145
Charlene. We still have
plenty of time, don't we?

1199
01:12:38,312 --> 01:12:40,605
With less than three days
to go until Christmas...

1200
01:12:40,773 --> 01:12:43,275
you now have no way
of making your quota.

1201
01:12:43,693 --> 01:12:47,071
And I think you know what that means.

1202
01:12:47,238 --> 01:12:50,908
Strike three.

1203
01:12:52,118 --> 01:12:55,037
Look, it gives me no great pleasure
to have to say this, but...

1204
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:59,458
Well, actually, who am I kidding,
this is a fantastic moment for me.

1205
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:00,751
[LAUGHS]

1206
01:13:15,266 --> 01:13:16,392
NICK: Huh.

1207
01:13:17,143 --> 01:13:18,978
You're fired.

1208
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:20,312

01:13:27,153 --> 01:13:30,531
LEON [ON MACHINE]: <i>Hey, Fred, it's Leon.
It's the 22nd. This is your big day, buddy.</i>

1210
01:13:30,698 --> 01:13:34,284
<i>Get that 50 G's in my hands.
Call me back. Let's do this.</i>

1211
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:29,131
STALLONE:
And I, uh, feel this way all the time.

1212
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:31,258
It's not like I didn't want
my brother to succeed.

1213
01:14:31,384 --> 01:14:34,678
We were very close growing up.
I mean, we shared bunk beds.

1214
01:14:34,845 --> 01:14:37,013
He was my roadie,
used to carry my amps.

1215
01:14:37,515 --> 01:14:40,059
And my mother always told me,
since I was a little kid:

1216
01:14:40,226 --> 01:14:44,104
"You're gonna support your brother."
And so that was gonna be my job.

1217
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:48,442
And then <i>Rocky</i> came out,
and, uh, things changed, you know?

1218
01:14:48,609 --> 01:14:50,902
I was the first guy in line.
I mean, I was there.

1219
01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:53,906
And then when <i>Rocky III</i> came out...

1220
01:14:54,073 --> 01:14:56,658
I was starting to wonder who
Frank Stallone was, you know?

1221
01:14:56,826 --> 01:14:58,410
It was like identity theft.

1222
01:14:58,577 --> 01:15:00,912
You're fighting Rambo
and you're fighting Rocky...

1223
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:04,416
and trying to keep them at bay
so you can get you to come through.

1224
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:08,086
Well, anyway, I wanna
thank you guys for listening.

1225
01:15:08,254 --> 01:15:10,673
I feel good coming here. I like it here.

1226
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:13,926
GROUP LEADER:
Wonderful. Thanks for sharing, Frank.

1227
01:15:14,093 --> 01:15:17,930
Okay. Now, I think we go to Roger.

1228
01:15:18,097 --> 01:15:21,517
Um, I actually have some things
I'd like to talk about if...

1229
01:15:21,684 --> 01:15:24,103
Okay, you're just gonna have
to wait your turn.

1230
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:28,065
Roger's been waiting, and we didn't get
to him last time, so we'll go to Roger.

1231
01:15:28,232 --> 01:15:32,194
- I have a lot of stuff boiling right now, so...
- I appreciate that. After Roger.

1232
01:15:32,945 --> 01:15:35,530
- Okay.
- Roger?

1233
01:15:36,115 --> 01:15:38,075
I'm Roger, I'm a recovering sibling.

1234
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:39,952
ALL: Hi, Roger.

1235
01:15:40,119 --> 01:15:42,621
My brother's Bill Clinton.

1236
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:45,540
My brother was the
president of the United States.

1237
01:15:45,833 --> 01:15:48,752
You know, I was flipping
through the channels on the TV...

1238
01:15:48,919 --> 01:15:53,419
and on the History Channel was the
State of the Union Address from 1993.

1239
01:15:54,467 --> 01:15:58,967
When we left the White House, I thought
it was gonna be the first step to recovery.

1240
01:16:00,264 --> 01:16:03,725
But no, I started to cry again.

1241
01:16:04,477 --> 01:16:08,977
And I just don't know if I'm ever, you
know, gonna be able to fully recover now.

1242
01:16:10,149 --> 01:16:13,652
Maybe that's a place where I could jump in,
share what's going on with me.

1243
01:16:13,819 --> 01:16:15,946
- Who are you?
- I'm Fred.

1244
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:18,740
- ALL: Hi, Fred.
- Hi.

1245
01:16:19,450 --> 01:16:21,452
Go ahead.
Would you like to take a turn now?

1246
01:16:21,994 --> 01:16:24,997
- My name is Fred Claus.
ALL: Hi, Fred.

1247
01:16:25,790 --> 01:16:27,124
Hi.

1248
01:16:27,291 --> 01:16:28,792
I'm, uh...

1249
01:16:30,002 --> 01:16:32,295
Uh, I'm Santa Claus' brother.

1250
01:16:33,047 --> 01:16:36,675
And I got a lot of stuff
going on, uh, because of it.

1251
01:16:36,967 --> 01:16:41,346
There's a lot of things... There's a lot
of, um, juice in the tank over it.

1252
01:16:41,514 --> 01:16:44,141
- And, uh...
- Is this a joke to you?

1253
01:16:44,308 --> 01:16:46,518
- Stephen, by the way.
ALL: Hi, Stephen.

1254
01:16:46,685 --> 01:16:47,936
Hey, guys, what's up?

1255
01:16:48,104 --> 01:16:52,525
I mean, because this isn't funny
to all of us here in the group.

1256
01:16:52,691 --> 01:16:54,651
Okay, this is very serious to us.

1257
01:16:54,819 --> 01:16:58,489
And I'm feeling very uncomfortable
with where you're coming from.

1258
01:16:58,656 --> 01:17:00,824
Wait, Stephen...

1259
01:17:00,991 --> 01:17:04,369
maybe to him,
his brother is Santa Claus.

1260
01:17:04,537 --> 01:17:06,205
Feel like my brother's Santa Claus.

1261
01:17:06,372 --> 01:17:10,584
But I feel like my brother's Santa Claus
because my brother really is Santa Claus.

1262
01:17:10,751 --> 01:17:13,920
All right, that's enough, all right!
You and I got a problem!

1263
01:17:14,088 --> 01:17:17,758
GROUP LEADER: Stephen, easy, easy.
All right. Stephen, easy.

1264
01:17:19,176 --> 01:17:21,595
That's not Alec, okay?

1265
01:17:21,929 --> 01:17:24,514
Don't look at me, look at him.

1266
01:17:24,682 --> 01:17:25,891
That's not Alec.

1267
01:17:26,225 --> 01:17:27,476
That's not Alec.

1268
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:29,895
I'm not Alec, you know what I mean?

1269
01:17:30,062 --> 01:17:31,688
All right, let's stomp it out.

1270
01:17:31,856 --> 01:17:33,732
- It's not Alec.
GROUP LEADER: Alec's not gonna hear.

1271
01:17:33,899 --> 01:17:34,983
How's he gonna...?

1272
01:17:35,192 --> 01:17:37,569
- That's not Alec.
GROUP LEADER: Okay, that's not Alec.

1273
01:17:37,736 --> 01:17:39,738
- That's not Alec!
GROUP LEADER: That's not Alec.

1274
01:17:39,947 --> 01:17:42,366
- That's not Alec!
GROUP LEADER: All right.

1275
01:17:42,533 --> 01:17:46,662
Now that you've got Alec's attention,
Stephen, what do you wanna tell him?

1276
01:17:47,413 --> 01:17:51,913
Stephen, I think I know
where you're coming from...

1277
01:17:52,418 --> 01:17:55,254
because I used to be really,
really angry with my brother.

1278
01:17:55,796 --> 01:18:00,296
I didn't want to become first brother,
especially for the rest of my life.

1279
01:18:00,759 --> 01:18:04,429
I couldn't control being brother
of the president of the United States.

1280
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:08,141
But I could control
being Bill Clinton's brother.

1281
01:18:08,309 --> 01:18:11,437
And I made the decision, even though
I could have brought the house down...

1282
01:18:12,104 --> 01:18:15,774
I made the decision that,
for the love of my brother...

1283
01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:18,526
and for the love of my family name...

1284
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:22,281
that I was gonna do
whatever it took...

1285
01:18:22,781 --> 01:18:24,949
because I loved my brother...

1286
01:18:25,117 --> 01:18:29,454
and I was always gonna be there
for my brother. And I have been.

1287
01:18:29,622 --> 01:18:31,373
And you know what?

1288
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:33,917
You can be too.

1289
01:18:38,964 --> 01:18:40,715
The Travel Experts?

1290
01:18:40,883 --> 01:18:44,761
Yeah. I need to get to the North Pole
right away, like, tonight.

1291
01:18:45,596 --> 01:18:48,724
Yeah, I got $50,000 in cash
that says I'm not kidding.

1292
01:19:09,119 --> 01:19:11,913
- Oh, North Pole. North Pole.
FRED: North Pole is there?

1293
01:19:12,081 --> 01:19:14,750
- Safe journeys to you, and thank you.
- Ha.

1294
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:47,408
Willie, gather all the elves and meet me
in the Workshop right now. Let's go.

1295
01:19:50,703 --> 01:19:52,204
Look, guys...

1296
01:19:52,496 --> 01:19:56,541
we gotta make as many presents
as we can in the next 10 hours.

1297
01:19:56,709 --> 01:19:58,043
WILLIE:
Fred, it's Christmas Eve.

1298
01:19:58,210 --> 01:20:02,710
It's impossible. We just can't build
that many toys in that time.

1299
01:20:03,674 --> 01:20:06,301
The rule says that every kid gets a toy.

1300
01:20:06,468 --> 01:20:10,722
So, what would be the easiest toy to make?
One for boys and one for girls.

1301
01:20:10,889 --> 01:20:13,057
- A baseball bat.
- A Hula-Hoop.

1302
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:15,894
FRED: Well, baseball bats
and Hula-Hoops it is, then.

1303
01:20:16,312 --> 01:20:20,274
Charlene, do you think it's possible we can
make enough gifts to meet our quota?

1304
01:20:20,441 --> 01:20:24,069
Baseball bats, lose four seconds, 55...

1305
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:27,406
Yeah, it is possible.

1306
01:20:27,573 --> 01:20:30,867
It is, but, Fred, that's not what
the kids asked for.

1307
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:34,496
Yeah, but all that matters is that
each of the kids get a toy.

1308
01:20:34,663 --> 01:20:38,708
That they all have something that they can
open when they wake up in the morning.

1309
01:20:38,876 --> 01:20:42,880
Most importantly, they all know that there's
somebody who's thinking about them.

1310
01:20:43,881 --> 01:20:46,842
You guys have never missed
a Christmas before.

1311
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:50,512
If you guys are gonna go out this year...

1312
01:20:52,139 --> 01:20:54,266
you're gonna go out trying.

1313
01:21:14,203 --> 01:21:16,205
Okay. We're on it.

1314
01:21:17,122 --> 01:21:19,249
- I've never seen him...
- That's because he's...

1315
01:21:19,416 --> 01:21:22,043
- thrown his back out.
- No.

1316
01:21:22,211 --> 01:21:24,463
- Hey, Annette, how you doing?
- Fred.

1317
01:21:24,671 --> 01:21:28,466
Nick, I think we're gonna make it. I got
elves in the Workshop making presents.

1318
01:21:28,634 --> 01:21:30,927
We're cutting corners,
but I think we can make it.

1319
01:21:31,095 --> 01:21:34,264
You'll still be able to save Christmas.
We don't have a lot of time.

1320
01:21:34,431 --> 01:21:38,059
That's impossible.
The man can hardly carry his own weight.

1321
01:21:38,268 --> 01:21:40,103
NICK: I can't move.

1322
01:21:42,356 --> 01:21:44,441
I can't, Fred.

1323
01:21:45,526 --> 01:21:47,361
You can do it. It's Christmas, come on.

1324
01:21:47,528 --> 01:21:51,823
- The kids are out there, counting on us.
- Oh, boy, I wish I could.

1325
01:21:53,867 --> 01:21:56,828
Willie, this is your big night.
This is your big night, pal.

1326
01:21:56,995 --> 01:21:59,163
You're gonna deliver the presents.
Willie can.

1327
01:21:59,331 --> 01:22:01,082
No, Fred, I can't.

1328
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:03,377
Of course you can.
You're great on that sleigh.

1329
01:22:03,544 --> 01:22:06,672
No, no, you don't understand. I
