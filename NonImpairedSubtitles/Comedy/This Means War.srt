1
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,891
- All eyes are up.
- Sat cams are good.

2
00:00:47,403 --> 00:00:48,631
Target is inbound.

3
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:50,529
ETA five minutes.

4
00:00:50,706 --> 00:00:53,698
Mission is a go.
Repeat, you are green to go.

5
00:00:53,876 --> 00:00:56,811
<i>Intercept and apprehend
the Heinrich brothers.</i>

6
00:00:56,979 --> 00:01:03,077
<i>Secure the device.
And remember, this mission is covert.</i>

7
00:01:10,492 --> 00:01:11,686
I've got some action.

8
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,761
Hi, my name is Xenia.
- Pleased to meet you. I'm Tuck.

9
00:01:14,931 --> 00:01:15,955
FDR.

10
00:01:16,132 --> 00:01:18,157
So what brings you to Hong Kong?

11
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:19,800
- Business or pleasure?
- Pleasure.

12
00:01:19,969 --> 00:01:21,300
- Business.
- A little of both.

13
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:22,767
What kind of business?

14
00:01:22,939 --> 00:01:26,431
I am a cruise ship captain
of a very large vessel.

15
00:01:26,608 --> 00:01:29,873
My small friend here
is a kick-ass travel agent.

16
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,377
Permission to come aboard, captain?

17
00:01:33,882 --> 00:01:37,340
On that note, will you excuse us, ladies,
because we do have work to do.

18
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,920
- No, we don't.
- Yes, we do.

19
00:01:43,725 --> 00:01:44,919
Yes, we do.

20
00:01:55,604 --> 00:01:56,969
That's a lovely suit.

21
00:01:57,606 --> 00:02:00,598
Well, it is Savile Row's finest.

22
00:02:16,191 --> 00:02:18,921
I see you brought your baby brother
to protect you.

23
00:02:20,028 --> 00:02:21,154
What did you say?

24
00:02:24,032 --> 00:02:25,124
Let's go, Jonas.

25
00:02:27,636 --> 00:02:29,399
<i>Shots fired. Men down.</i>

26
00:02:35,577 --> 00:02:37,169
All right. Here we go.

27
00:02:59,433 --> 00:03:01,128
Mag. I need a mag.

28
00:03:34,168 --> 00:03:35,396
Shoot him.

29
00:03:51,918 --> 00:03:53,545
Tuck!

30
00:04:03,697 --> 00:04:04,823
Jonas!

31
00:04:48,808 --> 00:04:52,505
- Heinrich is not gonna be happy.
- I'm more concerned about the boss.

32
00:04:52,678 --> 00:04:55,875
Definitely. Hey, you think
those girls are still here?

33
00:05:08,361 --> 00:05:12,354
Here we go.
So the Coretex has minimal damage.

34
00:05:12,532 --> 00:05:14,466
There's some calcining
around the edges.

35
00:05:14,967 --> 00:05:19,199
However, the Tempolite has damage
and there's rusting around 300 degrees.

36
00:05:19,371 --> 00:05:22,135
So that means
the Coretex gets the recommend.

37
00:05:22,308 --> 00:05:26,244
See, Em? The best product always wins.

38
00:05:26,645 --> 00:05:27,669
- Oh, Lauren.
- Yes.

39
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,948
I was just wondering if I might skip out
a little bit early for the holiday weekend.

40
00:05:32,117 --> 00:05:34,745
Jerry's taking me to an alpaca farm.

41
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:39,323
Oh, yeah, of course.
It's a holiday. And a weekend.

42
00:05:40,358 --> 00:05:41,757
Yeah, so you should do that.

43
00:05:41,927 --> 00:05:43,451
- Okay.
- Have fun.

44
00:05:43,628 --> 00:05:46,256
- You have fun too.
- I will.

45
00:05:51,703 --> 00:05:54,263
Tuck. FDR.

46
00:05:58,343 --> 00:05:59,867
<i>Six men in the morgue.</i>

47
00:06:00,044 --> 00:06:01,807
A body in the middle of the street.

48
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:05,438
Yes, but to be fair, we did manage to...

49
00:06:05,617 --> 00:06:09,212
- Shut up.
- To... That's me shutting up, right now.

50
00:06:10,188 --> 00:06:12,486
The mission parameters
of the Heinrich case...

51
00:06:12,657 --> 00:06:16,787
...were clearly indicated to be covert.

52
00:06:16,962 --> 00:06:18,554
Thanks to you two geniuses...

53
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:21,824
...Heinrich will be seeking revenge
for his brother's death.

54
00:06:21,999 --> 00:06:23,296
You guys are grounded.

55
00:06:23,701 --> 00:06:25,328
- What?
- Grounded?

56
00:06:39,683 --> 00:06:41,310
<i>And just maybe.</i>

57
00:06:41,486 --> 00:06:42,953
<i>I'm gonna make it.</i>

58
00:06:43,121 --> 00:06:45,248
<i>I'm gonna shake it.</i>

59
00:06:45,422 --> 00:06:47,913
- Hey, Lauren. Lauren. Hey, hey.
- Oh, oh!

60
00:06:48,092 --> 00:06:50,322
Hi, Steve, hey.

61
00:06:50,495 --> 00:06:53,430
- Hey.
- It's Steve.

62
00:06:54,298 --> 00:06:57,699
Yeah. Oh, my... I'm so sorry.
Uh, Lauren, this is Kelly.

63
00:06:57,869 --> 00:06:59,063
- Hi.
- Hi.

64
00:06:59,236 --> 00:07:01,864
- It's very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too, yeah.

65
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:04,735
- Wow, ha, ha, what a big rock.
- Yeah.

66
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,502
My fiancée, yes. Yeah.

67
00:07:07,278 --> 00:07:09,143
- You are engaged?
- Yeah.

68
00:07:09,313 --> 00:07:11,042
To be married.

69
00:07:11,415 --> 00:07:14,543
Things just worked out exactly
how they're supposed to, didn't they?

70
00:07:14,718 --> 00:07:16,242
Yeah. Yeah.

71
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,682
Yes.

72
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:19,948
Looks cool.

73
00:07:20,123 --> 00:07:21,681
Okay, well, you know what?

74
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:26,762
I'm gonna go
because I'm gonna go meet my guy, Ken.

75
00:07:26,931 --> 00:07:28,922
Huh.
- Uh, he's a surgeon.

76
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:30,726
- Wow.
- So, great, well...

77
00:07:30,901 --> 00:07:33,028
...um, congratulations on your ring and...

78
00:07:33,204 --> 00:07:34,728
- Oh, thanks.
- ...and your life...

79
00:07:34,904 --> 00:07:37,668
- ...and your bikes and everything.
- Yeah.

80
00:07:37,841 --> 00:07:40,241
Okay. Well, peace.

81
00:07:40,411 --> 00:07:42,675
- See you.
- Okay. Bye.

82
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:47,213
I just said "peace."
I want to die right now.

83
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,811
Sushi for one.

84
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,493
Hey, Ken.

85
00:07:59,195 --> 00:08:01,561
- The usual?
- Yeah.

86
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:07,264
- Long day, huh?
- You don't know the half of it.

87
00:08:12,609 --> 00:08:14,509
This is too funny.

88
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,145
Hysterical.

89
00:08:18,314 --> 00:08:21,044
I'm sorry. This must be
your boyfriend's seat. Uh, Ken, right?

90
00:08:21,217 --> 00:08:23,310
- Oh, yeah.
- No.

91
00:08:23,486 --> 00:08:27,422
Sushi for one. Yeah. Always for one.

92
00:08:29,626 --> 00:08:32,789
<i>Ugh! It was the most
humiliating moment ever.</i>

93
00:08:32,962 --> 00:08:35,760
Well, because you have to come up
with, like, better excuses.

94
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:39,698
You should've been, "I have a fiancé too.
But he's getting a penile reduction..."

95
00:08:39,869 --> 00:08:43,202
...because his penis is so big
every time it lands like a poltergeist."

96
00:08:43,373 --> 00:08:45,204
Can't think of anything when I see him.

97
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,639
I just can't believe
I gave up everything for him.

98
00:08:47,809 --> 00:08:50,972
It's just, I felt so stupid.
I left my friends, my family...

99
00:08:51,147 --> 00:08:54,878
Don't say that, I'm happy you moved here.
We have a happy life together.

100
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,074
He was my person.

101
00:08:56,251 --> 00:08:59,118
He was your person. You know
what kind of person he ended up?

102
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:02,986
The person that ends up with a girl
that makes out after she eats yellowtail.

103
00:09:03,158 --> 00:09:06,650
I like sushi. She seemed really nice.
She was really pretty.

104
00:09:07,063 --> 00:09:10,999
Well, I don't give a shit about her.
I give a shit about you and your love life.

105
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,827
I'm going out, dating, meeting guys.

106
00:09:13,002 --> 00:09:16,529
Oh, please, you're not... You date,
but you're not taking it seriously.

107
00:09:16,705 --> 00:09:20,072
Don't use that brand, it leaves a film.
That one's much more effective.

108
00:09:20,242 --> 00:09:22,107
I wish you would act like that
with men.

109
00:09:22,278 --> 00:09:25,645
You can choose a laundry detergent,
but you can't choose a guy you want...

110
00:09:25,814 --> 00:09:28,806
That's my job. It's easier.
There's charts, there's numbers.

111
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,954
That's why you start online dating.
They have lots of charts.

112
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,486
- Not that again.
- What is your problem with online?

113
00:09:34,656 --> 00:09:36,715
What's my problem?
Do you watch <i>Dateline?</i>

114
00:09:36,893 --> 00:09:38,326
How many creeps are out there?

115
00:09:38,493 --> 00:09:41,087
I could end up a skin suit
or in somebody's trunk.

116
00:09:41,263 --> 00:09:44,699
Uh, that's a little dramatic, okay?
That happens to, like, one in 20 girls.

117
00:09:44,867 --> 00:09:47,358
You're not gonna end up in a trunk.
If you're lucky...

118
00:09:47,536 --> 00:09:50,403
...somebody will end up in your trunk.
That's your trunk.

119
00:09:50,572 --> 00:09:51,596
Ha, ha. Stop.

120
00:09:51,773 --> 00:09:53,707
You need to get back out there, okay?

121
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:57,072
Yeah, sure, you might make a mistake
and end up with the wrong guy...

122
00:09:57,245 --> 00:10:00,681
...but you might end up meeting
the right guy. So isn't that worth it?

123
00:10:00,849 --> 00:10:03,079
What is the worst thing
that could happen?

124
00:10:03,251 --> 00:10:06,482
Skin suit. Skin suit's pretty bad.

125
00:10:11,393 --> 00:10:13,224
Thank you for having me
to your nana's.

126
00:10:13,395 --> 00:10:16,125
Are you kidding me? You're
my best friend. We're family.

127
00:10:16,297 --> 00:10:17,696
Oh, my God.

128
00:10:18,066 --> 00:10:20,125
- This is gluten-free. Try a taste.
- Hm?

129
00:10:20,302 --> 00:10:23,703
Why the heck are you two sitting over here
all by yourselves?

130
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:26,499
You're not gonna make me
any great-grandbabies this way.

131
00:10:26,675 --> 00:10:28,302
It is a family gathering, Nana.

132
00:10:28,477 --> 00:10:31,002
I don't think you want us
making any great-grandbabies.

133
00:10:31,178 --> 00:10:35,239
To be fair, I have already provided you
with a wonderful great-grandchild.

134
00:10:35,417 --> 00:10:38,113
Yeah, but that doesn't count
because you screwed it all up.

135
00:10:39,353 --> 00:10:41,548
- Ouch.
- Come on, Lil.

136
00:10:43,425 --> 00:10:45,620
Let's show these kids
how it's done, huh?

137
00:10:45,893 --> 00:10:47,986
- Heh, heh. See?
<i>- Ciao.</i>

138
00:10:51,232 --> 00:10:52,893
It's kind of gross when they kiss.

139
00:10:58,439 --> 00:11:00,634
God, I love that kid.

140
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:03,836
What's going on?

141
00:11:04,278 --> 00:11:07,076
Hey, Mr. Deep-ln-Thought.
You wanna talk about it?

142
00:11:07,248 --> 00:11:09,739
I was just...
That kind of thing's lovely, isn't it?

143
00:11:09,917 --> 00:11:11,942
- It's really lovely.
- What's lovely?

144
00:11:12,119 --> 00:11:14,952
I love the way
they look into each other's eyes like that.

145
00:11:15,122 --> 00:11:17,249
I'm pretty sure that's the cataracts.

146
00:11:17,425 --> 00:11:20,724
Have you... Okay. You asked me
a serious question, didn't you?

147
00:11:20,895 --> 00:11:23,420
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Right. So do you want a serious answer?

148
00:11:23,597 --> 00:11:25,121
- Yeah. Put the cake down?
- Please.

149
00:11:25,299 --> 00:11:26,323
- Okay.
- Thank you.

150
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,899
Cake is down. Talk to me.

151
00:11:29,069 --> 00:11:31,264
- Well, no, seriously, man chat. Okay?
- Okay.

152
00:11:31,439 --> 00:11:32,838
Man to man.

153
00:11:33,474 --> 00:11:35,601
I trust you.
I know you'd do anything for me.

154
00:11:35,775 --> 00:11:37,709
- Yeah.
- You would take a bullet for me.

155
00:11:37,878 --> 00:11:40,278
I would for you as well, you know that.
Right?

156
00:11:40,448 --> 00:11:44,942
- Can you imagine all of that?
- Yes.

157
00:11:45,119 --> 00:11:51,388
Can you imagine what that would be like
to share with a woman?

158
00:11:51,858 --> 00:11:52,882
No.

159
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,084
Okay.

160
00:11:54,261 --> 00:11:55,353
No.

161
00:11:55,529 --> 00:11:56,860
Thank you.

162
00:12:15,181 --> 00:12:17,547
All right, Joe, Steven, you're up.

163
00:12:18,918 --> 00:12:21,751
- All right, Joe. Good luck, son.
- Let's go to war.

164
00:12:21,921 --> 00:12:24,082
That's it. Now you feint. Nice feint.

165
00:12:24,257 --> 00:12:26,418
Hit.
- Oh, nice. Get on him. Oh!

166
00:12:26,726 --> 00:12:29,024
Down he goes. Ground and pound him.

167
00:12:29,195 --> 00:12:31,425
Get on him. Ground and pound.
Ground and pound.

168
00:12:31,598 --> 00:12:33,156
- Uh....
- Keep it going. Hammerfist him.

169
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,995
Right there, that's it.
Hit it. He's giving you his back.

170
00:12:36,169 --> 00:12:37,898
- Rear naked choke.
- I give.

171
00:12:38,071 --> 00:12:42,007
- Yes. He's tapping. He's out. Booyah!
- I give.

172
00:12:42,275 --> 00:12:44,505
See what I mean?
That's how it works, boy.

173
00:12:44,677 --> 00:12:46,269
See that? I pwned him, didn't I?

174
00:12:46,446 --> 00:12:48,346
- Good. You okay?
- Sure did, son.

175
00:12:48,514 --> 00:12:49,640
Ha, ha!

176
00:12:49,816 --> 00:12:52,444
- That's how you kill him.
- What are you doing here?

177
00:12:52,785 --> 00:12:56,551
Well, I had a bit of time off and
I thought I'd come hang with my homey.

178
00:12:57,123 --> 00:12:58,215
I got creamed.

179
00:12:58,391 --> 00:13:00,621
No, you didn't,
that's just a matter of opinion.

180
00:13:00,793 --> 00:13:02,283
What do you know about fighting?

181
00:13:02,461 --> 00:13:04,759
You're just a travel agent.

182
00:13:04,931 --> 00:13:08,924
I know enough to know
that he who hesitates...

183
00:13:13,106 --> 00:13:14,505
Pain?

184
00:13:14,674 --> 00:13:18,940
That's just weakness leaving the body.

185
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,915
Oh, Dad.

186
00:13:26,084 --> 00:13:28,109
Joe. Joe, Joe.

187
00:13:28,287 --> 00:13:31,120
- Come on, boys.
- Mom, did you see me win today?

188
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:32,757
On the mat? That's amazing.

189
00:13:32,925 --> 00:13:35,393
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

190
00:13:35,928 --> 00:13:38,123
- Hey, bud.
- Hi.

191
00:13:38,664 --> 00:13:40,723
- Hey, Tuck.
- Hey, how you doing?

192
00:13:40,899 --> 00:13:41,991
Didn't know you were in.

193
00:13:42,167 --> 00:13:44,601
Got a couple days off
so I thought I'd come see Joe.

194
00:13:44,771 --> 00:13:48,263
You're the only travel agent I've ever met
who actually travels for his job.

195
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,839
Yeah.

196
00:13:50,609 --> 00:13:53,635
Um, so I was thinking that maybe, um....

197
00:13:54,546 --> 00:13:58,312
Maybe you, me and Joe,
we could all go out together...

198
00:13:58,483 --> 00:14:00,917
...you know, as a family,
maybe get something to eat.

199
00:14:01,086 --> 00:14:03,953
Have a meal.
I think that would be really, really good.

200
00:14:04,122 --> 00:14:05,817
I have a date tonight, Tuck.

201
00:14:05,991 --> 00:14:08,016
So maybe some other time.

202
00:14:08,192 --> 00:14:11,025
Sure. That's great. Good. That's good.

203
00:14:13,365 --> 00:14:15,094
Bye, Joe.

204
00:14:19,471 --> 00:14:22,133
So good.

205
00:14:22,673 --> 00:14:23,970
<i>Do you believe it?</i>

206
00:14:24,141 --> 00:14:27,338

00:14:27,512 --> 00:14:31,608
<i>What an amazing end
to this first half of play.</i>

208

to start a life with?</i>

219
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,742
That's just so sad.

220
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:16,282
Good morning, Ella.
- Good morning.

221
00:15:16,661 --> 00:15:19,357
Here she comes. Here she comes.
- Hi, there.

222
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:22,260
- Looking good, boss.
- What?

223
00:15:25,169 --> 00:15:28,002
- Hi, Paul.
- What? Nothing.

224
00:15:30,141 --> 00:15:32,735
- Good morning, Hudson.
- I'm down, girl.

225
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,673
I'm down too.

226
00:15:34,844 --> 00:15:37,005
Emily. What am I down with?

227
00:15:37,181 --> 00:15:38,944
Oh, my goodness. It's a....

228
00:15:39,116 --> 00:15:41,676
Your... Check your desktop.

229
00:15:47,925 --> 00:15:49,586
Oh, crap.

230
00:15:52,195 --> 00:15:54,425
- Hi.
<i>Bi-curious? Skinny-dipping?</i>

231
00:15:54,598 --> 00:15:56,896
Rollerblading?
I mean, what is this, 1994?

232
00:15:57,067 --> 00:16:00,628
You looked adorable in those shorts.
Men are gonna respond to that camel toe.

233
00:16:00,804 --> 00:16:02,294
I'm gonna kill you, Trish.

234
00:16:02,473 --> 00:16:03,770
Uh, how about "thank you"?

235
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,966
My office thinks I clean my house
in a naughty nurse costume.

236
00:16:07,143 --> 00:16:09,475
That's fine.
That means you're open to role-paying.

237
00:16:09,647 --> 00:16:12,741
We're trying to cast a wide net.
We don't know what guys you like.

238
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:15,612
You've got me in a keg stand
looking for a relationship.

239
00:16:15,785 --> 00:16:18,219
- I don't even know what that means.
- You're flexible.

240
00:16:18,388 --> 00:16:21,186
Guys wanna know that you're flexible
and good at gymnastics.

241
00:16:21,357 --> 00:16:23,325
No, no, that's Mommy's special milk,
okay?

242
00:16:23,493 --> 00:16:25,927
Just get me off this thing.
How do I cancel it?

243
00:16:26,096 --> 00:16:28,394
<i>You're not canceling it.
I'm in charge of that.</i>

244
00:16:28,865 --> 00:16:31,425
Wait a second. Who is that?

245
00:16:33,136 --> 00:16:35,195
Oh, my God. He's cute.

246
00:16:35,371 --> 00:16:38,465
Let me get this straight.
You put your personal, private details...

247
00:16:38,641 --> 00:16:40,632
- ...on a very public website?
- Yes.

248
00:16:40,809 --> 00:16:42,834
- Are you insane?
- No.

249
00:16:43,012 --> 00:16:45,071
- Where you taking her?
- Don't do that to me.

250
00:16:45,248 --> 00:16:48,115
- Taking her to the Blarney Stone.
- I like the jukebox.

251
00:16:48,283 --> 00:16:50,217
- You're such a cheeseball.
- What?

252
00:16:50,386 --> 00:16:53,150
You're gonna go on this date
and I'm gonna go with you.

253
00:16:53,323 --> 00:16:54,881
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

254
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:57,355
I'm scared.
You haven't done this in a long time.

255
00:16:57,527 --> 00:16:59,392
This girl could be all sorts of crazy.

256
00:16:59,562 --> 00:17:02,122
And, besides,
half those girls pee standing up, Tuck.

257
00:17:02,297 --> 00:17:05,164
The other half
are on one of our watch lists.

258
00:17:05,335 --> 00:17:07,929
- It's a date.
- Look, lucky for you, I'm free tonight.

259
00:17:08,104 --> 00:17:10,538
And I'm gonna bring the binoculars,
the hand cream...

260
00:17:10,706 --> 00:17:13,231
...keep a hundred-yard radius.
It'll be sweet stuff.

261
00:17:13,409 --> 00:17:16,469
No, you can't bring the binoculars.
You're not watching my date.

262
00:17:16,645 --> 00:17:17,839
I need a little privacy.

263
00:17:18,013 --> 00:17:21,278
I'll be around the corner on ringtone.
I'll be at the video store.

264
00:17:21,451 --> 00:17:25,444
One ring means you need an extraction,
two, a cleaner, three, I can get home.

265
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:28,579
- Two hundred yards.
- Sold.

266
00:17:36,498 --> 00:17:39,160
Tuck? Are you Tuck?

267
00:17:41,236 --> 00:17:43,170
Hi. I'm Lauren.

268
00:17:43,338 --> 00:17:44,965
Oh, my gosh. Hello. How are you?

269
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,198
Very nice to meet you.

270
00:17:47,242 --> 00:17:48,732
You too. Um....

271
00:17:49,711 --> 00:17:53,169
Please, sit. Please, sorry. Yeah.

272
00:17:55,517 --> 00:17:58,418
Wow, it's like...
You are really, really beautiful.

273
00:17:58,587 --> 00:18:01,988
Could you say that a few more times,
because your voice is amazing. Ha, ha.

274
00:18:03,425 --> 00:18:06,986
I feel like I need to apologize again
for that bizarre profile.

275
00:18:07,161 --> 00:18:09,095
- No, no, no.
- My friend, Trish, is....

276
00:18:09,264 --> 00:18:12,324
Oh, no. Everybody should have a friend
who's a spaz.

277
00:18:12,501 --> 00:18:15,368
- I think I'm going to have to kill her.
- Well, actually...

278
00:18:15,536 --> 00:18:17,936
- ...I might be able to help you.
- I'm kidding.

279
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:20,065
- So am I.
<i>- Love...</i>

280
00:18:20,242 --> 00:18:23,370
<i>...is the only thing
that can save this poor creature.</i>

281
00:18:23,544 --> 00:18:26,877
<i>And I am going to convince him
that he is loved...</i>

282
00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:30,212
<i>...even at the cost of my own life.</i>

283
00:18:30,384 --> 00:18:34,878
<i>No matter what you hear in there,
no matter how cruelly I beg you...</i>

284
00:18:35,057 --> 00:18:37,389
<i>- ...no matter how terribly I may scream...</i>
- Hi.

285
00:18:39,227 --> 00:18:43,561
<i>...do not open this door or
you will undo everything I've worked for.</i>

286
00:18:44,699 --> 00:18:46,166
Good for you, pal.

287
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:48,564
So tell me one thing
that's not on your profile.

288
00:18:48,903 --> 00:18:50,393
Um....

289
00:18:50,571 --> 00:18:51,595
I have a son.

290
00:18:51,772 --> 00:18:54,366
- Oh, you do?
- Yeah. He's called Joe.

291
00:18:54,542 --> 00:18:58,205
He's 7 and he's really lovely.
Really lovely.

292
00:18:58,479 --> 00:19:00,379
And his mom?

293
00:19:00,548 --> 00:19:01,913
Couldn't work.

294
00:19:03,651 --> 00:19:05,243
How about you?

295
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,520
- No kids that I know of.
- Okay.

296
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:08,780
And no ex-wives.

297
00:19:10,157 --> 00:19:13,149
- I have a very important question to ask.
- Good. Go on.

298
00:19:13,327 --> 00:19:16,626
Have you ever been or do you
ever plan on being a serial killer?

299
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:20,000
Well, I mean, it's...
You gotta keep your options open.

300
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,157
- But, no.
- Okay, good answer. Ha-ha-ha.

301
00:19:24,505 --> 00:19:27,303
So you've never killed anybody
with your bare hands.

302
00:19:27,707 --> 00:19:29,140
Not this week.

303
00:19:29,644 --> 00:19:30,668
Great.

304
00:19:31,178 --> 00:19:33,908
- Lauren, you're incredible.
- You're not so bad yourself.

305
00:19:35,348 --> 00:19:39,614
All right, I'm gonna go and rent a movie
and take a cold shower.

306
00:19:39,787 --> 00:19:41,118
- I will too.
- Okay.

307
00:19:41,289 --> 00:19:43,917
- And wait for your call for the next...
- Five minutes?

308
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,752
<i>This is where it all started.</i>

309
00:19:47,929 --> 00:19:50,591
<i>Yes, I was standing over there
by that desk.</i>

310
00:19:50,764 --> 00:19:54,598
<i>No, you were sitting in the chair. And
suddenly, you started walking toward me.</i>

311
00:19:54,769 --> 00:19:56,896
<i>Very slowly. Very slowly.</i>

312
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,469
<i>I could count every step.</i>

313
00:19:58,638 --> 00:20:00,902
<i>And when you're walking towards me
very slowly...</i>

314
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:04,066
<i>...I thought, "What's the matter with him?
Can't he walk faster?"</i>

315
00:20:05,879 --> 00:20:07,870
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Oh, I'm sorry. You take it.

316
00:20:08,048 --> 00:20:10,175
- No, no, no, that's okay. You take it.
- Sure?

317
00:20:10,351 --> 00:20:13,843
You're not gonna like it. Twist ending.
You'll see it coming a mile away.

318
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:18,657
- And how would you know what I like?
- I know movies. And women.

319
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:21,587
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

320
00:20:22,395 --> 00:20:23,953
Okay.

321
00:20:24,464 --> 00:20:26,864
Well, then,
why don't you tell me what I want?

322
00:20:29,469 --> 00:20:31,699
<i>- The Lady Vanishes?</i> Why is that?
- Mm-hm.

323
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:34,965
Well, firstly, you can never go wrong
with Hitchcock. Ever.

324
00:20:35,141 --> 00:20:37,905
It's got comedy, drama, romance,
it's a thriller.

325
00:20:38,078 --> 00:20:39,773
It's classy, but not stuffy.

326
00:20:39,945 --> 00:20:44,245
A little obscure, so if you haven't seen it,
you'll thank me for introducing you to it.

327
00:20:44,417 --> 00:20:47,545
If you have,
you'll know what a good choice it was.

328
00:20:48,721 --> 00:20:50,484
- Well, I have seen it.
- Mm-hm.

329
00:20:50,657 --> 00:20:52,591
- And it is a really good choice.
- Mm.

330
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:56,593
However, not as good as Rebecca,
<i>Notorious, Vertigo...</i>

331
00:20:56,762 --> 00:20:59,856
...or pretty much any of his films
from 1960 to 1972.

332
00:21:00,033 --> 00:21:03,730
In fact, it's sort of a second-tier title.

333
00:21:03,902 --> 00:21:05,699
A second.

334
00:21:05,872 --> 00:21:09,069
- You know what? Scratch...
- Look, I see you surveying the prospects.

335
00:21:09,241 --> 00:21:12,233
That one over there in Foreign?
Too much angst.

336
00:21:12,411 --> 00:21:15,175
This one in the sweater set,
picking out animated movies?

337
00:21:15,348 --> 00:21:17,976
That girl will have your children named
before breakfast.

338
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:20,641
The problem is,
no one looks like a clean getaway.

339
00:21:20,819 --> 00:21:23,754
I get it. You come in here
looking for a girl renting a movie.

340
00:21:23,922 --> 00:21:27,187
Clearly, she doesn't have a date
for the night. We're easy targets.

341
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:29,919
You look like the guy
interested in a one-day rental...

342
00:21:30,096 --> 00:21:33,031
...if you know what I mean.
If you knew anything about women...

343
00:21:33,198 --> 00:21:37,658
...or anything about me, I'm perfectly
capable of choosing my own movies.

344
00:21:37,836 --> 00:21:39,269
But thanks.

345
00:21:39,438 --> 00:21:41,201
Happy hunting.

346
00:21:44,043 --> 00:21:45,408
Hm.

347
00:21:47,613 --> 00:21:50,446
So, sir, you want me to hack
into a video store database?

348
00:21:50,616 --> 00:21:53,483
- It's for the Heinrich case.
<i>- Searching database.</i>

349
00:21:56,321 --> 00:21:58,312
All right, keep on scrolling.

350
00:21:58,557 --> 00:22:00,320
Wait. Stop. Scroll back.

351
00:22:00,925 --> 00:22:01,949
That's her.

352
00:22:04,129 --> 00:22:06,996
Sir,
how is this girl connected to Heinrich?

353
00:22:07,165 --> 00:22:09,429
That's G-4 classified.

354
00:22:10,035 --> 00:22:14,131
Hello, everybody, I'm Lauren Scott.
Thank you so much for being here today.

355
00:22:14,305 --> 00:22:16,000
Good morning, Lauren.

356
00:22:16,274 --> 00:22:19,971
We're here today to talk about grills.
Does anybody have any first impressions?

357
00:22:20,145 --> 00:22:21,737
I like the rotisserie feature.

358
00:22:22,146 --> 00:22:23,579
Perfect. That's very helpful.

359
00:22:23,748 --> 00:22:25,579
I don't think it heated up fast enough.

360
00:22:25,918 --> 00:22:30,355
Like something was wrong with the motor,
maybe the spark was dead.

361
00:22:30,621 --> 00:22:33,021
Actually, sir,
there's nothing wrong with the spark.

362
00:22:33,191 --> 00:22:37,093
Some people think grills just burst
into flames at the slightest touch.

363
00:22:37,261 --> 00:22:38,455
It doesn't work like that.

364
00:22:40,131 --> 00:22:41,962
Does anybody have any useful opinions?

365
00:22:42,468 --> 00:22:44,868
- I thought the lid was hard to handle.
- Mm-hm.

366
00:22:45,203 --> 00:22:47,467
Ugh. The lids, what a pain, right?

367
00:22:47,738 --> 00:22:52,971
I just felt the whole thing to be a bit
stiff, uptight, not really user-friendly.

368
00:22:53,144 --> 00:22:55,169
- I think it depends on the user.
- Mm.

369
00:22:55,713 --> 00:22:58,181
It so happens I have a lot of experience
with grills.

370
00:22:58,349 --> 00:23:01,216
I'm something of a grill master.

371
00:23:01,686 --> 00:23:05,383
Uh, this is a sophisticated grill. Not sure
you've dealt with one of those before.

372
00:23:05,556 --> 00:23:09,287
Or maybe a grill like this
is just so scared of being burned...

373
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:12,987
...it stays on simmer
and never really heats up all the way.

374
00:23:13,163 --> 00:23:16,655
- Don't touch my grill.
- I don't think this can handle a guy like me.

375
00:23:16,834 --> 00:23:18,028
- I think it could.
- Really?

376
00:23:18,202 --> 00:23:20,864
- Easily.
- Prove it. 8 p.m. Barcelona. Tomorrow.

377
00:23:21,037 --> 00:23:22,629
I don't think so.

378
00:23:22,807 --> 00:23:25,776
I guess I could stick around a
little longer, talk about grills.

379
00:23:25,943 --> 00:23:28,411
Charcoal or gas,
number 19, what do you think?

380
00:23:28,578 --> 00:23:30,910
If I say yes, will you leave?
This is my job.

381
00:23:31,215 --> 00:23:33,080
- Eight p.m. tomorrow.
- Fine.

382
00:23:33,751 --> 00:23:36,549
- Fine.
- Fine.

383
00:23:40,258 --> 00:23:42,055
You smell nice.

384
00:23:43,727 --> 00:23:44,751
Bye.

385
00:23:53,337 --> 00:23:55,237
What were you doing on the computer?
Porn?

386
00:23:55,406 --> 00:23:58,204
- I have a photograph of my girl.
- I was doing the same thing.

387
00:23:58,375 --> 00:24:01,538
- A background check.
- I don't know if that's creepy or romantic.

388
00:24:02,113 --> 00:24:04,172
"Cromantic." I do it all the time.
Wanna see?

389
00:24:04,347 --> 00:24:06,076
- Yeah, sure. Wanna see her?
- Yeah.

390
00:24:06,249 --> 00:24:08,217
I bet yours has got antlers and howls.

391
00:24:08,385 --> 00:24:10,785
She does,
but she's incredibly attractive with them.

392
00:24:10,954 --> 00:24:12,353
- She's a 10.
- Go on three.

393
00:24:12,522 --> 00:24:14,114
One, two, three and go? All right.

394
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:15,588
- Okay. I'll sound off.
- Okay.

395
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:17,386
- One...
- One.

396
00:24:17,894 --> 00:24:19,589
...two, three.

397
00:24:24,568 --> 00:24:26,559
- That's, uh, Lauren S...
- Lauren? Lauren Scott?

398
00:24:26,736 --> 00:24:27,828
Scott.

399
00:24:28,004 --> 00:24:33,636
- That's the girl from the video store?
- Right around the corner from the bar.

400
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:36,404
Oh, wow. Um....

401
00:24:37,614 --> 00:24:41,675
- I had no idea.
- Of course. How could you know that?

402
00:24:41,851 --> 00:24:45,048
Did she, ahem, actually say she wanted
to go out on a date with you, though?

403
00:24:45,222 --> 00:24:48,919
You know what? I'm gonna make this really
easy. I'm gonna bow out. You date her.

404
00:24:49,091 --> 00:24:51,616
Hang on. Did she say
she wanted to go out with you?

405
00:24:51,795 --> 00:24:54,286
It doesn't matter.
I love you. You're my best friend.

406
00:24:54,463 --> 00:24:57,023
- Yeah.
- You go date her.

407
00:24:57,467 --> 00:24:59,935
Yeah, if I got in the picture,
it wouldn't be fair.

408
00:25:00,103 --> 00:25:01,832
Well, I'm sorry. What does that mean?

409
00:25:03,439 --> 00:25:05,873
- What does that mean?
- I mean, come on, man...

410
00:25:06,042 --> 00:25:08,010
...you're not out there as much as I am.

411
00:25:08,178 --> 00:25:09,668
And like anything...

412
00:25:10,646 --> 00:25:12,910
- ... practice makes, uh...
- Perfect?

413
00:25:13,082 --> 00:25:14,674
- No, no, no.
- You're perfect?

414
00:25:14,851 --> 00:25:17,479
Maybe not perfect,
but damn near close...

415
00:25:17,786 --> 00:25:18,810
Wow.

416
00:25:19,388 --> 00:25:22,152
- ...to perfect.
- You believe that as well?

417
00:25:22,325 --> 00:25:25,419
- You don't have to bow out because of me.
- I don't?

418
00:25:25,594 --> 00:25:28,654
I'm not concerned that she's gonna
fall in love with you, pal.

419
00:25:29,733 --> 00:25:32,327
- How very nice of you. Thank you.
- You are welcome.

420
00:25:32,968 --> 00:25:34,492
So do your thing.

421
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:35,762
Whatever that is.

422
00:25:35,938 --> 00:25:37,599
And, um...

423
00:25:37,973 --> 00:25:39,338
...just let her decide.

424
00:25:39,508 --> 00:25:41,305
- Sure.
- Yeah.

425
00:25:42,111 --> 00:25:43,544
Yeah.

426
00:25:46,248 --> 00:25:48,648
While we're at it,
why don't we put ground rules in?

427
00:25:48,817 --> 00:25:50,648
- We should.
- One, I don't think...

428
00:25:50,819 --> 00:25:54,016
- ...we should tell we know each other.
- Two, stay out of each other's way.

429
00:25:54,189 --> 00:25:57,181
Three. Yeah.
No hanky-panky, no hanky-panky.

430
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:59,623
God, you have not dated
in a long time, have you?

431
00:26:00,662 --> 00:26:03,062
And if this ever starts
to affect our friendship...

432
00:26:03,232 --> 00:26:05,393
- Which it won't.
- ...which it won't...

433
00:26:06,668 --> 00:26:09,000
- ...then we walk away.
- Done.

434
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:12,298
- So, then, we have... We have...
- We have a gentleman's agreement.

435
00:26:12,474 --> 00:26:15,136
- A gentleman's agreement. We do.
- May the best man win.

436
00:26:15,476 --> 00:26:17,467
The best man for her.

437
00:26:17,646 --> 00:26:19,136
- For her.
- For the lady.

438
00:26:19,315 --> 00:26:21,476
For the lady, for her,
the best man for her.

439
00:26:36,998 --> 00:26:38,363
Oh! Uh....

440
00:26:38,566 --> 00:26:40,557
Forgive me, sir. You startled me.

441
00:26:40,735 --> 00:26:43,260
I understand you're Savile Row's finest.

442
00:26:43,438 --> 00:26:44,632
We do our best, sir.

443
00:26:44,806 --> 00:26:48,674
In that case,
I'd like to have a suit in this fabric.

444
00:26:49,477 --> 00:26:53,106
Ah, South American vicuña.
An excellent choice indeed.

445
00:26:53,481 --> 00:26:56,780
One thing with my suits,
I like to know they are one of a kind.

446
00:26:56,951 --> 00:26:59,249
I wouldn't want anyone
wearing the same suit.

447
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:03,550
- I'm sure you understand that.
- Of course, sir. With this fabric and color...

448
00:27:03,725 --> 00:27:07,422
...I only made one other, and that was
for a gentleman who lives quite far away.

449
00:27:07,595 --> 00:27:08,755
How far exactly?

450
00:27:09,097 --> 00:27:10,189
Los Angeles.

451
00:27:10,365 --> 00:27:12,196
Have you any reason to go there soon?

452
00:27:13,367 --> 00:27:15,164
I do now.

453
00:27:18,973 --> 00:27:22,101
<i> Hello. Sorry, I'm not in.

Tuck, Tuck.

456
00:27:26,013 --> 00:27:28,106
Where are you, man? Five o'clock.

457
00:27:28,281 --> 00:27:31,910
<i>CHiPs</i> marathon about to start,
I got new sticks for "Rock Band."

458
00:27:32,086 --> 00:27:33,485
Call me.

459
00:27:35,722 --> 00:27:38,088
- My God, I love these places.
- I thought you might.

460
00:27:38,259 --> 00:27:40,591
We're not gonna leave
until we've spent our tokens.

461
00:27:40,762 --> 00:27:43,890
<i>Hello. I'm sorry, I'm not in.

463
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,567
Dude, where are you?

464
00:27:51,805 --> 00:27:53,568
Oh!

465
00:27:54,208 --> 00:27:58,838
Hey, man, uh, it's about 5:43. Uh....

466
00:27:59,479 --> 00:28:03,643
So whatever, man, just hanging out,
watching the thing.

467
00:28:03,817 --> 00:28:06,911
Are you...? Maybe your phone's turned off
or something.

468
00:28:07,087 --> 00:28:10,250
But check it to make... Clearly, you
can't check it and see if it...

469
00:28:10,424 --> 00:28:11,982
Whatever. Call me.

470
00:28:12,993 --> 00:28:15,154
So the great air hockey cheats, that is.

471
00:28:15,328 --> 00:28:17,819
I'm available for lessons anytime.

472
00:28:19,199 --> 00:28:20,257
But only for you.

473
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,205
There's something else
I wanna show you.

474
00:28:29,376 --> 00:28:31,469
<i>I'll get back to you as soon as possible.</i>

475
00:28:31,645 --> 00:28:36,048
Hey, man, so, uh, I'm a little worried.
I don't know if, um...

476
00:28:36,483 --> 00:28:39,850
You haven't returned my calls
for, like, a long time now, like an hour.

477
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:44,922
So, uh, just give me a call
if you're okay, okay?

478
00:28:45,091 --> 00:28:48,026
Okay.
I've said "okay" now, like, five times.

479
00:28:48,194 --> 00:28:50,389
Give me a call. Oka...

480
00:28:50,564 --> 00:28:52,327
Okay, where are we going?

481
00:28:52,499 --> 00:28:54,091
There are lions in here.
- No.

482
00:28:54,266 --> 00:28:57,667
- Yes.
- Are you serious?

483
00:28:58,371 --> 00:29:00,532
Okay. Open them.

484
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:05,536
Wow, it's so beautiful.

485
00:29:06,379 --> 00:29:07,812
Come on.

486
00:29:08,214 --> 00:29:09,909
We're going up there?

487
00:29:12,017 --> 00:29:13,882
- You're gonna catch me, right?
- Yeah.

488
00:29:14,054 --> 00:29:15,544
Promise?
- Absolutely.

489
00:29:15,855 --> 00:29:17,755
- Okay.
- One...

490
00:29:18,057 --> 00:29:19,081
Yeah.

491
00:29:21,193 --> 00:29:22,626
...two...

492
00:29:23,963 --> 00:29:25,362
...three.

493
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,793
There you go.

494
00:29:30,302 --> 00:29:31,428
Oh, my gosh.

495
00:29:34,306 --> 00:29:36,433
- Okay, okay.
- Right.

496
00:29:48,854 --> 00:29:51,687
- What was that?
- I'm sorry, I lost my grip.

497
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:54,120
You did that on purpose.

498
00:29:54,493 --> 00:29:56,461
Uh.... Maybe I did.

499
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:57,887
I think you did.

500
00:29:58,063 --> 00:30:00,793
Well, sometimes falling is the best part.

501
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:14,636
Come on.

502
00:30:14,812 --> 00:30:17,406
- Yeah.
- I'm coming.

503
00:30:20,085 --> 00:30:21,609
<i>Me so horny.</i>

504
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:25,345
Hold on.

505
00:30:26,225 --> 00:30:28,750
- Hello.
<i>- Hey, it's me. Can you talk?</i>

506
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:30,792
- Yeah, what's up?
<i>- It's... I don't know.</i>

507
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:35,092
<i>- I feel weird about dating two guys at once.</i>
- Don't feel bad about dating two guys.

508
00:30:35,267 --> 00:30:38,327
<i>This is good, okay?
You gotta go out there and live a life...</i>

509
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,130
...for women like me who can't...

510
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:43,741
...who have to have sex with the same guy
every Wednesday night at 9:00...

511
00:30:43,908 --> 00:30:46,604
- ...while we're eating Cheetos.
- That's kind of awesome.

512
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:47,938
It is awesome.

513
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:49,741
For women everywhere.

514
00:30:49,915 --> 00:30:53,248
That's the spirit. Do it.
And Bob's super horny, I gotta go.

515
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:54,678
Okay. Bye.

516
00:30:54,852 --> 00:30:58,083
Okay. For women everywhere.
I love it, I love it, I love it.

517
00:30:58,556 --> 00:30:59,989
<i>Me love you long time.</i>

518
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,521
Tuck.

519
00:31:04,695 --> 00:31:05,957
Where's your partner?

520
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:08,928
- Oh, he went out on a date.
- Of course he did.

521
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,536
The guy's an assassin, slays everything
he sets his sights on, right?

522
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:17,766
<i>We got a positive lock
on that license plate.</i>

523
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:20,274
- Do you want us to put it up?
- Yes.

524
00:31:20,444 --> 00:31:22,878
No. Actually, no, don't.

525
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:26,507
- Yeah, go on. If you would, thanks, yeah.
- Okay.

526
00:31:26,683 --> 00:31:28,844
No. No, we can't.

527
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:33,080
Yeah. You gotta do it now. Go on.

528
00:31:33,257 --> 00:31:34,315
- I'm here now.
- Okay.

529
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:47,594
Wow.

530
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:51,104
- I wasn't sure if you were gonna show.
- I told you I could handle it.

531
00:31:51,274 --> 00:31:52,536
We'll see. Come on.

532
00:31:52,709 --> 00:31:55,701
- Oh, I don't wanna lose my spot.
- Don't worry about it.

533
00:31:56,446 --> 00:31:57,970
After you.

534
00:31:58,181 --> 00:31:59,580
Go ahead.

535
00:32:00,784 --> 00:32:01,910
Let them through.

536
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:03,917
- Good to see you, buddy.
- How you doing?

537
00:32:04,087 --> 00:32:07,215
You'll gonna love this place, I swear.
Hey, Ciera. How are you?

538
00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:12,722
I think you're enjoying yourself. You just
have to loosen up. Get off the simmer.

539
00:32:12,896 --> 00:32:13,954
Nathaniel.

540
00:32:14,131 --> 00:32:15,962
What's up, baby? How you been?

541
00:32:16,133 --> 00:32:17,998
Look at you. Oh!

542
00:32:20,137 --> 00:32:23,106
You are shining like a bright light.

543
00:32:23,273 --> 00:32:26,640
You guys are here? Come on.

544
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:29,472
All right, I gotta go say hi to the DJ.
He knows me.

545
00:32:29,646 --> 00:32:33,241
Come on. Come on in.
Come on. Come on.

546
00:32:33,416 --> 00:32:35,043
What's up?

547
00:32:35,385 --> 00:32:37,512
After you, my lady.

548
00:32:39,121 --> 00:32:41,646
'85 Veuve, Sammy.

549
00:32:52,803 --> 00:32:54,361
Hey. Where are you going?

550
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:57,632
- Where are you going? We just got here.
- You know what?

551
00:32:57,807 --> 00:33:00,367
- I'm not the girl for you.
- Oh, come on, just...

552
00:33:00,544 --> 00:33:02,569
Come inside, we'll have a good time.

553
00:33:02,745 --> 00:33:04,440
It's really okay. I've done this.

554
00:33:04,613 --> 00:33:07,741
I was a gymnast in high school,
my best event was the keg stand.

555
00:33:08,284 --> 00:33:10,411
- You're a gymnast?
- Unbelievable.

556
00:33:10,586 --> 00:33:13,419
It's valid. You said you were a gymnast,
I asked a question.

557
00:33:13,589 --> 00:33:15,250
That's exactly why I'm walking away.

558
00:33:15,424 --> 00:33:18,222
Because you're uptight
and don't know how to have good time?

559
00:33:18,394 --> 00:33:21,261
You have the emotional intelligence
of a 15-year-old boy.

560
00:33:22,765 --> 00:33:26,496
You think I'd be interested in going out
with you or going back up in the club?

561
00:33:26,669 --> 00:33:28,637
- I don't think so.
- Thank you, princess.

562
00:33:29,171 --> 00:33:31,833
- Can we call it a night?
- Can we please call it a night?

563
00:33:32,007 --> 00:33:33,338
- Good night.
<i>- Sayonara.</i>

564
00:33:33,509 --> 00:33:35,909
- Have fun.
<i>- Ciao.</i> Go back to the retirement village.

565
00:33:36,078 --> 00:33:37,340
Of course I do.

566
00:33:37,512 --> 00:33:39,241
Oh, my God. This is not happening.

567
00:33:41,317 --> 00:33:43,012
Come back here. Wait, wait, wait.

568
00:33:43,185 --> 00:33:44,846
- Just kiss me.
- What? Absolutely not.

569
00:33:45,019 --> 00:33:46,577
- I'm serious.
- Why would I? No.

570
00:33:46,756 --> 00:33:49,748
- Just kiss me right now.
- I'm not gonna kiss you. You're bipolar.

571
00:33:49,925 --> 00:33:52,393
- Stop.
- Oh.

572
00:33:55,297 --> 00:33:57,731
Lauren. Uh....

573
00:33:58,434 --> 00:33:59,458
Lauren, hey.

574
00:33:59,868 --> 00:34:02,336
- There you are.
- Oh. Oh, Steve.

575
00:34:02,772 --> 00:34:07,175
Oh, my God, that is so funny
running into you again. That's so funny.

576
00:34:07,342 --> 00:34:11,472
Um.... This is my boyfriend, FDR.

577
00:34:12,381 --> 00:34:13,405
Huh.

578
00:34:13,782 --> 00:34:16,512
He, uh... He's the surgeon
that we were talking about.

579
00:34:16,684 --> 00:34:18,345
- Huh.
- Yeah.

580
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:26,051
Neurosurgeon. I'm the department head
at the children's hospital.

581
00:34:26,228 --> 00:34:27,855
Wow, that's amazing.

582
00:34:28,029 --> 00:34:30,054
- He is. He's really amazing.
- Stop it.

583
00:34:30,231 --> 00:34:33,098
- Amazing?
- I don't know what makes me happier.

584
00:34:33,268 --> 00:34:36,203
Smile on a child's face
or waking up next to you every morning.

585
00:34:36,371 --> 00:34:39,397
- I love you.
- I love you. I love you too. That's so funny.

586
00:34:39,574 --> 00:34:41,405
Jinx. Ha-ha-ha.

587
00:34:41,576 --> 00:34:43,203
- We're really happy.
- Yeah, we are.

588
00:34:43,378 --> 00:34:44,970
- Yeah.
- Who wouldn't be happy...

589
00:34:45,146 --> 00:34:47,273
...with a girl like this?
She's got everything.

590
00:34:47,448 --> 00:34:50,008
- She got the beauty, style, grace.
- He's so sweet to me.

591
00:34:50,185 --> 00:34:52,676
- Did you know she was a gymnast?
- No, I didn't know.

592
00:34:52,854 --> 00:34:54,515
- Didn't think so.
- Yeah.

593
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:57,019
He likes it.

594
00:34:58,426 --> 00:35:01,054
- Frisky, I love it.
- Yeah.

595
00:35:03,932 --> 00:35:08,995
- Can you do that thing on the high bar?
- Yeah. I think we should get going.

596
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:13,334
- Stan, it was such a pleasure. We gotta go.
- I mean, it's Steve, but that's cool.

597
00:35:13,507 --> 00:35:15,202
- Great meeting you.
- Steve, yeah.

598
00:35:15,376 --> 00:35:16,536
Really nice meeting you.

599
00:35:16,711 --> 00:35:18,838
- Really nice meeting you.
- It was a pleasure.

600
00:35:19,012 --> 00:35:21,276
Oh, look at that.
A little kiss on the hand there.

601
00:35:21,448 --> 00:35:23,916
- That's sweet.
- You are so lucky.

602
00:35:24,285 --> 00:35:26,344
- I know.
- Yeah.

603
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,817
- Bye.
- Bye now, guys.

604
00:35:27,988 --> 00:35:29,785
Yeah.
- See you. Have fun, Simon.

605
00:35:29,957 --> 00:35:32,983
It's Steve.
- Okay. Thank you so much.

606
00:35:33,161 --> 00:35:35,129
What did you say?
This ear's a little deaf.

607
00:35:35,295 --> 00:35:39,095
I said, thank you. Thank you.
You don't have to be annoying about it.

608
00:35:39,267 --> 00:35:42,498
Do you wanna go grab a bite?
I know a pizza place around the corner.

609
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:46,864
You owe me an explanation
for whatever that was.

610
00:35:47,242 --> 00:35:49,574
- Okay. You're right, I do.
- Yeah?

611
00:35:49,743 --> 00:35:50,767
- Sure.
- Let's go.

612
00:35:50,944 --> 00:35:52,377
- Okay.
- Okay.

613
00:35:52,913 --> 00:35:56,679
So I packed up my entire life
and I followed him out here.

614
00:35:56,850 --> 00:36:00,809
And then six months later, I found him
in bed with a Pilates instructor.

615
00:36:01,021 --> 00:36:03,216
He's just not the guy I thought he was.

616
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:05,915
- I made a mistake.
- I don't believe in mistakes.

617
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:09,559
Well, that's a very convenient philosophy
for someone like yourself.

618
00:36:09,729 --> 00:36:12,061
It's the mistakes
that make us who we are.

619
00:36:12,232 --> 00:36:13,426
They led you here, right?

620
00:36:14,201 --> 00:36:16,328
Would you rather be back in Atlanta
right now?

621
00:36:16,503 --> 00:36:17,595
No, not really.

622
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:19,601
They led to your job,
you like your job.

623
00:36:19,773 --> 00:36:21,604
- I love my job.
- So there you go.

624
00:36:22,843 --> 00:36:24,401
Just saying.

625
00:36:26,313 --> 00:36:28,281
- You're very smart.
- Mm-hm.

626
00:36:28,448 --> 00:36:31,474
- Pretty smart for a club rat.
- Ha. Ouch.

627
00:36:37,357 --> 00:36:39,222
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

628
00:36:41,227 --> 00:36:43,695
Nice-looking woman from last night.

629
00:36:54,874 --> 00:36:58,002
- You reconned my date.
- What? No. No.

630
00:36:58,178 --> 00:36:59,543
Yeah, you did.

631
00:37:00,646 --> 00:37:02,773
Okay. I'm sorry, I did.
I reconned your date.

632
00:37:02,949 --> 00:37:04,348
- We had a deal.
- I know.

633
00:37:04,517 --> 00:37:06,985
- Sorry, I started thinking...
- You started thinking?

634
00:37:07,154 --> 00:37:08,712
I had to find out...
I didn't know.

635
00:37:08,888 --> 00:37:11,186
If there was some action,
what were you gonna do?

636
00:37:11,357 --> 00:37:12,517
- Call in Special Ops?
- No.

637
00:37:12,692 --> 00:37:15,126
- Sniper squad? Take me out?
- No, no. I mean...

638
00:37:15,294 --> 00:37:18,991
Our Munich office got a hit back on one
of Heinrich's men from Hong Kong.

639
00:37:19,165 --> 00:37:21,133
Name is Ivan Sokolov.

640
00:37:21,434 --> 00:37:23,732
Here's a surveillance file
from the DFS in Mexico.

641
00:37:23,903 --> 00:37:27,361
We expect he's trying to get Heinrich
into the country through L.A. Harbor.

642
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:30,532
Chatter suggests Ivan lives here in L.A.

643
00:37:31,277 --> 00:37:33,108
Now, flush him out.

644
00:37:33,279 --> 00:37:36,112
She's definitely lost her sparkle.

645
00:37:36,716 --> 00:37:40,652
All right, look, you flag Interpol,
I'll call some of our contacts.

646
00:37:46,659 --> 00:37:47,921
I really like this girl.

647
00:37:48,461 --> 00:37:49,553
I really like her too.

648
00:37:49,729 --> 00:37:52,254
No, I really, really like her.

649
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:54,091
- So do l.
- You do?

650
00:37:55,301 --> 00:37:56,495
Yeah, I do.

651
00:37:56,669 --> 00:37:59,103
- So you're not backing off?
- Nope.

652
00:38:00,138 --> 00:38:01,264
Okay.

653
00:38:03,642 --> 00:38:07,544
Then you ought to know that when
we went out on our date, Lauren and l...

654
00:38:09,581 --> 00:38:10,878
...we, um....

655
00:38:11,617 --> 00:38:13,107
What?

656
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:16,510
What? What did you do?

657
00:38:17,322 --> 00:38:18,914
We shared a kiss.

658
00:38:19,258 --> 00:38:21,522
- Wow.
- Mm-hm.

659
00:38:21,693 --> 00:38:24,184
Incredibly magical kiss with tongue.

660
00:38:24,362 --> 00:38:27,297
Oh, dear. Wonderful.

661
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,058
You are an animal.

662
00:38:30,235 --> 00:38:31,793
Look, pal, we kissed too.

663
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:34,905
It was pretty special.
I don't think it will be the last.

664
00:38:35,273 --> 00:38:38,208
- Well, we'll see about that, won't we?
- We shall see about that.

665
00:38:38,376 --> 00:38:40,367
Yes, we will. We will see about that.

666
00:38:42,414 --> 00:38:44,382
Don't do that. Don't say what I just said.

667
00:38:44,549 --> 00:38:46,483
We will see about that.

668
00:38:47,152 --> 00:38:48,449
About that, we will see.

669
00:38:49,354 --> 00:38:51,322
We will see about that.

670
00:38:51,489 --> 00:38:53,548
About that, we will see.

671
00:38:53,725 --> 00:38:56,660
Right. This is a live operation,
it's a full wrap and tap, boys.

672
00:38:56,828 --> 00:39:00,059
I want parabolics, infrareds, sat cams,
everything we got on the job.

673
00:39:00,231 --> 00:39:03,689
I want you to acquire intel
on one Lauren Scott.

674
00:39:03,868 --> 00:39:06,268
- What are her secret likes....
- Dislikes.

675
00:39:06,438 --> 00:39:08,633
I want to
know what makes her laugh, cry.

676
00:39:08,807 --> 00:39:10,240
Best friends, family members.

677
00:39:10,408 --> 00:39:11,670
Everything is important.

678
00:39:11,842 --> 00:39:13,469
The last three guys she slept with.

679
00:39:13,644 --> 00:39:15,407
Who she was sleeping with last week.

680
00:39:15,847 --> 00:39:17,178
You want us to take them out?

681
00:39:17,348 --> 00:39:19,111
You want us to take them out?

682
00:39:19,583 --> 00:39:20,811
Yea...

683
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:22,008
No.

684
00:39:22,287 --> 00:39:23,982
- No.
- I'm sorry, but...

685
00:39:24,155 --> 00:39:27,283
- Does this have to do with Heinrich?
- That's level 5 classified.

686
00:39:27,458 --> 00:39:29,323
For my eyes only.

687
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,421
This operation is top secret.

688
00:39:31,596 --> 00:39:34,030
- Don't let your country down, boys.
- Roger that.

689
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:41,268
<i>This is how we do it.</i>

690
00:39:43,073 --> 00:39:45,166
<i>This is how we do it.</i>

691
00:39:45,342 --> 00:39:47,276
<i>This is how we do it.</i>

692
00:39:47,445 --> 00:39:50,175
<i>It's Friday night.</i>

693
00:39:50,347 --> 00:39:51,780
<i>And I feel all right.</i>

694
00:39:51,949 --> 00:39:54,679
<i>And the party's here on the west side.</i>

695
00:39:54,853 --> 00:39:57,014
<i>So I reach for my 40
And I turn it up.</i>

696
00:39:57,187 --> 00:39:59,621
<i>Designated driver
Take the keys to my truck.</i>

697
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:02,623
<i>Hit the shore 'cause I'm faded
Honeys in the street say.</i>

698
00:40:02,826 --> 00:40:04,191
<i>Monty, yo, we made it.</i>

699
00:40:04,361 --> 00:40:05,385
<i>It feels so good.</i>

700
00:40:05,596 --> 00:40:08,565
<i>In my 'hood tonight.</i>

701
00:40:08,732 --> 00:40:10,723
<i>The summertime skirts
And the guys in Kani.</i>

702
00:40:10,901 --> 00:40:13,734
<i>All the gangbangers forgot
About the drive-by.</i>

703
00:40:13,904 --> 00:40:15,303
<i>You gotta get your groove on.</i>

704
00:40:15,472 --> 00:40:17,463
<i>Before you go get paid.</i>

705
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,835
<i>So tip up your cup
And throw your hands up.</i>

706
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:22,501
<i>And let me hear the party say.</i>

707
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:24,840
<i>I'm kind of buzzed and it's all because.</i>

708
00:40:25,014 --> 00:40:26,811
<i>This is how we do it.</i>

709
00:40:29,486 --> 00:40:31,681
<i>This is how we do it.</i>

710
00:40:31,854 --> 00:40:34,254
<i>To all my neighbors
You got much flavor.</i>

711
00:40:34,424 --> 00:40:37,154
<i>- This is how we do it.
- Let's flip the track.</i>

712
00:40:37,361 --> 00:40:38,988
<i>Bring the old school...</i>

713
00:40:39,162 --> 00:40:40,823
Aww.

714
00:40:40,997 --> 00:40:43,056
<i>This is how we do it.</i>

715
00:40:43,233 --> 00:40:45,497
<i>All hands are in the air.</i>

716
00:40:45,669 --> 00:40:47,534
<i>Wave them from here to there.</i>

717
00:40:47,703 --> 00:40:48,897
<i>If you're an O.G. mack.</i>

718
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:50,698
<i>Or a wanna-be player.</i>

719
00:40:50,874 --> 00:40:52,432
<i>You see, the hood's been good to me.</i>

720
00:40:52,643 --> 00:40:55,043
<i>Ever since I was a lower-case G.</i>

721
00:40:55,211 --> 00:40:57,111
<i>But now I'm a big G.</i>

722
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,441
<i>Let me hear the party say.</i>

723
00:40:59,616 --> 00:41:00,878
<i>If you were from.</i>

724
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:04,508
<i>Where I'm from then you would know.</i>

725
00:41:04,687 --> 00:41:06,587
<i>This is how we do it.</i>

726
00:41:28,411 --> 00:41:31,539
- What the hell is going on in here?
- Nothing.

727
00:41:31,714 --> 00:41:34,979
Sorry to interrupt playtime,
but we have an address on Ivan Sokolov.

728
00:41:35,151 --> 00:41:37,312
You boys
might wanna get out of the office.

729
00:41:37,485 --> 00:41:39,316
Absolutely.

730
00:41:42,858 --> 00:41:44,325
I'll take lead, you run backup.

731
00:41:44,492 --> 00:41:46,926
I was thinking of taking lead on this one,
thank you.

732
00:41:47,096 --> 00:41:50,532
- I'm always the first in the door.
- You're not always first at everything.

733
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:55,228
Hello. We're, um, friends of Ivan.

734
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,403
Oh, no, take lead, please.

735
00:41:59,574 --> 00:42:01,667
No, no. Honestly, after you.

736
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:04,669
- Brut?
- Patchouli.

737
00:42:04,847 --> 00:42:07,111
I love patchouli. Lovely.

738
00:42:08,116 --> 00:42:10,914
Oh, no, I'm like...
- Yeah. What are you betting down there?

739
00:42:11,087 --> 00:42:12,987
Hello! Cards!

740
00:42:13,154 --> 00:42:16,590
Mate, I am such a huge fan of poker.

741
00:42:16,758 --> 00:42:19,454
He actually won
the Go Fish Masters tournament in Reno.

742
00:42:19,629 --> 00:42:20,687
This is private game.

743
00:42:20,862 --> 00:42:24,821
Don't wave your hands at me, chief.
Don't you know who I am?

744
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,491
He got into the rosé at brunch,
he's gonzo.

745
00:42:27,669 --> 00:42:29,637
I said this is private game.

746
00:42:29,971 --> 00:42:31,131
I know who you are, mate.

747
00:42:32,974 --> 00:42:35,169
- Ivan.
- The terrible.

748
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:39,279
We're friends with Karl Heinrich.

749
00:42:39,447 --> 00:42:40,812
There's one little problem.

750
00:42:44,185 --> 00:42:45,982
Heinrich doesn't have any friends.

751
00:42:46,621 --> 00:42:48,282
Oh, dear.

752
00:42:54,663 --> 00:42:56,130
Mag! Give me a mag!

753
00:42:56,730 --> 00:42:58,527
Do you ever come prepared?

754
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,160
Bollocks, mate. Bollocks!

755
00:43:04,571 --> 00:43:05,799
Get out your gun.

756
00:43:10,178 --> 00:43:12,009
Tuck, get down!

757
00:43:23,525 --> 00:43:24,549
Get down!

758
00:43:51,251 --> 00:43:54,049
- There you are. I got you, eh, mate?
- No, I got him.

759
00:43:54,221 --> 00:43:56,746
Yeah, of course you did, mate.
I love your work.

760
00:43:58,992 --> 00:44:03,053
Tell us where Heinrich is
and we'll be able to cut you a deal, Ivan.

761
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:05,596
I'm not saying anything.

762
00:44:06,133 --> 00:44:10,035
Okay, you get three square meals a day
and we'll get you a nice pair of trousers.

763
00:44:10,203 --> 00:44:14,833
Let's go. Give deodorant
a chance, Ivan. You stink.

764
00:44:21,548 --> 00:44:23,072
- What's happening?
- Hm?

765
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:26,014
- What's going on?
- Uh, Collins. I'm gonna go see the medic.

766
00:44:26,185 --> 00:44:27,516
- Yeah.
- You?

767
00:44:27,688 --> 00:44:29,451
No. Just the intel flash coming over.

768
00:44:29,623 --> 00:44:31,420
- Roger that.
- Right. Right.

769
00:44:31,891 --> 00:44:33,358
She texted her friend Trish.

770
00:44:33,526 --> 00:44:36,120
Said she needed to talk
because she was F-T-F-O.

771
00:44:36,296 --> 00:44:40,027
Which Cryptography Department believes
means she was freaking the fuck out, sir.

772
00:44:40,199 --> 00:44:43,293
I S-H-l-T you not.
I was L-M-F-A-O when I read that.

773
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:46,906
- It was crazy, ridiculou...
- Bothwick! S-H-H-H-H-H.

774
00:44:47,073 --> 00:44:50,406
Trish then called the babysitter
and told her it was an emergency.

775
00:44:50,576 --> 00:44:52,745
This is serious. This is really serious.

776
00:44:53,646 --> 00:44:56,706
Can't believe this is my problem.
Last month, I was dating Boggle.

777
00:44:56,883 --> 00:44:58,612
This month, two gorgeous guys.

778
00:44:58,786 --> 00:45:02,119
I need you to stop making references
to Boggle like a man. It's a game.

779
00:45:02,288 --> 00:45:05,655
And you sound like a woman
who has nine cats and knits her ass off.

780
00:45:05,825 --> 00:45:09,090
You never said gorgeous. You said
good-looking. There's a difference...

781
00:45:09,262 --> 00:45:10,854
- Wanna see a picture of them?
- Yes.

782
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:13,464
- Okay.
- I didn't know you had pictures. Give it.

783
00:45:13,633 --> 00:45:15,692
Oh. Wow.

784
00:45:15,868 --> 00:45:17,028
- Right?
- That's dirty sex.

785
00:45:17,203 --> 00:45:20,297
You know you're gonna have dirty sex
and it's gonna stink.

786
00:45:20,473 --> 00:45:23,874
Not like sex.
I mean, like, man stink, the good stuff.

787
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:28,806
<i>That's pretty impressive. For you, yeah.
What does the other one look like?</i>

788
00:45:28,981 --> 00:45:31,108
<i>You just scroll over,
you do the finger thing.</i>

789
00:45:31,284 --> 00:45:33,718
<i>Oh, my God. He is hot too.</i>

790
00:45:33,886 --> 00:45:35,114
<i>I am impressed with you.</i>

791
00:45:35,288 --> 00:45:38,223
<i>- This is hotness. That man is...</i>
- You scared the shit out of me.

792
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:39,414
- You all right?
- Yup.

793
00:45:39,592 --> 00:45:41,651
- Medically speaking?
- Fine.

794
00:45:41,828 --> 00:45:45,195
They're people, not products.
- You're not a very good liar, know that?

795
00:45:45,363 --> 00:45:48,423
- Oh, yes, and you are.
<i>- They never play this game with me.</i>

796
00:45:48,601 --> 00:45:51,365
Seeing as we're both here,
we might as well share resources.

797
00:45:51,536 --> 00:45:53,697
<i>Incredible guys.</i>
- I don't have a choice.

798
00:45:53,872 --> 00:45:55,863
- Please, sit down.
- Oh, I'm staying.

799
00:45:56,042 --> 00:45:58,840
<i>Okay, good, good.</i>
<i>Well, I'm available as a friend.</i>

800
00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:01,444
If you want me to have sex
with both of those guys...

801
00:46:01,613 --> 00:46:05,481
...just to test out stuff and see
who comes back a winner and who doesn't.

802
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:09,142
They wouldn't know. I'd pretend I was you.
I'd put my hair up in a pony.

803
00:46:09,321 --> 00:46:13,189
Obviously I'm busy, because I'm a mother,
but I would carve out time in my schedule.

804
00:46:13,358 --> 00:46:14,985
That's the kind of friend I am.

805
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:18,357
- Why is she listening to that old man?
- I have no idea.

806
00:46:18,530 --> 00:46:21,727
- Okay. You know what? That's not helpful.
- Okay, fine.

807
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:23,959
Do one of your "focus groups"
you do at work.

808
00:46:24,135 --> 00:46:26,763
You can be the focus group,
I can be in charge, like you.

809
00:46:26,939 --> 00:46:28,804
<i>- Oh, that's actually a good idea.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

810
00:46:28,974 --> 00:46:30,202
<i>This is good, I like this.</i>

811
00:46:30,375 --> 00:46:32,969
Okay, so I will ask you questions
about the products.

812
00:46:33,144 --> 00:46:34,168
- Okay.
- The people.

813
00:46:34,346 --> 00:46:36,940
And you tell me who you like and why.

814
00:46:37,115 --> 00:46:38,878
<i>I don't know. They're both incredible.</i>

815
00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:40,915
What a struggle. I have to go home...

816
00:46:41,086 --> 00:46:43,611
...and clean tartar sauce
out of Bob's beard right now.

817
00:46:43,788 --> 00:46:45,483
Probably one of his testicles.

818
00:46:45,657 --> 00:46:48,285
You're gonna talk to me
about how amazing these guys are.

819
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:51,918
- Is there anything bad about them?
- Okay, let me think. Flaws.

820
00:46:53,064 --> 00:46:54,088
<i>I think there...</i>

821
00:46:54,366 --> 00:46:55,390
There is one thing.

822
00:46:57,401 --> 00:47:03,067
FDR has these tiny, like, girl hands.
Like little <i>T. rex</i> hands.

823
00:47:03,241 --> 00:47:04,765
- Ha!
<i>- Oh, grosss.</i>

824
00:47:04,942 --> 00:47:06,910
Means he's got a Mike and lke
for a penis.

825
00:47:09,447 --> 00:47:12,075
You know that's not true. You've seen it.

826
00:47:12,683 --> 00:47:15,413
You've seen it in Bangladesh,
you know that's not true.

827
00:47:16,121 --> 00:47:19,284
And Tuck is British.

828
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:20,814
Mm.

829
00:47:20,991 --> 00:47:23,619
- What is that supposed to mean?
<i>- Doesn't mean anything.</i>

830
00:47:23,795 --> 00:47:27,595
That's the same, they're kind of even.
So get into decision-making mode.

831
00:47:27,765 --> 00:47:31,701
And I need you to do it kind of quickly.
It's fun, but I'm not the one having sex.

832
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:34,634
- So I can't be that invested.
- Okay. You know what I need?

833
00:47:34,805 --> 00:47:35,931
Mm.

834
00:47:36,206 --> 00:47:38,265
- A joint. Okay.
- No, I need a deadline.

835
00:47:38,442 --> 00:47:41,434
Gonna give myself a finite
amount of time to make this decision.

836
00:47:41,612 --> 00:47:43,773
- That's good.
- One week I have to make a decision.

837
00:47:43,948 --> 00:47:44,937
<i>One week?</i>

838
00:47:46,985 --> 00:47:49,078
Okay, so she grew up in Georgia.

839
00:47:49,253 --> 00:47:51,346
She likes to volunteer at dog shelters.

840
00:47:51,522 --> 00:47:55,481
She's a fan of classic rock
and collecting mini Camaros.

841
00:47:55,659 --> 00:47:56,785
What, as in the cars?

842
00:47:58,162 --> 00:47:59,424
This is so fun!

843
00:47:59,597 --> 00:48:01,622
You're a natural in this.

844
00:48:02,498 --> 00:48:04,762
It's just so weird.
My dad used to collect these.

845
00:48:04,935 --> 00:48:08,063
They were never as nice as this one.
But he never let me drive them.

846
00:48:08,238 --> 00:48:10,763
I can't possibly imagine
why he wouldn't do that.

847
00:48:14,478 --> 00:48:17,470
<i>She's got a magic spell on me.</i>

848
00:48:22,519 --> 00:48:24,783
Did he just give our bird the bird?

849
00:48:30,995 --> 00:48:32,758
<i>Now I've got a woman.</i>

850
00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:37,126
- What was that?
- What? Well, that was the exhaust.

851
00:48:37,301 --> 00:48:38,632
- Oh.
- Give it some throttle. Go on.

852
00:48:43,507 --> 00:48:45,737
She likes red wine, lavender bath salts.

853
00:48:45,908 --> 00:48:49,036
And she collects posters
by Gustav Klimt.

854
00:48:49,212 --> 00:48:52,739
- Huh?
- Yeah. Austrian cat. Boy can paint.

855
00:48:52,915 --> 00:48:55,543
Ain't you never seen <i>The Kiss?</i>
You know, like that:

856
00:48:55,718 --> 00:48:57,083
Yeah, no, of course I have.

857
00:49:04,927 --> 00:49:06,189
Is this what I think it is?

858
00:49:06,629 --> 00:49:07,960
You're a fan?

859
00:49:08,131 --> 00:49:09,758
- Of Gustav Klimt?
- Of Gustav Klimt.

860
00:49:09,932 --> 00:49:12,594
- He's my favorite artist.
- He's my favorite artist.

861
00:49:12,769 --> 00:49:14,600
This is incredible.

862
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:16,829
- Are these real?
- Yeah.

863
00:49:17,373 --> 00:49:18,670
Okay, stop.

864
00:49:18,841 --> 00:49:20,308
- You recognize this?
- Yes.

865
00:49:20,476 --> 00:49:22,068
<i>- The Harpist</i>, 1895?
- I have this...

866
00:49:22,244 --> 00:49:24,371
- Seen it in a book.
- Pre-secession movement.

867
00:49:24,547 --> 00:49:27,175
Look at the tension between
two-and three-dimensionality.

868
00:49:27,350 --> 00:49:29,614
The tension between
two-and three-dimensionality.

869
00:49:29,785 --> 00:49:32,083
- Incredible. This is my favorite.
- How do you know?

870
00:49:32,255 --> 00:49:33,779
<i>Undine</i>, 1902.

871
00:49:34,057 --> 00:49:35,684
<i>Undine</i>, 1902.

872
00:49:35,858 --> 00:49:38,418
Oh, my goodness, this is amazing.

873
00:49:38,593 --> 00:49:40,618
Innovation became intrinsic....

874
00:49:40,797 --> 00:49:44,096
To Degas and other modernists.
You can see influence of art nouveau.

875
00:49:44,266 --> 00:49:46,393
Strong advocate
of finger-painting movement.

876
00:49:46,702 --> 00:49:48,033
What?

877
00:49:48,371 --> 00:49:49,804
Hey. We lost contact.

878
00:49:49,972 --> 00:49:54,170
Sometimes he would
finger his paintings to get closer to them.

879
00:49:54,342 --> 00:49:57,072
He, uh, used his....

880
00:49:57,547 --> 00:49:59,071
He would...

881
00:49:59,247 --> 00:50:03,240
The intimacy with the canvas
to finger a painting...

882
00:50:03,419 --> 00:50:04,909
To...

883
00:50:06,621 --> 00:50:11,081
Rather to paint using hands.

884
00:50:12,028 --> 00:50:14,087
Sometimes,
he would use mud and sticks.

885
00:50:14,262 --> 00:50:16,753
You know, he used mud and sticks... Ahem.

886
00:50:16,932 --> 00:50:18,524
He did?

887
00:50:19,302 --> 00:50:22,169
- If he couldn't find a stick...
- If he couldn't find a stick...

888
00:50:22,337 --> 00:50:24,669
- ...he would use his dick.
- ... he'd just use his...

889
00:50:24,973 --> 00:50:26,440
What?

890
00:50:26,608 --> 00:50:27,973
Oh, son of a bitch. Who is...?

891
00:50:28,143 --> 00:50:30,668
- Ha, ha.
- Ugh!

892
00:50:31,379 --> 00:50:37,249
You know, I think enough talking.

893
00:50:38,253 --> 00:50:40,915
Let's let the paintings speak
for themselves.

894
00:50:44,526 --> 00:50:46,517
Oh, my God.

895
00:50:47,062 --> 00:50:48,893
Wow.

896
00:50:50,231 --> 00:50:52,825
That is so beautiful.

897
00:50:53,602 --> 00:50:55,570
It's amazing.

898
00:51:03,944 --> 00:51:05,775
Just incredible.

899
00:51:05,946 --> 00:51:08,574
Yeah. It is.

900
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:10,581
Thank you.

901
00:51:12,686 --> 00:51:14,017
<i>- Hello?</i>
<i>- Hey, it's me.</i>

902
00:51:14,188 --> 00:51:16,622
<i>- How did it go?</i>
<i>- They both went well. Too well.</i>

903
00:51:16,792 --> 00:51:19,590

<i>- That's awesome. I'm coming over.</i>

904
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,194
Go up on 5.
Let's just pump the audio a little bit.

905
00:51:22,363 --> 00:51:26,629
Are you sure about this, sir? We might
have some constitutional issues here.

906
00:51:27,401 --> 00:51:28,834
Patriot Act.

907
00:51:31,773 --> 00:51:35,072
<i>- So how was it?</i>
<i>- They're both incredible.</i>

908
00:51:35,276 --> 00:51:38,973
Uh, FDR has these amazing eyes
that you just wanna melt into.

909
00:51:39,147 --> 00:51:41,342
So beautiful.
He brings out the best in me.

910
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:42,880
He really challenges me.

911
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:46,850
But he's that guy who's always on,
he's superslick.

912
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:50,388
Sometimes, I think he doesn't care
about anything more than himself.

913
00:51:53,761 --> 00:51:57,197
Well, they say it's a sanctuary for them,
but it's... Here it is.

914
00:51:57,364 --> 00:52:00,026
- This is amazing.
- It's really more of a sanctuary for me.

915
00:52:00,201 --> 00:52:01,600
- Hey, Rebecca.
- Who's that man?

916
00:52:01,768 --> 00:52:03,497
- Hey, Betty.
- Excuse me?

917
00:52:03,671 --> 00:52:06,299
I just had no idea
you were so passionate about animals.

918
00:52:06,473 --> 00:52:08,941
Yeah. Animals and kids.

919
00:52:09,108 --> 00:52:10,473
What's up?

920
00:52:10,643 --> 00:52:12,804
- How you doing, Nick?
- What?

921
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:16,008
There are a lot of things
you don't know about me...

922
00:52:16,616 --> 00:52:19,949
- ...and it takes a while for me to open up.
- I can see that.

923
00:52:22,056 --> 00:52:24,388
Oh, what's the matter?

924
00:52:24,624 --> 00:52:26,683
- What's the matter, you?
- Hey, little guy.

925
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:28,418
- What's going on?
- You okay?

926
00:52:28,696 --> 00:52:31,096
- Are you allowed to open the cages?
- All the time.

927
00:52:31,264 --> 00:52:33,198
- Okay.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

928
00:52:33,366 --> 00:52:35,994
- Hey, Snuggles, how are you, bud?
- It's a Boston terrier.

929
00:52:36,170 --> 00:52:37,637
I love these dogs. Hi.

930
00:52:39,038 --> 00:52:40,300
Hi.

931
00:52:42,976 --> 00:52:44,967
Yeah. That's a lot of energy.

932
00:52:45,879 --> 00:52:46,937
I love this place.

933
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:50,606
Mm.

934
00:52:58,224 --> 00:53:00,124
- What's in your mouth?
- A lot of dog hair.

935
00:53:00,293 --> 00:53:02,352
- Yeah.
- So....

936
00:53:02,528 --> 00:53:04,120
I know.

937
00:53:04,364 --> 00:53:06,025
Big mess.

938
00:53:06,199 --> 00:53:09,293
- Do you wanna help me pick one out?
- You're gonna adopt a dog?

939
00:53:10,136 --> 00:53:14,596
I think it's time for me to be responsible
for something other than myself, you know?

940
00:53:15,174 --> 00:53:17,574
Wow, I think that's so great.

941
00:53:21,914 --> 00:53:23,404
Okay.

942
00:53:24,050 --> 00:53:27,542
Let's pick the saddest,
oldest bastard here.

943
00:53:29,454 --> 00:53:30,785
<i>Okay, what about Tuck?</i>

944
00:53:31,824 --> 00:53:32,848
<i>Uh, Tuck is great.</i>

945
00:53:33,026 --> 00:53:34,960
He's sweet, he's ki...
We have so much fun.

946
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:37,426
<i>More fun that I've ever had
in my entire life.</i>

947
00:53:37,596 --> 00:53:41,726
But he's maybe too sweet?
A little earnest?

948
00:53:42,168 --> 00:53:44,102
Uh, sort of safe.

949
00:53:44,269 --> 00:53:47,864
Yeah. That's boring. I almost fell
asleep just listening to that.

950
00:53:49,909 --> 00:53:51,001
Safe.

951
00:53:51,176 --> 00:53:52,438
Okay, I think I'm ready.

952
00:53:52,611 --> 00:53:54,875
- You ever carried a weapon before?
- You know...

953
00:53:55,214 --> 00:53:56,476
Not really, no.

954
00:53:56,649 --> 00:54:00,346
Okay. Okay. I need you to keep that end
of the weapon well away from me, clear?

955
00:54:00,519 --> 00:54:02,111
- Okay.
- Thumbs up.

956
00:54:02,287 --> 00:54:04,221
- This will be fun.
- No.

957
00:54:04,390 --> 00:54:05,914
It's not fun.

958
00:54:06,892 --> 00:54:08,519
It's dangerous.

959
00:54:12,965 --> 00:54:14,432
Hey, watch there.

960
00:54:14,599 --> 00:54:18,558
- Men! Move.
- My face!

961
00:54:18,737 --> 00:54:20,364
Oh, my God.

962
00:54:21,506 --> 00:54:23,667
Man, come on.

963
00:54:25,077 --> 00:54:26,408
- Come on.
- Oh!

964
00:54:26,578 --> 00:54:28,045
Okay.

965
00:54:28,981 --> 00:54:32,212
Oh, God, I gotta get the goggles on.
This is very stressful!

966
00:54:33,986 --> 00:54:37,012
- Clear. We're coming out. Okay, come on.
- Okay.

967
00:54:37,456 --> 00:54:38,480
Get him!

968
00:54:43,328 --> 00:54:44,852
- No head shots!
- That's illegal.

969
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:46,088
Oh, my God.

970
00:54:46,832 --> 00:54:48,527
I'm scared.

971
00:54:51,770 --> 00:54:53,499
It's a grenade!

972
00:54:54,339 --> 00:54:55,897
<i>How you like me now.</i>

973
00:54:57,842 --> 00:54:58,866
How you like me now.

974
00:54:59,411 --> 00:55:00,776
Who is that guy?

975
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:04,346
It's just a game. Ah!

976
00:55:04,548 --> 00:55:06,539
Let's get out of here.

977
00:55:07,886 --> 00:55:10,912
Huh? Oh, yes.

978
00:55:12,556 --> 00:55:13,955
Oh, my God.

979
00:55:14,125 --> 00:55:15,786
- Did you see me light that up?
- Okay.

980
00:55:15,961 --> 00:55:17,929
That boy come right out of nowhere.

981
00:55:18,095 --> 00:55:20,290
Okay, you are disturbingly good at this.

982
00:55:20,464 --> 00:55:22,694
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, how does that make you feel?

983
00:55:22,867 --> 00:55:25,768
Like if our nation gets attacked
by random paintball people...

984
00:55:25,936 --> 00:55:28,200
- ...I'll be safe.
- Safe.

985
00:55:28,372 --> 00:55:31,170
I tried to get your back there.
I got off a few shots...

986
00:55:31,343 --> 00:55:33,675
...but I think my triggering mechanism
was stuck.

987
00:55:33,844 --> 00:55:35,744
- You got the safety on.
- I was trying to...

988
00:55:35,913 --> 00:55:37,972
- Oh, you mean this thing here?
- Yeah. Ugh!

989
00:55:38,149 --> 00:55:39,741
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

990
00:55:40,051 --> 00:55:41,882
Ha, ha. Oh, I'm sorry I'm laugh...

991
00:55:42,053 --> 00:55:44,317
I have this laughter thing
when bad things happen.

992
00:55:44,488 --> 00:55:46,615
It's not funny. I shouldn't do that.

993
00:55:46,791 --> 00:55:48,656
Are you okay? Can you walk?

994
00:55:48,826 --> 00:55:51,021
Yeah, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.

995
00:55:51,195 --> 00:55:53,356
Oh, my God, I feel so bad.

996
00:55:54,531 --> 00:55:55,793
Yeah, it's good.

997
00:55:55,966 --> 00:55:58,867
- Come on, let's go get something to eat.
- Okay.

998
00:55:59,870 --> 00:56:03,135
So you know how I was telling you
that Tuck has been really earnest?

999
00:56:03,307 --> 00:56:05,172
The other day, we went paintballing...

1000
00:56:05,342 --> 00:56:08,140
...and he nearly put this kid's eye out
with a paintball gun.

1001
00:56:08,312 --> 00:56:10,280
Then FDR,
we went to this animal shelter...

1002
00:56:10,447 --> 00:56:12,881
...and he adopted a 12-year-old dog
with a milky eye.

1003
00:56:13,050 --> 00:56:14,711
I'm telling you, it's getting weird.

1004
00:56:14,885 --> 00:56:17,752
I can't help but thinking
I'm putting them in this position.

1005
00:56:17,921 --> 00:56:19,980
It's making them crazy.
It's making me crazy.

1006
00:56:20,157 --> 00:56:22,091
So, what are you gonna do about it?

1007
00:56:22,259 --> 00:56:25,251
I have to do what any rational woman
in my position would do.

1008
00:56:25,428 --> 00:56:27,362
- Break up with them?
- Sleep with them.

1009
00:56:29,266 --> 00:56:30,290
Sex tiebreaker.

1010
00:56:30,468 --> 00:56:32,493
Oh, thank you! Finally!

1011
00:56:32,669 --> 00:56:34,796
A sex tiebreaker!
That is what you need to do!

1012
00:56:34,971 --> 00:56:36,802
You have to have sex with both of them!

1013
00:56:36,974 --> 00:56:38,532
<i>Thank you.</i>

1014
00:56:38,708 --> 00:56:42,041
<i>What? It's called the birds and the bees,
bitch, okay? Google it.</i>

1015
00:56:42,212 --> 00:56:43,270
We had a deal.

1016
00:56:43,447 --> 00:56:45,005
Well, we have a deal.

1017
00:56:45,182 --> 00:56:47,446
- We have a deal.
- I'm not gonna have sex with her.

1018
00:56:47,617 --> 00:56:50,518
And I am not gonna have sex
with this woman either.

1019
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:52,120
No matter how hard she tries.

1020
00:56:52,289 --> 00:56:55,349
- We have a gentleman's agreement.
- We have a gentleman's agreement.

1021
00:56:55,525 --> 00:56:58,187
And we are gentlemen.

1022
00:56:58,728 --> 00:57:00,161
Okay?

1023
00:57:00,330 --> 00:57:02,195
Ha-ha-ha. Okay.

1024
00:57:02,899 --> 00:57:05,163
- Okay.
- Good.

1025
00:57:06,035 --> 00:57:07,229
Good Lord.

1026
00:57:07,403 --> 00:57:09,234
- That the time?
- Yeah, I got that thing.

1027
00:57:09,405 --> 00:57:11,236
I gotta be somewhere this time.

1028
00:57:12,475 --> 00:57:14,807
Full-scale tactical prevention mode.

1029
00:57:14,977 --> 00:57:16,604
What exactly do you have in mind?

1030
00:57:16,779 --> 00:57:17,871
Yeah.

1031
00:57:18,047 --> 00:57:20,982
Wow, this is amazing.

1032
00:57:21,284 --> 00:57:22,751
Indeed.
- How nice.

1033
00:57:22,918 --> 00:57:27,321
- Do you think the candles are a bit cheesy?
- No. I think they're wonderful.

1034
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:31,483
This has been the perfect night.

1035
00:57:37,166 --> 00:57:38,895
Dickerman...

1036
00:57:40,637 --> 00:57:42,571
...make it rain.

1037
00:57:47,644 --> 00:57:49,043
<i>Can't stand it</i>

1038
00:57:49,212 --> 00:57:51,077
<i>I know you planned it
I'm gonna set it straight.</i>

1039
00:57:51,246 --> 00:57:52,611
<i>Sabotage.</i>

1040
00:57:54,149 --> 00:57:56,413
You really think you can trust him?

1041
00:57:56,586 --> 00:57:58,383
Absolutely not.

1042
00:57:58,554 --> 00:58:01,284
- Okay, I believe you.
- Wow.

1043
00:58:01,890 --> 00:58:03,255
- This is great.
- Yeah?

1044
00:58:03,426 --> 00:58:04,450
Yeah.

1045
00:58:04,627 --> 00:58:06,219
- Pool on the roof.
- Oh, you know...

1046
00:58:06,395 --> 00:58:09,660
...it's hydrotherapy
for an old football injury.

1047
00:58:14,069 --> 00:58:15,263
I'll be right back.

1048
00:58:15,437 --> 00:58:17,166
- Okay?
- Okay.

1049
00:58:35,557 --> 00:58:36,956
Come on, scram. Let's go.

1050
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:40,326
<i>He moves in space</i>

1051
00:58:42,430 --> 00:58:43,863
God.

1052
00:58:49,537 --> 00:58:50,595
<i>It's a sabotage.</i>

1053
00:58:50,771 --> 00:58:52,864
<i>Can't stand it
I know you planned it.</i>

1054
00:58:53,041 --> 00:58:54,668
Son of a...

1055
00:58:56,177 --> 00:58:59,613
<i>I can't stand rocking
When I fly off the handle.</i>

1056
00:58:59,781 --> 00:59:02,477
<i>What could it be?
It's a mirage.</i>

1057
00:59:02,651 --> 00:59:05,950
<i>You're scheming on a thing
That's sabotage.</i>

1058
00:59:09,491 --> 00:59:11,925
<i>Smooth operator.</i>

1059
00:59:12,093 --> 00:59:13,117
FDR?

1060
00:59:13,294 --> 00:59:15,285
<i>Smooth operator.</i>

1061
00:59:15,463 --> 00:59:16,691
Really?

1062
00:59:17,032 --> 00:59:18,795
<i>Smooth operator.</i>

1063
00:59:18,966 --> 00:59:19,990
<i>A tranq dart.</i>

1064
00:59:20,167 --> 00:59:23,603
A tranq dart.
Three inches over, I would've been dead.

1065
00:59:23,772 --> 00:59:27,333
Four. Four inches, okay?

1066
00:59:28,976 --> 00:59:30,341
- Neanderthal.
- Morning, sirs.

1067
00:59:30,511 --> 00:59:31,535
Shut up.

1068
00:59:31,713 --> 00:59:33,840
Jesus.
I cannot believe you didn't trust me.

1069
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:36,609
We both know what happens
when you listen to Sade.

1070
00:59:36,784 --> 00:59:38,445
- She's an incredible singer.
- She is.

1071
00:59:38,619 --> 00:59:40,849
Your hormones start,
you turn into Horny Pants.

1072
00:59:41,022 --> 00:59:43,047
- Hor...
- And might I remind you...

1073
00:59:43,224 --> 00:59:46,159
...you were the one
who flooded my apartment first.

1074
00:59:46,327 --> 00:59:47,988
- The candles were a fire hazard.
- No.

1075
00:59:48,162 --> 00:59:52,531
The only thing you were worried about
getting fired up was Lauren, wasn't it?

1076
00:59:53,134 --> 00:59:54,863
Honesty, Franklin.

1077
00:59:55,035 --> 00:59:56,468
Try it.

1078
00:59:58,673 --> 01:00:00,402
Right!

1079
01:00:00,675 --> 01:00:05,408
Now, I have very serious
anger management issues today, Ivan...

1080
01:00:05,579 --> 01:00:09,743
...so I would appreciate it
if you'd do me the courtesy...

1081
01:00:10,550 --> 01:00:13,815
...of answering
all my terribly boring questions...

1082
01:00:14,388 --> 01:00:15,514
...sharpish.

1083
01:00:15,690 --> 01:00:18,523
- Heh, heh. The pliers, really?
- Yes, the pliers, really.

1084
01:00:18,692 --> 01:00:22,492
- Predictable, safe and boring yet again.
- Why don't you tickle Ivan's feet...

1085
01:00:22,663 --> 01:00:28,158
...till he talks with your teeny,
tiny, itty-bitty jazz hands?

1086
01:00:29,403 --> 01:00:30,427
Heh.

1087
01:00:35,008 --> 01:00:37,568
Where is Heinrich, brother?

1088
01:00:38,311 --> 01:00:42,042
Sooner or later he'll be coming for you.

1089
01:00:42,215 --> 01:00:43,273
Brother.

1090
01:00:44,585 --> 01:00:46,280
You are going to die.

1091
01:00:48,388 --> 01:00:49,719
Don't worry, you're next.

1092
01:01:07,473 --> 01:01:10,840
I'm sorry about Jonas.

1093
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:30,527
- Ooh! Oh, gosh.
- No, no, no. Just let him do his thing.

1094
01:01:33,166 --> 01:01:34,793
Oh, hello.

1095
01:01:35,168 --> 01:01:39,332
Uh, Nana, this is Lauren.
Lauren, this is my grandmother, Nana.

1096
01:01:39,505 --> 01:01:43,236
So you're the girl who's been putting up
with Franklin.

1097
01:01:43,409 --> 01:01:45,036
- Mm-hm.
- I brought pie.

1098
01:01:45,210 --> 01:01:49,510
Yeah, you know where the kitchen is.
Lauren and I have a lot to talk about.

1099
01:01:55,187 --> 01:01:57,655
Yes, this is pretty, isn't it?

1100
01:01:59,358 --> 01:02:01,349
Oh, this is beautiful.

1101
01:02:01,693 --> 01:02:03,820
- Oh, is this FDR?
- Oh, yes.

1102
01:02:03,997 --> 01:02:05,021
Look at that unibrow.

1103
01:02:05,531 --> 01:02:08,500
- It goes all the way around his head.
- I know, he was so cute.

1104
01:02:08,667 --> 01:02:11,295
- Hi, Dottie.
- And who are these people?

1105
01:02:12,005 --> 01:02:14,872
Oh, those are his parents.

1106
01:02:15,541 --> 01:02:18,374
They died when he was 9.

1107
01:02:18,811 --> 01:02:20,472
I'm so sorry.

1108
01:02:20,646 --> 01:02:22,841
- He never told me that.
- Yeah.

1109
01:02:23,015 --> 01:02:26,849
In a car crash. They were going out
to dinner one night and, um...

1110
01:02:27,018 --> 01:02:30,283
Well, he's never been
quite the same since.

1111
01:02:30,456 --> 01:02:33,152
He has a hard time trusting people.

1112
01:02:33,325 --> 01:02:36,658
But he must trust you.

1113
01:02:36,829 --> 01:02:41,926
Because you are the first girl
he's ever brought here.

1114
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:45,163
I have a hard time trusting people too.

1115
01:02:48,673 --> 01:02:51,574
He had the biggest blue eyes,
like marbles.

1116
01:02:51,743 --> 01:02:54,405
Which almost made up
for the bed-wetting.

1117
01:02:55,781 --> 01:02:58,409
Nana. We really don't have to talk
about that right now.

1118
01:02:58,583 --> 01:02:59,982
- Oh, we really do.
- No, no, no.

1119
01:03:00,152 --> 01:03:01,517
- No, we should.
- No, no, no.

1120
01:03:01,687 --> 01:03:02,847
- We ought to.
- I know...

1121
01:03:03,021 --> 01:03:05,615
He wore that Superman costume
everywhere.

1122
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:07,485
You wouldn't believe the smell.

1123
01:03:08,861 --> 01:03:11,921
But how were we to know
that he would take it so literally?

1124
01:03:12,096 --> 01:03:15,156
- The little fellow jumped off the roof.
- Oh!

1125
01:03:17,202 --> 01:03:18,999
I was given misinformation, okay?

1126
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:21,195
We all make mistakes.
That was one of mine.

1127
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:26,341
Yes, but remember, Franklin,
there are no mistakes.

1128
01:03:28,045 --> 01:03:29,205
To no mistakes.

1129
01:03:29,514 --> 01:03:31,379
- To no mistakes.
- To no mistakes.

1130
01:03:35,219 --> 01:03:38,154
- Okay, wearing dresses.
- I was only wearing them...

1131
01:03:38,322 --> 01:03:40,187
<i>...because I thought they were capes.</i>

1132
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:42,053
Are we recording this?

1133
01:03:43,094 --> 01:03:44,527
I had a nice time tonight.

1134
01:03:45,196 --> 01:03:46,390
Me too.

1135
01:03:46,564 --> 01:03:48,896
I like that guy with the unibrow
and the braces.

1136
01:03:49,066 --> 01:03:50,966
- Ha, ha.
- I actually...

1137
01:03:51,135 --> 01:03:52,898
I might like him more than I like you.

1138
01:03:54,237 --> 01:03:55,397
He likes you too.

1139
01:04:02,279 --> 01:04:04,110
Ha, ha. I should go.

1140
01:04:04,715 --> 01:04:06,148
Yeah.

1141
01:04:07,151 --> 01:04:08,550
I should be a gentleman.

1142
01:04:09,519 --> 01:04:12,977
Well, the good news is
I'm no gentleman.

1143
01:04:15,892 --> 01:04:16,984
This is not good.

1144
01:04:19,162 --> 01:04:20,322
<i>She blew my mind.</i>

1145
01:04:22,333 --> 01:04:24,164
<i>And we've been hangin' out.</i>

1146
01:04:25,302 --> 01:04:26,963
<i>Ever since that time.</i>

1147
01:04:28,673 --> 01:04:30,971
<i>We got good love.</i>

1148
01:04:31,975 --> 01:04:33,840
<i>Rock 'n' roll.</i>

1149
01:04:34,277 --> 01:04:35,676
Oh, no.

1150
01:04:35,846 --> 01:04:38,314
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

1151
01:04:38,481 --> 01:04:41,075
<i>Sweet, sweet love.</i>

1152
01:04:41,618 --> 01:04:44,485
<i>Sweet, sweet love.</i>

1153
01:04:44,722 --> 01:04:49,182
<i>Sweet, sweet love.</i>

1154
01:04:59,568 --> 01:05:00,933
Hey.
- Oh, God!

1155
01:05:02,238 --> 01:05:04,172
Oh, my God. Okay.

1156
01:05:04,574 --> 01:05:06,804
- Morning.
- Good morning.

1157
01:05:07,409 --> 01:05:10,606
- You're dressed. Where you going?
- I have to go to work.

1158
01:05:10,981 --> 01:05:13,973
I thought maybe we could make pancakes
or something.

1159
01:05:14,350 --> 01:05:15,442
Do you like pancakes?

1160
01:05:15,618 --> 01:05:18,052
I love pancakes.
Really, I'd love to have pancakes.

1161
01:05:18,221 --> 01:05:21,315
- Who doesn't like pancakes? Crazy people.
- Crazy people.

1162
01:05:21,690 --> 01:05:23,555
I have to go to work. I have a meeting.

1163
01:05:23,726 --> 01:05:26,695
Really super early.
So I gotta go.

1164
01:05:27,364 --> 01:05:29,389
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, no, that's cool.

1165
01:05:29,565 --> 01:05:31,624
I have... I've got a meeting too, so...

1166
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:32,994
- Okay.
- Last night was...

1167
01:05:35,605 --> 01:05:39,564
- Uh.... Was...
- Was incredible.

1168
01:05:39,742 --> 01:05:41,573
That was crazy.

1169
01:05:41,745 --> 01:05:42,803
Yeah.

1170
01:05:43,312 --> 01:05:46,406
Uh, thank you for the...

1171
01:05:46,582 --> 01:05:49,380
Thank you for that.

1172
01:05:49,953 --> 01:05:51,045
So I'm gonna go.

1173
01:05:51,220 --> 01:05:53,916
But lock up behind you... Or don't lo...
I don't know.

1174
01:05:54,089 --> 01:05:56,990
You're not gonna steal anything.
I don't know why I said that.

1175
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:58,650
Okay, bye.

1176
01:05:59,128 --> 01:06:00,652
Bye.

1177
01:06:02,464 --> 01:06:04,864
Trish, I slept with him.

1178
01:06:05,034 --> 01:06:06,865
<i>Which one?</i>
- FDR.

1179
01:06:07,036 --> 01:06:10,199
Oh, my God, that's awesome.
How do you feel? Can you walk?

1180
01:06:10,572 --> 01:06:12,233
Small hands, not an issue.

1181
01:06:12,408 --> 01:06:14,467
I told you it wasn't gonna be an issue.

1182
01:06:14,643 --> 01:06:15,905
<i>How was it?</i>

1183
01:06:16,078 --> 01:06:18,205
Amazing. Like five times amazing.

1184
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:20,746
But I'm supposed to go meet Tuck
this afternoon.

1185
01:06:20,916 --> 01:06:23,214
But after last night,
I can't see Tuck now.

1186
01:06:23,385 --> 01:06:25,615
<i>No, no, they do it to
us all the time, okay?</i>

1187
01:06:25,788 --> 01:06:28,416
You think Gloria Steinem got arrested
and sat in jail...

1188
01:06:28,590 --> 01:06:33,220
...so you could act like a little bitch? I don't think so.
Get out there, you get flexible.

1189
01:06:33,895 --> 01:06:36,420
- I'm going to hell.
- You're not. If you go there, I'm...

1190
01:06:36,598 --> 01:06:37,929
I'll be there to pick you up.

1191
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:40,035
Okay, save me a drink.

1192
01:06:40,402 --> 01:06:42,427
You got last night's surveillance tape?

1193
01:06:42,603 --> 01:06:44,537
Oh, hey, uh....

1194
01:06:45,374 --> 01:06:46,636
We didn't get anything.

1195
01:06:47,142 --> 01:06:48,632
We got nothing.

1196
01:06:48,810 --> 01:06:52,906
The tape jammed, so.... Ha, ha.

1197
01:06:53,248 --> 01:06:54,943
Boylee, it's digital, you plank.

1198
01:06:56,050 --> 01:06:58,416
- Right. So can I have the disk?
- Yup.

1199
01:07:02,291 --> 01:07:04,156
Seriously, you don't wanna see it.

1200
01:07:04,325 --> 01:07:07,123
I'll be the judge of that,
thank you very much.

1201
01:07:07,996 --> 01:07:09,122
Now, did you see this?

1202
01:07:10,498 --> 01:07:11,624
Only once.

1203
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:13,458
Right. What happened?

1204
01:07:14,435 --> 01:07:16,062
Agent Foster entered the premises.

1205
01:07:16,238 --> 01:07:18,069
- All right.
- Yep.

1206
01:07:20,074 --> 01:07:21,939
- And?
- Ha, ha.

1207
01:07:22,110 --> 01:07:23,441
- Boylee.
- Ahem.

1208
01:07:24,912 --> 01:07:26,937
- Then he...
- Boylee, what happened next?

1209
01:07:27,749 --> 01:07:29,148
Then he entered the premises.

1210
01:07:29,317 --> 01:07:33,583
I got it, mate. Yeah, I totally understand.
Thank you very much. Cheers, mate.

1211
01:07:36,257 --> 01:07:38,191
<i>Open your eyes.</i>

1212
01:07:44,465 --> 01:07:46,023
<i>I'm flying.</i>

1213
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:47,599
<i>Jack.</i>

1214
01:07:53,341 --> 01:07:55,036
Hey.

1215
01:07:55,308 --> 01:07:57,003
- Hi.
- Maya.

1216
01:07:57,178 --> 01:07:59,339
So it's Tuesday.

1217
01:07:59,514 --> 01:08:00,503
Mm-hm.

1218
01:08:00,681 --> 01:08:02,148
My layover day?

1219
01:08:03,450 --> 01:08:05,850
Yeah. Right. Um....

1220
01:08:07,021 --> 01:08:08,613
It's just...

1221
01:08:08,855 --> 01:08:09,879
Look, l...

1222
01:08:10,056 --> 01:08:13,423
I can't really do this, um....

1223
01:08:14,929 --> 01:08:16,658
I met somebody.

1224
01:08:16,830 --> 01:08:18,161
Sorry.

1225
01:08:21,602 --> 01:08:22,626
Okay.

1226
01:08:37,385 --> 01:08:39,512
What's happening to me?

1227
01:08:39,786 --> 01:08:41,515
You have absolutely no self-control.

1228
01:08:41,688 --> 01:08:44,816
Tuck, look,
I didn't plan on this happening, okay?

1229
01:08:44,991 --> 01:08:47,323
She's the one that initiated it
in the first place.

1230
01:08:47,494 --> 01:08:49,018
Well, of course she initiated.

1231
01:08:49,196 --> 01:08:52,256
You roll out the big, happy family,
it's like girl porn, isn't it?

1232
01:08:52,432 --> 01:08:55,492
- You broke the rules, man.
- Forget the rules. Not a game anymore.

1233
01:08:55,669 --> 01:08:57,933
- I care for Lauren.
- Great, you have affections.

1234
01:08:58,104 --> 01:08:59,628
- It only took you 30 years.
- Tuck.

1235
01:08:59,805 --> 01:09:01,773
- What?
- I slept with her.

1236
01:09:02,642 --> 01:09:06,169
- Yeah, well, I'm well aware of that, aren't l?
- No, slept. Fell asleep.

1237
01:09:06,446 --> 01:09:08,880
That's never happened to me before.

1238
01:09:15,054 --> 01:09:16,919
Hey, Mom, I'm coming!

1239
01:09:17,757 --> 01:09:20,282
Hey, spudley, how you doing?
Come on, give us a cuddle.

1240
01:09:20,660 --> 01:09:21,854
Hello.

1241
01:09:23,662 --> 01:09:25,095
This is my friend Lauren.

1242
01:09:26,666 --> 01:09:28,759
I thought Uncle Frank
was your only friend.

1243
01:09:28,934 --> 01:09:30,299
Who's Uncle Frank?

1244
01:09:30,469 --> 01:09:33,495
Yes. Ha, ha. Um.... Ahem.

1245
01:09:34,507 --> 01:09:36,702
He's right.
He is my only friend from work.

1246
01:09:37,176 --> 01:09:40,270
But this is my new friend. Lauren.

1247
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:42,648
- Hi.
- Hi.

1248
01:09:43,415 --> 01:09:45,576
Hey, what are you two doing
this afternoon?

1249
01:09:45,751 --> 01:09:47,048
I need some help with work.

1250
01:09:47,219 --> 01:09:49,050
<i>- You could be the men for the job.</i>
- No.

1251
01:09:49,222 --> 01:09:50,621
<i>- Yeah?</i>
<i>- That sounds great.</i>

1252
01:10:03,936 --> 01:10:05,301
Hands up.
- No.

1253
01:10:05,471 --> 01:10:07,598
<i>Now I've got a woman.</i>

1254
01:10:10,843 --> 01:10:12,902
<i>She's got a magic spell on me.</i>

1255
01:10:13,078 --> 01:10:14,943
Go to sat cam 6.

1256
01:10:16,749 --> 01:10:18,273
Bye, Lauren.

1257
01:10:23,088 --> 01:10:24,282
Hello.

1258
01:10:24,456 --> 01:10:25,821
Hello.

1259
01:10:27,425 --> 01:10:29,655
<i>Now I've got a woman.</i>

1260
01:10:30,062 --> 01:10:31,324
He just used the kid.

1261
01:10:31,497 --> 01:10:33,260
He used the kid.

1262
01:10:34,933 --> 01:10:37,299
Maybe we could get you a kid, sir.
For a day.

1263
01:10:37,770 --> 01:10:40,295
- You know a guy?
- I know a guy.

1264
01:10:40,706 --> 01:10:42,105
No.

1265
01:10:46,278 --> 01:10:49,805
<i>She's got a magic spell on me.</i>

1266
01:10:52,351 --> 01:10:55,115
<i>I had a really fantastic day today,
thank you very much.</i>

1267
01:10:55,287 --> 01:10:56,311
<i>So did I.</i>

1268
01:10:57,789 --> 01:10:59,256
Good night.

1269
01:11:16,241 --> 01:11:18,402
<i>I got no beef with repetition.</i>

1270
01:11:18,576 --> 01:11:20,043
Go inside. Go inside the house.

1271
01:11:20,211 --> 01:11:22,372
You don't wanna see the... Oh, my God.

1272
01:11:23,247 --> 01:11:26,045
<i>I got no beef with repetition.</i>

1273
01:11:28,419 --> 01:11:30,011
Bring up 5.

1274
01:11:32,757 --> 01:11:34,588
- Two...
- Where did they go? Bring up 3.

1275
01:11:38,429 --> 01:11:41,159
Tuck, we need to talk.

1276
01:11:41,499 --> 01:11:43,091
In a little bit.

1277
01:11:45,036 --> 01:11:47,163
- It's dead. He's killing our bugs.
- Bring up 4.

1278
01:11:47,337 --> 01:11:48,395
There goes 7.

1279
01:11:49,207 --> 01:11:51,107
This is so bad.

1280
01:11:51,342 --> 01:11:53,173
But it feels so good.

1281
01:11:54,878 --> 01:11:56,607
We're dead, sir.

1282
01:11:59,884 --> 01:12:01,019
Yeah, we are.

1283
01:12:05,957 --> 01:12:07,185
- Okay, Tuck.
- Mm-hm.

1284
01:12:07,358 --> 01:12:10,122
Tuck. Tuck, I'm sorry.

1285
01:12:10,293 --> 01:12:11,521
I'm not this kind of girl.

1286
01:12:13,364 --> 01:12:16,026
<i>I know exactly what kind of girl you are.</i>

1287
01:12:17,067 --> 01:12:20,093
And that's why
I've completely fallen in love with you.

1288
01:12:23,140 --> 01:12:25,802
Damn.
I think that's the new British Invasion...

1289
01:12:25,976 --> 01:12:28,069
...what happened there,
that's what that was.

1290
01:12:31,715 --> 01:12:33,979
I feel like I'm having a panic attack.
- Breathe.

1291
01:12:34,151 --> 01:12:36,813
Breathe in and breathe out,
and come sit down.

1292
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:40,812
Do you think it's possible
to love two people equally?

1293
01:12:42,826 --> 01:12:44,487
Love, yes.

1294
01:12:44,661 --> 01:12:47,892
Be in love, no.

1295
01:12:49,633 --> 01:12:51,863
What do you do
when you don't know what to do?

1296
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:53,228
I ask Bob.

1297
01:12:53,537 --> 01:12:55,437
Your husband, Bob?

1298
01:12:55,605 --> 01:12:57,937
- "Bob" Bob?
- Yeah.

1299
01:12:58,108 --> 01:13:01,669
I mean, I know he's fat and ridiculous,
but he's my fat...

1300
01:13:01,845 --> 01:13:03,437
...and my ridiculous.

1301
01:13:03,613 --> 01:13:06,741
And I like the way that I am with him.

1302
01:13:06,916 --> 01:13:08,850
Mom, could you fix this?
- Hey, buddy.

1303
01:13:11,621 --> 01:13:13,282
Don't choose the better guy.

1304
01:13:13,689 --> 01:13:16,920
Choose the guy that's gonna make you
the better girl.

1305
01:13:17,561 --> 01:13:19,392
- Right?
- Right.

1306
01:13:20,664 --> 01:13:21,995
<i>I love you?</i>

1307
01:13:22,965 --> 01:13:27,095
Pretty fancy words to get the girl in bed.
Bravo. Well done. Good performance.

1308
01:13:27,270 --> 01:13:30,706
- I don't expect you to understand.
- Why can't you just admit you lost?

1309
01:13:30,873 --> 01:13:35,139
I didn't. I was doing well until you turned
up with your big hair and your white teeth.

1310
01:13:35,312 --> 01:13:36,643
As per usual.

1311
01:13:36,812 --> 01:13:40,873
- Let's not forget, yes, I did find her first.
- Yeah, but she fell for me, Tuck.

1312
01:13:41,051 --> 01:13:44,248
She fell for me. It's not my fault
you're always a step behind.

1313
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:47,787
If I'm only a step behind,
it's because I'm cleaning up after you.

1314
01:13:53,562 --> 01:13:55,029
Do you know what?

1315
01:13:55,297 --> 01:13:58,698
I couldn't give a monkey
who Lauren chooses between us.

1316
01:13:59,001 --> 01:14:01,902
But this, what we had....

1317
01:14:02,071 --> 01:14:04,904
- Yeah, what?
- It's over.

1318
01:14:06,008 --> 01:14:07,839
I already asked Collins for a transfer.

1319
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:18,215
- Lauren. How are you? Are you well?
<i>- Hi. Oh, I'm pretty good.</i>

1320
01:14:18,387 --> 01:14:19,718
- Good.
<i>- Are you busy?</i>

1321
01:14:19,888 --> 01:14:22,083
- No, no, I'm just at work.
<i>- What are you doing?</i>

1322
01:14:22,258 --> 01:14:24,988
Oh, nothing much.
A bit boring, to be honest.

1323
01:14:25,161 --> 01:14:27,857
<i>- Do you know that new place on Third?</i>
- I know it very well.

1324
01:14:28,029 --> 01:14:30,623
<i>- Can you meet me there?</i>
- I can be there in half an hour.

1325
01:14:30,799 --> 01:14:33,461
<i>- Okay. I'll see you for lunch then.</i>
- That would be lovely.

1326
01:14:33,635 --> 01:14:35,569
<i>- I'll see you there.</i>
- All right, my love.

1327
01:14:35,737 --> 01:14:36,863
<i>- Bye.</i>
- Bye.

1328
01:14:40,709 --> 01:14:41,767
She called you.

1329
01:14:46,015 --> 01:14:47,744
Gotta go, mate.

1330
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:50,615
Have to pack up anyway.

1331
01:15:06,701 --> 01:15:09,192
Lucky water bottle.

1332
01:15:10,205 --> 01:15:11,934
<i>Anyway, she is a brilliant mother.</i>

1333
01:15:12,106 --> 01:15:13,130
What are you doing?

1334
01:15:13,308 --> 01:15:15,401
Watching last night's
surveillance video on Tuck.

1335
01:15:15,577 --> 01:15:19,035
Time to close the books on that one,
Dickerman. She got away.

1336
01:15:21,382 --> 01:15:25,682
All right, Dick,
I'll see you when I see you.

1337
01:15:26,387 --> 01:15:29,254
<i>I had a really fantastic day today.
Thank you very, very much.</i>

1338
01:15:29,424 --> 01:15:32,882
<i>- So did I. It was fun.</i>
<i>- It was.</i>

1339
01:15:33,161 --> 01:15:35,026
<i>I, well....</i>

1340
01:15:35,196 --> 01:15:37,926
- Scroll back for a second.
<i>- Yeah, so....</i>

1341
01:15:38,099 --> 01:15:39,896
- Now zoom in.
- There?

1342
01:15:40,334 --> 01:15:42,632
No, no, on the background.

1343
01:15:43,671 --> 01:15:45,468
Freeze that and enhance.

1344
01:15:51,012 --> 01:15:52,843
That's Heinrich.

1345
01:15:54,581 --> 01:15:56,583
He's here. I have to get Tuck.

1346
01:15:57,151 --> 01:15:59,244
I'm really glad you called.

1347
01:15:59,854 --> 01:16:01,822
I didn't expect you to. It was a surprise.

1348
01:16:01,989 --> 01:16:03,013
- Really?
- Yeah.

1349
01:16:03,190 --> 01:16:05,158
Which is great, because I love surprises.

1350
01:16:05,326 --> 01:16:06,486
You do? Gosh, I don't.

1351
01:16:06,661 --> 01:16:08,458
Usually, they turn out more bad than...

1352
01:16:09,630 --> 01:16:10,654
Good grief.

1353
01:16:10,831 --> 01:16:11,957
- Hi.
- Hi.

1354
01:16:12,132 --> 01:16:14,600
FDR, what are you...?

1355
01:16:14,769 --> 01:16:17,704
Uh, I'm sorry. Tuck, this is my friend FDR.

1356
01:16:17,871 --> 01:16:18,997
FDR, this is Tuck.

1357
01:16:19,172 --> 01:16:22,005
- Hello, it's lovely to meet you.
- Lovely to meet you.

1358
01:16:22,543 --> 01:16:24,704
- Are you British?
- Yes, I am.

1359
01:16:25,045 --> 01:16:26,273
That's a crying shame.

1360
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:28,705
Why?
- Oh, no reason.

1361
01:16:30,017 --> 01:16:32,542
You have...
You have very gentle hands, don't you?

1362
01:16:32,719 --> 01:16:34,152
- Strong hands.
- Gentle hands.

1363
01:16:34,321 --> 01:16:36,983
Strong hands. Gentle hands.
It's like holding a salmon.

1364
01:16:37,157 --> 01:16:39,682
Can you excuse me for just a second?
I'm just gonna, um....

1365
01:16:39,860 --> 01:16:43,023
Just a minute, for a second.

1366
01:16:44,463 --> 01:16:45,828
Order me a drink.

1367
01:16:45,999 --> 01:16:48,934
In a shot. I'll be right back.

1368
01:16:51,937 --> 01:16:53,302
<i>Oh, so horny.</i>

1369
01:16:53,473 --> 01:16:54,735
<i>Oh, so horny.</i>

1370
01:16:56,510 --> 01:16:57,738
- Hello.
<i>- Trish.</i>

1371
01:16:57,911 --> 01:17:01,005
They're both here. You gotta get over here.
I'm hyperventilating.

1372
01:17:01,181 --> 01:17:03,809
I told you you shouldn't date two guys
at the same time.

1373
01:17:03,984 --> 01:17:05,144
What?

1374
01:17:05,319 --> 01:17:08,686
You have neither the grace nor the humility
to lose like a man, do you?

1375
01:17:08,855 --> 01:17:10,618
It's Heinrich.

1376
01:17:10,791 --> 01:17:12,816
He's in L.A.
We have to get on it right now.

1377
01:17:12,993 --> 01:17:15,188
You know, you are incredible.
Really, you are.

1378
01:17:15,361 --> 01:17:17,886
I have to take my hat off to you.
This is impressive.

1379
01:17:18,065 --> 01:17:19,726
- Listen.
- You take your hands off me.

1380
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:22,960
- This is not... Tuck. Tuck.
- Take your hand off me, mate.

1381
01:17:23,135 --> 01:17:24,500
Yeah?

1382
01:17:27,741 --> 01:17:30,574
- Yeah, all right.
- Where you going? Hey, where you going?

1383
01:17:31,344 --> 01:17:32,368
Hm?

1384
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:51,259
You can do this. You are a confident
woman who can deal with conflict.

1385
01:17:51,430 --> 01:17:53,159
I'm gonna pass out.

1386
01:17:53,332 --> 01:17:55,357
Has that been on my teeth
the whole time?

1387
01:17:58,170 --> 01:18:01,367
Get out there. Tell them your decision.
They're rational.

1388
01:18:03,275 --> 01:18:04,902
They may even become friends.

1389
01:18:07,546 --> 01:18:09,207
They'll probably just shake hands.

1390
01:18:12,484 --> 01:18:14,315
My boobs are sweating.

1391
01:18:29,802 --> 01:18:32,999
I should have killed you in Kandahar
when I had the chance.

1392
01:18:33,172 --> 01:18:36,630
What? Were you having a laugh, mate?

1393
01:18:37,510 --> 01:18:40,138
I was the only thing keeping you alive
in Kandahar, mate.

1394
01:18:40,312 --> 01:18:41,745
I was your only friend.

1395
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:43,738
Friend?

1396
01:18:45,751 --> 01:18:48,276
- You two know each other?
- Well, Lauren....

1397
01:18:48,453 --> 01:18:51,320
- You two know each other?
- Yes.

1398
01:18:51,489 --> 01:18:53,855
What was this?
Some sort of bet? Some sort of game?

1399
01:18:54,026 --> 01:18:55,926
To see who could get the girl first?

1400
01:18:56,094 --> 01:18:57,152
- No, no, no.
- Lauren...

1401
01:18:57,328 --> 01:18:58,886
- ...let me explain.
- Let me explain.

1402
01:18:59,063 --> 01:19:03,124
- I'm really... No, actually... You've done...
- Lauren, listen... Shut up.

1403
01:19:03,435 --> 01:19:05,164
I trusted you.

1404
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:09,766
Lauren. Lauren.

1405
01:19:14,946 --> 01:19:16,777
<i>It's worse. They know each other.</i>

1406
01:19:16,949 --> 01:19:18,416
- What?
- I don't know how.

1407
01:19:18,583 --> 01:19:20,983
I got... I walked in
and they said they were friends.

1408
01:19:21,152 --> 01:19:22,346
Here, drink this.

1409
01:19:25,056 --> 01:19:27,957
- Oh, my God, what is that?
- It's a screwdriver.

1410
01:19:28,126 --> 01:19:29,218
It's mostly vodka.

1411
01:19:29,394 --> 01:19:32,886
But I'm sure there's some apple juice
or something in there from somewhere.

1412
01:19:33,298 --> 01:19:36,131
I feel like an idiot. I thought they cared.
Can we get out?

1413
01:19:36,301 --> 01:19:39,668
Yeah, sure, we could just go to a bar...
What...?

1414
01:19:41,539 --> 01:19:43,564
- Oh, my God.
- What...?

1415
01:19:44,976 --> 01:19:47,410
Excuse me.
Is there something I can help you with?

1416
01:19:47,578 --> 01:19:49,842
- Just give him your keys.
- I don't want the car.

1417
01:19:50,014 --> 01:19:52,244
I want your boyfriends.

1418
01:19:55,953 --> 01:19:59,223
Don't talk to me, mate. In fact,
don't ever talk to me again. Don't...

1419
01:20:03,827 --> 01:20:07,558
- Is that Sade?
- Sade is not exclusive, my friend. Jesus.

1420
01:20:08,131 --> 01:20:10,895
- Ah, look.
- Put it on speaker.

1421
01:20:11,068 --> 01:20:12,126
All right.

1422
01:20:12,769 --> 01:20:15,397
Hi, Lauren, I'm really, really sorry
about what happened.

1423
01:20:15,572 --> 01:20:17,972
Lauren, it's FDR.
I am so sorry about what happened.

1424
01:20:18,141 --> 01:20:21,440
- Would you just be quiet?
- Come on, maybe she wants to talk to me.

1425
01:20:21,613 --> 01:20:23,513
Why didn't she call your phone then?

1426
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:24,942
- I don't know.
- Shut up.

1427
01:20:25,115 --> 01:20:26,173
You shut up.

1428
01:20:26,350 --> 01:20:28,716
- Lauren...
<i>- No, you shut up.</i>

1429
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:33,656
You two come alone unarmed
to Warehouse 22 in San Pedro.

1430
01:20:33,824 --> 01:20:36,554
Or I'll have to kill your pretty girlfriend
and her friend.

1431
01:20:36,727 --> 01:20:39,423
<i>I see any police,
any agent within a mile...</i>

1432
01:20:39,596 --> 01:20:41,359
...you get her head in the mail.

1433
01:20:41,532 --> 01:20:42,624
Be there in an hour.

1434
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:46,397
If we go to that warehouse,
she's not walking out and neither are we.

1435
01:20:47,004 --> 01:20:49,700
- What is that?
- GPS. I put a sat-tracker on her.

1436
01:20:49,873 --> 01:20:51,238
You put a sat-tracker on her?

1437
01:20:51,408 --> 01:20:53,205
- Of course I did, didn't you?
- No.

1438
01:20:53,377 --> 01:20:57,143
I didn't put a sat-tracker on her. That's immoral.
I put one on her cell phone.

1439
01:20:57,314 --> 01:20:59,407
- Steal this car, Tuck.
- Got it.

1440
01:21:00,951 --> 01:21:03,078
- Thank you.
- She's heading eastbound on Venice.

1441
01:21:03,253 --> 01:21:05,278
- Try not to screw this up.
- You try not to.

1442
01:21:05,455 --> 01:21:06,683
Stop repeating everything that I say.

1443
01:21:07,490 --> 01:21:09,458
FDR, target is holding steady.

1444
01:21:09,626 --> 01:21:10,786
One mile to contact.

1445
01:21:11,194 --> 01:21:13,162
Tuck, negative, 0.8 miles to be precise.

1446
01:21:18,502 --> 01:21:20,470
Get me close.
I'm gonna pull a Monte Carlo.

1447
01:21:20,636 --> 01:21:23,332
Negative, we don't have the angle.
Do a reverse Karachi.

1448
01:21:23,673 --> 01:21:25,140
Fine. Just get me close.

1449
01:21:36,519 --> 01:21:38,510
No! What are you doing? No!

1450
01:21:40,556 --> 01:21:43,252
- Trish!
- Got it.

1451
01:21:48,798 --> 01:21:51,858
Shit!

1452
01:22:11,953 --> 01:22:13,716
Drive, you idiot!

1453
01:22:19,427 --> 01:22:21,452
What the hell is going on?

1454
01:22:21,631 --> 01:22:23,826
I'm gonna be honest.
I am not a travel agent.

1455
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,900
- Really?
- I'm not a cruise ship captain.

1456
01:22:26,067 --> 01:22:27,125
No shit.

1457
01:22:29,138 --> 01:22:30,730
Oh, my God!

1458
01:22:31,807 --> 01:22:33,468
- Oh, God.
- Okay.

1459
01:22:33,642 --> 01:22:34,904
Grab the wheel, please.

1460
01:22:35,076 --> 01:22:38,534
Girl, I've seen you drive. Take the wheel.
- I'm not gonna drive this car.

1461
01:22:40,949 --> 01:22:42,211
Turn around.
- Shit!

1462
01:22:44,452 --> 01:22:45,817
Tuck!

1463
01:22:53,229 --> 01:22:55,288
- I missed you.
- I know. I've missed you too.

1464
01:22:55,463 --> 01:22:57,021
- I love you, man.
- Love you too.

1465
01:22:57,198 --> 01:23:00,167
We're back.
- Oh, my God. I'm Yoko.

1466
01:23:09,078 --> 01:23:11,410
<i>Good afternoon, I'm Susan
Walsh coming to you live from the studio....</i>

1467
01:23:11,613 --> 01:23:14,104
- Mom.
- Yeah?

1468
01:23:14,282 --> 01:23:17,012
- Is that Dad?
- Huh?

1469
01:23:17,452 --> 01:23:20,216
Where are they going?
- Headed south on the 310 Freeway.

1470
01:23:20,388 --> 01:23:22,253
But that freeway's incomplete.

1471
01:23:24,758 --> 01:23:27,192
Three hundred feet, 200.
They're running out of road.

1472
01:23:56,323 --> 01:23:58,814
I hope you can forgive him, Lauren.

1473
01:23:58,993 --> 01:24:01,223
- He's the best man I know.
- Bollocks, mate.

1474
01:24:01,395 --> 01:24:04,831
You two belong to each other.
You really do, you belong to each other.

1475
01:24:04,998 --> 01:24:06,989
Thank you,
she's already made her choice.

1476
01:24:07,168 --> 01:24:09,159
No. No, I didn't.

1477
01:24:10,137 --> 01:24:11,866
- You didn't?
- You didn't?

1478
01:24:12,906 --> 01:24:15,397
- What?
- No, I mean, I did, but...

1479
01:24:16,477 --> 01:24:19,674
- In light of everything I found out, I feel...
- Tuck.

1480
01:24:30,390 --> 01:24:32,950
- It's bulletproof.
- The lights.

1481
01:24:34,128 --> 01:24:35,322
Shoot the headlights.

1482
01:24:35,996 --> 01:24:40,399
Front-impact airbag deployment
in all models after 2006.

1483
01:25:21,841 --> 01:25:22,967
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1484
01:25:23,743 --> 01:25:25,768
- Good.
- Yeah.

1485
01:25:27,181 --> 01:25:28,876
I'm okay.

1486
01:25:42,162 --> 01:25:43,356
All right, get a room.

1487
01:25:48,034 --> 01:25:51,629
<i>We do not know how it started.</i>
- I don't think he's a travel agent.

1488
01:25:51,804 --> 01:25:54,204
<i>It may have involved
a German terrorist group...</i>

1489
01:25:54,373 --> 01:25:56,342
<i>...as well as two federal agents.</i>

1490
01:26:00,046 --> 01:26:02,276
- Let me take a look at that, sir?
- No, I'm fine.

1491
01:26:09,789 --> 01:26:12,121
I was gonna tell you.
That's why I asked you out.

1492
01:26:12,791 --> 01:26:15,385
Yeah, it's okay. I, um....

1493
01:26:16,762 --> 01:26:18,696
It's good. It's good. I understand.

1494
01:26:19,197 --> 01:26:20,789
- Okay.
- It's good.

1495
01:26:23,436 --> 01:26:24,903
Does Joe know about this?

1496
01:26:25,071 --> 01:26:26,732
Um....

1497
01:26:27,539 --> 01:26:28,836
No.

1498
01:26:29,007 --> 01:26:31,237
No, not yet,
but I think he will in a minute.

1499
01:26:33,378 --> 01:26:34,811
All right.

1500
01:26:35,247 --> 01:26:39,650
I should... I should probably...
I should probably head off.

1501
01:26:40,219 --> 01:26:41,709
Okay.

1502
01:26:43,455 --> 01:26:44,479
Good.

1503
01:26:44,656 --> 01:26:45,918
Take care.

1504
01:26:46,092 --> 01:26:47,559
Hey, Tuck.

1505
01:26:51,763 --> 01:26:56,223
I'll, uh, take care of all this.

1506
01:26:56,401 --> 01:26:57,925
Thank you.

1507
01:26:58,670 --> 01:27:00,069
All right.

1508
01:27:01,340 --> 01:27:03,865
I'll see you... I'll see you in the office?

1509
01:27:04,042 --> 01:27:05,270
No.

1510
01:27:08,580 --> 01:27:10,673
I'll see you in the field, mate.

1511
01:27:11,082 --> 01:27:13,414
- Come here, you.
- Come here, you.

1512
01:27:13,718 --> 01:27:15,686
- I love you.
- I love you too.

1513
01:27:15,854 --> 01:27:19,312
- You're family always and forever.
- Yeah. So are you.

1514
01:27:22,260 --> 01:27:23,921
- Take care.
- You take care of her.

1515
01:27:26,798 --> 01:27:28,356
So....

1516
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:31,132
So when I added it all up
and I crunched all the numbers, it was a...

1517
01:27:31,302 --> 01:27:34,169
Shh. No more thinking.

1518
01:27:48,018 --> 01:27:50,486
You're gonna make me regret this,
aren't you?

1519
01:27:51,022 --> 01:27:53,149
For the rest of your life.

1520
01:28:12,376 --> 01:28:14,241
Did you see that? You see, it worked.

1521
01:28:14,412 --> 01:28:16,676
- It worked. You see that?
- What'd I tell you? Hm?

1522
01:28:17,448 --> 01:28:20,178
You happy?
All right, go get your sneakers. Go on.

1523
01:28:20,351 --> 01:28:23,912
- You're not listening to me.
- Mate, can I have a quick word with you?

1524
01:28:25,189 --> 01:28:26,656
That's it, stand up.

1525
01:28:28,492 --> 01:28:32,690
A brave man once said to me,
"Pain is weakness leaving the body."

1526
01:28:33,831 --> 01:28:35,458
Bye, weakness.

1527
01:28:36,300 --> 01:28:38,530
Weakness leaving the body.

1528
01:28:38,702 --> 01:28:40,795
You go on. Talk to your friends for a bit.

1529
01:28:45,542 --> 01:28:46,873
Hey.

1530
01:28:49,780 --> 01:28:51,372
So you're not a travel agent?

1531
01:28:51,914 --> 01:28:54,542
- No.
- Mm-hm.

1532
01:28:54,718 --> 01:28:57,619
Um.... This is me.

1533
01:29:04,028 --> 01:29:06,553
Hi, um, I'm Katie.

1534
01:29:10,567 --> 01:29:12,432
Hello. I'm Tuck. Pleased to meet you.

1535
01:29:12,603 --> 01:29:14,230
- Tuck?
- That's right. Yeah.

1536
01:29:14,404 --> 01:29:17,032
So nice to meet you. Finally.

1537
01:29:18,008 --> 01:29:20,568
- You hungry?
- Yes, I am.

1538
01:29:21,611 --> 01:29:25,638
Well, you wanna get some dinner?
As a family?

1539
01:29:26,316 --> 01:29:27,476
Yes, yes, I would.

1540
01:29:27,817 --> 01:29:29,341
Okay, good.

1541
01:29:33,991 --> 01:29:36,016
Okay, bud, time to go.

1542
01:29:56,645 --> 01:29:58,306
Hello?

1543
01:29:59,148 --> 01:30:01,981
Hey, babe,
you're using the vector chute, right?

1544
01:30:02,151 --> 01:30:03,175
Yeah, of course.

1545
01:30:03,352 --> 01:30:06,253
It's got high-tensile fiber
and triple-secure locking features.

1546
01:30:06,422 --> 01:30:07,946
It gets fives across the board.

1547
01:30:08,124 --> 01:30:10,183
Oh, God, I love it when you talk dirty.

1548
01:30:10,660 --> 01:30:15,154
Ha, ha. Oh, Nana's tomorrow night. Don't
forget to tell Tuck to bring Katie and Joe.

1549
01:30:15,331 --> 01:30:18,630
- Hey, Nana's tomorrow night, huh?
- Is that Nana you're talking to?

1550
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:20,062
No.

1551
01:30:20,635 --> 01:30:22,193
Did you tell him yet?

1552
01:30:23,139 --> 01:30:25,767
- I'm just about to.
- Good luck.

1553
01:30:25,941 --> 01:30:27,169
I love you, baby.

1554
01:30:27,342 --> 01:30:29,333
- I love you, baby.
- Bye.

1555
01:30:29,512 --> 01:30:32,879
Ah! I'm gonna throw you
the best bachelorette party ever!

1556
01:30:33,048 --> 01:30:38,816
- Are you sure that we should do this?
- Have I ever, ever, ever steered you wrong?

1557
01:30:39,755 --> 01:30:40,847
- Brother.
- Yo.

1558
01:30:41,022 --> 01:30:43,115
I asked Lauren to marry me.

1559
01:30:43,291 --> 01:30:45,555
Will you be my best man?

1560
01:30:48,096 --> 01:30:51,725
- Jump run!
- Hey, you're good.

1561
01:30:51,900 --> 01:30:55,859
I know it's a little awkward with you having
slept with her and everything, but....

1562
01:30:56,037 --> 01:31:00,406
- Don't worry about it, Lauren didn't even...
- I just think it's poetic justice, right?

1563
01:31:00,575 --> 01:31:01,633
What is?

1564
01:31:01,977 --> 01:31:08,143
Well, I've been meaning to tell you this
for a while, but I slept with Katie.

1565
01:31:09,250 --> 01:31:12,048
Once. Long time ago.
Before you guys even knew each other.

1566
01:31:12,220 --> 01:31:14,745
- Slept with my wife?
- She wasn't. You didn't know her.

1567
01:31:14,923 --> 01:31:17,391
- You slept with my wife?
- It was a long time ago, man.

1568
01:31:17,559 --> 01:31:19,356
I never even slept with Lauren.

1569
01:31:19,728 --> 01:31:22,993
- What?
- I never slept with Lauren!

1570
01:31:24,532 --> 01:31:28,730
No, I only let you think that, right?
Think that, to make you jealous.

1571
01:31:29,404 --> 01:31:32,066
- You never slept with Lauren?
- You slept with my wife!

1572
01:31:34,409 --> 01:31:35,808
<i>I need you to look.</i>

1573
01:31:36,411 --> 01:31:38,345
<i>In my head.</i>

1574
01:31:39,380 --> 01:31:41,780
<i>Before you came along.</i>

1575
01:31:42,284 --> 01:31:44,582
<i>Felt like I was dead</i>

1576
01:31:45,719 --> 01:31:48,210
<i>I got good love.</i>

1577
01:31:48,889 --> 01:31:51,153
<i>Rock 'n' roll.</i>

1578
01:31:52,227 --> 01:31:55,492
<i>Well, I met a sweet girl.</i>

1579
01:31:56,764 --> 01:31:58,994
<i>She blew my mind.</i>

1580
01:31:59,868 --> 01:32:02,132
<i>And we've been hangin' out.</i>

1581
01:32:02,770 --> 01:32:05,295
<i>Ever since that time.</i>

1582
01:32:06,174 --> 01:32:08,438
<i>We got good love.</i>

1583
01:32:09,143 --> 01:32:11,907
<i>Rock 'n' roll.</i>

1584
01:32:12,213 --> 01:32:15,148
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

1585
01:32:15,916 --> 01:32:18,180
<i>Sweet, sweet love.</i>

1586
01:32:19,019 --> 01:32:20,919
<i>Sweet, sweet love.</i>

1587
01:32:22,223 --> 01:32:24,350
<i>Sweet, sweet love.</i>

1588
01:32:25,526 --> 01:32:29,986
<i>Sweet, sweet love.</i>

1589
01:32:30,036 --> 01:32:34,586
