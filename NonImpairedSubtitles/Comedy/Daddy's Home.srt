1
00:00:48,781 --> 00:00:50,316
<i>Here's a question
for you.</i>

2
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:54,521
<i>What do kids need more?
A father or a dad?</i>

3
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,490
<i>What's the difference?</i>

4
00:00:56,522 --> 00:00:58,558
<i>The way I see it, darn near
anyone can be a father...</i>

5
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:02,262
<i>...but not everyone has the
patience or the devotion to be a dad.</i>

6
00:01:02,762 --> 00:01:03,930
<i>As for me...</i>

7
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:05,231
Anybody caught
a Monarch yet?

8
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:07,034
<i>...I've always wanted
to be a dad.</i>

9
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,568
<i>Let me tell you,
I love it!</i>

10
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:10,704
Yeah!

11
00:01:12,106 --> 00:01:14,174
<i>And I love my Ford Flex.</i>

12
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:16,343
<i>It treats me to a smooth ride,
and you know what?</i>

13
00:01:16,377 --> 00:01:18,312
<i>It didn't break the bank.</i>

14
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:20,312
<i>Room enough for
the whole family.</i>

15
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:22,315
<i>Yes, I love
being a dad.</i>

16
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,753
<i>And I love these two adorable
little rays of sunshine.</i>

17
00:01:29,021 --> 00:01:30,457
Hey, Dylan!
Good morning.

18
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,359
Whatever.

19
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:34,528
<i>Okay.
I'm not their real dad.</i>

20
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:36,596
Good morning,
Mr. Whitaker.

21
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:37,764
<i>I'm their stepdad.</i>

22
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:38,899
Good morning, Megan.

23
00:01:38,931 --> 00:01:41,168
Can you please
put this on the fridge?

24
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:44,839
Well, sure. Did you do
another drawing of our family?

25
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:49,609
That's me and Dylan and Mommy.

26
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:50,809
So great.

27
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:53,514
And over here,
far, far away,

28
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:55,347
is you.

29
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:58,785
And am I wearing
a baseball cap?

30
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:01,621
That's the knife in your head
'cause I was killing you in the eye.

31
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:03,890
I see.

32
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:05,226
Well, I love how you
drew my hair.

33
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:08,162
That's poop.

34
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:10,763
Well, it's well-drawn. And
I'm guessing it's dog poop?

35
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,331
That's homeless man poop.

36
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:15,436
All right.

37
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:19,005
<i>I actually can't
father my own children,</i>

38
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:22,109
<i>ever since I hit a little
snafu at a dental office.</i>

39
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,476
I've got
a little bit of a gag reflex.

40
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,912
Close your eyes, breathe through
your nose, you'll be fine.

41
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:27,213
Okay.

42
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:36,190
You got a really
weird tongue.

43
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:37,725
You need to floss better.

44
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:39,492
<i>Ever since then,
my testicles have been</i>

45
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:40,893
<i>more decorative
than anything else.</i>

46
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:42,362
Hey!

47
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:44,698
<i>And I thought I'd
never have a family.</i>

48
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:47,700
<i>Until I met a stunning
mom named Sara.</i>

49
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:50,771
<i>Would you look at her?</i>

50
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:53,574
<i>I am one lucky so-and-so.
I hit the jackpot.</i>

51
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:54,574
Hi.

52
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:55,208
Hi.

53
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:57,277
Sorry I'm taking
so long.

54
00:02:57,311 --> 00:02:59,279
I have to show that Sixty West
building to those new clients.

55
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:00,481
I know.

56
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:01,814
My God!
The kids' lunches.

57
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:03,450
Already packed.
I wrote them

58
00:03:03,484 --> 00:03:05,985
little inspirational notes
to start them on their day.

59
00:03:06,018 --> 00:03:07,754
They've already eaten their
breakfasts, and you look perfect.

60
00:03:08,656 --> 00:03:09,756
You are amazing.

61
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:14,027
Look at this?
Another family drawing.

62
00:03:14,059 --> 00:03:16,428
No.
I am so sorry.

63
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:18,931
No, I think you're misunderstanding.
This is the first drawing

64
00:03:18,964 --> 00:03:21,195
where I'm not dead already.

65
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:23,469
Sure, I've got
a knife in my eye

66
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:24,872
and some homeless man
poop on my head,

67
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:28,641
but this is
showing real progress.

68
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,809
I think she's starting
to accept me.

69
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:33,012
You can find the good
in just about anything.

70
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,782
I love that about you.
You know that?

71
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:36,650
Thanks.

72
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,733
Hello. I'm home.

73
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:28,202
Hey.

74
00:04:28,767 --> 00:04:29,803
How was the...

75
00:04:32,638 --> 00:04:33,873
What's wrong?

76
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:35,575
He won't talk to me. He said
he only wants to talk to you.

77
00:04:37,476 --> 00:04:38,678
You want to talk to me?

78
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:40,347
Really?

79
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,115
You mean me
and your mom?

80
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:43,784
Just me? By myself?

81
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:45,251
Sure. I'm...

82
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:49,422
I'm totally free. Let's go
to the den. We'll sit there.

83
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,391
We'll sit. We can do it
sitting or standing?

84
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,361
Doesn't matter.
We're just gonna do it.

85
00:04:54,395 --> 00:04:56,630
We're not gonna overthink it.
Yeah. Great. Okay, good.

86
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:01,734
Just the men, yeah.
A little rap session. Great.

87
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:03,604
My God.

88
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:09,509
I just want you to know that I'm
just here to listen. All right?

89
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:12,746
No judgments, no lectures,
just a compassionate ear.

90
00:05:14,046 --> 00:05:16,282
Well, there are these
kids at school...

91
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:17,450
and they're
bigger than me,

92
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:18,484
because they're
fourth graders.

93
00:05:18,517 --> 00:05:20,287
And...

94
00:05:22,287 --> 00:05:23,623
Was that weird?

95
00:05:24,323 --> 00:05:25,592
I'm sorry, I'm just...

96
00:05:26,325 --> 00:05:28,128
It's a big moment for me,

97
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,462
and I'm just trying
to capture it.

98
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,597
It just came off
awkward.

99
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:35,268
So, go ahead, continue telling
your story. Fourth graders.

100
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:37,270
Anyway, there are
these fourth graders, and...

101
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:39,106
He actually
confided in me.

102
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:42,475
I mean, it was that father-son
feeling I've been dying for,

103
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:45,678
and it was even better than
I thought it was gonna be.

104
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:48,147
I mean,
he really needed me. Me.

105
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,515
That is so great, honey.

106
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:50,851
He even said
not to tell you.

107
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:52,718
So I'm actually totally

108
00:05:52,751 --> 00:05:54,887
betraying his trust right now.

109
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:56,991
What are we gonna do about those
little snot-nosed fourth graders?

110
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:58,625
I think it's
going to be fine.

111
00:05:58,657 --> 00:06:02,494
He's going to try to do some
trust falls on the playground.

112
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:03,630
Really? You think
that's gonna work?

113
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:05,832
As long as they
catch him. Yeah.

114
00:06:05,864 --> 00:06:06,734
Hey, Brad.

115
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:08,734
Yeah?

116
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:12,038
If I ask you something, you
promise you won't cry again?

117
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:13,640
Of course, sweetie.
What is it?

118
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:16,508
Well, at school, they
told us about this thing,

119
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,010
and it's called
a Daddy-Daughter Dance.

120
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:21,748
So, do you want to
go with me?

121
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,351
You said you
wouldn't cry, Brad.

122
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:29,289
I'm not. Megan, yes.
A million times yes.

123
00:06:29,323 --> 00:06:31,392
I thought big people
weren't supposed to cry.

124
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:33,893
I think it's sweet that he's
crying like a little bitch.

125
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:35,528
Megan!

126
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,763
You are not supposed
to call people that word.

127
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:40,433
You know what? It takes a
real man to show his emotions.

128
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:45,772
All right,
that's a bit much.

129
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:48,140
<i>No more rhymes now,
I mean it!</i>

130
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:49,275
<i>Anybody want a peanut?</i>

131
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:54,782
<i>We were finally
becoming a family.</i>

132
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:56,817
I'll get it!

133
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:59,952
<i>After being pushed away
and treated like an outsider,</i>

134
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:02,188
<i>I was finally becoming the dad
that I always knew I could...</i>

135
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:03,390
Daddy!

136
00:07:03,989 --> 00:07:05,925
Hi! Where are you?

137
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,095
Where's Cameroon?

138
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:10,464
Is that gunfire? Cool!

139
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:12,366
Daddy, Daddy!
I want to talk to Daddy.

140
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,534
Hi, Daddy.

141
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:16,469
Good.

142
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:18,371
So your ex is
calling?

143
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:21,006
What a treat for the kids.
It's been a long time.

144
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:21,825
Yeah.

145
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:22,609
Yeah.

146
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:25,079
We're watching a really funny
movie with Mommy and Brad.

147
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:27,780
Brad is Mommy's
new husband.

148
00:07:27,813 --> 00:07:29,915
Wait. He doesn't
know about me?

149
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,652
Well, I haven't talked
to him in six months.

150
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:34,186
We've been married
eight months.

151
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:36,123
Brad, Daddy wants
to talk to you.

152
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:37,306
No! No, no. Don't, don't...

153
00:07:37,341 --> 00:07:38,457
I'm just going to say hi.

154
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:40,059
You don't need to do that.
Brad, don't.

155
00:07:40,094 --> 00:07:42,396
Thank you, sweetie.

156
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:44,565
Hello, Dusty? Super to
make your acquaintance.

157
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,467
In fact, I just wish
I could shake your hand

158
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,403
and offer to buy
you a cold one.

159
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:50,886
Tomorrow?

160
00:07:50,921 --> 00:07:51,604
What?

161
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,640
Daddy's coming! Yay!

162
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,808
Yeah, I guess
I could pick you up.

163
00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:57,443
No.

164
00:07:57,878 --> 00:07:59,212
It's Whitaker.

165
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:04,450
W-H-I-T-A-K-E-R.

166
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,652
No, I'm not comfortable
giving you

167
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:06,720
my Social Security number
over the phone.

168
00:08:07,953 --> 00:08:11,590
Okay, yeah,
my credit score is 752.

169
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,026
I'm very proud of that.

170
00:08:13,058 --> 00:08:15,996
I'm sorry? What sort of fighting
styles am I proficient in?

171
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,731
I don't know if I've ever
been asked that before.

172
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:20,767
Hello, Dusty,
hello, hello?..

173
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:23,937
I lost him.

174
00:08:23,969 --> 00:08:26,039
What just happened? Did you
just invite him to come here?

175
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:27,941
Is he coming tomorrow?

176
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:29,476
Well, I didn't know
he'd accept my offer so soon.

177
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,544
I mean, he really
jumped at it.

178
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:34,079
Remember when I said
he was like Jesse James

179
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:35,616
and Mick Jagger
had a baby?

180
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:39,219
Yeah, I just thought maybe
he was really skinny and

181
00:08:39,251 --> 00:08:42,990
jittery, and had like a little bit
of a British accent, or something.

182
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,457
He's wild and he's crazy. That's
why I fell in love with him.

183
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:46,927
Then you end up
with two kids.

184
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,461
And I'm stuck there holding the
bag and he's nowhere to be found.

185
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:51,465
It doesn't matter how much
love or passion,

186
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:52,799
or you can't breathe
without each other...

187
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:55,068
All of that stuff is
stupid in comparison.

188
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:56,501
When you have kids,
you have responsibilities.

189
00:08:56,535 --> 00:08:57,904
He doesn't understand that.

190
00:08:57,938 --> 00:08:59,806
Honey, this is actually
a good thing.

191
00:08:59,838 --> 00:09:01,641
I'll welcome Dusty
into our home,

192
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:05,111
and we'll establish some
kind but firm boundaries.

193
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:08,247
<i>All right? It's what Step-By-Stepdad
calls "setting up a Loving Fence."</i>

194
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,116
A Loving Fence? Wow, that
sounds really great, honey.

195
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,986
But your self-help books
have never met Dusty Mayron.

196
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,588
He sounds like a rascal,

197
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:16,957
but I don't think it's
anything I can't handle.

198
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:24,831
<i>Check. Check, check.</i>

199
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:27,967
Chinese Checkers,
Czech, Czech Republic, pop,

200
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,270
sibilance, sibilance, pop,
one, two, six, seven,

201
00:09:31,303 --> 00:09:32,836
check, check, check, check.

202
00:09:33,438 --> 00:09:34,940
What do you
got for me, Brad?

203
00:09:34,973 --> 00:09:38,048
Mr. Holt, hello. Well, hopefully
the new voice of The Panda.

204
00:09:38,049 --> 00:09:40,039
Listen. I gotta
leave early today.

205
00:09:40,074 --> 00:09:43,015
I gotta go pick up my
wife's ex at the airport.

206
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:46,620
Jesus, kid, how'd you
draw that shit detail?

207
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:48,721
Brad, why do you want
this deadbeat in your home?

208
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:51,491
Well, it's not that
I want him in my home,

209
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:54,061
it's just that the better
stepparenting books

210
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,329
say that the worst thing
you can do for the kids

211
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:58,430
is to push out
the biological.

212
00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:01,401
You're in the danger zone here,
Brad, and let me tell you why.

213
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,801
Kids that grow up
without their dads

214
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:05,172
always end up
obsessing over them.

215
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:07,873
Most of the hook-ups
that I've had in my adult life

216
00:10:07,906 --> 00:10:09,942
have been with women
that had daddy issues.

217
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:12,044
I don't know if this is
an appropriate story.

218
00:10:12,077 --> 00:10:13,880
Look, my wife would kill me if
she knew I was telling you this.

219
00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:15,681
Well, then you shouldn't
tell me this.

220
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:16,950
When I met her in Denver...

221
00:10:16,982 --> 00:10:18,183
You're going to tell
the story, aren't you?

222
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:19,919
she was a topless maid.

223
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,922
Ninety-nine bucks
an hour.

224
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:25,457
Never met her father.
But who did she meet? Me.

225
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:28,395
And who did treat her
like shit? Me.

226
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:29,962
I eventually loved her,

227
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:31,764
but every time
she got out of line,

228
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:34,368
I'd just pull
the Humvee over

229
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,601
and ask her to
get out politely.

230
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,571
And then I'd drive away.

231
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:41,740
Guess what? She showed up
at home every time.

232
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:44,443
This story has no relevance
to my situation.

233
00:10:44,476 --> 00:10:46,913
It doesn't at all.
It's just a good story.

234
00:10:46,947 --> 00:10:48,315
So, Pete, are we going
to hear this guy, or what?

235
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:00,961
I'm sorry.

236
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:04,598
Keep it up, Brad. You and I
will fight in the parking lot.

237
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,233
So today is the day

238
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:09,635
I'm finally meeting
the father of my children.

239
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,405
Am I nervous?
You're darn right I am.

240
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:15,474
But who wouldn't be?

241
00:11:15,507 --> 00:11:16,742
And here's the thing.
I mean, Pepe,

242
00:11:16,775 --> 00:11:18,878
you know, kids...

243
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:22,314
they see through things
and, at the end of the day,

244
00:11:22,347 --> 00:11:23,349
they know who's
been around...

245
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,618
Holy balls!

246
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,758
I hope that's not him.

247
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:54,347
Well, you're kind to
say that. Thank you.

248
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:57,317
Yeah, I feel pretty good.

249
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:01,921
Hey, you Dusty?

250
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:01,956
Nope.

251
00:12:02,554 --> 00:12:03,789
What?

252
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:06,093
Are you sure?

253
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:11,998
Are you Dusty...
No, you're not Dusty.

254
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:17,470
<i>You've got
Jason Sinclair on The Panda,</i>

255
00:12:17,502 --> 00:12:19,205
<i>the station everybody
in the office can agree on.</i>

256
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,907
What is this?

257
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:22,074
<i>Now if you're up in
Wolf Trap this weekend,</i>

258
00:12:22,107 --> 00:12:23,242
<i>do yourself a favor
and check out...</i>

259
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:28,248
Hey! Where have you been?

260
00:12:29,316 --> 00:12:30,450
I called you like
100 times.

261
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,084
I know, my phone died. Look...

262
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:34,153
This motorcycle,
is this...

263
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:35,222
Yes. He's here.

264
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,655
-He's here?
-Yes!

265
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:38,189
What's he doing
inside there?

266
00:12:38,223 --> 00:12:40,392
He's giving the kids
all kinds of Starbursts.

267
00:12:40,425 --> 00:12:42,461
Starbursts?
God damn it!

268
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:45,597
Sorry. Sorry.

269
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:48,400
I'm a hot habanero
pepper right now.

270
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,337
I got a few bullet points I want
to bring up with our friend Dusty,

271
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:54,274
starting with airport etiquette,
courtesy and expectation.

272
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:57,342
Good story, Daddy!

273
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,346
You like that story?
It's all true. Hey!

274
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:00,680
Who wants some
more Starbursts

275
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:03,215
and a couple of
uncirculated silver dollars?

276
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:04,651
So you are Dusty.

277
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:22,635
I sure am. You must be
the new and improved husband.

278
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:24,136
Bring it in, big guns.

279
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:27,073
I already met you
at the airport.

280
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:28,540
No, I don't recall
that, friend.

281
00:13:28,573 --> 00:13:30,543
Yeah, I walked right up to you
and asked if you were Dusty.

282
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:32,445
I'm pretty sure I'd remember
a heavy hitter like yourself.

283
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:34,815
Well, must have
been my mistake.

284
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:37,183
All right, that was me
at the airport.

285
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:38,851
Yeah, I know that.

286
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:40,553
I saw you before
you saw me,

287
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:43,089
and I'm thinking, "This is
the guy who's raising my kids?"

288
00:13:43,121 --> 00:13:44,823
"And damn it if he doesn't
look like the real deal."

289
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:46,125
I mean, look at you.

290
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,627
You figured it out,
didn't you?

291
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:50,563
-You cracked the code.
-I don't know about that.

292
00:13:50,597 --> 00:13:51,497
Don't play that
humble game with me.

293
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:54,934
He is so humble.
He's just too humble.

294
00:13:54,966 --> 00:13:58,337
Honey, you got it goin' on.
Everybody says so.

295
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,773
Yeah, I got it goin' way on.

296
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:02,575
So you can understand
why I panicked at the airport.

297
00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:04,878
I froze, Brad.
I'm sorry.

298
00:14:04,911 --> 00:14:07,414
Look, these are
tricky waters to navigate.

299
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:10,115
They sure are, man.
I mean, that is insightful.

300
00:14:10,148 --> 00:14:12,350
You know, I thought it was weird
Sara didn't tell me about you before.

301
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:13,920
I thought,
what's she hiding?

302
00:14:13,954 --> 00:14:15,022
And now I know.

303
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:17,090
A champion.

304
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:20,627
Hey, Brad!
Did you see Dad's motorcycle?

305
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:23,096
-Isn't it cool?
-It sure is.

306
00:14:24,596 --> 00:14:26,265
What is that, an Indian?

307
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:27,867
Yep.

308
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:30,070
I believe they're manufactured
in Minneapolis.

309
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,773
I've never been,
but that's

310
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:35,675
<i>the setting for
The Mary Tyler Moore Show.</i>

311
00:14:35,707 --> 00:14:38,577
<i>And... What's the other...
Rhoda.</i>

312
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:40,513
Which I want to say
was a spin-off.

313
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:44,617
Damn! You really know
your bikes, Brad. You ride?

314
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:46,119
Yeah!

315
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:46,852
Really?

316
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:47,552
Yeah.

317
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:49,922
I mean, not anymore.
I did, you know,

318
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:53,460
back in college.
I had a...

319
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:55,828
I had a Kawa-saki?
Kawasaki Nine.

320
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:57,163
Yeah.

321
00:14:57,196 --> 00:15:01,301
With the fenders and the...
The broil joint. So...

322
00:15:01,335 --> 00:15:02,569
Well, you should get
on her, man. Come on!

323
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:03,736
Take her out,
see what she can do.

324
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:04,703
She's got a lot of power.

325
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:06,205
No, no, no.

326
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,806
Yeah, Brad! Brad... Please!

327
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,109
No. Hey, come on, kids.
It's time for bed.

328
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:12,112
It's way past your bedtime.
Let's brush your teeth.

329
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:14,446
All right, come on, guys,
listen to your mom. Hey, look...

330
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,316
I don't want to overstep, but

331
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,753
it would mean the world to me if I
could tuck in our two little blessings.

332
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:25,457
Yeah. Yeah, sure, of course.
They're your kids. Tuck away.

333
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:26,859
Thank you
for that, Brad.

334
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:32,731
The King messed up.
He messed up bad.

335
00:15:32,764 --> 00:15:35,067
He thought he could just
ride off to slay dragons,

336
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,870
and his Queen would
always be waiting for him.

337
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:39,773
And then one day
the King received word

338
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:41,840
that his dominion
was being ruled over

339
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,875
by some curly-headed Step King
with good credit?

340
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:45,177
No!

341
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:46,779
Well, the King rode hard
up on his lands,

342
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:48,581
and when he arrived,

343
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,615
he did gaze fondly
upon the Queen,

344
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:52,117
remembering their
good times together,

345
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:53,786
for he had known
her in her prime,

346
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,121
when she was
down for anything,

347
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:56,422
and I do mean anything.

348
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,090
Psst...

349
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,893
Sounds like your dad's spinning
quite a yarn. Mind if I listen in?

350
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:02,329
Actually,
it's getting late.

351
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:03,595
You two need to get
some sack time.

352
00:16:03,628 --> 00:16:05,598
No, we want
more story, please!

353
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,633
Hey, I'd love to be
in here all night,

354
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:09,569
but let's be respectful
of Brad's rules,

355
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:11,937
no matter how arbitrary
they seem. All right?

356
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,673
Good night,
my little golden treasures.

357
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:20,646
Good night,
my little magical cherubs.

358
00:16:20,681 --> 00:16:22,382
Here comes some
butterfly kisses.

359
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:24,250
And some Eskimo kisses.

360
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:27,586
Good night, buddy.
Sleep tight. Sleep tight.

361
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:28,854
Hey, who wants
good-night tickles?

362
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:30,523
Me!

363
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:32,992
Good night,
my little breath of God.

364
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:34,794
Good night,
my little Jesus teardrop.

365
00:16:34,826 --> 00:16:38,730
I almost forgot, my famous
good-night back scratches.

366
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:40,667
So relaxing,
so relaxing.

367
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,901
Good night, sweetie bear.

368
00:16:41,935 --> 00:16:43,736
Hey, who wants
twenty bucks?

369
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:45,437
Twenty dollars?

370
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:46,271
What?

371
00:16:46,306 --> 00:16:47,072
Yeah.

372
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:49,408
One for you,
and one for you.

373
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:50,442
I don't know
if that's appropriate.

374
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:51,477
Don't worry about it.

375
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,311
Okay. Good night.

376
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:57,650
So, if you want to, why don't
you come by tomorrow after school?

377
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:58,784
Might be a good time to...

378
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:00,019
What about the cold one?

379
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:01,120
The cold one?

380
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:03,422
You promised me a cold
one and a handshake.

381
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:05,190
Cold one.
One cold one, coming up.

382
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:06,826
Great. I'll grab my jacket,
we'll go outside.

383
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:07,994
Perfect. All right.

384
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:10,330
Hey! Psst...

385
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:13,031
What are you doing? What
are you guys buddies now?

386
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:15,768
No. I mean,
I offered him a cold one.

387
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:18,471
I really should honor
the cold one promise.

388
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:21,941
Fine. You give him a cold one,
and then you get rid of him, okay?

389
00:17:21,975 --> 00:17:23,877
You put up your
Loving Fence, remember?

390
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:25,378
Then you come to bed.

391
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:25,413
Okay.

392
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,130
Will do.

393
00:17:27,165 --> 00:17:27,681
Okay.

394
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:33,453
What you got
going on over here?

395
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:36,956
That's a treehouse.
A little,

396
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:41,193
bonding project
for Dylan and I.

397
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,595
Yeah, we've been at it
for about two months.

398
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:44,629
It's looking good.

399
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:46,432
Thank you.

400
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:51,036
So, Dusty, how long do you think
you're going to be in town for?

401
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,040
Well, Brad, the truth is, I'm
wheels-up a week from tomorrow.

402
00:17:54,072 --> 00:17:56,309
Time to get out there and
kick some ass for America.

403
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:58,476
I see.
So you're a soldier?

404
00:17:58,511 --> 00:17:59,878
Nope.

405
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:00,914
So you're a...

406
00:18:01,112 --> 00:18:02,114
Yep.

407
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,617
Yep, what?

408
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,052
You don't want to know
any more than that, Brad.

409
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:08,055
Okay.

410
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:11,224
Listen, Dusty,

411
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:14,294
I think that we should set up
a visitation schedule.

412
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:17,797
Right? That way, you feel like you
have ample time with the children...

413
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,165
Why don't we
cut the shit, Brad?

414
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:23,170
No, we don't have
to cut the shit.

415
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:24,538
You want to know
what I'm doing here,

416
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:25,905
why don't you
quit looking at

417
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,641
whatever you wrote
on your hand?

418
00:18:27,674 --> 00:18:30,810
Be a man and ask me, Brad.

419
00:18:30,844 --> 00:18:33,547
Okay. What are
you doing here?

420
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:36,916
Now, we both know kids need a
single primary male role model.

421
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,385
Sara's made her choice.

422
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:41,222
I'm man enough to
let that role model be you.

423
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:44,491
I will vouch for you
with my children.

424
00:18:44,525 --> 00:18:46,826
I will give them my sacred
permission to trust you.

425
00:18:47,394 --> 00:18:48,695
To love you and to

426
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:51,331
call you Dad.

427
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:52,932
You'd do that for me?

428
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:53,867
No.

429
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:56,603
But I will do it for them.

430
00:18:57,538 --> 00:19:00,240
That is what you want,
isn't it, Brad?

431
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:01,875
More than anything
in the world.

432
00:19:03,343 --> 00:19:06,279
He played you. You just
got so played out there.

433
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:08,482
I know it looks that way,

434
00:19:08,516 --> 00:19:10,617
'cause I promised
I would ask him to leave,

435
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:14,121
and then I invited him to stay
for a week, but he didn't play me.

436
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,355
You know what he did?
He cut the shit.

437
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:18,057
And I gotta say,

438
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,925
it was refreshing.

439
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,296
I think more of us could stand
to just cut the shit, you know.

440
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,499
In one conversation,

441
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:27,966
he just blew by eight
chapters in my stepdad book.

442
00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:30,336
I mean, this is gonna be
so good for me and the kids.

443
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:33,739
Baby, you have no idea
who you're dancing with.

444
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:35,975
Dusty gets into your head,
that's what he does.

445
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:39,046
He has a very
impressive, rugged bravado,

446
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:42,282
there's no question.
But I gotta say,

447
00:19:42,316 --> 00:19:46,586
I think in here, there's
a soft, soft creamy center.

448
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:49,021
You know? I think
he feels a lot.

449
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:52,125
He just... He needs someone
with this, a big ear.

450
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:53,527
And I got them.

451
00:19:58,298 --> 00:20:00,032
Good morning, Dusty.

452
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:01,567
You're up and at 'em.

453
00:20:01,602 --> 00:20:04,071
Yeah, I got up early
and did a quick 20.

454
00:20:04,104 --> 00:20:06,206
-Twenty minutes of what?
-Twenty miles.

455
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:07,607
Did a little light sparring,
then I whipped up

456
00:20:07,641 --> 00:20:08,942
a pan of piping-hot
cinnamon rolls for my family.

457
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,277
And I made one for you, too.

458
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:14,414
Wow. That's very
impressive, thank you.

459
00:20:14,448 --> 00:20:15,565
Good morning, gang!

460
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,682
It smells yummy!

461
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,786
Our real dad's a super,
super-duper good cook!

462
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:21,453
Here you go, guys.

463
00:20:21,488 --> 00:20:24,691
Yeah, it looks an awful
lot like Cinnabon.

464
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:26,359
Well, thank you, Brad.
What a nice thing to say.

465
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:29,596
It tastes exactly
like Cinnabon!

466
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:32,365
In fact, same shape,
same swirl, same frosting.

467
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:33,432
Well, now you're starting
to embarrass me,

468
00:20:33,467 --> 00:20:34,535
but I do appreciate
the compliment.

469
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:37,304
Good morning,
Sar-bear!

470
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:39,272
Hey, listen, guys,

471
00:20:39,306 --> 00:20:42,042
Brad and I had a talk last night
about the importance of family.

472
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:44,411
And now that everyone's here, I
wanted to say a few words, okay?

473
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:45,913
I think that
would be great.

474
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:49,682
Hey, kids, you know, families can
be ever-growing and changing things.

475
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:52,718
And sometimes someone new
knocks on the door of your heart

476
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:55,020
and you're not sure if you
have room in there for one more.

477
00:20:55,055 --> 00:20:57,524
But there's someone here now that
I hope you guys can learn to love.

478
00:20:57,557 --> 00:20:58,424
Okay?

479
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:03,130
Come here, boy!

480
00:21:03,163 --> 00:21:04,498
A doggy! Yay!

481
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:07,500
You brought a dog home?

482
00:21:07,534 --> 00:21:09,236
Yeah. Is that a problem?

483
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:11,305
I mean, you seemed really into
it while I was teeing it up.

484
00:21:11,337 --> 00:21:12,739
No, I thought you were
talking about me.

485
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:14,606
-But you're not a dog, Brad.
-No...

486
00:21:14,641 --> 00:21:17,144
Look, last night,
when we talked...

487
00:21:17,176 --> 00:21:19,178
Yeah. Well, listen, that's
got to happen organically.

488
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:21,280
-Why can't it happen now?
-It just can't.

489
00:21:21,315 --> 00:21:22,682
You're dirty.

490
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:23,683
Dusty, how old
is that thing?

491
00:21:23,717 --> 00:21:25,819
I'd guess him
to be around 15.

492
00:21:25,852 --> 00:21:28,088
I mean, I found him this
morning, living in a storm drain.

493
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:30,323
I named him Tumor, because
of how much he grows on you.

494
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:32,392
Mommy, can we
keep Tumor, please?

495
00:21:32,425 --> 00:21:33,960
I'm gonna leave
this one up to Brad.

496
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:35,361
Please, Brad! Please!

497
00:21:36,497 --> 00:21:38,098
Why is he looking
at me like that?

498
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:40,000
He's only looking at me.

499
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:42,034
Maybe we just get
a puppy instead?

500
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:45,105
A puppy, Brad? What are they
going to learn from a puppy?

501
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:48,240
An old dog like Tumor here's been
out in the world, man. Living free.

502
00:21:48,275 --> 00:21:51,011
Fighting for survival and seeing
things we can only dream of.

503
00:21:51,044 --> 00:21:53,413
Just look at the wisdom
in those cloudy eyes.

504
00:21:53,446 --> 00:21:55,348
Besides, you know what happens
to old dogs at shelters.

505
00:21:55,382 --> 00:21:57,384
He's gonna have to walk the green
mile as soon as he gets there.

506
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,218
No, Brad, no!
Don't kill our dog!

507
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:00,553
I hate you!

508
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:03,957
Okay. Okay. Fine.

509
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:07,059
He can live out his few
remaining weeks with us.

510
00:22:07,093 --> 00:22:08,561
Yay! Thanks, Brad.

511
00:22:08,595 --> 00:22:09,730
I don't hate you anymore.

512
00:22:11,097 --> 00:22:12,331
He's going potty!

513
00:22:12,365 --> 00:22:13,799
My God.

514
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:15,369
We'll clean it up.
We don't mind.

515
00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:17,069
Look at that.

516
00:22:17,104 --> 00:22:18,739
The dog's already
teaching them responsibility.

517
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:20,973
Hey, guys, when you got to
pick up the potty, use gloves.

518
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:22,442
He's definitely got
worms in his poo.

519
00:22:31,285 --> 00:22:33,386
Dusty! Can you
please move this thing?

520
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:35,055
I can't get my car
out of the garage.

521
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:37,023
Hey, Brad, do you mind? I
want to grab a quick shower.

522
00:22:37,057 --> 00:22:38,858
Yeah, sure, no problem.

523
00:22:40,394 --> 00:22:40,927
Hey, honey.

524
00:22:40,962 --> 00:22:41,461
Hi, sweetie.

525
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:42,895
It's blocking everything.

526
00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:45,332
No, I know. I know, don't
worry. We're on top of it.

527
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:47,433
What are you doing?
Brad, I don't...

528
00:22:48,335 --> 00:22:50,104
Hey! Stay away
from that, please.

529
00:22:52,105 --> 00:22:53,406
Honey, what are you doing?

530
00:22:55,275 --> 00:22:56,976
I don't know if that's
a good idea, Brad.

531
00:22:57,009 --> 00:22:58,478
Dusty!

532
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,847
It's vibrating up
into my shoulders.

533
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:04,550
Hey, it's okay, Brad. Look,
she's a lot of bike, man.

534
00:23:04,585 --> 00:23:06,119
No, I'm good. Why don't you go
back in and take that shower,

535
00:23:06,152 --> 00:23:07,821
so you can get a shirt on?

536
00:23:07,854 --> 00:23:09,389
You got it. Hey, you
look good on that, man.

537
00:23:09,422 --> 00:23:10,722
Remember, one down, four up.

538
00:23:10,757 --> 00:23:12,625
Dusty, everyone knows
it's one down...

539
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:15,994
Watch out! Watch out!
Watch out!

540
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:32,211
Did Brad just die?

541
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:35,148
I think we all need to prepare ourselves
for that possibility, pumpkin. Okay?

542
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:37,551
Brad!

543
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:40,620
Brad!

544
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:47,227
My God.

545
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,427
Brad, are you all right?

546
00:23:48,461 --> 00:23:51,864
No, I'm not all right.
I'm in the wall. I'm scared.

547
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:53,466
Honey.

548
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,501
Jeez, Brad, I thought
you said you could ride.

549
00:23:55,536 --> 00:23:57,403
I can ride, okay.
Would you get a shirt on?

550
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:58,871
I think if you could ride,

551
00:23:58,905 --> 00:24:00,740
you wouldn't be stuck
in a wall right now, Brad.

552
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,641
Yeah. I'm sorry to
say it, but he's right.

553
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:04,009
You almost killed the kids!

554
00:24:04,044 --> 00:24:05,745
Let's not beat up
on Brad here. Okay?

555
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:06,980
He was showboating
for the kids a little bit,

556
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:08,180
and things got out of hand.

557
00:24:08,214 --> 00:24:10,382
Let's all just be grateful
nobody got hurt. Okay?

558
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:11,817
I got hurt!

559
00:24:11,852 --> 00:24:13,820
Okay, kids, listen up.
This is a good lesson

560
00:24:13,854 --> 00:24:16,456
on why you never wanna lie
about your ability to do things

561
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:18,924
you clearly can't do,
okay?

562
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,927
I think my arm is
stuck in the wall.

563
00:24:20,961 --> 00:24:22,496
Brad, just stay still.
I'll get you out.

564
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,564
No, no, no, no, no.
No, don't do anything.

565
00:24:24,597 --> 00:24:26,699
And would you please
just go and get a shirt on?

566
00:24:26,732 --> 00:24:28,201
Just calm down, all right?

567
00:24:34,207 --> 00:24:36,709
Hey, I'm really sorry about
what happened to your car.

568
00:24:36,742 --> 00:24:38,544
Yeah, and I'm sorry about
what happened to your bike.

569
00:24:38,578 --> 00:24:40,846
No damage.
Not a scratch.

570
00:24:40,881 --> 00:24:43,083
Not even one scratch?

571
00:24:43,084 --> 00:24:43,650
Unbelievable.

572
00:24:43,685 --> 00:24:44,218
That's so good.

573
00:24:51,023 --> 00:24:52,992
Let's keep it going!
Inside the cones!

574
00:24:53,026 --> 00:24:54,494
Just like ice cream!

575
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,929
Morning, Jerry.

576
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:58,163
Got to keep it
inside the cones!

577
00:24:58,198 --> 00:25:00,800
No, Daddy! You're supposed
to stay in the cones!

578
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:03,603
Whoa, whoa!
Inside the cones!

579
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:05,270
Inside. Bring her in.
That's better.

580
00:25:05,305 --> 00:25:07,841
Let's keep those kids safe
today, okay? Thank you, Brad.

581
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:08,976
Sorry, Doris.

582
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,980
It's okay. This whole
drop-off line thing

583
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,548
can be a bit overwhelming
if you're not used to it.

584
00:25:15,582 --> 00:25:17,617
Yeah, well, I've landed a chopper
in the middle of a Cuban prison riot,

585
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:19,384
Brad, I think I'm good.

586
00:25:21,054 --> 00:25:24,557
Bye, guys! I love you guys so
much. Have a great day, okay?

587
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,192
Make sure you do
all your work.

588
00:25:26,226 --> 00:25:27,227
Bye, guys. Have the best day.
I love you so...

589
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,464
Here's
the exciting thing.

590
00:25:32,499 --> 00:25:34,500
We just opened up
in our 68th market,

591
00:25:34,534 --> 00:25:36,603
making The Panda America's

592
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:38,538
number three
smooth jazz station.

593
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:39,972
Wow.

594
00:25:41,073 --> 00:25:44,111
And here it is.
My... My little nook.

595
00:25:45,344 --> 00:25:48,849
Wow. Man, I gotta admit,
this is more than I expected.

596
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,250
Wow.

597
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:52,985
I kind of envy you, Brad.

598
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:54,587
Stop it.

599
00:25:54,621 --> 00:25:56,522
It's true. I mean,
you're a nice guy,

600
00:25:56,556 --> 00:25:58,223
making a comfortable
living,

601
00:25:58,257 --> 00:26:00,460
and the most fantastic woman
in the world loves you dearly.

602
00:26:00,493 --> 00:26:02,260
Really? Thanks for
saying that.

603
00:26:02,295 --> 00:26:05,999
I mean it. And that sacrifice she's
making for you... That's true love.

604
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:07,500
Sacrifice?

605
00:26:07,534 --> 00:26:08,935
Well, sure, Brad.

606
00:26:08,969 --> 00:26:10,037
You know how bad that
girl wants another baby.

607
00:26:11,805 --> 00:26:13,471
She wants another baby?

608
00:26:13,506 --> 00:26:15,074
For her to let
that slip away

609
00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:17,644
and marry a man she knew to
be barren, that's true love.

610
00:26:18,845 --> 00:26:20,546
How do you know
that I can't...

611
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,115
-Bradley.
-Yes?

612
00:26:22,148 --> 00:26:24,016
Caroline says we're gonna hear
some new voice talent this a.m.?

613
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:26,153
Yes, sir, in about
15 minutes.

614
00:26:26,185 --> 00:26:29,923
Okay. How'd it go with
the shitbag ex-husband?

615
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:32,891
You whip his ass with
that Loving Fence of yours?

616
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:35,160
Well, actually,
it's interesting, Mr. Holt,

617
00:26:35,194 --> 00:26:38,263
because I want you
to meet Dusty Mayron.

618
00:26:38,297 --> 00:26:41,802
Jesus in the morning.
She was married to him first?

619
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:45,171
Okay. Let's establish some
ground rules, pretty boy.

620
00:26:45,204 --> 00:26:46,673
Airborne?

621
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:49,074
Well, your lapel pin. 101st,
that's one hell of a division, sir.

622
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:51,644
Well,
thank you, Dusty.

623
00:26:51,678 --> 00:26:53,012
Are you Airborne?

624
00:26:53,046 --> 00:26:55,014
No, sir, I'm afraid
I don't share that honor,

625
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:57,048
but I'm humbled to be in the
presence of anyone who does.

626
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:59,319
Airborne Division?
Those guys love to fly.

627
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,053
Very nice to meet you, sir.

628
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:03,956
Thank you, thank you.
It's good to meet you.

629
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,191
My pleasure.
It's an honor.

630
00:27:05,223 --> 00:27:06,792
Fast friends over there.

631
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,194
That's wonderful.

632
00:27:09,228 --> 00:27:11,031
Come on! No way!

633
00:27:11,064 --> 00:27:12,999
The whole time you're running
guns for the freedom fighters

634
00:27:13,032 --> 00:27:14,900
right under
the cartel's noses,

635
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:17,069
and they never suspected
it was you once?

636
00:27:17,104 --> 00:27:19,472
Well, I'm sure they started to suspect
once they were in a ball of fire

637
00:27:19,506 --> 00:27:20,940
the size of
four city blocks.

638
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:24,576
That's great.
I love that!

639
00:27:24,611 --> 00:27:26,345
Holy buckets, Brad!

640
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:28,647
If this guy was my wife's ex,
I'd put a bullet in my skull.

641
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:31,584
Come on, Leo,
cut it out.

642
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:34,086
Sir,
I think Barry's ready.

643
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,454
You're really going
to like this guy.

644
00:27:35,489 --> 00:27:37,423
Okay. Ready to listen.

645
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:49,403
All right.

646
00:27:51,104 --> 00:27:53,139
-You like him, Brad?
-I do.

647
00:27:53,173 --> 00:27:57,710
I do. I mean, I think his
voice has a warm dependability

648
00:27:57,743 --> 00:28:00,012
that all Panda listeners
could trust.

649
00:28:00,814 --> 00:28:01,782
What do you think, Duster?

650
00:28:03,215 --> 00:28:05,151
Does Dusty now
work for The Panda?

651
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:07,220
Yeah, Brad's right.

652
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:09,254
I'm not really into smooth
jazz. I shouldn't comment.

653
00:28:09,288 --> 00:28:11,458
Nobody's
into smooth jazz.

654
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,826
I'm into smooth jazz.

655
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:13,826
Of course you are, Brad.

656
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,095
So what do you
think, Dusty?

657
00:28:16,128 --> 00:28:17,830
I mean, it just seems
a little flaccid.

658
00:28:17,864 --> 00:28:19,132
You know, I think you
need a voice with

659
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:21,166
some virility and hope,
that tells listeners,

660
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,437
"Hey! Maybe the next song won't
suck as bad as the last one."

661
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:26,439
Also, I think a strong
ability to be something like...

662
00:28:35,048 --> 00:28:35,915
What...

663
00:28:36,516 --> 00:28:38,317
What just happened?

664
00:28:39,553 --> 00:28:42,155
He sang the tagline.

665
00:28:42,188 --> 00:28:43,490
Good boy, Tumor!

666
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:45,991
Daddy!

667
00:28:46,026 --> 00:28:46,927
Hey!

668
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:49,861
Perfect timing.
Listen to this.

669
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:55,134
Is that you?

670
00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:56,168
That's you?

671
00:28:57,269 --> 00:28:59,204
Why is that him?

672
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:01,207
I took him to work,
and 15 minutes later

673
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,709
he's the new voice
of The Panda.

674
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,644
Hey, you believe that? I record
one take at 9:30 this morning,

675
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:07,280
it's already run 11 times.

676
00:29:07,313 --> 00:29:09,315
Do I really get 182 bucks
every time they play that?

677
00:29:09,348 --> 00:29:10,482
Yes. Every time, yes.

678
00:29:10,517 --> 00:29:12,152
Money.

679
00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:14,253
You see why I love America
even more than most people do?

680
00:29:14,688 --> 00:29:16,389
Hey. What's this?

681
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:17,958
Just the handyman
I hired off Angie's List.

682
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,625
He's upstairs
fixing the damage.

683
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,595
Your wife had to
hire a man? For what?

684
00:29:22,629 --> 00:29:23,963
Some framing,
a little sheetrock repair,

685
00:29:23,997 --> 00:29:25,565
some masonry and basic
window glazing?

686
00:29:25,598 --> 00:29:26,933
Come on, Brad. We can
bang that out tonight.

687
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:30,671
Yeah.

688
00:29:30,703 --> 00:29:32,805
It's just basic
sheetrock glazing

689
00:29:32,838 --> 00:29:35,208
and, you know,
little whatamajigs.

690
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:37,210
Get up there and

691
00:29:38,678 --> 00:29:40,813
get in there and
crank it out.

692
00:29:40,846 --> 00:29:42,014
Dusty is pretty good
with his hands.

693
00:29:42,048 --> 00:29:43,517
Pretty good with my hands,
Brad, she knows.

694
00:29:45,552 --> 00:29:47,887
Okay. Yeah, I'll just
go up there and I'll...

695
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,622
Want me to do it?
I'll tell him to screw.

696
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:50,990
No, no, no. That's okay.

697
00:29:51,024 --> 00:29:52,359
I'll tell him...

698
00:29:52,392 --> 00:29:53,793
Tell him the men are here.

699
00:29:53,826 --> 00:29:55,027
I'll say that.
I'll say, "The men are here."

700
00:29:55,061 --> 00:29:56,796
I don't want to
imply to him

701
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:58,965
that he's not a man.
But I'll just say,

702
00:29:58,998 --> 00:30:00,834
"Hey, the boys are
back in town." Right?

703
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:07,540
Hi.

704
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:11,510
I'm Brad...
My wife hired you.

705
00:30:11,544 --> 00:30:12,879
Nice to meet you, Brad.

706
00:30:12,912 --> 00:30:15,982
I just came up here
to say that you...

707
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:20,254
That, you should
have good luck.

708
00:30:21,421 --> 00:30:23,256
Thank you for
your wishes of luck.

709
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:24,190
I'll be downstairs.

710
00:30:26,293 --> 00:30:28,128
Well? What happened?

711
00:30:28,161 --> 00:30:29,863
You know,
I think it's...

712
00:30:29,895 --> 00:30:33,232
He already started, and I
just think it feels wrong.

713
00:30:33,266 --> 00:30:34,400
Why? Because he's black?

714
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:35,701
No. No, no.

715
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:37,703
Megan! Dylan!

716
00:30:37,738 --> 00:30:38,372
What are you doing?

717
00:30:38,407 --> 00:30:39,006
Teaching moment.

718
00:30:40,373 --> 00:30:43,509
Guys, what would we call Brad
if he treated someone differently

719
00:30:43,543 --> 00:30:45,378
just because of the color
of their skin?

720
00:30:45,411 --> 00:30:48,680
-Brad's being racism?
-Racist, honey.

721
00:30:48,715 --> 00:30:50,016
Brad is a racist.

722
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:51,651
No, I mean...
But not on purpose.

723
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:55,622
-Is Brad a Klan person?
-No.

724
00:30:55,654 --> 00:30:58,290
So I'm a racist if
I don't fire someone?

725
00:30:58,324 --> 00:30:59,325
Well, yeah, you are.

726
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:00,193
Yeah, you are.

727
00:31:02,696 --> 00:31:05,565
Sir, you're taking
this all wrong.

728
00:31:05,598 --> 00:31:07,233
Right. So you get one look
at the color of my skin,

729
00:31:07,267 --> 00:31:09,134
and all of a sudden you're
Mr. Do It Yourself?

730
00:31:09,168 --> 00:31:10,703
No, not at all.
Please,

731
00:31:10,736 --> 00:31:12,405
allow me to pay you
for your time and travel.

732
00:31:12,438 --> 00:31:14,841
Don't do me any favors,
Paula Deen.

733
00:31:16,442 --> 00:31:17,576
I'm not a woman.

734
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:19,212
You did the right thing.

735
00:31:19,245 --> 00:31:21,247
Boy, it doesn't
feel that way.

736
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:22,614
Let's get cracking. Where
do you keep your tools?

737
00:31:22,649 --> 00:31:24,685
I know where Brad keeps
his tools. In the credenza.

738
00:31:25,751 --> 00:31:26,985
You keep your tools

739
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:28,387
in the credenza, Brad?

740
00:31:28,421 --> 00:31:29,655
Just easier to get to.

741
00:31:29,689 --> 00:31:31,056
It's convenient.

742
00:31:31,057 --> 00:31:31,091
Yeah.

743
00:31:33,692 --> 00:31:35,295
This is a tackle box, Brad.
Are we going fishing?

744
00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:37,430
No. We're not gonna...
Unless you want to go fishing.

745
00:31:37,463 --> 00:31:39,732
What have you got in here?

746
00:31:39,766 --> 00:31:41,566
A hammer, masking tape,
three C batteries and...

747
00:31:41,601 --> 00:31:42,869
A tampon.

748
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:43,936
Yeah, well, a tampon's
handy for...

749
00:31:43,969 --> 00:31:45,372
Yeah, I know what
they're handy for.

750
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,908
So are we not
going to fix it?

751
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,209
Well, what do you
want from me, Brad?

752
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:50,709
To buy all the gear we need
would cost more

753
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,645
than just hiring someone
off of Angie's List.

754
00:31:59,485 --> 00:32:01,087
And the King,
he thought

755
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,823
the Step King seemed okay at
first, a little soft, maybe,

756
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:06,191
but, heck, the Queen
needed a meal ticket.

757
00:32:06,226 --> 00:32:08,027
But the more the King
learned about him,

758
00:32:08,061 --> 00:32:10,163
the more he doubted the
Step King's ability to lead.

759
00:32:10,196 --> 00:32:12,732
So the King decided
there was only one way to...

760
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:14,234
Psst...
Hey. Good story?

761
00:32:14,267 --> 00:32:16,803
Yeah. The King finally
came back to his castle.

762
00:32:16,836 --> 00:32:19,940
But the evil Step King wouldn't
give him his crown back.

763
00:32:19,972 --> 00:32:23,209
Okay, yeah. I think I've
heard this story before.

764
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:25,210
It's a story
as old as time, Brad.

765
00:32:25,245 --> 00:32:27,781
Well, you know what? It turns out
the Step King wasn't evil at all.

766
00:32:27,814 --> 00:32:29,048
He was a really good guy.

767
00:32:29,082 --> 00:32:31,217
Fun at parties,
great conversationalist,

768
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:33,385
affable.
And he saw

769
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:36,354
that the beautiful Queen and
perfect Prince and Princess

770
00:32:36,389 --> 00:32:39,792
were all alone, and he came
valiantly to their rescue.

771
00:32:39,825 --> 00:32:41,893
Yeah, but wasn't
the Queen sad because

772
00:32:41,928 --> 00:32:44,031
the Step King couldn't give
her an heir to the throne?

773
00:32:44,064 --> 00:32:45,431
Okay, you know what?
Now this is getting personal.

774
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:48,035
Hey, Brad, come on. We're
just doing fairy tales here.

775
00:32:49,236 --> 00:32:51,004
All right. Well,
the Queen wasn't sad,

776
00:32:51,938 --> 00:32:54,073
just for the record.

777
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:56,675
The Step King was pretty sure
she was totally cool with it.

778
00:32:56,709 --> 00:32:58,879
Yeah, Brad's right. I'm sure
the Queen was thrilled. Right?

779
00:32:59,379 --> 00:33:00,414
Right?

780
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:02,148
Yeah.

781
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,921
Honey,

782
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:11,791
what's the matter?

783
00:33:12,892 --> 00:33:14,559
Are you still sad about
Dusty finding your tampon?

784
00:33:14,594 --> 00:33:16,697
No. No, I mean,

785
00:33:17,863 --> 00:33:19,632
this is a little
embarrassing,

786
00:33:19,665 --> 00:33:21,333
but it's just, I was...

787
00:33:23,469 --> 00:33:27,172
Is there any chance you
still want another baby?

788
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:30,109
My God. What, did
Dusty say something?

789
00:33:31,511 --> 00:33:33,547
He's just trying to
get in your head.

790
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,814
So it's not true then?

791
00:33:39,651 --> 00:33:41,988
Okay. Maybe I did
want another baby.

792
00:33:43,156 --> 00:33:45,291
But it's not possible,
given what happened to your...

793
00:33:45,324 --> 00:33:48,427
And I'm not blaming
them. I love them.

794
00:33:48,461 --> 00:33:49,962
They are my fuzzy
little pals.

795
00:33:49,995 --> 00:33:50,897
You don't have to
say that.

796
00:33:51,231 --> 00:33:52,132
They are.

797
00:33:53,099 --> 00:33:55,702
I am 100% happy with
the family that I have.

798
00:33:56,802 --> 00:33:58,204
The only reason
I'm putting up with him

799
00:33:58,236 --> 00:34:00,806
is because my kids
are so happy to see him.

800
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,376
And I want them to have a
relationship with their father.

801
00:34:04,311 --> 00:34:05,744
You know what?

802
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:07,346
I can't wait to
see his face

803
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,850
when he figures out how much
you really do for his kids.

804
00:34:10,616 --> 00:34:12,885
Yeah. I mean, I'm

805
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:16,555
involved.
I'm emotionally available.

806
00:34:16,589 --> 00:34:17,756
Yeah, you are.

807
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:20,192
You are darn right.

808
00:34:20,226 --> 00:34:23,429
It's high time Dusty sees
how a real dad does it.

809
00:34:24,063 --> 00:34:25,431
I am fired up!

810
00:34:27,467 --> 00:34:28,669
Let's get some shut-eye.

811
00:35:23,757 --> 00:35:24,825
Hallelujah!

812
00:35:34,467 --> 00:35:36,837
Hey, dudes! Hey, T.J.!

813
00:35:49,014 --> 00:35:50,817
Brad! Look what Dad did!

814
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:53,418
He finished
the treehouse for you!

815
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:54,987
Hey, hey! B-man!

816
00:35:57,456 --> 00:35:58,924
No, watch out, B!

817
00:36:00,827 --> 00:36:03,363
Hey, Brad. Sorry about that.
You all right?

818
00:36:03,396 --> 00:36:04,296
Brad, what do you
think, man?

819
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:06,066
Wow. Pretty cool zipline.

820
00:36:06,098 --> 00:36:07,966
You like that?
It's military grade.

821
00:36:08,001 --> 00:36:09,769
You built all this today?
With my tools?

822
00:36:09,803 --> 00:36:12,372
No, you can't build a
treehouse with a tampon, Brad.

823
00:36:12,405 --> 00:36:14,307
No, I had a little
bit of help.

824
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,475
Yo, Dylan,
PS4 is all hooked up.

825
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:17,326
Thanks, Uncle Griff.

826
00:36:17,361 --> 00:36:18,144
No problem, buddy.

827
00:36:18,178 --> 00:36:19,612
Uncle Griff?

828
00:36:19,646 --> 00:36:21,348
Dude, I went out for
a beer last night,

829
00:36:21,381 --> 00:36:23,016
and who's tending bar
but our man Griffy?

830
00:36:23,048 --> 00:36:25,284
We get to talking and we just
click. You know what I mean?

831
00:36:25,318 --> 00:36:27,252
He's a great dude, man.
He really is.

832
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:29,588
I know how you feel about him,
but just give him a chance.

833
00:36:29,622 --> 00:36:31,657
All right? He's having
a tough time at home,

834
00:36:31,691 --> 00:36:33,593
and your firing him
sure didn't help.

835
00:36:33,626 --> 00:36:35,060
Well, I fired him
because you made me!

836
00:36:35,095 --> 00:36:36,328
I made you?

837
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:38,598
Am I in charge around here
now? Is my name on the mortgage?

838
00:36:38,631 --> 00:36:39,999
Last time I checked,
you were the man of the house,

839
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,700
and me and Griffy
were just staying here.

840
00:36:41,734 --> 00:36:42,618
He's not staying here.

841
00:36:42,653 --> 00:36:43,502
Because he's black?

842
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:44,937
No, not because of that.

843
00:36:44,972 --> 00:36:47,140
Look, Griffy helped me
knock this out, all right?

844
00:36:47,173 --> 00:36:49,207
So despite any prejudices
that you may or may not have...

845
00:36:49,242 --> 00:36:52,144
-I don't have any prejudices.
-I said "may or may not."

846
00:36:52,178 --> 00:36:53,479
-Well, it's may not.
-Well, that's good.

847
00:36:53,513 --> 00:36:55,449
Because that's one
of the ones I said.

848
00:36:55,481 --> 00:36:56,815
Hey, kids, come on.
Helmets on the half-pipe.

849
00:36:56,848 --> 00:36:58,151
We got to be
safe around here.

850
00:36:58,185 --> 00:36:59,019
Wait, half-pipe?

851
00:37:01,622 --> 00:37:03,723
Look, I know it's taking up a lot
of the yard, but it's gonna make

852
00:37:03,756 --> 00:37:05,224
your house the coolest place
in the neighborhood.

853
00:37:05,258 --> 00:37:06,958
I got a sound system,
we got

854
00:37:06,993 --> 00:37:08,294
a couple Go-Pros. That's
Corey from Red Bull over there.

855
00:37:08,327 --> 00:37:10,095
Hey, Corey!

856
00:37:10,129 --> 00:37:11,364
You got a sponsor
for my backyard?

857
00:37:11,397 --> 00:37:13,767
Hey, Mr. Mayron!
You want next?

858
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,834
Nicholas, please,
it's Dusty!

859
00:37:15,868 --> 00:37:17,838
And, yes, I do.
Brad, watch this run.

860
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:22,408
I'm gonna dedicate this run
to my future X-Games champs,

861
00:37:22,441 --> 00:37:24,343
Dylan and Megan.
This is for you!

862
00:37:48,167 --> 00:37:50,803
Looks like you picked the
wrong leisure activity, buddy.

863
00:38:00,714 --> 00:38:02,015
Thank you.

864
00:38:02,615 --> 00:38:04,383
Hey, Sara.

865
00:38:04,417 --> 00:38:05,451
Okay. Who's got next?

866
00:38:05,484 --> 00:38:06,819
I do!

867
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:11,892
Look!

868
00:38:14,827 --> 00:38:16,696
Some cute little
tricks there, Dusty.

869
00:38:18,765 --> 00:38:19,766
Really adorable.

870
00:38:20,098 --> 00:38:21,568
Brad?

871
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,769
Hey, who'd like to see
how we used to do it

872
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:25,403
back in the empty pools
of Encino,

873
00:38:25,437 --> 00:38:27,073
Castaic, Irvine,
Long Beach?

874
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,041
Santa Clarita?

875
00:38:30,209 --> 00:38:31,345
Santa Cruz?

876
00:38:32,144 --> 00:38:33,579
Fremont?

877
00:38:33,613 --> 00:38:35,582
Honey, no,
please come down.

878
00:38:35,615 --> 00:38:37,917
I intend to, sister.

879
00:38:39,218 --> 00:38:41,453
Come on, Brad,
it hasn't been that long.

880
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:42,655
Godspeed.

881
00:38:45,225 --> 00:38:46,293
Whoa!

882
00:38:52,566 --> 00:38:54,567
My God! Brad!

883
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,169
No, it's best not to
touch him. Wait a second.

884
00:38:56,202 --> 00:38:57,771
What do you mean, don't
touch him? He's in trouble.

885
00:38:57,803 --> 00:38:59,571
Look, I know he's
in trouble, okay?

886
00:38:59,604 --> 00:39:01,106
But if there's a problem, who
do you want to be in charge?

887
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,442
You?

888
00:39:02,475 --> 00:39:04,544
Okay. All right, guys, we
have an emergency situation.

889
00:39:04,577 --> 00:39:06,345
And what's the first
thing we do? Anybody?

890
00:39:07,347 --> 00:39:08,314
You! Redhead.

891
00:39:08,349 --> 00:39:09,281
Call 911.

892
00:39:09,314 --> 00:39:12,484
Close. But wrong. First
thing we do is remain calm.

893
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:13,919
Yeah, that's good advice.

894
00:39:13,952 --> 00:39:16,322
The 911 operator can't understand
you if you're hysterical, okay?

895
00:39:16,356 --> 00:39:18,191
So let's all take a deep
breath. In for ten...

896
00:39:18,225 --> 00:39:20,527
Are you kidding me
right now? Help him!

897
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,462
Hey, that doesn't
sound calm, Sara.

898
00:39:22,495 --> 00:39:24,364
Now, please, call 911
and relate to the dispatcher

899
00:39:24,397 --> 00:39:26,332
what happened
calmly, okay?

900
00:39:26,365 --> 00:39:28,134
Anybody know
what we do next?

901
00:39:28,167 --> 00:39:29,568
Check for pulse!

902
00:39:29,602 --> 00:39:31,703
Nice! My star pupil!
Come on up here.

903
00:39:31,738 --> 00:39:33,772
All right! Okay,
two fingers on the neck,

904
00:39:33,805 --> 00:39:35,073
right below the ear.

905
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:37,676
Good. You feel
a heartbeat?

906
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:41,414
Okay, now that means that Brad
here is now clinically... Anybody?

907
00:39:41,446 --> 00:39:42,982
You, Jean Jacket!

908
00:39:43,015 --> 00:39:44,249
Attaboy, Jean Jacket.
You're a smart kid.

909
00:39:44,283 --> 00:39:45,452
He is dead.

910
00:39:45,484 --> 00:39:46,751
All right, so what do we do?

911
00:39:46,785 --> 00:39:48,120
Come on,
we're losing him here.

912
00:39:48,155 --> 00:39:50,022
Give him C.P.R.?

913
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:52,725
Yes! That's my girl.
Come on up here, sweetie.

914
00:39:52,758 --> 00:39:54,727
All right! All right,
lock your fingers like this

915
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,562
and press down
hard right here.

916
00:39:56,595 --> 00:39:58,097
Great job, sweetheart.

917
00:39:58,131 --> 00:39:59,332
Dusty, hurry!

918
00:39:59,365 --> 00:40:00,966
Okay, I'm going to go
ahead and take this one.

919
00:40:01,001 --> 00:40:02,636
Okay? Watch closely now.

920
00:40:02,669 --> 00:40:04,437
If you do your chest
compressions properly,

921
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:06,673
it shouldn't take long.
Clear out, guys.

922
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:12,310
I got him! I got him!

923
00:40:15,247 --> 00:40:17,617
My dad can bring people
back from the dead!

924
00:40:19,252 --> 00:40:21,287
Mr. Whitaker's a zombie!

925
00:40:25,091 --> 00:40:28,895
Look, I'm okay, really.
I just got a little jolt.

926
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:31,531
You got a little killed
is what you got, Brad.

927
00:40:31,564 --> 00:40:33,033
We thought we lost you.

928
00:40:33,499 --> 00:40:35,134
Okay, I'm sorry.

929
00:40:35,167 --> 00:40:37,169
I just got tired of being
the lame stepdad.

930
00:40:37,202 --> 00:40:39,138
All the kids think
he's Superman.

931
00:40:39,171 --> 00:40:41,206
Well, now you know
how I felt.

932
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,975
I always had to be
the bad guy mom,

933
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:45,844
giving out the carrots
and the punishments,

934
00:40:45,879 --> 00:40:48,414
and he would breeze in
from God only knows where

935
00:40:48,448 --> 00:40:50,383
and get to be
the cool, fun dad.

936
00:40:50,415 --> 00:40:52,118
Honey. Look.

937
00:40:52,685 --> 00:40:54,253
I'll talk to him, okay?

938
00:40:54,287 --> 00:40:55,722
I'll tell him to
get his stuff

939
00:40:55,754 --> 00:40:57,490
and get over to the
Red Roof Inn. Pronto.

940
00:40:58,158 --> 00:40:59,059
Great.

941
00:41:02,894 --> 00:41:06,064
Wait. Prince Hans is
actually the bad guy?

942
00:41:06,097 --> 00:41:07,766
Man, I didn't see
that coming at all.

943
00:41:07,801 --> 00:41:08,802
He seemed like he
really loved Anna.

944
00:41:09,468 --> 00:41:10,369
I hate Prince Hans.

945
00:41:10,403 --> 00:41:12,104
Dusty.

946
00:41:12,138 --> 00:41:13,507
Hey, how you
feeling, Sparky?

947
00:41:14,406 --> 00:41:16,175
Sparky. That's hilarious.

948
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:17,443
Brad, have you
seen this movie?

949
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:18,944
It's unbelievable, man.

950
00:41:18,979 --> 00:41:20,879
There's these two sisters,
one of them has ice powers.

951
00:41:20,912 --> 00:41:22,515
<i>Yeah, I'm familiar
with Frozen.</i>

952
00:41:23,848 --> 00:41:25,452
Listen, Dusty, I need
to talk to you now.

953
00:41:25,484 --> 00:41:26,618
I can't talk now, Brad.

954
00:41:26,653 --> 00:41:27,854
Just pause the movie!

955
00:41:27,888 --> 00:41:29,222
Can you guys
talk out there, please?

956
00:41:29,254 --> 00:41:30,722
Griff, man.
You gotta pause it, man.

957
00:41:30,756 --> 00:41:32,291
No! I don't want to
ruin the momentum.

958
00:41:32,325 --> 00:41:35,127
He won't... Dude, if another song
comes on, you got to pause it. Okay?

959
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,662
Am I supposed to
pause my emotions?

960
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:38,731
Just pause the song, man.

961
00:41:38,765 --> 00:41:40,600
What's up? What's up?
What's going on, Brad?

962
00:41:40,633 --> 00:41:42,301
This shouldn't take long.

963
00:41:42,334 --> 00:41:44,403
Listen, I just think
that you're being here...

964
00:41:44,437 --> 00:41:46,473
Yeah. No problem.

965
00:41:46,506 --> 00:41:47,941
and now there's
Griff here,

966
00:41:47,973 --> 00:41:49,374
it's presenting
some obstacles...

967
00:41:51,577 --> 00:41:53,011
Stupid helmet!

968
00:41:53,044 --> 00:41:54,446
Honey, what happened?

969
00:41:54,481 --> 00:41:55,747
They pushed me
off my bike again!

970
00:41:55,781 --> 00:41:57,017
I'm so sick of it!

971
00:42:02,754 --> 00:42:03,988
I want them dead, Brad.
All right?

972
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:05,323
I want their parents dead.

973
00:42:05,357 --> 00:42:06,892
And if they don't
have parents, I want

974
00:42:06,926 --> 00:42:08,661
their primary caregivers dead.
Do you understand me?

975
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:09,377
Okay, okay.

976
00:42:09,412 --> 00:42:10,062
He's okay.

977
00:42:10,095 --> 00:42:12,664
Megan's upstairs playing with
him. I am so pissed about this.

978
00:42:12,698 --> 00:42:13,900
Was it the fourth
graders again?

979
00:42:13,934 --> 00:42:16,301
Fourth graders? What,
you knew about this, Brad?

980
00:42:16,334 --> 00:42:18,771
Yeah. Dylan asked to speak
specifically to me about it.

981
00:42:18,803 --> 00:42:20,138
So, we role-played

982
00:42:20,171 --> 00:42:21,774
some conflict
resolution dialogue.

983
00:42:21,807 --> 00:42:23,575
Are you being serious
right now, Brad?

984
00:42:23,609 --> 00:42:26,078
What you need to be teaching him
is some ass-beating resolution.

985
00:42:26,111 --> 00:42:29,182
Damn straight. You got to
make a statement. Set a tone.

986
00:42:29,214 --> 00:42:31,617
It's kind of
a family matter over here.

987
00:42:31,651 --> 00:42:33,219
No, Dusty and
Griff are right.

988
00:42:33,252 --> 00:42:34,921
Those little punks need
their butts whooped.

989
00:42:34,953 --> 00:42:36,289
Hey, you got any
Miracle Whip?

990
00:42:36,321 --> 00:42:37,823
Yeah, it's behind the...

991
00:42:37,856 --> 00:42:39,925
Here. Hold on.
Let me just get it for you.

992
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:43,530
Guys, I know
we're upset right now,

993
00:42:44,097 --> 00:42:45,598
but here's the thing.

994
00:42:46,566 --> 00:42:48,267
Violence never
solved anything.

995
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,468
Hey, check your
history books, buddy.

996
00:42:49,502 --> 00:42:50,704
Almost everything is
solved by violence.

997
00:42:50,736 --> 00:42:52,203
There are better ways.

998
00:42:52,238 --> 00:42:54,874
Okay. Name one.
Besides dialoguing.

999
00:42:54,908 --> 00:42:55,959
Name one?

1000
00:42:55,994 --> 00:42:57,010
Name one!

1001
00:42:57,042 --> 00:42:58,877
What do you mean,
name one?

1002
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:00,113
solve problems with things
other than fighting.

1003
00:43:00,146 --> 00:43:01,379
-What are you gonna do?
-I don't know.

1004
00:43:01,414 --> 00:43:03,616
Well, you said you knew!
You act like you knew!

1005
00:43:03,649 --> 00:43:04,651
Fine, yes!

1006
00:43:04,684 --> 00:43:06,218
Dancing! Dancing.

1007
00:43:09,221 --> 00:43:11,757
Did you... Did you just
say dancing, Brad?

1008
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:15,694
It's very popular in youth culture
to resolve conflict through dancing.

1009
00:43:15,728 --> 00:43:18,031
They step up to each other
and get served

1010
00:43:18,063 --> 00:43:20,567
by crunking,
or popping and locking.

1011
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,002
They call each other out,
they take turns,

1012
00:43:23,036 --> 00:43:26,906
and it is no less intense
than a classic street brawl.

1013
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:30,176
But, at the end of the day,
no one's hurt.

1014
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:33,146
And it's a great
aerobic workout.

1015
00:43:33,179 --> 00:43:36,115
He's flailing a bit,
but he has a good point.

1016
00:43:36,148 --> 00:43:38,851
There's a rich history
of dance battles in film.

1017
00:43:38,884 --> 00:43:40,652
I didn't even
think of this.

1018
00:43:40,686 --> 00:43:42,855
<i>Electric Boogaloo.</i>

1019
00:43:42,889 --> 00:43:44,557
One of the rare cases
where the sequel was better

1020
00:43:44,589 --> 00:43:45,958
than the original.

1021
00:43:45,991 --> 00:43:47,694
<i>You got Step Up,
Stomp the Yard.</i>

1022
00:43:47,726 --> 00:43:50,061
He makes a solid point.

1023
00:43:50,096 --> 00:43:52,465
Honey, are you telling us that
we should teach Dylan to dance?

1024
00:43:52,498 --> 00:43:55,034
No, I'm just saying

1025
00:43:55,067 --> 00:43:56,902
that teaching him to fight
isn't the answer.

1026
00:43:56,935 --> 00:43:59,939
Okay, but maybe teaching him
to fight back isn't so bad?

1027
00:44:02,074 --> 00:44:03,109
Okay.

1028
00:44:04,511 --> 00:44:08,081
There we go. Perfect.
That's good, right there.

1029
00:44:09,348 --> 00:44:10,783
Yeah. A lot of protection.

1030
00:44:15,922 --> 00:44:16,956
All right, Dylan.
You ready, buddy?

1031
00:44:16,989 --> 00:44:18,691
You're ready.

1032
00:44:18,725 --> 00:44:20,659
Brad, Griff. You guys
be the fourth graders.

1033
00:44:20,692 --> 00:44:22,156
-I'll be Dylan.
-Ok.

1034
00:44:22,328 --> 00:44:24,564
All right. Hey, buddy, the
first thing you want to do

1035
00:44:24,598 --> 00:44:26,500
is call out
the biggest one.

1036
00:44:26,533 --> 00:44:28,500
Hey! What's the matter?

1037
00:44:28,535 --> 00:44:29,736
You too much of
a pussy to take me on

1038
00:44:29,768 --> 00:44:30,971
without your little bitches
to back you up?

1039
00:44:31,971 --> 00:44:35,642
Wow. Okay, yes. That cut
right through me, there.

1040
00:44:35,674 --> 00:44:37,943
I'm filled with inner
shame right now.

1041
00:44:37,977 --> 00:44:40,214
Saying to myself,
"Gosh, maybe I'm not behaving

1042
00:44:40,247 --> 00:44:43,517
"100% the way I want to."
Right? Is that same page?

1043
00:44:43,549 --> 00:44:45,951
No. What the kid's gonna think
is, "Now I can beat your ass

1044
00:44:45,986 --> 00:44:48,721
"all on my own." But now you only
got one bully to contend with.

1045
00:44:48,754 --> 00:44:50,489
Now bullies always open up
with some shoving first.

1046
00:44:50,524 --> 00:44:52,058
Watch. Brad,
give me a little shove.

1047
00:44:52,059 --> 00:44:52,093
All right.

1048
00:44:53,393 --> 00:44:54,628
Whoa, I didn't connect
there, did I?

1049
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:56,863
No. It was really close,
though.

1050
00:44:56,897 --> 00:44:59,332
See what I did, buddy?
I turned my body just enough

1051
00:44:59,366 --> 00:45:00,433
to let his weight
bring him in,

1052
00:45:00,466 --> 00:45:01,767
then I came
right down Broadway.

1053
00:45:01,801 --> 00:45:03,469
I'm not gonna hit you.

1054
00:45:03,502 --> 00:45:05,939
Okay, relax. Okay?

1055
00:45:05,971 --> 00:45:07,207
Bam!

1056
00:45:07,241 --> 00:45:08,440
It's called the element
of surprise.

1057
00:45:08,475 --> 00:45:10,110
Then you start
punking his ass!

1058
00:45:10,143 --> 00:45:12,145
You want some more of that,
bitch? You like that, bitch?

1059
00:45:12,178 --> 00:45:13,879
All right. Do we really
need to use that word?

1060
00:45:13,913 --> 00:45:15,214
Honey, yes.

1061
00:45:15,247 --> 00:45:16,715
Unfortunately,
we do. I'm sorry.

1062
00:45:16,748 --> 00:45:18,884
You have to make
him a bitch.

1063
00:45:18,917 --> 00:45:20,653
It's a fundamental step in
destroying a bully's psyche.

1064
00:45:20,687 --> 00:45:22,322
Now stay down, bitch!

1065
00:45:22,355 --> 00:45:23,790
Then you kick that kid
right in the nuts!

1066
00:45:23,823 --> 00:45:24,891
Kick him in
the nuts, Dylan!

1067
00:45:24,924 --> 00:45:26,493
Wait! I thought you
were in my gang.

1068
00:45:26,526 --> 00:45:29,029
Yeah, but once Dylan tuned
you up, I switched sides.

1069
00:45:29,062 --> 00:45:30,797
What do you think happens out
there on the playground, Brad?

1070
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:32,398
All right, now come on, buddy.
It's your turn. All right?

1071
00:45:32,431 --> 00:45:33,832
I'll be the fourth grader.

1072
00:45:33,866 --> 00:45:36,002
Can I just go inside
already, please?

1073
00:45:36,035 --> 00:45:37,837
Hey, buddy come on, this
is easy. You can do this.

1074
00:45:37,870 --> 00:45:39,838
I said, no!
I don't like this stuff.

1075
00:45:39,872 --> 00:45:42,341
I'll just stay away from them
from now on. Mom?

1076
00:45:42,375 --> 00:45:43,609
Okay, come here, buddy.

1077
00:45:43,643 --> 00:45:44,878
Come on. It's all right.

1078
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:46,179
Help me out here.
Come on.

1079
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:48,948
Hey, wait.

1080
00:45:49,982 --> 00:45:52,251
Pal, listen...

1081
00:45:52,285 --> 00:45:54,152
I know what it's like
to be afraid to go to school.

1082
00:45:54,187 --> 00:45:56,221
Okay? When I was your age,

1083
00:45:56,256 --> 00:45:58,192
this group of older kids
started picking on me.

1084
00:45:59,692 --> 00:46:01,727
I ran and I cried
underneath the bleachers.

1085
00:46:01,761 --> 00:46:04,531
They bothered me every day,
because they knew

1086
00:46:05,431 --> 00:46:06,567
I was too afraid
to face them.

1087
00:46:07,466 --> 00:46:09,901
Until one day,
I'd had enough.

1088
00:46:09,935 --> 00:46:12,372
And I socked Jesse Hubbard
right in the nose.

1089
00:46:12,406 --> 00:46:14,041
Really? And they
left you alone?

1090
00:46:14,607 --> 00:46:15,809
Damn right they did.

1091
00:46:19,712 --> 00:46:22,282
Brad.
That was good.

1092
00:46:22,315 --> 00:46:25,951
Come here, buddy. Hey, I'm
proud of you. All right?

1093
00:46:25,986 --> 00:46:27,353
Now, look at me.
I want you to

1094
00:46:27,386 --> 00:46:28,654
punch them right
in the Adam's apple. Okay?

1095
00:46:28,687 --> 00:46:30,422
I want you to
shatter their throat.

1096
00:46:30,457 --> 00:46:31,825
Hold on, hold on.

1097
00:46:33,326 --> 00:46:36,997
I'm sorry. Look, I'm having
a pang of guilt right now.

1098
00:46:37,029 --> 00:46:38,832
Full disclosure.
Some of the elements

1099
00:46:38,864 --> 00:46:39,966
of my story weren't
exactly true.

1100
00:46:41,033 --> 00:46:43,502
The incessant crying,
100% true.

1101
00:46:43,536 --> 00:46:46,172
The constant bullying, absolutely,
it all happened, but I...

1102
00:46:47,506 --> 00:46:49,642
I've never punched
anyone in my life.

1103
00:46:49,674 --> 00:46:51,176
I could have
told you that.

1104
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:52,778
Then what did you do?

1105
00:46:52,813 --> 00:46:54,346
Yeah, what did you do?

1106
00:46:54,381 --> 00:46:56,315
Well, nothing at all. In
fact, sixth grade was so rough,

1107
00:46:56,350 --> 00:46:57,851
I changed my name to

1108
00:46:58,585 --> 00:47:00,019
Devin Lacecock.

1109
00:47:00,053 --> 00:47:02,154
Why the hell would
you tell him that?

1110
00:47:02,189 --> 00:47:04,223
I pretended to be blind
for an entire school year,

1111
00:47:04,256 --> 00:47:05,725
just to elicit empathy.

1112
00:47:06,393 --> 00:47:08,361
Which was great until

1113
00:47:08,395 --> 00:47:12,165
<i>they found me intently
watching an episode of MASH.</i>

1114
00:47:12,198 --> 00:47:13,833
In fact, it got so bad,
my parents had to refinance

1115
00:47:13,866 --> 00:47:15,834
our house to put me
in private school.

1116
00:47:15,868 --> 00:47:19,506
Let's just do that. Can I
go to private school, please?

1117
00:47:19,538 --> 00:47:21,241
No, Dylan, we can't do that.
Want to know why?

1118
00:47:22,575 --> 00:47:24,810
Because ever since that day,

1119
00:47:24,843 --> 00:47:27,279
I've always run away
from conflict.

1120
00:47:27,314 --> 00:47:32,252
In fact, if I had a dad like
Dusty when I was your age, maybe

1121
00:47:32,285 --> 00:47:34,555
he could have taught me
how to stand up for myself.

1122
00:47:35,288 --> 00:47:37,657
So, wait. You're saying,

1123
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:39,926
if I don't stick up
for myself now,

1124
00:47:39,959 --> 00:47:42,796
I'll grow up to be
a huge wussy like you?

1125
00:47:42,828 --> 00:47:47,533
Yes. That is the basic
gist of what I'm saying. Yes.

1126
00:47:47,567 --> 00:47:49,969
Okay. Then let's do this.

1127
00:47:50,002 --> 00:47:51,571
Come on, buddy,
you got this.

1128
00:47:51,603 --> 00:47:52,805
Give me something.
Come on.

1129
00:47:52,839 --> 00:47:54,641
Faster, harder,
meaner, stronger.

1130
00:47:54,674 --> 00:47:55,908
You're fast,
you're good.

1131
00:47:55,942 --> 00:47:57,644
You're a winner.
You're a champion.

1132
00:47:57,678 --> 00:47:58,911
They got to let you
off the leash, baby.

1133
00:47:58,944 --> 00:48:00,080
We got a little
pit bull here.

1134
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:04,450
That was really nice,
you guys. Good job.

1135
00:48:04,484 --> 00:48:06,652
It was really fun to watch
the two of you working together

1136
00:48:06,685 --> 00:48:08,854
like a couple of
great co-dads.

1137
00:48:09,221 --> 00:48:10,256
Yeah.

1138
00:48:11,123 --> 00:48:13,192
Co-dads. That's...

1139
00:48:14,127 --> 00:48:15,728
That's good stuff.

1140
00:48:15,761 --> 00:48:17,797
You know what? In that
same spirit of unity,

1141
00:48:18,998 --> 00:48:20,634
I want to show my gratitude
for your inviting me

1142
00:48:20,667 --> 00:48:22,435
to stay here and share
moments like these.

1143
00:48:22,468 --> 00:48:24,770
About that, Dusty. When I pulled
you over there, actually...

1144
00:48:24,803 --> 00:48:27,072
No, what you've done here
does not go unnoticed.

1145
00:48:27,107 --> 00:48:28,875
And I repay my debts.

1146
00:48:28,908 --> 00:48:30,809
Look, Sara, I know how much
you want another child.

1147
00:48:30,843 --> 00:48:32,544
I think I can help
put a baby in there for you.

1148
00:48:32,578 --> 00:48:34,346
What are you saying?

1149
00:48:34,379 --> 00:48:36,582
Dusty, please! You got a guy?

1150
00:48:36,616 --> 00:48:38,652
Yes, I got a guy.
A fertility doctor.

1151
00:48:38,685 --> 00:48:40,953
He's a buddy of mine. I trained
him for his first Ironman.

1152
00:48:40,986 --> 00:48:43,155
All right? Dr. Francisco
is the real deal.

1153
00:48:43,189 --> 00:48:44,206
Dr. Emilio Francisco?

1154
00:48:44,241 --> 00:48:45,223
You've heard of him?

1155
00:48:45,257 --> 00:48:47,058
My God, yeah.

1156
00:48:47,093 --> 00:48:48,861
<i>He's been on Dr. Oz
like 10 times.</i>

1157
00:48:48,893 --> 00:48:50,596
Yeah, he's one
of the top five

1158
00:48:50,631 --> 00:48:52,431
reproductive endocrinologists
in the country.

1159
00:48:52,464 --> 00:48:55,167
See? People wait years to get
an appointment with this guy.

1160
00:48:55,201 --> 00:48:56,703
Do you really think
he would see us?

1161
00:48:56,736 --> 00:48:57,754
Whoa, whoa, hold on.

1162
00:48:57,789 --> 00:48:58,772
I know he would.

1163
00:48:58,805 --> 00:49:01,707
If anybody can help you
have a baby, he can.

1164
00:49:01,741 --> 00:49:02,976
Mommy's going to
have a baby?

1165
00:49:03,009 --> 00:49:04,411
Cool! Can we name it Griff?

1166
00:49:04,444 --> 00:49:05,911
Thanks, D-man.

1167
00:49:05,944 --> 00:49:08,247
Look, you guys, I don't
know if this is a good idea.

1168
00:49:08,281 --> 00:49:09,716
What, you don't wanna name
your baby after a black person?

1169
00:49:09,748 --> 00:49:11,216
Is that it?

1170
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:12,486
You probably want to name it
something really white,

1171
00:49:12,518 --> 00:49:14,120
like Connor or Gordon.

1172
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:18,957
Harland, or Scot
with one T. Or Brad.

1173
00:49:18,991 --> 00:49:22,027
No, no, Griff is a lovely
name. I'm just saying,

1174
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:23,829
I don't think it's a good
idea to get our hopes up,

1175
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:27,065
because, in the end,

1176
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:30,437
odds are, I'm going
to let you down.

1177
00:49:30,469 --> 00:49:34,973
Okay, honey, but what if I promise,
promise, promise not to get my hopes up?

1178
00:49:35,007 --> 00:49:36,743
We could just try,
right? It can't hurt.

1179
00:49:38,243 --> 00:49:41,480
Okay, sure.
You can't get your hopes up.

1180
00:49:41,513 --> 00:49:42,781
No. I won't, I won't!
Thank you!

1181
00:49:42,815 --> 00:49:44,317
I feel like you've already
gotten your hopes up.

1182
00:49:45,852 --> 00:49:47,453
Where are you going?

1183
00:49:47,486 --> 00:49:49,288
You calling
your mother?

1184
00:49:49,321 --> 00:49:51,656
Okay, yes, but it's
about something else.

1185
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:52,826
It's not about
something else.

1186
00:49:53,459 --> 00:49:55,794
Damn it, Brad,
he set you up.

1187
00:49:55,828 --> 00:49:59,431
He used this fancy doctor to get
your wife back on the baby train.

1188
00:49:59,464 --> 00:50:03,635
When those test results come back and
prove that you can't give her a baby,

1189
00:50:03,669 --> 00:50:05,404
guess who's gonna be waiting
there cocked and loaded?

1190
00:50:05,939 --> 00:50:08,507
Well, I trust my wife,

1191
00:50:08,542 --> 00:50:10,843
so we really don't need to
keep talking about it, okay?

1192
00:50:10,875 --> 00:50:12,978
Let me tell you
a little story, Brad.

1193
00:50:13,011 --> 00:50:17,015
When Jeneane, my fourth, and I
were returning from our honeymoon,

1194
00:50:17,049 --> 00:50:19,252
she told me that she
had a 23-year-old kid.

1195
00:50:19,285 --> 00:50:22,355
Brazilian boy. Said
she had him real young.

1196
00:50:22,388 --> 00:50:23,823
So he moves in with us.

1197
00:50:23,857 --> 00:50:25,591
Doesn't speak
a lick of English.

1198
00:50:25,623 --> 00:50:29,062
There are the usual tensions.
I try to assert my authority.

1199
00:50:29,094 --> 00:50:31,964
"Andreas, get your
feet off the furniture."

1200
00:50:31,997 --> 00:50:35,034
"Andreas, you're too old
to sleep in bed with Mommy."

1201
00:50:35,067 --> 00:50:38,136
"Andreas, you got to
stay off the 'roids."

1202
00:50:38,169 --> 00:50:40,106
And he'd get mad, and
hit me with a car antenna.

1203
00:50:41,006 --> 00:50:42,674
Maybe that's
the way kids are.

1204
00:50:42,709 --> 00:50:44,477
No. Not really.

1205
00:50:44,511 --> 00:50:47,547
So I adopt him, help
him get his citizenship.

1206
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:50,349
The second the papers come
through, guess what happens?

1207
00:50:50,382 --> 00:50:51,451
I already know.

1208
00:50:51,484 --> 00:50:53,853
Bam! They shack up
together in Barstow.

1209
00:50:53,886 --> 00:50:57,756
It turns out Andreas
is her boyfriend, Brad.

1210
00:50:57,790 --> 00:50:59,859
I did not see it coming.

1211
00:50:59,892 --> 00:51:03,930
I actually did, about one,
two words into your story.

1212
00:51:03,962 --> 00:51:05,798
The moral of
this fable is,

1213
00:51:05,832 --> 00:51:08,067
it's good to know
when you're beaten.

1214
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:10,669
You know I think
the world of you, Brad.

1215
00:51:10,703 --> 00:51:12,605
But if I'm being
completely honest,

1216
00:51:12,638 --> 00:51:14,039
even I'm rooting
for Dusty.

1217
00:51:14,806 --> 00:51:16,142
He's just so
damn likeable.

1218
00:51:17,176 --> 00:51:19,746
You know, it's getting
kind of late.

1219
00:51:19,779 --> 00:51:20,447
Shouldn't we just
get back to work?

1220
00:51:21,147 --> 00:51:23,516
Okay, you win.

1221
00:51:23,549 --> 00:51:26,986
So where are we on The Panda
Jam numbers for next summer?

1222
00:51:28,654 --> 00:51:30,524
London, you still on
the conference call?

1223
00:51:32,959 --> 00:51:35,261
<i>Dusty Mayron,
you crazy hijo de puta!</i>

1224
00:51:36,395 --> 00:51:38,465
Hey,
what's up, Doc?

1225
00:51:38,497 --> 00:51:41,099
You look great, man. You
still rocking those Ironmans?

1226
00:51:41,134 --> 00:51:43,169
Yeah, bro. I just
finished Brazil in 11:40.

1227
00:51:43,201 --> 00:51:44,035
That's unbelievable.

1228
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:44,870
Yeah. Well, come on.

1229
00:51:44,904 --> 00:51:46,406
Ain't nothing on you, man.

1230
00:51:46,439 --> 00:51:49,408
Hey, my first race, I'm
limping across the finish line

1231
00:51:49,442 --> 00:51:51,077
when this bastard laps me.

1232
00:51:51,111 --> 00:51:52,612
I mean, come on,
who wins an Ironman,

1233
00:51:52,645 --> 00:51:54,447
then decides to go around
again? Who does that?

1234
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,248
It sounds exhausting.

1235
00:51:56,281 --> 00:51:59,585
Hey, I'm Dr. Francisco.
You must be Sara.

1236
00:51:59,618 --> 00:52:01,019
Hi.

1237
00:52:01,053 --> 00:52:03,889
Dusty, you were not lying
about this one. Very nice.

1238
00:52:04,890 --> 00:52:06,024
And you weren't lying
about this one either.

1239
00:52:06,058 --> 00:52:07,326
You must be Chief
Glowing Sack.

1240
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:09,260
What?

1241
00:52:09,294 --> 00:52:10,629
Hey, come on,
I'm just lighting you up, man.

1242
00:52:10,663 --> 00:52:11,964
Come on, little hug.

1243
00:52:11,997 --> 00:52:14,400
Okay, come on back, y'all.
Let's take a look.

1244
00:52:15,768 --> 00:52:17,002
All right.
So let's run it down.

1245
00:52:17,669 --> 00:52:19,271
I think we can safely say

1246
00:52:19,305 --> 00:52:21,341
that your issue has
nothing to do with X-rays.

1247
00:52:21,373 --> 00:52:22,808
You know what,
sweetheart, come here.

1248
00:52:22,841 --> 00:52:24,009
Let's see that
pretty little hand.

1249
00:52:24,042 --> 00:52:25,944
Okay. Now put it
right in here.

1250
00:52:25,978 --> 00:52:28,379
Okay, you feel that?

1251
00:52:28,413 --> 00:52:30,116
Okay, that is
not how you want

1252
00:52:30,149 --> 00:52:31,851
testicles to be shaped.

1253
00:52:31,884 --> 00:52:34,587
Really? It feels like
all the other...

1254
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:36,221
Hi.

1255
00:52:36,254 --> 00:52:38,557
Well, it cuts off blood
flow, okay? Limits potency.

1256
00:52:38,591 --> 00:52:40,460
You want them to...
You know what? Actually...

1257
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:43,630
Hey, Dusty!

1258
00:52:43,663 --> 00:52:44,897
Why is he coming in here?

1259
00:52:44,932 --> 00:52:46,132
Little help in here, please.

1260
00:52:46,165 --> 00:52:47,667
Come on. You gotta put me
through this every time?

1261
00:52:47,701 --> 00:52:49,502
Come on. Be a sport.

1262
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:50,636
My God!
What are you doing?

1263
00:52:50,669 --> 00:52:52,671
Is this even ethical?

1264
00:52:52,705 --> 00:52:54,607
James and
the Giant Peach.

1265
00:52:56,442 --> 00:52:58,776
Did you just gulp?

1266
00:52:58,810 --> 00:53:00,845
It's okay,
I gulp every time.

1267
00:53:00,879 --> 00:53:04,084
You see, this...
This is what you want.

1268
00:53:04,549 --> 00:53:05,919
Plump and bulbous.

1269
00:53:06,453 --> 00:53:08,554
Glassy smooth, like

1270
00:53:08,587 --> 00:53:11,323
two Patrick Stewarts,
you know what I mean?

1271
00:53:11,357 --> 00:53:12,959
Don't embarrass me in front of
Sara like this anymore, okay?

1272
00:53:12,991 --> 00:53:14,794
Hey, sorry, bro.

1273
00:53:14,826 --> 00:53:17,397
So, ready to milk the cow, see if
we even got a sliver of hope here?

1274
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:19,565
Hey, Dusty, come on, buddy. Want
to try to break your own record?

1275
00:53:19,598 --> 00:53:21,066
No, I'm good.

1276
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:22,634
Hey, come on, man.
I'm doing you a favor here.

1277
00:53:22,669 --> 00:53:25,437
Give me something to brag
about at the next symposium.

1278
00:53:25,471 --> 00:53:28,107
All right, fine. You want to break
the record, I gotta break the record.

1279
00:53:28,908 --> 00:53:31,277
Yeah.
Kid came to play.

1280
00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:32,678
Should I grab
a big cup, too?

1281
00:53:32,712 --> 00:53:33,980
What?
Stop screwing around.

1282
00:53:34,013 --> 00:53:35,215
Come on.
We're burning daylight here.

1283
00:54:04,743 --> 00:54:08,546
Hello. Quick question.
How difficult would it be

1284
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:11,750
for someone to whip up
a batch of your Cinnabons?

1285
00:54:11,783 --> 00:54:13,852
Would you need
restaurant-grade ovens?

1286
00:54:13,886 --> 00:54:15,821
Bradsky. Could you
pass this along to Dusty?

1287
00:54:15,855 --> 00:54:17,256
It's his first resids check.

1288
00:54:17,288 --> 00:54:19,292
Disclaimer.
It's more than you make.

1289
00:54:19,325 --> 00:54:20,993
Don't get worried about it.

1290
00:54:21,026 --> 00:54:24,364
And tell him,
8:30 sharp at my house.

1291
00:54:24,397 --> 00:54:26,032
He doesn't need to bring
anything. All right, buddy?

1292
00:54:26,064 --> 00:54:27,432
I've never been
to your house.

1293
00:54:27,466 --> 00:54:28,634
No, you haven't.

1294
00:54:32,305 --> 00:54:35,975
My God,
my hair, it looks awful.

1295
00:54:36,007 --> 00:54:37,343
Doesn't Mommy's
hair look pretty?

1296
00:54:37,377 --> 00:54:39,344
-No. Next slide, please.
-Okay.

1297
00:54:39,379 --> 00:54:42,381
Slides. Fun.

1298
00:54:42,415 --> 00:54:44,483
Cool. You guys
climbed that?

1299
00:54:44,517 --> 00:54:47,285
Yuck. Why are you guys kissing
in every single picture?

1300
00:54:47,319 --> 00:54:49,455
Mommy used to
kiss Daddy a lot.

1301
00:54:49,489 --> 00:54:51,023
Married people
kiss a lot.

1302
00:54:51,056 --> 00:54:52,390
Ready?

1303
00:54:52,424 --> 00:54:53,926
Wow, China.

1304
00:54:53,959 --> 00:54:55,861
I loved it there.

1305
00:54:55,895 --> 00:54:58,131
Dylan, you were created right
there on that wall, buddy.

1306
00:54:58,163 --> 00:55:00,031
Dusty, that's enough.

1307
00:55:00,065 --> 00:55:02,334
Okay, next slide.

1308
00:55:02,368 --> 00:55:03,969
That's where your
mom and I met,

1309
00:55:04,002 --> 00:55:06,104
<i>doing The King and I
in summer stock.</i>

1310
00:55:06,138 --> 00:55:08,408
God, that costume
was so tight.

1311
00:55:09,042 --> 00:55:10,677
Next slide, please.

1312
00:55:11,377 --> 00:55:12,478
My God.

1313
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:16,349
Is that baby me?

1314
00:55:28,694 --> 00:55:32,699
All right, you guys, let's,
get ready for bed.

1315
00:55:32,732 --> 00:55:34,734
It's story time,
Mayron family!

1316
00:55:36,134 --> 00:55:38,705
We don't have to wait
for Mr. Whitaker, do we?

1317
00:55:38,738 --> 00:55:42,509
I really don't like you, but
that shit is heartbreaking.

1318
00:55:48,114 --> 00:55:50,783
Yay! Griff's home!

1319
00:55:50,815 --> 00:55:54,187
So the King raised his mighty sword and
rained steel down upon the Step King.

1320
00:55:55,388 --> 00:55:56,656
But the Step King
blocked it with his shield.

1321
00:55:57,957 --> 00:56:00,926
And swung his cat o'nine tails
into the King's smug face.

1322
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,629
Which the King easily brushed
aside like the feather of a gull.

1323
00:56:03,663 --> 00:56:06,198
And then the King did counter
with a barrage of slashes

1324
00:56:06,232 --> 00:56:07,900
and thrusts
so fast and precise

1325
00:56:07,933 --> 00:56:09,535
that the Step King
had no way to parry.

1326
00:56:09,569 --> 00:56:10,703
Yay!

1327
00:56:10,736 --> 00:56:13,238
But he did. He did.
He parried all of them.

1328
00:56:13,272 --> 00:56:15,808
Easily. It was no big deal.

1329
00:56:15,841 --> 00:56:18,243
Then he grabbed the King's
sword right out of his hand

1330
00:56:19,044 --> 00:56:20,745
and smashed it
over his knee.

1331
00:56:20,779 --> 00:56:22,281
Boo!

1332
00:56:22,314 --> 00:56:24,583
That's when the King pulled out
a pump-action Mossberg shotgun!

1333
00:56:24,616 --> 00:56:26,919
Which is completely
anachronistic.

1334
00:56:26,953 --> 00:56:28,454
So if we're doing
any time period,

1335
00:56:28,488 --> 00:56:30,154
then the Step King
just happened to be

1336
00:56:30,189 --> 00:56:32,292
wearing Kevlar body armor.

1337
00:56:32,325 --> 00:56:34,259
Concussion grenade!

1338
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:34,976
Hand grenade.

1339
00:56:35,011 --> 00:56:35,352
Rocket launcher.

1340
00:56:35,387 --> 00:56:35,694
Missile launcher.

1341
00:56:35,727 --> 00:56:36,310
Air strike.

1342
00:56:36,345 --> 00:56:36,894
Nuclear strike.

1343
00:56:36,928 --> 00:56:38,830
Black hole.

1344
00:56:38,864 --> 00:56:40,265
We know what this
comes down to.

1345
00:56:40,299 --> 00:56:43,102
The Step King
was very upset

1346
00:56:43,136 --> 00:56:45,038
because when the real King
pulled out his sword,

1347
00:56:45,071 --> 00:56:47,239
it was long and shiny,

1348
00:56:47,272 --> 00:56:49,575
and the Step King did
shudder at the size of it.

1349
00:56:49,609 --> 00:56:53,045
And while the Step King acknowledged
that the King carried a mighty,

1350
00:56:53,078 --> 00:56:54,946
beautifully engraved
broadsword,

1351
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:57,183
all the maidens
in the land

1352
00:56:57,216 --> 00:56:59,718
preferred the more
average-sized

1353
00:56:59,752 --> 00:57:01,754
Step King's sword because

1354
00:57:01,786 --> 00:57:03,489
it knew how to listen.

1355
00:57:03,522 --> 00:57:06,992
And the King needs to realize
he's a guest in his castle

1356
00:57:07,026 --> 00:57:09,161
and he better mind
his P's and Q's

1357
00:57:09,194 --> 00:57:11,062
because the Step King
has had it up to here

1358
00:57:11,096 --> 00:57:12,799
with the King's bullshit!

1359
00:57:12,832 --> 00:57:14,366
Brad said a naughty word.

1360
00:57:14,399 --> 00:57:18,036
Kids, I'm so sorry you had to
hear that inappropriate language.

1361
00:57:18,069 --> 00:57:19,272
Make sure you
tell your mother.

1362
00:57:19,305 --> 00:57:20,607
Brad, can I talk to you
in the hall, please?

1363
00:57:23,341 --> 00:57:26,678
Brad, what just
happened in there, man?

1364
00:57:26,712 --> 00:57:30,483
Look, the Step King should not
have used inappropriate language

1365
00:57:30,515 --> 00:57:32,617
in front of the Prince and
Princess, he admits that.

1366
00:57:32,651 --> 00:57:33,386
Why are you still saying
it like that, Brad?

1367
00:57:33,419 --> 00:57:34,719
We're out in the hall.

1368
00:57:34,752 --> 00:57:37,055
I don't know. I'm upset.

1369
00:57:37,089 --> 00:57:38,190
Hold on.

1370
00:57:38,890 --> 00:57:40,492
Ho-ho! Hello?

1371
00:57:40,526 --> 00:57:42,761
Yeah, Brad's here,
he's doing good.

1372
00:57:42,794 --> 00:57:44,195
Hey, it's Dr. Francisco.

1373
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:45,531
He wants us all to come in
tomorrow. 9:30 work for you?

1374
00:57:45,564 --> 00:57:46,898
-Yeah, I guess so.
-Yeah, we'll see you then.

1375
00:57:46,933 --> 00:57:48,735
All right, bud.
Come on, man.

1376
00:57:49,667 --> 00:57:51,603
The doctor will be
with you in a moment.

1377
00:57:51,638 --> 00:57:52,739
Thank you.

1378
00:57:57,810 --> 00:57:58,710
Hey, Brad,

1379
00:58:00,046 --> 00:58:01,547
whatever happens here,
I just want you to know

1380
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:03,247
that I'm proud of you
for doing your best.

1381
00:58:03,281 --> 00:58:04,850
Thank you.

1382
00:58:04,884 --> 00:58:08,554
Hello, hello. Okay. I'm going
to cut right to the chase.

1383
00:58:08,587 --> 00:58:11,489
Sara, I'm afraid
I've got some bad news.

1384
00:58:11,522 --> 00:58:13,758
God. That is
a tough break. I'm sorry.

1385
00:58:13,792 --> 00:58:16,128
Damn, that is a real shame.
My heart is melting.

1386
00:58:16,161 --> 00:58:17,830
Yeah, it's a real
shame, Sara.

1387
00:58:17,863 --> 00:58:19,431
A real shame that
you're gonna have to put up

1388
00:58:19,464 --> 00:58:21,200
with Brad here
pounding away on you

1389
00:58:21,234 --> 00:58:24,002
over and over, now that
he's got a fighting chance

1390
00:58:24,035 --> 00:58:25,804
of getting you pregnant.

1391
00:58:25,837 --> 00:58:28,006
What?
My God!

1392
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:28,957
Holy moly!

1393
00:58:28,992 --> 00:58:29,875
My God.

1394
00:58:30,975 --> 00:58:33,578
Hey, Doc, Doc, don't give them
a false sense of hope.

1395
00:58:33,611 --> 00:58:36,581
Remember what you said about the
blood flow and the screwy 'nads?

1396
00:58:36,616 --> 00:58:38,684
Yeah, well, Brad has you
to thank for that, Dusty.

1397
00:58:38,716 --> 00:58:41,286
Okay, in lab rats,
whenever another alpha male

1398
00:58:41,319 --> 00:58:43,022
comes around,
it can spike testosterone,

1399
00:58:43,055 --> 00:58:44,589
driving up sperm counts.

1400
00:58:44,623 --> 00:58:47,326
Now, no guarantees, okay?
But with my help, Brad,

1401
00:58:47,359 --> 00:58:49,962
I think you got enough left in the tank
to make it all the way to baby town.

1402
00:58:49,995 --> 00:58:51,297
That's so wonderful.
Thank you.

1403
00:58:51,330 --> 00:58:53,833
Thank you so much.

1404
00:58:53,866 --> 00:58:55,535
Can we give you a hug?

1405
00:58:55,536 --> 00:58:55,570
Yeah. Come on in.

1406
00:58:56,736 --> 00:58:58,004
My gosh.

1407
00:58:59,004 --> 00:59:00,573
Did not expect this.

1408
00:59:16,055 --> 00:59:18,457
You virile sea snake, you.

1409
00:59:18,489 --> 00:59:20,585
-I underestimated you, Brad.
-Yes, you did.

1410
00:59:20,593 --> 00:59:21,346
This is what you need to do.

1411
00:59:21,361 --> 00:59:24,530
You need to go and pee outside
the room that Dusty sleeps in.

1412
00:59:24,564 --> 00:59:26,966
He's gonna smell your
urine and know that

1413
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,136
your virility is not
to be taken lightly.

1414
00:59:30,570 --> 00:59:32,706
It's good advice. I did
it last year in the lobby.

1415
00:59:32,739 --> 00:59:34,941
I remember.
It was a health hazard.

1416
00:59:34,974 --> 00:59:36,342
It scared the FedEx guy.

1417
00:59:36,376 --> 00:59:38,512
No, I'm going to take
the high road on this one.

1418
00:59:38,545 --> 00:59:40,413
Okay, fine,
take the high road.

1419
00:59:40,447 --> 00:59:43,216
But jam a baby up in there
as quickly as you can, Brad.

1420
00:59:43,251 --> 00:59:45,753
Because, in the end, if Sara
does choose Dusty over you,

1421
00:59:45,786 --> 00:59:48,488
he has to be stepdad
to your baby.

1422
00:59:48,521 --> 00:59:49,822
How beautiful is that?

1423
00:59:49,856 --> 00:59:51,124
Come on, five it.

1424
00:59:51,157 --> 00:59:53,893
No. You know,
it feels strange

1425
00:59:53,927 --> 00:59:57,297
to high-five over the custody
of my unborn child.

1426
00:59:57,331 --> 00:59:58,666
I've been on Dusty's team.

1427
00:59:58,699 --> 01:00:01,235
I'm trying to jump over
to the winning team Brad.

1428
01:00:01,268 --> 01:00:03,269
I'd really rather not.

1429
01:00:03,302 --> 01:00:06,007
I'm trying to share a moment
with you here. Please five me.

1430
01:00:06,039 --> 01:00:07,909
It feels... No, thanks.

1431
01:00:08,441 --> 01:00:09,225
Got it!

1432
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:10,010
Wait. No.

1433
01:00:10,043 --> 01:00:11,210
It didn't count.

1434
01:00:11,244 --> 01:00:12,478
I love you, Brad.

1435
01:00:12,512 --> 01:00:13,780
It's not a binding
high-five.

1436
01:00:13,813 --> 01:00:14,949
Fat beans in there.

1437
01:00:16,050 --> 01:00:16,784
Dusty?

1438
01:00:16,819 --> 01:00:17,518
Brad.

1439
01:00:18,052 --> 01:00:19,887
What can I do for you?

1440
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:22,090
Wow, that's some
impressive up-downs.

1441
01:00:22,690 --> 01:00:23,825
Look,

1442
01:00:25,159 --> 01:00:28,929
what you did for
Sara and me,

1443
01:00:28,963 --> 01:00:30,098
that's a life-changer, and

1444
01:00:31,164 --> 01:00:32,699
I just wanted to
say thank you.

1445
01:00:33,133 --> 01:00:35,034
And I'm sorry.

1446
01:00:35,068 --> 01:00:36,371
Sorry for what?

1447
01:00:37,103 --> 01:00:38,839
Well, here's the thing.

1448
01:00:39,574 --> 01:00:42,076
I mean, you show up,

1449
01:00:43,543 --> 01:00:47,480
here's this guy
who's cool and exciting.

1450
01:00:47,514 --> 01:00:50,816
I guess I felt
a little competitive,

1451
01:00:50,851 --> 01:00:52,586
and slightly insecure,
and I start thinking,

1452
01:00:52,619 --> 01:00:54,856
well, maybe you want
to challenge me.

1453
01:00:56,657 --> 01:00:58,925
But today you proved that
all you really care about

1454
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:00,161
is our family's happiness.

1455
01:01:00,193 --> 01:01:01,761
Man.

1456
01:01:01,762 --> 01:01:03,230
I'm humbled.

1457
01:01:03,264 --> 01:01:05,499
I mean it.
And you know what?

1458
01:01:05,532 --> 01:01:08,068
You're right.
I was challenging you, Brad.

1459
01:01:08,101 --> 01:01:09,469
The truth?

1460
01:01:10,570 --> 01:01:12,538
I see this new
man in my kids' life.

1461
01:01:12,572 --> 01:01:13,940
He's kind and caring
and successful,

1462
01:01:13,974 --> 01:01:15,008
and I don't even
want to like you.

1463
01:01:16,008 --> 01:01:18,045
But I can't help it.
I like you, Brad.

1464
01:01:18,878 --> 01:01:20,347
Really?

1465
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:22,648
I was determined to push you
out and get my family back.

1466
01:01:22,682 --> 01:01:25,184
I was underhanded and
disingenuous about it.

1467
01:01:25,219 --> 01:01:26,586
I feel like a monster.

1468
01:01:26,619 --> 01:01:28,522
No. No, no, no.

1469
01:01:30,757 --> 01:01:34,427
At the risk of being disrespectful,
I want you to shut your mouth.

1470
01:01:34,461 --> 01:01:38,266
You are allowed to have
those feelings. Okay?

1471
01:01:38,298 --> 01:01:40,434
Heck, we're talking about your own
children here, for cripes' sake.

1472
01:01:41,902 --> 01:01:42,936
Clean slate?

1473
01:01:43,436 --> 01:01:44,739
Absolutely.

1474
01:01:45,472 --> 01:01:46,606
Come here.

1475
01:01:49,976 --> 01:01:52,212
You know what's funny?
You're not even sweating,

1476
01:01:52,246 --> 01:01:54,146
after doing all those
push-ups.

1477
01:01:54,181 --> 01:01:55,148
That's exemplary.

1478
01:01:59,519 --> 01:02:00,921
Thank you, Dusty.

1479
01:02:00,954 --> 01:02:01,755
Thank you, Brad.

1480
01:02:07,126 --> 01:02:11,431
You know, all that stuff about pushing
me out and taking over my family,

1481
01:02:11,465 --> 01:02:13,400
I mean, we're through
all that, right?

1482
01:02:13,434 --> 01:02:15,402
No, no, no.
I'm here to defeat you

1483
01:02:15,436 --> 01:02:17,371
and take back my family.
That can't change.

1484
01:02:17,405 --> 01:02:20,240
But now I'll follow your noble
example and do it above board.

1485
01:02:20,273 --> 01:02:23,543
Honestly. Like a man.
Like you.

1486
01:02:23,577 --> 01:02:26,980
But we just hugged.
You said you like me.

1487
01:02:27,012 --> 01:02:28,516
I do like you,
Brad, very much.

1488
01:02:28,548 --> 01:02:30,184
It doesn't make
this any easier.

1489
01:02:30,217 --> 01:02:32,719
You know I'm gonna have to tell
Sara what you said in here today.

1490
01:02:32,753 --> 01:02:35,188
Of course. It would be
irresponsible not to.

1491
01:02:35,222 --> 01:02:36,857
She's not gonna like it.
She's gonna want you out.

1492
01:02:36,891 --> 01:02:38,258
You're right
about that, Brad.

1493
01:02:38,291 --> 01:02:39,625
What the hell
are you up to?

1494
01:02:39,659 --> 01:02:41,360
I just told you
what I'm up to.

1495
01:02:41,394 --> 01:02:43,730
My head is spinning
right now.

1496
01:02:43,764 --> 01:02:46,099
Hey, you got any sweet
potatoes? Or yams?

1497
01:02:46,132 --> 01:02:47,634
Sweet potatoes or yams?

1498
01:02:47,668 --> 01:02:49,970
Griff, you know we
have yams, all right?

1499
01:02:50,003 --> 01:02:51,971
You made me
buy them for you.

1500
01:02:52,005 --> 01:02:53,907
I wanted to respect
your house by asking you

1501
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:56,108
before I got them. I didn't
want to just go grab yams.

1502
01:02:56,143 --> 01:02:57,978
Okay, I appreciate that.
I'm dealing with something.

1503
01:02:58,012 --> 01:03:00,480
Just go get the yams.

1504
01:03:00,514 --> 01:03:02,450
Here's the thing.
You're right, Dusty.

1505
01:03:02,483 --> 01:03:04,885
Yeah. I'm not going
to tell Sara.

1506
01:03:04,918 --> 01:03:06,853
But I'm gonna prove to you
that I'm the best.

1507
01:03:06,887 --> 01:03:09,789
You can eat my dust, Dusty.

1508
01:03:26,005 --> 01:03:29,442
Christmas already?
Why didn't anybody tell me?

1509
01:03:29,476 --> 01:03:30,878
It's not.
It's the middle of April.

1510
01:03:33,112 --> 01:03:35,315
Daddy must have
done this!

1511
01:03:35,316 --> 01:03:35,350
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

1512
01:03:36,248 --> 01:03:37,984
No, he didn't.

1513
01:03:38,652 --> 01:03:39,836
Brad.

1514
01:03:39,871 --> 01:03:41,021
Ho, ho!

1515
01:03:41,054 --> 01:03:43,389
Claus is the name.
Santa Claus, if you please.

1516
01:03:43,423 --> 01:03:45,425
But this Brad you speak of

1517
01:03:45,458 --> 01:03:47,161
called me all the way up
at the North Pole.

1518
01:03:47,193 --> 01:03:50,096
He said his children
were so sad because

1519
01:03:50,130 --> 01:03:52,599
their biological father
had missed so many

1520
01:03:52,632 --> 01:03:55,067
Christmases and birthdays

1521
01:03:55,101 --> 01:03:57,804
and special family holidays,
so he asked me

1522
01:03:57,838 --> 01:04:00,608
to come here today
so that Dusty

1523
01:04:00,641 --> 01:04:02,809
could experience
one Christmas

1524
01:04:02,842 --> 01:04:04,344
with his kids before
he leaves again.

1525
01:04:05,244 --> 01:04:06,545
Probably for a long,
long time.

1526
01:04:06,579 --> 01:04:07,748
Ho, ho, ho!

1527
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:09,616
Can we open presents?

1528
01:04:09,650 --> 01:04:11,518
You sure can,
little girl.

1529
01:04:11,550 --> 01:04:13,119
I think they're
from Brad.

1530
01:04:13,152 --> 01:04:15,655
In fact, all the presents
are from Brad.

1531
01:04:15,690 --> 01:04:17,791
Let's see if any of the
presents are from Dusty.

1532
01:04:19,025 --> 01:04:23,462
Nope. Not one present
from Dusty. All from Brad.

1533
01:04:23,496 --> 01:04:26,499
Hey, kids, let's not forget
who got you a dog. Remember?

1534
01:04:26,534 --> 01:04:28,168
Hey, Tumor,
quit humping Mrs. Claus!

1535
01:04:29,836 --> 01:04:31,938
Okay, I am officially
worried about you.

1536
01:04:31,972 --> 01:04:33,941
Don't worry,
Claus hasn't forgotten you.

1537
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:37,444
For me?

1538
01:04:37,479 --> 01:04:38,179
Yeah.

1539
01:04:40,981 --> 01:04:44,618
My God, honey, it's
beautiful. I love it.

1540
01:04:44,650 --> 01:04:47,654
Wait, no! No!
No, no. It's too much.

1541
01:04:49,489 --> 01:04:53,693
No, it looks like Tumor's
given away Megan's big gift.

1542
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:02,635
A pony! A pony! A pony!

1543
01:05:02,668 --> 01:05:04,704
I know, it's a pony!

1544
01:05:04,737 --> 01:05:06,672
Ho, ho, ho!

1545
01:05:06,706 --> 01:05:09,677
It's a pony, Dusty!
A pony!

1546
01:05:09,710 --> 01:05:11,311
Can we name her
Princess Elsa?

1547
01:05:11,344 --> 01:05:14,414
You can name him whatever
you want, because it's yours!

1548
01:05:15,483 --> 01:05:16,749
Brad, how can
we afford a pony?

1549
01:05:16,784 --> 01:05:18,251
Where are we even
going to put that thing?

1550
01:05:18,284 --> 01:05:20,487
I can clear out some stable
space in the garage.

1551
01:05:20,519 --> 01:05:22,855
Look, it's only
half a horse.

1552
01:05:22,889 --> 01:05:25,959
Okay? Think of it like
a big dog, only a lot better.

1553
01:05:25,992 --> 01:05:28,362
What's this?
What the heck?

1554
01:05:28,394 --> 01:05:31,798
It's tickets to tonight's
NBA playoff game...

1555
01:05:31,831 --> 01:05:33,532
against Dylan's
favorite team,

1556
01:05:33,566 --> 01:05:35,001
the Los Angeles Lakers?

1557
01:05:35,034 --> 01:05:37,303
Thanks, Brad!
You're the coolest!

1558
01:05:37,336 --> 01:05:38,672
I love you, Brad!

1559
01:05:39,072 --> 01:05:40,240
Not bad.

1560
01:05:41,141 --> 01:05:42,508
Not bad at all.

1561
01:05:42,543 --> 01:05:44,412
Merry Christmas,
Whitaker family!

1562
01:05:44,878 --> 01:05:45,946
Christmas?

1563
01:05:46,947 --> 01:05:48,382
How long was I asleep for?

1564
01:05:57,057 --> 01:05:58,692
You guys got
enough candy?

1565
01:05:58,726 --> 01:06:00,693
Remember, you can have anything
you want, 'cause it's Christmas!

1566
01:06:00,728 --> 01:06:03,030
No, it isn't. It's not
Christmas, kids.

1567
01:06:03,063 --> 01:06:04,564
All right.
Here we are.

1568
01:06:04,599 --> 01:06:06,066
Sick! We're this close?

1569
01:06:06,099 --> 01:06:08,702
Yeah. Pretty good, right?
Megan, you sit down right there.

1570
01:06:08,735 --> 01:06:11,037
Perfect. Dylan,
you sit next to me.

1571
01:06:11,070 --> 01:06:13,806
And, Dusty,
I'm so sorry. Yeah.

1572
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:15,742
I could only get four in
a row. I couldn't get five.

1573
01:06:15,777 --> 01:06:17,278
So you're across the aisle,
next to that gentleman.

1574
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:20,681
All right, guys,
I'll be right here.

1575
01:06:20,715 --> 01:06:21,983
We can still chat.

1576
01:06:21,984 --> 01:06:22,018
Bye, Daddy.

1577
01:06:24,018 --> 01:06:27,755
Look, there's Kobe! It's him!
He's right there.

1578
01:06:27,787 --> 01:06:30,724
Thank you, Brad, this is the
best present I've ever gotten.

1579
01:06:30,757 --> 01:06:31,808
You are so welcome.

1580
01:06:31,843 --> 01:06:32,859
In my whole life.

1581
01:06:32,894 --> 01:06:34,762
I'm glad to hear it's the
best present you've ever got!

1582
01:06:36,429 --> 01:06:37,931
How much did
these seats cost?

1583
01:06:37,965 --> 01:06:39,499
Not too much.

1584
01:06:39,532 --> 01:06:40,934
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
let's give a big welcome</i>

1585
01:06:40,967 --> 01:06:43,202
<i>to all the kids from
Hearts of Courage.</i>

1586
01:06:43,237 --> 01:06:46,106
Whoo! Hearts of
Courage kids!

1587
01:06:46,139 --> 01:06:47,775
Proud of you,
you're all miracles!

1588
01:06:48,909 --> 01:06:50,344
Whoo! I love kids!

1589
01:06:50,376 --> 01:06:51,778
All right, honey.
That's plenty.

1590
01:06:51,811 --> 01:06:53,580
I just get excited
when I'm with my family!

1591
01:06:54,215 --> 01:06:56,316
Dusty! Dusty Mayron!

1592
01:06:57,016 --> 01:06:58,818
Marco? Hey!

1593
01:06:58,853 --> 01:07:00,787
What's up, man?
Are you coaching now?

1594
01:07:00,820 --> 01:07:01,989
Yeah, I'm the new strength
and conditioning coach.

1595
01:07:02,021 --> 01:07:03,257
Check you out.

1596
01:07:03,289 --> 01:07:04,659
Hey, I played ball
with him in Italy.

1597
01:07:04,691 --> 01:07:06,626
This is my family.
My little guy, Dylan.

1598
01:07:06,659 --> 01:07:08,461
He's the biggest Kobe
fan in the world.

1599
01:07:08,496 --> 01:07:10,331
Really? Well, come on down.
I'll introduce you.

1600
01:07:10,364 --> 01:07:11,865
What? You hear that?

1601
01:07:11,898 --> 01:07:13,101
You want to meet Kobe?

1602
01:07:13,133 --> 01:07:14,233
Bring the whole
family down.

1603
01:07:14,268 --> 01:07:15,702
You guys can sit
with the team.

1604
01:07:15,735 --> 01:07:16,903
Hey, this is my
little girl, Megan.

1605
01:07:16,936 --> 01:07:18,772
She just invited me to her
first Daddy-Daughter Dance.

1606
01:07:18,806 --> 01:07:19,974
What did he just say?

1607
01:07:21,675 --> 01:07:23,576
What the hell
did he just say?

1608
01:07:23,610 --> 01:07:25,311
Sorry. He's okay.

1609
01:07:25,344 --> 01:07:27,147
No, I'm not okay.
He's not okay.

1610
01:07:27,181 --> 01:07:28,132
Honey, you need to calm down.

1611
01:07:28,167 --> 01:07:29,083
No! I'm not gonna calm down.

1612
01:07:29,115 --> 01:07:30,550
She asked me first!

1613
01:07:30,583 --> 01:07:33,019
And now she's asking him?
No. It's not fair.

1614
01:07:33,052 --> 01:07:35,522
You know what, actually, it's
very fair. Okay? She has two dads.

1615
01:07:35,556 --> 01:07:37,490
She wants you both there.
You just have to accept that.

1616
01:07:37,523 --> 01:07:39,692
No, I'm not going to
accept it. All right?

1617
01:07:39,726 --> 01:07:42,362
I do pick-up!
I do drop-off!

1618
01:07:42,396 --> 01:07:43,998
Okay, I volunteer
at school!

1619
01:07:44,030 --> 01:07:46,366
I listen to the tantrums
and the crying

1620
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:50,269
<i>and the soundtrack of Frozen that's
on a goddamn loop all the time!</i>

1621
01:07:50,304 --> 01:07:52,740
And he just waltzes in
for a few days,

1622
01:07:52,773 --> 01:07:55,409
and now he gets to
go as well? No!

1623
01:07:55,443 --> 01:07:57,945
No, she's got to choose.
It's either me or him!

1624
01:07:57,978 --> 01:07:59,613
Megan, you got to choose!

1625
01:07:59,646 --> 01:08:00,980
You got to choose!

1626
01:08:01,014 --> 01:08:02,215
It's the biggest decision
of your life!

1627
01:08:02,248 --> 01:08:04,518
Hey!

1628
01:08:04,552 --> 01:08:07,054
You know what? I'm going to pretend
you're not acting like a crazy person,

1629
01:08:07,088 --> 01:08:08,523
because I know
you're very upset.

1630
01:08:09,490 --> 01:08:11,726
But you need to get
over yourself. Okay?

1631
01:08:11,759 --> 01:08:14,194
Now go down there and
be happy with your kids.

1632
01:08:14,227 --> 01:08:17,331
No! A scalper gouged me 18 grand for
these seats. I'm not leaving them!

1633
01:08:18,031 --> 01:08:19,599
What?

1634
01:08:19,634 --> 01:08:21,769
What did you just say?

1635
01:08:21,802 --> 01:08:25,606
Yeah. Nothing. Let's
just... You're right.

1636
01:08:25,638 --> 01:08:28,441
I'm so much more
relaxed now. Thank you.

1637
01:08:28,474 --> 01:08:29,610
Yeah. Let's just go
down... Let's just...

1638
01:08:29,643 --> 01:08:30,878
No!

1639
01:08:30,911 --> 01:08:33,847
I think you should sit
in your $18,000 seats,

1640
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:35,982
and think of all the better
ways your family

1641
01:08:36,016 --> 01:08:36,884
could have used that money.

1642
01:08:38,818 --> 01:08:39,821
Sara.

1643
01:08:41,589 --> 01:08:43,157
The guy from
the nuclear sub thing?

1644
01:08:43,191 --> 01:08:44,175
Mayron! That's him.

1645
01:08:44,210 --> 01:08:45,159
That's the guy?

1646
01:08:45,192 --> 01:08:47,895
Can I get some beers down
here? Can I get five beers?

1647
01:08:49,196 --> 01:08:50,498
Excuse me, some beers!

1648
01:09:27,668 --> 01:09:29,503
<i>What's up, everybody?</i>

1649
01:09:29,535 --> 01:09:32,405
<i>Let's make some noise!</i>

1650
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:34,442
<i>Whoo-hoo!</i>

1651
01:09:34,474 --> 01:09:37,710
<i>Tonight, one lucky
fan is going to</i>

1652
01:09:37,744 --> 01:09:40,514
<i>get a chance to
shoot from half court</i>

1653
01:09:40,548 --> 01:09:43,785
<i>to win a family vacation
to Disney World!</i>

1654
01:09:47,553 --> 01:09:50,923
<i>And our lucky fan
is sitting in</i>

1655
01:09:50,958 --> 01:09:52,960
<i>section 113,</i>

1656
01:09:53,427 --> 01:09:55,629
<i>row 6,</i>

1657
01:09:55,662 --> 01:09:59,098
<i>C-1. Where is he?
Let's see it. Where is he?</i>

1658
01:09:59,132 --> 01:10:00,668
It's me. It's me, I win!

1659
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:01,902
<i>There he is.</i>

1660
01:10:01,903 --> 01:10:01,937
I win.

1661
01:10:03,570 --> 01:10:06,040
I'm-a make it to Disneyland.
I'm-a make it all right.

1662
01:10:06,072 --> 01:10:07,273
All right, Brad!

1663
01:10:07,274 --> 01:10:08,258
Yay, Brad!

1664
01:10:08,293 --> 01:10:09,243
Yay, Brad!

1665
01:10:09,276 --> 01:10:11,211
<i>All right, sir, how you doing?
What's your name?</i>

1666
01:10:11,245 --> 01:10:13,848
<i>First off,
I love my kids.</i>

1667
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:15,182
<i>He loves his kids!
Let's give it up!</i>

1668
01:10:18,151 --> 01:10:21,522
<i>And if anyone was ever
to do anything to them,</i>

1669
01:10:21,554 --> 01:10:23,523
<i>I would hurt them.</i>

1670
01:10:23,524 --> 01:10:23,558
<i>Okay.</i>

1671
01:10:24,258 --> 01:10:25,927
<i>I would freakin' hurt them!</i>

1672
01:10:26,526 --> 01:10:28,528
<i>Okay.</i>

1673
01:10:28,562 --> 01:10:30,731
<i>This guy over here
is trying to take them!</i>

1674
01:10:30,763 --> 01:10:32,199
<i>Trying to steal my family.</i>

1675
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:34,202
<i>He doesn't sweat!</i>

1676
01:10:35,568 --> 01:10:36,836
<i>Okay, you know what?
Why don't we just shoot...</i>

1677
01:10:36,870 --> 01:10:39,005
<i>But I got news
for you, buddy!</i>

1678
01:10:39,039 --> 01:10:41,575
<i>Last night, while you
were sleeping,</i>

1679
01:10:41,608 --> 01:10:43,009
<i>I made love to our wife!</i>

1680
01:10:43,544 --> 01:10:44,745
<i>My wife!</i>

1681
01:10:45,678 --> 01:10:48,514
<i>Sara, right over there!</i>

1682
01:10:48,548 --> 01:10:50,383
<i>Took my wiener
out of my pants!</i>

1683
01:10:50,416 --> 01:10:52,352
This is a family
event, okay?

1684
01:10:52,385 --> 01:10:53,219
<i>Boo! Boo!</i>

1685
01:10:53,254 --> 01:10:54,053
All right.

1686
01:10:54,086 --> 01:10:56,089
<i>So,</i>

1687
01:10:56,123 --> 01:10:59,259
<i>even if Sara does pick you,
you're going to have to be</i>

1688
01:10:59,293 --> 01:11:01,461
<i>the stepdad to my kid!</i>

1689
01:11:01,495 --> 01:11:04,498
<i>You see how you
like it! Okay?</i>

1690
01:11:04,531 --> 01:11:06,900
<i>Let's get somebody else down
here, all right? Somebody else...</i>

1691
01:11:06,933 --> 01:11:08,601
<i>Somebody else is going to win
a family trip!</i>

1692
01:11:08,634 --> 01:11:10,504
Give me that ball, you.

1693
01:11:10,537 --> 01:11:13,174
<i>This one's for Dylan and Megan
and Sara and Dylan.</i>

1694
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:16,142
<i>Nothing but net.</i>

1695
01:11:16,177 --> 01:11:17,844
<i>All right, he's going
for it! Nothing but net!</i>

1696
01:11:26,253 --> 01:11:27,621
Do-over!

1697
01:11:27,653 --> 01:11:28,404
That's a do-over!

1698
01:11:28,439 --> 01:11:29,156
No do-over. No.

1699
01:11:29,188 --> 01:11:30,258
It's a do-over!

1700
01:11:55,316 --> 01:11:58,152
<i>I'm so sorry you had to
see that. I'm so sorry.</i>

1701
01:12:34,188 --> 01:12:36,124
Hey, kids, why don't you go
inside and put on your pajamas?

1702
01:12:39,926 --> 01:12:42,397
-What are you doing?
-I'm comforting you.

1703
01:12:43,997 --> 01:12:47,468
Sara, look... Sorry,
too soon. I know.

1704
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:50,036
But I just want you to know that
I'm here for you and the kids.

1705
01:12:50,071 --> 01:12:52,506
Really? You want to be a real
parent now? Is that what this is?

1706
01:12:52,539 --> 01:12:53,808
Absolutely. I'm here now.

1707
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:56,042
Dusty, I'm working
crazy hours this week.

1708
01:12:56,076 --> 01:12:58,444
With Brad gone, the kids are
gonna have to be dropped off,

1709
01:12:58,478 --> 01:13:00,580
picked up, taken to
swimming lessons.

1710
01:13:00,613 --> 01:13:03,084
Dylan has a play date
with Eli on Tuesday,

1711
01:13:03,117 --> 01:13:05,719
and Megan has a dentist
appointment on Friday.

1712
01:13:05,752 --> 01:13:08,322
Sara, I know in the past
I've been unreliable,

1713
01:13:08,356 --> 01:13:10,191
but this is a new me. All
right? This is the new Dusty.

1714
01:13:11,825 --> 01:13:14,126
Well, you can't take them
to school on a motorcycle.

1715
01:13:14,161 --> 01:13:15,465
-You need a car.
-Done.

1716
01:13:16,731 --> 01:13:17,764
Okay.

1717
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,602
Hey! You're not staying here!

1718
01:13:22,635 --> 01:13:24,136
Are you sure you don't need
company right now?

1719
01:13:24,170 --> 01:13:25,472
I mean, you're going through
a tough transition here.

1720
01:13:25,505 --> 01:13:27,073
Be here at 6:30
tomorrow morning.

1721
01:13:27,107 --> 01:13:28,242
Well, can I at least
come in and get my stuff?

1722
01:13:28,274 --> 01:13:29,943
No!

1723
01:13:29,977 --> 01:13:31,979
I'm gonna wait for a while,
in case you change your mind.

1724
01:13:36,884 --> 01:13:37,852
Hey.

1725
01:13:39,886 --> 01:13:41,188
What did you throw
Griff out for?

1726
01:13:43,424 --> 01:13:45,526
This place is chaotic.

1727
01:13:45,559 --> 01:13:47,294
There's always some bullshit
going on in that house.

1728
01:13:47,327 --> 01:13:49,129
God, man. Want to go to
the Red Roof Inn?

1729
01:13:49,162 --> 01:13:50,696
Let's do it.

1730
01:13:50,731 --> 01:13:52,934
-Is that Cinnamon Toast Crunch?
-Yes, sir.

1731
01:14:17,657 --> 01:14:19,425
Okay. No running!

1732
01:14:19,459 --> 01:14:21,929
All right. Lindsey! Sloane!
Car's open right down there!

1733
01:14:21,961 --> 01:14:25,499
Okay, sir, inside the cones!
Just like ice cream!

1734
01:14:25,532 --> 01:14:26,734
Keep it inside...

1735
01:14:26,767 --> 01:14:28,434
That's right! Thank you.

1736
01:14:34,474 --> 01:14:37,510
Hi. I see you've been picking up
Megan and Dylan these past few days.

1737
01:14:37,545 --> 01:14:39,145
Should I expect you
from now on?

1738
01:14:39,179 --> 01:14:41,582
Yeah, I'm their real dad,
so yeah, from now on.

1739
01:14:41,615 --> 01:14:43,483
Terrific. I see
that you also

1740
01:14:43,517 --> 01:14:45,685
haven't signed up to
volunteer in the lane.

1741
01:14:45,719 --> 01:14:48,422
Brad was so good about
helping us out in the lane,

1742
01:14:48,455 --> 01:14:50,223
in the classroom,
PTA, and so forth.

1743
01:14:50,256 --> 01:14:52,692
We could always count on him
for bake sales, Spring Sing,

1744
01:14:52,725 --> 01:14:54,728
costumes for Winter Pageant.
You know the drill.

1745
01:14:54,761 --> 01:14:56,897
I hope I can count on you
to be the new Brad.

1746
01:14:56,929 --> 01:14:59,031
Sure, yeah.
You can count on me.

1747
01:14:59,066 --> 01:15:01,669
I mean, I'm their real dad, so,
yeah, I'll be here every day.

1748
01:15:01,701 --> 01:15:04,403
Great. So, if your kids aren't out here,
I'm gonna need you to circle around

1749
01:15:04,437 --> 01:15:05,572
to the back
of the line. Okay?

1750
01:15:05,606 --> 01:15:07,640
No, I can't go around.

1751
01:15:07,674 --> 01:15:09,076
I came ten minutes early
so I don't have to...

1752
01:15:09,108 --> 01:15:11,144
If your kids aren't here,
you have to go around!

1753
01:15:11,178 --> 01:15:12,979
I know. There's somebody
in front of me. Okay?

1754
01:15:13,014 --> 01:15:14,181
Just go around!

1755
01:15:14,215 --> 01:15:16,450
I can't just go over the
cones! I'm boxed in here!

1756
01:15:16,483 --> 01:15:18,151
No, you can't! Okay?

1757
01:15:18,184 --> 01:15:19,618
She said stay in the cone,
like ice cream!

1758
01:15:19,652 --> 01:15:21,287
Go around!

1759
01:15:21,321 --> 01:15:22,723
Inside the cones!

1760
01:15:22,755 --> 01:15:24,490
Amanda has got a recital!

1761
01:15:24,524 --> 01:15:27,060
I have to get there!
You need to go!

1762
01:15:32,633 --> 01:15:34,600
Hey!

1763
01:15:34,634 --> 01:15:36,770
We always stay
inside the cones!

1764
01:15:37,403 --> 01:15:39,205
Cones!

1765
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:41,908
Cones! Come on!

1766
01:15:47,147 --> 01:15:49,684
Have you been living here
for the last few days, Brad?

1767
01:15:49,983 --> 01:15:50,885
No.

1768
01:15:52,085 --> 01:15:56,023
Then what's with the blankets
and the hot plate

1769
01:15:56,756 --> 01:15:57,825
and the B.O.?

1770
01:15:58,625 --> 01:16:01,061
I crapped in
the wastebasket.

1771
01:16:02,228 --> 01:16:06,131
You know, Brad, two years
into my thing with Charlene,

1772
01:16:06,166 --> 01:16:09,169
her first husband showed up.
Oriental fellow.

1773
01:16:09,201 --> 01:16:12,238
You can't say that.
You cannot say "Oriental."

1774
01:16:12,273 --> 01:16:16,777
His name was Yu or Wu.
It could have been Javier.

1775
01:16:16,809 --> 01:16:20,180
Anyway, I get off early
one day, get home, and

1776
01:16:20,214 --> 01:16:22,582
there he is, stark
naked in our bed.

1777
01:16:22,616 --> 01:16:23,850
I didn't know
what to think.

1778
01:16:23,884 --> 01:16:26,920
Really? You didn't
know what to think?

1779
01:16:26,953 --> 01:16:30,491
Six months later,
I wake up in a Chinese prison

1780
01:16:30,523 --> 01:16:32,825
with a tattoo on
my lower back

1781
01:16:32,858 --> 01:16:35,161
of a golf ball rolling
towards my butthole.

1782
01:16:35,196 --> 01:16:37,264
I can't hear these
stories anymore.

1783
01:16:37,296 --> 01:16:39,499
I'm sorry. I know
they're supposed to help...

1784
01:16:39,532 --> 01:16:41,968
Griff! What are you
doing here?

1785
01:16:42,001 --> 01:16:44,405
Thought you should know
Dusty came by the bar earlier.

1786
01:16:44,438 --> 01:16:46,407
He was talking about how
he can't do the daddy thing.

1787
01:16:46,439 --> 01:16:47,907
I tried to talk some
sense into him,

1788
01:16:47,942 --> 01:16:49,510
but he seemed determined
to get out of town.

1789
01:16:49,542 --> 01:16:50,745
What, he's leaving?

1790
01:16:50,777 --> 01:16:52,045
I don't think
I have to tell you,

1791
01:16:52,078 --> 01:16:54,014
but little Megan's
dance is tonight,

1792
01:16:54,046 --> 01:16:55,448
and she's not going to
have a daddy.

1793
01:16:55,483 --> 01:16:58,319
That's fantastic.
Brad, you win.

1794
01:16:58,352 --> 01:17:02,089
And Dusty, because of
an act of cowardice, loses.

1795
01:17:02,122 --> 01:17:03,823
I mean,
you're the daddy again.

1796
01:17:04,291 --> 01:17:05,826
Come on, hit that.

1797
01:17:10,697 --> 01:17:11,899
No, I'm not her daddy.

1798
01:17:13,934 --> 01:17:16,103
I wish more than
anything I was,

1799
01:17:17,470 --> 01:17:19,272
but I'm not.

1800
01:17:19,305 --> 01:17:23,109
Yeah, you're right, Brad. A real dad
wouldn't give up on his kids so easy.

1801
01:17:32,486 --> 01:17:33,586
Griff!

1802
01:17:33,620 --> 01:17:35,955
Wait!

1803
01:17:35,988 --> 01:17:37,258
He's still
in the room, Brad.

1804
01:17:37,624 --> 01:17:39,859
Hey.

1805
01:17:39,893 --> 01:17:42,530
Sorry. I thought
you stormed out.

1806
01:17:42,563 --> 01:17:44,698
What you said sounded
like a storm-out,

1807
01:17:44,731 --> 01:17:46,299
and then I heard
the door close.

1808
01:17:46,332 --> 01:17:48,001
I just thought that shit
was getting kind of personal,

1809
01:17:48,035 --> 01:17:50,036
so it'd be good
to close the door.

1810
01:17:50,069 --> 01:17:53,674
So extremely thoughtful.
Thank you. Yeah.

1811
01:17:53,706 --> 01:17:57,176
And just so you know
where my head was at,

1812
01:17:57,210 --> 01:17:59,179
I was going to chase you
down the hallway. Right?

1813
01:18:00,112 --> 01:18:01,548
You'd hear my footsteps
and you're like,

1814
01:18:01,581 --> 01:18:03,082
"Is someone after...
What's going on?"

1815
01:18:03,116 --> 01:18:07,020
Boom! It's me, and I'm like,
"Griff, hey!

1816
01:18:07,487 --> 01:18:08,989
"You were right."

1817
01:18:09,022 --> 01:18:12,158
Holy shit! That
would be so uplifting.

1818
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:14,295
Can we do that?

1819
01:18:15,830 --> 01:18:17,832
Griff, can you storm out,
and Brad, you go after him?

1820
01:18:17,865 --> 01:18:19,965
I don't really want
any part of that.

1821
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,569
That sounds like
pure nonsense to me.

1822
01:18:22,603 --> 01:18:24,337
I don't want...
I'd rather not.

1823
01:18:25,104 --> 01:18:27,707
We could just try it,
you know?

1824
01:18:27,741 --> 01:18:31,645
No, that sounds forced
and weird to try to

1825
01:18:31,678 --> 01:18:34,280
recreate something.
Not even recreate.

1826
01:18:34,313 --> 01:18:36,649
It would be creating.
It didn't happen.

1827
01:18:36,683 --> 01:18:38,618
It's over-discussed
at this point.

1828
01:18:38,652 --> 01:18:39,586
Shouldn't you
go see your kid?

1829
01:18:39,618 --> 01:18:40,436
Yeah. Yeah.

1830
01:18:40,471 --> 01:18:41,255
All right.

1831
01:18:41,287 --> 01:18:42,889
You guys go.
Brad, can I come?

1832
01:18:42,923 --> 01:18:44,224
No.

1833
01:18:57,470 --> 01:18:59,339
Daddy's not coming, is he?

1834
01:18:59,372 --> 01:19:02,942
Honey, he'll be here.
He promised.

1835
01:19:04,710 --> 01:19:06,446
I see cupcakes
over there.

1836
01:19:07,648 --> 01:19:09,917
I think you should
go eat some. Go on.

1837
01:19:10,984 --> 01:19:12,385
Go eat a lot of sugar.

1838
01:19:28,001 --> 01:19:28,902
Dusty.

1839
01:19:30,103 --> 01:19:32,475
-No.
-Come on, Dusty.

1840
01:19:32,522 --> 01:19:33,924
Where are you going?

1841
01:19:33,956 --> 01:19:36,125
I'd pay a billion dollars
to take her to that dance.

1842
01:19:36,158 --> 01:19:38,194
You're just gonna leave?

1843
01:19:38,228 --> 01:19:40,630
I can't take her. Okay?
I'm not welcome after I said

1844
01:19:40,664 --> 01:19:42,131
I was gonna put a spite baby
in her mother.

1845
01:19:42,166 --> 01:19:44,181
-I guess that's out, then.
-Yeah, that is out.

1846
01:19:44,182 --> 01:19:45,781
So it's gotta be you.

1847
01:19:46,336 --> 01:19:49,138
I'm sorry, Brad, I just
can't do it, all right?

1848
01:19:49,173 --> 01:19:50,707
What do you mean,
you can't do it?

1849
01:19:50,741 --> 01:19:52,843
I can't stay
inside the cones.

1850
01:19:52,875 --> 01:19:54,911
Look, Dusty, the cones are
there for everyone's safety.

1851
01:19:54,946 --> 01:19:56,279
It's not about the cones.

1852
01:19:56,314 --> 01:19:57,613
You just said it was...

1853
01:19:57,647 --> 01:19:59,049
The cones are
a metaphor, Brad.

1854
01:19:59,082 --> 01:20:01,751
I'm not the domestic
type, okay?

1855
01:20:01,785 --> 01:20:03,120
Dusty, come on. What
are you talking about?

1856
01:20:03,152 --> 01:20:05,145
You're organized,
you're handy.

1857
01:20:05,455 --> 01:20:07,657
You make the best cinnamon
rolls I have ever tasted.

1858
01:20:07,691 --> 01:20:09,093
Those were Cinnabons,
Brad. Come on.

1859
01:20:09,125 --> 01:20:11,027
You can't make rolls like
that in a conventional oven.

1860
01:20:11,061 --> 01:20:14,898
I knew it! I knew it.
I knew it from the beginning!

1861
01:20:14,932 --> 01:20:16,467
So you've been telling
some tall tales?

1862
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:17,568
All that Special Ops stuff.

1863
01:20:17,603 --> 01:20:18,636
No, just the Cinnabons!

1864
01:20:18,669 --> 01:20:20,437
Why would you lie
about Cinnabons?

1865
01:20:20,470 --> 01:20:22,606
'Cause I wanted
to win. All right?

1866
01:20:22,639 --> 01:20:24,807
I wanted to prove that I was
a good dad, too, but I'm not.

1867
01:20:24,842 --> 01:20:27,245
Okay? Are you happy? Is
that what you want to hear?

1868
01:20:27,277 --> 01:20:29,646
All the noise and the mess
and all the choices.

1869
01:20:29,679 --> 01:20:31,048
You do one thing wrong, you
can screw them up for life.

1870
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:34,284
Do you realize that?

1871
01:20:34,317 --> 01:20:35,518
Dads have to make
a lot of choices, okay?

1872
01:20:35,552 --> 01:20:36,954
And we blow most of them.

1873
01:20:36,986 --> 01:20:38,388
Yeah, and the other parents.

1874
01:20:38,422 --> 01:20:41,459
That kid, Eli. I was over there for
a play date. You know about this?

1875
01:20:41,491 --> 01:20:43,059
You can't just ride your bike
over to a friend's house,

1876
01:20:43,093 --> 01:20:44,228
to play Hot Wheels anymore,

1877
01:20:44,260 --> 01:20:45,629
now you got to make
some kind of date?

1878
01:20:45,662 --> 01:20:46,379
I know, it's a shame.

1879
01:20:46,414 --> 01:20:47,097
Well, I'm over there,

1880
01:20:47,130 --> 01:20:49,199
and the kid's dad keeps
asking me if Dylan's gonna be

1881
01:20:49,232 --> 01:20:50,601
in the gifted program
with Eli.

1882
01:20:50,634 --> 01:20:52,469
Like Dylan isn't as smart as
his little ball-scratcher kid.

1883
01:20:52,503 --> 01:20:54,438
I wanted to murder
that smug prick.

1884
01:20:54,472 --> 01:20:57,842
Dusty, look, I hate
that guy, too, okay?

1885
01:20:57,875 --> 01:20:59,944
But his son is Dylan's best
friend, so you suck it up.

1886
01:21:01,845 --> 01:21:06,583
I mean, that's most of
what dads do, is take shit.

1887
01:21:06,616 --> 01:21:08,852
I mean, that's what we do.

1888
01:21:08,885 --> 01:21:11,821
I can't do it, Brad.
I can't take shit like you do.

1889
01:21:11,856 --> 01:21:14,157
You take shit better than
anyone I've ever met,

1890
01:21:14,191 --> 01:21:16,360
and I mean that as a compliment
from the bottom of my heart.

1891
01:21:16,392 --> 01:21:18,028
But I'm sorry, Brad.
I can't.

1892
01:21:18,062 --> 01:21:19,964
I can't do it, man.

1893
01:21:19,996 --> 01:21:21,598
You made a promise to Megan,
and you're gonna keep it.

1894
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:32,642
Did you just punch me
in the face, Brad?

1895
01:21:32,675 --> 01:21:34,245
Yes.

1896
01:21:34,277 --> 01:21:36,646
Knowing full well I got no
choice but to bust you up now?

1897
01:21:36,681 --> 01:21:39,150
I really wish you wouldn't.

1898
01:21:39,183 --> 01:21:41,119
If I did, you'd take that beatdown
for those kids, wouldn't you?

1899
01:21:43,187 --> 01:21:45,590
Yeah. Yeah, I would.

1900
01:21:54,330 --> 01:21:56,933
Good luck, Dusty.

1901
01:21:56,968 --> 01:21:59,570
What? No, no,
you gotta come.

1902
01:21:59,602 --> 01:22:03,440
It's just... I can't see
Sara after what I said.

1903
01:22:03,473 --> 01:22:05,608
Sara loves you, Brad. All right?
I know just what to say to her.

1904
01:22:05,642 --> 01:22:07,544
You just stand there
and look lost without her.

1905
01:22:07,577 --> 01:22:09,746
Well, that's good.
Then let's go.

1906
01:22:09,781 --> 01:22:11,165
But I look terrible.

1907
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:12,549
Yeah, you do. Come here.

1908
01:22:12,581 --> 01:22:13,332
What are you doing?

1909
01:22:13,367 --> 01:22:14,084
I'm fixing you up, man.

1910
01:22:16,753 --> 01:22:18,589
Dusty, get your hands
out of my pants.

1911
01:22:18,621 --> 01:22:20,656
Calm down. Think I want
to touch your little dinky?

1912
01:22:20,691 --> 01:22:22,322
I'm trying to fix you up.

1913
01:22:23,294 --> 01:22:24,495
All right. Let me see.

1914
01:22:26,562 --> 01:22:30,634
-Wow. I look great.
-Here you go.

1915
01:22:30,666 --> 01:22:33,004
-That's incredible.
-Come on.

1916
01:22:38,575 --> 01:22:40,610
Hey, pumpkin.

1917
01:22:40,643 --> 01:22:43,815
Daddy wanted to be here, I
know he did. He just gets...

1918
01:22:57,160 --> 01:22:58,662
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

1919
01:22:58,696 --> 01:23:00,731
She's doing her
arms-folded thing.

1920
01:23:00,764 --> 01:23:05,402
You said she'd smile. Maybe
even start a slow clap.

1921
01:23:05,436 --> 01:23:07,838
Don't worry, I got this.
Okay? Come on.

1922
01:23:07,870 --> 01:23:11,208
Hey, look, it's the guy that
stranded his kids at school.

1923
01:23:11,241 --> 01:23:12,743
And look who he's with.

1924
01:23:12,776 --> 01:23:14,311
Did you get anybody pregnant
on your way over here, Brad?

1925
01:23:14,344 --> 01:23:15,512
No, I didn't.

1926
01:23:15,545 --> 01:23:17,380
-Sara, listen...
-No!

1927
01:23:17,415 --> 01:23:19,516
No. I am not going
to listen to you.

1928
01:23:19,549 --> 01:23:22,320
You know what? Your daughter's been
sitting there for two hours, heartbroken.

1929
01:23:22,352 --> 01:23:25,288
Sara, I am so sorry...

1930
01:23:25,321 --> 01:23:28,992
Just, please. Will one of you idiots
just ask your daughter to dance?

1931
01:23:29,026 --> 01:23:29,910
Really?

1932
01:23:29,945 --> 01:23:30,795
Yes.

1933
01:23:30,827 --> 01:23:33,063
Neither one of you
deserves her, but yes.

1934
01:23:36,098 --> 01:23:37,834
No, you take the first one.

1935
01:23:37,867 --> 01:23:39,236
You've earned it
more than I have.

1936
01:23:39,269 --> 01:23:40,637
Dusty, please,
she's your daughter.

1937
01:23:40,669 --> 01:23:41,705
What the hell did I miss?

1938
01:23:43,473 --> 01:23:47,210
I'll tell you what. I'll vouch for you
to the kids and I'll take the first dance.

1939
01:23:47,244 --> 01:23:49,280
I'll say my good-byes, and
then I'll get out of your hair.

1940
01:23:51,815 --> 01:23:54,218
Wait, wait. When you say
"get out of your hair,"

1941
01:23:54,250 --> 01:23:56,585
you mean leave, like
leave-leave? Tonight?

1942
01:23:56,620 --> 01:23:59,356
Daddy! Brad! The
fourth graders are here.

1943
01:23:59,389 --> 01:24:01,424
They're picking on
Dylan again.

1944
01:24:01,458 --> 01:24:03,393
That's it. Those little
shitheads are dead.

1945
01:24:03,427 --> 01:24:04,528
Where are they?

1946
01:24:06,463 --> 01:24:07,831
Those are
the fourth graders?

1947
01:24:07,864 --> 01:24:09,332
They're girls.

1948
01:24:09,367 --> 01:24:10,800
They're so mean.

1949
01:24:10,834 --> 01:24:12,503
Why are you even here at
the Daddy-Daughter Dance?

1950
01:24:12,535 --> 01:24:14,270
Are you a daughter?
Are you a girl?

1951
01:24:14,303 --> 01:24:17,440
Are you too scared to take me
on without your little friends?

1952
01:24:17,474 --> 01:24:18,741
No, he's calling out
the big one.

1953
01:24:18,776 --> 01:24:19,744
No, no, no.

1954
01:24:21,077 --> 01:24:21,912
Come on!

1955
01:24:22,478 --> 01:24:23,614
Dylan!

1956
01:24:24,415 --> 01:24:26,083
Yes!

1957
01:24:26,116 --> 01:24:27,500
Dylan, what are you doing?

1958
01:24:27,535 --> 01:24:28,885
Did you see? Did you see?

1959
01:24:28,919 --> 01:24:30,287
I punched her in the face,
just like you taught me.

1960
01:24:30,321 --> 01:24:32,122
And then I kicked her
right in the nuts.

1961
01:24:32,156 --> 01:24:33,791
You like that, bitch?

1962
01:24:33,824 --> 01:24:35,759
You want some more, bitch?

1963
01:24:35,793 --> 01:24:38,128
Sweetheart, what happened?
What's going on here?

1964
01:24:38,161 --> 01:24:39,862
He punched me in the face.

1965
01:24:39,897 --> 01:24:41,665
Then he kicked me
in the swimsuit area.

1966
01:24:41,697 --> 01:24:43,366
Then he called me
the "B" word.

1967
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:45,068
Who did, him?

1968
01:24:45,102 --> 01:24:46,804
He did. I saw it. He said
they taught him to hit girls.

1969
01:24:46,836 --> 01:24:48,972
No, no. We thought
your daughter was a boy.

1970
01:24:49,005 --> 01:24:50,840
No, what he means is that

1971
01:24:50,874 --> 01:24:52,576
Dylan told us that a fourth
grader was picking on him,

1972
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:53,977
but he didn't tell us
it was a girl.

1973
01:24:54,010 --> 01:24:55,178
Yeah, and if you had,
we'd have told you

1974
01:24:55,211 --> 01:24:56,547
that it's never okay
to hit a girl.

1975
01:24:56,580 --> 01:24:57,648
And that she's probably
only bugging you

1976
01:24:57,681 --> 01:24:58,749
because she
likes you, buddy.

1977
01:24:58,781 --> 01:25:00,816
I do not like him.

1978
01:25:00,851 --> 01:25:02,318
I think she likes him.

1979
01:25:02,352 --> 01:25:04,187
Gross, whatever.

1980
01:25:04,220 --> 01:25:05,754
She totally does.

1981
01:25:05,789 --> 01:25:07,057
Are you calling
my daughter a whore?

1982
01:25:07,089 --> 01:25:08,791
They were implying it, Jerry.

1983
01:25:08,825 --> 01:25:10,260
Wait. That's quite
a stretch.

1984
01:25:10,294 --> 01:25:12,662
Mrs. Troy, please.
I got this.

1985
01:25:12,696 --> 01:25:14,231
Wait, first of all, which one
of you two is the kid's dad?

1986
01:25:14,697 --> 01:25:15,932
They both are.

1987
01:25:16,866 --> 01:25:19,669
My gosh. Wow!

1988
01:25:19,703 --> 01:25:23,406
I'm sorry. That's the first time
he's ever referred to me as Dad.

1989
01:25:23,441 --> 01:25:24,942
It's something I've wanted
to hear for a long time,

1990
01:25:24,975 --> 01:25:26,811
so it's a bit poignant.

1991
01:25:26,843 --> 01:25:29,545
I tend to cry a lot

1992
01:25:29,579 --> 01:25:32,850
when things get emotional.
They tease me all the time.

1993
01:25:32,883 --> 01:25:34,585
I'm actually the stepdad.

1994
01:25:34,618 --> 01:25:35,786
So you're
the real dad!

1995
01:25:36,987 --> 01:25:38,655
Hey. You don't want to
embarrass yourself, buddy.

1996
01:25:38,689 --> 01:25:40,757
You threatening me now,
tough guy?

1997
01:25:40,790 --> 01:25:41,891
He's threatening you, Jerry.

1998
01:25:41,926 --> 01:25:42,993
Nobody's threatening anybody.

1999
01:25:43,025 --> 01:25:44,661
But you're gonna want to
back that up, Jerry.

2000
01:25:44,695 --> 01:25:46,330
And you, Squidward tie.
Quit being an instigator,

2001
01:25:46,362 --> 01:25:47,798
or I'm gonna have to
rap you in the mouth.

2002
01:25:49,133 --> 01:25:51,235
Hey, hey, hey.
Everyone just calm down.

2003
01:25:51,267 --> 01:25:52,703
We're at the
Daddy-Daughter Dance.

2004
01:25:52,735 --> 01:25:54,437
You stay out of it, all right?
You don't count!

2005
01:25:54,471 --> 01:25:56,107
I want to talk to
the real dad here.

2006
01:25:56,140 --> 01:25:58,475
Hey, Brad here is more of
a real dad than any of us.

2007
01:25:58,508 --> 01:25:59,944
You ever want to see how you
should be raising your kids,

2008
01:25:59,976 --> 01:26:00,811
go look at this guy.

2009
01:26:01,777 --> 01:26:04,115
Here I go again.
What did I tell you?

2010
01:26:05,249 --> 01:26:08,185
Really? You mean that?

2011
01:26:08,186 --> 01:26:08,585
Yes, I do, Brad.

2012
01:26:08,620 --> 01:26:08,985
You're a great dad.

2013
01:26:12,655 --> 01:26:13,690
You shouldn't have
done that.

2014
01:26:13,723 --> 01:26:14,991
Yeah? Why?

2015
01:26:15,025 --> 01:26:17,027
I'm pretty sure he kills
people for a job.

2016
01:26:17,061 --> 01:26:18,596
He's been rather
vague with me,

2017
01:26:18,628 --> 01:26:20,564
but that's what
I'm kind of surmising.

2018
01:26:20,597 --> 01:26:22,166
-Are we gonna do this?
-We're gonna do it.

2019
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:22,984
Okay. You ready?

2020
01:26:23,019 --> 01:26:23,768
Yeah, I'm ready.

2021
01:26:23,801 --> 01:26:25,102
This is what you get.

2022
01:26:25,103 --> 01:26:25,137
Daddy.

2023
01:26:36,213 --> 01:26:37,115
Want another one?
Come on in.

2024
01:26:40,584 --> 01:26:41,685
What's going on?

2025
01:26:44,588 --> 01:26:46,123
Is this like some
UFC shit?

2026
01:26:46,155 --> 01:26:47,324
Come on, Brad.

2027
01:26:47,357 --> 01:26:48,491
That's right.
It's a dance, Jerry.

2028
01:26:48,525 --> 01:26:50,762
Yeah. So dance, Jerry!

2029
01:26:56,133 --> 01:26:59,369
Yeah! You just got
served, Jerry!

2030
01:26:59,402 --> 01:27:01,405
You just got
a piping hot serving.

2031
01:27:01,437 --> 01:27:04,341
I'm not getting served.
You're getting served!

2032
01:27:04,374 --> 01:27:07,178
You don't know this about me,
Jerry, but I like to move my body.

2033
01:27:09,079 --> 01:27:10,615
Get it, Brad!

2034
01:27:16,387 --> 01:27:17,655
Yeah! Yeah, Brad!

2035
01:27:21,959 --> 01:27:23,661
This is a dance!
Let's go!

2036
01:27:41,978 --> 01:27:43,647
Am I the only one
with my shirt off?

2037
01:27:46,016 --> 01:27:47,218
You know you can't
leave, right?

2038
01:27:48,051 --> 01:27:49,319
You want me to stay?

2039
01:27:49,351 --> 01:27:51,221
These guys are growing up so
fast. You don't want to miss it.

2040
01:27:53,089 --> 01:27:54,824
You're sweating profusely.

2041
01:27:54,859 --> 01:27:56,960
I know. I sweat a lot.

2042
01:27:56,961 --> 01:27:56,995
That's cool.

2043
01:27:59,129 --> 01:28:00,064
Thank you.

2044
01:28:33,230 --> 01:28:34,699
<i>So Dusty did stay.</i>

2045
01:28:35,699 --> 01:28:37,034
<i>And with the huge
amount of money</i>

2046
01:28:37,066 --> 01:28:39,102
<i>he was making as
the voice of The Panda,</i>

2047
01:28:39,136 --> 01:28:40,337
<i>he built his own
new castle</i>

2048
01:28:40,369 --> 01:28:41,705
<i>right down the street.</i>

2049
01:28:42,972 --> 01:28:45,241
Hey!

2050
01:28:45,275 --> 01:28:47,544
<i>But we kept Tumor because he didn't
get along with Dusty's new puppy.</i>

2051
01:28:50,247 --> 01:28:52,749
<i>It turns out Tumor
was only five...</i>

2052
01:28:52,783 --> 01:28:54,151
<i>...so we're going
to have him...</i>

2053
01:28:54,185 --> 01:28:55,852
<i>...for a long,
long time.</i>

2054
01:28:55,886 --> 01:28:56,910
Tumor!

2055
01:28:57,820 --> 01:28:59,657
<i>And I was more than
a little surprised</i>

2056
01:28:59,690 --> 01:29:02,359
<i>when Dusty showed up one day
with his new wife</i>

2057
01:29:03,293 --> 01:29:04,694
<i>and his new stepdaughter.</i>

2058
01:29:04,727 --> 01:29:06,497
This is my stepdaughter,
Adriana.

2059
01:29:06,529 --> 01:29:08,865
Hey, Adriana. I'm Brad.

2060
01:29:08,899 --> 01:29:10,501
That's your brother and sister.
You guys play nice, okay?

2061
01:29:10,534 --> 01:29:12,002
Hey, hon.
Who's at the door?

2062
01:29:12,035 --> 01:29:13,770
Hey, Sara.
This is my wife, Karen.

2063
01:29:13,805 --> 01:29:16,140
Is it...
Your wife?

2064
01:29:16,173 --> 01:29:19,476
<i>That Karen, wow,
she is so great.</i>

2065
01:29:19,510 --> 01:29:21,512
<i>It turns out she's</i>

2066
01:29:21,544 --> 01:29:24,515
<i>a doctor and a celebrated
novelist. I mean...</i>

2067
01:29:25,181 --> 01:29:27,050
Hon, would you...

2068
01:29:27,083 --> 01:29:31,154
Come here, Griff.
Come here, Griff.!

2069
01:29:31,187 --> 01:29:33,858
<i>And I was so surprised when I
found out that we're the same age.</i>

2070
01:29:35,325 --> 01:29:36,994
<i>I mean, she looks
so young, right?</i>

2071
01:29:37,861 --> 01:29:39,195
<i>Good for her!</i>

2072
01:29:39,230 --> 01:29:41,265
Honey, you look
amazing tonight.

2073
01:29:41,297 --> 01:29:42,765
What are you
talking about?

2074
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:45,136
It's just my normal clothes.
That's how I look.

2075
01:29:45,168 --> 01:29:46,503
I just got ready
really fast.

2076
01:29:47,270 --> 01:29:49,239
Hey, Griff.
Hey, little Griffy.

2077
01:29:49,273 --> 01:29:50,774
You want to come
to Daddy?

2078
01:29:50,807 --> 01:29:52,443
What, you think I'm going to
pick his pockets or something?

2079
01:29:52,475 --> 01:29:54,211
He doesn't carry
a wallet.

2080
01:29:54,244 --> 01:29:55,779
Sweetie, be careful
with that knife, okay?

2081
01:29:55,812 --> 01:29:56,614
You're not my dad.

2082
01:29:57,914 --> 01:29:58,983
<i>Brad was right.</i>

2083
01:29:59,016 --> 01:30:00,851
<i>Being a stepdad
isn't always easy.</i>

2084
01:30:00,883 --> 01:30:03,354
<i>But he was also right
that it's worth it.</i>

2085
01:30:03,386 --> 01:30:05,421
<i>And he was right about
the Ford Flex, too.</i>

2086
01:30:05,454 --> 01:30:07,390
<i>It's a great family car.</i>

2087
01:30:07,425 --> 01:30:10,528
<i>Got plenty of room for the kids,
gear, and plenty of pickup for me.</i>

2088
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:12,229
<i>I got the Weekender
package.</i>

2089
01:30:12,262 --> 01:30:14,231
<i>A few more bells and
whistles than Brad's,</i>

2090
01:30:14,265 --> 01:30:15,999
<i>but Brad doesn't
need to know that.</i>

2091
01:30:17,068 --> 01:30:17,901
Daddy!

2092
01:30:20,637 --> 01:30:22,039
Sweetie, I've been
waiting for you to...

2093
01:30:41,225 --> 01:30:43,428
Did you just gulp?

2094
01:30:43,429 --> 01:30:43,463
No.

2095
01:30:43,860 --> 01:30:45,261
I heard a gulp.

2096
01:30:45,296 --> 01:30:46,631
Well, a little bit, maybe.

2097
01:30:46,663 --> 01:30:48,264
There you are.

2098
01:30:48,298 --> 01:30:49,932
He's a lot
bigger than you.

2099
01:30:49,967 --> 01:30:52,469
He's got
legs for arms.

2100
01:30:52,502 --> 01:30:54,372
Little star,
guess what?

2101
01:30:54,404 --> 01:30:56,372
I like him.
I like him a lot.

2102
01:30:56,405 --> 01:30:58,809
Yeah. I bet you he's
going to like us, too.

2103
01:30:58,842 --> 01:31:01,345
Remember, Loving Fence.
Just go say hi.

2104
01:31:01,378 --> 01:31:03,715
Yeah, look, I got this,
buddy. Watch.

2105
01:31:04,347 --> 01:31:06,717
-Hey. You must be Roger.
-Nope.
