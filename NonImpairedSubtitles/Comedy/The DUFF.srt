00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:03,005
Ha, ha. Come on, please.
It's important.

1083
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:04,889
- What do you want?
BIANCA: Let's go.

1084
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,168
- Okay.
- Ugh.

1085
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:10,124
- So you asked him out?
BIANCA: Yeah.

1086
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:11,361
- That's awesome.
- Yeah.

1087
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,329
What's the problem?

1088
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:18,128
If you must know, I've never been
on an actual date before.

1089
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:21,847
Okay, okay. Sit down, sit down.

1090
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,128
We got this. Come here. All right.

1091
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:31,286
Step seven: the date.
Okay, we need a plan.

1092
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,920
You think a football team runs
on the field without a strategy?

1093
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:35,451
Eh... Mm.

1094
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:38,524
- Exactly, no. Of course they don't.
- No, of course they don't.

1095
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:41,650
You want this date to end with you
making out, you need to think ahead.

1096
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:44,644
So give me the vibe of the restaurant
you're going for.

1097
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,848
Okay, I'm thinking something
kind of trendy,

1098
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,128
you know, kind of hipster,
maybe unique?

1099
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,601
- Done. Dave & Buster's.
- Huh?

1100
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:55,009
- The place with the metal claw game?
- You bet your ass.

1101
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:58,927
WESLEY:
<i>Okay, you, Toby. Let's get started.</i>

1102
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:03,003
<i>Worst scenario is if you get seated at
a table right across from each other.</i>

1103
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:06,528
<i>Okay, no one's making out if they're
three feet apart. Simple geology.</i>

1104
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:08,682
You need a booth, okay?
It's better for flirting,

1105
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:12,890
not-so-accidental touching,
making out. Game on.

1106
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:16,283
Wow, I had no idea guys like you
even thought about this kind of stuff.

1107
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:19,887
Well, that's because you're racist
against jocks. You're a jock-cist.

1108
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:21,851
Okay, moving on.

1109
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:24,247
Okay, so how do you
set the tone at dinner?

1110
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:28,924
<i>Lighting matters, okay?
The darker the booth, the better.</i>

1111
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:32,564
Lighting, dark booth.
Got it. What's next?

1112
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:33,841
Body language.

1113
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,927
<i>Is he leaning in?</i>

1114
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,721
<i>- Is he sitting close?</i>
- I <i>don't know...</i>

1115
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:41,609
WESLEY:
<i>And then it's all about interaction.</i>

1116
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:44,730
<i>Is he trying to impress you?</i>

1117
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:48,010
<i>Does he say complimentary things
to you?</i>

1118
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:50,891
<i>If yes, chances are
he's gonna make his move.</i>

1119
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:53,168
<i>And touchdown.</i>

1120
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:54,407
Wes.

1121
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:56,562
I always wanted to do that
to the coach's board.

1122
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,688
It's big because it's on a chalkboard.

1123
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:01,241
We gotta go. Come on.
Let's go, let's go.

1124
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:05,767
Hey, DUFF queen, wanna show me
some of them moves?

1125
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:07,166
Shh.

1126
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,450
ARTHUR: Bianca?
BIANCA: Yes.

1127
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,921
The video was hysterical. Eat a dick.

1128
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:15,970
Thanks. I just had a bagel,
though, so I'm full.

1129
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:18,805
Mr. Arthur, I'm really sorry. I...

1130
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,440
ARTHUR: No, don't worry about it.
Step into my hallway.

1131
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:25,087
I don't play favorites,
but you're my favorite.

1132
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:29,767
You ever heard the phrase
"The pen is mightier than the sword"?

1133
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,763
Yeah, and in this case,

1134
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,969
a bunch of kids anonymously typing
whatever comments they want

1135
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:36,645
feels like an atomic bomb,

1136
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:39,770
and that's definitely mightier
than a sword.

1137
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:43,561
So make your writing
have a positive effect.

1138
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:46,530
As in a certain homecoming article
that's due.

1139
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:49,047
Oh, please, Mr. Arthur,

1140
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,601
the last thing I wanna do
is go to a place

1141
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,922
where everybody hates me
and then write about it.

1142
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:55,969
I picked you for a reason.

1143
00:58:56,120 --> 00:59:00,091
And whatever you write, I'm running it
as our lead, so make it count.

1144
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:04,848
Inspire us. Remember,
the pen is mightier than the sword.

1145

1146
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:08,330
Simon, get your finger out of there.

1147
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:09,601
SIMON:
You're not my father.

1148
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,250
ARTHUR:
Yes, I am your daddy, Simon.

MAN: What do you want me to say?
I have nothing to say.

WOMAN: I do everything around
this house, and you don't do...

1151
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,927
MAN: Oh, here we go.
WOMAN: Well, it's the truth.

1152
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:24,520
MAN:
Wesley, will you get the door?!

1153

WOMAN: Oh, don't yell at him.
He has nothing to do with this.

MAN:
Save it for therapy, okay, honey?

1155
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:32,727
- Wesley, get the door!
WESLEY: Okay, enough, I got it.

1156
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:34,729
Hey, ready to go get down

1157
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:38,402
- with some bro-valent electrons?
- Yeah.

1158
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:49,408
- Do you wanna talk about it?
- I'd like to not talk.

1159
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:52,649
Hmm. Well, I know just the place.

1160
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:59,366
WESLEY: You see why I need
that scholarship?

1161
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:04,683
WESLEY:
Hey, B, where the hell are we going?

1162
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:07,161
My special place. You'll see.

1163
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:09,846
- Is this where you kill me?
- Ha, ha. Yes.

1164
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:11,963
They're never gonna find you
out here.

1165
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,411
Aha.

1166
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:19,609
I give you Think Rock.

1167
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,168
- Huh?
- Wow. Um...

1168
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:24,890
What happens here?

1169
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:30,365
Well, it's gonna blow your mind,
but sit on the rock.

1170
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,050
- Unh.
- Good, good.

1171
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:35,568
And then you think.

1172
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:37,725
Try it.

1173
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:44,683
How'd you find this place?

1174
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:47,161
I used to run up here a lot
with Pepper,

1175
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:51,405
and she would always make
a direct beeline to this rock.

1176
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:53,369
I remember Pepper.

1177
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:55,324
How's she doing?

1178
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,923
I guess she's okay.

1179
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:01,323
When my parents got divorced,
my mom wanted custody of me,

1180
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:04,450
and my dad wanted custody
of the dog.

1181
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:05,806
- Wow.
- Yeah, so I think that

1182
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:08,770
pretty much sums it up right there.

1183
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:16,645
Are your...?

1184
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:21,003
- Are your parents gonna get divorced?
- God, I hope so.

1185
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:23,686
I just... I...

1186
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:27,444
It's okay.

1187
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:30,004
It's not okay.

1188
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:32,764
But it will be.

1189
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:34,407
I promise.

1190
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:49,002
I'm... I'm sorry, I didn't...

1191
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:51,686
Oh. No, I... It's okay, I...

1192
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:53,968
- What, um...? Were you...?
- That... You know what?

1193
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:58,011
That was... Uh, that was practice.

1194
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:00,129
Sorry, practice for...?

1195
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:03,045
For step eight, okay, for...
Of the plan.

1196
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:07,728
That was practice in case you hadn't
made out with anyone in a while.

1197
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:09,566
Huh.

1198
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:11,529
It's all part of the plan?

1199
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:15,526
It's just practice, just a guerrilla-style
practice session?

1200
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:18,126
- Sneak attack.
- Hm, hm.

1201
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:19,930
Really?

1202
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:22,402
Mm-hm, okay.

1203
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:27,046
Is that what it felt like?

1204
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:31,649
That I hadn't made out with anyone
in a while or whatever?

1205
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:35,725
Well, I mean,
I'm more of a tongue guy myself, but...

1206
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:39,407
You don't say?
I think I felt it poking out my butthole.

1207
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:42,962
- Ha-ha-ha.
- So far down my throat. Ha, ha.

1208
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:45,441
Are you giving me kissing advice?

1209
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:47,605
Man, I guess I am.

1210
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:50,001
- B.
- You need it.

1211
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:51,606
That's how people kiss.

1212
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:55,247
Uh, in porn, maybe.

1213
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:56,606
What's wrong with porn?

1214
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:58,410
If this was a porn movie,

1215
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:00,720
we wouldn't be sitting on a rock
having a conversation.

1216
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:03,201
You know,
you'd be bringing me a pizza

1217
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:06,887
or, um, you know, cleaning my pool.

1218
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:09,327
How old is the porn
you're watching?

1219
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:11,960
That doesn't... That's not...
That's not even a thing anymore.

1220
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:14,691
- They don't do that?
- Ha, ha.

1221
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:16,569
All right, you know what?

1222
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,729
I'm gonna give you a lesson.

1223
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:21,406
It's gonna be free.
The first one's always free.

1224
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:23,688
All right,
this is how girls like to be kissed.

1225
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:26,081
- We're doing this?
- We're doing this.

1226
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:29,408
- Close your eyes. Ha, ha.
- Heh.

1227
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:32,370
- Ready.
- Okay, okay. Lean in.

1228
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:36,650
Hey-oh. Go slow, okay?
Let the tension build.

1229
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:38,401
So much to learn.

1230
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:41,404
- Okay, ready?
- No.
