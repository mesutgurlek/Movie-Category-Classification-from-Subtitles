1
00:00:43,676 --> 00:00:44,711
<i>Okay, welcome back.</i>

2
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:47,357
<i>This is Artie Decker,
De Voice of the Fresno Grizzlies...</i>

3
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,322
<i>and we've got a good one, my friends.</i>

4
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:52,697
<i>Top of the ninth here at Chukchansi
Park, and a beautiful night.</i>

5
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:55,164
<i>We can actually feel
that fall is finally an its way.</i>

6
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:59,201
<i>It's a rather crisp 107 degrees, but dry.</i>

7
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:02,669
<i>We've got 15,000 sweaty and bloated
people all pumped up on Churros...</i>

8
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:04,967
<i>rooting on our Fresno Grizzlies.</i>

9
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:08,476
<i>And Brad, this is why I love
announcing Minor League Baseball...</i>

10
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:10,909
<i>because I get to say names
like "River Cats..."</i>

11
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:12,845
<i>or the "Rancho Cucamonga Quakes."</i>

12
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:14,950
<i>I don't have to ever say boring names</i>

13
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:17,146
<i>like "Tigers," or "Red Sox," or "Cubs."</i>

14
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,246
<i>Okay, we got a little break in the action...</i>

15
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:21,426
<i>as they're having
a little meeting on the mound.</i>

16
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:23,651
<i>Artie, do you know what time it is?</i>

17
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:28,697
<i>I sure do, Brad.
It's time for Artie's Kiss Cam!</i>

18
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,631
<i>Thank you, Gwen.</i>

19
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:34,271
<i>Let's see what kind of young lovers</i>

20
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,737
<i>we got at the ballpark tonight.</i>

21
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,237
<i>All right, there's a kiss.</i>

22
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,909
<i>Well, you know one thing when you see</i>

23
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:40,909
<i>a kiss like that, they're married.</i>

24
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,012
<i>Wait, wait, we've got a proposal.</i>

25
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:45,843
<i>"Will you marry me, Clara? Love, Nate."</i>

26
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:49,509
<i>There's our young Romeo now.
And whoa! He has scored!</i>

27
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:51,985
<i>Brad, that is what
you young people would call a "hotties."</i>

28
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:55,025
<i>He's got Britney Spears
and he's about to give her the ring...</i>

29
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:57,024
<i>and he goes the other way!</i>

30
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:59,322
<i>I can't believe what I am seeing...</i>

31
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,989
<i>and I'm sure she's
got a great "personality," but, oh my.</i>

32
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,996
<i>I thought Jerry Garcia was dead.</i>

33
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:07,535
<i>What's he doing
in the stands marrying him?</i>

34
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:11,470
<i>Here at Chukchansi Park,
love is blind, and apparently so is Nate.</i>

35
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:13,769
<i>All right, let's get back to the action</i>

36
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:16,072
<i>as the meeting breaks up on the mound.</i>

37
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:18,840
<i>Here's the situation.
First and third, two outs.</i>

38
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:20,750
<i>And here '5 the pitch</i>

39
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,681
<i>Swing and a miss. Diaz fires down to third.</i>

40
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:23,684
<i>They've picked him off third!</i>

41
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:26,153
<i>- You're out!
- Ballgame aver!</i>

42
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:28,383
<i>I'll tell you, Myers is getting an earful...</i>

43
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:31,653
<i>and as my mom used to say,
"There's no cure for dumb."</i>

44
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:34,195
<i>Gwen! We won.</i>

45
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:36,367
<i>And that closes out
the last game of the season.</i>

46
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:39,002
<i>The Grizzlies take
the Sacramento River Cats...</i>

47
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:40,603
<i>by a score of three to one.</i>

48
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:43,205
<i>We'll be right back with a happy recap.</i>

49
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,370
<i>That is a bad way to end a game.</i>

50
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:49,206
<i>Artie. Mr. Decker.</i>

51
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:54,850
<i>I want to say thank you
for what has been an awesome semester.</i>

52
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:59,353
<i>I mean, you taught me a lot,
and... I got you this.</i>

53
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:00,524
<i>What did you do, Brad?</i>

54
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:03,091
<i>It's got all the famous calls
you told me about.</i>

55
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:05,889
<i>Harwell, "Red" Barber, Scully, Russ Hodges.</i>

56
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:08,224
<i>You know, that's really great,
Brad. Thank you so much.</i>

57
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:11,033
<i>Well, as the great Yogi Berra once said,</i>

58
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,602
<i>"It isn’t over till it's over."</i>

59
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:14,931
<i>Well, this Fresno Grizzlies season is over.</i>

60
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:18,132
<i>I'm Artie Decker,
De Voice of the Fresno Grizzlies.</i>

61
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:21,471
<i>So, on behalf of Brad Zolick
and the late Gwen Foster on the organ...</i>

62
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:25,616
<i>good night everybody,
thanks for listening and lights out, Alice.</i>

63
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,742
<i>I love this job.</i>

64
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,050
<i>I'm fired?</i>

65
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:34,919
<i>I'm sorry, Artie. I'm changing everything.</i>

66
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:37,958
<i>New logos, new uniforms, new music.</i>

67
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:39,755
<i>All the deadwood is floating to the sawmill.</i>

68
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:40,897
<i>I'm deadwood?</i>

69
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:43,399
<i>You're old school.
You reminisce and you tell stories.</i>

70
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,297
<i>All our sponsors are for hearing aids,</i>

71
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,165
<i>beds that go up and down, and scooters.</i>

72
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,340
<i>Not the cool kind, the sad kind.</i>

73
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:50,967
<i>We need someone who's wired in.</i>

74
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:51,835
<i>To what?</i>

75
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:53,169
<i>Face book.</i>

76
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:54,902
<i>- How many friends do you have?
- I don't have any friends.</i>

77
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:56,136
<i>- Have you made any posts?
- No.</i>

78
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:57,610
<i>- What was your last update?
- My what?</i>

79
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:59,147
<i>- Have you poked anybody?
- I haven't poked anybody!</i>

80
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:00,613
<i>- Has anybody poked you?
- No.</i>

81
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:02,787
<i>The thing is Artie,
even if you were connected...</i>

82
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:04,614
<i>I don't know that I'd want
to be poked by you.</i>

83
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:06,154
<i>- How many apps do you have?
- I don't have any apps.</i>

84
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:07,324
<i>- You don't have any apps?
- No.</i>

85
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:08,583
<i>- Everyone has apps.
- I don't have an app.</i>

86
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:09,919
<i>- Do you play Angry Birds?
- Angry Birds?</i>

87
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:10,994
<i>Who's your favourite Angry Bird?</i>

88
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,085
<i>I don't have a favourite Angry Bird!</i>

89
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:13,163
<i>Everyone has a favourite Angry Bird.</i>

90
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,391
<i>I don't have a favourite Angry Bird!</i>

91
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:15,758
<i>Hash tag.</i>

92
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:17,332
<i>When was the last time you hash tagged?</i>

93
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:19,264
<i>Are you out of your mind?
What the heck are you talking about?</i>

94
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,437
<i>We need announcers that tweet.</i>

95
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:22,300
<i>I'll tweet.
I'll make whatever noise you want.</i>

96
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:25,669
<i>Sorry, Artie, my mind's made up.</i>

97
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,676
<i>Feel the burn, everyone.</i>

98
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:05,076
<i>And one, two, three, four.</i>

99
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:06,045
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

100
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:07,579
<i>How are we doing, Diane?</i>

101
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:09,811
<i>Oh, my sciatica.</i>

102
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:11,420
<i>My other sciatica.</i>

103
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:18,091
<i>Ten minutes to cheesecake, ladies.</i>

104
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:20,658
<i>There we go. Good job.</i>

105
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:22,355
<i>Hi, Artie.</i>

106
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:24,228
<i>Hi, ladies.</i>

107
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:25,562
<i>Caught the end of the game.</i>

108
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:28,535
<i>"No cure for dumb." Funny.</i>

109
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:30,605
<i>- Yeah.
- Funny.</i>

110
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,499
<i>Don't fall, hon.</i>

111
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,179
<i>I got it.</i>

112
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:37,577
<i>All right, everybody,
pull your core in.</i>

113
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:39,675
<i>I don't have a core.</i>

114
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:41,510
<i>Work those abs.</i>

115
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:48,489
<i>You know, Artie,
this could turn out to be a good thing.</i>

116
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,388
<i>It could give us more "us" time.</i>

117
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:53,928
<i>You mean me wearing a captain's
hat following you around Costco?</i>

118
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,158
<i>You don't want to retire? Fine.</i>

119
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:59,360
<i>You were offered a job
teaching broadcasting at Fresno State.</i>

120
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:00,833
<i>You could teach young people.</i>

121
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,734
<i>I could,
but why should they know what I know?</i>

122
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:05,170
<i>Ever the nurturer.</i>

123
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,369
<i>I don't want to teach,
I want to do. I still have the dream.</i>

124
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:09,410
<i>The Giants?</i>

125
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:12,606
<i>Yeah, the Giants.
I've been chasing this job for 35 years.</i>

126
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:14,615
<i>You give up your dream, you give up.</i>

127
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:15,852
<i>I'm not quitting.</i>

128
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,612
<i>I feel 10 years younger than I am,</i>

129
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:19,347
<i>and I look 10 years younger than that.</i>

130
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:22,355
<i>So basically, you're asking
a 38-year-old to retire.</i>

131
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,459
<i>You're 38? Paint the house.</i>

132
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:28,928
<i>Artie, to me, you're the best
announcer in the whole world.</i>

133
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:31,398
<i>You should be broadcasting for the Giants.</i>

134
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:33,798
<i>But after all these years, honey...</i>

135
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:36,064
<i>something tells me
they don't have you on speed dial.</i>

136
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:37,902
<i>Mmm.</i>

137
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:42,239
<i>- It'll be okay.
-l'm sorry.</i>

138
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:50,146
<i>H-life awake.</i>

139
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:54,291
<i>Garage activated. Vehicle charging.</i>

140
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,926
<i>Solar panels activated.</i>

141
00:06:57,116 --> 00:07:00,791
<i>Good morning, Harper, Turner and Barker.</i>

142
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:02,398
<i>-- Waffles ready.</i>

143
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:04,624
<i>Coffee ready.</i>

144
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,438
<i>Time for breakfast.</i>

145
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:09,163
<i>But-but, Mom.</i>

146
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:11,740
<i>Honey, hold on one second. Uh-huh.</i>

147
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:15,779
<i>Well, I can have that up for
you in about three hours.</i>

148
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:20,106
<i>Yeah, one hour,
that's what I meant. Sure, I can hold on.</i>

149
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:21,114
<i>Stupid!</i>

150
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:23,253
<i>- What's the matter, honey?
- I missed a note.</i>

151
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,184
<i>Come and have breakfast.
You're going to get it.</i>

152
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:26,584
<i>You know that you always do.</i>

153
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:27,985
<i>Yeah, I'm right here.</i>

154
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:30,525
<i>Right. And when would that be?</i>

155
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:32,696
<i>That's so soon. You got to be kidding me.</i>

156
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:34,023
<i>Dad! Dad.</i>

157
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,530
<i>I'm the soy sages,
Turner gets the Wheatie-O's.</i>

158
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:39,328
<i>Okay. Hey, babe, can you take over here?</i>

159
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:40,629
<i>- I'm on a call.
-l'm on a call.</i>

160
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:42,329
<i>Thank you.</i>

161
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:47,801
<i>But-but M-Mom! Th-The other
k-kids are going to w-watch them.</i>

162
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,346
<i>Honey, I don't think you'd
really enjoy the Saw movies.</i>

163
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:52,641
<i>Remember when we went to see Avatar...</i>

164
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,011
<i>and you spent the last two hours</i>

165
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:55,345
<i>with your head inside my purse?</i>

166
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,714
<i>L-I-l was I-looking for the gum.</i>

167
00:07:58,177 --> 00:07:59,281
<i>I'm right here.</i>

168
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,650
<i>I can't believe it.
My computer just crashed.</i>

169
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,317
<i>I'll have to call you right back.</i>

170
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:07,464
<i>Barker, can we discuss
some of the many other possibilities...</i>

171
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:10,862
<i>for today's wardrobe,
including some involving pants?</i>

172
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:12,559
<i>Honey, can I talk to you outside
for a second?</i>

173
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:15,906
<i>Sure. I have nothing but time.</i>

174
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:20,138
<i>D-Dad? C-Can I watch the Saw movies?</i>

175
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,141
<i>Sure.</i>

176
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,041
<i>Yeah!</i>

177
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:26,012
<i>Wait. That's way inappropriate.</i>

178
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:27,140
<i>Aw!</i>

179
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:29,715
<i>What's up?</i>

180
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:33,913
<i>Oh.</i>

181
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,686
<i>That was nice. Like a little mini date.</i>

182
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:36,860
<i>Crazy year, right?</i>

183
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,689
<i>I mean, the whole thing.
Moving to Atlanta for my job.</i>

184
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:41,490
<i>Yeah, it's had its challenges.</i>

185
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,928
<i>Well, guess what.
That was my boss on the phone...</i>

186
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:45,727
<i>and the H-life has been nominated</i>

187
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:48,203
<i>- for "Best New Product of the Year."</i>

188
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:50,569
<i>Oh!</i>

189
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,175
<i>That's fantastic!</i>

190
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,845
<i>I know! They're flying us both next week.</i>

191
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:58,447
<i>Five days of lectures
and networking and love.</i>

192
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:00,573
<i>Oh. Saturday is Harper's audition.</i>

193
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:01,751
<i>Yeah, but it's at night.</i>

194
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,215
<i>We'll fly back early. We'll make it.</i>

195
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:04,717
<i>Also, Turner has speech therapy.</i>

196
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:06,322
<i>I have to buy Harper a dress for the audition.</i>

197
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:07,923
<i>We're supposed
to take the kids to the symphony--</i>

198
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:10,754
<i>Honey, we haven't had a
vacation since Barker was born.</i>

199
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,055
<i>- That's five years.
- Mmm-hmm.</i>

200
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:15,826
<i>This conversation is the longest we've been
alone in months.</i>

201
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:18,593
<i>So, great.
I'll call my parents, they'll fly down.</i>

202
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,294
<i>They'll be happy
to watch the kids while we're gone.</i>

203
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:28,476
<i>A cruise. What cruise?</i>

204
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:31,342
<i>The one that we bought them
for their 40th anniversary.</i>

205
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:33,744
<i>I said just get them matching tracksuits.</i>

206
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,682
<i>Look, we'll figure something out, okay?</i>

207
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:41,113
<i>Well, we could always call your parents.</i>

208
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,265
<i>Oh, you're serious.</i>

209
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:52,664
<i>Yeah. They haven't seen the kids
in what, a year?</i>

210
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:56,463
<i>Ten months is not quite a year.</i>

211
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:57,971
<i>Call them.</i>

212
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:06,314
<i>- They're not coming.
- Don't you need to talk to them first?</i>

213
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:09,384
<i>You know that they're just going to
say that they can't make it.</i>

214
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:11,314
<i>What? What?</i>

215
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:13,382
<i>- What?
- The itch.</i>

216
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:16,150
<i>You're kidding.
You're getting your "Artie and Diane Rash"?</i>

217
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:19,455
<i>Have you forgotten how they disapprove
of the way that we parent?</i>

218
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:23,896
<i>My father doesn't listen.
My mother, she's a tornado with lipstick.</i>

219
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:27,063
<i>Alice, we need this vacation.</i>

220
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:28,329
<i>And as you know...</i>

221
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:33,171
<i>who's going to be with you
in the Hilton Head?</i>

222
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:35,377
<i>Nigel?</i>

223
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:36,546
<i>That's right.</i>

224
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:40,514
<i>In fact, have you heard me new song?</i>

225
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:45,680
<i>I'm going to love you
till the police come</i>

226
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:50,086
<i>Anything for you, Nigel.</i>

227
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:54,528
<i>Carl flushed my pillow down the toilet.</i>

228
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,394
<i>Toilet over? Owing.
Bathroom ?ooded.</i>

229
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,264
<i>Okay, I'll call my parents.</i>

230
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,638
<i>Artie, pick up the phone!</i>

231
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:11,972
<i>What are you doing?</i>

232
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,481
<i>I can't hear you, the phone's ringing.</i>

233
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:16,586
<i>- Hello?
- Hi, Dad.</i>

234
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:18,551
<i>- Alice, how are you?
-ls Mom around?</i>

235
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:20,724
<i>Yeah, hold on, I'll get her.</i>

236
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:21,789
<i>Your daughter.</i>

237
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:22,891
<i>Put her on speakerphone.</i>

238
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:24,891
<i>Don't tell her I was fired.</i>

239
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,931
<i>- Oh, my.
- I got it.</i>

240
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:30,259
<i>- Put her on hold.
- I know.</i>

241
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:31,400
<i>- Put her on hold.
-l'm trying.</i>

242
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,500
<i>- Put her on hold.
- I can't.</i>

243
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,137
<i>- Put her on hold.
- You're making me tense.</i>

244
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:35,361
<i>Now, put her on hold.</i>

245
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,598
<i>It's right there.</i>

246
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:38,173
<i>I'm going to start a fire, here.</i>

247
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:40,604
<i>Hi, Alice, what's going on?</i>

248
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,271
<i>Well, now that you ask...</i>

249
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:49,817
<i>Phil has to go away
next week and I'd really like to go with him.</i>

250
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:51,784
<i>And we need someone to watch the kids,</i>

251
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:53,719
<i>so I was wandering, would you want ta?</i>

252
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:55,392
<i>No. No.</i>

253
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:57,159
<i>We'd love to!</i>

254
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:58,894
<i>Listen, I'm cooking dinner.</i>

255
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:01,622
<i>I'll call you back in a little bit for the details.</i>

256
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:03,556
<i>She said yes.</i>

257
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:04,666
<i>You said yes.</i>

258
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:06,894
<i>Artie, we practically
never see our grandchildren.</i>

259
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:08,163
<i>We've never seen their new house.</i>

260
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,668
<i>They've never been to Fresno.</i>

261
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:11,466
<i>I just got fired. I'm licking my wounds.</i>

262
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,075
<i>I'll lick them. Come on!</i>

263
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:14,676
<i>They need someone to take care of the kids.</i>

264
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:16,210
<i>Can't the house do it?</i>

265
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,571
<i>We have one child.</i>

266
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:22,218
<i>These three kids are the only
grandchildren we're ever going to have.</i>

267
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,822
<i>I'm awkward around those kids.
I don't think they like me.</i>

268
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:29,724
<i>Honey, they don't see you enough.</i>

269
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,418
<i>They have to know you better
before they don't like you.</i>

270
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,865
<i>No, but it's a real thing, Di.
And it all comes from Alice.</i>

271
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:37,591
<i>Like the last time,
the little one left the house...</i>

272
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:38,928
<i>wearing flippers and a bathrobe.</i>

273
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:42,538
<i>Sol made a little joke.
I said, "This one, any hope for normal?"</i>

274
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:45,004
<i>And I got this withering gaze.</i>

275
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:46,369
<i>Like you're giving me now.</i>

276
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:48,545
<i>Well, first of all...</i>

277
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:51,738
<i>it might be a good thing
if you learned "the little one's" name.</i>

278
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:52,938
<i>It's Barker.</i>

279
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,587
<i>Di.</i>

280
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:01,290
<i>Listen to me, I'm fragile right now.</i>

281
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,550
<i>I need a job.</i>

282
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:05,285
<i>I don't need Alice's disapproval.
I'm not going.</i>

283
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:07,589
<i>- You're going.
- That's what I meant.</i>

284
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,596
<i>Her whole way of raising
her kids is a giant...</i>

285
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,397
<i>...in our face.</i>

286
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:16,198
<i>It's her generation. It's just their way.</i>

287
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:19,269
<i>Hey, what are you looking for, sailor?</i>

288
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,412
<i>If you haven't found
it yet, it's not there. I'll help you out.</i>

289
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:27,612
<i>- Come on!
- He's not done groping.</i>

290
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:31,482
<i>And could she
have found anyone less like me to marry?</i>

291
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,719
<i>What's your
problem with Phil? He's such a sweet guy.</i>

292
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:37,417
<i>He is sweet. I think he breastfed the kids.</i>

293
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:39,391
<i>Perfect, it's raining.</i>

294
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:41,656
<i>Scattered showers, honey.
It'll be over in 20 minutes.</i>

295
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:42,832
<i>It's an omen.</i>

296
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:44,968
<i>- What's it an omen of?
- Impending doom.</i>

297
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,932
<i>- I have a great idea.
- What's that?</i>

298
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:47,968
<i>Shut up!</i>

299
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,768
<i>I'll think about it.</i>

300
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,810
<i>- You know what grand parenting is?
- What?</i>

301
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,136
<i>A second chance.</i>

302
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:58,279
<i>That's pretty good.</i>

303
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,972
<i>- And you know what Alice told me?
- What?</i>

304
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:03,312
<i>The kids are over-the-moon excited
about our coming.</i>

305
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,419
<i>Why them?</i>

306
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,453
<i>Because they're your grandparents
and they love you.</i>

307
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:08,647
<i>D-Do we have to wear these?</i>

308
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:13,425
<i>Well, Grandma made them.
And she thinks you like them.</i>

309
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:15,298
<i>Why would she think that?</i>

310
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,766
<i>Because I told her that you did.</i>

311
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:21,370
<i>Look, it's going to be okay. I promise you.</i>

312
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,301
<i>You know, they're very funny.</i>

313
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,805
<i>Grandpa tells lots of jokes...</i>

314
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,669
<i>that you won't get.</i>

315
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,647
<i>So just laugh.</i>

316
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:34,716
<i>Just laugh and I promise you
we'll get through this week.</i>

317
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,380
<i>Remember, Mama loves you very much.</i>

318
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:43,020
<i>They're here!</i>

319
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:47,061
<i>Oh, no.</i>

320
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,229
<i>Hi!</i>

321
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:54,335
<i>Hi!</i>

322
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:55,732
<i>This is a McStadium.</i>

323
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:57,464
<i>Hey, thanks for coming.</i>

324
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:58,471
<i>Hello, Phil.</i>

325
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:01,338
<i>Oh, my goodness!
They're wearing their shirts.</i>

326
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:03,809
<i>I told you, they love those shirts!</i>

327
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:05,380
<i>Give me a kiss.</i>

328
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,852
<i>I'm so excited.</i>

329
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:12,044
<i>This one's going to be prettier
than her grandma.</i>

330
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,655
<i>- Harper.
- I know.</i>

331
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,826
<i>- How's the fiddle coming? Still fiddling?
- Mmm-hmm.</i>

332
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:17,353
<i>Hello, boys, still single?</i>

333
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:22,657
<i>Mom, you brought groceries?</i>

334
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:23,799
<i>You know Dad.</i>

335
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:26,128
<i>He just wanted to make sure
you had food here for him.</i>

336
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:28,498
<i>Okay, and toilet paper?</i>

337
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:31,368
<i>Well, I know what I like. Aloe.</i>

338
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,138
<i>Are those for us?</i>

339
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,869
<i>Those are definitely for you!</i>

340
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:38,014
<i>Yep. One for each of you.</i>

341
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:39,910
<i>Here you go. And for you.</i>

342
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,551
<i>S-Super Squirters! Awesome!</i>

343
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:43,651
<i>You bought them guns.</i>

344
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:44,752
<i>Yeah.</i>

345
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,857
<i>Dad. We don't do guns.</i>

346
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,323
<i>Hey, if you think
that's something, wait until you see this.</i>

347
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:53,588
<i>This is classic Artie.</i>

348
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:58,364
<i>Artie Decker bobble heads.</i>

349
00:15:58,557 --> 00:15:59,763
<i>Here you go. Look at this, huh?</i>

350
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,063
<i>What do you say?</i>

351
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,501
<i>That's creepy. Make it stop!</i>

352
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:06,267
<i>Thank you, Grandpa.</i>

353
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,773
<i>Th-Thank you, G-Grandpa.</i>

354
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,675
<i>Hey, you know what?
Since we're all going to be pals now...</i>

355
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:14,544
<i>instead of calling me
"Grandpa," why don't you call me "Artie"?</i>

356
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,744
<i>So it's "Grandma and Artie"
now? What are you, my boyfriend?</i>

357
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:19,445
<i>No, listen. We went through
all those names last time.</i>

358
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,750
<i>I don't want to be "Mup-Mup,"
or "Bup-Bup," or "Boop-Boop."</i>

359
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:23,051
<i>Those are puppet names.</i>

360
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:26,458
<i>My name is Artie.
Always been Artie. Call me Artie.</i>

361
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,461
<i>Can I call you "Farty"?</i>

362
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:30,397
<i>That's not a name, dope.</i>

363
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:34,093
<i>Hey, that was a put-down.
You owe me three put-ups.</i>

364
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:36,970
<i>I like your shoes.
I like your shirt. I like your hair.</i>

365
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:37,936
<i>Let's go inside.</i>

366
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,165
<i>You guys all have to change because</i>

367
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,366
<i>we're going out for dinner. Come on.</i>

368
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:41,874
<i>Get the bags, Farty.</i>

369
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:48,145
<i>Alice, this is a beautiful house.</i>

370
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,250
<i>Thank you.</i>

371
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:50,977
<i>- It's a prototype.
- Prototype?</i>

372
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:55,090
<i>Welcome, Alice and
Phil and Harper and Turner and Barker and...</i>

373
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:57,885
<i>two unidentified guests.</i>

374
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,153
<i>But that's not strange.</i>

375
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,159
<i>It's the H-life.</i>

376
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,889
<i>It's Phil's invention.
It's what he's worked on all this time.</i>

377
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:03,896
<i>Wow.</i>

378
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:06,968
<i>This is the brain centre
to this fully automated...</i>

379
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:09,332
<i>voice-activated, prototype smart house.</i>

380
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,974
<i>And I'm just going to enter you two
into the system right now.</i>

381
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:13,404
<i>All right.</i>

382
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,335
<i>Beam me up.</i>

383
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,809
<i>You all get these portables...</i>

384
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:21,473
<i>and if there are any problems,
Turner understands the whole system.</i>

385
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:22,750
<i>Turner does?</i>

386
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:25,080
<i>Well, if Turner can do it,
I certainly can't.</i>

387
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:28,488
<i>Alice, this is so beautiful.</i>

388
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,494
<i>How's work, Dad? How's your season?</i>

389
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:34,129
<i>Very good. Yeah, we had a good season.</i>

390
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:35,821
<i>Yeah, a lot of good kids.</i>

391
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:37,659
<i>You know, your dad still signs off</i>

392
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:39,461
<i>every broadcast, "Lights out, Alice."</i>

393
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:41,604
<i>- Really?
- Yeah.</i>

394
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,168
<i>See, when Alice was a little girl,</i>

395
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:44,636
<i>I wasn't home a lot to put her to bed...</i>

396
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,275
<i>so on the radio I would say...</i>

397
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:49,935
<i>"Lights out, Alice,"
and it sort of stuck, you know?</i>

398
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:51,279
<i>Wow, that's really nice.</i>

399
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:52,347
<i>Yeah.</i>

400
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:54,139
<i>I thought so.</i>

401
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:55,808
<i>What's this?</i>

402
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:58,282
<i>It's some photos.</i>

403
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:03,660
<i>Pipi and Papi look great.</i>

404
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:05,692
<i>Yeah.</i>

405
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:07,454
<i>Here you are.</i>

406
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:09,189
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

407
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:10,560
<i>I took that picture!</i>

408
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:11,928
<i>That was a great day, yeah.</i>

409
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:13,762
<i>Farty wet his pants!</i>

410
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:16,030
<i>Barker, indoor voice.</i>

411
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:19,342
<i>Farty wet his pants! Farty wet his pants!</i>

412
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:23,806
<i>Guns.</i>

413
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:25,345
<i>Guns.</i>

414
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:28,647
<i>Ow! Ow! Ow!</i>

415
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,220
<i>That's so hot!
What are you doing? It's too hot!</i>

416
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,947
<i>Here, do it yourself.</i>

417
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:37,056
<i>What's the matter?</i>

418
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,897
<i>- Do you realize what we are?
- What?</i>

419
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:42,823
<i>We're the "other" grandparents.</i>

420
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:44,432
<i>We can't be all four.</i>

421
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:45,829
<i>I'm serious.</i>

422
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:47,332
<i>They have their real grandparents</i>

423
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:48,836
<i>that they love and put up on the mantle...</i>

424
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:50,904
<i>and then there's us.</i>

425
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:53,406
<i>And who's putting those pictures
on the mantle?</i>

426
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:57,137
<i>Our daughter. She is not sticking up for us.</i>

427
00:18:57,336 --> 00:19:00,476
<i>I don't think the kids
even know what I do. Or did.</i>

428
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:02,208
<i>Look, Artie, I know you're upset</i>

429
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:04,011
<i>about getting kicked in your career...</i>

430
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:05,779
<i>but we need to focus, buddy.</i>

431
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,616
<i>Our grandchildren are going to love me.</i>

432
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,793
<i>- What about me?
- That's your problem.</i>

433
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,826
<i>Welcome!</i>

434
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,932
<i>- New people.
- Hello.</i>

435
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:29,009
<i>These are my parents.
They're going to watch the kids this week.</i>

436
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:30,771
<i>Welcome to Healthy Tiger.</i>

437
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:33,074
<i>All healthy Pan Asian food.</i>

438
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:33,977
<i>What's that?</i>

439
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,414
<i>No MSG, no gluten, no sodium.</i>

440
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:38,781
<i>Just healthy food.</i>

441
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:41,989
<i>I'm drooling already.</i>

442
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,183
<i>Pan Asian, just like me!</i>

443
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:45,691
<i>My mother's Japanese,
my father's Chinese...</i>

444
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:48,364
<i>my kids are Korean
and they go to Hebrew day school.</i>

445
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:50,295
<i>Oy vey</i>

446
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:52,298
<i>Come on. Yeah!</i>

447
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:55,165
<i>How do you ruin Chinese food?</i>

448
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:56,866
<i>Okay.</i>

449
00:19:58,297 --> 00:19:59,674
<i>We seem to have an empty chair.</i>

450
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:00,935
<i>No, no, that chair is for Carl.</i>

451
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:02,942
<i>- Who's Carl?
- Barker's friend.</i>

452
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:04,478
<i>How nice. When's he coming?</i>

453
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:05,978
<i>He's already here.</i>

454
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:08,276
<i>Hi, Carl. You look great.</i>

455
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:10,043
<i>Did you get a haircut?</i>

456
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,488
<i>Tell him.</i>

457
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:16,188
<i>Carl is Barker's imaginary friend.</i>

458
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,689
<i>He's a kangaroo.</i>

459
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,055
<i>Maybe we should have eaten
at the Outback.</i>

460
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:28,501
<i>Kids, go wash your hands.</i>

461
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:31,603
<i>Come on, Carl.</i>

462
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:33,606
<i>Bye, Farty.</i>

463
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,643
<i>He's in a real
"testing the boundaries" phase.</i>

464
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:39,714
<i>Plus, he's also a little constipated.</i>

465
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:41,443
<i>Now, you're talking my language.</i>

466
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,517
<i>I have some stuff that will blow his mind.</i>

467
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:45,154
<i>They used it to blast out the Chunnel.</i>

468
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:46,846
<i>Thank you, Lord Arthur.</i>

469
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:49,184
<i>Now, do you have any
special instructions for us?</i>

470
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:51,327
<i>Like, what the kids like to do,
what they like to eat.</i>

471
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:53,154
<i>Yes, Mom, great. Thank you.</i>

472
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:55,628
<i>First of all, they don't eat any sugar.</i>

473
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:56,891
<i>No Carvel?</i>

474
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,659
<i>That's the saddest thing
I've ever heard in my life.</i>

475
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:01,133
<i>We have tried to introduce
just a little bit of sugar...</i>

476
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:05,172
<i>and it was like going off the rails
of the crazy train.</i>

477
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:06,707
<i>Oh. my gosh!</i>

478
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:08,673
<i>And there's another subject
I'd like to discuss.</i>

479
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:09,902
<i>Sure, anything.</i>

480
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,012
<i>Your language.</i>

481
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,549
<i>He won't curse. I'll break his freaking arm.</i>

482
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,985
<i>That's great, but that's not what I meant.</i>

483
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:18,415
<i>You see, there's a way
that we talk to our kids.</i>

484
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,590
<i>For instance, where you would say "No"...</i>

485
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,157
<i>we would say,
"Consider the consequences."</i>

486
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:24,918
<i>Or where you would say, "Don't"...</i>

487
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,256
<i>we would say, "Maybe you should try this."</i>

488
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,527
<i>Or where you would say...</i>

489
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:31,758
<i>"Quit your whining,
you're giving me a headache"...</i>

490
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,335
<i>we would say, "Use your words."</i>

491
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:35,971
<i>You see, that way, the child feels</i>

492
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,607
<i>that he has value, he has worth.</i>

493
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,434
<i>He is heard.</i>

494
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:41,210
<i>It's a way.</i>

495
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:44,076
<i>Let's order.</i>

496
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:45,945
<i>Great.</i>

497
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:49,544
<i>That's very good, but if you stay</i>

498
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,346
<i>inside the lines, it looks better.</i>

499
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:53,216
<i>Here, look at mine, see?</i>

500
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:55,392
<i>Dad, we don't really worry about lines.</i>

501
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,055
<i>Honey, draw whatever
your imagination tells you.</i>

502
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:01,561
<i>But what's the point
of having lines if you're just going to...?</i>

503
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:02,731
<i>Artie.</i>

504
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:06,369
<i>That's beautiful.
That's absolutely beautiful.</i>

505
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:07,866
<i>It's very avant-garde.</i>

506
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,767
<i>- Picasso.
- Exactly.</i>

507
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:12,807
<i>You didn't finish your dinner.
You know the great thing about Chinese...</i>

508
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:16,969
<i>I mean, Pan Asian food,
is that if you mush it all up it's...</i>

509
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,612
<i>- What happened?</i>

510
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:22,285
<i>- What did you do?
- I don't know.</i>

511
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:24,886
<i>He doesn't like his food to touch.</i>

512
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:26,554
<i>I didn't know! Look, I'm un-smashing.</i>

513
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,725
<i>There's so much un-smashed Pan Asian.</i>

514
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,959
<i>- What?
- Use your words, Barker.</i>

515
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:35,889
<i>Use your words.</i>

516
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:39,126
<i>Farty ruined my food! Evil Farty.</i>

517
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:41,270
<i>Evil Farty, what have you done?</i>

518
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,632
<i>Mama! Dada!</i>

519
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,002
<i>Don't go!</i>

520
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,142
<i>I have to go.</i>

521
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:48,277
<i>Don't go!</i>

522
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,111
<i>Would you--? I'm trying to let go!</i>

523
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:51,440
<i>Don't go!</i>

524
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:53,641
<i>Don't go!</i>

525
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,250
<i>D-Don't go!</i>

526
00:22:56,441 --> 00:22:57,249
<i>Just let go.</i>

527
00:22:57,442 --> 00:22:58,682
<i>He's just so strong.</i>

528
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,652
<i>Let go, baby. Let go, baby.</i>

529
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,654
<i>- Just get in the car.
- I am trying.</i>

530
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:04,452
<i>Barker, honey, just...</i>

531
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:05,957
<i>- Get in the car.
- I love you.</i>

532
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:07,061
<i>I'm trying to get in the car!</i>

533
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,129
<i>Get in the car.</i>

534
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,196
<i>Bye.</i>

535
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:10,264
<i>No!</i>

536
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:11,497
<i>Drive.</i>

537
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:12,464
<i>Bye, honey bun.</i>

538
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:13,931
<i>Goodbye, goodbye.</i>

539
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:15,366
<i>Honey, Stop!</i>

540
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,538
<i>Bye.</i>

541
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:19,672
<i>- Go.
- Yay!</i>

542
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,476
<i>I'll be home really soon.</i>

543
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:22,872
<i>No!</i>

544
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,810
<i>Barker's hyperventilating.
Stop the car, please.</i>

545
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:28,483
<i>- Go, go, go!
- Yay!</i>

546
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:31,313
<i>Give me your worst, worst case scenario.</i>

547
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,547
<i>Everybody dies.</i>

548
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,726
<i>Then anything short of that will be
a happy surprise.</i>

549
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:42,058
<i>Onward.</i>

550
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:44,497
<i>- Really go now.
- No!</i>

551
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:47,161
<i>Good heavens.</i>

552
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:49,771
<i>Time for breakfast.
Come on, we got to get to school.</i>

553
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:53,067
<i>Okay. Let's get this party started!</i>

554
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,710
<i>It's going to be great!
It's going to be awesome!</i>

555
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,345
<i>We are going to have so much fun.</i>

556
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:59,015
<i>This is going to be
the best week of your life!</i>

557
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:00,182
<i>- Right, Artie?
- Sure thing, Regis.</i>

558
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:04,445
<i>Okay. Here we go.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.</i>

559
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:06,384
<i>Oh, my gosh.</i>

560
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:09,423
<i>This is it, right?</i>

561
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:12,618
<i>Yeah. I'll see you on the other side.</i>

562
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,096
<i>These are done.</i>

563
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,927
<i>Hot skillet! Sorry.</i>

564
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,104
<i>All right. Here are your sausages.</i>

565
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,397
<i>Soy sages.</i>

566
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:24,699
<i>Soy sages? What are you, from the Bronx?</i>

567
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:26,603
<i>Did Mom leave my
eggless egg salad for lunch?</i>

568
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:28,539
<i>Eggless egg salad?
How would I recognize it?</i>

569
00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:30,235
<i>The toast is ready.</i>

570
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:31,470
<i>Di, we have to make lunch!</i>

571
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:34,150
<i>I know. It's on the counter.
Make the sandwiches.</i>

572
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:36,216
<i>All right. My waffles, my waffles!</i>

573
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:38,486
<i>I got it.</i>

574
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:43,051
<i>Five second rule. Got it.</i>

575
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:46,786
<i>N-Not too much almond milk
in the c-cereal. It g-gets too wet.</i>

576
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,259
<i>- Is this the right amount?
- Uh-uh.</i>

577
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,455
<i>Well, eat fast.</i>

578
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,926
<i>Okay. Here you go.</i>

579
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:53,466
<i>You have to cut up the berries...</i>

580
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:56,662
<i>and put one piece in each hole
in the multigrain waffle.</i>

581
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:58,136
<i>This food can touch?</i>

582
00:24:58,363 --> 00:24:59,842
<i>Eggless egg salad coming up.</i>

583
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:02,477
<i>Okay, put the lettuce, hit it with the lettuce.</i>

584
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:03,668
<i>It's fine, they will never know.</i>

585
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:05,644
<i>No crust, no crust.</i>

586
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,475
<i>Now there's no sandwich.
Look what you made.</i>

587
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:12,955
<i>I like them, Carl likes them. Right, Carl?</i>

588
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:16,819
<i>And your opinion has value.
And, what's the other one?</i>

589
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:17,823
<i>Worth.</i>

590
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:21,122
<i>But I know from experience
that wearing heels can be tricky.</i>

591
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:22,525
<i>Especially during recess.</i>

592
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:25,429
<i>Wouldn't you and Carl
both be more comfortable in sneakers?</i>

593
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:26,534
<i>No.</i>

594
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:28,534
<i>Hey, what's going on?
We are going to be late.</i>

595
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:32,035
<i>It's Project Hun way.</i>

596
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,540
<i>l tried handling
it like Alice said, but it's not working.</i>

597
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:36,474
<i>All right,
get the other two in the car, I'll handle this.</i>

598
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:37,339
<i>Artie.</i>

599
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,345
<i>It's okay. Let me try.</i>

600
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,043
<i>Take off those shoes
and I'll give you a dollar.</i>

601
00:25:44,242 --> 00:25:45,312
<i>- Five.
- Two-fifty.</i>

602
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:46,682
<i>Deal.</i>

603
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:48,820
<i>Just punch in "go to school."</i>

604
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:51,460
<i>Why is this easier than
you just telling me how to get there?</i>

605
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,391
<i>- l heard that.
- Whoa! Whoa!</i>

606
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:55,963
<i>Is he in there?</i>

607
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:57,428
<i>It's Dad, and it's a recording.</i>

608
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:58,897
<i>It's just a little family joke.</i>

609
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:02,037
<i>Yeah, it's interesting
because, usually, jokes are funny.</i>

610
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,729
<i>But hey, why kill time laughing?</i>

611
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:05,135
<i>Okay, here you go.</i>

612
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,308
<i>- Thank you.
- What?</i>

613
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:07,306
<i>."Go garage-"
.Go garage-</i>

614
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:08,443
<i>Say it with force.</i>

615
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,578
<i>Go garage. Go garage.</i>

616
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,346
<i>Welcome back, Alice.</i>

617
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:13,073
<i>Mommy!</i>

618
00:26:13,271 --> 00:26:15,808
<i>Alice, what happened? Where's Phil?</i>

619
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:17,077
<i>He's on his way to the airport.</i>

620
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,312
<i>I'm going to meet him in a few hours.</i>

621
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,420
<i>There's an 8:00 flight tonight.</i>

622
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:20,351
<i>But...</i>

623
00:26:20,545 --> 00:26:21,353
<i>One of my clients called.</i>

624
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:23,423
<i>They need me to update
their website immediately.</i>

625
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:24,855
<i>Can't it wait until you get back?</i>

626
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:27,496
<i>No, it's ESPN.
There's a crisis with the X Games.</i>

627
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:28,756
<i>You work for ESPN?</i>

628
00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:31,434
<i>Yeah, I'm one of their web
designers. Honey, get in the backseat.</i>

629
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:33,261
<i>Really? I didn't know that.</i>

630
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:37,168
<i>It's interesting. ESPN. Really?</i>

631
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:40,273
<i>Nice school.</i>

632
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:42,240
<i>How long have you been working for ESPN?</i>

633
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,538
<i>About five years.</i>

634
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:45,112
<i>- Really?
Mmm-hmm.</i>

635
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:49,848
<i>Turner...</i>

636
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:51,884
<i>Artie is going to pick you up after school...</i>

637
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:54,079
<i>and take you to speech therapy today.</i>

638
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,725
<i>Wh-Wh-Where are you-you going to be?</i>

639
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:58,792
<i>Grandma and I are going
to buy Harper a dress.</i>

640
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:00,122
<i>Great.</i>

641
00:27:00,318 --> 00:27:01,092
<i>Have a good day, you two.</i>

642
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,458
<i>See you later.</i>

643
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:04,133
<i>I can't believe I'm going to get a tardy.</i>

644
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:05,824
<i>Six tardies are an absent.</i>

645
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:07,128
<i>How many does this make?</i>

646
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:08,463
<i>One.</i>

647
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:12,104
<i>Does she seem a little tightly wound?</i>

648
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:15,244
<i>You know, she has HAS.
High Achievement Syndrome.</i>

649
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:16,411
<i>Did you make that up?</i>

650
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:17,636
<i>Yes.</i>

651
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:18,814
<i>Hurry up, I can't get a tardy.</i>

652
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:22,178
<i>I know she's a little tightly wound.
But we're working on it.</i>

653
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:24,479
<i>Work on it soon before she explodes.</i>

654
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:30,452
<i>W-W-Watch where you're going,
Tu-Tu-Tu-Turner.</i>

655
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:32,590
<i>S-S-Sorry.</i>

656
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:35,792
<i>Hey, did you see that?</i>

657
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,625
<i>Dad, no. No.</i>

658
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,233
<i>Turner's therapist says that he has</i>

659
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:40,836
<i>to work out peer conflicts on his own.</i>

660
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:42,004
<i>He has a therapist?</i>

661
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:44,434
<i>He had one,
and now he has a new one, Dr. Jimmy.</i>

662
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:45,835
<i>Also a kid?</i>

663
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:46,805
<i>No.</i>

664
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,639
<i>ESPN again. I need to get to a Wi-Fi.</i>

665
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,337
<i>Maybe I can use the one here.</i>

666
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:53,743
<i>Go ahead, I'll get Barker to school.</i>

667
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:55,083
<i>Are you sure?</i>

668
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:56,513
<i>Sure. What's the problem?</i>

669
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:57,982
<i>Okay.</i>

670
00:27:58,677 --> 00:27:59,655
<i>Got the H-life.</i>

671
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:02,658
<i>But then pick me up here.
Don't leave me stranded.</i>

672
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,258
<i>Have I ever left you stranded?</i>

673
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:05,860
<i>Four times when I was a kid.</i>

674
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:08,258
<i>I love how you remember everything.</i>

675
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:21,136
<i>Okay, Barker, hop out.</i>

676
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:23,107
<i>I can't. I'm still buckled in.</i>

677
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:24,109
<i>Carl, unbuckle him.</i>

678
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:26,714
<i>Hello? He's at a doctor's appointment.</i>

679
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:29,347
<i>Stupid me. Okay.</i>

680
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:38,483
<i>Boy, this is harder than
one of your grandma's bras.</i>

681
00:28:38,683 --> 00:28:39,684
<i>I'm going to be late.</i>

682
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,693
<i>- I'm tr--...</i>

683
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:46,632
<i>It works, okay? Your horn works.</i>

684
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:52,834
<i>I won't need this by the time you're done.</i>

685
00:28:58,603 --> 00:29:01,049
<i>Here you go. Here.</i>

686
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,719
<i>Careful, he's a runner.</i>

687
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:07,179
<i>Bye, Farty.</i>

688
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:11,424
<i>One second.</i>

689
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:13,323
<i>- Hey, Ash.
- Hey, Cody.</i>

690
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:15,191
<i>- Did you get my Evite?
- Yep, I'm coming.</i>

691
00:29:15,386 --> 00:29:16,865
<i>Cool.</i>

692
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:20,195
<i>This is my friend, Harper. This is Cody.</i>

693
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:21,734
<i>- Hey.
- Hi.</i>

694
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,431
<i>I'm having this birthday thing Friday night.</i>

695
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:26,573
<i>There's going to be a DJ, and my parents</i>

696
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:28,608
<i>promised not to be ridiculously lame.</i>

697
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,006
<i>Right. Parents.</i>

698
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:33,774
<i>So, if you want to swing by,
that would be pretty cool.</i>

699
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:35,747
<i>Oh. Um...</i>

700
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:39,578
<i>I can't.</i>

701
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:44,225
<i>I got this thing the next day.</i>

702
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:45,951
<i>- She has a thing.
- I got a thing.</i>

703
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:47,721
<i>Okay. That's cool.</i>

704
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,262
<i>Yeah. No, it's super cool.</i>

705
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,434
<i>Well, if you change your mind,
just, you know...</i>

706
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,102
<i>Yeah. Totally, I'll...</i>

707
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,269
<i>Cool.</i>

708
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:56,032
<i>Bye.</i>

709
00:29:58,463 --> 00:29:59,203
<i>Stop it.</i>

710
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:02,907
<i>Microwave on.</i>

711
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:04,102
<i>Garbage disposal on.</i>

712
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,640
<i>Vacuum cleaner on.</i>

713
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:10,785
<i>Oh, please, just let me do the dishes.</i>

714
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:14,120
<i>Welcome back,
Artie Decker.</i>

715
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:16,591
<i>What a morning.</i>

716
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:19,284
<i>It's 9 AM, I need a martini.</i>

717
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:20,758
<i>Tell me something.</i>

718
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:22,729
<i>Did you believe that story?</i>

719
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:25,128
<i>Absolutely not. What story?</i>

720
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,098
<i>Alice's work emergency.</i>

721
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:28,262
<i>You think she was lying?</i>

722
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:30,564
<i>Why couldn't that
work have been done at Hilton Head?</i>

723
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:32,935
<i>It's like she doesn't trust us with her kids.</i>

724
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:34,735
<i>Like she thinks we're idiots.</i>

725
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,442
<i>By the way, where is she?</i>

726
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,320
<i>Where have you been?</i>

727
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:53,589
<i>I know.</i>

728
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,263
<i>You know, Harper, when I was your age...</i>

729
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:05,907
<i>this was my favourite time of the day,
right after school.</i>

730
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:07,235
<i>Why, what did you do?</i>

731
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:08,672
<i>We used to go to my friend Heidi's house...</i>

732
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,279
<i>put on her mother's clothes,
blast music and smoke.</i>

733
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:12,847
<i>-- Mom!</i>

734
00:31:12,937 --> 00:31:14,917
<i>Don't smoke. Don't smoke.</i>

735
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:26,026
<i>Oh, Lulu, that was so great.</i>

736
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:28,026
<i>Honey, you're really
starting to take control...</i>

737
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:30,927
<i>and literally holding the reins.</i>

738
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:32,624
<i>Okay, Turner...</i>

739
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:34,800
<i>would you like to share?</i>

740
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:52,051
<i>Good work, Turner.</i>

741
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:54,189
<i>Awesome.</i>

742
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,486
<i>Super job, Lulu. See you next week?</i>

743
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:00,822
<i>Thank you.</i>

744
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:05,056
<i>That was really awesome.</i>

745
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,860
<i>I take it you're Turner's grandfather.</i>

746
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:08,393
<i>Hi.</i>

747
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:10,235
<i>I'm Artie Decker.</i>

748
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:12,135
<i>Cassandra.</i>

749
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,071
<i>You seem to be having some trouble</i>

750
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:15,872
<i>embracing our program, am I right?</i>

751
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:18,172
<i>Well, let me say first,</i>

752
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,306
<i>that I have professional experience
in this area.</i>

753
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:22,644
<i>Oh, wonderful.
Where did you receive your degree?</i>

754
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,910
<i>Oh, no degree. No.</i>

755
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:27,419
<i>I speak for a living.
I'm a baseball announcer.</i>

756
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:31,826
<i>Little different than a PhD
in speech therapy from Yale. Right?</i>

757
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:33,862
<i>- Right. Yeah.</i>

758
00:32:34,552 --> 00:32:36,532
<i>That's a point well taken.</i>

759
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:38,564
<i>But on the other hand,
I sat here for almost an hour...</i>

760
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:41,498
<i>and I saw these kids
do everything but speak.</i>

761
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:43,263
<i>So, are you training them to be mimes?</i>

762
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,941
<i>Because a lot of those jobs
are being shipped overseas.</i>

763
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:54,640
<i>"I'm walking, but there's wind,</i>

764
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:56,719
<i>"but there's no wind." You know?</i>

765
00:32:58,242 --> 00:33:01,746
<i>Okay. I am employing
the Houghton method.</i>

766
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:03,983
<i>Now these kids, they're under
too much pressure to speak...</i>

767
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:07,356
<i>so we make it very
clear that in here, they need not say a word.</i>

768
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:09,725
<i>They're currently in a movement phase.</i>

769
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:10,899
<i>Yeah, I saw that.</i>

770
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:13,399
<i>They're moving everything but their lips.</i>

771
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:15,093
<i>And he wears these ear buds all the time.</i>

772
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:16,567
<i>What's that about?</i>

773
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:18,434
<i>He is listening to the words
that he has trouble with...</i>

774
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:21,576
<i>and then when
he's comfortable, he can repeat them.</i>

775
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:23,006
<i>And it's helping him a lot.</i>

776
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:24,236
<i>How can you tell?</i>

777
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:26,444
<i>Listen, I haven't seen the kid in a year...</i>

778
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:28,776
<i>and frankly, I don't see
any improvement at all.</i>

779
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:31,419
<i>What I see is my grandson is now Flight 38</i>

780
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:33,216
<i>- from Salt Lake.</i>

781
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:35,919
<i>Hey, Turner!</i>

782
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:38,025
<i>Cassandra's just telling me
how great you're doing.</i>

783
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:40,924
<i>She sees so much improvement. It's great.</i>

784
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:47,696
<i>Sometimes I shouldn't move my lips.
I'm sorry.</i>

785
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:53,272
<i>That's not bad.</i>

786
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:55,944
<i>"Not bad"?
She looks like a 12-year-old widow.</i>

787
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:58,881
<i>- I do?
- You do.</i>

788
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,744
<i>But that's perfect
for a classical music program.</i>

789
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:03,646
<i>Well, what about this?</i>

790
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:06,913
<i>This is perfect for someone
with a cute little hiney.</i>

791
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:08,446
<i>I love it.</i>

792
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:11,149
<i>Mom, it's for a concert,
not to meet the fleet.</i>

793
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:14,159
<i>Hey, it's an audition,
and all auditions are alike.</i>

794
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:15,660
<i>"Get their attention! "</i>

795
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:17,389
<i>You sell the sizzle, not the steak.</i>

796
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:19,329
<i>That's how I got all those weather girl jobs.</i>

797
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:21,299
<i>So, are you a trained meteorologist?</i>

798
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:22,470
<i>Trained?</i>

799
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,731
<i>Oh, honey, I had a tight dress and a pointer.</i>

800
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:26,340
<i>I used to sing my forecasts.</i>

801
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:28,067
<i>As a matter of fact, sometimes your mom</i>

802
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:30,271
<i>used to sing them with me on TV.</i>

803
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:31,674
<i>Mom, you never even told me that!</i>

804
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:32,770
<i>I mentioned it.</i>

805
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:34,813
<i>Remember our winter song?
That was our best one.</i>

806
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:36,212
<i>No, I don't remember that one.</i>

807
00:34:36,307 --> 00:34:37,308
<i>Sure you do.</i>

808
00:34:37,508 --> 00:34:38,748
<i>We sang it 1,000 times.</i>

809
00:34:38,943 --> 00:34:41,617
<i>I love you. Come on, please.
No one's watching.</i>

810
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:42,757
<i>Only for you.</i>

811
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:44,255
<i>Ready?</i>

812
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:48,795
<i>Button up your overcoat
in the wintry breeze</i>

813
00:34:48,986 --> 00:34:52,957
<i>Take good care of yourself
'cause it's nine degrees!</i>

814
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,593
<i>Good job, Mom.</i>

815
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:55,668
<i>Do the spin.</i>

816
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,670
<i>Okay.
I'll never shop at Bloomingdale's again.</i>

817
00:34:58,863 --> 00:35:00,638
<i>Aw! You still got it, kiddo.</i>

818
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:02,505
<i>That was great. Ah!</i>

819
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:04,603
<i>All right, now...</i>

820
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:06,975
<i>you've got to try this on.
I'm dying to see this on you.</i>

821
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:08,479
<i>- Okay.
- Okay.</i>

822
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:12,883
<i>Mom. She cannot wear
a cocktail dress to the audition.</i>

823
00:35:13,077 --> 00:35:15,318
<i>I'd like to feel that you're listening to me.</i>

824
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:17,186
<i>Oh, I'm sorry, honey.
Did you say something?</i>

825
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:18,522
<i>No, no.</i>

826
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:20,662
<i>Look at this. This is a hot little number.</i>

827
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,730
<i>Oh, not for her. For me.</i>

828
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:26,697
<i>Cue the band.</i>

829
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:32,097
<i>Hey. What are you doing?</i>

830
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:33,775
<i>Guarding the door.</i>

831
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:34,943
<i>Can I go in?</i>

832
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,271
<i>Not today, sir.</i>

833
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:37,502
<i>Is he crying?</i>

834
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:39,843
<i>He doesn't cry, he makes the face.</i>

835
00:35:42,073 --> 00:35:43,609
<i>I didn't mean to upset him.</i>

836
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,879
<i>You should've used your exit shoes.</i>

837
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:46,714
<i>My What?</i>

838
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:50,381
<i>Exit shoes, to walk away
and not use a red voice.</i>

839
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:52,151
<i>And a red voice is...?</i>

840
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:56,355
<i>Super-mad sounding.
You shouldn't use it. Never.</i>

841
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:59,728
<i>- Uh-huh.
- That's why you have a cool toolbox.</i>

842
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:02,097
<i>It's where you keep your cool blue voice,</i>

843
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:04,332
<i>your exit shoes and your repair squares.</i>

844
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:06,135
<i>Where did you learn all this?</i>

845
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,240
<i>Preschool.</i>

846
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:09,638
<i>You mean, there are more kids like you?</i>

847
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,644
<i>I'm doomed. All right, I'm going in there.</i>

848
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,214
<i>What's in it for me?</i>

849
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,088
<i>Thank you.</i>

850
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,416
<i>The little capitalist.</i>

851
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:28,193
<i>Hi, there.</i>

852
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:32,198
<i>All right, so I am taking a repair
square out of my cool toolbox...</i>

853
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:35,166
<i>to say in my blue voice, that I am sorry.</i>

854
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,006
<i>So, are we good now?</i>

855
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:39,104
<i>No.</i>

856
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:40,935
<i>- Would you like five dollars?
- No.</i>

857
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:43,840
<i>An unopened package
of men's size 34 underwear?</i>

858
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:44,843
<i>No.</i>

859
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,879
<i>Is there anything I can do
to make this right?</i>

860
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:50,378
<i>W-Well, th-there is one thing.</i>

861
00:36:54,278 --> 00:36:55,052
<i>Aaargh!</i>

862
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,757
<i>They made six of these?</i>

863
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:01,596
<i>07'</i>

864
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:04,761
<i>Now, this is Artie's idea of fun.</i>

865
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:07,568
<i>Ooh! Look at that.</i>

866
00:37:07,758 --> 00:37:10,068
<i>Who knew ice cream could be a cake?</i>

867
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:12,263
<i>Yeah. All right, now here's the deal.</i>

868
00:37:12,463 --> 00:37:13,840
<i>Just little pieces...</i>

869
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:17,069
<i>and you don't tell Mommy
about the movie...</i>

870
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:19,942
<i>and I don't tell her about the cake.</i>

871
00:37:20,137 --> 00:37:22,845
<i>Okay? All right? Deal? Friends again?</i>

872
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:23,714
<i>High five! All right.</i>

00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:46,599
<i>I will be right back.</i>

878
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:57,246
<i>Ms. Pam Rosen, please.</i>

879

<i>My name is Cal R. Life.</i>

<i>Yeah. L-Y-P-H-E-T. The "T" is silent.</i>

<i>What a great day.
It's like a birthday that came early.</i>

<i>It was a great day.</i>

883
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,495
<i>And my forecast for the rest of the week...</i>

884
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:13,762
<i>- Sunny, sunny, sunny.</i>

885
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,403
<i>Back to you, Herb.</i>

886
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:17,800
<i>Oh, it's your dad, I'll be right in.</i>

<i>Hi!</i>

00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:20,431
<i>Today is your lucky day, Ms. Rosen.</i>

889

<i>The catfish just jumped
right into your frying pan.</i>

890
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:25,812
<i>Yeah, Artie Decker, "De Voice" is in town.</i>

891
00:38:26,003 --> 00:38:28,415
<i>He heard about your X Games

892
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:31,450
<i>I'm just walking in.
Video chat me in 2 minutes, okay?</i>

893
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:34,248
<i>Hi, Artie, we're back!
Did you have fun with the boys?</i>

894
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:38,452
<i>Look at this place!
We're going to have to call FEMA!</i>

895
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:39,354
<i>Cake.</i>

896
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:41,291
<i>- Where's Artie?
- He left!</i>

897
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:42,463
<i>He left?</i>

898
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:43,961
<i>-- If your mother sees this--</i>

899
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,099
<i>What's going on?</i>

900
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,992
<i>- Hi.</i>

901
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,327
<i>What did you do?</i>

902
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:51,336
<i>I just got here!</i>

903
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:52,837
<i>You gave them cake?</i>

904
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,475
<i>I gave them slivers.</i>

905
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,008
<i>Why? Why, Artie?</i>

906
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,871
<i>Because he upset Turner at Speech Class.</i>

907
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,014
<i>- What?
- It was nothing.</i>

908
00:39:00,237 --> 00:39:01,375
<i>I just asked a question.</i>

909
00:39:01,472 --> 00:39:02,576
<i>"Why is nobody speaking?" That's all.</i>

910
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:05,349
<i>Hello, lave!</i>

911
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:09,184
<i>I can't wait for
you to get here, me little rabbit.</i>

<i>Shh! Not now! Oh, my.</i>

913

<i>- Did he have a tattoo?
- Hmm?</i>

914
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:18,365
<i>Harper?</i>

915
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:22,103
<i>Mom! You lied to me!</i>

916
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:24,000
<i>Yogurt is not like ice cream!</i>

917
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:25,130
<i>No, honey.</i>

918
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:28,640
<i>Baby?</i>

919
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:31,643
<i>- My favourite!
- Harper!</i>

920
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,972
<i>- Ooh!</i>

921
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:41,820
<i>This perfectly sums up
your entire approach to parenting.</i>

922
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:42,990
<i>We had an approach?</i>

923
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,158
<i>I don't know.</i>

924
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:47,955
<i>Would Artie and
Turner like to continue watching Saw?</i>

925
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:50,132
<i>You must be mistaken.</i>

926
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:52,232
<i>Saw, Rated R for strong graphic violence,</i>

927
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:53,529
<i>nudity and language.</i>

928
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:54,725
<i>No.</i>

929
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,534
<i>Why did he give them cake?</i>

930
00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:59,068
<i>Because he does what he wants
and she defends him!</i>

931
00:39:59,263 --> 00:40:00,298
<i>Where are the kids now?</i>

932
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:03,143
<i>Oh, I put them
on the treadmill until they calm down.</i>

933
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:05,837
<i>I told you my parents couldn’t handle this.</i>

934
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:09,017
<i>Maybe it's just a case
of first-day, worst-day.</i>

935
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:10,107
<i>Oh.</i>

936
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:13,211
<i>Hey. You better hurry up.
You're going to miss your flight.</i>

937
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,891
<i>Honey, I don't think that I should go today.</i>

938
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:17,855
<i>Maybe I should go tomorrow morning.</i>

939
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:18,992
<i>Okay. Yeah.</i>

940
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,153
<i>We 'll still have four days together.</i>

941
00:40:21,685 --> 00:40:22,493
<i>okay.</i>

942
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:23,892
<i>You look good in cake.</i>

943
00:40:29,293 --> 00:40:31,034
<i>What in the world is wrong with you?</i>

944
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:32,735
<i>What did I say?</i>

945
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,432
<i>What did I say to you?</i>

946
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:35,736
<i>Just talk to me. Don't yell.</i>

947
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:37,742
<i>I said, "Artie,
this is a second chance for us."</i>

948
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:39,278
<i>I said, "Artie, please behave."</i>

949
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:42,041
<i>I said, "Artie, I really want
those kids to love us!"</i>

950
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:44,913
<i>Or can't you remember
all the way back to yesterday?</i>

951
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,087
<i>Okay, that's what I did.</i>

952
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,257
<i>When the cake
went in their mouths they loved me!</i>

953
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:51,393
<i>Yeah, and now Alice
doesn't want to leave us alone with them.</i>

954
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:52,560
<i>She doesn't trust us!</i>

955
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:53,728
<i>She said that?</i>

956
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:55,363
<i>On the phone to Phil.</i>

957
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,560
<i>I accidentally overheard her
when I was listening at the door.</i>

958
00:40:58,989 --> 00:41:01,401
<i>She thinks we're a pair of knuckleheads.</i>

959
00:41:01,725 --> 00:41:03,102
<i>Especially you!</i>

960
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,569
<i>It's the bottom of the ninth, Artie.</i>

961
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:10,609
<i>We're going to lose the game.</i>

962
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,242
<i>Shape UP-</i>

963
00:41:33,757 --> 00:41:34,792
<i>Oh!</i>

964
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,263
<i>Wonderful. Oh!</i>

965
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,070
<i>Bravo.</i>

966
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:45,443
<i>Oh, wow! Harper, that was wonderful!</i>

967
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:46,614
<i>I stunk.</i>

968
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:47,805
<i>You most certainly did not!</i>

969
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:51,414
<i>Wasn't she wonderful?</i>

970
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:52,417
<i>No.</i>

971
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:54,783
<i>This will not be good enough
for your audition!</i>

972
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:56,481
<i>You must practice more!</i>

973
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,320
<i>When my daughter underperforms,
I shun her.</i>

974
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,519
<i>This girl should be shunned!</i>

975
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:04,990
<i>Practice, practice, practice!</i>

976
00:42:05,823 --> 00:42:07,427
<i>Gee whiz.</i>

977
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:10,504
<i>Wasn't she the villain
in the last James Bond movie?</i>

978
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:12,835
<i>Oh! Sweetie, don't listen to her.</i>

979
00:42:14,398 --> 00:42:17,174
<i>You know back in Amarillo,
when Artie was announcing there...</i>

980
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,609
<i>I got this audition
to be the local weather girl.</i>

981
00:42:19,803 --> 00:42:21,714
<i>Well, I was so uptight.</i>

982
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:25,183
<i>Artie took me out the night before and we
both got bombed!</i>

983
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:27,447
<i>And the next day I got the job.</i>

984
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:29,681
<i>So, you're saying I should drink?</i>

985
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:32,689
<i>No, no, no. I'm not saying that.</i>

986
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:35,523
<i>I am saying that perhaps you could relax.</i>

987
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:36,993
<i>You could go out with your friends.</i>

988
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:40,031
<i>You could have some fun Friday night.
You know?</i>

989
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:43,769
<i>Friday, I was invited to a--</i>

990
00:42:44,261 --> 00:42:45,296
<i>Oh.</i>

991
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:48,907
<i>No.</i>

992
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:50,177
<i>No, no, no!</i>

993
00:42:50,801 --> 00:42:54,010
<i>I have three more days!
I have to practice! I have to--</i>

994
00:42:54,204 --> 00:42:56,844
<i>I have to practice every second!</i>

995
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,788
<i>Doctor Schveer?</i>

996
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:03,383
<i>Yes?</i>

997
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,356
<i>Perhaps we got off on the wrong foot.</i>

998
00:43:05,549 --> 00:43:06,721
<i>But I would like to let you know that...</i>

999
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:09,557
<i>if you ever speak
to my granddaughter like that again...</i>

1000
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:11,061
<i>there will be nothing left of you,</i>

1001
00:43:11,155 --> 00:43:12,429
<i>but some red hair and an accent!</i>

1002
00:43:12,623 --> 00:43:14,398
<i>Is that clear, comrade?</i>

1003
00:43:38,816 --> 00:43:40,625
<i>Ooh! Thank you. Here you go.</i>

1004
00:43:40,884 --> 00:43:42,022
<i>Mmm!</i>

1005
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:45,489
<i>Carcinogens.</i>

1006
00:43:46,523 --> 00:43:47,831
<i>Oh, the first one just laid a base.</i>

1007
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:50,505
<i>This is the real thing. I'm at the ballpark.</i>

1008
00:43:54,765 --> 00:43:56,403
<i>He likes baseball, huh?</i>

1009
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,578
<i>Yeah, he likes lots of things.</i>

1010
00:43:57,768 --> 00:44:01,272
<i>He likes sports.
He likes science, he likes movies.</i>

1011
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:02,780
<i>He likes cake.</i>

1012
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:04,145
<i>Touché.</i>

1013
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:07,853
<i>He's just hidden behind that... stutter.</i>

1014
00:44:08,045 --> 00:44:10,651
<i>Well, you know, kids have a way
of working these things out.</i>

1015
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:12,126
<i>No, they don't, Dad.</i>

1016
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:13,989
<i>That's why there's prison.</i>

1017
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:17,488
<i>All right, guys, bring it in!</i>

1018
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:19,258
<i>Bring it in! Get all those hands in there.</i>

1019
00:44:19,456 --> 00:44:20,366
<i>Come on.</i>

1020
00:44:20,557 --> 00:44:23,834
<i>Everybody on three. One, two, three...</i>

1021
00:44:24,028 --> 00:44:25,974
<i>Let's have fun!</i>

1022
00:44:27,231 --> 00:44:29,711
<i>I am so excited about this.</i>

1023
00:44:30,234 --> 00:44:31,178
<i>Let's play!</i>

1024
00:44:31,368 --> 00:44:32,278
<i>He's pitching!</i>

1025
00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:33,209
<i>Yeah.</i>

1026
00:44:33,404 --> 00:44:34,405
<i>He has a good arm.</i>

1027
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:35,483
<i>Like Mom, like son.</i>

1028
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:36,651
<i>Yeah, right.</i>

1029
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,183
<i>No, you had a hose.</i>

1030
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:40,116
<i>But then you hit puberty
and you got all girlie on me.</i>

1031
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:42,312
<i>Well, gee, Dad,
I'm so sorry that I hit puberty.</i>

1032
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:43,651
<i>I was so proud of you back then.</i>

1033
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:45,520
<i>You were usually the only girl out there.</i>

1034
00:44:45,916 --> 00:44:48,123
<i>You used to stand up to those stinky boys.</i>

1035
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:50,229
<i>Do you remember that summer
when you worked for me in the booth...</i>

1036
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:52,162
<i>keeping score and doing stats?</i>

1037
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:53,733
<i>You were so cute, sitting there</i>

1038
00:44:53,824 --> 00:44:55,861
<i>- scrunched over your little pencil.</i>

1039
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,862
<i>You never saw that ball coming, did you?</i>

1040
00:44:58,062 --> 00:44:59,166
<i>You could have yelled "Incoming</i>

1041
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:01,206
<i>I was on the air.
I didn't want to start a panic.</i>

1042
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:03,173
<i>You do love that job.</i>

1043
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:04,402
<i>- Yeah.
- Yeah.</i>

1044
00:45:04,601 --> 00:45:05,579
<i>Yeah, I do.</i>

1045
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:06,747
<i>Batter up!</i>

1046
00:45:08,072 --> 00:45:09,551
<i>Ah! This is that bully kid.</i>

1047
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:10,912
<i>Yeah, Ivan.</i>

1048
00:45:11,108 --> 00:45:13,486
<i>I would so like to see Turner strike him out.</i>

1049
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:24,524
<i>Strike!</i>

1050
00:45:24,955 --> 00:45:28,198
<i>Strike one!
Hey, he is really good. He's really good.</i>

1051
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:29,871
<i>Way to go, Turner!</i>

1052
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,038
<i>Turner Simmons on the mound...</i>

1053
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:33,708
<i>a young Cuban prospect
who escaped on a raft.</i>

1054
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,342
<i>He's facing Ivan, a miserable child</i>

1055
00:45:35,432 --> 00:45:36,843
<i>who is loathed and despised by everyone.</i>

1056
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:38,069
<i>- Dad!</i>

1057
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:43,878
<i>Swing and a miss! Strike two! Hoo-hoo!</i>

1058
00:45:43,974 --> 00:45:45,578
<i>One more strike and it's back</i>

1059
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:47,212
<i>to the dugout
for this eight-year-old bullfrog.</i>

1060
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:48,321
<i>Dad...</i>

1061
00:45:48,545 --> 00:45:51,651
<i>The yearbook said
Ivan is "Most likely to do time."</i>

1062
00:45:53,684 --> 00:45:55,027
<i>Simmons looks at him.</i>

1063
00:45:57,287 --> 00:45:58,322
<i>He shakes it off.</i>

1064
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:03,571
<i>Here's the pitch.</i>

1065
00:46:04,695 --> 00:46:07,232
<i>Strike three!
You're out of there!</i>

1066
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:10,502
<i>Lights out, Alice!</i>

1067
00:46:13,971 --> 00:46:15,917
<i>Way to go, Turner! Way to look!</i>

1068
00:46:16,173 --> 00:46:18,619
<i>Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Blue, Blue! That's three strikes!</i>

1069
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:20,922
<i>One, two, three! Out of there!</i>

1070
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:22,419
<i>Time!</i>

1071
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:23,915
<i>It's okay!</i>

1072
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:26,185
<i>This is my dad and he's new here!</i>

1073
00:46:26,483 --> 00:46:29,123
<i>Oh, okay. There are no outs in this game.</i>

1074
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:31,630
<i>No outs? How is that possible?</i>

1075
00:46:31,822 --> 00:46:35,360
<i>They hit until they get on base.</i>

1076
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:37,266
<i>- Seriously?
- Seriously.</i>

1077
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:39,099
<i>- Dad, why don't we just sit down?
- Oh...</i>

1078
00:46:41,064 --> 00:46:42,042
<i>All right.</i>

1079
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,108
<i>But you know that's kind of stupid!</i>

1080
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:46,747
<i>Because if you just think of the song...</i>

1081
00:46:46,937 --> 00:46:49,213
<i>'Cause it's one, two,
three strikes, you're out...</i>

1082
00:46:49,406 --> 00:46:50,749
<i>at the old ball game</i>

1083
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:51,646
<i>Not...</i>

1084
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:53,219
<i>until you get a hit</i>

1085
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:55,890
<i>He's right!
I hate these games! What's the point?</i>

1086
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:58,650
<i>The point is for the kids
to enjoy the game without competition.</i>

1087
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:00,226
<i>Yeah, but competition is the game.</i>

1088
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:01,487
<i>You know, it's like life.</i>

1089
00:47:01,685 --> 00:47:02,789
<i>Let me ask you something.</i>

1090
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:04,431
<i>I mean, how do you even
know who's winning?</i>

1091
00:47:04,755 --> 00:47:06,234
<i>In this league, we don't keep score.</i>

1092
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:09,794
<i>Every game ends in a tie.</i>

1093
00:47:10,961 --> 00:47:12,235
<i>Oh, no.</i>

1094
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:15,501
<i>No agony of defeat? Just the thrill of a tie?</i>

1095
00:47:15,699 --> 00:47:17,269
<i>It's good they don't keep score!</i>

1096
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:18,775
<i>Yeah, 'cause your kid stinks.</i>

1097
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:20,505
<i>Oh, I will bust you up!</i>

1098
00:47:20,704 --> 00:47:22,274
<i>The old guy's right. It's boring.</i>

1099
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:23,109
<i>See?</i>

1100
00:47:23,307 --> 00:47:25,048
<i>It is not boring!</i>

1101
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:27,218
<i>They're children and they're having fun!</i>

1102
00:47:27,411 --> 00:47:29,755
<i>And there's plenty of time
in their lives to keep score!</i>

1103
00:47:29,947 --> 00:47:31,392
<i>- And you are out!
- No, I'm not.</i>

1104
00:47:31,582 --> 00:47:33,493
<i>Oh, yeah. Turner, you struck him out.</i>

1105
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:34,890
<i>- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.</i>

1106
00:47:35,085 --> 00:47:35,893
<i>- You're out.
- No, I'm not!</i>

1107
00:47:36,086 --> 00:47:36,791
<i>- You're out!
- No, I'm not!</i>

1108
00:47:36,987 --> 00:47:38,091
<i>- Three strikes, you're out!
- No, I'm not!</i>

1109
00:47:38,288 --> 00:47:39,426
<i>Barker, what's going on?</i>

1110
00:47:39,623 --> 00:47:41,227
<i>Farty is going crazy.</i>

1111
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:42,403
<i>Again?</i>

1112
00:47:42,593 --> 00:47:43,970
<i>- You're out!
- No, you're out!</i>

1113
00:47:46,263 --> 00:47:49,836
<i>Ivan, no hitting!
Use your words!</i>

1114
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:51,444
<i>Yes, Mom.</i>

1115
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:55,981
<i>I'm angry that you said I was out.</i>

1116
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,751
<i>Well, it's not boring anymore.</i>

1117
00:48:07,317 --> 00:48:09,194
<i>How is this Artie's fault?</i>

1118
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:12,026
<i>All I saw was
that little monster grab a baseball bat...</i>

1119
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:14,600
<i>and hit your father in his... special place.</i>

1120
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:16,998
<i>Well, you didn't see what led up to it.</i>

1121
00:48:17,194 --> 00:48:17,797
<i>Oh!</i>

1122
00:48:19,363 --> 00:48:21,274
<i>- It was my fault.
- Oh, honey.</i>

1123
00:48:21,665 --> 00:48:23,372
<i>You threatened her violin teacher?</i>

1124
00:48:23,967 --> 00:48:25,002
<i>She says "threatened."</i>

1125
00:48:25,202 --> 00:48:27,307
<i>I say "defended my granddaughter."</i>

1126
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:31,008
<i>- Phil?
- Hey.</i>

1127
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:33,313
<i>Hey, we won. I won!</i>

1128
00:48:33,477 --> 00:48:35,684
<i>I won! Can you believe it?</i>

1129
00:48:35,879 --> 00:48:37,825
<i>Oh, my gosh!</i>

1130
00:48:38,015 --> 00:48:40,621
<i>That's fantastic! That's fantastic!</i>

1131
00:48:40,817 --> 00:48:42,694
<i>- Daddy won!
- Congrats, Dad!</i>

1132
00:48:42,886 --> 00:48:45,696
<i>So, they're
giving me the award tomorrow night.</i>

1133
00:48:45,889 --> 00:48:46,993
<i>When are you getting here?</i>

1134
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:48,999
<i>You don't know
what's going on here. It's madness.</i>

1135
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:51,502
<i>We can't leave our children
with my parents.</i>

1136
00:48:51,695 --> 00:48:53,902
<i>So, what are you saying?
That you're not coming?</i>

1137
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:56,543
<i>Phil, please listen to me. Try to understand.</i>

1138
00:48:56,733 --> 00:48:57,711
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1139
00:48:57,901 --> 00:49:00,211
<i>Yeah. I understand perfectly.</i>

1140
00:49:00,404 --> 00:49:01,474
<i>All right. Um...</i>

1141
00:49:03,573 --> 00:49:04,881
<i>See you when I get back.</i>

1142
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,626
<i>Okay. We're going home.</i>

1143
00:49:11,815 --> 00:49:12,793
<i>No.</i>

1144
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:14,151
<i>No?</i>

1145
00:49:14,251 --> 00:49:15,355
<i>Artie and the kids are going home.</i>

1146
00:49:15,552 --> 00:49:17,498
<i>I am taking you to the airport.</i>

1147
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:18,393
<i>What?</i>

1148
00:49:18,588 --> 00:49:20,659
<i>Alice, your dad and I have</i>

1149
00:49:20,757 --> 00:49:22,896
<i>bent over backwards
to try to do things your way.</i>

1150
00:49:23,093 --> 00:49:24,902
<i>You haven't bent over at all.</i>

1151
00:49:25,095 --> 00:49:27,234
<i>Oh, I'm bent. Believe me, I'm bent.</i>

1152
00:49:27,431 --> 00:49:28,967
<i>Now, look. You asked us to come here</i>

1153
00:49:29,066 --> 00:49:30,170
<i>and take care of our grandchildren...</i>

1154
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:32,142
<i>and you haven't given
us the chance to do it.</i>

1155
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:34,646
<i>You have been on our backs,
especially your dad's...</i>

1156
00:49:34,838 --> 00:49:35,816
<i>ever since we got here!</i>

1157
00:49:36,006 --> 00:49:39,215
<i>Okay, take his side,
because you always do anyway.</i>

1158
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:40,479
<i>And for a good reason.</i>

1159
00:49:40,677 --> 00:49:42,452
<i>Because after your kids grow up,</i>

1160
00:49:42,612 --> 00:49:44,387
<i>your husband is the one who stays.</i>

1161
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:47,221
<i>Alice, I know
you're trying to be a perfect parent...</i>

1162
00:49:47,417 --> 00:49:49,761
<i>but, honey, there's no such thing.</i>

1163
00:49:49,953 --> 00:49:52,160
<i>And frankly, you need to show Phil...</i>

1164
00:49:52,356 --> 00:49:56,065
<i>he's not just their father,
he's also your husband.</i>

1165
00:49:56,893 --> 00:49:59,601
<i>Alice, I'm your mom.
Take it from me, I really get it.</i>

1166
00:49:59,796 --> 00:50:02,367
<i>"Love the man, love the dream."</i>

1167
00:50:02,566 --> 00:50:04,375
<i>Well, your husband's dream
is coming true...</i>

1168
00:50:04,568 --> 00:50:07,208
<i>and part of that dream
is you being there with him!</i>

1169
00:50:07,404 --> 00:50:09,213
<i>How can you not go?</i>

1170
00:50:09,473 --> 00:50:11,043
<i>Oh, honey, you have to go.</i>

1171
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:13,182
<i>You're going!</i>

1172
00:50:13,577 --> 00:50:14,783
<i>What about my clothes?</i>

1173
00:50:14,878 --> 00:50:16,050
<i>I don't think he wants you in clothes.</i>

1174
00:50:16,246 --> 00:50:17,554
<i>Besides, your luggage is already there.</i>

1175
00:50:17,748 --> 00:50:20,058
<i>Hey, kids, Mommy's finally going.</i>

1176
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:21,627
<i>What about my audition?</i>

1177
00:50:21,818 --> 00:50:23,593
<i>I'll take care of it! It'll be fantastic!</i>

1178
00:50:23,787 --> 00:50:24,959
<i>See you at the ranch.</i>

1179
00:50:25,155 --> 00:50:26,429
<i>Oh. no. Bye!</i>

1180
00:50:26,623 --> 00:50:27,601
<i>This is a happy day-</i>

1181
00:50:27,791 --> 00:50:29,896
<i>Uh, happy day</i>

1182
00:50:31,128 --> 00:50:33,301
<i>Could you drive? I don't feel good.</i>

1183
00:51:00,524 --> 00:51:03,437
<i>Going to stand
there gawking? Going to let me in?</i>

1184
00:51:19,776 --> 00:51:22,347
<i>No score here in the bottom
of the seventh with 2 outs.</i>

1185
00:51:22,546 --> 00:51:25,618
<i>The Giants and the Atlanta
Braves locked into a pitching duel.</i>

1186
00:51:25,816 --> 00:51:27,796
<i>Lincecum and Hudson,
both have been fantastic.</i>

1187
00:51:27,984 --> 00:51:31,591
<i>As Buster Posey steps in,
takes a strike in the inside corner.</i>

1188
00:51:31,788 --> 00:51:34,530
<i>I got to tell you friends,
this is one of those nights...</i>

1189
00:51:34,724 --> 00:51:38,934
<i>72 degrees, 45,000 fans,
smell of the popcorn, the hot dogs...</i>

1190
00:51:39,129 --> 00:51:41,370
<i>all of those clichés,
but I'll tell you something...</i>

1191
00:51:41,565 --> 00:51:43,602
<i>there's no other place I'd rather be.</i>

1192
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,837
<i>Posey hits
a line drive to third and that'll do it.</i>

1193
00:51:46,036 --> 00:51:47,947
<i>That's it, no score through seven.</i>

1194
00:51:48,138 --> 00:51:52,518
<i>We'll be back. This is Artie Decker,
De Voice of the Giants.</i>

1195
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:03,060
<i>No school today.</i>

1196
00:52:03,253 --> 00:52:05,199
<i>You have tickets for the symphony.</i>

1197
00:52:06,723 --> 00:52:08,634
<i>What's wrong with your face?</i>

1198
00:52:08,825 --> 00:52:10,270
<i>Oh, and you're such
a pleasure in the morning?</i>

1199
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:13,202
<i>You're not going to like this.</i>

1200
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:17,467
<i>Barker!</i>

1201
00:52:22,772 --> 00:52:24,149
<i>Ow! Ow! Ow!</i>

1202
00:52:24,908 --> 00:52:25,943
<i>Is it coming off?</i>

1203
00:52:26,042 --> 00:52:27,453
<i>- Well, not exactly.</i>

1204
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:30,181
<i>Sorry, Farty.</i>

1205
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:31,556
<i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

1206
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:36,463
<i>Let's go!</i>

1207
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:38,655
<i>I got to go number two!
I got to go number two!</i>

1208
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:40,460
<i>No, we're already late!</i>

1209
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:42,136
<i>Artie, just take him.</i>

1210
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:44,168
<i>All right. Okay, batter up! Let's go.</i>

1211
00:52:44,361 --> 00:52:47,137
<i>No, no, he can hold it, guys.
He's fine, he can hold it!</i>

1212
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:48,536
<i>The symphony starts at two!</i>

1213
00:52:51,601 --> 00:52:52,579
<i>Quarter?</i>

1214
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:53,739
<i>Not today, thank you.</i>

1215
00:52:54,037 --> 00:52:55,243
<i>Okay.</i>

1216
00:52:55,438 --> 00:52:56,917
<i>- Hey, buddy.
- Sorry!</i>

1217
00:52:58,175 --> 00:52:58,585
<i>So sorry.</i>

1218
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:00,210
<i>That's not human.</i>

1219
00:53:01,444 --> 00:53:03,253
<i>- Hurry up!
- Yeah.</i>

1220
00:53:04,214 --> 00:53:06,023
<i>Okay. Here we go.</i>

1221
00:53:06,216 --> 00:53:07,820
<i>Yeah.</i>

1222
00:53:08,051 --> 00:53:09,155
<i>Okay, there you go.</i>

1223
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:11,389
<i>I can't sit on that.</i>

1224
00:53:11,588 --> 00:53:12,862
<i>I'll give you 10 bucks.</i>

1225
00:53:13,056 --> 00:53:15,093
<i>Daddy always sings to me.</i>

1226
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:17,898
<i>Hmm.</i>

1227
00:53:18,395 --> 00:53:22,366
<i>Come out, come out, Mr. Daodie...</i>

1228
00:53:22,566 --> 00:53:26,275
<i>and swim in the swimming pool</i>

1229
00:53:26,469 --> 00:53:30,417
<i>I know it's dark where you're hiding...</i>

1230
00:53:30,607 --> 00:53:34,555
<i>but out here it's really coal</i>

1231
00:53:37,614 --> 00:53:41,460
<i>Come on, come on, Mr. Daodie...</i>

1232
00:53:41,651 --> 00:53:45,189
<i>'cause we've got something to do</i>

1233
00:53:46,089 --> 00:53:49,229
<i>And if you hurry...</i>

1234
00:53:49,426 --> 00:53:53,568
<i>you 'll meet Carl the kangaroo</i>

1235
00:53:55,332 --> 00:53:56,470
<i>Yes!</i>

1236
00:53:57,334 --> 00:53:59,905
<i>Hey, buddy, can you keep singing?</i>

1237
00:54:01,605 --> 00:54:04,176
<i>Come out, come out, Mr. --</i>

1238
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:07,221
<i>Come on.</i>

1239
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,788
<i>He's still out there! We're okay! We're okay!</i>

1240
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:11,516
<i>Nothing's the matter.</i>

1241
00:54:13,717 --> 00:54:14,787
<i>- Thank you very much.</i>

1242
00:54:14,884 --> 00:54:16,625
<i>This way. Come on, honey.</i>

1243
00:54:20,557 --> 00:54:21,968
<i>Oh, we made it.</i>

1244
00:54:23,526 --> 00:54:26,973
<i>Big crowd. Must be helmet night.</i>

1245
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:31,608
<i>It wasn't that funny.</i>

1246
00:54:55,191 --> 00:54:56,932
<i>Carl and I want to leave.</i>

1247
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:58,299
<i>Don't leave your seat.</i>

1248
00:54:58,495 --> 00:54:59,803
<i>You said "don't."</i>

1249
00:54:59,996 --> 00:55:01,907
<i>Consider the consequences, mister.</i>

1250
00:55:02,098 --> 00:55:03,076
<i>Shh!</i>

1251
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:04,839
<i>It's not me, it's him.</i>

1252
00:55:05,201 --> 00:55:07,442
<i>I'm sorry. Kids.</i>

1253
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:11,452
<i>Barker? Barker?</i>

1254
00:55:14,277 --> 00:55:16,314
<i>Hey, come back here!</i>

1255
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:19,316
<i>Don't go "no". Yes! Get.</i>

1256
00:55:25,789 --> 00:55:27,200
<i>Ow!</i>

1257
00:55:29,626 --> 00:55:31,765
<i>Who brings a child to Tchaikovsky?</i>

1258
00:55:31,961 --> 00:55:34,134
<i>- Me. Voodoo-man. Ha!</i>

1259
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:36,735
<i>Carl, come on!</i>

1260
00:55:38,468 --> 00:55:40,311
<i>- Gr-Grandma?
- Yes, dear?</i>

1261
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:42,540
<i>Artie's ch-chasing Barker.</i>

1262
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:44,582
<i>Oh, that's nice, dear.</i>

1263
00:55:46,142 --> 00:55:47,052
<i>What?</i>

1264
00:55:48,244 --> 00:55:49,746
<i>- Ow!</i>

1265
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:52,458
<i>Excuse me. Excuse me!</i>

1266
00:55:52,649 --> 00:55:55,095
<i>Excuse me. Barker! Get back here!</i>

1267
00:55:55,285 --> 00:55:56,923
<i>- Stop it!
- Barker!</i>

1268
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,258
<i>Oh.my...!</i>

1269
00:55:58,455 --> 00:55:59,900
<i>Where is he?</i>

1270
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:01,763
<i>- Over there!
- Barker!</i>

1271
00:56:01,958 --> 00:56:03,062
<i>Barker!</i>

1272
00:56:03,259 --> 00:56:04,237
<i>Carl!</i>

1273
00:56:05,462 --> 00:56:06,634
<i>Get over here!</i>

1274
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:09,373
<i>Let's see.</i>

1275
00:56:11,568 --> 00:56:12,911
<i>- Artie?
-l'm sorry!</i>

1276
00:56:13,103 --> 00:56:14,480
<i>I can't take this anymore!</i>

1277
00:56:14,671 --> 00:56:17,777
<i>This whole "teachable moments"
and protecting their self-esteem...</i>

1278
00:56:17,974 --> 00:56:19,282
<i>and nobody gets punished!</i>

1279
00:56:19,476 --> 00:56:21,581
<i>And every game ends in a tie!</i>

1280
00:56:22,112 --> 00:56:24,319
<i>All I hear is
"Use your words. Use your words".</i>

1281
00:56:24,514 --> 00:56:27,620
<i>But the word
they never use with these kids is "no"!</i>

1282
00:56:36,659 --> 00:56:38,297
<i>Come on, Mr. Decker.</i>

1283
00:56:38,495 --> 00:56:40,771
<i>The other patients
are waiting for you in Arts and Crafts.</i>

1284
00:56:40,964 --> 00:56:42,443
<i>One second.</i>

1285
00:56:42,632 --> 00:56:44,407
<i>I am very sorry for what happened here.</i>

1286
00:56:44,601 --> 00:56:47,411
<i>Just split it with her.</i>

1287
00:56:47,937 --> 00:56:48,779
<i>Thank you.</i>

1288
00:56:48,972 --> 00:56:50,747
<i>Savages.</i>

1289
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:11,564
<i>Well, he'll be there.</i>

1290
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:13,934
<i>Yeah, Artie Decker.
You're going to love him. He's a pro's pro.</i>

1291
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:16,406
<i>Tomorrow, 11 AM, Piedmont Park.</i>

1292
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:17,942
<i>I'll see-- He'll see you then.</i>

1293
00:57:18,134 --> 00:57:20,273
<i>All right, bye now.</i>

1294
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:22,347
<i>Piedmont Park, map.</i>

1295
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,441
<i>Dinner!</i>

1296
00:57:25,008 --> 00:57:26,112
<i>Who was that?</i>

1297
00:57:26,309 --> 00:57:28,585
<i>Market research.
Always at dinner time. How do they know?</i>

1298
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:32,453
<i>Hey, kids, would you sit down?</i>

1299
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:35,618
<i>I have something I want to clear up.
Something's bothering me.</i>

1300
00:57:35,819 --> 00:57:36,923
<i>I just want to say...</i>

1301
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:40,431
<i>I was never, ever
going to actually spank Barker.</i>

1302
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:42,364
<i>But you threatened to spank him.</i>

1303
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:43,503
<i>But I never was going to do it.</i>

1304
00:57:43,693 --> 00:57:45,695
<i>- But he didn't know that.
- That's why it worked.</i>

1305
00:57:45,895 --> 00:57:46,930
<i>Oh.</i>

1306
00:57:47,063 --> 00:57:49,009
<i>- There we go!
- It looks great!</i>

1307
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:50,177
<i>Thank you, honey.</i>

1308
00:57:50,366 --> 00:57:52,437
<i>Th-This isn't what-what we asked for.</i>

1309
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:55,172
<i>Yes, I know. I got your e-mails. But--</i>

1310
00:57:55,371 --> 00:57:57,317
<i>This is how a family eats.</i>

1311
00:57:57,507 --> 00:58:00,613
<i>We all sit at one table
and we all eat the same thing.</i>

1312
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:02,118
<i>It's not how we eat.</i>

1313
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:03,723
<i>But you know something, Barker...</i>

1314
00:58:03,913 --> 00:58:06,450
<i>Grandma worked very hard
to make your mom's recipe...</i>

1315
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:08,185
<i>just the way that your mom makes it...</i>

1316
00:58:08,384 --> 00:58:11,194
<i>so I think that we owe her the
courtesy of eating it and enjoying it.</i>

1317
00:58:11,454 --> 00:58:14,025
<i>Oh, honey, thank you. That is so sweet.</i>

1318
00:58:18,261 --> 00:58:19,706
<i>I'm going to order a pizza. Who's in?</i>

1319
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:30,215
<i>Hey, you've been sitting here for hours.</i>

1320
00:58:30,406 --> 00:58:32,215
<i>Are you playing a game?</i>

1321
00:58:32,408 --> 00:58:34,319
<i>That looks like fun.
Do you just press it here?</i>

1322
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:35,489
<i>No, no, no!</i>

1323
00:58:35,578 --> 00:58:36,579
<i>Game aver.</i>

1324
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:38,223
<i>-- Ah...</i>

1325
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:40,183
<i>Sorry.</i>

1326
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:42,925
<i>Turner, let me ask you a question.</i>

1327
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:45,600
<i>You ever watch the X Games?
Stuff like that?</i>

1328
00:58:45,788 --> 00:58:46,858
<i>S-S-Sometimes.</i>

1329
00:58:47,056 --> 00:58:48,763
<i>Yeah. Do you think you know the lingo?</i>

1330
00:58:48,958 --> 00:58:53,600
<i>You mean like "h-heinous,"
or "gn-gnarled out," or "n-nose bone"?</i>

1331
00:58:53,796 --> 00:58:54,831
<i>Yeah, that kind of stuff.</i>

1332
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:57,773
<i>Listen, how about later I tuck you
in and we talk more about this?</i>

1333
00:58:57,967 --> 00:59:02,006
<i>S-Sure. Except for the t-tucking in.
I'm eight.</i>

1334
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:03,183
<i>Okay, I get it.</i>

1335
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:06,013
<i>And, listen, I'm sorry
if l embarrassed you the other day.</i>

1336
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:08,052
<i>Wh-Which day was th-that?</i>

1337
00:59:08,778 --> 00:59:10,280
<i>Touché.</i>

1338
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:11,881
<i>One other thing.</i>

1339
00:59:12,081 --> 00:59:15,756
<i>This Ivan kid, he's a punk. Stand up to him.</i>

1340
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:20,096
<i>Anything he starts,
you can finish. Believe in yourself.</i>

1341
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:22,896
<i>And once you believe
in yourself, you can do anything.</i>

1342
00:59:23,092 --> 00:59:25,766
<i>You can look trouble right in the eye
and just wink at it.</i>

1343
00:59:25,962 --> 00:59:28,203
<i>And everything will be okay.
It's all attitude.</i>

1344
00:59:28,598 --> 00:59:30,202
<i>Now, how do you turn this on?</i>

1345
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,311
<i>Th-That's just a t-table.</i>

1346
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:37,543
<i>Okay, let's go.</i>

1347
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:43,418
<i>Goodbye, Harper,
Turner, Barker, Diane and Farty Decker.</i>

1348
00:59:43,613 --> 00:59:44,614
<i>She did that on purpose.</i>

1349
00:59:44,814 --> 00:59:46,555
<i>Remember, you're taking Barker
for a play date.</i>

1350
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:47,784
<i>Okay.</i>

1351
00:59:47,884 --> 00:59:49,761
<i>Alice says this is very,
very important.</i>

1352
00:59:49,953 --> 00:59:50,954
<i>They're still new here...</i>

1353
00:59:51,154 --> 00:59:53,327
<i>and Barker hasn't had
a chance to make new friends, okay?</i>

1354
00:59:53,523 --> 00:59:54,501
<i>I got it.</i>

1355
00:59:54,691 --> 00:59:55,897
<i>Bye, Barker.</i>

1356
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:57,070
<i>Bye.</i>

1357
00:59:57,694 --> 00:59:59,173
<i>Let me ask you something.</i>

1358
00:59:59,629 --> 01:00:00,573
<i>This play date kid, he's imaginary, too?</i>

1359
01:00:01,864 --> 01:00:03,571
<i>- No.
- How will I know how to get there?</i>

1360
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:06,110
<i>Use the R-life.
Turner already punched in the address.</i>

1361
01:00:06,302 --> 01:00:08,680
<i>Okay. Di, can you pick up
Barker after the play date?</i>

1362
01:00:08,871 --> 01:00:10,817
<i>Pick him up? You're supposed
to stay with him the whole time.</i>

1363
01:00:11,007 --> 01:00:12,782
<i>What? When did his play date
become my play date?</i>

1364
01:00:12,976 --> 01:00:14,580
<i>I can't help you! I got to go, hon.</i>

1365
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:15,687
<i>No, I..</i>

1366
01:00:16,212 --> 01:00:17,190
<i>Okay.</i>

1367
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:18,825
<i>- Bye.
- Bye. Have fun!</i>

1368
01:00:19,015 --> 01:00:19,823
<i>Okay.</i>

1369
01:00:20,016 --> 01:00:21,927
<i>All right. Have a good time!</i>

1370
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:24,860
<i>We're going to
have a great time at the play date!</i>

1371
01:00:25,555 --> 01:00:27,034
<i>How would you like to ditch this play date?</i>

1372
01:00:27,223 --> 01:00:29,430
<i>I hate play dates. No one talks to Carl.</i>

1373
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:30,866
<i>Well, how rude are those people?</i>

1374
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:32,869
<i>Would you like to do something fun
with me?</i>

1375
01:00:33,062 --> 01:00:34,666
<i>Great. All right, let's go.</i>

1376
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:37,274
<i>R-life, find me a mall.</i>

1377
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:43,875
<i>Do you guys want to go
to the skate park later?</i>

1378
01:00:44,073 --> 01:00:45,643
<i>I-I-Ivan!</i>

1379
01:00:46,376 --> 01:00:48,879
<i>What do you want, T-T-Turner?</i>

1380
01:00:49,078 --> 01:00:50,216
<i>Listen, p-punk!</i>

1381
01:00:50,413 --> 01:00:52,518
<i>Anything that you start...</i>

1382
01:00:52,715 --> 01:00:54,820
<i>I-I can f-finish!</i>

1383
01:00:57,854 --> 01:01:00,164
<i>We were at our locker and he ran up...</i>

1384
01:01:00,356 --> 01:01:02,893
<i>and it was such an awkward silence.
I had no idea what to say.</i>

1385
01:01:03,092 --> 01:01:04,696
<i>So, are you coming to my party?</i>

1386
01:01:04,894 --> 01:01:07,841
<i>Oh, hi. Oh, I don't think that I can.</i>

1387
01:01:08,031 --> 01:01:09,203
<i>I got to go. See you tonight, I hope.</i>

1388
01:01:09,532 --> 01:01:11,569
<i>Oh, please don't go.</i>

1389
01:01:11,768 --> 01:01:13,509
<i>He so likes you.</i>

1390
01:01:26,416 --> 01:01:28,555
<i>So, Tony, are you
going to bust a 900 today, dude?</i>

1391
01:01:28,751 --> 01:01:31,095
<i>Or are you going show us
something that's going to blow our minds.</i>

1392
01:01:31,287 --> 01:01:32,425
<i>Something we've never seen before?</i>

1393
01:01:32,622 --> 01:01:33,760
<i>I don't know. Maybe I'll try a 900...</i>

1394
01:01:33,956 --> 01:01:36,027
<i>and then give you a tattoo
right in the middle of it.</i>

1395
01:01:36,392 --> 01:01:37,564
<i>Come on! We're late!</i>

1396
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:39,103
<i>But I have to go pee-pee!</i>

1397
01:01:39,295 --> 01:01:41,104
<i>I don't have
a song for that.</i>

1398
01:01:57,447 --> 01:01:58,448
<i>Sorry.</i>

1399
01:01:58,648 --> 01:02:02,653
<i>Talk a little bit about that
particular night and you hitting the 900.</i>

1400
01:02:02,852 --> 01:02:04,456
<i>It wasn't something I planned to do.</i>

1401
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:06,124
<i>It was just I had hit my best...</i>

1402
01:02:06,689 --> 01:02:08,293
<i>I got to go pee!</i>

1403
01:02:10,026 --> 01:02:11,835
<i>How does it feel to be back in Atlanta?</i>

1404
01:02:12,028 --> 01:02:14,838
<i>Hey, I'm here.
Sorry I'm late. Motorcycle trouble.</i>

1405
01:02:15,131 --> 01:02:17,975
<i>I'm Artie "Mad Dog" Decker!
What's up, home slice?</i>

1406
01:02:18,167 --> 01:02:19,145
<i>You're Artie Decker?</i>

1407
01:02:19,335 --> 01:02:20,837
<i>Reporting for duty.</i>

1408
01:02:21,370 --> 01:02:22,348
<i>We up for the same job?</i>

1409
01:02:22,505 --> 01:02:23,483
<i>I hope not.</i>

1410
01:02:23,673 --> 01:02:25,118
<i>Wait a second. You don't know who this is?</i>

1411
01:02:25,541 --> 01:02:26,611
<i>Of course I do.</i>

1412
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:29,512
<i>Dude, this is Tony Hawk, man!</i>

1413
01:02:29,712 --> 01:02:30,816
<i>Yeah, Tony Hawk man. How you doing?</i>

1414
01:02:31,013 --> 01:02:31,991
<i>All right.</i>

1415
01:02:32,181 --> 01:02:33,660
<i>- Who's the kid?
- This is my agent.</i>

1416
01:02:34,183 --> 01:02:35,161
<i>Too many facelifts.</i>

1417
01:02:35,384 --> 01:02:37,762
<i>If he gets one more, he's going back in time.</i>

1418
01:02:39,455 --> 01:02:41,662
<i>I'm going to go take my runs.</i>

1419
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:46,140
<i>So, how do we roll?</i>

1420
01:02:46,329 --> 01:02:47,364
<i>How do we roll?</i>

1421
01:02:47,563 --> 01:02:48,633
<i>Well, we roll this way.</i>

1422
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:50,333
<i>The riders are practicing, so you just</i>

1423
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:51,912
<i>ad lib like it's the actual event.</i>

1424
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:53,375
<i>Just call it like I see it?</i>

1425
01:02:53,569 --> 01:02:55,173
<i>- That's it.
- Okay, dope.</i>

1426
01:02:55,371 --> 01:02:57,044
<i>Hey, can't have a kid up here, man.</i>

1427
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:58,514
<i>No, no, no. Kid's with me. He's fine.</i>

1428
01:02:58,708 --> 01:02:59,550
<i>We're just going to go right over there.</i>

1429
01:02:59,742 --> 01:03:01,722
<i>I promise you,
everything's going to be good.</i>

1430
01:03:04,914 --> 01:03:06,825
<i>You sit right here. Okay?</i>

1431
01:03:07,016 --> 01:03:08,723
<i>Carl and I have to go pee-pee.</i>

1432
01:03:08,918 --> 01:03:09,726
<i>Just give me one minute...</i>

1433
01:03:09,919 --> 01:03:11,830
<i>and I promise
you can do all the peeing that you want.</i>

1434
01:03:12,021 --> 01:03:13,159
<i>- But we really--
- Shh!</i>

1435
01:03:13,356 --> 01:03:14,562
<i>Farty has spoken.</i>

1436
01:03:14,757 --> 01:03:16,668
<i>- Ready?
- Yeah, yeah, coming.</i>

1437
01:03:19,195 --> 01:03:21,197
<i>- Okay.
- Go! Go, go.</i>

1438
01:03:21,397 --> 01:03:22,375
<i>Hello there, everybody!</i>

1439
01:03:22,565 --> 01:03:23,839
<i>It's a beautiful day
and thanks for coming out!</i>

1440
01:03:24,033 --> 01:03:25,103
<i>- Here's one--
Cut!</i>

1441
01:03:25,301 --> 01:03:27,110
<i>- What?
- He's finished. The run's over.</i>

1442
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:28,911
<i>Oh. All right. Uh...</i>

1443
01:03:29,572 --> 01:03:31,051
<i>Give me one more chance.
I'm just warming up.</i>

1444
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:32,878
<i>Hey, even Sinatra cleared his throat.</i>

1445
01:03:33,075 --> 01:03:34,281
<i>All right, pops, come on. Try to keep up.</i>

1446
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:36,115
<i>Ready? Three, two...</i>

1447
01:03:39,448 --> 01:03:41,052
<i>It is on
and it is epic.</i>

1448
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:43,526
<i>We're expecting to see
a front side heel flip 540...</i>

1449
01:03:43,719 --> 01:03:46,893
<i>990 body varial with a Cab 7 Melon Grab.</i>

1450
01:03:47,089 --> 01:03:48,500
<i>Melon Grab, my cousin got arrested</i>

1451
01:03:48,591 --> 01:03:49,399
<i>on the subway for melon-grabbing.</i>

1452
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:56,567
<i>Tony started when he was very young.</i>

1453
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:58,202
<i>He actually skated out of his mother.</i>

1454
01:03:58,401 --> 01:03:59,471
<i>Can I ask you something?
I wonder about this.</i>

1455
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:01,410
<i>- Absolutely.
- How do you practice these tricks...</i>

1456
01:04:01,604 --> 01:04:02,639
<i>before you get really good at them?</i>

1457
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:06,252
<i>Do you say, "I'm just
going to do this. Somebody get a mop"?</i>

1458
01:04:06,442 --> 01:04:08,285
<i>Wait. Is that a kid on the half-pipe?</i>

1459
01:04:08,578 --> 01:04:09,579
<i>Barker!</i>

1460
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:11,781
<i>Barker!</i>

1461
01:04:14,617 --> 01:04:15,925
<i>Barker, what are you doing?</i>

1462
01:04:16,452 --> 01:04:17,988
<i>I told you I had to pee.</i>

1463
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:19,325
<i>ls all that coming out of you?</i>

1464
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:21,559
<i>- I saved it up.
- When? Since birth?</i>

1465
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:44,115
<i>What you did back there
was pretty dangerous.</i>

1466
01:04:44,313 --> 01:04:45,121
<i>Do you know that?</i>

1467
01:04:45,314 --> 01:04:46,850
<i>Carl told me to do it.</i>

1468
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:51,130
<i>I don't think Carl is being
a very good friend to you.</i>

1469
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:53,823
<i>For a kangaroo,
he's something of a thrill-seeker.</i>

1470
01:04:54,023 --> 01:04:57,527
<i>And I think it's time
that you start telling Carl what to do.</i>

1471
01:04:58,027 --> 01:04:59,165
<i>One other thing.</i>

1472
01:04:59,996 --> 01:05:01,498
<i>I was supposed to...</i>

1473
01:05:02,198 --> 01:05:05,645
<i>watch after you today,
and I didn't do a good job.</i>

1474
01:05:06,936 --> 01:05:08,040
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1475
01:05:08,671 --> 01:05:12,050
<i>So, Farty would appreciate it...</i>

1476
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:14,084
<i>if when we get home...</i>

1477
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:17,717
<i>you don't tell
anyone what happened. Okay?</i>

1478
01:05:18,514 --> 01:05:19,993
<i>Twenty bucks.</i>

1479
01:05:21,284 --> 01:05:22,092
<i>Deal.</i>

1480
01:05:22,518 --> 01:05:24,259
<i>Let's go home. Come on.</i>

1481
01:05:29,625 --> 01:05:31,366
<i>Carl, come on.</i>

1482
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:35,702
<i>- How could you?
- What?</i>

1483
01:05:35,898 --> 01:05:36,876
<i>You think I don't know?</i>

1484
01:05:37,066 --> 01:05:38,272
<i>I want my 20 bucks back.</i>

1485
01:05:38,467 --> 01:05:39,673
<i>He's just a little boy!</i>

1486
01:05:39,869 --> 01:05:40,847
<i>He's fine.</i>

1487
01:05:41,037 --> 01:05:43,017
<i>Fine? Take a look at him.</i>

1488
01:05:43,205 --> 01:05:45,014
<i>Not him. Turner.</i>

1489
01:05:45,207 --> 01:05:46,185
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

1490
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:50,221
<i>I'm talking about Turner
and that brilliant advice you gave him.</i>

1491
01:05:53,582 --> 01:05:54,652
<i>Hey.</i>

1492
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:00,600
<i>I have to ask, did you hit him back?</i>

1493
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:02,701
<i>- No.
- Why not?</i>

1494
01:06:02,892 --> 01:06:04,701
<i>B-Because I hit him f-first.</i>

1495
01:06:04,894 --> 01:06:06,168
<i>Oh. Then he--</i>

1496
01:06:06,362 --> 01:06:09,036
<i>He started screaming
and s-someone helped him fight me.</i>

1497
01:06:09,231 --> 01:06:10,904
<i>Two against one? How big was this other--</i>

1498
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:12,704
<i>It was his little sister.</i>

1499
01:06:12,902 --> 01:06:13,903
<i>She did this.</i>

1500
01:06:14,403 --> 01:06:16,405
<i>Turner, this is all my fault.</i>

1501
01:06:17,073 --> 01:06:19,576
<i>When I said stand
up for yourself, I didn't mean hitting.</i>

1502
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:21,117
<i>All right, listen.</i>

1503
01:06:21,577 --> 01:06:25,047
<i>Oh, boy. The older I get,
the lower the floor gets.</i>

1504
01:06:26,582 --> 01:06:29,085
<i>Turner, can I share something with you?</i>

1505
01:06:29,285 --> 01:06:31,697
<i>Just between me and you.
No one else knows this.</i>

1506
01:06:31,887 --> 01:06:33,389
<i>This is just two guys talking.</i>

1507
01:06:33,589 --> 01:06:37,196
<i>When I was your age,
I was very shy because I was short.</i>

1508
01:06:37,393 --> 01:06:38,872
<i>I didn't talk to anybody.</i>

1509
01:06:39,061 --> 01:06:40,472
<i>And my self-esteem...</i>

1510
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:44,941
<i>You know, the way
I feel about myself, was really bad.</i>

1511
01:06:45,134 --> 01:06:46,408
<i>Do you ever feel that way?</i>

1512
01:06:47,470 --> 01:06:49,973
<i>Yeah? Well, you know what? You shouldn't.</i>

1513
01:06:50,172 --> 01:06:51,742
<i>Because you're a great kid.</i>

1514
01:06:52,575 --> 01:06:54,987
<i>All right, I want to play you something.</i>

1515
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:57,453
<i>Hey, house, I want to play something.</i>

1516
01:06:58,014 --> 01:06:59,322
<i>Okay.</i>

1517
01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:02,722
<i>Oh. Okay.</i>

1518
01:07:03,953 --> 01:07:05,830
<i>Now, the first time I heard this...</i>

1519
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:09,162
<i>I knew right away that I had found my voice.</i>

1520
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:12,305
<i>I knew that I had to become
a baseball announcer.</i>

1521
01:07:12,495 --> 01:07:13,303
<i>And once I knew that...</i>

1522
01:07:13,496 --> 01:07:15,772
<i>it didn't matter what anybody
else thought or said about me.</i>

1523
01:07:15,965 --> 01:07:18,172
<i>Sh-sh-shot heard round the w-world?</i>

1524
01:07:18,367 --> 01:07:20,677
<i>Right. The shot heard round the world.</i>

1525
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:21,848
<i>Let me tell you about it.</i>

1526
01:07:25,107 --> 01:07:27,644
<i>It's 1951. Long time ago.</i>

1527
01:07:27,843 --> 01:07:30,153
<i>Brooklyn Dodgers,
New York Giants.</i>

1528
01:07:30,346 --> 01:07:31,825
<i>And they hated each other.</i>

1529
01:07:32,014 --> 01:07:34,324
<i>L-Like Luke S-Skywalker and D-Darth Vader.</i>

1530
01:07:34,517 --> 01:07:35,495
<i>Worse.</i>

1531
01:07:35,684 --> 01:07:38,597
<i>Well, the baseball season ends
and they're tied.</i>

1532
01:07:38,788 --> 01:07:40,358
<i>Now, this one game would decide...</i>

1533
01:07:40,556 --> 01:07:42,058
<i>who would go to the World Series</i>

1534
01:07:42,158 --> 01:07:43,637
<i>against the great New York Yankees.</i>

1535
01:07:43,826 --> 01:07:45,703
<i>Biggest game in the history of New York.</i>

1536
01:07:46,462 --> 01:07:48,100
<i>Bottom of the ninth inning, two outs,</i>

1537
01:07:48,197 --> 01:07:49,801
<i>the Giants are losing 4 to 2...</i>

1538
01:07:49,999 --> 01:07:52,570
<i>and a batter
named Bobby Thomson comes up to bat.</i>

1539
01:07:53,969 --> 01:07:56,415
<i>Bobby Thomson
up there swinging.</i>

1540
01:07:56,605 --> 01:07:57,640
<i>He '5 had two out of three,</i>

1541
01:07:57,773 --> 01:07:58,979
<i>a single and a double, and Billy Cox is--</i>

1542
01:07:59,175 --> 01:08:01,781
<i>Close your eyes. Close your eyes, come on.</i>

1543
01:08:01,977 --> 01:08:04,787
<i>Close your eyes and you can see it.</i>

1544
01:08:05,314 --> 01:08:06,987
<i>Bobby hitting at .292.</i>

1545
01:08:07,183 --> 01:08:08,787
<i>Lock man without
too big of a lead at second“</i>

1546
01:08:08,984 --> 01:08:11,021
<i>but he 'll be running like the wind
if Thomson hits one.</i>

1547
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:12,198
<i>Branca throws.</i>

1548
01:08:12,388 --> 01:08:15,028
<i>There's a long drive!
It's going to be, I believe--</i>

1549
01:08:15,224 --> 01:08:16,828
<i>The Giants win the pennant!</i>

1550
01:08:17,026 --> 01:08:20,371
<i>The Giants win the pennant!
The Giants win the pennant!</i>

1551
01:08:20,629 --> 01:08:22,165
<i>The Giants win the pennant!</i>

1552
01:08:22,364 --> 01:08:26,005
<i>Bobby Thomson hits
into the lower deck of the left field stands!</i>

1553
01:08:26,202 --> 01:08:27,613
<i>The Giants win the pennant...</i>

1554
01:08:27,803 --> 01:08:30,647
<i>and they're going crazy, they're going crazy!</i>

1555
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:32,786
<i>And home!</i>

1556
01:08:33,309 --> 01:08:34,447
<i>I don't believe it!</i>

1557
01:08:34,643 --> 01:08:35,986
<i>I do not believe it!</i>

1558
01:08:36,178 --> 01:08:40,058
<i>The Giants won it by a score of 5 to 4...</i>

1559
01:08:40,249 --> 01:08:42,525
<i>and they're picking Bobby Thomson up“</i>

1560
01:08:42,718 --> 01:08:44,322
<i>and carrying him off the field!</i>

1561
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:46,693
<i>That's what gave me my dream.</i>

1562
01:08:46,889 --> 01:08:49,233
<i>Now the big dream,
of course, was to announce for the Giants.</i>

1563
01:08:49,425 --> 01:08:50,403
<i>D-Did you?</i>

1564
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:53,365
<i>No. But--.</i>

1565
01:08:53,562 --> 01:08:54,905
<i>Y-You still might?</i>

1566
01:08:56,765 --> 01:08:58,073
<i>You never know.</i>

1567
01:08:58,701 --> 01:09:00,544
<i>C-C-Can I h-hear it again?</i>

1568
01:09:01,537 --> 01:09:02,675
<i>Sure.</i>

1569
01:09:04,206 --> 01:09:06,550
<i>Bobby Thomson
up there swinging.</i>

1570
01:09:06,742 --> 01:09:07,948
<i>He '5 had two out of three,</i>

1571
01:09:08,043 --> 01:09:09,454
<i>a single and a double,
and Billy Cox is playing--</i>

1572
01:09:15,551 --> 01:09:18,225
<i>Honey, we're going to play a
game. You want to join us?</i>

1573
01:09:18,454 --> 01:09:20,365
<i>- Grandma, I can't.
- Why?</i>

1574
01:09:20,556 --> 01:09:22,035
<i>Because if l don't do well tomorrow...</i>

1575
01:09:22,224 --> 01:09:23,999
<i>then I won't get into
the Atlanta Youth Symphony...</i>

1576
01:09:24,193 --> 01:09:25,365
<i>which is a feeder for Juilliard...</i>

1577
01:09:25,561 --> 01:09:27,404
<i>which offers a graduate class
with Sarah Chang...</i>

1578
01:09:27,596 --> 01:09:29,667
<i>whose students are virtually guaranteed</i>

1579
01:09:29,765 --> 01:09:31,005
<i>to get into the Berlin Philharmonic...</i>

1580
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:32,941
<i>which is the orchestra
I most want to play in.</i>

1581
01:09:33,269 --> 01:09:34,247
<i>- Sweetheart.
- Yes.</i>

1582
01:09:34,436 --> 01:09:35,540
<i>Berlin's not going anywhere.</i>

1583
01:09:35,738 --> 01:09:37,911
<i>Well, neither am I if l don't practice.</i>

1584
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:41,387
<i>Okay, I'll tell the boys. But you're sure now?</i>

1585
01:09:41,577 --> 01:09:42,453
<i>Yes.</i>

1586
01:09:42,645 --> 01:09:44,124
<i>Okay.</i>

1587
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:49,359
<i>Gentlemen, the game is called Kick the Can.</i>

1588
01:09:49,552 --> 01:09:51,054
<i>Are you going to recycle that?</i>

1589
01:09:51,253 --> 01:09:53,324
<i>I-It's d-dirty out here.</i>

1590
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:54,660
<i>And windy!</i>

1591
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:56,894
<i>I know. It's called "outside."</i>

1592
01:09:57,393 --> 01:09:59,031
<i>Is she coming?</i>

1593
01:09:59,562 --> 01:10:00,597
<i>Oh, too bad.</i>

1594
01:10:00,796 --> 01:10:02,935
<i>All right, guys, the object of the game,</i>

1595
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:05,103
<i>kick the can without getting tagged!</i>

1596
01:10:05,301 --> 01:10:06,746
<i>Okay, here we go!</i>

1597
01:10:06,936 --> 01:10:08,415
<i>Come on!</i>

1598
01:10:08,604 --> 01:10:09,844
<i>Kick... Come on.</i>

1599
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:11,712
<i>S-Sounds b-boring.</i>

1600
01:10:11,907 --> 01:10:13,011
<i>Boring?</i>

1601
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:14,449
<i>Oh. yeah?</i>

1602
01:10:14,643 --> 01:10:16,919
<i>Who wants a chance to clobber old Artie?</i>

1603
01:10:17,112 --> 01:10:17,920
<i>Right.</i>

1604
01:10:18,581 --> 01:10:20,424
<i>- And then see him eat dirt!</i>

1605
01:10:20,749 --> 01:10:22,194
<i>And then kick the can so hard...</i>

1606
01:10:22,384 --> 01:10:24,364
<i>it goes in one ear and out the other!</i>

1607
01:10:25,454 --> 01:10:26,956
<i>I do! I do!</i>

1608
01:10:27,156 --> 01:10:28,635
<i>I do!</i>

1609
01:10:28,824 --> 01:10:29,859
<i>-- In my ear?</i>

1610
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:31,367
<i>Out of my way, Farty.</i>

1611
01:10:32,494 --> 01:10:33,336
<i>Over here!</i>

1612
01:10:33,529 --> 01:10:34,507
<i>Good kick!</i>

1613
01:10:34,697 --> 01:10:35,801
<i>Turner, it's mine!</i>

1614
01:10:39,535 --> 01:10:40,707
<i>I got it, I got it!</i>

1615
01:10:40,803 --> 01:10:42,908
<i>Look out for me, I'm Super Artie!</i>

1616
01:10:44,773 --> 01:10:45,751
<i>Watch it, watch it!</i>

1617
01:10:46,709 --> 01:10:47,744
<i>Pass me the can!</i>

1618
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:49,147
<i>Over here.</i>

1619
01:10:50,179 --> 01:10:51,487
<i>Farty!</i>

1620
01:10:54,283 --> 01:10:55,819
<i>- Well!</i>

1621
01:10:56,018 --> 01:10:57,554
<i>Okay. Let the games begin!</i>

1622
01:11:08,797 --> 01:11:09,901
<i>Come on!</i>

1623
01:11:35,324 --> 01:11:36,359
<i>- Ah!
- Ooh!</i>

1624
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:52,344
<i>Are you okay?</i>

1625
01:11:52,441 --> 01:11:53,476
<i>I'm fine.</i>

1626
01:11:53,676 --> 01:11:55,713
<i>You should see the other guy!</i>

1627
01:11:59,348 --> 01:12:00,986
<i>- I got more ice.
- Oh, thank you, honey.</i>

1628
01:12:01,183 --> 01:12:02,594
<i>It should be stopping soon.</i>

1629
01:12:02,785 --> 01:12:04,093
<i>I should start dinner.</i>

1630
01:12:04,286 --> 01:12:05,356
<i>Grandma?</i>

1631
01:12:05,454 --> 01:12:06,455
<i>Yes, dear?</i>

1632
01:12:07,523 --> 01:12:10,003
<i>I know my
audition is tomorrow, but I practiced all day.</i>

1633
01:12:10,192 --> 01:12:11,933
<i>And you said I should relax
the night before...</i>

1634
01:12:12,127 --> 01:12:13,936
<i>and there's this party tonight.</i>

1635
01:12:14,129 --> 01:12:15,802
<i>It's the first party
I've been invited to since we moved.</i>

1636
01:12:15,998 --> 01:12:17,306
<i>What if I just went for a half an hour...</i>

1637
01:12:17,499 --> 01:12:19,479
<i>came right back home,
got a really good night's sleep?</i>

1638
01:12:19,668 --> 01:12:20,976
<i>What kind of a party?</i>

1639
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:23,141
<i>Just this party for some boy.</i>

1640
01:12:25,107 --> 01:12:26,085
<i>He kind of likes me.</i>

1641
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:28,746
<i>I'll do your make-up!</i>

1642
01:12:29,478 --> 01:12:30,616
<i>Oh!</i>

1643
01:12:39,988 --> 01:12:41,126
<i>I wish we could stay.</i>

1644
01:12:41,323 --> 01:12:43,234
<i>Yeah, we should do this, like--</i>

1645
01:12:43,425 --> 01:12:44,267
<i>Yeah, like...</i>

1646
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:46,235
<i>- Every week?
- Yes.</i>

1647
01:12:46,428 --> 01:12:48,635
<i>The child
that was involved was not injured.</i>

1648
01:12:48,831 --> 01:12:50,276
<i>Take a look and a listen to this.</i>

1649
01:12:50,466 --> 01:12:52,673
<i>It was scary. I was about to nail this 900...</i>

1650
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:55,610
<i>and ti? ere '5 this kid up ti? ere
just whizzing a way.</i>

1651
01:12:55,804 --> 01:12:58,478
<i>I hit his stream
and l fishtailed, and now it's on YouTube.</i>

1652
01:12:58,674 --> 01:13:00,950
<i>It's got more hits than Charlie the Unicorn.</i>

1653
01:13:01,143 --> 01:13:03,646
<i>And when l asked what he was
doing, you know what he said?</i>

1654
01:13:03,846 --> 01:13:06,759
<i>"I was chasing Carl, my kangaroo. "</i>

1655
01:13:06,949 --> 01:13:08,792
<i>That's one twisted little dude.</i>

1656
01:13:08,984 --> 01:13:13,091
<i>This is from Tony Hawk's practice
run this morning at the X Games.</i>

1657
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:15,031
<i>And you know, it kind of begs the question...</i>

1658
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:17,101
<i>what kind of parent would let their child</i>

1659
01:13:17,192 --> 01:13:19,638
<i>wander out onto the half-pipe?</i>

1660
01:13:28,065 --> 01:13:28,941
<i>Hey!</i>

1661
01:13:29,567 --> 01:13:30,807
<i>How is this for bonding?</i>

1662
01:13:31,002 --> 01:13:32,208
<i>I taught them how to shave.</i>

1663
01:13:32,537 --> 01:13:34,778
<i>Yeah. Show her your legs, boys.</i>

1664
01:13:35,540 --> 01:13:37,110
<i>That's great!</i>

1665
01:13:37,308 --> 01:13:41,051
<i>And guess what? I ordered
Chinese“ I mean, Pan Asian, for dinner.</i>

1666
01:13:42,580 --> 01:13:43,650
<i>Noodles!</i>

1667
01:13:43,848 --> 01:13:45,191
<i>All right, go upstairs and change.</i>

1668
01:13:45,383 --> 01:13:47,556
<i>When you come down,
we're going to arm-wrestle Grandma.</i>

1669
01:13:49,687 --> 01:13:51,132
<i>How come we just had one?</i>

1670
01:13:51,322 --> 01:13:52,460
<i>- It's not too late.
- Oh!</i>

1671
01:13:52,657 --> 01:13:55,035
<i>It's really late. Come here,
I want to show you something.</i>

1672
01:13:55,226 --> 01:13:57,172
<i>- What?
- Look at this.</i>

1673
01:13:57,361 --> 01:13:59,136
<i>- That's Alice's song.
- Yeah.</i>

1674
01:13:59,330 --> 01:14:01,173
<i>She was, like, three or four years
old, how did she remember?</i>

1675
01:14:01,365 --> 01:14:03,845
<i>I don't know,
but it's at the top of her playlist.</i>

1676
01:14:04,035 --> 01:14:05,241
<i>- Wow.
- Aw!</i>

1677
01:14:06,003 --> 01:14:09,416
<i>We must have sang that song
a thousand times to her in the car!</i>

1678
01:14:09,607 --> 01:14:11,314
<i>- You know you want to.
- I don't want to sing it.</i>

1679
01:14:11,509 --> 01:14:14,649
<i>Oh, I wonder, wonder,
whom-ba-doo-hoo-whom</i>

1680
01:14:15,213 --> 01:14:18,251
<i>Who wrote the book of love?</i>

1681
01:14:18,449 --> 01:14:22,488
<i>Tell me, tell me, tell me
Oh, who wrote the book of love?</i>

1682
01:14:22,687 --> 01:14:26,567
<i>l got to know the answer
was it someone from above?</i>

1683
01:14:26,757 --> 01:14:29,795
<i>Oh, I wonder, wonder,
whom ba-doo-hoo-whom.</i>

1684
01:14:30,428 --> 01:14:31,839
<i>Who wrote the book of love?</i>

1685
01:14:32,029 --> 01:14:33,804
<i>What is that?</i>

1686
01:14:33,998 --> 01:14:36,035
<i>Chapter one says you leave her,</i>

1687
01:14:36,133 --> 01:14:38,135
<i>you love her with all your heart</i>

1688
01:14:38,336 --> 01:14:40,213
<i>Chapter two, you tell her...</i>

1689
01:14:40,404 --> 01:14:42,315
<i>you're never
never never never ever going to part</i>

1690
01:14:42,507 --> 01:14:44,578
<i>And chapter three, remember...</i>

1691
01:14:44,775 --> 01:14:46,584
<i>the meaning of romance</i>

1692
01:14:46,777 --> 01:14:48,586
<i>And chapter four, you break up</i>

1693
01:14:48,779 --> 01:14:50,554
<i>But you give her just one more chance</i>

1694
01:14:50,748 --> 01:14:54,389
<i>Oh, I wonder, wonder,
whom-ba-doo-hoo-whom</i>

1695
01:14:54,585 --> 01:14:57,498
<i>Who wrote the book of love?</i>

1696
01:14:57,755 --> 01:15:01,066
<i>I wonder who</i>

1697
01:15:01,259 --> 01:15:02,169
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1698
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:07,334
<i>Who wrote the book of love?</i>

1699
01:15:09,433 --> 01:15:11,379
<i>Thank you.</i>

1700
01:15:12,803 --> 01:15:13,338
<i>Grandma?</i>

1701
01:15:13,538 --> 01:15:15,415
<i>We're down here.</i>

1702
01:15:17,508 --> 01:15:18,885
<i>- Oh!
- Oh, boy.</i>

1703
01:15:19,076 --> 01:15:21,386
<i>Oh, Harper. Oh, this is great.</i>

1704
01:15:22,046 --> 01:15:23,024
<i>Wait, my camera.</i>

1705
01:15:23,214 --> 01:15:24,454
<i>Okay.</i>

1706
01:15:26,284 --> 01:15:27,354
<i>Oh.</i>

1707
01:15:27,985 --> 01:15:30,192
<i>Oh, honey, you look so great!</i>

1708
01:15:31,722 --> 01:15:32,530
<i>Thank you.</i>

1709
01:15:32,723 --> 01:15:33,701
<i>You look so beautiful.</i>

1710
01:15:33,891 --> 01:15:35,700
<i>Artie, what do you think
of your granddaughter now?</i>

1711
01:15:35,893 --> 01:15:37,634
<i>- Wow. Ooh.
- Oh!</i>

1712
01:15:38,296 --> 01:15:39,604
<i>-- Whoa!</i>

1713
01:15:40,331 --> 01:15:41,810
<i>Doesn't she look like her mom, huh?</i>

1714
01:15:41,999 --> 01:15:43,444
<i>Just like her mom.</i>

1715
01:15:44,635 --> 01:15:46,114
<i>Hey, it stopped raining.</i>

1716
01:15:46,304 --> 01:15:49,148
<i>Carl says we should go outside
and play again!</i>

1717
01:15:49,340 --> 01:15:51,081
<i>Oh, no, Barker, it's too muddy.</i>

1718
01:15:51,275 --> 01:15:52,879
<i>But he wants to.</i>

1719
01:15:53,077 --> 01:15:55,421
<i>Barker, remember what we talked about?</i>

1720
01:15:55,780 --> 01:15:58,989
<i>You're the boss of Carl.
You tell him what to do.</i>

1721
01:16:02,019 --> 01:16:03,555
<i>We can't go out now, Carl.</i>

1722
01:16:05,122 --> 01:16:06,726
<i>Carl, no!</i>

1723
01:16:07,058 --> 01:16:08,628
<i>- Stop!
- What's wrong?</i>

1724
01:16:08,826 --> 01:16:11,966
<i>He ran away.
He said he's never coming back.</i>

1725
01:16:12,163 --> 01:16:14,109
<i>Oh, he'll come back.
He has to pick up his mail.</i>

1726
01:16:14,298 --> 01:16:15,436
<i>Yeah, mail.</i>

1727
01:16:15,533 --> 01:16:16,739
<i>Makes sense.</i>

1728
01:16:18,669 --> 01:16:20,114
<i>- Barker!
- Carl!</i>

1729
01:16:20,204 --> 01:16:21,148
<i>-- Artie, get him.</i>

1730
01:16:21,238 --> 01:16:23,115
<i>Barker has left without adult supervision.</i>

1731
01:16:23,307 --> 01:16:25,412
<i>Carl, don't go!</i>

1732
01:16:26,410 --> 01:16:27,388
<i>Barker!</i>

1733
01:16:27,478 --> 01:16:28,479
<i>Goodbye, Artie Decker.</i>

1734
01:16:28,579 --> 01:16:29,751
<i>Barker!</i>

1735
01:16:37,989 --> 01:16:39,798
<i>How many heart attacks can you give me?</i>

1736
01:16:40,157 --> 01:16:41,135
<i>Oh, no, no, no!</i>

1737
01:16:41,325 --> 01:16:42,736
<i>- Barker, are you okay?
- He's fine.</i>

1738
01:16:44,095 --> 01:16:45,165
<i>What, are you hurt?</i>

1739
01:16:45,363 --> 01:16:47,104
<i>Look, can't you see?</i>

1740
01:16:47,365 --> 01:16:50,437
<i>He's dead, the car killed him! Carl is dead!</i>

1741
01:16:50,635 --> 01:16:53,138
<i>What? No! I killed Carl?</i>

1742
01:16:53,504 --> 01:16:55,347
<i>Oh, honey, he's fine. He's just dazed.</i>

1743
01:16:55,539 --> 01:16:57,075
<i>Yeah, yeah. Carl, you're okay, aren't you?</i>

1744
01:16:57,274 --> 01:16:58,844
<i>Yeah, I'm all right, mate. I'm all right!</i>

1745
01:16:59,043 --> 01:17:00,852
<i>- That wasn't Carl, that was you!
- Shut up!</i>

1746
01:17:01,045 --> 01:17:02,524
<i>No, he's not all right!</i>

1747
01:17:02,947 --> 01:17:05,450
<i>He's dead! He's mashed all over the road.</i>

1748
01:17:05,650 --> 01:17:08,187
<i>His head is here and his body's over there!</i>

1749
01:17:08,386 --> 01:17:12,198
<i>It's your fault! You made me get
into a fight with him!</i>

1750
01:17:12,390 --> 01:17:14,392
<i>We are so past weird.</i>

1751
01:17:15,559 --> 01:17:17,004
<i>I love Carl!</i>

1752
01:17:17,194 --> 01:17:19,333
<i>I even pack extra fortune cookies for him!</i>

1753
01:17:19,530 --> 01:17:21,601
<i>Excuse me, what's Chinese for mental case?</i>

1754
01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:24,038
<i>Hello?</i>

1755
01:17:30,741 --> 01:17:32,721
<i>We were cruising
and heard the alarm. ls everyone okay?</i>

1756
01:17:32,910 --> 01:17:33,650
<i>Yes.</i>

1757
01:17:33,844 --> 01:17:36,552
<i>No, he's dead! The car killed him!</i>

1758
01:17:36,747 --> 01:17:38,624
<i>He came out of nowhere!</i>

1759
01:17:38,816 --> 01:17:40,489
<i>Officer, you're wasting your time.</i>

1760
01:17:40,685 --> 01:17:42,187
<i>What happened? Why are the police here?</i>

1761
01:17:42,386 --> 01:17:43,694
<i>Why is the alarm on?</i>

1762
01:17:43,888 --> 01:17:45,128
<i>- Oh, hi!
- Mommy!</i>

1763
01:17:45,322 --> 01:17:46,596
<i>- Was there a break-in?
- It's nothing.</i>

1764
01:17:46,791 --> 01:17:49,829
<i>It's absolutely nothing.
What are you doing home?</i>

1765
01:17:50,027 --> 01:17:51,165
<i>I killed Carl!</i>

1766
01:17:51,362 --> 01:17:53,137
<i>- What?
- You killed Carl? How?</i>

1767
01:17:53,330 --> 01:17:55,503
<i>Who is Carl? Is he a family member?</i>

1768
01:17:55,700 --> 01:17:56,542
<i>- Yes!
- No!</i>

1769
01:17:56,734 --> 01:17:58,372
<i>He's a kangaroo!</i>

1770
01:17:58,569 --> 01:17:59,479
<i>He's a what?</i>

1771
01:17:59,670 --> 01:18:00,808
<i>Turner, your eye!</i>

1772
01:18:01,005 --> 01:18:02,177
<i>How did that happen?</i>

1773
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:03,818
<i>Artie did it?</i>

1774
01:18:04,041 --> 01:18:07,545
<i>Oh, no, no, no. lvan's sister did it. I did that.</i>

1775
01:18:07,745 --> 01:18:08,723
<i>You hit Mom?</i>

1776
01:18:08,813 --> 01:18:09,848
<i>It was an accident!</i>

1777
01:18:10,047 --> 01:18:11,287
<i>Ma'am, would you like to file a complaint?</i>

1778
01:18:11,482 --> 01:18:12,483
<i>No!</i>

1779
01:18:12,583 --> 01:18:13,653
<i>We were playing a game.</i>

1780
01:18:13,751 --> 01:18:15,230
<i>That's the dress.</i>

1781
01:18:15,419 --> 01:18:16,659
<i>Does she have make-up on?</i>

1782
01:18:17,922 --> 01:18:19,162
<i>Don't growl at us.</i>

1783
01:18:19,356 --> 01:18:20,164
<i>This is unbelievable.</i>

1784
01:18:20,357 --> 01:18:22,530
<i>We leave and she's 12,
we come home and she's 16.</i>

1785
01:18:22,893 --> 01:18:23,871
<i>Boys, go in the house.</i>

1786
01:18:24,061 --> 01:18:25,631
<i>Turner, turn off the alarm, please.</i>

1787
01:18:25,830 --> 01:18:27,537
<i>You know, you're not supposed
to be back until tomorrow.</i>

1788
01:18:27,732 --> 01:18:29,473
<i>Well, we were just so curious...</i>

1789
01:18:29,667 --> 01:18:32,671
<i>as to why Barker was nearly
killed this morning at the X Games!</i>

1790
01:18:32,870 --> 01:18:34,474
<i>Uh-oh! Get your taser ready.</i>

1791
01:18:35,372 --> 01:18:36,350
<i>That's not right.</i>

1792
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:38,645
<i>Barker was at a play date
this morning with Artie.</i>

1793
01:18:38,843 --> 01:18:39,753
<i>Oh. yeah?</i>

1794
01:18:43,447 --> 01:18:45,484
<i>I was in a little bind...</i>

1795
01:18:45,683 --> 01:18:47,993
<i>and I had to take him
with me on some business.</i>

1796
01:18:48,185 --> 01:18:49,926
<i>What business did you have
at the X Games?</i>

1797
01:18:50,121 --> 01:18:52,101
<i>Yeah, Artie, what business?</i>

1798
01:18:57,228 --> 01:18:58,366
<i>Um...</i>

1799
01:18:59,563 --> 01:19:01,600
<i>Aren't we forgetting
the most serious issue here?</i>

1800
01:19:01,799 --> 01:19:02,834
<i>What issue?</i>

1801
01:19:02,933 --> 01:19:05,209
<i>The death of an imaginary kangaroo.</i>

1802
01:19:05,402 --> 01:19:06,403
<i>He's imaginary?</i>

1803
01:19:06,604 --> 01:19:07,582
<i>Yes!</i>

1804
01:19:09,774 --> 01:19:10,752
<i>You can go.</i>

1805
01:19:15,713 --> 01:19:18,216
<i>Would someone please explain
what happened to Carl?</i>

1806
01:19:18,415 --> 01:19:19,621
<i>We were playing Kick the Can...</i>

1807
01:19:19,817 --> 01:19:22,093
<i>and it started to rain,
so we all came indoors...</i>

1808
01:19:22,286 --> 01:19:24,789
<i>and I was helping
Harper get dressed for her party.</i>

1809
01:19:24,989 --> 01:19:26,935
<i>A party? You're throwing a party?</i>

1810
01:19:27,124 --> 01:19:27,924
<i>No, Dad, I'm going to a party.</i>

1811
01:19:27,925 --> 01:19:28,528
<i>No, Dad, I'm going to a party.</i>

1812
01:19:28,726 --> 01:19:29,704
<i>For a boy who likes her.</i>

1813
01:19:29,894 --> 01:19:31,532
<i>A boy? What boy?</i>

1814
01:19:31,729 --> 01:19:34,141
<i>The night before your audition?
Are you kidding?</i>

1815
01:19:34,331 --> 01:19:35,469
<i>I told her she could go.</i>

1816
01:19:35,666 --> 01:19:38,647
<i>It's ridiculous. It is out of the question.</i>

1817
01:19:38,836 --> 01:19:40,713
<i>Maybe it's ridiculous for me to spend</i>

1818
01:19:40,805 --> 01:19:42,648
<i>all my time practicing the violin...</i>

1819
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:46,310
<i>never doing anything else
and auditioning for a school tomorrow...</i>

1820
01:19:46,510 --> 01:19:48,490
<i>where I'm never going to do anything else</i>

1821
01:19:48,579 --> 01:19:50,490
<i>the whole rest of my life.</i>

1822
01:19:52,750 --> 01:19:53,785
<i>Huh?</i>

1823
01:19:55,152 --> 01:19:56,927
<i>Well, she's using her words.</i>

1824
01:19:57,121 --> 01:20:00,330
<i>Harper. Harper!
I cannot allow you to take a talent...</i>

1825
01:20:00,524 --> 01:20:03,733
<i>a gift to which you have
dedicated so much time and effort...</i>

1826
01:20:03,928 --> 01:20:06,238
<i>and throw it away on a whim.</i>

1827
01:20:06,430 --> 01:20:09,434
<i>I hate you and I wish
anyone else was my mother!</i>

1828
01:20:11,001 --> 01:20:12,947
<i>Maybe not those words.</i>

1829
01:20:13,337 --> 01:20:14,509
<i>Thanks, Mom and Dad.</i>

1830
01:20:14,705 --> 01:20:16,514
<i>I couldn't have
gotten through the week without you.</i>

1831
01:20:23,113 --> 01:20:24,683
<i>I say we head for the airport right now.</i>

1832
01:20:24,882 --> 01:20:27,488
<i>Don't even take our clothes
we just skedaddle.</i>

1833
01:20:31,355 --> 01:20:34,359
<i>I followed you for 35 years, Artie.</i>

1834
01:20:37,328 --> 01:20:41,708
<i>Wherever you needed to be,
that's where I was.</i>

1835
01:20:42,566 --> 01:20:44,603
<i>No complaints.</i>

1836
01:20:46,370 --> 01:20:48,646
<i>Well, some.</i>

1837
01:20:51,008 --> 01:20:52,851
<i>But this week...</i>

1838
01:20:53,978 --> 01:20:57,152
<i>This week was supposed to be about
us and our grandchildren.</i>

1839
01:20:58,182 --> 01:21:00,128
<i>Not you.</i>

1840
01:21:01,819 --> 01:21:03,355
<i>Not you.</i>

1841
01:21:06,957 --> 01:21:10,166
<i>Did you have to go to that audition?</i>

1842
01:21:11,929 --> 01:21:14,671
<i>It's not one of my better moments.</i>

1843
01:21:18,102 --> 01:21:20,605
<i>For one wonderful hour...</i>

1844
01:21:22,039 --> 01:21:26,852
<i>we weren't the "other" grandparents.</i>

1845
01:21:29,780 --> 01:21:30,850
<i>Oh.</i>

1846
01:21:30,948 --> 01:21:32,427
<i>There you are.</i>

1847
01:21:33,584 --> 01:21:35,222
<i>You okay?</i>

1848
01:21:36,820 --> 01:21:39,426
<i>I've had better Mommy days.</i>

1849
01:21:40,257 --> 01:21:44,103
<i>You know, it may not have been
horrible to let her go to that party.</i>

1850
01:21:44,295 --> 01:21:45,706
<i>I know.</i>

1851
01:21:45,896 --> 01:21:48,934
<i>I just walked into that scene and I freaked.</i>

1852
01:21:51,335 --> 01:21:53,144
<i>I can't believe my parents killed Carl.</i>

1853
01:21:53,671 --> 01:21:56,117
<i>Well, I was thinking about that.</i>

1854
01:21:56,307 --> 01:22:00,551
<i>You know, they didn't kill
Carl, only Barker could do that.</i>

1855
01:22:02,012 --> 01:22:06,757
<i>And it somehow took us
not being here for him to do it.</i>

1856
01:22:08,352 --> 01:22:10,593
<i>So, what's your point?</i>

1857
01:22:11,822 --> 01:22:14,132
<i>Maybe we coddle him too much.</i>

1858
01:22:15,092 --> 01:22:17,800
<i>Maybe he needed a little tough love...</i>

1859
01:22:17,995 --> 01:22:20,066
<i>to let go of his imaginary friend.</i>

1860
01:22:20,264 --> 01:22:24,906
<i>But, Phil, that would make my father right.</i>

1861
01:22:25,369 --> 01:22:27,940
<i>Yeah. We can't have any of that.</i>

1862
01:22:30,941 --> 01:22:31,783
<i>Harper?</i>

1863
01:22:35,546 --> 01:22:36,752
<i>I could come back.</i>

1864
01:22:36,947 --> 01:22:39,086
<i>No, no, no, it's okay.</i>

1865
01:22:39,283 --> 01:22:41,263
<i>I'm going to check on Barker.</i>

1866
01:22:43,787 --> 01:22:45,460
<i>Thanks, Phil.</i>

1867
01:22:53,630 --> 01:22:54,608
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1868
01:22:58,202 --> 01:22:59,340
<i>For what?</i>

1869
01:22:59,536 --> 01:23:01,106
<i>Narrow it down for me, Dad.</i>

1870
01:23:01,305 --> 01:23:02,682
<i>For this week.</i>

1871
01:23:04,308 --> 01:23:06,219
<i>For almost getting Barker hurt today.</i>

1872
01:23:06,310 --> 01:23:08,153
<i>I just feel terrible about that.</i>

1873
01:23:10,214 --> 01:23:12,023
<i>What were you even doing there?</i>

1874
01:23:18,022 --> 01:23:20,730
<i>I was on an audition.</i>

1875
01:23:21,592 --> 01:23:23,594
<i>Because the Grizzlies fired me.</i>

1876
01:23:24,795 --> 01:23:26,331
<i>What?</i>

1877
01:23:27,798 --> 01:23:29,004
<i>Why didn't you tell us?</i>

1878
01:23:29,199 --> 01:23:30,337
<i>Because it's humiliating.</i>

1879
01:23:30,534 --> 01:23:32,036
<i>Why would they do that?</i>

1880
01:23:32,236 --> 01:23:34,079
<i>You're so good at that job.</i>

1881
01:23:34,938 --> 01:23:35,916
<i>Maybe not good enough.</i>

1882
01:23:38,475 --> 01:23:39,852
<i>Alice...</i>

1883
01:23:40,811 --> 01:23:41,789
<i>your mom was really hoping...</i>

1884
01:23:41,979 --> 01:23:45,392
<i>that this trip would help bring
her closer to her grandchildren.</i>

1885
01:23:46,216 --> 01:23:47,923
<i>And she and Harper have developed</i>

1886
01:23:48,018 --> 01:23:51,022
<i>a relationship that's kind of great...</i>

1887
01:23:51,288 --> 01:23:55,259
<i>and I don't want
to see that end just because I screwed up.</i>

1888
01:24:00,297 --> 01:24:01,833
<i>- What about you?
- Hmm?</i>

1889
01:24:02,266 --> 01:24:04,576
<i>Don't you want a relationship
with your grandchildren?</i>

1890
01:24:04,768 --> 01:24:06,475
<i>Of course I do.</i>

1891
01:24:06,670 --> 01:24:08,081
<i>I mean...</i>

1892
01:24:08,272 --> 01:24:12,152
<i>like an hour
before you came home, it was really good.</i>

1893
01:24:13,110 --> 01:24:15,215
<i>It's just that sometimes...</i>

1894
01:24:17,181 --> 01:24:18,888
<i>I don't feel...</i>

1895
01:24:19,283 --> 01:24:20,455
<i>What?</i>

1896
01:24:20,818 --> 01:24:24,493
<i>...welcome, here.</i>

1897
01:24:30,194 --> 01:24:32,299
<i>What happened to us, Dad?</i>

1898
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:38,637
<i>How old were you when Harper was born?</i>

1899
01:24:38,869 --> 01:24:40,143
<i>- Twenty-six.
- Mmm-hmm.</i>

1900
01:24:40,337 --> 01:24:41,577
<i>Did you know what you were doing?</i>

1901
01:24:41,972 --> 01:24:42,973
<i>No.</i>

1902
01:24:43,941 --> 01:24:46,854
<i>I was 23 when you came along.</i>

1903
01:24:47,044 --> 01:24:50,685
<i>And I was terrified, because you didn't
come with any instructions.</i>

1904
01:24:50,881 --> 01:24:52,690
<i>And I thought I was doing okay.</i>

1905
01:24:52,883 --> 01:24:57,195
<i>Because unlike my father,
I wasn't constantly telling you...</i>

1906
01:24:57,387 --> 01:25:00,368
<i>what an annoying little waste
of time you were...</i>

1907
01:25:00,557 --> 01:25:02,628
<i>and believe me, I'm cleaning that up.</i>

1908
01:25:02,826 --> 01:25:05,636
<i>And I thought that we were
actually having fun.</i>

1909
01:25:05,829 --> 01:25:09,299
<i>Me and the weather girl...</i>

1910
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:13,107
<i>and the cutest little girl you ever saw,
travelling around the country.</i>

1911
01:25:13,303 --> 01:25:16,182
<i>But then years go by,
and your daughter goes off to college...</i>

1912
01:25:16,373 --> 01:25:20,014
<i>and she doesn't come home
for Thanksgiving or Christmas.</i>

1913
01:25:21,078 --> 01:25:22,614
<i>Or summers.</i>

1914
01:25:22,813 --> 01:25:24,156
<i>Or ever.</i>

1915
01:25:24,848 --> 01:25:28,125
<i>And you get these clues, this inkling...</i>

1916
01:25:28,318 --> 01:25:31,424
<i>that perhaps all those years
she wasn't having such a good time...</i>

1917
01:25:31,622 --> 01:25:36,662
<i>and that maybe she thought
you didn't do such a good job.</i>

1918
01:25:36,860 --> 01:25:39,739
<i>And that really hurts. Doesn't it?</i>

1919
01:25:42,399 --> 01:25:44,072
<i>Yes.</i>

1920
01:25:44,434 --> 01:25:47,904
<i>So, little girl,
I have to give you three put-ups.</i>

1921
01:25:49,273 --> 01:25:50,251
<i>- No, Dad.
- Please.</i>

1922
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:51,350
<i>It's okay.</i>

1923
01:25:51,542 --> 01:25:55,012
<i>Harper, Turner, Barker.</i>

1924
01:25:55,212 --> 01:25:57,692
<i>They're great kids
and you're a really good mother.</i>

1925
01:25:58,615 --> 01:25:59,616
<i>Yeah.</i>

1926
01:25:59,816 --> 01:26:02,558
<i>I'm basking in the glow
of my children's affection.</i>

1927
01:26:02,753 --> 01:26:04,858
<i>Harper? She didn't mean anything.</i>

1928
01:26:05,055 --> 01:26:06,363
<i>I mean, she's 12.</i>

1929
01:26:06,557 --> 01:26:08,559
<i>Get ready, it's going to get a lot worse.</i>

1930
01:26:09,793 --> 01:26:13,605
<i>Only, don't let her turn her back on you.</i>

1931
01:26:13,797 --> 01:26:15,743
<i>Because that will break your heart.</i>

1932
01:26:18,769 --> 01:26:19,941
<i>Harper?</i>

1933
01:26:21,772 --> 01:26:22,750
<i>No. Um...</i>

1934
01:26:23,774 --> 01:26:28,052
<i>Barker has a special request
for tomorrow, before the audition.</i>

1935
01:26:28,645 --> 01:26:30,716
<i>And it involves all of us.</i>

1936
01:26:47,231 --> 01:26:50,940
<i>Carl, your two favourite things were milk
and tofu dogs.</i>

1937
01:26:51,134 --> 01:26:53,614
<i>Now, you can have both forever.</i>

1938
01:27:11,154 --> 01:27:13,725
<i>Grandma, thanks for decorating the box.</i>

1939
01:27:13,991 --> 01:27:16,995
<i>Oh, honey, it was my pleasure.</i>

1940
01:27:20,030 --> 01:27:21,839
<i>Um,Carl...</i>

1941
01:27:22,032 --> 01:27:24,512
<i>Can Artie say something nice for Carl?</i>

1942
01:27:24,701 --> 01:27:25,873
<i>Me?</i>

1943
01:27:35,512 --> 01:27:36,490
<i>How do you--.</i>

1944
01:27:38,015 --> 01:27:41,087
<i>I'm sorry, Carl.</i>

1945
01:27:41,285 --> 01:27:43,891
<i>He died so young.</i>

1946
01:27:44,621 --> 01:27:45,759
<i>Mmm.</i>

1947
01:27:45,956 --> 01:27:49,233
<i>How do you say goodbye
to somebody you could never say hello to?</i>

1948
01:27:49,426 --> 01:27:50,666
<i>It's hard.</i>

1949
01:27:51,962 --> 01:27:53,566
<i>I didn't get to see Carl very often,</i>

1950
01:27:53,664 --> 01:27:55,234
<i>but then again, nobody else did.</i>

1951
01:27:56,900 --> 01:27:59,380
<i>Except for Barker...</i>

1952
01:27:59,569 --> 01:28:02,345
<i>which is what made him so special.</i>

1953
01:28:03,307 --> 01:28:07,619
<i>Carl wasn't just Barker's friend,
he was a part of him.</i>

1954
01:28:07,811 --> 01:28:11,054
<i>And that made him a part of all of us.</i>

1955
01:28:13,550 --> 01:28:16,861
<i>Carl, you will forever be in our hearts.</i>

1956
01:28:17,554 --> 01:28:19,261
<i>Keep on hopping, buddy.</i>

1957
01:28:47,784 --> 01:28:48,592
<i>Okay.</i>

1958
01:28:48,785 --> 01:28:51,095
<i>Alice, you take Harper backstage.
We'll grab some seats.</i>

1959
01:28:51,288 --> 01:28:52,266
<i>Barker, Turner, you're with us.</i>

1960
01:28:52,489 --> 01:28:53,627
<i>- Good luck.
- Knock them dead.</i>

1961
01:28:53,824 --> 01:28:54,802
<i>Thanks.</i>

1962
01:28:54,991 --> 01:28:56,299
<i>Break a leg.</i>

1963
01:28:56,493 --> 01:28:57,904
<i>Bye, Dad.</i>

1964
01:29:20,283 --> 01:29:22,388
<i>Don't applaud. That's that woman!</i>

1965
01:29:23,153 --> 01:29:24,427
<i>Good evening.</i>

1966
01:29:24,654 --> 01:29:28,761
<i>Welcome family, friends
and distinguished judges...</i>

1967
01:29:28,959 --> 01:29:31,565
<i>to the Atlanta Performing Arts Centre.</i>

1968
01:29:31,762 --> 01:29:34,072
<i>I am Doctor Sch veer.</i>

1969
01:29:37,134 --> 01:29:40,980
<i>We have 74 amazingly talented musicians...</i>

1970
01:29:41,171 --> 01:29:45,642
<i>all vying for one position
at this prestigious conservatory.</i>

1971
01:29:45,842 --> 01:29:48,482
<i>So, without further ado I give you</i>

1972
01:29:48,578 --> 01:29:51,184
<i>Chet Halloran on the saxophone</i>

1973
01:29:51,381 --> 01:29:53,759
<i>Yeah! Go Chet!</i>

1974
01:30:22,145 --> 01:30:24,716
<i>Hang on a second, honey.</i>

1975
01:30:29,186 --> 01:30:32,133
<i>You know,
when you were just five years old...</i>

1976
01:30:32,322 --> 01:30:34,893
<i>we took you to that
little music school for the first time.</i>

1977
01:30:35,091 --> 01:30:38,868
<i>And all the other kids
they were just banging on things.</i>

1978
01:30:39,930 --> 01:30:42,536
<i>One kid tried to play another kid.</i>

1979
01:30:43,533 --> 01:30:47,345
<i>But from that very first day, you played.</i>

1980
01:30:47,704 --> 01:30:49,240
<i>And not just played...</i>

1981
01:30:49,439 --> 01:30:52,682
<i>you had this look
of such fulfilment on your face.</i>

1982
01:30:52,943 --> 01:30:55,082
<i>And I said to your dad, "Whatever it takes...</i>

1983
01:30:55,278 --> 01:30:57,121
<i>"whatever we have to do, I always</i>

1984
01:30:57,214 --> 01:30:59,694
<i>"want to see that look on her face."</i>

1985
01:31:01,184 --> 01:31:03,687
<i>Lately, I'm not seeing it.</i>

1986
01:31:04,588 --> 01:31:08,400
<i>So, honey, do you
really not want to switch schools again?</i>

1987
01:31:11,728 --> 01:31:12,866
<i>Okay.</i>

1988
01:31:13,630 --> 01:31:15,769
<i>What do you say we ditch this audition?</i>

1989
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:18,470
<i>Really?</i>

1990
01:31:18,668 --> 01:31:21,444
<i>Yeah. It's okay.</i>

1991
01:31:24,007 --> 01:31:26,112
<i>Mommy, I didn't mean what I said.</i>

1992
01:31:26,977 --> 01:31:28,479
<i>Oh, baby.</i>

1993
01:31:29,145 --> 01:31:32,615
<i>I wouldn't want anyone else to be my mom.</i>

1994
01:31:32,816 --> 01:31:34,625
<i>And I love you.</i>

1995
01:31:34,818 --> 01:31:38,231
<i>That's good
because you're my only daughter.</i>

1996
01:31:38,588 --> 01:31:42,627
<i>And you know,
I don't really understand the boys.</i>

1997
01:31:42,826 --> 01:31:45,932
<i>I know. How weird are they?</i>

1998
01:31:48,865 --> 01:31:49,969
<i>Yeah, yeah!</i>

1999
01:31:50,166 --> 01:31:51,167
<i>Hi, baby.</i>

2000
01:31:52,936 --> 01:31:58,010
<i>We regret to inform you
of a slight change in our program.</i>

2001
01:31:58,208 --> 01:32:00,188
<i>Harper Simmons has forfeited her slot...</i>

2002
01:32:02,512 --> 01:32:03,991
<i>and her future.</i>

2003
01:32:04,180 --> 01:32:06,456
<i>Since the next performer is warming up...</i>

2004
01:32:06,650 --> 01:32:08,630
<i>we're going to have to take
a 10 minute break.</i>

2005
01:32:12,022 --> 01:32:13,467
<i>Hey. what's going on?</i>

2006
01:32:13,557 --> 01:32:15,230
<i>She's not going to audition.</i>

2007
01:32:15,425 --> 01:32:16,836
<i>You're not disappointed in me, are you?</i>

2008
01:32:17,160 --> 01:32:19,640
<i>Oh, no, no, no. That's not even a possibility.</i>

2009
01:32:19,829 --> 01:32:21,740
<i>Is this is all my fault? It is, isn't it?</i>

2010
01:32:21,932 --> 01:32:23,969
<i>I came 3,000 miles
to ruin my granddaughter's life.</i>

2011
01:32:24,167 --> 01:32:25,009
<i>It's not your fault.</i>

2012
01:32:25,201 --> 01:32:26,908
<i>- Really?
- It was our choice.</i>

2013
01:32:27,103 --> 01:32:27,979
<i>I love you.</i>

2014
01:32:28,171 --> 01:32:29,946
<i>Here, take my picture, Phil.</i>

2015
01:32:30,874 --> 01:32:31,818
<i>- Get in there.</i>

2016
01:32:39,115 --> 01:32:39,991
<i>Uh, where's Turner?</i>

2017
01:32:40,183 --> 01:32:41,423
<i>You! Kid!</i>

2018
01:32:44,154 --> 01:32:45,360
<i>Turner!</i>

2019
01:32:53,063 --> 01:32:55,100
<i>Bobby Thomson, up there swinging.</i>

2020
01:32:55,665 --> 01:32:57,303
<i>He's had two out of three,
a single and a double...</i>

2021
01:32:57,500 --> 01:33:00,276
<i>and Billy Cox is playing him
right and the third base line.</i>

2022
01:33:00,470 --> 01:33:02,882
<i>One out, last of the ninth. Branca pitches.</i>

2023
01:33:03,073 --> 01:33:06,452
<i>Bobby Thomson takes a strike
called on the inside corner.</i>

2024
01:33:06,643 --> 01:33:08,554
<i>Bobby hitting at .292.</i>

2025
01:33:08,745 --> 01:33:09,621
<i>He '5 had a single and a double“</i>

2026
01:33:09,813 --> 01:33:13,886
<i>and he drove in
the Giants first run with a long ?y to centre.</i>

2027
01:33:14,084 --> 01:33:15,688
<i>Lock man without
too big of a lead at second...</i>

2028
01:33:15,885 --> 01:33:18,695
<i>but he 'll be
running like the wind if Thomson hits one.</i>

2029
01:33:18,888 --> 01:33:19,958
<i>Branca throws.</i>

2030
01:33:20,156 --> 01:33:22,193
<i>There's a long drive!
It's going to be, I believe--</i>

2031
01:33:22,392 --> 01:33:26,204
<i>The Giants win the pennant!
The Giants win the pennant!</i>

2032
01:33:26,396 --> 01:33:28,239
<i>The Giants win the pennant!</i>

2033
01:33:28,431 --> 01:33:30,206
<i>The Giants win the pennant...</i>

2034
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:32,141
<i>and they're going crazy.</i>

2035
01:33:32,335 --> 01:33:34,008
<i>They're going crazy!</i>

2036
01:33:34,204 --> 01:33:36,980
<i>And home!</i>

2037
01:33:37,173 --> 01:33:38,117
<i>I don't believe it! I don't believe it!</i>

2038
01:33:39,442 --> 01:33:40,750
<i>- I do not believe it!</i>

2039
01:33:40,944 --> 01:33:43,254
<i>Bobby Thomson hit a line drive...</i>

2040
01:33:43,446 --> 01:33:46,222
<i>into the lower deck of the left field stands“</i>

2041
01:33:46,416 --> 01:33:48,987
<i>and the place is going crazy!</i>

2042
01:33:49,185 --> 01:33:52,928
<i>The Giants won it by a score of 5 to 4...</i>

2043
01:33:53,123 --> 01:33:55,433
<i>and they're picking Bobby Thomson up</i>

2044
01:33:55,525 --> 01:33:57,766
<i>and carrying him off the field!</i>

2045
01:34:01,464 --> 01:34:03,444
<i>Yeah! Yeah!</i>

2046
01:34:10,140 --> 01:34:11,414
<i>Wow.</i>

2047
01:34:12,742 --> 01:34:15,951
<i>I saw it. I saw it, Artie.</i>

2048
01:34:16,546 --> 01:34:18,423
<i>Call me Grandpa.</i>

2049
01:34:23,219 --> 01:34:26,359
<i>My big boy. How on earth...?</i>

2050
01:34:26,556 --> 01:34:28,035
<i>Grandpa taught me.</i>

2051
01:34:28,758 --> 01:34:29,828
<i>Oh...</i>

2052
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:39,607
<i>Your father was wrong.</i>

2053
01:34:41,438 --> 01:34:42,940
<i>So was yours.</i>

2054
01:34:47,444 --> 01:34:48,286
<i>Oh, Al.</i>

2055
01:34:52,782 --> 01:34:55,956
<i>How much would it
embarrass you if l kissed you right now?</i>

2056
01:34:56,286 --> 01:34:57,424
<i>I think a lot.</i>

2057
01:34:57,620 --> 01:34:58,792
<i>As soon as we get home.</i>

2058
01:34:58,988 --> 01:35:00,331
<i>Okay, I look forward to it.</i>

2059
01:35:00,523 --> 01:35:02,833
<i>Dr. Schveer, I shun you.</i>

2060
01:35:03,026 --> 01:35:04,903
<i>You are shunned.</i>

2061
01:35:07,630 --> 01:35:10,008
<i>My friends, it's taken me over 35 years
to say these words...</i>

2062
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:11,702
<i>it's opening day for the Giants</i>

2063
01:35:11,801 --> 01:35:13,280
<i>and we've got a capacity crowd.</i>

2064
01:35:13,470 --> 01:35:15,643
<i>Giants are out in the field.
There's Charlie "The Naz" Naznic...</i>

2065
01:35:15,839 --> 01:35:18,115
<i>batting .290, takes his stance at the plate.</i>

2066
01:35:18,308 --> 01:35:21,289
<i>Yes, Art. Let's see
if Naz can get his team out of a jam.</i>

2067
01:35:21,478 --> 01:35:23,082
<i>Okay, Turner, here's the action.</i>

2068
01:35:23,313 --> 01:35:24,189
<i>Naz swings!</i>

2069
01:35:24,380 --> 01:35:25,415
<i>He gets some wood on that one!</i>

2070
01:35:25,615 --> 01:35:26,821
<i>Hard drive to Barker Simmons.</i>

2071
01:35:26,950 --> 01:35:27,985
<i>Ooh! It's through his legs.</i>

2072
01:35:28,184 --> 01:35:29,754
<i>Walters has it. No, Walters loses it.</i>

2073
01:35:30,854 --> 01:35:33,494
<i>Sherman's got a glove down.
No, he stopped to pick his nose.</i>

2074
01:35:33,690 --> 01:35:35,966
<i>Now, Douglas is sitting down
and taking off his shoes...</i>

2075
01:35:36,159 --> 01:35:37,866
<i>because his mom said to me
before the game...</i>

2076
01:35:38,061 --> 01:35:39,802
<i>"Sometimes he's in another world."</i>

2077
01:35:39,996 --> 01:35:41,634
<i>Sherman still working
on that thing in his nose.</i>

2078
01:35:41,831 --> 01:35:43,606
<i>Man, that must be really packed in there!</i>

2079
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:44,710
<i>You betcha!</i>

2080
01:35:44,901 --> 01:35:45,971
<i>Naz rounds second, heads for third.</i>

2081
01:35:46,169 --> 01:35:48,308
<i>Sherman has the booger!
Sherman has the booger!</i>

2082
01:35:48,505 --> 01:35:51,543
<i>I don't believe it! I do not believe it!</i>

2083
01:35:51,741 --> 01:35:53,345
<i>The other players are coming over
to examine it.</i>

2084
01:35:53,543 --> 01:35:55,181
<i>I can see it from here!</i>

2085
01:35:55,378 --> 01:35:57,984
<i>Wow, you could take
an aerial photograph of that thing!</i>

2086
01:35:58,181 --> 01:36:01,185
<i>I'm sure there's going
to be orange slices in the locker room...</i>

2087
01:36:01,384 --> 01:36:02,192
<i>and a couple of tissues.</i>

2088
01:36:02,385 --> 01:36:05,457
<i>Meanwhile, Naz scores.
And that is another home run!</i>

2089
01:36:06,422 --> 01:36:10,734
<i>The Giants are still leading, 34 to 27.</i>

2090
01:36:10,927 --> 01:36:12,133
<i>What a first inning!</i>

2091
01:36:12,328 --> 01:36:13,170
<i>You're telling me.</i>

2092
01:36:13,363 --> 01:36:15,070
<i>I hope the second inning is shorter</i>

2093
01:36:15,165 --> 01:36:16,838
<i>because grandpa needs a bathroom break.</i>

2094
01:36:17,167 --> 01:36:19,147
<i>- Whoo!
- Go Barker!</i>

2095
01:36:19,335 --> 01:36:20,643
<i>Our next batter is coming
up to the plate.</i>

2096
01:36:20,837 --> 01:36:23,044
<i>He's number three, Barker Simmons.</i>

2097
01:36:23,239 --> 01:36:25,344
<i>Yeah, Barker!</i>

2098
01:36:25,575 --> 01:36:29,148
<i>Young man with incredible
power. Three-foot-four and 45 pounds.</i>

2099
01:36:30,213 --> 01:36:32,716
<i>He hits it to shortstop. Oh, it's through!</i>

2100
01:36:32,916 --> 01:36:34,156
<i>Barker heading towards first base.</i>

2101
01:36:34,350 --> 01:36:35,488
<i>No, he makes a right turn!</i>

2102
01:36:35,685 --> 01:36:37,358
<i>He makes a right turn.</i>

2103
01:36:37,554 --> 01:36:38,589
<i>Barker, go back!</i>

2104
01:36:38,688 --> 01:36:40,167
<i>He's going the wrong way.</i>

2105
01:36:40,890 --> 01:36:42,198
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

2106
01:36:42,392 --> 01:36:44,099
<i>I just wanted to say hi.</i>

2107
01:36:44,294 --> 01:36:46,365
<i>He just wanted to say hi.</i>

2108
01:36:46,563 --> 01:36:48,008
<i>Well, I don't think I've ever heard--</i>

2109
01:36:48,198 --> 01:36:49,734
<i>Turn around, everybody. Take our picture.</i>

2110
01:36:49,933 --> 01:36:51,571
<i>Okay, picture.</i>

2111
01:37:04,647 --> 01:37:06,786
<i>{got to
tell your friends, this is one of those days</i>

2112
01:37:06,983 --> 01:37:09,964
<i>Seventy-eight degrees,
the sold out crowd of 56' fans...</i>

2113
01:37:10,153 --> 01:37:12,064
<i>the smell of the popcorn, the hot dogs“</i>

2114
01:37:12,255 --> 01:37:14,735
<i>the loud pushy parents, and the crying kids.</i>

2115
01:37:14,924 --> 01:37:17,803
<i>But I'll tell you something,
there's no other place I'd rather be.</i>

2116
01:37:17,994 --> 01:37:20,406
<i>Andes my grandson Barker
