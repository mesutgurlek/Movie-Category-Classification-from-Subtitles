1
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:48,173
Your Highness, please allow me
this small contribution.

2
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,759
No, I cannot accept them.

3
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:53,554
Think what they could do
for your cause.

4
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:57,391
Those pearls would mean freedom
for my people...

5
00:00:57,599 --> 00:01:00,185
-...but I will not take them.
-Please!

6
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:03,730
These could save the lives
of many men.

7
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:05,649
My countrymen are proud.

8
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:08,902
They'd die rather than let
me accept charity.

9
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:12,489
Then think of the lives of the women,
the mothers--

10
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:15,450
The women fight alongside the men.

11
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:18,787
They are also too proud
to accept charity.

12
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:24,751
Then consider the lives of the
children. The innocent children.

13
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,590
But, for the children....

14
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:49,730
She's the blond
in the blue sequined dress.

15
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,398
Extremely rich...

16
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:54,943
...very married,
eminently corruptible...

17
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:57,571
...and a willing infidel.

18
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,163
Perfect.

19
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:03,178
Monsieur Andre, go see
what you can get for this.

20
00:05:03,554 --> 00:05:06,265
Not the royal ring, Your Highness!

21
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:09,184
Do you want the world to know?

22
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:32,416
Excuse me. Is that man
actually royalty?

23
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:36,461
-No, madame.
-You called him Your Highness.

24
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,797
It was a faux pas. Forget it.

25
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:41,675
You can trust me, I won't tell.

26
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:46,054
I am the police chief
of Beaumont sur Mer.

27
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:49,308
Why do Americans think
they can buy anyone?

28
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,310
I'm so sorry.

29
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:54,980
-I've caused the prince enough--
-Prince?

30
00:05:57,441 --> 00:06:01,278
He sounds like he's in trouble.
Perhaps I can help.

31
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:05,532
If you want to help,
forget everything you saw and heard.

32
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:11,246
Forget the very existence of
that brilliant, extraordinary man...

33
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,832
...of destiny.

34
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:23,759
Your Highness?

35
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:29,014
Don't be alarmed.
I can be trusted.

36
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:32,518
-Are you one of my subjects?
-No, I'm an American.

37
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,103
Fanny Eubanks of Omaha.

38
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:39,775
If you're in trouble,
and if I can help--

39
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:42,945
Thank you. But I cannot accept.

40
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:46,198
You've risked too much
just in speaking to me.

41
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,283
I still want to help.

42
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,622
You must understand.

43
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,125
I have powerful enemies.
They may be watching--

44
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,505
My God, you're attractive.

45
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:04,091
It's late.

46
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:09,012
I must go.

47
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,980
-Has he left?
-Yes, just a moment ago.

48
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:19,231
Good.

49
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,275
Please?

50
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:23,861
Tell me where he lives.

51
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:31,577
-I must warn you.
-He told me he has powerful enemies.

52
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:34,955
There may also be
an emotional risk.

53
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:39,001
His Highness has been a widower
for five years.

54
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:41,670
For five years?

55
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:49,553
Please, Your Highness.

56
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:52,055
Fanny...

57
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:54,683
...the freedom fighters thank you.

58
00:07:57,186 --> 00:07:59,146
This is for the overhead.

59
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,107
This goes to you, Arthur.

60
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:04,735
This goes to you, Andre.

61
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:06,737
This goes to me.

62
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:09,114
It's time to go to Zurich.

63
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:12,636
Excuse me.

64
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,222
-May I sit here, please?
-If you like.

65
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,932
Thank you.

66
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,184
Good evening, sir.

67
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:21,603
Would you like to see the menu?

68
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:25,148
I'm starving. Really starving.

69
00:09:29,111 --> 00:09:30,946
Prices!

70
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:36,451
I'll just have some water.

71
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:39,538
-Water?
-Yes.

72
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,754
Water? But you seemed so hungry.

73
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:52,426
I'm saving my money
for something special.

74
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:54,887
-My mother.
-Your mother?

75
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:59,766
Not really my mother. My grandmother.

76
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:02,102
But she raised me.

77
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:06,607
My real parents didn't want me.

78
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:09,276
I'm sorry.

79
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:12,404
But my grandmother is
a wonderful woman.

80
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:16,200
She has a laugh
that can make birds sing.

81
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:20,329
She's been quite ill lately.

82
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:23,540
The hospital bills
have been adding up.

83
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,627
I just want to do my share.

84
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:30,964
It's tough for me because
I was never good with money.

85
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:36,094
I take what the Red Cross pays me,
and give it back to them.

86
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:41,308
But I am going to help my Gram-Gram.

87
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:45,062
She is the one who taught me...

88
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:48,524
...it is better to be truthful
and good...

89
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:51,818
...than to not.

90
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:02,287
Waiter!

91
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:05,624
-What are you doing?
-Waiter.

92
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:12,047
-Give this man whatever he wants.
-I can't let you--

93
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:13,549
Nonsense!

94
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:19,596
I'll have a double
turkey sandwich on rye...

95
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:22,224
...a large knockwurst,
potato chips...

96
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:26,144
...chocolate milk and two beers.
You want one? Three beers.

97
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:27,521
Thank you.

98
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:52,254
Forgot I had a first-class ticket.

99
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:59,761
-That bother you?
-No.

100
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:09,313
I overheard your conversation
in the dining car.

101
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:12,482
My condolences to your grandmother.

102
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:21,241
-Right.
-Didn't you say she was ill?

103
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:25,162
I say what they want to hear
to get what I want.

104
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:29,208
Rather a shabby trick, isn't it?

105
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,462
You have a lot to learn
about women.

106
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:38,717
I'm afraid I am a bit naive
when it comes to the weaker sex.

107
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,225
Freddy Benson.

108
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,269
And you are?

109
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:52,481
Lawrence Jamieson.

110
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:56,276
You're married, aren't you?

111
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:58,195
You can tell?

112
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:00,656
Listen.

113
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:04,409
We're the weaker sex.
Men don't live as long as women.

114
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:08,539
We get more heart attacks,
strokes and prostate trouble.

115
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:11,375
I say, it's time for a change.

116
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,961
I say, let them give us money.

117
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:16,296
Let's live off them for a while.

118
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:18,841
That probably shocks you, right?

119
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:21,802
It's rather a revolutionary thought.

120
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,971
Do you think it's possible?

121
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:27,683
Look what I did in the dining car!

122
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:31,687
She gave me 100 francs.
That's twenty bucks!

123
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:36,149
Do you know what it's like
to take a woman for $20?

124
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:39,361
No, I don't.
I'm afraid it's out of my class.

125
00:13:41,697 --> 00:13:42,656
What?

126
00:13:42,865 --> 00:13:46,702
Too bad. We could've
had a blast on the Riviera.

127
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:53,625
You're headed for the Riviera?

128
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:57,504
There's a little town there
crawling with rich women.

129
00:13:58,297 --> 00:14:00,716
And what town is that?

130
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:04,344
Beaumont sur Mer.

131
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:08,599
Beaumont sur Mer?

132
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:11,226
You've been misinformed.

133
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:15,564
Beaumont used to be lively. It's been
taken over by retired couples.

134
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:18,358
-Quite dead.
-Are you sure?

135
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:19,985
Yes, I live there.

136
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:22,738
I'm considered the town's playboy.

137
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:28,911
The social activity
is on the Italian Riviera.

138
00:14:29,161 --> 00:14:30,621
Portofino.

139
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:37,878
It doesn't hurt to check it out.
Some sleepy towns really pay off.

140
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,590
Would you excuse me?

141
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:44,051
I have to phone
my wife and children.

142
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:46,678
To let them know
when I'm arriving.

143
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:48,889
They really got you on a leash.

144
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:50,474
Afraid so.

145
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:19,211
Well, here we are.

146
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:30,097
Older, retired couples?

147
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:33,267
-You have a ride into town?
-Yes.

148
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:34,935
You can give me a lift.

149
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:37,771
-You have a room?
-I never make reservations.

150
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,482
Is this train going to Portofino?

151
00:15:40,691 --> 00:15:43,026
Yes, it is. But we're getting off.

152
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:51,159
We're getting off, right?

153
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:58,792
-How far is Portofino?
-Portofino?

154
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:01,795
It's about 170 kilometers.
I live there.

155
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:03,881
-No.
-Yes.

156
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:07,759
Stay with me.
You can go to Portofino later.

157
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:10,971
I'd love to,
but my grandmother is there.

158
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,390
Your grandmother is in Portofino?

159
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:15,809
Yes. Actually, she's quite ill.

160
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:19,104
Good luck.
My best to your grandmother.

161
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:21,648
I hope her health improves. Ciao.

162
00:16:35,746 --> 00:16:38,165
Your call didn't give me much time.

163
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:43,003
Marion was perfect.
Make sure she gets back all right.

164
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,509
-May I ask why she was necessary?
-I needed a decoy.

165
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:53,013
This idiot sharing my compartment
fancied himself a player.

166
00:16:53,222 --> 00:16:56,099
Said he was going to hunt
in Beaumont sur Mer.

167
00:16:56,308 --> 00:16:59,770
Monsieur Lawrence,
you can dismiss such amateurs.

168
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:03,649
-Surely he was no match for you.
-You can't be too careful.

169
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:07,653
A poacher who shoots at rabbits
may scare big game away.

170
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:29,383
Hey, Lawrence, listen to this.

171
00:17:29,925 --> 00:17:34,221
''A clever young American con artist,
nicknamed The Jackal...

172
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:37,516
...has been working Western Europe.''

173
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:41,144
If he's in the papers,
how clever can he be?

174
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:42,479
To business.

175
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:45,774
Krista Knudson.

176
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:51,572
Widow of Lars Knudson,
the Danish match king.

177
00:17:54,783 --> 00:18:00,080
She left the Excelsior Hotel in Genoa
at 0740 hours this morning...

178
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:02,165
...in a white Ferrari.

179
00:18:02,374 --> 00:18:05,085
She should be arriving
at approximately....

180
00:18:07,462 --> 00:18:09,548
Here she is now.

181
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:15,846
-I'd like to help your grandmother.
-Oh, no.

182
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:19,474
-I've got some money.
-I wouldn't accept it.

183
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:23,187
That's strange.
There's a young man with her.

184
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:27,608
-Please, I insist. I insist.
-I'll pay you back.

185
00:18:28,317 --> 00:18:30,819
-The poacher?
-Yes.

186
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:34,531
And he's no longer satisfied
with rabbits.

187
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,950
Monsieur Police Inspector...

188
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:39,411
...can you arrange something for me?

189
00:18:39,703 --> 00:18:42,539
I'm gonna pay you back. I promise.

190
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:46,126
The usual?

191
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:52,341
Bonjour.

192
00:19:31,547 --> 00:19:33,048
Monsieur?

193
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,593
Merci.

194
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:43,267
Big pose!
We can do something like this, okay?

195
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:45,894
All right, here we go.

196
00:19:47,563 --> 00:19:50,691
Two more. Two more.
How much is that?

197
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:57,656
Have you seen enough, Mrs. Knudsen?

198
00:19:57,865 --> 00:20:01,368
That money was for
his grandmother's operation!

199
00:20:01,577 --> 00:20:03,579
Here we go!

200
00:20:05,414 --> 00:20:09,710
He is a confidence man.
Will madame sign the complaint?

201
00:20:10,586 --> 00:20:12,337
Gladly.

202
00:20:17,426 --> 00:20:20,929
I didn't steal any money.
She gave it to me!

203
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:22,848
She filed a complaint.

204
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:27,436
She caught me with another woman.
You're French, you understand.

205
00:20:27,603 --> 00:20:30,105
To be with another woman is French.

206
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:32,316
To be caught, that is American.

207
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:35,360
How am I gonna get out of here?

208
00:20:35,611 --> 00:20:38,989
That's very difficult.
The charge is serious.

209
00:20:39,198 --> 00:20:41,074
You are a vagrant, an unknown.

210
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:44,703
I'm not a vagrant! This is my point!

211
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:50,083
I know somebody here.
I met him on a train. His name is....

212
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:55,839
His name is....

213
00:20:56,048 --> 00:20:58,008
James.... No.

214
00:20:58,217 --> 00:20:59,384
His name is....

215
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:03,055
James Josephson. No, no!

216
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:05,432
James Lawrence.
Lawrence. Lawrence.

217
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:10,812
Lawrence F--

218
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:13,440
Lawrence Fells. Lawrence Fings.

219
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:16,401
Forrest Lawrenceton.

220
00:21:29,498 --> 00:21:31,625
His name is James Jestenthen.

221
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:34,169
Lawrence Jesterton.

222
00:21:36,964 --> 00:21:39,341
-Lawrence Jamieson?
-Yes.

223
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,927
Yes! Yes.

224
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:43,679
We're like this!

225
00:21:51,603 --> 00:21:54,815
Freddy, this is really very serious.

226
00:21:55,816 --> 00:21:58,986
-France doesn't treat gigolos lightly.
-What do you mean?

227
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:02,114
Until 75 years ago,
they castrated them.

228
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:04,741
Don't say that word.

229
00:22:05,534 --> 00:22:06,869
What do they do now?

230
00:22:07,077 --> 00:22:09,788
That depends on who the judge is.

231
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:13,750
Reynoux.

232
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:16,837
Judge Reynoux.

233
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:22,551
-Good luck.
-You can't go. You've got to help me.

234
00:22:23,844 --> 00:22:25,888
Do you have any money?

235
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:28,515
I got twelve-- Nine hundred dollars.

236
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:32,686
-I know this chap. He'll want $5000.
-I don't have $5000!

237
00:22:32,895 --> 00:22:35,522
-But can you get it?
-I have it at home.

238
00:22:35,731 --> 00:22:38,233
I could fly home
and mail him a check.

239
00:23:00,422 --> 00:23:02,049
He says you can go.

240
00:23:03,091 --> 00:23:06,428
He must have the money in 48 hours...

241
00:23:06,678 --> 00:23:09,348
...or he'll submit your name
to Interpol.

242
00:23:09,598 --> 00:23:14,895
-You can't ever travel in Europe again.
-That's fine. Thank you!

243
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:28,700
I'm good at sizing people up,
and I think you're one terrific guy.

244
00:23:29,535 --> 00:23:32,913
I suppose I get pleasure
from helping people out.

245
00:24:44,776 --> 00:24:47,571
I see you know His Highness.

246
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:49,615
Who?

247
00:24:49,865 --> 00:24:52,159
-The prince.
-The prince?

248
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:56,997
I saw him shake your hand
and pat you on the back.

249
00:24:57,623 --> 00:24:59,541
No kidding?

250
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:01,084
And you are?

251
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,003
Fanny Eubanks.

252
00:25:05,047 --> 00:25:08,383
Fanny Eubanks, of Omaha?

253
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:11,011
Of Omaha?

254
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,180
You don't have to cover up.

255
00:25:13,388 --> 00:25:17,309
It may be my money that's financing
your mission.

256
00:25:17,518 --> 00:25:20,062
You're financing my mission?

257
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:23,941
Perhaps His Highness mentioned me?

258
00:25:32,241 --> 00:25:35,285
Oh, Lady Fanny of Omaha.

259
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:37,913
He called me Lady Fanny?

260
00:25:38,956 --> 00:25:43,293
Yes. Lady Fanny of Omaha.
He speaks of you with affection.

261
00:25:43,502 --> 00:25:45,462
-A drink, sir?
-Thank you.

262
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:52,302
You have done a wonderful thing.

263
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,700
Sir?

264
00:26:15,284 --> 00:26:17,369
I'm very sorry, sir...

265
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:19,997
...but the man said it was urgent.

266
00:26:20,205 --> 00:26:23,250
-What man?
-The courier. He's waiting outside.

267
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:27,296
He said you would recognize
the secret password.

268
00:26:27,921 --> 00:26:32,009
-What secret password?
-Lady Fanny of Omaha.

269
00:26:41,476 --> 00:26:45,272
Take this to the guest bedroom
and see it's neatly pressed.

270
00:26:45,814 --> 00:26:47,274
Go ahead, Arthur.

271
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:50,360
Wow!

272
00:26:53,113 --> 00:26:55,240
All I can say is, ''Wow!''

273
00:26:55,741 --> 00:26:58,660
And I was
telling you how to take women!

274
00:26:59,453 --> 00:27:00,829
All right.

275
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:02,956
How much do you want?

276
00:27:03,332 --> 00:27:05,292
Your Highness, I don't want money...

277
00:27:05,542 --> 00:27:10,005
...from a man who needs every penny
to free his enslaved people.

278
00:27:13,592 --> 00:27:15,010
What do you want?

279
00:27:15,636 --> 00:27:17,638
This! This!

280
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:20,516
I want this!

281
00:27:22,768 --> 00:27:25,145
This is what I want.

282
00:27:25,354 --> 00:27:28,607
I don't want money.
I want you to teach me.

283
00:27:28,815 --> 00:27:30,651
You can't be serious.

284
00:27:31,026 --> 00:27:32,778
-Larry--
-Lawrence.

285
00:27:33,362 --> 00:27:35,531
I always wanted to be the best...

286
00:27:35,781 --> 00:27:38,367
...and I thought I was,
until I met you.

287
00:27:38,575 --> 00:27:43,163
I never knew how far you could go
with this scamming thing!

288
00:27:43,372 --> 00:27:48,043
This ''scamming thing,'' as you put it,
took me years to perfect.

289
00:27:49,711 --> 00:27:51,129
I got time.

290
00:27:51,338 --> 00:27:52,965
Why should I help you?

291
00:27:53,757 --> 00:27:57,344
A guy with my mouth
could ruin business for you.

292
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:07,855
What sort of education
did you have?

293
00:28:09,189 --> 00:28:10,858
High school diploma.

294
00:28:11,066 --> 00:28:13,026
And you majored in...?

295
00:28:13,652 --> 00:28:15,237
Metal shop.

296
00:28:16,071 --> 00:28:17,447
Metal shop.

297
00:28:31,128 --> 00:28:33,213
All right, I'll do it.

298
00:28:35,048 --> 00:28:38,051
I'll teach you and pay you
a percentage.

299
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:41,388
-Great!
-With this one understanding.

300
00:28:41,597 --> 00:28:45,809
-I run this operation. You do as I say.
-Great!

301
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:49,438
Classes begin after lunch.

302
00:28:56,278 --> 00:28:58,530
I have a plan for this Jackal.

303
00:28:58,739 --> 00:29:01,825
A man owes me a favor.
Rene the Knife.

304
00:29:02,075 --> 00:29:06,580
He is a master with the stiletto
and a magician at hiding a body.

305
00:29:07,331 --> 00:29:09,583
As police inspector,
I give you my word...

306
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:12,961
...the case will be investigated
in a slipshod manner.

307
00:29:13,212 --> 00:29:16,423
-Stop worrying.
-It's a mistake to take him in.

308
00:29:16,632 --> 00:29:18,717
I am taking him in gracefully...

309
00:29:18,926 --> 00:29:21,303
...in order to get him out gracefully.

310
00:32:23,986 --> 00:32:25,112
Well done.

311
00:32:25,654 --> 00:32:29,074
-I look great. I know the moves!
-You're ready.

312
00:32:29,324 --> 00:32:32,744
Remember our agreement.
You do exactly as I say.

313
00:32:32,953 --> 00:32:35,330
Exactly as you say.

314
00:32:43,922 --> 00:32:45,966
I feel like a kept man.

315
00:32:47,801 --> 00:32:49,428
I'm sorry.

316
00:32:49,845 --> 00:32:52,764
I'm telling Andre
to tear up the check.

317
00:32:52,973 --> 00:32:57,394
You can't. I paid
the 100,000 francs in cash.

318
00:32:59,104 --> 00:33:00,564
Damn.

319
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:03,317
Please don't be mad.

320
00:33:03,525 --> 00:33:07,321
He wouldn't let you leave
unless I paid your loan.

321
00:33:07,863 --> 00:33:09,656
What else did he say?

322
00:33:10,365 --> 00:33:14,870
How you needed the money for
your country to fight communists.

323
00:33:15,078 --> 00:33:17,664
It's just such a noble cause.

324
00:33:17,873 --> 00:33:21,001
Please don't be angry with me.

325
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:22,836
Pretty please.

326
00:33:23,045 --> 00:33:27,424
Here comes a creep man.
There's that smile!

327
00:33:28,842 --> 00:33:32,846
Daddy says we'll have the biggest
wedding Tulsa's ever seen.

328
00:33:33,055 --> 00:33:35,349
When can we fly back?

329
00:33:36,016 --> 00:33:38,477
Perhaps we should go by ship.

330
00:33:40,062 --> 00:33:42,231
Ruprecht loves the water.

331
00:33:42,481 --> 00:33:43,941
Ruprecht?

332
00:33:44,107 --> 00:33:45,692
Yes, Ruprecht.

333
00:33:47,152 --> 00:33:49,196
Didn't I tell you about him?

334
00:33:49,571 --> 00:33:51,615
Ruprecht is my brother.

335
00:33:52,199 --> 00:33:55,619
-You have a brother?
-Yes, the young prince.

336
00:33:56,787 --> 00:34:00,415
You mean I'm going home
with two princes?

337
00:34:01,208 --> 00:34:04,211
Wherever I go, Ruprecht goes too.

338
00:34:05,712 --> 00:34:07,673
When do I meet him?

339
00:34:07,923 --> 00:34:10,050
He's in his room as we speak.

340
00:34:10,259 --> 00:34:13,178
-Would you like to meet him?
-I would love to.

341
00:34:24,815 --> 00:34:29,069
-What's he doing out here?
-His quarters are here.

342
00:34:40,789 --> 00:34:44,543
I should warn you that Ruprecht is,
well...

343
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,461
...special.

344
00:34:55,512 --> 00:34:58,015
Ruprecht, it is I, your brother.

345
00:34:59,016 --> 00:35:00,976
No sudden moves.

346
00:35:19,745 --> 00:35:22,789
You've been banging your pots again.

347
00:35:27,294 --> 00:35:28,504
I told you...

348
00:35:28,712 --> 00:35:32,508
...if you keep doing it,
you won't have any pots left.

349
00:35:38,222 --> 00:35:40,307
All right.

350
00:35:41,892 --> 00:35:43,227
Cuddly-cuddly.

351
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:49,358
Don't do that.

352
00:35:52,069 --> 00:35:53,695
Stop it, Ruprecht.

353
00:35:58,325 --> 00:36:00,369
He's very affectionate.

354
00:36:00,702 --> 00:36:01,703
Come along.

355
00:36:05,207 --> 00:36:09,002
Now, I want you to meet
this nice lady.

356
00:36:10,003 --> 00:36:11,129
Mother?

357
00:36:11,338 --> 00:36:13,841
-This isn't your mother.
-Not Mother?

358
00:36:14,716 --> 00:36:16,844
But I have wonderful news.

359
00:36:17,094 --> 00:36:20,347
Miss Trumble and I
are going to be married.

360
00:36:20,931 --> 00:36:23,225
We're going to live in Oklahoma.

361
00:36:27,729 --> 00:36:29,356
Really?

362
00:36:32,317 --> 00:36:33,527
Oh, dear.

363
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:53,630
We have a guest.
What do we do for guests?

364
00:36:54,298 --> 00:36:57,092
What did we do
when Uncle Ted was here?

365
00:37:04,933 --> 00:37:06,935
No, Ruprecht.

366
00:37:10,105 --> 00:37:11,315
No...

367
00:37:11,565 --> 00:37:13,025
...after that.

368
00:37:15,861 --> 00:37:17,279
We apologize.

369
00:37:43,889 --> 00:37:45,974
You want the genital cuff?

370
00:37:49,186 --> 00:37:52,606
Don't worry.
We won't go anywhere without you.

371
00:37:53,065 --> 00:37:55,609
Oklahoma!

372
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:03,075
He'll enjoy Oklahoma's
wide-open spaces.

373
00:38:03,283 --> 00:38:05,452
He loves to run and run and run.

374
00:38:21,343 --> 00:38:23,846
-Not Mother?
-No, Ruprecht...

375
00:38:24,012 --> 00:38:26,265
...she's not our mother.

376
00:38:26,974 --> 00:38:29,601
Go on, Diana. You were saying?

377
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:31,061
I think the--

378
00:38:32,187 --> 00:38:35,399
-May I take your trident, sir?
-Yes.

379
00:38:35,649 --> 00:38:39,987
You were saying the poor
shouldn't be allowed in museums.

380
00:38:40,195 --> 00:38:44,491
-I think that....
-Don't take the cork off the fork.

381
00:38:45,075 --> 00:38:48,871
-Why the cork?
-To prevent him hurting himself...

382
00:38:49,121 --> 00:38:51,164
...and others.

383
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:54,418
Eat your applesauce.

384
00:39:00,215 --> 00:39:02,176
We have wonderful news.

385
00:39:03,218 --> 00:39:04,887
Diana and I...

386
00:39:05,095 --> 00:39:06,847
...are going to be married.

387
00:39:07,181 --> 00:39:09,516
We're going to live in Palm Beach.

388
00:39:15,898 --> 00:39:17,107
Eat your food.

389
00:39:17,816 --> 00:39:21,028
Excuse me.
May I go to the bathroom first?

390
00:39:21,904 --> 00:39:22,988
Of course.

391
00:39:36,585 --> 00:39:37,669
Thank you.

392
00:39:44,176 --> 00:39:46,553
Driving relaxes Ruprecht.

393
00:39:53,602 --> 00:39:57,314
Lawrence, this is
the happiest day of my life!

394
00:39:57,523 --> 00:40:00,359
I think my testicles are dropping.

395
00:40:06,615 --> 00:40:09,034
It's been a very good month, chaps.

396
00:40:09,243 --> 00:40:11,787
We've got 20% for the overhead.

397
00:40:12,037 --> 00:40:15,123
-For you, Arthur, it's 10%.
-Thank you, sir.

398
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:18,252
15% for you, Andre.

399
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:21,421
-Nice work.
-And the rest is for me.

400
00:40:21,964 --> 00:40:24,550
-Au revoir, Lawrence.
-Au revoir, Andre.

401
00:40:30,347 --> 00:40:33,100
Excuse me. What about me?
What do I get?

402
00:40:34,393 --> 00:40:37,604
You are the student.
You get knowledge.

403
00:40:37,813 --> 00:40:40,941
I did most of the work.
I should get my share.

404
00:40:41,191 --> 00:40:44,278
I can't give it to you
without being sure...

405
00:40:44,486 --> 00:40:47,781
...that you spend it wisely,
on beauty and culture.

406
00:40:48,031 --> 00:40:51,118
I致e got culture coming out
of my ass.

407
00:40:51,368 --> 00:40:54,079
Spending money is a responsibility.

408
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:57,749
All right, how am I
supposed to spend my money?

409
00:40:59,251 --> 00:41:02,171
Now, all these wines are very old.

410
00:41:02,337 --> 00:41:06,175
I bought them to make sure
they were cared for properly.

411
00:41:06,341 --> 00:41:10,637
-You got a lot of wine to drink.
-They're too valuable to drink.

412
00:41:10,846 --> 00:41:15,058
-So you sell them?
-Never, they mean too much to me.

413
00:41:17,603 --> 00:41:22,357
In Europe, gardens take centuries
to grow and cultivate.

414
00:41:22,566 --> 00:41:24,067
This one was dying...

415
00:41:24,276 --> 00:41:27,654
...until Mrs. Everson's brooch
paid for its upkeep.

416
00:41:27,863 --> 00:41:29,114
What's the angle?

417
00:41:29,364 --> 00:41:31,658
There is no angle.

418
00:41:36,788 --> 00:41:39,208
I rescued this from destruction...

419
00:41:39,374 --> 00:41:41,710
...and donated it to the museum.

420
00:41:42,252 --> 00:41:45,172
Just looking at it feeds my soul.

421
00:41:46,131 --> 00:41:48,842
-May I say something here?
-Of course.

422
00:41:49,051 --> 00:41:51,553
Are you kidding me or what?

423
00:41:52,513 --> 00:41:54,014
I don't get it!

424
00:41:54,264 --> 00:41:57,017
You want me to spend money
on wine you can't drink...

425
00:41:57,226 --> 00:42:00,312
...on a garden that looks like
a mowing headache.

426
00:42:00,521 --> 00:42:04,525
That's a sculpture of a naked woman
and I appreciate that.

427
00:42:04,733 --> 00:42:07,402
But otherwise,
you have got to be joking.

428
00:42:07,611 --> 00:42:09,863
You agreed to do as I say.

429
00:42:10,072 --> 00:42:12,199
But not to spending my money...

430
00:42:12,407 --> 00:42:15,244
...or to playing Ruprecht
the Monkey Boy.

431
00:42:15,452 --> 00:42:17,871
I知 going it alone.

432
00:42:21,208 --> 00:42:23,126
You have so much to learn.

433
00:42:23,418 --> 00:42:26,713
No, thanks. I was doing great
with my own look.

434
00:42:26,964 --> 00:42:29,424
I don't need these clothes
or your instructions.

435
00:42:29,633 --> 00:42:33,262
You taught me what you know.
Great. Thanks a yahoo.

436
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:36,098
I知 getting out of this town.

437
00:42:37,224 --> 00:42:38,684
Good luck.

438
00:42:56,785 --> 00:43:00,956
He's tucked his tail between
his legs and crawled away.

439
00:43:01,164 --> 00:43:04,459
Good, then it is business as usual.

440
00:43:05,169 --> 00:43:08,255
-Au revoir, Lawrence.
-Au revoir, Andre.

441
00:43:08,463 --> 00:43:10,007
Oh, miss?

442
00:43:12,176 --> 00:43:15,262
Where can I find
the Wall Street Journal?

443
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:19,099
I want to see
how my takeover bid is going.

444
00:43:19,349 --> 00:43:22,227
It's so hard to get
the stock prices here.

445
00:43:26,899 --> 00:43:28,984
What are you doing here?

446
00:43:30,194 --> 00:43:32,154
That's a funny story.

447
00:43:32,738 --> 00:43:36,033
I知 at the train station,
ticket in hand.

448
00:43:36,241 --> 00:43:39,786
I said to myself, ''Why am I leaving?
I love me here.''

449
00:43:39,995 --> 00:43:42,706
I値l be around a little more.
Lucky you.

450
00:43:48,837 --> 00:43:53,175
There isn't enough room for both of us
in Beaumont sur Mer.

451
00:43:53,383 --> 00:43:56,011
You know, I think you're scared.

452
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:57,304
-Of what?
-Me.

453
00:43:57,513 --> 00:44:01,850
You've been top dog so long,
you think you own the place.

454
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:04,061
I知 not afraid of you.

455
00:44:04,311 --> 00:44:09,191
You should be. I知 younger than you,
better-looking than you...

456
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:11,652
...I知 thinner than you.

457
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:15,030
I can kick you out
in a New York minute.

458
00:44:15,239 --> 00:44:18,367
And I could have you arrested again.

459
00:44:23,205 --> 00:44:26,208
And I could call Lady Fanny of Omaha.

460
00:44:32,631 --> 00:44:35,133
Freddy, as a younger man...

461
00:44:36,009 --> 00:44:39,638
...I was a sculptor, a painter
and a musician.

462
00:44:40,597 --> 00:44:42,766
There was just one problem:

463
00:44:43,183 --> 00:44:45,143
I wasn't very good.

464
00:44:45,435 --> 00:44:48,146
As a matter of fact, I was dreadful.

465
00:44:49,064 --> 00:44:51,817
I came to the frustrating
conclusion...

466
00:44:52,067 --> 00:44:55,362
...that I had taste and style,
but not talent.

467
00:44:55,571 --> 00:44:57,614
I knew my limitations.

468
00:44:58,574 --> 00:45:01,285
We all have our limitations, Freddy.

469
00:45:01,493 --> 00:45:05,747
Fortunately, I discovered that
taste and style are commodities...

470
00:45:05,998 --> 00:45:07,666
...that people desire.

471
00:45:07,875 --> 00:45:10,335
Freddy, what I知 saying is...

472
00:45:10,752 --> 00:45:13,714
...know your limitations.
You are a moron.

473
00:45:14,506 --> 00:45:18,051
You've wanted me out of town
ever since I arrived.

474
00:45:19,178 --> 00:45:23,390
I tell you what. We'll make a bet.
If I lose, I値l leave.

475
00:45:23,932 --> 00:45:27,102
If I win, you leave.

476
00:45:27,686 --> 00:45:31,064
All right, Freddy,
suppose we try this.

477
00:45:31,773 --> 00:45:34,359
We find a woman, set a price...

478
00:45:34,568 --> 00:45:38,864
...and the first man to extract
the correct amount from her wins.

479
00:45:39,198 --> 00:45:40,949
But if you--

480
00:45:43,035 --> 00:45:44,453
But if you lose...

481
00:45:44,661 --> 00:45:47,122
...you not only leave town
graciously...

482
00:45:47,331 --> 00:45:50,167
...you promise never
to come back again.

483
00:45:50,876 --> 00:45:53,170
Done. Who's the woman?

484
00:46:11,772 --> 00:46:13,440
-Charles.
-Yes, monsieur.

485
00:46:13,649 --> 00:46:17,069
-Who is that?
-Miss Janet Colgate.

486
00:46:17,277 --> 00:46:18,570
Who is she?

487
00:46:18,779 --> 00:46:22,282
I believe she is
the United States Soap Queen.

488
00:46:22,491 --> 00:46:24,117
Thank you.

489
00:46:29,623 --> 00:46:31,458
Okay, how much?

490
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,002
She's a little young.

491
00:46:34,211 --> 00:46:36,213
Out of your league?

492
00:46:45,848 --> 00:46:50,227
-I値l make it easy for you. $50,000.
-$50,000?

493
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:53,939
Out of your league?

494
00:46:55,983 --> 00:46:59,486
All right. I could use $50,000.

495
00:46:59,736 --> 00:47:02,239
First one to get 50,000 out of her.

496
00:47:02,531 --> 00:47:04,741
May the best man win.

497
00:47:05,534 --> 00:47:06,827
Thank you.

498
00:47:45,365 --> 00:47:47,326
She is at the roulette table.

499
00:47:47,534 --> 00:47:50,370
Just waiting for Your Highness.

500
00:47:50,913 --> 00:47:52,456
And Freddy?

501
00:47:52,956 --> 00:47:55,083
He has dropped from sight.

502
00:47:55,584 --> 00:47:59,379
Perhaps the Jackal realizes
he is no match for the Lion.

503
00:47:59,588 --> 00:48:03,884
Keep your eyes open, Andre.
He'll turn up.

504
00:49:26,842 --> 00:49:29,595
Excuse me. Excuse me.

505
00:49:31,847 --> 00:49:33,849
Sorry, ma'am.
Excuse me.

506
00:49:34,641 --> 00:49:36,226
I知 sorry.

507
00:49:38,687 --> 00:49:40,189
I知 sorry.

508
00:49:43,692 --> 00:49:44,985
Pardon me.

509
00:49:47,988 --> 00:49:49,198
Hi.

510
00:49:53,452 --> 00:49:54,745
Thank you.

511
00:49:56,705 --> 00:49:58,040
Sorry.

512
00:49:58,665 --> 00:50:00,042
Excuse me.

513
00:50:00,709 --> 00:50:02,127
Thank you.

514
00:50:11,303 --> 00:50:14,932
Pardon me, miss.
Will you place a bet for me?

515
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:18,185
It's difficult for me
to reach the table.

516
00:50:18,393 --> 00:50:21,188
Sure. What number would you like?

517
00:50:22,564 --> 00:50:25,025
The way my luck's been running....

518
00:50:25,567 --> 00:50:27,986
Would you pick a number for me?

519
00:50:29,863 --> 00:50:32,699
I could use all the luck I can get.

520
00:50:57,766 --> 00:51:02,563
Will you ask him if he could advance
me a few dollars on this?

521
00:51:02,771 --> 00:51:05,315
I知 sorry, I cannot, monsieur.

522
00:51:05,566 --> 00:51:07,442
That's fine. Thank you.

523
00:51:25,127 --> 00:51:26,962
Excuse me.

524
00:51:27,171 --> 00:51:28,672
Monsieur wins again.

525
00:51:34,678 --> 00:51:37,681
Listen, maybe I can help you.

526
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:41,560
-That was my last chance.
-Last chance for what?

527
00:51:41,768 --> 00:51:44,104
My last chance for an operation.

528
00:51:44,813 --> 00:51:48,025
Shouldn't the Navy pay
for your operation?

529
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:51,778
It's not for me.

530
00:51:52,237 --> 00:51:54,239
It's for my grandmother.

531
00:51:54,573 --> 00:51:59,578
I just heard from the hospital
that she's in bad shape...

532
00:51:59,995 --> 00:52:03,415
...and if they don't operate soon,
she might....

533
00:52:04,124 --> 00:52:09,296
I知 sorry. I don't know you and
I知 bothering you with my problems.

534
00:52:09,505 --> 00:52:12,132
Please don't feel that way.

535
00:52:12,549 --> 00:52:15,010
Just tell me what they are.

536
00:52:20,891 --> 00:52:23,852
Just one stroke of bad luck
after another.

537
00:52:24,019 --> 00:52:26,647
Andre, come with me.

538
00:52:39,201 --> 00:52:41,370
10,000 francs!

539
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:43,914
That's almost $2000.

540
00:52:45,707 --> 00:52:47,835
I don't know how to thank you.

541
00:52:50,504 --> 00:52:52,464
But I want you to know...

542
00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:56,677
...that you've saved the life
of a wonderful person.

543
00:52:57,052 --> 00:53:00,347
You are a wonderful person. Thank you.

544
00:53:01,473 --> 00:53:03,058
You're welcome.

545
00:53:08,814 --> 00:53:11,316
Would an operation help you?

546
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:15,028
No. My problem isn't physical.

547
00:53:15,237 --> 00:53:16,947
-It's emotional.
-Really?

548
00:53:18,615 --> 00:53:21,159
I知 on six weeks' MTL.

549
00:53:22,035 --> 00:53:24,121
Mental Trauma Leave.

550
00:53:24,913 --> 00:53:26,665
What happened?

551
00:53:28,041 --> 00:53:30,961
I was engaged to a girl
back in the States.

552
00:53:32,254 --> 00:53:34,047
We loved to dance.

553
00:53:35,174 --> 00:53:38,385
We wanted to be professionals.
Isn't that silly?

554
00:53:39,970 --> 00:53:41,513
We got an opportunity...

555
00:53:41,763 --> 00:53:44,558
...to perform on TV, on Dance USA.

556
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:49,396
We decided that if we won,
we'd get married.

557
00:53:49,813 --> 00:53:52,149
So, we went on...

558
00:53:52,357 --> 00:53:54,610
...and we danced, and we won.

559
00:53:54,818 --> 00:53:56,987
Great!

560
00:53:57,362 --> 00:53:58,906
In the excitement...

561
00:53:59,823 --> 00:54:01,742
...we got separated.

562
00:54:02,576 --> 00:54:04,745
So I went back to the studio.

563
00:54:06,872 --> 00:54:08,582
And there they were.

564
00:54:09,875 --> 00:54:11,460
Naked.

565
00:54:12,127 --> 00:54:13,921
Dancing.

566
00:54:15,797 --> 00:54:17,508
Then they stopped.

567
00:54:18,467 --> 00:54:21,970
And they made love
right on the dance floor.

568
00:54:23,805 --> 00:54:25,307
Who was she with?

569
00:54:30,187 --> 00:54:34,066
Danny Terrio,
the host of Dance USA.

570
00:54:36,235 --> 00:54:37,611
I知 sorry.

571
00:54:42,324 --> 00:54:44,785
In the morning, I woke up...

572
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:47,454
...and my legs were useless.

573
00:54:47,871 --> 00:54:48,956
Numb.

574
00:54:49,164 --> 00:54:51,166
Oh, my God.

575
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:55,128
-I couldn't walk.
-Oh, my God!

576
00:54:59,091 --> 00:55:01,301
Surely someone can help you.

577
00:55:01,510 --> 00:55:02,511
Yeah....

578
00:55:02,761 --> 00:55:04,930
-There is, but--
-What?

579
00:55:06,682 --> 00:55:10,352
There's this psychiatrist,
Dr. Emil Schuffhausen...

580
00:55:10,602 --> 00:55:12,354
...in Liechtenstein.

581
00:55:12,729 --> 00:55:14,147
Why don't you go to him?

582
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,986
Schuffhausen is in demand
all over the world.

583
00:55:19,194 --> 00:55:21,405
He gets astronomical fees.

584
00:55:21,655 --> 00:55:24,992
It's just not something I can handle.

585
00:55:26,285 --> 00:55:28,871
What do you mean, astronomical?

586
00:55:29,955 --> 00:55:31,707
$50,000.

587
00:55:33,542 --> 00:55:35,919
That is a lot of money.

588
00:55:45,554 --> 00:55:47,055
Are you okay?

589
00:55:47,514 --> 00:55:49,600
Oh, God.

590
00:55:49,850 --> 00:55:51,560
They're dancing.

591
00:55:52,186 --> 00:55:53,854
They're dancing!

592
00:55:56,231 --> 00:56:00,485
We're going up to my room
to write to Dr. Schuffhausen.

593
00:56:00,736 --> 00:56:02,946
Oh, God! They're dancing!

594
00:56:03,864 --> 00:56:06,200
Take me from this place!

595
00:56:26,678 --> 00:56:30,182
I wish you hadn't written
these things.

596
00:56:30,432 --> 00:56:34,061
-I sound like a hero.
-They're true, aren't they?

597
00:56:34,311 --> 00:56:35,395
Yes.

598
00:56:35,646 --> 00:56:39,441
Still, where am I gonna get $50,000?

599
00:56:39,691 --> 00:56:44,029
Leave that to me.
When the time comes, you'll have it.

600
00:56:44,238 --> 00:56:47,407
I知 going to mail this letter.
I値l be back.

601
00:56:47,658 --> 00:56:49,284
Janet....

602
00:56:50,994 --> 00:56:52,621
Thank you.

603
00:57:00,921 --> 00:57:03,966
Number one! Number one!
Number one!

604
00:57:11,348 --> 00:57:13,308
Dr. Schuffhausen!

605
00:57:13,851 --> 00:57:16,103
Dr. Emil Schuffhausen!

606
00:57:33,579 --> 00:57:35,122
Hello, again!

607
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:38,959
Are you Dr. Schuffhausen?

608
00:57:40,085 --> 00:57:41,795
Yes, Fraulein.

609
00:57:42,004 --> 00:57:45,507
What a coincidence!
This is a miracle.

610
00:57:45,757 --> 00:57:49,094
I just wrote you about
someone who needs help.

611
00:57:49,303 --> 00:57:54,391
Good. I look forward to reading it
when I get back to my clinic.

612
00:57:56,852 --> 00:57:58,312
What?

613
00:57:58,604 --> 00:58:00,105
Goodbye.

614
00:58:06,028 --> 00:58:08,572
Could I talk to you for a minute?

615
00:58:08,822 --> 00:58:11,283
Please. I am on my vacation.

616
00:58:11,533 --> 00:58:14,661
It's about an American officer,
Fred Benson.

617
00:58:14,912 --> 00:58:17,456
He was next to you
at the roulette table.

618
00:58:17,664 --> 00:58:20,542
-Benson....
-In the wheelchair?

619
00:58:21,335 --> 00:58:23,962
Is he the one who wrote me
those letters?

620
00:58:24,171 --> 00:58:28,383
Something about his fiancee
running off with a dancer?

621
00:58:28,634 --> 00:58:31,303
That's the one.
He's here in the hotel.

622
00:58:31,553 --> 00:58:34,890
I hate to disturb you
while you're on vacation...

623
00:58:35,098 --> 00:58:38,101
...but could you take a look at him?

624
00:58:38,352 --> 00:58:41,021
I知 sorry-- What is your name?

625
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:42,731
Janet Colgate.

626
00:58:43,899 --> 00:58:47,319
I知 sorry, but if I see
your friend Benson...

627
00:58:47,569 --> 00:58:49,571
...I have to see everyone.

628
00:58:49,821 --> 00:58:52,199
I must draw the line somewhere.

629
00:58:55,577 --> 00:58:59,623
-If it's money--
-You didn't give him money, did you?

630
00:58:59,873 --> 00:59:02,292
Just a little for his grandmother.

631
00:59:02,543 --> 00:59:04,211
Don't give him any more.

632
00:59:04,419 --> 00:59:05,629
Why?

633
00:59:05,879 --> 00:59:06,880
You see...

634
00:59:07,381 --> 00:59:11,468
...his ego has taken one shattering blow
from a woman.

635
00:59:12,094 --> 00:59:15,347
And if he accepts charity
from a woman...

636
00:59:15,556 --> 00:59:17,307
...that is another blow.

637
00:59:17,683 --> 00:59:19,476
It makes my work harder.

638
00:59:19,685 --> 00:59:23,146
-Then you'll see him?
-All right. I値l see him.

639
00:59:23,397 --> 00:59:26,859
-That's wonderful!
-Remember what I said.

640
00:59:27,401 --> 00:59:28,694
No money for him.

641
00:59:28,944 --> 00:59:31,405
If I decide to take this case...

642
00:59:31,613 --> 00:59:34,616
...you must pay the fee
directly to me.

643
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:37,369
-You understand?
-Absolutely.

644
00:59:37,619 --> 00:59:38,912
All right.

645
00:59:40,247 --> 00:59:42,457
Where is the boy?

646
01:00:02,227 --> 01:00:04,229
Where are you?

647
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:07,733
You can really get lost
in these big places!

648
01:00:09,651 --> 01:00:12,821
I have a wonderful surprise for you.

649
01:00:13,071 --> 01:00:15,032
-What?
-Cover your eyes.

650
01:00:17,117 --> 01:00:20,329
-You are a nut!
-Go on.

651
01:00:23,165 --> 01:00:26,084
Who's the one person in the world...

652
01:00:26,293 --> 01:00:28,420
...outside of your grandmother...

653
01:00:28,670 --> 01:00:31,924
...that you'd like most to see
right now?

654
01:00:32,591 --> 01:00:34,092
I give up. Who?

655
01:00:34,301 --> 01:00:36,762
Dr. Emil Schuffhausen!

656
01:00:43,685 --> 01:00:46,396
At last we meet, Officer Benson.

657
01:00:46,647 --> 01:00:49,650
After all those letters,
I feel I know you.

658
01:00:52,402 --> 01:00:56,657
-He can't believe it's you.
-Yes, I think that's it.

659
01:00:57,032 --> 01:00:59,451
I am here to help you, my boy.

660
01:01:01,453 --> 01:01:03,455
Great!

661
01:01:08,710 --> 01:01:11,380
Let's have a look at those legs.

662
01:01:13,382 --> 01:01:14,800
So...

663
01:01:15,217 --> 01:01:18,512
...you are numb from the waist down?

664
01:01:20,055 --> 01:01:22,599
-Is that correct?
-Yes, sir.

665
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:26,562
Completely numb? No feeling whatsoever?

666
01:01:27,062 --> 01:01:28,438
That's right.

667
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:35,779
You won't feel Mr. Piggy
then, will you?

668
01:01:36,363 --> 01:01:37,698
No.

669
01:01:42,077 --> 01:01:44,162
Tell me if you feel this.

670
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:46,915
Tickle, tickle, tickle.

671
01:01:50,711 --> 01:01:51,879
No.

672
01:01:59,303 --> 01:02:01,638
We must try something else.

673
01:02:03,265 --> 01:02:05,893
Something a little more stringent.

674
01:02:38,175 --> 01:02:39,343
Tell me...

675
01:02:39,885 --> 01:02:41,428
...do you feel this?

676
01:02:45,182 --> 01:02:46,517
No.

677
01:02:52,064 --> 01:02:53,232
How about...

678
01:02:54,608 --> 01:02:55,817
...that?

679
01:02:58,070 --> 01:03:00,447
-Nothing.
-Nothing, eh?

680
01:03:00,989 --> 01:03:04,409
Watch yourself, Janet.
Back a little bit.

681
01:03:04,785 --> 01:03:05,953
Thank you.

682
01:03:09,164 --> 01:03:10,123
How about...

683
01:03:10,749 --> 01:03:12,209
...this?

684
01:03:15,337 --> 01:03:16,463
Nothing?

685
01:03:38,318 --> 01:03:40,279
Any feeling there?

686
01:03:42,364 --> 01:03:43,866
No?

687
01:03:45,868 --> 01:03:47,911
This case intrigues me.

688
01:03:48,161 --> 01:03:52,124
-I will take him as a patient.
-Did you hear that, Freddy?

689
01:03:55,294 --> 01:03:57,171
I am renting a villa here.

690
01:03:57,379 --> 01:04:00,674
We'll move him in,
and I will go to work on him.

691
01:04:00,883 --> 01:04:04,636
Thank you. Do you think
you can get him to walk again?

692
01:04:04,845 --> 01:04:08,265
I will have him running,
jumping, screaming...

693
01:04:08,473 --> 01:04:12,060
...or my name isn't
Dr. Emil Schuffhausen...

694
01:04:12,311 --> 01:04:14,438
...the Third.

695
01:04:17,566 --> 01:04:20,027
Look, he's so happy he's crying.

696
01:05:07,324 --> 01:05:08,992
Your Highness!

697
01:05:15,123 --> 01:05:16,667
Mrs. Reed!

698
01:05:17,459 --> 01:05:22,256
I didn't recognize you for a moment.
How wonderful to see you!

699
01:05:22,464 --> 01:05:24,466
Protector of the Veldt.

700
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:27,761
What a pleasant surprise!

701
01:05:27,970 --> 01:05:31,890
-How was your mission to Belahavula?
-It was a great success.

702
01:05:32,099 --> 01:05:34,935
-Thanks to you.
-I feel so proud.

703
01:05:35,143 --> 01:05:37,729
Mrs. Reed, may I present Lady Janet.

704
01:05:37,938 --> 01:05:39,898
Lady Janet, this is Mrs. Reed.

705
01:05:40,148 --> 01:05:41,400
How do you do?

706
01:05:42,484 --> 01:05:44,778
Your Highness, your accent--

707
01:05:44,987 --> 01:05:48,282
-I知 traveling incognito.
-Oh. I see.

708
01:05:49,157 --> 01:05:51,660
How are the freedom fighters?

709
01:05:52,077 --> 01:05:54,162
Lady Janet is one of us.

710
01:05:55,414 --> 01:05:57,374
Wonderful!

711
01:05:58,166 --> 01:05:59,293
And....

712
01:06:00,043 --> 01:06:03,630
This is my Royal Adjutant,
General Benson.

713
01:06:05,007 --> 01:06:08,051
-How do you do?
-Charmed.

714
01:06:08,302 --> 01:06:10,762
-Your High--
-Let's have lunch.

715
01:06:11,096 --> 01:06:12,598
Thank you, Your Highness.

716
01:06:12,806 --> 01:06:16,018
-I will telephone you.
-Oh, please!

717
01:06:21,523 --> 01:06:23,942
One of my former patients.

718
01:06:24,151 --> 01:06:26,486
Unfortunately, incurable.

719
01:07:06,693 --> 01:07:11,031
Isn't this beautiful?
I can't believe this is happening.

720
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:15,827
Sacrificing his vacation, sharing
his villa. This is incredible!

721
01:07:16,036 --> 01:07:19,748
This is Miss Colgate.
She'll stay at the hotel.

722
01:07:19,957 --> 01:07:22,209
Officer Benson will stay with us.

723
01:07:22,459 --> 01:07:24,795
You are close to my room.

724
01:07:25,003 --> 01:07:27,464
I shall watch you night and day.

725
01:07:27,673 --> 01:07:31,426
May I show you the villa?
It has a fascinating history.

726
01:07:34,763 --> 01:07:36,849
Welcome to hell.

727
01:07:39,101 --> 01:07:42,062
This is so beautiful!

728
01:07:42,271 --> 01:07:45,065
Janet, we haven't discussed
my fee yet.

729
01:07:45,274 --> 01:07:47,276
It will be $50,000.

730
01:07:47,484 --> 01:07:49,903
Yes, I値l have to call my father.

731
01:07:50,112 --> 01:07:53,156
I壇 lower it,
but the clinic won't allow it.

732
01:07:53,407 --> 01:07:54,575
I understand.

733
01:07:54,825 --> 01:07:57,411
-I値l show you the rest of the villa.
-Okay.

734
01:08:04,835 --> 01:08:08,881
-What about Freddy?
-Freddy, go to your room.

735
01:08:10,299 --> 01:08:12,259
I壇 like to come upstairs.

736
01:08:13,302 --> 01:08:15,762
Of course you would. Come on.

737
01:08:17,306 --> 01:08:20,893
-But he can't!
-He can. It's all in his mind.

738
01:08:21,393 --> 01:08:23,228
It seems so cruel.

739
01:08:23,478 --> 01:08:25,898
Trust me. I知 a doctor.

740
01:08:34,406 --> 01:08:37,659
First, I will show you the music room.

741
01:08:41,663 --> 01:08:43,749
Oh, my goodness!

742
01:08:44,249 --> 01:08:46,460
Isn't this beautiful?

743
01:08:46,668 --> 01:08:49,421
I love all these
old musical instruments.

744
01:08:49,630 --> 01:08:53,008
This music box is my favorite. Listen.

745
01:08:55,344 --> 01:08:59,264
In the old days,
people used to dance to this.

746
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:00,682
Come.

747
01:09:13,987 --> 01:09:17,950
I heard the music
and I pulled myself up the stairs.

748
01:09:18,242 --> 01:09:22,955
But then I saw you and him
dancing!

749
01:09:24,164 --> 01:09:28,126
The more he sees us dance,
the more he will get used to it.

750
01:09:30,796 --> 01:09:33,382
It's awful to see us like this,
isn't it?

751
01:09:33,632 --> 01:09:35,509
Janet, you're right.

752
01:09:40,556 --> 01:09:42,349
Now he can't see us.

753
01:09:42,933 --> 01:09:46,019
-This is terrible!
-No pity.

754
01:09:46,228 --> 01:09:47,855
I know this is difficult.

755
01:09:48,063 --> 01:09:52,901
But it's only through our strength
that Freddy will find his.

756
01:10:09,918 --> 01:10:12,588
I have a splendid day
planned for Freddy.

757
01:10:13,088 --> 01:10:16,550
-I need your help to be successful.
-Of course!

758
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:20,387
You will sit here, I will sit here...

759
01:10:21,138 --> 01:10:23,265
...and Freddy will sit there.

760
01:10:25,058 --> 01:10:29,062
Sir. Officer Benson is not
in his room. I found this.

761
01:10:31,064 --> 01:10:32,524
Thank you, Arthur.

762
01:10:37,946 --> 01:10:40,032
What? What does it say?

763
01:10:43,785 --> 01:10:45,579
''I致e lost hope.

764
01:10:45,787 --> 01:10:48,707
Please see that Grandma
gets my insurance...

765
01:10:48,916 --> 01:10:50,751
...and if I am washed ashore...

766
01:10:50,959 --> 01:10:54,755
...that my cremated remains are
tossed in the Suwannee River.''

767
01:10:54,963 --> 01:10:57,716
He's gonna drown himself!

768
01:10:58,926 --> 01:11:01,094
There he is, doctor!

769
01:11:01,303 --> 01:11:03,555
Sit down. Sit down.

770
01:11:03,764 --> 01:11:06,141
It's a bluff to gain sympathy.

771
01:11:11,104 --> 01:11:14,358
Pretend to enjoy yourself.
Laugh out loud.

772
01:11:16,485 --> 01:11:17,861
Louder.

773
01:11:25,369 --> 01:11:27,829
Would you like some strawberries?

774
01:11:28,038 --> 01:11:30,374
Wonderful strawberries!

775
01:11:31,124 --> 01:11:33,293
He's looking. Keep laughing.

776
01:11:34,962 --> 01:11:38,757
Excuse me, the man is here
with your satellite dish.

777
01:11:38,966 --> 01:11:40,884
What satellite dish?

778
01:11:47,349 --> 01:11:48,767
I値l be right back.

779
01:11:51,019 --> 01:11:53,647
What would I want
with a satellite dish?

780
01:12:33,729 --> 01:12:34,771
Oh, my God!

781
01:12:35,022 --> 01:12:36,899
I知 out of control!

782
01:12:40,736 --> 01:12:42,654
I知 out of control!

783
01:12:42,863 --> 01:12:44,489
Oh, my God!

784
01:12:45,073 --> 01:12:46,408
Oh, no!

785
01:13:06,887 --> 01:13:09,097
Freddy! Stop, please!

786
01:13:10,807 --> 01:13:14,561
Don't make me crawl around you.
This sand is too hot.

787
01:13:14,770 --> 01:13:16,897
-Stop where you are.
-Then what?

788
01:13:17,147 --> 01:13:21,485
When you're not looking,
I値l come here and do it right.

789
01:13:21,735 --> 01:13:23,195
Then I won't leave you.

790
01:13:24,404 --> 01:13:26,865
I値l get Dr. Schuffhausen.

791
01:13:30,619 --> 01:13:31,703
Not him.

792
01:13:31,954 --> 01:13:34,456
He hates me. He's torturing me.

793
01:13:34,706 --> 01:13:36,917
He doesn't hate you.

794
01:13:37,501 --> 01:13:41,129
He may seem strict,
but he's just trying to help you.

795
01:13:41,338 --> 01:13:45,592
Don't make me go back.
Can't we stay a little longer?

796
01:13:48,512 --> 01:13:50,055
Well....

797
01:14:01,316 --> 01:14:03,652
Just as I thought.

798
01:14:04,152 --> 01:14:06,947
I知 sorry I was so depressed
this morning.

799
01:14:07,155 --> 01:14:09,575
It's just that last night...

800
01:14:10,033 --> 01:14:12,411
...I had a dream about her.

801
01:14:15,497 --> 01:14:19,918
I remember how I used
to stare at her...

802
01:14:20,502 --> 01:14:25,757
...and just sit
and touch her face like this.

803
01:14:29,803 --> 01:14:31,597
That is so sweet.

804
01:14:31,847 --> 01:14:35,517
-She was the first girl I ever kissed.
-Really?

805
01:14:35,893 --> 01:14:37,769
And now...

806
01:14:38,353 --> 01:14:42,649
...I probably won't kiss
another girl for the rest of my life.

807
01:14:42,858 --> 01:14:45,652
Freddy, that is ridiculous!

808
01:14:45,903 --> 01:14:49,323
You are an attractive, exciting
and sensitive man.

809
01:14:49,531 --> 01:14:53,202
There are a million women
who'd love to kiss you.

810
01:15:01,835 --> 01:15:05,839
I want to ask you a question,
and I want you to be honest.

811
01:15:09,593 --> 01:15:12,179
Am I attractive and exciting to you?

812
01:15:28,403 --> 01:15:30,364
Miss Colgate?

813
01:15:33,075 --> 01:15:34,618
May I talk to you?

814
01:15:37,829 --> 01:15:41,542
-I知 sorry.
-Janet, I am dropping this case.

815
01:15:41,708 --> 01:15:43,210
Please don't!

816
01:15:43,418 --> 01:15:47,047
I shouldn't have done it,
but I felt sorry for him.

817
01:15:47,256 --> 01:15:50,801
You heard the awful story
about his girlfriend.

818
01:15:51,051 --> 01:15:54,304
-How did it make you feel?
-It made me physically sick.

819
01:15:54,513 --> 01:15:57,516
Then please help him. Please, please!

820
01:15:58,433 --> 01:16:00,602
All right. I will.

821
01:16:00,853 --> 01:16:04,815
-Thank you.
-But, Janet, we must hide our pity.

822
01:16:05,232 --> 01:16:08,777
You and I must be his role model.

823
01:16:09,027 --> 01:16:11,321
We must enjoy ourselves so much...

824
01:16:11,530 --> 01:16:15,659
...that Freddy will want to jump out
of the wheelchair and join us.

825
01:16:15,909 --> 01:16:18,245
I値l try, but it won't be easy.

826
01:16:18,745 --> 01:16:21,206
I will be there to help you.

827
01:17:01,371 --> 01:17:04,917
-How much of this can he stand?
-Don't show any pity.

828
01:17:05,167 --> 01:17:07,753
-Look happy.
-Are you sure?

829
01:17:08,003 --> 01:17:09,713
Yes. Come on!

830
01:17:17,012 --> 01:17:20,474
Isn't she fabulous?
Wouldn't you like to dance with her?

831
01:17:21,642 --> 01:17:25,521
What's stopping you?
Get out of that chair and dance.

832
01:17:25,854 --> 01:17:29,858
Okay, if you just want to sit there
and miss all the fun....

833
01:17:44,957 --> 01:17:45,999
Oy, mate!

834
01:17:47,751 --> 01:17:50,587
-Who's the asshole?
-''Get up and dance''?

835
01:17:50,796 --> 01:17:52,673
I壇 like to smack him one.

836
01:18:07,271 --> 01:18:09,439
I wouldn't mind so much...

837
01:18:09,648 --> 01:18:11,984
...but she used to be my girl.

838
01:18:12,901 --> 01:18:16,196
If I could get her alone,
I壇 have a chance.

839
01:18:16,405 --> 01:18:19,324
But he's always around.

840
01:18:25,163 --> 01:18:26,999
I have another idea.

841
01:18:27,207 --> 01:18:29,710
It was love
that put him in that chair.

842
01:18:29,918 --> 01:18:31,920
Perhaps love could get him out.

843
01:18:32,171 --> 01:18:35,007
Would you mind if I gave you a kiss?

844
01:18:35,215 --> 01:18:39,386
-If you think that would help.
-Yes, I think it would help.

845
01:19:05,662 --> 01:19:09,082
-What a piece of shit!
-What do you reckon?

846
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:16,381
There's a plane leaving
for Honduras at 1:00 a.m.

847
01:19:16,590 --> 01:19:19,259
How'd you like him to be on it?

848
01:19:49,122 --> 01:19:53,919
-Good night, Freddy.
-I値l be back. Think happy thoughts.

849
01:20:00,467 --> 01:20:03,846
Doctor, do you think
the therapy is working?

850
01:20:04,096 --> 01:20:07,349
-Yes, I am terribly pleased.
-Good.

851
01:20:08,517 --> 01:20:11,395
I知 sorry for the delay
in paying your fee.

852
01:20:11,603 --> 01:20:13,105
I値l have it tomorrow.

853
01:20:13,355 --> 01:20:16,942
It took longer
than I thought to raise the money.

854
01:20:17,359 --> 01:20:18,819
Raise the money?

855
01:20:18,986 --> 01:20:23,782
The cash prize wasn't enough,
so I had my father sell the car...

856
01:20:23,991 --> 01:20:26,493
...the furniture and all the jewelry.

857
01:20:26,702 --> 01:20:29,204
-What cash prize?
-From the contest.

858
01:20:29,413 --> 01:20:32,###
I was selected
as the United States Soap Queen.

859
01:20:33,250 --> 01:20:36,545
That's why I知 on this
all-expense-paid trip to Europe.

860
01:20:36,753 --> 01:20:40,507
Your father doesn't own
the soap company?

861
01:20:42,259 --> 01:20:46,138
No! I just use their
laundry detergent.

862
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:49,641
I entered their contest
and then I won.

863
01:20:51,643 --> 01:20:54,563
You barely know Freddy...

864
01:20:55,522 --> 01:20:59,484
-...but you'd sell everything for him?
-Not everything.

865
01:20:59,735 --> 01:21:01,069
I知 keeping the mink.

866
01:21:01,361 --> 01:21:03,197
Is that wrong?

867
01:21:03,363 --> 01:21:07,743
Knowing I helped a man
like Freddy live his life again...

868
01:21:07,951 --> 01:21:12,497
...is worth more to me than the car,
the furniture, or the jewelry.

869
01:21:12,748 --> 01:21:15,626
I couldn't ask for more
than that.

870
01:21:16,627 --> 01:21:21,173
I never knew
that people like you existed.

871
01:21:22,925 --> 01:21:25,969
You are generous, sincere.

872
01:21:28,305 --> 01:21:30,682
You are wonderful.

873
01:21:31,892 --> 01:21:33,644
Thank you.

874
01:21:35,521 --> 01:21:38,023
Well, good night.

875
01:21:38,857 --> 01:21:40,275
Good night.

876
01:21:52,496 --> 01:21:56,875
Freddy, get it into your head.
The bet's off. She has no money.

877
01:21:57,084 --> 01:21:59,628
You're trying
to get out of the bet.

878
01:21:59,837 --> 01:22:04,967
If so, fine. Then you lose and
leave town. But she has the money.

879
01:22:05,217 --> 01:22:08,804
-By selling everything she owns.
-She's keeping the mink.

880
01:22:09,012 --> 01:22:12,975
If we take her for everything,
she still has a very nice mink.

881
01:22:13,225 --> 01:22:16,103
The women I deal with
are screened.

882
01:22:16,311 --> 01:22:18,438
They're wealthy and corrupt.

883
01:22:18,647 --> 01:22:21,733
I don't take advantage
of the poor or virtuous.

884
01:22:21,942 --> 01:22:25,779
We'll forget about the money,
but the bet is still on.

885
01:22:25,988 --> 01:22:28,657
-We'll think up a new bet.
-All right, what?

886
01:22:28,866 --> 01:22:31,660
-A completely new bet.
-Think of one.

887
01:22:33,996 --> 01:22:35,956
We'll make her the bet.

888
01:22:36,164 --> 01:22:37,624
What do you mean?

889
01:22:38,750 --> 01:22:40,836
What do you think I mean?

890
01:22:41,044 --> 01:22:43,088
First one to get her into bed.

891
01:22:44,131 --> 01:22:47,593
Don't you ever have an emotion
from above the waist?

892
01:22:47,843 --> 01:22:48,927
No.

893
01:22:49,303 --> 01:22:52,181
I値l tell you something.
This is for certain.

894
01:22:52,472 --> 01:22:56,435
A woman like Janet
would never give herself to you.

895
01:22:58,520 --> 01:22:59,771
What?

896
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:01,940
What?

897
01:23:02,149 --> 01:23:05,611
-You actually believe that?
-I know that, Freddy.

898
01:23:06,445 --> 01:23:09,281
-You wanna bet?
-I値l bet.

899
01:23:09,489 --> 01:23:11,575
But I知 not competing to win.

900
01:23:11,783 --> 01:23:14,203
I知 just betting that you fail.

901
01:23:14,453 --> 01:23:17,039
-Loser leaves town.
-Loser leaves town.

902
01:23:31,512 --> 01:23:33,347
I say.

903
01:23:33,639 --> 01:23:34,640
I say.

904
01:23:35,974 --> 01:23:38,894
-What do you want?
-You're blocking my gate.

905
01:23:39,102 --> 01:23:41,271
See the captain. He's in back.

906
01:23:41,688 --> 01:23:43,232
Now, look here.

907
01:23:47,444 --> 01:23:50,697
-This is private property.
-Just see the captain.

908
01:23:56,662 --> 01:23:57,663
Captain?

909
01:23:58,455 --> 01:23:59,498
Which one of you--?

910
01:24:04,878 --> 01:24:06,171
You'll be all right?

911
01:24:06,380 --> 01:24:09,132
Yeah. She said she'd meet me here.

912
01:24:10,008 --> 01:24:11,343
Wish me luck!

913
01:24:31,572 --> 01:24:35,284
-I thought the doctor took you home.
-Yeah, he did.

914
01:24:35,534 --> 01:24:37,119
I couldn't sleep.

915
01:24:37,953 --> 01:24:41,206
-I have to talk to you, Janet.
-Come in.

916
01:24:44,042 --> 01:24:47,379
I was thinking about what
Dr. Schuffhausen told me.

917
01:24:47,588 --> 01:24:50,966
That I could walk
if the desire was strong enough.

918
01:24:51,258 --> 01:24:53,802
Yes, he told me the same thing.

919
01:24:56,305 --> 01:25:00,267
I think you're the only person
who can give me that desire.

920
01:25:02,269 --> 01:25:04,229
What do you mean?

921
01:25:08,734 --> 01:25:10,319
I love you.

922
01:25:11,195 --> 01:25:15,949
I think I could walk again
if I thought you loved me too.

923
01:25:16,783 --> 01:25:21,538
-I still have this terrible fear.
-What fear?

924
01:25:21,872 --> 01:25:24,458
That my feelings won't be returned.

925
01:25:25,876 --> 01:25:27,961
But your feelings will be returned.

926
01:25:28,170 --> 01:25:31,507
Because I think I love you too.

927
01:25:31,715 --> 01:25:33,258
And you will walk.

928
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:34,968
Here.

929
01:25:35,177 --> 01:25:36,678
What are you doing?

930
01:25:36,970 --> 01:25:40,724
Now stand up
and walk to me.

931
01:25:43,810 --> 01:25:45,896
Come on, you can do it.

932
01:25:48,815 --> 01:25:52,444
-You won't disappoint me?
-No, I won't disappoint you.

933
01:25:54,655 --> 01:25:58,492
Stand up and walk to me.
Please, just try.

934
01:26:05,791 --> 01:26:07,125
Come on.

935
01:26:14,091 --> 01:26:15,968
Let go.

936
01:26:22,516 --> 01:26:24,101
I知 standing.

937
01:26:25,269 --> 01:26:28,021
I知 standing!

938
01:26:28,230 --> 01:26:30,274
Yes! Now walk to me.

939
01:26:31,608 --> 01:26:34,403
-You won't let me down?
-No, I won't.

940
01:26:37,906 --> 01:26:39,199
That's it.

941
01:26:39,366 --> 01:26:40,576
That's it!

942
01:26:40,784 --> 01:26:43,120
Oh, my God! You're doing it!

943
01:26:47,833 --> 01:26:50,836
-Want to rest?
-No, I want to keep trying.

944
01:26:51,044 --> 01:26:52,546
Go stand over there.

945
01:26:52,754 --> 01:26:54,715
-Here?
-By the bed.

946
01:26:54,882 --> 01:26:57,593
-I wonder how far I can go.
-Here?

947
01:26:59,761 --> 01:27:01,471
-Here?
-Yeah.

948
01:27:02,848 --> 01:27:04,433
Walk to me.

949
01:27:04,850 --> 01:27:08,145
-I知 still afraid.
-Don't be afraid.

950
01:27:08,353 --> 01:27:10,439
Don't you want to kiss me?

951
01:27:11,148 --> 01:27:12,274
Yeah!

952
01:27:12,566 --> 01:27:16,570
If you come over here,
I will prove that I love you.

953
01:27:16,820 --> 01:27:18,238
You'll prove it?

954
01:27:18,780 --> 01:27:20,741
Come on. Come on.

955
01:27:22,326 --> 01:27:23,410
You can do it.

956
01:27:23,660 --> 01:27:27,122
Come on. Take a step. That's it!

957
01:27:28,290 --> 01:27:30,250
Yes! Do it!

958
01:27:31,752 --> 01:27:33,337
I made it!

959
01:27:33,587 --> 01:27:35,422
I made it!

960
01:27:35,631 --> 01:27:37,633
Yes, Freddy, you made it.

961
01:27:38,926 --> 01:27:40,677
And all because...

962
01:27:41,303 --> 01:27:43,180
...of your...

963
01:27:43,388 --> 01:27:44,765
...love.

964
01:27:46,725 --> 01:27:48,727
Our love, Freddy.

965
01:27:51,605 --> 01:27:53,148
We all love you.

966
01:27:58,570 --> 01:28:03,075
It's moments like this that
make being a doctor worthwhile.

967
01:28:05,202 --> 01:28:07,829
No wonder they call you a genius.

968
01:28:08,038 --> 01:28:09,957
You said he'd come and he did.

969
01:28:10,165 --> 01:28:12,876
You said he'd walk and he did!

970
01:28:13,085 --> 01:28:17,673
I知 starting to believe this man
can really perform miracles!

971
01:28:19,758 --> 01:28:22,344
I知 beginning to believe it too.

972
01:28:25,931 --> 01:28:28,183
How did you get off that plane?

973
01:28:28,392 --> 01:28:30,060
I never got on it.

974
01:28:30,269 --> 01:28:33,605
-Six sailors were in that truck.
-Seven sailors.

975
01:28:33,814 --> 01:28:36,984
I am a Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve.

976
01:28:38,026 --> 01:28:39,486
Think you got me?

977
01:28:39,695 --> 01:28:43,156
This is the beginning,
now I知 turning on the charm.

978
01:28:43,323 --> 01:28:47,661
No, you're not. I知 taking her
to the airport in the morning.

979
01:28:47,828 --> 01:28:48,996
You failed.

980
01:28:49,204 --> 01:28:53,500
I知 making sure she gets
as far away from you as possible.

981
01:28:54,042 --> 01:28:56,128
How do you plan to do that...

982
01:28:56,336 --> 01:29:01,175
...without me on you like glue?
What are you doing?

983
01:29:03,093 --> 01:29:04,845
Look who's here!

984
01:29:05,345 --> 01:29:09,308
Oh, yes. And he can walk
just like the man said.

985
01:29:09,516 --> 01:29:12,394
Oy, guys! Have a look at this!

986
01:29:16,273 --> 01:29:19,443
Take care of my friend
till I get back.

987
01:29:21,236 --> 01:29:24,239
Plenty more food
and champagne to come.

988
01:29:29,286 --> 01:29:33,290
-Couldn't I just call Freddy?
-No, trust me.

989
01:29:33,498 --> 01:29:37,044
But maybe I love him
and maybe he loves me.

990
01:29:37,252 --> 01:29:39,046
Now that he's cured--

991
01:29:39,254 --> 01:29:42,633
Then it's even more important
to go away for a few weeks.

992
01:29:42,883 --> 01:29:45,844
If a man loves you
he will follow you.

993
01:29:46,053 --> 01:29:48,972
-But how do I know--
-Trust me one last time.

994
01:29:50,974 --> 01:29:52,309
All right.

995
01:29:52,935 --> 01:29:54,895
But what about your fee?

996
01:29:55,062 --> 01:29:58,690
Do what I tell you
and you can keep the fee.

997
01:29:58,899 --> 01:30:01,026
-You're kidding!
-Yes.

998
01:30:01,735 --> 01:30:03,195
You're wonderful.

999
01:30:03,445 --> 01:30:06,406
-Tell Freddy I said goodbye.
-Of course.

1000
01:30:06,615 --> 01:30:07,866
Thanks.

1001
01:30:11,745 --> 01:30:13,580
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.

1002
01:30:22,130 --> 01:30:23,715
-All right, mate?
-Hello.

1003
01:30:25,926 --> 01:30:27,803
-Thanks, mate.
-All right.

1004
01:30:29,763 --> 01:30:32,432
That really happen?
I don't believe that.

1005
01:30:36,770 --> 01:30:39,439
-Gotta go. Take care.
-See you.

1006
01:30:39,648 --> 01:30:41,441
I値l never get that.

1007
01:30:41,608 --> 01:30:43,318
Great guy.

1008
01:30:43,527 --> 01:30:44,903
Bye.

1009
01:30:45,112 --> 01:30:49,199
Well, you seem to be having
a very nice time.

1010
01:30:49,408 --> 01:30:51,201
I had a great time.

1011
01:30:51,493 --> 01:30:55,330
Could you hand me
that Super Glue solvent, please?

1012
01:30:59,501 --> 01:31:01,795
I was on that wall for six hours.

1013
01:31:01,962 --> 01:31:03,922
Goddamn....

1014
01:31:06,258 --> 01:31:09,303
-Well, Freddy, it's over.
-What's over?

1015
01:31:11,096 --> 01:31:12,723
See that plane?

1016
01:31:12,931 --> 01:31:14,975
There goes your bet.

1017
01:31:15,184 --> 01:31:16,935
Janet's on it.

1018
01:31:22,983 --> 01:31:26,403
Have the honor to admit it.
You've lost.

1019
01:31:26,987 --> 01:31:29,531
Go see for yourself. She's gone.

1020
01:31:31,241 --> 01:31:34,453
Have a safe trip
and a prosperous career.

1021
01:32:02,689 --> 01:32:04,816
Janet, it's me, Freddy.

1022
01:32:26,839 --> 01:32:28,382
I lost.

1023
01:32:36,056 --> 01:32:37,516
You're here!

1024
01:32:43,689 --> 01:32:47,484
The doctor said it might endanger
your recovery...

1025
01:32:47,693 --> 01:32:49,486
...but I had to see you.

1026
01:32:49,695 --> 01:32:51,905
I really am in love with you.

1027
01:32:52,072 --> 01:32:53,657
Really?

1028
01:32:54,575 --> 01:32:56,910
You actually love me?

1029
01:33:11,258 --> 01:33:14,052
Now that you're walking, can you...?

1030
01:33:14,261 --> 01:33:15,762
Well...

1031
01:33:16,722 --> 01:33:18,765
...I can try.

1032
01:33:18,974 --> 01:33:21,143
You may not believe this, but...

1033
01:33:21,351 --> 01:33:23,854
...I haven't had much experience.

1034
01:33:24,688 --> 01:33:26,231
Me either.

1035
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:28,483
Could you close the drapes?

1036
01:33:29,443 --> 01:33:31,028
Sure.

1037
01:33:38,702 --> 01:33:40,913
And shut the door?

1038
01:33:41,830 --> 01:33:42,873
Yeah.

1039
01:34:12,819 --> 01:34:14,279
It's Andre, sir.

1040
01:34:18,158 --> 01:34:19,493
Thank you.

1041
01:34:21,495 --> 01:34:23,413
Andre, what a lovely morning!

1042
01:34:23,622 --> 01:34:26,834
Mr. Jamieson, are you lying down?

1043
01:34:27,292 --> 01:34:28,418
What?

1044
01:34:28,627 --> 01:34:32,256
Miss Colgate was seen
returning to the hotel.

1045
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:35,968
-But I took her to the plane.
-She got off.

1046
01:34:37,261 --> 01:34:38,595
Where is Freddy?

1047
01:34:38,804 --> 01:34:41,807
The Jackal is with Miss Colgate.

1048
01:34:42,015 --> 01:34:45,727
They've been in her room
with the curtains drawn.

1049
01:34:48,063 --> 01:34:49,147
For how long?

1050
01:34:49,356 --> 01:34:52,067
Not long. But long enough.

1051
01:34:52,276 --> 01:34:53,694
It is a disaster.

1052
01:34:55,904 --> 01:34:59,658
It seems the teacher has
underestimated the student.

1053
01:35:00,742 --> 01:35:03,537
We must accept defeat graciously.

1054
01:35:03,745 --> 01:35:06,623
I will prepare myself for the Jackal.

1055
01:35:06,832 --> 01:35:10,210
He'll be here soon
to gloat over his victory.

1056
01:35:11,003 --> 01:35:12,796
Thank you, my old friend.

1057
01:35:49,750 --> 01:35:51,543
What's the matter?

1058
01:35:51,752 --> 01:35:55,088
I know what you said,
but I had to see him again.

1059
01:35:55,255 --> 01:35:58,592
-I thought I was in love with him.
-What?

1060
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:00,928
I went back to see him, and....

1061
01:36:01,178 --> 01:36:02,179
And?

1062
01:36:02,387 --> 01:36:03,388
And...

1063
01:36:04,806 --> 01:36:06,892
...we made love.

1064
01:36:09,269 --> 01:36:12,856
I tried to please him,
but how could I have known?

1065
01:36:13,982 --> 01:36:17,110
Then what happened was, I feel asleep.

1066
01:36:17,319 --> 01:36:19,988
When I woke up, he was gone.

1067
01:36:20,489 --> 01:36:25,494
He took all my money, my mink,
my jewelry, my traveler's checks.

1068
01:36:25,702 --> 01:36:28,247
Even my little change purse.

1069
01:36:30,541 --> 01:36:33,377
What kind of a man would do that?

1070
01:36:33,585 --> 01:36:35,629
And do you know what else?

1071
01:36:35,838 --> 01:36:37,714
I think he could walk.

1072
01:36:37,923 --> 01:36:41,134
He pretended this whole thing
to get my money.

1073
01:36:41,343 --> 01:36:44,930
It was all my savings,
the prize money. Everything.

1074
01:36:45,138 --> 01:36:47,599
$50,000!

1075
01:36:49,518 --> 01:36:54,022
-I told you I壇 waive my fee.
-It had already gotten here.

1076
01:36:54,231 --> 01:36:58,610
What will I say to my father?
Some of the money was his.

1077
01:37:02,072 --> 01:37:03,490
Arthur!

1078
01:37:06,201 --> 01:37:07,202
Yes, sir.

1079
01:37:07,411 --> 01:37:11,582
Phone Andre and tell him
to find Officer Benson.

1080
01:37:11,790 --> 01:37:15,294
He has stolen some of
Miss Colgate's property.

1081
01:37:15,502 --> 01:37:17,337
I shall be at the airport.

1082
01:37:17,671 --> 01:37:20,966
Janet, I am going to cover
your losses.

1083
01:37:21,175 --> 01:37:24,052
You and your father
will get your $50,000 back.

1084
01:37:24,261 --> 01:37:28,932
You're taking the first plane out
of here. And make sure you're on it.

1085
01:37:29,141 --> 01:37:32,352
But you're not responsible.
How could you have known?

1086
01:37:32,519 --> 01:37:36,064
A good psychiatrist would have known
he was a charlatan.

1087
01:37:36,273 --> 01:37:39,818
Come. It's cheaper
than a malpractice suit...

1088
01:37:40,027 --> 01:37:41,486
...which you'd win.

1089
01:37:41,695 --> 01:37:46,408
-I can't take your money.
-You can and you will. Take it.

1090
01:37:56,710 --> 01:37:58,253
Janet, come on.

1091
01:38:00,214 --> 01:38:02,716
-You change planes in Paris.
-Okay.

1092
01:38:03,175 --> 01:38:07,679
-I don't feel good taking your money.
-I feel good about it.

1093
01:38:07,888 --> 01:38:11,183
It has been so great to meet you.

1094
01:38:12,851 --> 01:38:15,896
If you're ever in Cleveland,
will you call?

1095
01:38:16,104 --> 01:38:17,689
I will.

1096
01:38:21,235 --> 01:38:23,028
Goodbye.

1097
01:38:23,237 --> 01:38:24,696
Bye.

1098
01:38:31,370 --> 01:38:33,330
Have a good flight.

1099
01:38:33,956 --> 01:38:35,582
Thank you.

1100
01:38:53,725 --> 01:38:57,020
I can't take this.
It doesn't belong to me.

1101
01:38:57,229 --> 01:39:00,858
I値l always have something from you
that means much more.

1102
01:39:01,066 --> 01:39:02,359
Bye!

1103
01:39:05,153 --> 01:39:06,280
Bye!

1104
01:39:10,909 --> 01:39:12,744
Goodbye!

1105
01:39:28,844 --> 01:39:32,931
He was at the hotel,
returning to the scene of the crime.

1106
01:39:33,140 --> 01:39:35,225
What is he talking about?

1107
01:39:35,434 --> 01:39:39,396
Freddy, this time
she really is on that plane.

1108
01:39:39,605 --> 01:39:41,440
You can't harm her again.

1109
01:39:41,648 --> 01:39:44,318
You let her go? You gotta stop her!

1110
01:39:47,529 --> 01:39:50,073
Hold it! Hold it!

1111
01:39:50,282 --> 01:39:51,742
Come back!

1112
01:39:53,285 --> 01:39:54,870
Hold it!

1113
01:39:56,830 --> 01:39:59,374
You idiot! You let her go!

1114
01:39:59,583 --> 01:40:02,836
You didn't have to steal her money.

1115
01:40:03,003 --> 01:40:06,006
I didn't steal her money.
She stole from me!

1116
01:40:06,173 --> 01:40:11,512
She says, ''Close the drapes,
close the door.'' I do it.

1117
01:40:11,678 --> 01:40:15,015
She says, ''Please take a shower.''
So I take a shower.

1118
01:40:15,182 --> 01:40:18,560
I come out, she's gone, my clothes,
my money are gone....

1119
01:40:18,769 --> 01:40:20,938
Even the 2000
francs she gave me!

1120
01:40:21,146 --> 01:40:24,733
You expect me to believe that?
She returned the $50,000.

1121
01:40:24,942 --> 01:40:26,527
What $50,000?

1122
01:40:26,735 --> 01:40:32,074
-The $50,000 you stole from her.
-I didn't steal $50,000 from her.

1123
01:40:45,045 --> 01:40:46,964
There's my clothes.

1124
01:40:55,013 --> 01:40:57,182
''Hello, boys. It was fun.

1125
01:40:57,391 --> 01:41:00,727
I値l miss you. Love, Janet.

1126
01:41:00,894 --> 01:41:02,437
The Jackal.

1127
01:41:02,646 --> 01:41:06,149
P.S. I知 keeping the money.
Is that wrong?''

1128
01:41:14,616 --> 01:41:17,661
Of all the lousy....

1129
01:41:17,870 --> 01:41:20,122
She is disgusting!

1130
01:41:20,330 --> 01:41:23,083
She is lying, deceitful, two-faced.

1131
01:41:23,292 --> 01:41:26,587
She is conniving
and she is dishonest!

1132
01:41:29,047 --> 01:41:30,757
Yes.

1133
01:41:31,508 --> 01:41:34,136
Isn't she wonderful?

1134
01:42:06,877 --> 01:42:08,295
Arthur?

1135
01:42:09,880 --> 01:42:11,924
Sorry I broke your VHS player.

1136
01:42:12,132 --> 01:42:15,761
Give me the model number.
I値l send you a check.

1137
01:42:15,969 --> 01:42:17,513
Oh, shut up.

1138
01:42:36,490 --> 01:42:39,201
Thanks for letting me stay
the extra week.

1139
01:42:45,541 --> 01:42:48,043
I kind of knew
from the beginning.

1140
01:42:48,252 --> 01:42:50,587
''J,'' Janet, ''J,'' Jackal.

1141
01:42:51,255 --> 01:42:53,924
When you think about it, it's obvious.

1142
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:06,979
When was she on to us?

1143
01:43:07,563 --> 01:43:09,857
From the beginning, Freddy.

1144
01:43:10,774 --> 01:43:13,694
She was on to us
from the very beginning.

1145
01:43:14,361 --> 01:43:15,988
She was perfect.

1146
01:43:23,829 --> 01:43:26,999
So, what are you gonna do now?

1147
01:43:28,709 --> 01:43:30,335
Well....

1148
01:43:30,544 --> 01:43:33,255
Things will be quiet around here now.

1149
01:43:34,173 --> 01:43:36,091
Season's over.

1150
01:43:37,176 --> 01:43:39,011
Autumn's coming.

1151
01:43:40,345 --> 01:43:43,140
I値l be shutting up part of the house.

1152
01:43:53,233 --> 01:43:55,068
Goodbye.

1153
01:43:57,112 --> 01:43:58,864
Goodbye, Freddy.

1154
01:44:08,498 --> 01:44:10,167
Wait a minute.

1155
01:44:10,375 --> 01:44:14,087
Hang on. Hold it, hold it!

1156
01:44:14,254 --> 01:44:16,507
Excuse me. Hold it. Excuse me!

1157
01:44:16,715 --> 01:44:17,758
Excuse me.

1158
01:44:18,133 --> 01:44:21,136
Hello, my darlings.
There you are.

1159
01:44:21,345 --> 01:44:24,389
What a hike! Are you kidding
with this gravel?

1160
01:44:24,598 --> 01:44:27,100
These heels weren't made for this.

1161
01:44:27,309 --> 01:44:30,729
Could youse
get the bags up here, pronto!

1162
01:44:30,938 --> 01:44:32,314
Yeah, thank you.

1163
01:44:33,398 --> 01:44:35,400
Now, first...

1164
01:44:35,609 --> 01:44:36,777
...intros.

1165
01:44:36,985 --> 01:44:40,113
Nikos, get over here.

1166
01:44:41,198 --> 01:44:42,491
Come here.

1167
01:44:42,699 --> 01:44:45,285
-All right, Paula.
-Come on, everybody.

1168
01:44:45,494 --> 01:44:47,913
I want you to meet
Mr. Big Stuff.

1169
01:44:48,121 --> 01:44:50,332
He was looking at property
in Florida.

1170
01:44:50,541 --> 01:44:53,836
He goes, ''I want to invest
$16 million someplace new.''

1171
01:44:54,044 --> 01:44:57,047
I say, ''Where?'' He goes, ''Australia.''

1172
01:44:57,256 --> 01:45:00,133
Then it hits me, boom. You kidding me?

1173
01:45:00,342 --> 01:45:03,303
We gotta go meet
Mr. Australia himself.

1174
01:45:03,512 --> 01:45:06,682
He goes, ''Why not?'' I go, ''Why not?''
The group goes:

1175
01:45:06,890 --> 01:45:08,308
''Why not?''

1176
01:45:08,517 --> 01:45:09,852
So here we are.

1177
01:45:10,310 --> 01:45:12,813
So, Nikos Papadropolous...

1178
01:45:13,021 --> 01:45:16,149
...meet Australia's favorite son:

1179
01:45:16,358 --> 01:45:18,235
Chips O'Toole.

1180
01:45:31,582 --> 01:45:33,834
Aren't you gonna say anything?

1181
01:45:36,628 --> 01:45:39,673
G'day, Nikos. How's it going, sport?

1182
01:45:40,424 --> 01:45:41,717
Good on you.

1183
01:45:41,925 --> 01:45:45,596
Chips O'Toole.
Hotels and all from down under.

1184
01:45:45,804 --> 01:45:49,349
You still have any situations
available in Sydney?

1185
01:45:49,558 --> 01:45:50,934
No, it's all gone.

1186
01:45:51,143 --> 01:45:53,770
Never mind.
People drop out, don't they?

1187
01:45:54,521 --> 01:45:58,734
Come up, we'll put some
shrimps on the barbie for you.

1188
01:45:59,818 --> 01:46:01,486
I almost forgot somebody.

1189
01:46:01,904 --> 01:46:06,158
Mr. Junior Partner.
The man Chips can't do without.

1190
01:46:06,366 --> 01:46:09,703
The whiz kid, Randy Bentwick.

1191
01:46:10,412 --> 01:46:12,789
Unfortunately, Randy is a mute.

1192
01:46:14,333 --> 01:46:18,003
All right, everybody get to the house
for a drink.

1193
01:46:18,545 --> 01:46:21,673
You want to refresh
those cocktails, right?

1194
01:46:21,965 --> 01:46:23,800
The ice is melting. Hurry!

1195
01:46:24,134 --> 01:46:27,054
Go up. Follow the path
around the house.

1196
01:46:27,262 --> 01:46:29,598
Keep going. Keep going.

1197
01:46:30,265 --> 01:46:32,476
I値l be right up there.

1198
01:46:39,525 --> 01:46:40,984
Fellas...

1199
01:46:41,193 --> 01:46:44,029
...last year I made 3 million dollars.

1200
01:46:44,238 --> 01:46:47,449
But your $50,000 was the most fun.

1201
01:46:48,951 --> 01:46:50,827
Are you ready?

1202
01:46:52,119 --> 01:46:54,246
Then let's go get 'em.
