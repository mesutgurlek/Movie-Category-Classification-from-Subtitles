1
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,300
Oh boy!
This global warming is killing me!

2
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,300
This
is too hot..the ice age was too cold..

3
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,400
What would it take to make you happy?

4
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,900
This.. I like!

5
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,200
No running Jane! Camp rules..

6
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,200
Make me, Sloth!

7
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,100
Make me...sir!

8
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,300
It’s all about respect...

9
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,400
Sarah. You just ate! Wait an hour!

10
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,000
Hector! No,no! You can't pee-pee there!

11
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,800
Ok,ok! there is fine..

12
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,800
Ashley! Stop picking your...

13
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,200
Pinata!

14
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,500
Stop!

15
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,700
...you're supposed to wear blindfolds!

16
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,100
Ok!

17
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,700
Hey, it's my turn to hit the sloth!

18
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,300
..mine..mine...mine....mine!

19
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,400
Hey! You didn't have any candy in you!

20
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,500
Let’s bury him!!

21
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,200
Hey, hey! Whoah..
Who said you kids can torture the sloth?

22
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,600
Manny, don't squash their creativity..

23
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,700
Hey Manny! Diego!!

24
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,700
My bad mammal jammel!

25
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,600
Wanna give a sloth a hand?

26
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,400
Look.. I opened my camp!

27
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,900
Come forth and sit...

28
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,300
It means camp of Sid!

29
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,500
Congratulations.
You’re now an idiot in two languages..

30
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,500
Shhhh...!

31
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,600
…not in front of the K-l-D-G!

32
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,200
These little guys love me! Right, Billy?

33
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,900
Don’t make me eat you!

34
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,300
Funny, kid!
That's why they're called kids!

35
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,000
I told you Sid..

36
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,400
You’re not qualified to run a camp..

37
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,700
Oh! Since when do qualifications
have anything to do with childcare...?

38
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,600
Besides, these kids look up to me..

39
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,500
I’m a role model to them!

40
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,200
I can see that..

41
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,900
You guys never think I can do anything..

42
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,400
but I’m an equal member of this herd!

43
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,400
I made this herd...!

44
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,000
...and you need
to start treating me with some respect!!

45
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,700
Come on! Sid!

46
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,000
Sid! We were just kidding!!

47
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,500
Hey!

48
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,000
Let's play pin the tail on the mammoth!!

49
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,800
Sid!

50
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,100
Can you stop!

51
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,200
I'm gonna get some respect!!

52
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I’ll show 'em!

53
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,100
And so, in the end..

54
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,500
the little burro reached his mommy..

55
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,800
and they lived happily ever after..

56
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,900
Good job!

57
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,800
Question! Why does the burro go home?

58
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,500
Why doesn't he stay with the rabbit?

59
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,600
Because. He wanted to be with his family

60
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,600
I think he should go with the girl burro!

61
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,300
...That's a better love story!

62
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,800
OK! Well, when you tell
your burro story, that’s what he'll do.

63
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,500
'Burro' is a demeaning name...

64
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,700
Technically, it's called a wild ass!

65
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,000
Fine. The wild ass boy came home...

66
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,700
...to his wild ass mother...

67
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,000
See! That’s why I called it a burro!

68
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,200
Could the burro have a grazing problem?

69
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,800
- That would make him more...relatable..
-Boring!

70
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,600
It’s not believable!

71
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,100
- Do burrows eat their young?
- It's not a very satisfying ending!

72
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,500
Sometimes I throw up!

73
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,100
They lived happily ever after...

74
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,900
You can't get more satisfying than that!

75
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,700
One big happy family!

76
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,400
That’s the way it’s supposed to be!

77
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,900
Then, where's your big, happy family?

78
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,400
Then...the
hungry tiger eat the pesky little kids!!

79
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,600
- You ok, buddy?
- Sure, why not?!

80
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,900
- I just thought you..
- Storytimes over....the end!

81
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,700
- Out of the way! Run for your lives!
- Hey, watch it!

82
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,000
Where's everybody going?

83
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,500
The world's coming to an end!

84
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,200
What are you talking about?

85
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,100
Fast Tony!
He says the world's going to flood!

86
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,400
Folks,
I hold in my hand a device so powerful..

87
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,600
it can actually pull air...

88
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,300
right out of the sky!!

89
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,500
Gather round...gather round!

90
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,900
Pardon me, do you have gills ma'am?

91
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,900
So you can't breathe under water?

92
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,600
My assistant here will demonstrate!

93
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,700
Hey, I can smell the ocean!

94
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,900
What are you doing...?

95
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,200
I can't sell that now...!!

96
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,500
You suck
air through your mouth you moron!!

97
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,200
If you're a pupil
of mine, and I'm starting instruction...

98
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,700
you'll
have plenty of air for eons to come!

99
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,900
Of course, don't stay buried!

100
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,000
Why are you scaring
everybody with this doomsday stuff?

101
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,800
I’m trying to make a living here pal..

102
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,200
It’s all part of my weather forecast!

103
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,200
The 5 day outlook is calling
for intense flooding, followed by..

104
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,400
the end of the world..!!

105
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,900
With a slight chance of patchy sunshine

106
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,100
..later in the week

107
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,600
Come on! Don't listen to him..

108
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,000
Fast Tony
would sell his own mother for a grape!

109
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,500
Are you making an offer?

110
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,400
I mean no! I would not!

111
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,100
Haven’t you heard? The ice is melting!

112
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,400
You see this ground? It's covered in ice

113
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,900
A thousand
years ago it was covered in ice..

114
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,200
A thousand years from now..

115
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,800
it will still be ice!

116
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:39,000
Say, buddy..not to cast aspersions
on your survival instincts, but..

117
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,700
haven't
mammoths pretty much gone extinct?

118
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,800
What are you talking about?

119
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,400
I’m talking
about you being the last of your kind!

120
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,900
Ahh! Your breath smells like ants!

121
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,300
Be as that as it may..

122
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,800
When's
the last time you saw another mammoth?

123
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,500
Ah! Don't pay any attention to him Manny

124
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,200
Mammoths can't go extinct..

125
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,800
they are the biggest things on earth!

126
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,500
What about the dinosaurs?

127
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,200
The dinosaurs got cocky!

128
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,800
They made enemies!
-Look!...

129
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,300
some idiot's going down the eviscerator!

130
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,700
Please tell me that’s not our cue!

131
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:18,700
OK..I'm goona jump on the count of 3!

132
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,900
One.....

133
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Two.....

134
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,600
Sid!
Don't move a muscle! We’re coming up!

135
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,900
jump!..jump!...jump!..jump!..

136
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,300
...jump, jump, jump, jump!

137
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,500
Sorry..

138
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,400
Two and three one thousands...

139
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,200
Two and four one thousands...

140
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,800
Sid!
What are you doing? Get down from there!

141
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,500
No way! I’m going to be
the first to jump off the eviscerator...

142
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,500
And then
you guys are gonna have to start..

143
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,200
showing me some respect!

144
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,300
You jump off this
and the only respect you're gonna get..

145
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,600
is respect for the dead!

146
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,200
Come on Manny! He's not that stupid..!

147
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,100
But, I've been wrong before!

148
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,700
Geronimo!!!

149
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,600
Hey, watch it!

150
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,000
I can't breath...

151
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,100
I think I just coughed up my spleen!

152
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,800
Ahh! Diego! Retract the claws please!

153
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,600
Oh...right...sorry!

154
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,700
You know,
if I didn't know you better Diego..

155
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,700
I'd think you're afraid of the water..

156
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,800
Ok..Ok! Good thing I know you better!

157
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,100
Guys...!

158
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,600
Fast Tony was right..!

159
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,400
everything is melting!

160
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,600
It’s all gonna flood...

161
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,200
Come on! We’ve gotta warn them.

162
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,300
Maybe we can
rapidly evolve into water creatures.

163
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,000
That’s genius, Ed...

164
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,600
Call me 'Squid'.

165
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,200
Gees..this whole thing's a piece of junk!

166
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,000
I can't believe I live here!

167
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,800
What?

168
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,400
I can breathe..

169
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,400
I present you
with this revolutionary gizmo, we call..

170
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,400
Bark!!

171
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,400
It’s so buoyant, it actually floats!

172
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,500
I'll show you something that floats!

173
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,200
Alright.... it's your funeral!

174
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,900
You see!
This is exactly what I’m talking about!

175
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,400
Giant balls of fury larva...

176
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,600
the size of mammoths...

177
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,600
raining from the sky!!

178
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,200
Ahh! Go suck air through a reed!

179
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,300
You gotta listen
to him! He’s right about the flood!

180
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:14,800
I am?

181
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,300
I mean...uh...Yes, I am!

182
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,300
Wait a minute! You're the one who said..

183
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,500
there wasn't going to be a flood!

184
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,000
Why should we listen to you?

185
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,300
Because we saw what’s up there!

186
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,400
The dam's
gonna break. The entire valley is gonna flood!

187
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,600
Flood’s real alright..

188
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,400
and it's coming fast!

189
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,600
Look around! You're in a bowl..!

190
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,700
Bowl's gonna to fill up...!

191
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,600
Ain't no way out...!

192
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:44,900
What are we going to do?!

193
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,300
Unless, you can
make it to the end of the valley..

194
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,500
there's a boat...It can save ya!

195
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,300
I don't see anything..

196
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,300
Fine..

197
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,400
You all better hurry..ground’s melting..

198
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,500
walls tumbling..rocks crumbing..

199
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,900
survive that,
and you'll be racing through water!

200
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,600
coz in 3 days time..

201
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,800
It’s going to hit the geyser fields..

202
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:09,800
Boom!!!

203
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,400
There is some good news though!

204
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,700
The more of you die..

205
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,000
the better I eat!!

206
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,700
I didn't say it was good news for you..

207
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,900
He must have been
a real pleasure to have in class!

208
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,700
Damn!

209
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,800
Alright! You heard the scary vulture..

210
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,700
Let’s move out!

211
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,800
Manny..
Do you really think there's a boat?

212
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,100
I don't know..
But in a few days this place..

213
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,800
is gonna to be a mile under water..

214
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,800
If there's any hope...it's that way

215
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,500
Manny, lets go!

216
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,700
We’ve got an
overturned cliff on the far right lake..

217
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,800
traffic is
packed up as far as the eye can see..

218
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,400
Ohhh! And
it looks like there might be a fatality!

219
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,400
I call the dark meat!!

220
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,100
Come on everybody! Lets go!
Come on. Come..come..come! Get in!

221
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,800
Come on Granpa, come on! We have to go!

222
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,200
Well, I’m not leaving!

223
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,600
I was born
in this hole and I'll die in this hole!

224
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,900
Do we have to bring this crap..?

225
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,600
I’m sure there's crap where we're going!

226
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,700
Ahh! This was a gift from my mother!

227
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,200
- Ok! Keep it moving..keep it moving!
- Manny, Manny!

228
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,000
I've just heard you’re going extinct!

229
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,300
Hey! If you ever master hygiene..

230
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,000
try working on sensativity!!

231
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,800
I’m not going extinct!

232
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,800
Kids! Look...!

233
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,500
The last mammoth!

234
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,600
Well, you probably
won't see another one of those again!

235
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,700
See?!

236
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,300
Where is James?

237
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,000
Stu! Come on! Stu!

238
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,100
Lets blow this ice cube stand!

239
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,100
Stu!!

240
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:58,200
Folks! Be the first in the valley
to have your very own mobile home!

241
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:11,200
Some day, when you're gonna sing..

242
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,300
When you make us sing...

243
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,300
- Shut up Sid!
- Ok!

244
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,700
Stop, hey-hey...What’s that sound..?

245
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:22,400
- All the mammoths are in the ground.
- Stop singing Sid!

246
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:31,600
Sid! I’m gonna fall on you
again! And this time I will kill you!

247
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,200
Ok..someone doesn't like the classics!

248
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,700
What if you're right?

249
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,100
What if I am the last mammoth?

250
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,100
But Manny,
look on the bright side..you have us!

251
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,000
Not your most persuasive argument, Sid!

252
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,600
Mammoths?

253
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,300
I knew I couldn't be the last one!

254
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,000
I felt it in my trunk!

255
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,300
This stinks!

256
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,600
Come on!

257
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,500
Sorry! My stomach...

258
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,500
hates me!

259
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,600
Well...
Don't that put the 'stink' in extinction!

260
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,700
Whooa!

261
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:47,900
Sheesh!!

262
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,000
Oooh....Nasty!

263
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,200
Manny?

264
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,900
I ah..I need to be alone for a while..

265
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:03,200
You go on ahead..I'll catch up!

266
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,400
One truly is the lonliest number...

267
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,600
-Ow!
-Ow!...Hey!

268
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,200
Ohh..these work great!!

269
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,400
Cool!

270
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,800
Missed me...missed me!
Try and come and kiss me!!

271
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,800
I’ll get 'em!

272
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,000
Which end is up?

273
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,700
I dunno..That makes two!

274
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,400
Hey, ugly!

275
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,200
Ow!...I've got to sit on that!

276
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,500
Got you!

277
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,600
Ok! I’m going in!

278
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,600
- Sid!
- What?!

279
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,500
I felt some breeze in that one!

280
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,600
Smile!

281
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,800
Over here!

282
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,200
- Surrender?
- Never!

283
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,300
Cool!!

284
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,200
If any one asks..there were 50 of them..

285
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,300
...And...they were...rattlesnakes!

286
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,900
Here kitty-kitty..

287
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,800
Big mistakes you miscreants!

288
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,300
Miscreants?

289
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,500
Uh..Diego, they're pecking..

290
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,600
Retreat!

291
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,900
I guess it's just you and me now..

292
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,800
I knew it! I knew I wasn't the only one!

293
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,700
Me too! Everyone falls
out of the tree every now and then..

294
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,000
they just don't admit it!

295
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,200
Wait...what?

296
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,100
Some of us
have a tough time holding on to branches

297
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,000
I mean
it's not like we're bats or something..

298
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,300
We don't have wings to keep us up!

299
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:40,600
And you were in the tree..because?

300
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,300
I was looking for my brothers..

301
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,000
They are always getting into trouble..

302
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,600
Brothers? You mean there's more?

303
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,700
Sure!

304
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,600
..lots of us

305
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:51,700
Where?

306
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,000
Everywhere..

307
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,900
under rocks and holes in the ground...

308
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,100
Usually we come out
at night, so birds don't carry us off!

309
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,500
Help! Help!

310
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,400
Well!!
Shave me down and call me a mole-rat!!

311
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,400
You’ve found another mammoth!

312
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,400
Where?

313
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,400
Wait a minute!
I thought mammoths were extinct!

314
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,100
What are looking at me for?

315
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,400
I don't know..

316
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,600
Maybe because you are a mammoth?

317
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,400
Me?!

318
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:27,300
Don’t be ridiculous!
I’m not a mammoth! I’m a possum!

319
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,200
Right, good one! I'm a newt...

320
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,100
This is my friend, the badger..

321
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,500
and my other friend the platypus!

322
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,300
Why do I got to
be the platypus! Make him the platypus!

323
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,000
This guy giving you trouble, Sis?

324
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,000
Sis?

325
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,100
That’s right, these are my brothers..

326
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,700
Possum....Possum....Possum

327
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,300
I don't think her
tree goes all the way to the top branch!

328
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,900
Manny, the brink
of extinction is a bad time to be picky

329
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,200
Hey...She should come with us!

330
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,900
Are you insane? No way!

331
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:04,200
Ok! Manny wants me to ask you if
you'd like to escape the flood with us

332
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,000
What the?

333
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,500
I’d rather be road kill!

334
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,000
That could be arranged!

335
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,400
Ha....funny!

336
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:14,000
Let me
have a little word with my brothers..

337
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,200
Ellie!
Are you crazy? We’re not going with them!

338
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,800
Look! We’ll never make
it in time if we only travel at night..

339
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,800
These guys can protect
us out in the open. What do you say?

340
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,100
- Ow!
- Why did you invite them?

341
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:31,700
Because you might
be the only two mammoths left on earth.

342
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,900
He has a point!

343
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,800
I’m sorry.
When did I join this dating service?

344
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:39,000
My brothers and I
would be delighted to come with you..

345
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:43,000
if...you treat us nicely!

346
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,700
See that!
That’s the total opposite of nice!

347
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:48,400
Maybe we'll have ourselves
a little snack before we hit the road

348
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,000
Want a piece of us? lets go!

349
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,500
Bonsai....!

350
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,700
- I got him!
- Ow!

351
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,200
You know the best part...?

352
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,700
We’re carrying diseases!

353
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,400
Ok! Thanks to Sid...

354
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,000
we're now travelling together...

355
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,400
and like it or not...

356
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,700
we're going to be one big happy family!

357
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,000
I’ll be the daddy..

358
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,800
Ellie will be the mommy..

359
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,500
And Diego will be the uncle
who eats the kids who get on my nerves!

360
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,900
Now let’s move, before the
ground falls out from under our feet!

361
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,700
I thought
fat guys are suppose to be jolly..

362
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:31,900
I’m not fat!
It’s this fur that makes me look big!

363
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,800
It’s poofie!

364
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,300
Ok..he's fat..

365
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,000
Folks! Escape from the flood is a..

366
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,600
perfect time
to shed those unsightly pounds...

367
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,500
with fast Tony's....disaster diet!

368
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,100
You, ma'm!
You look like a big fat hairy beast!

369
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,300
How'd you
like to lose a tonne or two of that?

370
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,900
Would I ever!!..

371
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,900
Don’t listen to him, Vera!

372
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,500
You’re already thin as a twig..

373
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,700
I also have the perfect
cure for your eyesight, my blind friend!

374
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Ohh...We'll never make it at this pace!

375
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:14,000
Ellie, it's ok!
You can lose the camouflage!

376
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,300
You’re safe!

377
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,700
Ok....safe?

378
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,200
Please!! Crash....Eddie...

379
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,500
You two...Go scope it out!

380
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,600
- What you got?
-Perimeter looks to be all clear captain

381
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,500
Roger that..four-niner, over!

382
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,800
Roger. Over!

383
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,700
All clear!

384
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,500
Hawk!!

385
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,200
What are you doing?

386
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,900
Playing dead..!

387
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,300
Manny...Why don't you do that?

388
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,200
Because, I’m a mammoth!

389
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,800
But you do it for treats, right?

390
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,400
Is he gone?

391
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,900
You’re safe! Get up..

392
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,800
Man!...if you weren't here..

393
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,400
that hawk would have swooped down..

394
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,900
and snatched me up for dinner!

395
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,300
That’s how Cousin Wilson went!

396
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,100
Boy, I really feel for you, I do!

397
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,100
I can't
even imagine what it would be like...

398
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,400
to be the last one of your species!

399
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,500
I’m not the last one!

400
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,800
Oh...You brave, brave soul....

401
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,500
that's right, don't give up hope..

402
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:31,900
Ellie?

403
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,200
Look at our footprints....

404
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,600
they're the same shape

405
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,100
Well, how
do I know those aren’t your footprints?

406
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,200
Well...then..

407
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,400
look at our shadows..we match!

408
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,500
You’re right! We’re the same!

409
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,600
You must be part possum!

410
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,800
You wish!

411
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,700
Diego, there are whole continents
moving faster than you...lets go!

412
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,900
We got to catch up with the others!

413
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,500
Hey! Knock it off!!

414
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,900
Oh cry me a river,
blubber tooth tiger. Have some fun!

415
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,800
Can’t you see the ice is thin
enough..without you two wearing it down?

416
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,800
Oh, Diego. The ice may be
thin, but its strong enough to hold...

417
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,300
a ten ton mammoth and a nine ton possum!

418
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:29,200
Ellie...get up!
If you play dead...you'll be dead!

419
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,500
Look at me!

420
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,100
Diego?

421
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,800
Diego!

422
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:59,900
Come on....

423
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,600
Come on!

424
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,400
This may sting a little..

425
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,200
What in the animal kingdom was that?

426
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,200
I don't know,
but from now on...playing safe..!

427
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,100
Water? Not safe!

428
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,000
That.....
was the bravest thing I've ever seen..

429
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,800
It was nothing really, I..

430
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,400
Oh! It's not a compliment...!

431
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,300
To a possum...bravery is just dumb!

432
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,700
Yeah! We’re spineless..

433
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,100
Lily-livered!

434
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,200
Maybe mammoths are going extinct because

435
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,400
they put themselves in danger too often!

436
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,100
Maybe you should run away more!

437
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,400
Good point! Thanks for the advice!

438
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,900
Happy to help!

439
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,700
Do you believe her?..

440
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,900
"Bravery is just dumb!
Maybe you should just run away more.."

441
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,700
She’s infuriating
and stubborn and narrow-minded!

442
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,600
You like her...

443
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,900
I do not!

444
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:01,000
Don’t worry; your secret is safe with me!

445
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:04,000
- Oh...and so is yours..
- What secret?

446
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,600
You know..
...the one where you can't swim

447
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,300
That’s ridiculous!

448
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,600
Fine, but we're
living in a melting world buddy!

449
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:14,100
You’re gonna have
to face your fears...sooner...or later

450
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,900
Ok! Ready Eddie?

451
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:21,300
Set! Let’s roll!

452
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,400
Wait for me!!

453
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,300
Don’t wait....gotta roll...

454
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:39,900
meet you at the other end!

455
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,900
So, you think she's girl for me?

456
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,500
Oh, yeah. She's tons of fun...

457
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,700
and you are no fun at all!

458
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,000
She completes you!

459
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:52,900
Yeah, yeah!!

460
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,700
Hey! Hey, Manny!

461
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,100
Can you pull back the tree...

462
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,600
- and shoot me in the pond?
- No!

463
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Aw...come on..

464
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:03,300
Now..how do you expect
to impress Ellie with that attitude?!

465
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,500
- I don't wanna impress her!
- Then why are you trying so hard to...

466
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,300
...convince her that she's a mammoth?

467
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,100
Because, that's what she is!!

468
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,200
I don't care
if she thinks she's a possum....

469
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,800
You can't be two things!

470
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,700
On contraire.....my...friend!

471
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,400
Tell that to the bullfrog,
the chicken hawk or turtle-dove!

472
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,000
He's never gonna let up on you!

473
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,500
It'll be easier if you just go with it!

474
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,900
So, what you want me to do?

475
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,100
Pull back the tree...

476
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,800
...and shoot me into the pond!

477
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,100
I don't know..

478
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,800
Well, if you are too lame to do it...

479
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,900
- we can get Ellie.
- No..no..no....no..

480
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,000
I can do it, I can do it!

481
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,700
Yeah..yeah. Come on..come on!

482
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,200
Have you done this before?

483
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,200
Ha! Only a million times!

484
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,900
Farther, farther, farther...

485
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,500
Perfect...!

486
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:49,900
Fire!

487
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,200
I can fly...!

488
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,700
I believe I can fly..

489
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,500
Crash!!

490
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,800
Crash, Crash!!

491
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,300
Crash, you ok? What happened?

492
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,400
Manny shot him out of the tree!

493
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,300
What’s wrong with you?

494
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,700
He said he could do it!!

495
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,200
...and you listened to him!

496
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,500
Crash, whatever you do...

497
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,000
don't go into the light!

498
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,600
Can I help in anyway here?

499
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,500
You've done enough!

500
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,300
Are you happy now?

501
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,000
Crash..Crash..don't leave me!

502
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,700
Who's gonna watch my back?

503
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,800
Who’s gonna be my wee man of mayhem?

504
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:45,900
Who’s gonna
roll in that dung patch with me?!!

505
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,300
Dung patch?!

506
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,800
Wait...! My legs...!

507
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,600
I can stand!

508
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:54,300
- He can stand!
- I can run!

509
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,600
- He can run! It’s a miracle!

510
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,000
Hallelujah!

511
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,900
What can I say?... They're boys...

512
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,100
...they make
my life a little adventure!

513
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,000
You guys are so dead!

514
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,600
She's not half bad...

515
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,100
crazy and confused, but..

516
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,600
Sweet!

517
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,400
So?

518
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,100
So what’s holding you back?

519
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,100
My family

520
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,800
You can have that again, you know...

521
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,300
No, Sid. I can't!

522
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:59,500
Ok, ok. But, but, but, think about it!
I mean if you let this chance go..

523
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:03,200
you're just letting your whole speices
go! And that's just...that's just.....

524
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,300
..selfish!

525
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:13,600
I think
I'm starting to get through to him!

526
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,200
Wait, wait! I got you!

527
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,700
Need help?

528
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,500
No, no! Just catching my breath...

529
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,300
- You're stuck.
- I am not!

530
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,100
Alright then, let’s go..

531
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,100
I can't...

532
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,400
I'm stuck!

533
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,200
Don't you think that..

534
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,000
picking them up like this..

535
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
would be easier?

536
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Ellie?

537
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,900
I know this place...

538
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,500
You know....

539
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,400
deep down, I knew I was different..

540
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:39,100
I was a little
bigger than the other possum kids..

541
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,600
Ok, a lot bigger!

542
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:46,800
Oh! Now I
understand why the possum boys..

543
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,900
didn't find me appealing!

544
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:50,100
That’s too bad...

545
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:52,800
Because, as far as mammoths go, you're..

546
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:57,000
- you know...!
- What?

547
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:03,100
Attractive!

548
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:04,600
Really?

549
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,600
- Sure...
- What about me is attractive?

550
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:13,100
Well, I don't know...

551
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:17,600
well...there's you're...uh...

552
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:18,700
butt?

553
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:22,100
What about it?

554
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,700
It’s....

555
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:26,600
big?

556
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:30,200
Oh, you're just saying that!

557
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,300
No, no...

558
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,700
No, I mean it! It's huge..!

559
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,000
biggest darn butt I've ever seen...

560
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,000
Oh...that is really sweet!

561
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,900
What a crazy day!

562
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,700
This morning I woke up a possum...

563
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,500
and now...I'm a mammoth!

564
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,600
Boy, Manny
sure took a big leap with Ellie today...

565
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,700
- He sure did.
- Yup

566
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:41,500
He stood on the shore of uncertainty...

567
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:44,500
and dove right in...Splash!!

568
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,400
Kind of brave, huh...?

569
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,400
the way he faced his...fear!

570
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:49,900
I wouldnt know...

571
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,300
Sabre's don't feel fear!

572
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:53,700
Oh, come on! All animals feel fear..

573
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,500
It’s what separates us from safe!

574
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,900
Rocks! Rocks have no fear...

575
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:00,100
and they sink!

576
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,300
What are you getting at, Sid?

577
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,600
It may surprise you to know that I too..

578
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:07,000
have experienced....fear!

579
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:10,200
- No! You?
- Oh, yes!

580
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,000
As impossible as it seems...

581
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:14,400
the sloth
has natural enemies that would like to..

582
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,100
harm, or otherwise...

583
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:17,600
kill us!

584
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:19,100
I wonder why!

585
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,700
Oh, jealousy mostly. But the point is...

586
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,500
that fear is natural!

587
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:26,600
Fear.....is for prey!

588
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,300
Well then...
You're letting the water make you..

589
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:30,500
it's prey!

590
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:33,100
Just jump in and trust your instincts!

591
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:37,400
You know,
most animals can swim as babies...

592
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:38,600
and for a tiger...

593
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:40,700
It’s like crawling on your belly...

594
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:42,800
to stalk helpless prey!

595
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:45,800
Put that hunt on, ok?!

596
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,900
Now, claw, kick, claw, kick...

597
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,400
I'm stalking the prey!

598
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,400
Claw, kick...now...

599
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,600
I look back over my shoulder..

600
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,000
to see if I am being followed...

601
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:56,200
and I’m breathing!

602
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:00,000
and I'm stalking and I'm stalking...

603
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:03,800
I am falling...

604
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,300
Correction! You're sinking...

605
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,400
kind of like a rock!

606
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,100
Hey, do we do any special tricks like...

607
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,800
roll over? Or do we just...

608
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:18,800
throw our weight around?

609
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:23,400
Sorry,
I don't know my own strength yet!

610
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,700
Ellie, do you realise that...

611
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:28,800
now
we have a chance to save our species?

612
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,900
Really? How are we going to do that?

613
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,600
Well, you know...

614
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,700
-Oh! Uh, uh! Did you just?!
-No...

615
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:37,700
- I didn't mean.
- I'm not a mammoth for five minutes..

616
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:39,200
... and you're hittin' on me?

617
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:40,800
I wasn't saying...

618
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,300
not right now. I'm...

619
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,400
in time...!

620
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:45,300
I was just saying that it’s..

621
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:46,500
our responsibility...

622
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,400
- What?!
- That came out wrong!

623
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:51,700
You're very pretty...

624
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:52,900
But, we just met...

625
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,300
Responsibility...?!

626
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:56,200
Just doing your duty, huh? Is that it?

627
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:58,000
Ready to make the ultimate sacrifice...

628
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,900
to save your species!

629
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,400
Well, I got some news for you..!

630
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,500
You not saving the species tonight...

631
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,300
or any other night!

632
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,500
So, how did it go?

633
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,500
Hmm! Not bad...

634
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,600
Ok, let’s go!

635
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,400
We traveled with you all day...

636
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,200
now you coming with us at night!

637
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,300
but we can't see at night

638
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,500
Then enjoy...the flood!

639
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:37,100
I can't even look at him!

640
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:39,200
Pervert!

641
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,400
Making friends..

642
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:48,300
everywhere you go! Just making friends!

643
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,200
Watch out, there's a stump!

644
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:16,500
Not anymore...

645
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:21,000
I thought we could walk together

646
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:23,600
Crash, ask the man why he thinks that?

647
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:26,000
She said she thinks you are a jerk...

648
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,200
and to go away!

649
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,300
She didn't say...Oww!

650
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,800
Look! Maybe if we spend more time..

651
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:36,800
Tell him that I need
a little personal space right here!

652
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:39,400
She said...go jump in a lake...

653
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,100
and possums rule!

654
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:44,200
I can hear her, you know?

655
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,700
What do you want? A medal?

656
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,200
Stop moving!

657
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:04,000
Thank you!

658
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,700
Manny, Ellie! Lock trunks..!

659
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,100
Now!

660
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,400
Crash, Eddie! Grab onto that ledge!

661
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:34,900
Funny!  And now, what's your real plan?

662
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,200
Just do it!!

663
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,300
- Bye Eddie
- Bye Crash

664
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:40,800
- Bye Ellie
- Go now!

665
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:46,500
I'm sorry..

666
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,200
if what l said before offended you!

667
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,400
What do you mean 'if' it offended me?

668
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,000
"That" it offended her...!

669
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:55,600
"That" it offended her!!

670
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:58,000
I mean "that"..."That" it offended you..!

671
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:03,900
You just overreacted, that's all..

672
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:06,000
What?! Take it back!

673
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,200
There are other lives at stake here!

674
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,600
Wait a minute! He's got a point!

675
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:10,700
He’s got nothing!

676
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:13,200
- It was a misunderstanding!
- It was insensitive!

677
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:14,600
Apologize!

678
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,300
Why me? She overreacted...!

679
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:17,600
Just apologize!!

680
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,100
- No!
- Do it!

681
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:21,200
Ok... I'm sorry!

682
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,200
What?!

683
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,100
He's right. I overreacted

684
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:25,800
You mean, you...?

685
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:27,300
Not another word or I’ll come down there

686
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:29,300
...and push you over myself!

687
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:39,000
Oh Oh!

688
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:43,400
Manny! Ellie! Run!

689
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,800
I guess
we finally did something right together!

690
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:01,700
Hey, don't mind me...

691
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,900
just hanging off the cliff here!

692
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:27,000
Remember the good old days?

693
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:28,300
Which good old days?

694
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:31,600
Oh, you know. Yesterday...last week...

695
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:33,500
Back when the trees when up and down...

696
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,900
and the ground stayed under our feet!

697
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:39,500
Yup! Those were the good days!

698
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:41,800
Possums were possums and...

699
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:43,100
mammoths were mammoths...!

700
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:45,600
We should get some sleep...

701
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:49,400
Yeah, tomorrow is the day
the vulture said we're all gonna die!

702
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:47,000
No, no, no. I dont wan't any....

703
00:54:58,600 --> 00:54:59,500
No, no, no....no...

704
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:08,200
Wait a minute!

705
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:11,100
Can I help you?

706
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:25,100
Hmmm! Now, that’s what I call respect!

707
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:28,900
Nice!

708
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,900
Somebody here likes Sid...!

709
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:40,100
Who is the decorator...?

710
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:42,000
I mean, this is fablulous...!

711
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:50,200
- Fire king..
- Huh?

712
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,300
Fire king?...hmm!

713
00:55:58,300 --> 00:55:59,700
Well. You know, it's about time...

714
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:02,200
someone recognised my true potential!

715
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,000
Let there be fire!!

716
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:17,300
If only the guys could see me now!

717
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,000
This is either really good

718
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,700
or...really bad..!

719
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,400
Oh! No, no, no! Me fire king...

720
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,800
Why kill fire king? A thousand years...

721
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:30,900
bad ju-ju for killing fire king!!

722
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:33,400
Superheated rock from the Earth's core..

723
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,000
is surging to the crust, melting ice...

724
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
built up over thousands of years!

725
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,100
You're a very advanced race. Together...

726
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:40,600
we can look for a solution!

727
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,300
We have one!..Sacrifice the fire king!

728
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,100
Well, thats not very advanced...

729
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:46,100
Worth a shot...!

730
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:06,800
Bad ju-ju!!

731
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,000
Water?  Water!!

732
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:39,600
Crash,
I told you not to drink before bed!

733
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:40,600
I didn't do this...!

734
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,000
At least not all of it!

735
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,600
- What’s happening?
- We overslept...

736
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:46,700
We need to move

737
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:48,900
What if we're last creatures left alive?

738
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:52,000
- We'll have to repopulate the earth!
- How...?

739
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,700
Everyone’s either a dude or a sister!

740
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:56,900
Hi

741
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,300
Hi, hey Manny...

742
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:01,300
Wow, what a night!
You'll never guess what happened to me..!

743
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:03,700
I'm going to go out on a limb
here and say you were sleepwalking

744
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:05,400
Oh, no, no, no. I was....

745
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,300
kidnapped by a tribe of mini-sloths..

746
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:09,300
That was going to be my second guess!

747
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:10,800
and they worship me...

748
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:13,500
I mean sure,
they tossed me into a flaming tar pit..

749
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:15,200
but they worship me!!

750
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:17,700
Sid, you were dreaming! Come on...

751
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:19,400
The water's
rising faster than we're moving!

752
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:21,400
I'm telling you! I was kidnapped...

753
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:23,500
I was worshipped and they...

754
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:26,500
Guys?! Oh, fine!

755
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:35,000
Can we slow down a little...?

756
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:37,400
I'm dying here...

757
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:43,600
It was just a figure of speech!!

758
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,500
They just sit there...

759
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,600
watching us!

760
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,600
I wish l knew what they were thinking...

761
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:02,500
Food, glorious food...

762
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:05,700
we're anxious to try it....

763
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:09,100
Three banquets a day....

764
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:11,900
our favorite diet!

765
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:14,900
Just picture a mammoth steak....

766
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:17,500
- fried, roasted....or stewed....
- Oh....

767
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:19,500
food, wonderful food...

768
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:21,600

770
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:29,100
Food, glorious food...

771
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:32,000
poached possums or flambé!

772
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:34,900
Broth made from a sloth...

773
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:37,800
or savored to soufflé!

774
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,800
Why should we debate it? True...

775
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:42,800
you've nothing, but food!

776
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,300
Oh....foood...

777
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:46,700
magical food, wonderful food...

778
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,200
marvelous foood!

779
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:54,200
Food, glorious food...

780
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:57,000
Flesh, picked off the dead ones!

781
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,700
We're famished for food...

782
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:02,700
soon, we'll be the fed ones!

783
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:05,400
Just thinking of putrid meat...

784
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:07,700
puts us in the mood!

785
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:10,500
Oh, food, glorious food...

786
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:13,000
marvelous food, wonderful food...

787
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000

788
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:18,200
magical food...

789
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:22,200
glorious......

790
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:26,800
Foood!!

791
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:29,700
There...

792
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:31,900
now you know what they were thinking!

793
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:38,100
- Food, glorious food...
- Sid!!

794
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:40,300
What?!  It's catchy!

795
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:56,600
- We made it!
- Yeah, we showed those scary vultures!

796
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:25,000
Oh, it's just a little hot water and steam!

797
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:26,500
How bad could it be?

798
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:35,600
I just did something involuntary...

799
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:37,100
and missed!

800
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:39,300
Ok, come on!

801
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:42,800
Manny! Get back!!

802
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,100
It's a mine field out there!

803
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,300
There's only one way to go...

804
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:48,500
- Straight through!
- Straight through?

805
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:51,100
We'd like to
keep the fur on our bodies, thank you!

806
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:52,500
We'll head back, then we'll go around...

807
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:53,300
Thats safer!

808
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:54,900
No, no! There's no time...

809
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:56,500
the dam will burst before we make it...

810
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:58,600
- We'll drown!
- If we go through this....

811
01:02:58,600 --> 01:02:59,900
we get blown to bits!

812
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,800
- We go forward!
- We go back!

813
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:03,100
- Forward!!
- Back!!

814
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:04,200
- Forward!!!
- Back!!!

815
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:06,200
- Can I say something?
- No!!

816
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:10,200
You are so stubborn and hard headed...

817
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,700
Well, I guess that proves it...

818
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:13,900
I am a mammoth!

819
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:16,500
Come on!

820
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:18,600
Fine!

821
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,500
I don't know! Drowning sounds like a...

822
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:22,000
much gentler way to go...

823
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:23,900
Blown to bits sounds so....

824
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,900
sudden!

825
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:37,800
Ah! He's gonna get himself killed!

826
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:39,300
Manny, wait!

827
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:40,800
Manny?!...

828
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:05,800
"...Kids, look..."

829
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,600
"...the mad mammoth..."

830
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:09,200
"...ends up going extinct..."

831
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:11,200
"...You can't be two things...."

832
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:12,300
"...She thinks your a jerk..."

833
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:13,500
"...and to go away..."

834
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:15,500
"...Where's your big happy family?..."

835
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:17,800
"...What's wrong with you...?"

836
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:21,800
Hey, come on! We got to go..now!!

837
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:29,300
That way!

838
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:12,400
Do not leave your children unattended...

839
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,700
all unattended children will be eaten...

840
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:21,400
- Have you seen a Mammoth?
- No, sorry.

841
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,900
- Have you seen a Mammoth?
- No. No, I haven’t!

842
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:26,400
Possum, about 11 foot tall?

843
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:30,900
Hey, buddy, have you seen a mammoth?

844
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,100
- I sure have...big as life!
- Where?

845
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:34,500
I'm looking at him!

846
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:35,900
Not me!!

847
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:38,800
Poor guy! Doesn’t know he's a mammoth!

848
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:40,200
I don't see her anywhere!

849
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,400
Maybe she is already on board!

850
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:57,400
All right, keep quiet!

851
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:58,300
Come on, get moving!

852
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,100
There it is!!

853
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:03,200
Ellie...!

854
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:14,900
Come on, come on! Run!

855
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Push!!

856
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:27,800
You guys got to go...

857
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:29,100
We're not leaving you!!

858
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,900
- I’m not asking!
- Ellie! No!

859
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:37,600
Ellie, don't worry! We're going for help

860
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:39,100
Stay here!

861
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:58,000
Help us! Somebody help!

862
01:07:58,100 --> 01:07:58,700
Manny!

863
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:01,800
Manny...!

864
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:07,200
Manny...

865
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:09,300
It's Ellie! She's trapped in a cave!

866
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:10,700
Ellie!!

867
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:13,000
Manny?!

868
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,300
Help!

869
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:19,700
I'll save you...!

870
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Great! Who's gonna save him?

871
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:31,600
You really need to brush!

872
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:39,500
Okay, okay, okay! Jump in...

873
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:40,500
Now!

874
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,300
Come on...break it...Come on!

875
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:46,600
You can do this,
you can do this...you can do this!

876
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:48,000
Help!

877
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:50,900
Trust your instincts! Attack the water..

878
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,300
I am not your prey, I am not your prey..

879
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:55,600
I am not your prey!!!

880
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:20,800
Hector...stalking the prey...

881
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:24,100
Come on...kick! Even babies can do it..!

882
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:26,600
Come on...claw...kick...

883
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:28,500
claw...kick...

884
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,500
Hey! I'm stalking the prey!

885
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:38,900
Eddie!

886
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:55,100
You did it buddy...

887
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:57,500
You kicked waters butt!

888
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:00,900
Nothing to it! Most
animals can swim as babies you know!

889
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,600
Yeah, but not tigers...

890
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:04,200
I left that part out!

891
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:20,900
There he is...!

892
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:24,800
Ellie, hold on to me!

893
01:11:56,900 --> 01:11:59,300
Manny! They're behind you!

894
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:39,100
There they are! Yeah!

895
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,500
We thought we'd never see you again!

896
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:06,100
We're gonna live!

897
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:12,400
We're gonna die!

898
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:52,500
Manny...!

899
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:08,400
Well, I’m not leaving!

900
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,800
Granpa,
let go of the boat! The flood is over!

901
01:15:11,900 --> 01:15:13,300
This is my boat now!

902
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:20,500
Hey Stu...we made it! We're gonna live!

903
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Well, I am anyway..

904
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:26,200
- I'm gonna get you...!
- Oh, no you won't...

905
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:28,700
I don't know,
I’m thinkin about startin a swim school!

906
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,900
"Sid's squids"!

907
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,500
All hail, fire king!

908
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:45,300
Uh...Hi?

909
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:47,000
Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi!

910
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:52,400
Fire king avert flood...

911
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:56,200
Join us, oh great and noble flaming one!

912
01:15:56,900 --> 01:15:57,500
Hmmm....

913
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:01,000
Whoa! No, not so fast there, okay?

914
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:03,300
You...you make a quality offer...

915
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:05,700
but fire king has a...

916
01:16:05,700 --> 01:16:06,800
prior committment...!

917
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:09,000
His herd needs him!

918
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:14,300
He is the gooey, sticky, stuff that...

919
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:16,100
holds us together!

920
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:19,400
He made this herd and...

921
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:22,500
we'd be nothing without him!

922
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:24,000
You mean it?!

923
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:29,000
That doesn't mean...want to touch...

924
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:36,200
Don't ask!

925
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:23,600
Whoaaa!

926
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:39,900
We're not the last ones anymore!

927
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:47,200
You're not coming?

928
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,600
You wanna go with them?

929
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:51,700
I am a mammoth...

930
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:54,600
I should probably be with a mammoth...

931
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:56,400
don't you think?

932
01:17:57,700 --> 01:17:59,100
Yeah, unless...

933
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:02,800
Unless..

934
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:07,500
Unless..I...ah...

935
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:11,800
I just wanna say..

936
01:18:13,700 --> 01:18:15,200
I need to tell you..

937
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:20,300
I hope
you find everything you're looking for!

938
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:26,300
You too..

939
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:02,400
Manny...?

940
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:05,900
You've come a long way since we met..

941
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:07,800
and I’ll take full credit for that...

942
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:10,100
But you need to let go of the past...

943
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:12,300
so you could have a future!

944
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:18,300
Go after her!

945
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:19,800
It’s okay...

946
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:22,300
We'll always be here for you..

947
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:24,500
I’ll keep in touch...

948
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:27,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're a good friend..

949
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:30,300
..point made. Now, go on, scat!

950
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:38,600
Our Manny's growing up!

951
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:41,200
Ellie!

952
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:48,200
Manny!

953
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:51,400
Ellie..

954
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,900
I don't want
us to be together because we have to..

955
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:55,700
I want us...

956
01:19:55,700 --> 01:19:57,300
to be together because we want to!

957
01:19:57,400 --> 01:19:59,800
And I wanna be with you, Ellie!

958
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,500
So, what do you say?

959
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:03,700
Oh, Manny..

960
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:05,100
I thought you were going to let..

961
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,200
You're possum enough for me!

962
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:28,200
Well, it's just you and me now...

963
01:20:28,300 --> 01:20:29,700
Two bachelors..

964
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:31,600
knocking about in the wild!

965
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:35,100
Fine, but I’m not gonna carry you...!

966
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:36,600
I still have my pride, you know..

967
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:39,700
Oh, come on, buddy. For old times sake?

968
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,000
I’ll carry him!

969
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:45,600
But you're herd's leaving!

970
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:47,300
We are now!

971
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,500
Manny, who do you like better...?

972
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:53,500
Me or Diego?

973
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:55,100
Diego. Not even close!

974
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:57,300
Ha-ha! Told you!!

975
01:20:57,300 --> 01:20:59,800
Manny!
You can't choose between your kids!!

976
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:02,700
He's not my kid.  He's not even my dog!

977
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:05,900
If I had a dog, and my dog had a kid..

978
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:07,500
..and the dog's kid had a pet...

979
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:08,500
that would be Sid!

980
01:21:08,900 --> 01:21:10,500
- Can I have a dog, Manny?
- No..

981
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:12,600
Ellie, can I have a dog?

982
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:13,600
Of course you can, sweetie!

983
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:14,800
Ellie....

984
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:16,700
We have to be consistent with them!!

985
01:23:36,900 --> 01:23:38,800
I saved you, little buddy!!
