Why didn't you tell me
you thought you were pregnant?

00:00:06,174 --> 00:00:07,574
- I'm not.
- I can respect that

00:00:07,576 --> 00:00:09,412
you didn't want
to talk about it before,

so can you please respect that I
don't want to talk about it now?

It had been a week
since Matty found out

10
00:00:18,392 --> 00:00:20,124
about the pregnancy scare,

11
00:00:20,126 --> 00:00:22,293
and he seemed to be doing
everything in his power

12
00:00:22,295 --> 00:00:24,457
to ensure
we didn't have another.

13
00:00:26,994 --> 00:00:28,227
Is everything okay?

14
00:00:28,229 --> 00:00:29,663
Sure, babe.

15
00:00:29,665 --> 00:00:31,499
He kept insisting
everything was fine,

16
00:00:31,501 --> 00:00:33,201

It was weird.

We weren't talking,
we weren't doing it,

19

we weren't talking

Something is definitely off
in my relationship.

40
00:01:37,694 --> 00:01:39,460
I'd say
it's pretty clearblue easy.

41

Matty's freaked out
over the pregnancy scare.

That's unhealthy.

But even more shocking
than the potential mama drama

is that it came

I'm sorry.

00:02:08,654 --> 00:02:10,454

He "sure-babed" you?

61

"Sure, babe" is one step away

62
00:02:15,062 --> 00:02:16,662
from "whatever, honey,"
which is the gateway phrase

a different way of interfacing,

Matty and I were somewhere
in the middle of the spectrum.

98
00:03:43,392 --> 00:03:46,027
Maybe the way to get us
back on track

99
00:03:46,029 --> 00:03:47,495
was to go back to basics--

100
00:03:47,497 --> 00:03:50,498
sex in a forbidden place,

101
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,033
where one of us was likely
to come out

102
00:03:52,035 --> 00:03:54,369
the other end needing
a tetanus shot.

103
00:03:54,371 --> 00:03:55,904
But it was worth the risk

104
00:03:55,906 --> 00:03:58,006
because the make out
had stopped the freak out.

105

With Matty and me,
getting some action

We're not convinced
there was any foul play.

We are just trying
to get some clarity.

155
00:05:58,173 --> 00:06:01,341
There was evidence of, uh,

sexual nature at the scene.

157

478
00:18:39,428 --> 00:18:41,095
What's going on?

479
00:18:41,097 --> 00:18:43,898
Last week you didn't want me
to touch you,

480
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:48,703
and then today you wanted
to do it in the sanctuary.

481
00:18:50,405 --> 00:18:51,505
Are you upset
that I didn't tell you

482
00:18:51,507 --> 00:18:53,073
about the pregnancy sitch?

483
00:18:53,075 --> 00:18:55,842
No, I'm upset
that you told Jake before me.

484
00:18:55,844 --> 00:19:00,347
And that we don't have
that thing you and Jake had.

485
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:01,781
- Have.
- What thing?

486
00:19:01,783 --> 00:19:03,583
- A friendship?
- I guess, yeah.

487
00:19:03,585 --> 00:19:05,018
Why can't we have that?

488
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,753
- Why can't I be that for you?
- Be what?

489
00:19:06,755 --> 00:19:08,088
The guy you don't
have to sleep with

490
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:09,456
to be connected to, Jenna.

491
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:13,826
The guy
you can say anything to.

492
00:19:13,828 --> 00:19:16,128
I'm sorry I told Jake.

493
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:19,198
He was just there,
and it came out.

494
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,699
That is exactly the point.

495
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,667
It's always so easy with Jake.

496
00:19:22,669 --> 00:19:25,604
Why is it not easy with me?

497
00:19:30,042 --> 00:19:34,146
I guess I'm just always afraid

498
00:19:34,148 --> 00:19:36,748
the minute anything bad happens,
you're gonna run away.

499
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,450
Why would you think that?

500
00:19:38,452 --> 00:19:40,185
Because you were
embarrassed of me.

501
00:19:40,187 --> 00:19:41,954
When?

502
00:19:41,956 --> 00:19:43,822
After we first had sex.

503
00:19:43,824 --> 00:19:45,190
We never talked.

504
00:19:45,192 --> 00:19:46,558
We just hooked up.

505
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,960
And then when we did talk,

506
00:19:47,962 --> 00:19:50,629
it was only in private.

507
00:19:50,631 --> 00:19:53,125
I'd call that embarrassment,
wouldn't you?

508
00:19:56,504 --> 00:19:58,837
No.

509
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:02,008
I was never embarrassed of you.

520
00:20:32,341 --> 00:20:34,540
Hey, so my dad called
your parents and told them

521
00:20:34,642 --> 00:20:36,708
we're having sex.
Gotta go, bye.

522
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:40,312
What do you have to say
to Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton?

523
00:20:40,314 --> 00:20:42,215
Everyone's talking about
how your parents are broke.

524
00:20:42,217 --> 00:20:44,116
I was totally ready
to do it with you,

525
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:45,451
but I was waiting on something.

526
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:46,786
Right now,
I am too excited to wait.

527
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:47,887
What?

528
00:20:47,889 --> 00:20:50,900
- I'm ready, okay?
- Okay.
