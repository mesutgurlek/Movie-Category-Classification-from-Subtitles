2
00:00:03,135 --> 00:00:04,852
So, what have you
been up to?

3
00:00:04,854 --> 00:00:06,637
I started a new
software company

4
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:08,405
with my old partner
Billy Stanhope.

5
00:00:08,407 --> 00:00:10,590
You really think we can finally
build the electric suitcase?

6
00:00:10,592 --> 00:00:12,309
Yes. We have the technology now.

7
00:00:12,311 --> 00:00:13,927
Something you should know.

8
00:00:13,929 --> 00:00:15,362
It's about your ex-wife.

9
00:00:15,364 --> 00:00:16,480
What, Bridget?

10
00:00:16,482 --> 00:00:18,065
Yeah. I'm, uh...

11
00:00:18,067 --> 00:00:19,700
kind of sleeping with her.

12
00:00:19,702 --> 00:00:21,452
What?
Wait! Hey!

13
00:00:24,456 --> 00:00:25,839
Morning.

14
00:00:25,841 --> 00:00:28,942
It's 2:00 p.m.

15
00:00:28,944 --> 00:00:29,943
So?

16
00:00:29,945 --> 00:00:31,628
It's Saturday; I slept in.

17
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:33,497
It's Sunday.

18
00:00:33,499 --> 00:00:35,165
Really?

19
00:00:35,167 --> 00:00:36,550
That's disturbing.

20
00:00:36,552 --> 00:00:40,287
So what did you do last night
that you had to sleep all day?

21
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:41,638
One thing at a time.

22
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,591
I'm still trying to figure out
what happened to Saturday.

23
00:00:44,593 --> 00:00:46,977
Jake, you're gonna graduate
high school in a few days.

24
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:48,095
Don't you think it's time

25
00:00:48,097 --> 00:00:49,396
to start getting
your life together?

26
00:00:49,398 --> 00:00:50,931
I will if you will.

27
00:00:50,933 --> 00:00:52,433
What?

28
00:00:52,435 --> 00:00:54,801
I will certainly
consider that, Father.

29
00:00:54,803 --> 00:00:55,986
This is serious.

30
00:00:55,988 --> 00:00:57,771
You will never amount to
anything if you sleep all day.

31
00:00:57,773 --> 00:00:58,972
WALDEN:
Morning.

32
00:01:03,611 --> 00:01:05,579
I'm sorry, I was distracted

33
00:01:05,581 --> 00:01:07,414
by the naked billionaire
that just woke up.

34
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:11,001
Shut up and eat
your damn cereal.

Man, I did not think Jeremy
was ever gonna stop talking.

40
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:33,083
Yeah.

41
00:01:33,085 --> 00:01:36,552
That guy really puts the "dict"
in "valedictorian."

42
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:39,239
Thinks he's so great just
'cause he's going to Harvard.

43
00:01:39,241 --> 00:01:40,774
Where is Harvard anyway?

44
00:01:40,776 --> 00:01:43,910
Dude, didn't you learn
anything in high school?

45
00:01:43,912 --> 00:01:46,746
It's the capital of Connecticut.

46
00:01:46,748 --> 00:01:48,731
Are you sure?

47
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:49,749
Yeah.

48
00:01:49,751 --> 00:01:51,267
Harvard, Connecticut.

49
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,370
What'd you think
was the capital of Connecticut?

50
00:01:54,372 --> 00:01:56,405
"C."

51
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:59,292
(laughs)

52
00:01:59,294 --> 00:02:00,760
You're an idiot.

53
00:02:00,762 --> 00:02:02,745
I don't know why
I hang out with you.

54
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:03,780
'Cause you're gay.

55
00:02:03,782 --> 00:02:05,098
Well, what does that make you?

56
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,350
Attractive.

57
00:02:09,687 --> 00:02:12,472
So are your parents giving you
a hard time about your "future"?

58
00:02:12,474 --> 00:02:13,589
Oh, yeah.

59
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:14,858
Both my mom and my dad.

60
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,276
I'm sick of hearing it.

61
00:02:16,278 --> 00:02:19,529
Yeah. "If you're not going to
college, you need to get a job""

62
00:02:19,531 --> 00:02:21,981
Where do they
get this stuff?

63
00:02:21,983 --> 00:02:24,150
Beats me.

64
00:02:27,404 --> 00:02:29,605
So what are we gonna do?

65
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:31,708
About what?

66
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,460
Our future.

67
00:02:33,462 --> 00:02:35,278
Oh.

68
00:02:37,114 --> 00:02:40,600
I could go for
some frozen yogurt.

69
00:02:40,602 --> 00:02:41,918
Good idea, man.

70
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,969
Let's go.

71
00:02:42,971 --> 00:02:45,338
Should we take
our robes off?

72
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,506
No, no, leave them on.

73
00:02:46,508 --> 00:02:48,725
They'll attract smart chicks.

74
00:02:51,178 --> 00:02:53,847
Come on, Judith.
He's your son too.

75
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:57,650
I have videotape of him
shooting out of your body.

76
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:00,270
Yes, I've talked to him

77
00:03:00,272 --> 00:03:03,072
about his lack of plans,
but it's like talking to a wall.

78
00:03:03,074 --> 00:03:07,494
A very good-natured,
but dense wall.

79
00:03:07,496 --> 00:03:11,948
Of course I'm concerned,
but what do you want me to do?

80
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:15,318
No, I'm not gonna ask Walden
to give him a job.

81
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,872
Because it would
be an imposition.

82
00:03:18,874 --> 00:03:23,510
Yes, more of an imposition
than me living there for free.

83
00:03:23,512 --> 00:03:26,796
Okay, okay, if it'll get you
to shut up, I'll ask him.

84
00:03:28,766 --> 00:03:32,168
She's never
gonna shut up.

85
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,169
Okay, okay.

86
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,503
Good-bye, Judith.

87
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:35,638
(scoffs)

88
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,525
I am so thankful
I have you in my life.

89
00:03:38,527 --> 00:03:40,643
What about my son?

90
00:03:40,645 --> 00:03:42,178
What about him?

91
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,014
You're gonna ask Walden for a
job for Jake, but not Eldridge?

92
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,284
Of course not.

93
00:03:48,286 --> 00:03:51,304
I was just gonna hold Eldridge
back to sweeten the deal.

94
00:03:56,794 --> 00:03:59,112
BILLY:
I have a question.

95
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:00,446
What?

96
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:03,666
Why didn't you order
adjustable chairs?

97
00:04:03,668 --> 00:04:06,052
I did.

98
00:04:06,054 --> 00:04:08,037
Mine's adjustable.

99
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,138
Well, wait.

100
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,539
How'd you do that?

101
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,259
This lever right here.

102
00:04:13,261 --> 00:04:15,094
I don't have a lever.

103
00:04:15,096 --> 00:04:16,512
Hmm?

104
00:04:16,514 --> 00:04:18,848
Well, that's too bad,
you being so short and all.

105
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:22,101
You did this to get back at me.

106
00:04:22,103 --> 00:04:23,519
I don't know
what you're talking about.

107
00:04:23,521 --> 00:04:25,405
For sleeping with your ex-wife.

108
00:04:25,407 --> 00:04:28,508
Do you really think
that I am so petty

109
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:32,528
that I would pay a chair
manufacturer an extra $480

110
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:36,866
to remove the adjustable
height feature?

111
00:04:36,868 --> 00:04:40,236
That is crazy talk.

112
00:04:41,422 --> 00:04:44,841
How's everything down there
at the Lollipop Guild?

113
00:04:48,929 --> 00:04:50,513
Hey, guys.

114
00:04:50,515 --> 00:04:51,798
Am I interrupting?

115
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,682
Hey, Alan.

116
00:04:52,684 --> 00:04:54,300
Just thought
I'd bring you by

117
00:04:54,302 --> 00:04:56,769
a little office-warming
dieffenbachia.

118
00:04:56,771 --> 00:04:59,188
Ah, thank you.

119
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,140
Looks like you got the place
up and running.

120
00:05:01,142 --> 00:05:02,392
We're getting there.

121
00:05:02,394 --> 00:05:03,759
Electric Suitcase, Inc.

122
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:07,596
Very, very impressive.
(laughs)

123
00:05:09,066 --> 00:05:10,683
What can I do for you?

124
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:13,236
Oh, nothing. I just came
to drop off my gift

125
00:05:13,238 --> 00:05:14,570
and wish you well.

126
00:05:14,572 --> 00:05:15,872
Okay.

127
00:05:17,157 --> 00:05:18,908
Okay, well, I'll get out
of your hair.

128
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,210
Uh, nice to see
you again.

129
00:05:21,212 --> 00:05:23,296
Yep. Always thrill.

130
00:05:24,465 --> 00:05:25,665
Oh, there is one thing.

131
00:05:25,667 --> 00:05:28,051
Here we go.
Here we go.

132
00:05:28,053 --> 00:05:31,220
Um, you know Jake
just graduated high school.

133
00:05:31,222 --> 00:05:33,339
Oh, hey, I'm sorry I couldn't
make it to the ceremony.

134
00:05:33,341 --> 00:05:35,141
Oh, don't be silly.
No one expected you to.

135
00:05:35,143 --> 00:05:36,292
You know what?
Here...

136
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:39,345
why don't you give this
to him for me.

137
00:05:39,347 --> 00:05:41,147
Ooh, a hundred dollars.

138
00:05:41,149 --> 00:05:43,666
I will make sure he gets this.

139
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,272
What? I-I don't
even know the kid.

140
00:05:49,274 --> 00:05:50,773
Oh, of course not.
(laughs)

141
00:05:50,775 --> 00:05:52,909
Um, anyway, I was
just wondering, um,

142
00:05:52,911 --> 00:05:55,978
since you've started
this exciting venture

143
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,480
and obviously you're hiring,

144
00:05:57,482 --> 00:06:00,166
that there might be
an opportunity here for Jake.

145
00:06:00,984 --> 00:06:02,452
He's not going to college?

146
00:06:02,454 --> 00:06:04,587
Not unless he's
delivering pizzas.

147
00:06:04,589 --> 00:06:06,205
Uh, probably true,

148
00:06:06,207 --> 00:06:07,823
but he has a good heart,

149
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:10,159
and I'm afraid if I
can't find him a decent job,

150
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,844
he might have to sell it.

151
00:06:11,846 --> 00:06:13,963
Okay, listen, Alan, I'm sorry.

152
00:06:13,965 --> 00:06:15,381
I-I like Jake,

153
00:06:15,383 --> 00:06:18,801
but I just don't think
we have anything for him here.

154
00:06:18,803 --> 00:06:20,053
Oh, oh, okay.

155
00:06:20,055 --> 00:06:22,271
I understand.
You know, he's just my kid.

156
00:06:22,273 --> 00:06:23,639
Our future. But, um,

157
00:06:23,641 --> 00:06:26,309
but thanks anyway.

158
00:06:26,311 --> 00:06:27,527
Oh, wait, wait.
Hold it, hold it.

159
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:28,861
Yeah? Yeah?

160
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:31,898
Does he know anything
about computers at all?

161
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,450
Not per se,
but he is eager to learn.

162
00:06:34,452 --> 00:06:37,286
He's like a sponge when it comes
to soaking up information.

163
00:06:37,288 --> 00:06:39,856
No, he isn't.

164
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:42,191
Will you at least give me
the sponge part?

165
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,876
Yeah, if you lay him
on a wet spot,

166
00:06:43,878 --> 00:06:45,795
he might absorb liquid.

167
00:06:46,863 --> 00:06:48,581
Why are you being
such a jerk, man?

168
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:49,916
Let's give
the boy a shot.

169
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:51,134
Billy,

170
00:06:51,136 --> 00:06:53,336
I've seen this kid spend
an entire afternoon

171
00:06:53,338 --> 00:06:56,539
smoking dope and trying
to lick his own nipples.

172
00:06:56,541 --> 00:07:00,176
Who amongst us
hasn't... done...

173
00:07:00,178 --> 00:07:03,346
Look, we will...
we will take him on, okay?

174
00:07:03,348 --> 00:07:06,349
Billy...
He'll be my responsibility.

175
00:07:06,351 --> 00:07:07,934
Oh, thank you so much.
You will not regret it.

176
00:07:07,936 --> 00:07:11,687
Yes, you will.
I will send him right over.

177
00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:12,989
Oh, one more thing,

178
00:07:12,991 --> 00:07:15,274
uh, my girlfriend's son
needs a job too,

179
00:07:15,276 --> 00:07:16,692
but you're gonna love him,
he's...

180
00:07:16,694 --> 00:07:18,077
blonde. Bye.

181
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,231
Okay, I'm telling you
right now,

182
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,834
this is a bad idea.

183
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,421
How did you do that?

184
00:07:28,423 --> 00:07:30,873
I don't know what
you're talking about.

185
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,047
Okay, fellas...

186
00:07:38,049 --> 00:07:39,715
this is the heart and soul

187
00:07:39,717 --> 00:07:41,384
of The Electric Suitcase.

188
00:07:41,386 --> 00:07:42,918
300 state of the art,

189
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,604
high bandwidth servers

190
00:07:44,606 --> 00:07:46,422
all working
in tandem.

191
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,024
Cool.
Awesome.

192
00:07:48,026 --> 00:07:49,275
Any questions so far?

193
00:07:49,277 --> 00:07:50,759
Uh, yeah.
Is there a cafeteria

194
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:52,361
or do we order in?

195
00:07:53,614 --> 00:07:55,815
There's a cafeteria
on the 14th floor.

196
00:07:55,817 --> 00:07:57,533
Oh. Cool.
I got a question.

197
00:07:57,535 --> 00:07:58,234
Yes?

198
00:07:58,236 --> 00:07:59,768
Do they have donuts?

199
00:08:00,937 --> 00:08:02,905
Was I lying?

200
00:08:02,907 --> 00:08:05,875
I don't know if I have donuts.

201
00:08:05,877 --> 00:08:08,294
That's okay.
It's not a deal-breaker.

202
00:08:08,296 --> 00:08:09,545
Glad to hear it.

203
00:08:09,547 --> 00:08:10,797
Uh, okay, guys...

204
00:08:10,799 --> 00:08:13,132
all you have to do
between now

205
00:08:13,134 --> 00:08:14,634
and 8:00 tomorrow morning,

206
00:08:14,636 --> 00:08:18,838
is watch the lights
on these servers, all right?

207
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,056
If a green goes to red,

208
00:08:20,058 --> 00:08:21,774
it means the drive
is about to fail

209
00:08:21,776 --> 00:08:22,925
so all you do...

210
00:08:22,927 --> 00:08:25,061
you pop it out

211
00:08:25,063 --> 00:08:26,729
and you replace it

212
00:08:26,731 --> 00:08:29,131
with a fresh one
from right here.

213
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,900
Got it. No problem.
All right.

214
00:08:30,902 --> 00:08:33,703
Oh, and there's no smoking dope
in this building.

215
00:08:33,705 --> 00:08:35,137
No, sir.
Absolutely not.

216
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:37,657
Not <i>inside</i> the building.

217
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:39,942
Or outside the building.

218
00:08:39,944 --> 00:08:41,511
How about the roof?

219
00:08:41,513 --> 00:08:42,778
No.

220
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,680
What about before
we come to work?

221
00:08:44,682 --> 00:08:45,681
No!

222
00:08:45,683 --> 00:08:47,216
What about brownies?

223
00:08:47,218 --> 00:08:50,253
There's no pot, period!

224
00:08:50,255 --> 00:08:53,656
No brownies, no God, no roof,
no outside, no inside.

225
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,758
No problem.
All right.

226
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,910
Good.

227
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:00,179
Oh, and we just want
to take this opportunity

228
00:09:00,181 --> 00:09:02,515
to thank you both for
this great opportunity.

229
00:09:02,517 --> 00:09:04,851
'Cause let's face it,
it is an opportunity.

230
00:09:04,853 --> 00:09:07,353
And it's great.
Opportunity.

231
00:09:07,355 --> 00:09:10,273
Remember, this is on you.

232
00:09:11,692 --> 00:09:12,692
Oh, and on a personal note,

233
00:09:12,694 --> 00:09:14,026
thank you
for the graduation money.

234
00:09:14,028 --> 00:09:15,828
It's my pleasure.

235
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:18,364
A kid my age can always
use an extra 50 bucks.

236
00:09:23,704 --> 00:09:25,238
You know,

237
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,823
I kind of like this whole
"working for a living" thing.

238
00:09:27,825 --> 00:09:29,275
It feels good, you know?

239
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,626
Responsible, grownup.

240
00:09:30,628 --> 00:09:31,978
Absolutely.

241
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,964
All right, we have
successfully downloaded

242
00:09:34,966 --> 00:09:37,583
40,000 hours of porn.

243
00:09:37,585 --> 00:09:40,336
That's a lot to watch
two minutes at a time.

244
00:09:40,338 --> 00:09:42,154
I just hope Billy
and Walden don't notice

245
00:09:42,156 --> 00:09:43,906
that we're using
their hard drives.

246
00:09:43,908 --> 00:09:46,676
Don't worry. I've labeled
every movie "personal."

247
00:09:46,678 --> 00:09:48,311
Oh. Good thinking.

248
00:09:48,313 --> 00:09:50,730
Oh, red light. I got it.

249
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,368
Nicely done.

250
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:57,720
We got this job nailed, my man.
Yeah.

251
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:58,854
And the best part is,

252
00:09:58,856 --> 00:10:00,923
we are in on the ground floor
of the company.

253
00:10:00,925 --> 00:10:02,942
(beeps)
Oh, another one.

254
00:10:02,944 --> 00:10:04,277
Allow me.

255
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:06,696
Maybe they'll give us
stock options and we'll be rich.

256
00:10:06,698 --> 00:10:08,114
What exactly is a stock option?

257
00:10:08,116 --> 00:10:10,333
It's a call option on the
common stock of a company,

258
00:10:10,335 --> 00:10:12,451
issued as a form
of cash compensation.

259
00:10:12,453 --> 00:10:13,736
If the company stock rises,

260
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,338
the holder of the option

261
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,924
generally experiences
a direct financial benefit.

262
00:10:17,926 --> 00:10:20,026
Where'd you learn that?

263
00:10:20,028 --> 00:10:23,078
Wikipedia.
It's not just for term papers.

264
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,098
The point is,
we're gonna be rich.

265
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,683
(beeps)
Oh, another one.

266
00:10:27,685 --> 00:10:30,252
Cool. So we'll have
our own planes

267
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:32,355
and yachts and chicks.

268
00:10:32,357 --> 00:10:34,223
And tons of pot.
Chicks with pot.

269
00:10:34,225 --> 00:10:35,441
Chicks with pot in bikinis.

270
00:10:35,443 --> 00:10:36,726
Naked chicks with pot.

271
00:10:36,728 --> 00:10:37,893
On a yacht.

272
00:10:37,895 --> 00:10:40,079
I like that a lot.

273
00:10:40,081 --> 00:10:41,147
Uh-oh.

274
00:10:41,149 --> 00:10:42,832
That's not good.

275
00:10:42,834 --> 00:10:44,841
Yeah. Why are they all
going bad at the same time?

276
00:10:44,866 --> 00:10:45,902
I don't know.

277
00:10:45,903 --> 00:10:47,653
It's like there's
some sort of virus.

278
00:10:47,655 --> 00:10:49,938
Like the kind you get
when you download too much...

279
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,941
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.

280
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,060
Maybe we should call Billy!

281
00:10:54,062 --> 00:10:55,944
No, we can do this!

282
00:10:57,898 --> 00:10:59,448
Okay, we can't do this.

283
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,734
Call Billy!
Call Billy!

284
00:11:01,736 --> 00:11:03,252
Hello?

285
00:11:03,254 --> 00:11:04,971
Billy, it's Jake.

286
00:11:04,973 --> 00:11:07,456
(hissing)

287
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,177
I just want to start once again

288
00:11:11,179 --> 00:11:13,763
by saying how grateful we are
for this opportunity.

289
00:11:13,765 --> 00:11:15,147
It's great.

290
00:11:28,258 --> 00:11:31,827
How did this happen?

291
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:34,045
Oh, I... I don't know.

292
00:11:34,047 --> 00:11:37,666
Well, faulty wiring
or, uh, cheap hardware...

293
00:11:37,668 --> 00:11:39,334
Definitely not
a porn virus.

294
00:11:39,336 --> 00:11:40,335
Shut up.

295
00:11:40,337 --> 00:11:41,636
How could you guys do this?

296
00:11:41,638 --> 00:11:43,471
I went out on a limb for you.

297
00:11:43,473 --> 00:11:44,472
I believed in you.

298
00:11:44,474 --> 00:11:45,456
Well, thank you.

299
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47,625
It was... it was a
wonderful opportunity.

300
00:11:47,627 --> 00:11:48,977
Oh, great opportunity.

301
00:11:51,597 --> 00:11:53,982
So, when do we get paid?

302
00:11:53,984 --> 00:11:55,934
(chuckles wryly)

303
00:11:55,936 --> 00:11:57,018
Okay.

304
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,271
Yeah, you can't.
I know their parents.

305
00:12:02,608 --> 00:12:04,609
Hey. What are you guys
doing here?

306
00:12:04,611 --> 00:12:07,329
I thought your shift
didn't end till 8:00 a.m.

307
00:12:07,331 --> 00:12:08,663
Well, we got done early.

308
00:12:08,665 --> 00:12:10,332
Oh. Everything go okay?

309
00:12:10,334 --> 00:12:11,616
I was kind of worried

310
00:12:11,618 --> 00:12:13,802
you might burn the whole place
down or something.

311
00:12:13,804 --> 00:12:16,755
Well, it wasn't "or something."

312
00:12:21,777 --> 00:12:24,779
How am I supposed to find jobs
in the next 24 hours?

313
00:12:24,781 --> 00:12:26,214
Beats me.

314
00:12:26,216 --> 00:12:27,849
It's like our parents
are clueless

315
00:12:27,851 --> 00:12:29,868
about how bad
the economy is.

316
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:32,020
Yeah.

317
00:12:32,905 --> 00:12:34,306
You know what,

318
00:12:34,308 --> 00:12:36,308
instead of working
for someone else,

319
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:38,143
we should start
our own business.

320
00:12:38,145 --> 00:12:39,811
I like that.

321
00:12:39,813 --> 00:12:42,480
We could find some
adventure capitalists

322
00:12:42,482 --> 00:12:45,033
and become, um--
what do you call--

323
00:12:45,035 --> 00:12:46,534
entrepraneers.

324
00:12:46,536 --> 00:12:48,820
Yeah. It's not like we
don't have our own good idea.

325
00:12:48,822 --> 00:12:50,538
We have great ideas.

326
00:12:53,242 --> 00:12:57,045
Hey, maybe we can put other
food on a stick and sell it.

327
00:12:57,047 --> 00:13:00,632
Yeah. Pizza on a stick.

328
00:13:00,634 --> 00:13:01,532
Pizza sticks.

329
00:13:01,534 --> 00:13:02,200
Pie.

330
00:13:02,202 --> 00:13:03,368
Pie sticks.

331
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:04,502
Fish.

332
00:13:04,504 --> 00:13:08,206
Yeah, what are we
going to call those?

333
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,208
Fish-sicles!

334
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:11,559
Genius!

335
00:13:11,561 --> 00:13:12,727
Yeah.

336
00:13:12,729 --> 00:13:14,512
MAN:
Excuse me.

337
00:13:14,704 --> 00:13:16,038
Did I hear you guys say

338
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,372
you're looking for jobs?

339
00:13:17,374 --> 00:13:18,524
Yeah.

340
00:13:18,526 --> 00:13:19,925
Why?

341
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:38,126
Maybe it's me.

342
00:13:38,128 --> 00:13:40,035
I'm an idiot magnet.

343
00:13:40,037 --> 00:13:41,587
ALAN:
Hey.

344
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,810
Yup.

345
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:49,950
Hi.

346
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,117
How you doing?

347
00:13:51,119 --> 00:13:52,652
Not so good.

348
00:13:52,654 --> 00:13:54,987
Yeah, yeah, we heard,
and we're so, so sorry.

349
00:13:54,989 --> 00:13:56,339
So, so very sorry.

350
00:13:56,341 --> 00:13:58,574
Yeah, well, thank God
the files are backed up

351
00:13:58,576 --> 00:14:00,526
and insurance will cover
most of the damage.

352
00:14:00,528 --> 00:14:01,711
That's great news!

353
00:14:01,713 --> 00:14:02,862
Yes. Phew!

354
00:14:02,864 --> 00:14:04,380
(laughing)

355
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:11,421
You do realize that
your children are not normal.

356
00:14:11,423 --> 00:14:15,374
Well, yeah, but, you know,
what's normal?

357
00:14:15,376 --> 00:14:16,893
And-and in Jake's defense,

358
00:14:16,895 --> 00:14:18,561
he never would have done
anything like this

359
00:14:18,563 --> 00:14:20,680
unless, uh, you know.

360
00:14:20,682 --> 00:14:22,849
(chuckling nervously)

361
00:14:22,851 --> 00:14:25,017
"You know" what, Alan?

362
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:27,153
Well, I didn't want to,
you know, say anything

363
00:14:27,155 --> 00:14:29,605
but, uh, but clearly there's
a bad influence involved here.

364
00:14:29,607 --> 00:14:31,607
I mean, I don't want
to point any fingers,

365
00:14:31,609 --> 00:14:34,560
but, uh, his name rhymes
with "smeldridge."

366
00:14:34,562 --> 00:14:35,978
(Lyndsey scoffs)

367
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:38,331
Oh, my God.

368
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,082
You-you can't be serious.

369
00:14:40,084 --> 00:14:42,418
My son had never been in trouble
in his life

370
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,036
until he met your son.

371
00:14:44,038 --> 00:14:45,338
Never been in trouble?

372
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,506
He tried
to counterfeit money

373
00:14:46,508 --> 00:14:48,341
with a computer
and an inkjet printer.

374
00:14:48,343 --> 00:14:50,543
The government dropped
the charges.

375
00:14:50,545 --> 00:14:52,545
Only because
there's no such thing

376
00:14:52,547 --> 00:14:54,413
as a $25 bill.

377
00:14:54,415 --> 00:14:56,382
LYNDSEY:
Yeah? Yeah? Well,

378
00:14:56,384 --> 00:14:58,017
well, what about when Jake stole
your brother's Mercedes

379
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:00,136
and lost it in Topanga Canyon?

380
00:15:00,138 --> 00:15:01,604
He didn't steal it.
He borrowed it.

381
00:15:01,606 --> 00:15:03,756
And he was only driving it
because my brother was drunk

382
00:15:03,758 --> 00:15:06,225
and someone had to take
his hooker home.

383
00:15:07,611 --> 00:15:10,730
In Topanga Canyon,
which is where she lived.

384
00:15:10,732 --> 00:15:12,615
You are always making excuses
for him.

385
00:15:12,617 --> 00:15:14,000
And you don't excuse Eldridge?

386
00:15:14,002 --> 00:15:15,985
LYNDSEY: Hey, he went through
a very rough divorce.

387
00:15:15,987 --> 00:15:17,203
ALAN:
And Jake didn't?

388
00:15:17,205 --> 00:15:19,789
LYNDSEY: Well, at least your
wife traded up.

389
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,073
Wh-what is that supposed
to mean?

390
00:15:21,075 --> 00:15:23,626
Really?
That was too subtle for you?

391
00:15:25,546 --> 00:15:28,080
Hey, everybody, good news.

392
00:15:28,082 --> 00:15:29,916
You don't have to worry
about us finding work.

393
00:15:29,918 --> 00:15:31,217
You-you got a job?

394
00:15:31,219 --> 00:15:32,752
Yeah. It's not
just a job though.

395
00:15:32,754 --> 00:15:35,054
It's an adventure.

396
00:15:35,056 --> 00:15:36,973
What?

397
00:15:36,975 --> 00:15:40,125
We're gonna be
all we can be.

398
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:44,830
Oh, oh, no-no, you didn't.

399
00:15:44,832 --> 00:15:46,065
We didn't what?

400
00:15:46,067 --> 00:15:47,483
Join the Army.

401
00:15:47,485 --> 00:15:50,469
Yeah, we joined the Army.
How'd you know?

402
00:15:52,105 --> 00:15:55,575
You need to listen to me.

403
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,429
They are not normal.

404
00:16:07,704 --> 00:16:09,789
Uh, hiya.

405
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:11,207
Hi.

406
00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:12,425
Looking for a new career?

407
00:16:12,427 --> 00:16:14,677
Um, I'm 44 years old.

408
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:15,845
That's okay.

409
00:16:15,847 --> 00:16:17,663
Today's Army is all-inclusive.

410
00:16:17,665 --> 00:16:20,933
You can be as old and as gay
as you want.

411
00:16:20,935 --> 00:16:23,853
Uh, well,
that's-that's good to know.

412
00:16:23,855 --> 00:16:26,355
Um, uh, but I-I actually wanted
to talk to you

413
00:16:26,357 --> 00:16:28,608
about my son, Jake Harper.

414
00:16:29,476 --> 00:16:31,310
Harper. Harper.

415
00:16:31,312 --> 00:16:33,779
Oh, yeah,
wants to be a drone pilot.

416
00:16:33,781 --> 00:16:34,864
Yeah, he told me.

417
00:16:34,866 --> 00:16:36,198
He thinks it's like
a video game.

418
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,400
Oh, it is.

419
00:16:37,402 --> 00:16:38,851
It's exactly like a video game.

420
00:16:38,853 --> 00:16:41,370
Except we blow up real people.

421
00:16:41,372 --> 00:16:44,290
Yeah, actually, that's what
I wanted to talk to you about.

422
00:16:44,292 --> 00:16:45,324
Um,

423
00:16:45,326 --> 00:16:46,492
I love my son,

424
00:16:46,494 --> 00:16:47,743
uh, but more importantly,

425
00:16:47,745 --> 00:16:50,079
I love my country,

426
00:16:50,081 --> 00:16:53,082
uh, which is why
I don't think my son

427
00:16:53,084 --> 00:16:56,035
should have access
to flying bombs.

428
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,538
Or really any kind of weapon.

429
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,040
I mean, between you and me,

430
00:17:01,042 --> 00:17:03,426
I've seen him try to pick up
spilled food with a fork

431
00:17:03,428 --> 00:17:05,261
and stab himself in the leg.

432
00:17:05,263 --> 00:17:07,013
And not just once.

433
00:17:07,015 --> 00:17:10,349
I understand your concern,
but our training is unsurpassed.

434
00:17:10,351 --> 00:17:12,234
We take boys
and turn them into men.

435
00:17:12,236 --> 00:17:14,053
I know you think that...

436
00:17:15,405 --> 00:17:17,890
...but you don't know him
like I do.

437
00:17:17,892 --> 00:17:19,492
He's 18, right?
Yeah.

438
00:17:19,494 --> 00:17:21,911
Not currently on probation
or under indictment?

439
00:17:21,913 --> 00:17:24,163
No.
Is this his signature?

440
00:17:24,165 --> 00:17:25,247
Yeah.

441
00:17:25,249 --> 00:17:26,415
Then if he passes the physical,

442
00:17:26,417 --> 00:17:29,368
he's signed, stamped,
and off to camp.

443
00:17:30,203 --> 00:17:32,872
I see.

444
00:17:32,874 --> 00:17:35,207
Oh, look, al-Qaeda!

445
00:17:36,076 --> 00:17:38,427
It's just a copy!

446
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,263
Hey, guys, you like video games?

447
00:17:46,186 --> 00:17:47,970
Congratulations, Jake.

448
00:17:47,972 --> 00:17:50,690
I know I'm only your stepdad,
but I'm real proud of you.

449
00:17:50,692 --> 00:17:52,475
Thanks, Herb.
Were you ever in the Army?

450
00:17:52,477 --> 00:17:55,111
Well, the KISS Army.

451
00:17:57,064 --> 00:17:58,898
But I don't think
that really counts.

452
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,067
You think Mom's ever gonna
stop crying

453
00:18:01,069 --> 00:18:02,267
before I go?

454
00:18:02,269 --> 00:18:03,552
(sobbing quietly)

455
00:18:03,554 --> 00:18:05,604
My guess is no.

456
00:18:05,606 --> 00:18:07,540
Don't worry, Mom.

457
00:18:07,542 --> 00:18:08,824
I'll be fine.

458
00:18:08,826 --> 00:18:09,959
I'm a grown man now.

459
00:18:09,961 --> 00:18:11,794
No, you're not.

460
00:18:11,796 --> 00:18:13,946
You're my bigheaded baby.

461
00:18:13,948 --> 00:18:16,165
(sobbing)

462
00:18:16,167 --> 00:18:19,468
(piano playing
"Pop! Goes the Weasel")

463
00:18:32,966 --> 00:18:34,567
So, Berta,
are you gonna miss me?

464
00:18:34,569 --> 00:18:36,352
Nah, why should I miss you?

465
00:18:36,354 --> 00:18:38,487
You're just an extra
toilet to clean.

466
00:18:38,489 --> 00:18:40,990
That is, when you
hit the toilet.

467
00:18:40,992 --> 00:18:44,393
(piano playing
"Pop! Goes the Weasel")

468
00:18:57,607 --> 00:19:00,126
Don't worry, Grandma.
I'll make you proud of me.

469
00:19:00,128 --> 00:19:03,345
I've always been proud
of you, darling.

470
00:19:03,347 --> 00:19:05,131
In my own way.

471
00:19:05,133 --> 00:19:08,751
(piano playing
"Pop! Goes the Weasel")

472
00:19:22,315 --> 00:19:24,316
Thanks for everything.

473
00:19:24,318 --> 00:19:27,403
Come here.

474
00:19:27,405 --> 00:19:31,190
(piano playing
"Pop! Goes the Weasel")

475
00:19:36,713 --> 00:19:38,330
Look at
the bright side, Dad.

476
00:19:38,332 --> 00:19:39,999
You won't have
to buy me clothes anymore.

477
00:19:40,001 --> 00:19:41,667
They're gonna give me
a dress uniform,

478
00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:44,536
a work uniform, and even one
for when I'm tired.

479
00:19:44,538 --> 00:19:46,138
What?

480
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,674
Yeah, they call 'em "fatigues."

481
00:19:48,676 --> 00:19:51,376
I don't know why they just
wouldn't call 'em pajamas.

482
00:19:51,378 --> 00:19:53,979
Oh, my son, my son.

483
00:19:53,981 --> 00:19:57,266
(piano playing
"Pop! Goes the Weasel")

484
00:20:18,004 --> 00:20:20,589
You be a good boy,
and you do what you're told,

485
00:20:20,591 --> 00:20:22,424
and promise me
you'll be careful.

486
00:20:22,426 --> 00:20:23,876
Don't worry about me.

487
00:20:25,128 --> 00:20:28,380
Worry about
our nation's enemies.

488
00:20:32,102 --> 00:20:34,270
