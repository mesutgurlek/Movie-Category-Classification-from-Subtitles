being raised in the Church.

164
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:22,860
Uh, actually, we decided to wait
until they're old enough

165
00:07:22,944 --> 00:07:24,403
and then just let them decide.

166
00:07:25,154 --> 00:07:26,906
Hell it is, then.

00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:40,044
Hi. Is Jared in?

169
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:41,545
- Are you a patient?
- Sister.

170
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:43,506
JANE: Oh. Oh. Right.

171
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:45,299
- Hi, I'm Jane.
- Hi.

172
00:07:45,383 --> 00:07:47,802
He's in a delivery,
so you can wait over in the Daddy's Room

173
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:49,178
and I'll let him know that you're here.

174
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:50,596
Okay.

175
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:52,932

- Thank Christ.

181
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:06,696
Are you freaking kidding me?

182
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:09,365
We're in a hospital.

184
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,077
Right. Sorry.

185
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:15,204
Just practicing.

186
00:08:15,663 --> 00:08:17,957
I don't even smoke. I quit a month ago.

187
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,250
It's a girl.

188
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,794
Oh, my God. I gotta call you back.
Is she...

189
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:23,461
They're both doing just fine.

190
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:24,543
Would you like to meet her?

00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:48,779
Sorry. Jared'll be in in a sec.

197
00:08:48,863 --> 00:08:50,156
My hero.

198
00:08:50,448 --> 00:08:51,490
He's a sweetie, huh?

199
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:52,700
Hmm.

200
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:57,246
I hope this isn't too inappropriate to ask,

201
00:08:57,496 --> 00:09:00,166
but is it true that he's
never really had...

202
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:01,500
It's true.

203
00:09:02,168 --> 00:09:03,169
Oh.

204
00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:05,503
Okay. What kind of a doily

passes out in the Daddy's Room?

- Thank you.

Thank you. (HUMMING)

00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:16,807
She's perky.

210
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:19,268
Who, Jane? Yeah, she's great.

211
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:20,728
She's screaming for a shot at the title.

212
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:21,812
Nice.

213
00:09:21,896 --> 00:09:23,416
What could possibly be wrong with her?

214
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:27,860
I am so over this whole
fresh-faced, Ivy League,

215

Don't you have to be under one first?

00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:32,530
Good one.

218
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:33,574
She knows, by the way.

219
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:34,867
Yeah. A bunch of us went out

220
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,535
for too many margaritas last month.

221
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,997

un-virgin pool going.

What?

223
00:09:41,165 --> 00:09:44,085
A bevy of hot nurses
are conspiring to bang your brains out?

224
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:45,503
You should press charges.

225
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:49,340
No, not my brother. He's
gotta wait for love.

226
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:50,548
Yeah, well...

227
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:52,927
It seemed like
a really noble idea when I was 15.

228
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,096
Anyway, I'm starting to waver.

229
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:56,472
Shut up.

230
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,890
No, I'm gonna be 30 soon.

231
00:09:57,973 --> 00:10:00,558
But then that would mean
that I've wasted the last

232
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,228
15-plus years.

233
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:04,438
You're fine.

234
00:10:04,522 --> 00:10:06,564
Well, call what's-her-name back in here.

235
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:07,900
Come on. You can use my bed.

236
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:10,444
I'll wait in the hall. I
can laugh really quietly.

237
00:10:10,528 --> 00:10:13,447
Or I could just
put you back in there with the babies.

00:10:13,531 --> 00:10:14,573
No.

Oh.

247
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,468

almost painted over that

263
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:17,178
while we were redecorating.

264
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:20,639
I had my knitting needle to his throat
when Donald pulled me off of him.

Yeah.

00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:26,896
You were so wonderful to them.

Well, they're not
officially my kids, but, you know...

God, you look stunning.

Cut the crap, Bebes.
I look a decade older and so do you.

Said the one of us not
wearing control tops.

272

Wait until you see Muffin. Oh, my God.

273
00:11:44,455 --> 00:11:45,748
I heard she had work done.

Really, like, somebody said it was scary.

275
00:11:48,042 --> 00:11:51,212
Well, let's just say most of her face
is now behind her ears.

00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:52,975
(LAUGHING)
- And she's completely mental.

277
00:11:53,047 --> 00:11:55,466
She's driving me crazy
about the details of the wedding,

278
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:57,718
which is ironic because
we're hosting it here.

279
00:11:57,801 --> 00:11:58,802
- Right.
- Right?

280
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:00,930
And I'm catering it. Organic, of course.

281

Oh, God, I was just so
terrified to see you.

Oh, don't be.
I mean, look, it was a long time ago.

- This house?
- Yeah?

287
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:19,365
It looks absolutely incredible.

288
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:21,367
When were you two married, anyway?

289

Oh, we weren't. I don't need a ring.

290

I mean, maybe
I'd like to have a ring some time, but...

You should tell him.

through the deep end

00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:52,147
I truly loathe this place.

302
00:12:52,231 --> 00:12:56,734
Oh. Is that because you've hooked up
with, like, half the staff?

303
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:58,536
It was high school.
And hand jobs don't count.

304

Oh, thank God.

You look gorgeous.

Oh, so do you.
Oh, my God, your hair, I love it.

00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:07,162
- Thanks.
- I'm so glad you're here.

308
00:13:07,246 --> 00:13:08,746
- Sister.
- Immigrant.

309

- Ambulance chaser.
- Partner.

310
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:14,628
Hey, good for you. Where's Andrew?

311
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:17,089
- Oh, God.
- Are you okay?

312
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:19,341
- I gotta sit down.
- Come. Come.

313
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:22,760
She's drunk already?

314
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:25,681
Mild concussion. This should be fun.

315
00:13:27,308 --> 00:13:29,810

soon as we got engaged,

316
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:33,147
it suddenly dawned on them
that he's not Caucasian.

317
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,606
Wait, you're not Caucasian?

318
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:35,899
Not at the moment.

319
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:37,359
JARED: Well, that's upsetting.

320
00:13:37,443 --> 00:13:39,278
They're, like,
putting on this whole dinner theater,

321
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:41,196
PC act, pretending to be really cool,

322
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,656
but really they're freaking out

323
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,781
that they're gonna have beige grandkids.

324
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:45,103

You look breathtaking.

You've packed on a few.

I'm not feeling so hot right now.

I really don't feel well.

Vietnam and Cambodia.

368
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,882
Yeah. We suggested Venice,
but we don't count.

369
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:26,844
Because it's safer.

370

But also, of course, because Venice
is Alejandro's native language.

Oh, really?
Is she as traditional as your mother?

I think so. She's extremely shy. So...

Well, listen to me.

to raise our kids Catholic

475
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:41,138

perform the ceremony?

00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,877
It's just, it's... It's kind of a big one.

487
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:12,170
(MUMBLING)

488
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:14,756
Don? Oh, my God!

489
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,842
Do you know what your son just told me?

490
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:18,427
- Huh?
- Oh, my God.

491
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:21,178
You know how the Catholics
have this thing about divorce?

492
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:23,682
Well, it turns out that Madonna

493
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:25,892
is under some sort of ridiculous impression

494
00:20:25,976 --> 00:20:28,562
that divorce is a great big, fat sin.

495
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:29,646
Who's Madonna?

496
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:32,149
AI's biological mother! What are you, nuts?

497
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,190
I'm not listening.

498
00:20:33,191 --> 00:20:34,591
And she's also under the impression

499
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:38,530
that of all the big, fat divorce sinners
in this whole big, wide world,

500
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:40,907
you and I are not among them.

501
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,534
- Uh...
- Don?

502
00:20:42,617 --> 00:20:44,202
Can you even hear what I'm saying?

503
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:46,329
- Not remotely.
- We're not divorced!

504
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:48,123
- Got it?
- What?

505
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:50,751
For the next three days,
you and I are husband and wife.

506
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:52,002
- What?
- Yes!

507
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:53,920
Shit! (SCREAMS)

508
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:55,422
(ELLIE SCREAMS)

509
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:57,215
Don!

510
00:21:00,177 --> 00:21:02,220
I feel terrible.

511
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:06,975
They're just letting
anyone into Harvard these days, huh?

512
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:10,020
And you never told her
about them because...

513
00:21:10,854 --> 00:21:13,231
I mean, there was no way
she was ever gonna come here.

514
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:16,109
It never even occurred to me
until that Pre-Cana.

515
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:17,319
ELLIE: - Well, wait a minute.
- Oh.

516
00:21:17,402 --> 00:21:19,529
What would happen if she knew the truth?

517
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:21,948
You told me what she put you
through during the adoption.

518
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:25,243
She gave up her only son so that I
could have a chance at a better life.

519
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:26,411
And now, she left Colombia,

520
00:21:26,495 --> 00:21:28,789
which she swore
she would never do. On an airplane,

521
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:29,956
which she's petrified of,

522
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,666
only to find out that
I've been lying to her

523
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,834
about being raised by heathens

524
00:21:32,918 --> 00:21:34,336
for the past 15 years.

525
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:36,421
- No offense.
- None taken.

526
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:38,590
It'd break her poor little heart.

527
00:21:38,673 --> 00:21:40,842
Why don't we just fake it
for a of couple days? No big deal.

528
00:21:40,926 --> 00:21:43,303
ELLIE: And what makes either of you
think you could pull this off?

529
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:47,057
Sweetie, there's just
one little part that I'm stuck on.

530
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,266
If those two are still married,

531
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:51,144
then what does that make me?

532
00:21:54,773 --> 00:21:55,899
My concubine?

533
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,070
I hadn't really gotten there yet.

534
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:01,488
- I see.
(CUTLERY CLATTERS)

535
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,281
All right.

536
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,743
More tea, anyone?

537
00:22:08,578 --> 00:22:10,287
I thought my life was a shit storm.

538
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:11,623
I feel awful.

539
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:13,507
Well, then what the hell
are you waiting for?

540
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:17,629
This is gonna go great.

541
00:22:17,712 --> 00:22:20,552
Before we start shitting kittens,
why don't we just sit the old gal down

542
00:22:20,632 --> 00:22:22,509
and lay it all out for her?
You and I are divorced.

543
00:22:22,592 --> 00:22:24,803
It's not like we moved
to a fucking petting zoo or something.

544
00:22:24,886 --> 00:22:26,721
ELLIE: She's from another country.

545
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:28,098
A very different country.

546
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:29,850
And her values aren't the same as ours.

547
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:31,434
So just pretend to be
married for the weekend.

548
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:32,519
What's the big deal?

549
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:33,923
Where would you like me to start?

550
00:22:33,979 --> 00:22:35,939
Hey, listen. You were no Mardi Gras, toots.

551
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:37,065
What did you call me?

552
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:38,525
DON: Let's get that straight. Oh.

553
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:40,026
And it's an expression. It's an expression.

554
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,362
Of endearment.
So don't get all Jane Fonda about it.

555
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:44,321
ELLIE: Uh-huh. Well, you know, the Tibetans

556
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:45,322
have a wonderful expression

557
00:22:45,323 --> 00:22:46,366
for moments like these as well.

558
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:47,450
Yeah?

559
00:22:47,534 --> 00:22:50,327
Loosely translated,
it means, "Go fuck a yak, Don."

560
00:22:50,328 --> 00:22:53,123
That's the moment. I finally feel home.

561
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:54,332
So, she's leaving.

562
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:56,751
Some apology.
What is the matter with you? Why can't...

563
00:22:56,835 --> 00:22:57,961
She won't listen to me.

564
00:22:58,044 --> 00:22:59,336
She's not going anywhere.

565
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:01,131
Honey, this is all very dramatic.

566
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:02,716
- Can't we just...
- Put a sock in it, Donald.

567
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,885
Let me help you with this.

568
00:23:04,968 --> 00:23:06,469
Let's go in the kitchen,
let's have some tea...

569
00:23:06,553 --> 00:23:08,972
- You hate my tea.
- I love your tea.

570
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:10,265
BEBE: Really?
DON: Okay, okay.

571
00:23:10,348 --> 00:23:12,349
I do hate your tea.
But the rest of you is pure perfection.

572
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:14,561
- Just take the suitcase.
- Honey, please. Look...

573
00:23:14,644 --> 00:23:15,979
ALEJANDRO: Bebe?

574
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:17,147
- Jesus.
(DOG BARKING)

575
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:19,983
I'll call Holly
and have her oversee the catering.

576
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:21,943
I promise, we can figure this out.

577
00:23:22,027 --> 00:23:24,821
This weekend should be about you and Missy,

578
00:23:24,905 --> 00:23:25,947
and your happiness.

579
00:23:26,031 --> 00:23:28,950
And if my presence
means that that doesn't happen...

580
00:23:29,034 --> 00:23:31,286
But, Bebe, you're a big
part of that happiness.

581
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:32,369
I'll just...

582
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:33,997
No. Because then every time

583
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,874
you look back on your wedding day,

584
00:23:35,957 --> 00:23:37,374
it's gonna be with pain and regret.

585
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:38,696
And I can't allow that to happen.

586
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:41,796
(SIGHS) I love you, sweetie.

587
00:23:42,923 --> 00:23:43,924
Oh.

588
00:23:44,007 --> 00:23:47,677
Ciao, baby. Just consider this
my wedding present, okay?

589
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:51,264
Oh, God, help your father
before he blows his bypass.

590
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:53,308
Pop, I got it.

BEBE: That's it.

593
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:02,400
There. You be brave, and elegant.

594
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:06,071
Okay? Don't take shit
from any of the old people.

595
00:24:06,738 --> 00:24:08,740
Bebe. Bebe!

596
00:24:09,074 --> 00:24:10,407
Please, you don't have to do this.

597
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:11,408
Oh, pishposh.

598
00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:14,746
I'm gonna go to The Plaza,
use Donald's platinum card.

599
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:17,123
Listen. Look, I need you this weekend.

600
00:24:17,207 --> 00:24:19,209
I can't get through this without you.
I can't...

601
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:21,878
Back off, Donald. You're
already on thin ice.

602
00:24:21,962 --> 00:24:23,254
What the hell did I do?

603
00:24:24,673 --> 00:24:26,257
It's not what you did.

604
00:24:26,341 --> 00:24:28,425
Okay. Okay, what didn't I do?

605
00:24:28,426 --> 00:24:30,053
Why don't you ask your wife?

606
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:31,376
Maybe she'll explain it to you.

607
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:32,806
(ENGINE STARTING)
- Bebe.

608
00:24:32,889 --> 00:24:34,349
DON: - My fault.
- Yep.

609
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:37,435
My fault! Un-fucking-believable.

610
00:24:38,853 --> 00:24:41,648
Piece of wedding advice, kid,
stay single as long as you can.

611
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,900
- Will do.
- Trust me.

612
00:24:44,275 --> 00:24:46,444
As long as you possibly can.

613
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:48,445
ELLIE: Hey, I'm sorry,
but may I just say something here?

614
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:50,448
The woman that you
supposedly love is devastated,

615
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,826
and all you've got, Don, is "stay single."

616
00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:53,994
it was a joke.

617
00:24:54,077 --> 00:24:56,453
Right, I forgot,
you haven't laughed since the '60s.

618
00:24:56,454 --> 00:24:57,831
Yeah. Not since I married you.

619
00:24:57,914 --> 00:24:59,749
Yeah, well, promise to never do that again.

620
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:01,458
Oh, believe me, not in a million years.

621
00:25:01,459 --> 00:25:03,086
Well, but let's not bring
your mother into this.

622
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:04,212
Um, guys.

623
00:25:05,213 --> 00:25:06,464
- Ki-yai!

624
00:25:07,924 --> 00:25:09,759
You just punched me in the face!
What are you doing?

625
00:25:09,843 --> 00:25:11,469
I could tell you something,
I earned my green belt,

626
00:25:11,511 --> 00:25:14,180
and you talk shit
about my mother again, I swear, Don...

627
00:25:14,264 --> 00:25:15,348
- Guys!
ELLIE: - What?

628
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:18,027
I thought she wasn't coming until tomorrow.

629
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:19,227
That was yesterday. For God's sake.

I'm sorry. Here we go, dear.

633
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:26,693
What are you doing?

634
00:25:26,776 --> 00:25:27,819
What do you mean, what am I doing?

635
00:25:27,902 --> 00:25:29,612
I don't know. After what you just did?

636
00:25:29,696 --> 00:25:31,489
- You're gonna hold my hand.
- It's okay.

00:34:08,005 --> 00:34:10,174
Father, I would like you
to meet my biological mother.

808
00:34:10,633 --> 00:34:11,634
Madonna Soto.

809
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:13,636
It's a great privilege to meet you, madam.

810
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,304
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

811
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:18,766
MOINIGHAN: Your mother's
a little old school.

812
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:20,369
I'm sorry, but my Latin's a bit rusty.

813
00:34:20,434 --> 00:34:22,019
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

814
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:26,915
My mother would like to give confession.

815
00:34:27,024 --> 00:34:28,234
Right.

816
00:34:31,195 --> 00:34:33,614
My mother would
like all of us to give confession.

817
00:34:33,698 --> 00:34:35,031
- Nope. Sod off. Screw that.
- Like hell I will.

818
00:34:35,032 --> 00:34:36,033
Guess what? No.

819
00:34:36,534 --> 00:34:38,578
Forgive me, Father, for this is bullshit.

820
00:34:38,661 --> 00:34:42,038
Don, it's a lovely gesture
to make to your guest.

821
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:43,791
How's sobriety working for you?

822
00:34:43,874 --> 00:34:45,668
Sucks a dick. You know that. Shit.

823
00:34:46,294 --> 00:34:48,879
It's wonderful to see you
and Donny together again.

824
00:34:48,963 --> 00:34:52,008
Oh, yeah. We got "remarried" this morning.

825
00:34:52,049 --> 00:34:53,050
You're kidding.

826
00:34:53,509 --> 00:34:55,553
- Can you keep a secret?
- It's confession.

827
00:34:55,636 --> 00:34:57,013
(CHUCKLES)

828
00:34:57,054 --> 00:34:58,681
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

829
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,103
MOINIGHAN: I thought
you were against organized religion.

830
00:35:04,186 --> 00:35:06,062
Well, after this weekend,
I may need all the help I can get.

831
00:35:06,063 --> 00:35:07,231
Go on, my son.

832
00:35:07,315 --> 00:35:09,984
Is it wrong to lie to someone you love

833
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:12,903
if the only reason that you're deceiving
them is to protect their happiness?

834
00:35:12,987 --> 00:35:14,071
Well, that depends.

835
00:35:14,155 --> 00:35:17,867
Are you disrupting the lives of anyone else
by enacting your deception?

836
00:35:21,329 --> 00:35:23,497
(CONTINUES SPEAKING SPANISH)

837
00:35:27,001 --> 00:35:29,587
What's a ring gonna prove after eight
years of love and companionship?

838
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,831
I mean, she's my girl.
What else does she want from me?

839
00:35:31,881 --> 00:35:33,841
Oscar Wilde once said that marriage

840
00:35:33,924 --> 00:35:36,092
is a triumph of imagination
over intelligence.

841
00:35:36,093 --> 00:35:37,595
Oscar Wilde?

842
00:35:37,678 --> 00:35:40,264
Oscar Wilde used
to make whoopsie with altar boys.

843
00:35:40,348 --> 00:35:43,099
That's true. Forget what I just said.

844
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,186
This place, I miss it.

845
00:35:45,269 --> 00:35:46,771
- Mmm.
- It's like...

846
00:35:47,647 --> 00:35:48,648
It's like home.

847
00:35:48,731 --> 00:35:51,442
Even he's like home.
Even Don is like home to me.

848
00:35:51,525 --> 00:35:52,818
It's so strange.

849
00:35:52,902 --> 00:35:53,944
Does that frighten you?

850
00:35:54,028 --> 00:35:56,822
Well, I mean, obviously,
that part of my life is over,

851
00:35:56,906 --> 00:36:00,451
and I do think that that's a good thing.

852
00:36:00,534 --> 00:36:02,119
Well, there's different kinds of love.

853
00:36:02,787 --> 00:36:04,080
- There are?
- Yeah.

854
00:36:04,121 --> 00:36:05,331
You know, just because you're divorced

855
00:36:05,414 --> 00:36:08,125
doesn't mean
you're legally required to hate him.

856
00:36:09,126 --> 00:36:11,962
You know, you're not as dumb
as Don says you are.

857
00:36:12,046 --> 00:36:13,129
Thank you.

858
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:14,131
I'm outta here.

859
00:36:14,924 --> 00:36:16,926
- Nice chatting with you.
- Bullshit.

860
00:36:23,891 --> 00:36:27,143
Griffin, table for 50.

861
00:36:27,144 --> 00:36:29,772
Uh, actually, the O'Connors requested

862
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:32,942
a private table on the Rose Terrace.

863
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,151
Outside?

864
00:36:34,902 --> 00:36:36,570
Isn't it supposed to rain?

865
00:36:36,654 --> 00:36:39,281
That was communicated to them, yes.

866
00:36:40,324 --> 00:36:42,158
Uh, right this way.

867
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:43,828
(THUNDER CRASHING)

868
00:36:44,412 --> 00:36:46,162
Barry, what's with the alfresco?

869
00:36:46,163 --> 00:36:48,004
- It's gonna piss all over us.
- No, it's fine.

870
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,166
We just thought it would be more private.

871
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:50,251
She insisted.

872
00:36:50,334 --> 00:36:52,378
The thought that anyone
would see us eating with a bunch of,

873
00:36:52,461 --> 00:36:53,713
what was the expression you used, Mom?

874
00:36:53,796 --> 00:36:57,383
Uh, Barry O'Connor.
It's very, very nice to meet you.

875
00:36:57,466 --> 00:37:01,262
Nice to meet you. This is my wife, Muffin.

876
00:37:01,345 --> 00:37:03,556
We're delighted to make your acquaintance.

877
00:37:03,764 --> 00:37:06,684
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

878
00:37:06,767 --> 00:37:08,686
And of course our daughter, Melissa.

879
00:37:08,769 --> 00:37:09,979
Hi.

880
00:37:10,938 --> 00:37:13,190
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

881
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:26,203
Mama?

882
00:37:26,746 --> 00:37:27,830
It's okay.

883
00:37:28,789 --> 00:37:31,834
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

884
00:37:52,229 --> 00:37:54,023
What the fuck did she just say?

885
00:37:54,106 --> 00:37:55,232
Shh! Please.

886
00:37:56,108 --> 00:37:57,860
DON: I don't know what she's saying.

887
00:37:59,653 --> 00:38:00,654
(WHISPERING)

888
00:38:06,243 --> 00:38:08,204
You have my blessing.

889
00:38:08,245 --> 00:38:10,164
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

890
00:38:10,331 --> 00:38:11,999
BARRY: All right.

891
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:15,336
- Come sit.
BARRY: - Yeah.

892
00:38:15,419 --> 00:38:17,755
You know, contemplate, place to put it.

893
00:38:21,258 --> 00:38:22,885
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

894
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,261
Hey, Don. Where's Bebe?

895
00:38:25,262 --> 00:38:28,224
We were supposed to
go over the crudités presentation together.

896
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:30,100
Yeah. Well, her aunt just passed,

897
00:38:30,184 --> 00:38:31,704
so she had to go back to Poughkeepsie.

898
00:38:32,269 --> 00:38:33,270
MADONNA: Nuria!

899
00:38:33,521 --> 00:38:35,481
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

900
00:38:35,564 --> 00:38:37,691
- But her aunt's dead.
- That's what I said.

901
00:38:53,082 --> 00:38:54,667
God knows I hate a boring dinner.

902
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,126
Everybody have enough ice water?

903
00:38:56,335 --> 00:38:59,839
Good evening, and welcome
to Weeblewog Country Club.

904
00:38:59,922 --> 00:39:01,298
My name is Yvette.

905
00:39:02,174 --> 00:39:04,927
And I will be your captain this evening.

906
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:06,302
Bebe?

907
00:39:06,303 --> 00:39:07,304
(THUMPING)
- Ow!

908
00:39:07,388 --> 00:39:10,099
BEBE: Tonight our soup is a lobster bisque,

909
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:12,309
flavored with twice
the recommended daily dose of sodium.

910
00:39:12,393 --> 00:39:14,895
We also have a filet mignon.

911
00:39:14,979 --> 00:39:18,983
Not organic, stuffed with
bleu cheese, sour cream,

912
00:39:19,066 --> 00:39:20,609
bacon, and a defibrillator.

913
00:39:20,693 --> 00:39:22,319
DON: I'll have the filet mignon.

914
00:39:22,528 --> 00:39:23,863
Don't think so.

915
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:25,656
Excuse me, miss.

916
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:28,242
Our guests really aren't
used to American food.

917
00:39:28,325 --> 00:39:30,326
Do you think that Chef Claude

918
00:39:30,327 --> 00:39:33,956
could whip up some chimichangi thingy?

919
00:39:34,081 --> 00:39:35,332
No. Stop it.

920
00:39:35,583 --> 00:39:36,750
MUFFIN: What, I didn't say it right?

921
00:39:36,834 --> 00:39:38,711
No, you said it fine.

922
00:39:39,128 --> 00:39:40,212
Just fine.

923
00:39:40,462 --> 00:39:41,547
Are you okay?

924
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:44,300
(SOFTLY) Just fucking with him.

925
00:39:45,009 --> 00:39:46,302
BARRY: Fine.

926
00:39:46,343 --> 00:39:47,344
Mama.

927
00:39:48,137 --> 00:39:49,346
What's the rumpus?

928
00:39:49,972 --> 00:39:51,724
Oh, um, she was wondering why the wedding

929
00:39:51,807 --> 00:39:53,349
is being held at our house,

930
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:55,561
and not at the O'Connors'.

931
00:39:56,687 --> 00:39:57,688
Um...

932
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:02,568
Well, we thought we'd shake it up a little.

933
00:40:02,902 --> 00:40:04,570
Uh, besides, our house...

934
00:40:04,653 --> 00:40:06,280
- Is in foreclosure?

935
00:40:06,363 --> 00:40:07,531
- Okay, that's...
MISSY: - That's right.

936
00:40:07,615 --> 00:40:09,366
He has to plead poverty

937
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:13,203
because he's
being investigated for stock fraud.

938
00:40:13,287 --> 00:40:14,370
Spectacular fork.

939
00:40:14,371 --> 00:40:16,081
BARRY: It's more complicated
than that, I think.

940
00:40:16,165 --> 00:40:18,125
But we still have money. We do.

941
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:19,877
- Really. It's just...
- Okay.

942
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,962
It's overseas for the time being.

943
00:40:22,046 --> 00:40:23,213
BARRY: That's enough!

944
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,842
I'm gonna check on the soup.

945
00:40:28,385 --> 00:40:31,347
I wanted to tell you
that your house is the most

946
00:40:31,388 --> 00:40:33,389
amazing place that I have ever seen.

947
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:34,808
You built it yourselves, yes?

948
00:40:34,892 --> 00:40:36,143
(THUDDING)

949
00:40:36,393 --> 00:40:37,436
We did, actually.

950
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:38,812
Tell her the story.

951
00:40:39,188 --> 00:40:40,549
MISSY: Yeah, it's really romantic.

952
00:40:40,856 --> 00:40:42,983
It is. It is romantic.

953
00:40:43,067 --> 00:40:45,401
It's fine. Tell her. Tell the story.

954
00:40:45,402 --> 00:40:48,405
Don and I, we were living
in the city separately.

955
00:40:48,864 --> 00:40:50,282
She wouldn't shack up with me

956
00:40:50,366 --> 00:40:51,646
because we weren't in matrimony.

957
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,744
ELLIE: So Don's latest exhibition

958
00:40:53,827 --> 00:40:55,120
had sold out completely.

959
00:40:55,204 --> 00:40:56,412
Third in a row.

960
00:40:56,413 --> 00:40:58,499
It did well. Awash in humility. As always.

961
00:40:58,582 --> 00:40:59,833
One of the many things she loves about me.

962
00:40:59,917 --> 00:41:00,918
That's our Donny. Yes.

963
00:41:01,001 --> 00:41:03,379
Can we please just skip
to the happy ending?

964
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,420
(SPITS)

965
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:05,422
ELLIE: So Don and I,

966
00:41:05,464 --> 00:41:07,383
we decided we'd take a
drive to the country,

967
00:41:07,424 --> 00:41:09,510
and we came to this open field. Remember?

968
00:41:09,593 --> 00:41:11,053
We parked there, we went for a walk.

969
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:12,805
And it was so wonderful.

970
00:41:12,888 --> 00:41:13,931
It was sunset.

971
00:41:14,014 --> 00:41:16,016
Do you remember that, Don? Sweet.

972
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:19,269
And we came across this gorgeous pond.

973
00:41:20,062 --> 00:41:23,983
And he proposed to me
as the sun kind of went down.

974
00:41:24,066 --> 00:41:27,361
DON: I was...
I was sneaking out here on Saturday

975
00:41:27,444 --> 00:41:28,821
while she was
spending time with her folks, and...

976
00:41:28,904 --> 00:41:30,446
Yeah, but I knew what you were up to.

977
00:41:30,447 --> 00:41:31,532
Believe me, I knew what he was up to.

978
00:41:31,615 --> 00:41:32,783
- Oh, you?
- I did.

979
00:41:32,866 --> 00:41:33,993
You didn't have a clue.

980
00:41:34,076 --> 00:41:35,619
- What are you talking about?
- You were clueless.

981
00:41:35,703 --> 00:41:36,704
He spent three months

982
00:41:36,787 --> 00:41:38,163
searching the entire New
England countryside

983
00:41:38,247 --> 00:41:39,455
for the most beautiful spot,

984
00:41:39,456 --> 00:41:41,257
and when he found it,
he took her back there.

985
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:42,459
And then when he proposed...

986
00:41:43,002 --> 00:41:44,003
He planted...

987
00:41:44,086 --> 00:41:45,671
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

988
00:41:49,633 --> 00:41:50,843
And then they built a house over the years

989
00:41:50,926 --> 00:41:53,469
under the shade of the
tree, and added on to it

990
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:57,725
every time Don
sold another sculpture, until, well...

991
00:41:57,808 --> 00:41:59,852
(MADONNA SPEAKING SPANISH)

992
00:42:01,186 --> 00:42:03,814
You are very lucky to find a man like that.

993
00:42:04,231 --> 00:42:05,482
Oh, yes, of course.

994
00:42:05,524 --> 00:42:07,317
I'm just... I'm terribly lucky.

995
00:42:07,401 --> 00:42:09,236
Thank you. Thank you.

996
00:42:09,945 --> 00:42:11,363
ELLIE: Uh, Yvette?

997
00:42:11,822 --> 00:42:14,199
Will you please excuse me, just for...

998
00:42:15,743 --> 00:42:17,077
- Jared!
(CUTLERY CLATTERS)

999
00:42:17,161 --> 00:42:18,494
May I please speak with you?

1000
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:19,496
Yeah, sure.

1001
00:42:20,122 --> 00:42:22,374
You know what? I got...
Give me, like, one sec.

1002
00:42:22,458 --> 00:42:24,460
I got, like, a terrible leg cramp.

1003
00:42:24,501 --> 00:42:26,253
ELLIE: Uh-huh. Nuria, dear. Please. Yes.

1004
00:42:26,336 --> 00:42:27,503
Please. May I take you to the restroom,

1005
00:42:27,504 --> 00:42:28,547
please, the ladies' room?

1006
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:30,549
Where we can wash your beautiful hands.

1007
00:42:31,258 --> 00:42:32,968
BARRY: Well, (CLEARS THROAT)

1008
00:42:34,386 --> 00:42:36,930
here's to a wonderful dinner.

1009
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:40,809
And a really

1010
00:42:40,893 --> 00:42:41,894
- neat wedding.
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

1011
00:42:41,977 --> 00:42:43,520
- Huh? Okay.
- Indeed.

1012
00:42:44,438 --> 00:42:45,481
ALEJANDRO: Cheers.

1013
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,403
(SPLASHING)

1014
00:42:56,158 --> 00:42:57,409
BARRY: Madonna,

1015
00:42:57,493 --> 00:42:59,536
how is your bisque?

1016
00:43:00,329 --> 00:43:01,413
Huh?

1017
00:43:05,834 --> 00:43:07,503
(RAIN POURING)

1018
00:43:08,545 --> 00:43:10,547
Oh, for Pete's sake.

1019
00:43:18,055 --> 00:43:19,264
Oh, my God.

1020
00:43:19,348 --> 00:43:21,058
So, the thing to remember
is that men are like pumpkins,

1021
00:43:21,141 --> 00:43:22,351
the good ones are either taken

1022
00:43:22,434 --> 00:43:23,477
or they've had everything scraped

1023
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,560
out of their heads with a spoon.

1024
00:43:24,561 --> 00:43:26,562
MUFFIN: I'm melting! Oh, my God!

1025
00:43:26,563 --> 00:43:27,731
- My face!
- What's happened?

1026
00:43:27,815 --> 00:43:29,942
What's happening in here?

1027
00:43:30,025 --> 00:43:32,945
Well, Nuria and I
have become very close friends.

1028
00:43:33,028 --> 00:43:35,572
Yes. She was just explaining to me.

1029
00:43:36,448 --> 00:43:37,699
- Really?
BOTH: - Mmm-hmm.

1030
00:43:41,662 --> 00:43:43,038
Wish I had been adopted.

1031
00:43:43,705 --> 00:43:45,332
Can we please just elope now?

1032
00:43:45,582 --> 00:43:47,876
Seems like the lesser
of two evils at this point.

1033
00:43:48,335 --> 00:43:50,712
Really? Because I'm pretty sure
Vegas is just back that way.

1034
00:43:50,796 --> 00:43:52,796
I'm pretty sure that you
wouldn't survive the trip.

1035
00:43:53,006 --> 00:43:55,467
- What the hell is going on with your family?
- Why?

1036
00:43:57,970 --> 00:43:59,096
Oh.

1037
00:43:59,179 --> 00:44:03,142
My kingdom, my kingdom,
my kingdom for a steakhouse.

1038
00:44:03,225 --> 00:44:04,393
(CHUCKLES)

1039
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:06,353
DON: What a bust that was.

1040
00:44:08,105 --> 00:44:09,606
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

1041
00:44:12,025 --> 00:44:13,152
What are you grinning at?

1042
00:44:13,235 --> 00:44:15,863
(GIGGLES) Oh, it's just women's lib.

1043
00:44:16,613 --> 00:44:18,614
You know something, I'm cold.

1044
00:44:18,615 --> 00:44:20,117
Are you sure that heat's all the way up?

1045
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,619
Well, yeah. We'll take a steam
when we get back to the house.

1046
00:44:22,703 --> 00:44:24,496
Wait a minute,
you have a steam in the guest room?

1047
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:25,747
Nope. The master bedroom.

1048
00:44:26,123 --> 00:44:27,624
(LAUGHS MOCKINGLY)

1049
00:44:27,666 --> 00:44:28,667
Whatever you say.

AUTOMATED VOICE: <i>You have no new messages in your mailbox.</i>

1051
00:44:30,627 --> 00:44:32,796
Ridiculous. It's like I ceased to exist.

1052
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,464
What's that, Lyla?

1053
00:44:34,548 --> 00:44:37,009
No texts, no calls. Nothing.

1054
00:44:38,635 --> 00:44:39,636
<i>Hombres.</i>

1055
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:40,846
I know, right?

1056
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:42,638
ELLIE: No offense, Lyla, but honestly.

1057
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:44,516
Really, you did leave him.

1058
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,643
Yeah, he doesn't have
to make it so easy for me.

1059
00:44:47,936 --> 00:44:49,396
You think he'll show up at the wedding?

1060
00:44:49,479 --> 00:44:50,772
He does, I'll tell him
to fuck the fuck off.

1061
00:44:50,856 --> 00:44:52,399
- Language.
ELLIE: - Oh, Lyla.

1062
00:44:52,482 --> 00:44:54,568
He said terrible things to me.

1063
00:44:54,651 --> 00:44:56,695
- Punch him in the nose?
- Of course not.

1064
00:44:56,778 --> 00:44:58,572
Because that would be unladylike.

1065
00:44:59,281 --> 00:45:00,866
What are you looking at me for?

1066
00:45:03,911 --> 00:45:04,953
You miss him.

1067
00:45:07,414 --> 00:45:08,582
A little.

1068
00:45:08,665 --> 00:45:11,335
That's what I thought.
Look, just give him a call.

1069
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,128
I can't.

1070
00:45:32,522 --> 00:45:34,733
So, I was thinking
we could maybe go to my room,

1071
00:45:34,816 --> 00:45:37,778
listen to some music, or you know...

1072
00:45:38,695 --> 00:45:39,696
Whatever.

1073
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:41,573
No, thank you.

1074
00:45:41,823 --> 00:45:44,701
But you may read me
some poetry, if you wish.

1075
00:45:45,661 --> 00:45:46,662
Poetry?

1076
00:45:46,912 --> 00:45:47,913
Yes.

1077
00:45:48,705 --> 00:45:49,705
Are you serious?

1078
00:45:49,706 --> 00:45:51,833
Yes. Your mother was very informative.

1079
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:54,711
I deserve to be treated with respect.

1080
00:45:58,215 --> 00:45:59,633
Don't we all.

1081
00:45:59,716 --> 00:46:00,716
MISSY: Say it louder.

1082
00:46:00,717 --> 00:46:02,237
ALEJANDRO: I'm an idiot.
MISSY: A what?

1083
00:46:02,261 --> 00:46:06,431
I'm a galactic idiot.
My idiocracy knows no bounds.

1084
00:46:06,515 --> 00:46:10,310
You won't tell a tiny white lie to a priest
that you'll never see again,

1085
00:46:10,394 --> 00:46:12,562
but make a complete farce of our wedding?

1086
00:46:12,646 --> 00:46:13,729
- I know.
- That's no problem?

1087
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:14,731
I know.

1088
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,234
I feel so bad for Bebe.

1089
00:46:17,317 --> 00:46:19,903
You know how many months she and my
mom have been planning this.

1090
00:46:19,987 --> 00:46:23,407
I know. I know. I'm an idiot.

1091
00:46:28,287 --> 00:46:30,914
I did talk with Father Moinighan, though.

1092
00:46:31,331 --> 00:46:32,666
For reals?

1093
00:46:32,749 --> 00:46:34,751
I promised that little

1094
00:46:34,793 --> 00:46:36,878
Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John

1095
00:46:36,962 --> 00:46:40,257
would grow up ravenous
for the sweet baby Jesus.

1096
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:41,341
Did you?

1097
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:44,094
May have had crossies when I said it.

1098
00:46:46,221 --> 00:46:47,556
Thank you.

1099
00:46:48,098 --> 00:46:50,726
You really truly love me.

1100
00:46:50,767 --> 00:46:51,768
I do.

1101
00:46:52,894 --> 00:46:54,396
Yeah, you do.

1102
00:46:58,608 --> 00:47:00,277
And you'll fix all the other stuff?

1103
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,778
What's it worth to you?

1104
00:47:02,529 --> 00:47:03,572
Huh?

1105
00:47:03,655 --> 00:47:05,115
You honestly think...

1106
00:47:11,538 --> 00:47:14,791
It's too bad I'm saving
myself for marriage.

1107
00:47:15,334 --> 00:47:16,752
I'll see you tomorrow.

1108
00:47:17,794 --> 00:47:19,796
I'm busy tomorrow.

1109
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:22,799
MISSY: All I hear is, "Blah, blah, blah."

1110
00:47:23,884 --> 00:47:25,886
ELLIE: So, you know, call her again.

1111
00:47:25,969 --> 00:47:29,348
I tried, but she had the
front desk lock me out.

1112
00:47:32,017 --> 00:47:33,769
Tell me again how this is my fault.

1113
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:34,810
Don.

1114
00:47:34,811 --> 00:47:36,931
WOMAN: (ON TV)
<i>...in a year. Many of these children...</i>

1115
00:47:36,938 --> 00:47:38,299
DON: Now, where'd you dig that up?

1116
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,400
Oh, my God, I can't
believe how tiny he was.

1117
00:47:40,484 --> 00:47:41,485
Yeah.

1118
00:47:42,152 --> 00:47:43,487
Sometimes I wonder

1119
00:47:43,945 --> 00:47:45,155
if we did the right thing.

1120
00:47:45,322 --> 00:47:47,115
Ellie, for two people
who did a lot of things wrong,

1121
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:48,742
adopting AI wasn't one of them.

1122
00:47:48,825 --> 00:47:50,702
Yeah, he's the kindest of us all.

1123
00:47:50,786 --> 00:47:51,787
Yeah.

1124
00:47:51,828 --> 00:47:54,623
We didn't do that
many things that were wrong, did we?

1125
00:47:55,582 --> 00:47:57,042
Everybody's happy now.

1126
00:47:57,125 --> 00:47:58,293
- Well...
- Right?

1127
00:47:58,377 --> 00:47:59,753
(STAMMERS) Yeah, right.

1128
00:47:59,836 --> 00:48:02,297
Kids are great.
You're having nine-hour orgasms.

1129
00:48:02,381 --> 00:48:03,965
Uh... (LAUGHS)

1130
00:48:04,049 --> 00:48:05,850
No, no, no, just... Yeah,
well, give or take.

1131
00:48:06,843 --> 00:48:08,845
- I'm intrigued.
- Yeah, I'm stunned.

1132
00:48:08,929 --> 00:48:10,846
- Prove it.
- You wish.

1133
00:48:10,847 --> 00:48:12,849
- For old time's sake.
- Oh, my God. Okay.

1134
00:48:13,141 --> 00:48:15,602
You know what,
I think the coast must be clear by now.

1135
00:48:15,685 --> 00:48:16,770
Ooh.

1136
00:48:17,854 --> 00:48:18,855
Good to see you, Ell.

1137
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,983
I think you said that already.

1138
00:48:25,862 --> 00:48:26,947
- What the hell?
- Oh!

1139
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:28,824
- Ow!
- What are you doing?

1140
00:48:28,865 --> 00:48:29,866
Oh!

1141
00:48:30,867 --> 00:48:33,495
Shoot. You're gonna
wake Madonna, for God's sake.

1142
00:48:33,578 --> 00:48:34,579
Shh.

1143
00:48:34,871 --> 00:48:35,871
Ow!

1144
00:48:35,872 --> 00:48:38,667
I have been reading sonnets. Out loud.

1145
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:39,876
Well, that's very romantic.

1146
00:48:39,918 --> 00:48:41,878
So romantic for you, dear. What?

1147
00:48:42,879 --> 00:48:46,007
I am 29 years old, and
I've finally, I mean, I...

1148
00:48:46,383 --> 00:48:47,384
What?

1149
00:48:47,884 --> 00:48:49,885
I can't believe
I'm getting cock-blocked by my own mother.

1150
00:48:49,886 --> 00:48:52,013
I merely told her that
there are certain things

1151
00:48:52,097 --> 00:48:53,889
that women should expect from a man

1152
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:56,560
before she just
jumps into bed with him. All right?

1153
00:48:57,227 --> 00:49:00,772
Yeah, I know.
Don't you think it's kind of hard to...

1154
00:49:00,856 --> 00:49:01,857
What?

1155
00:49:01,898 --> 00:49:03,378
Send her flowers every day for a year

1156
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,040
when she goes back to Colombia on Monday.

1157
00:49:05,068 --> 00:49:06,069
<i>C'est la guerre.</i>

1158
00:49:07,028 --> 00:49:08,780
(GASPS) Oh...

1159
00:49:08,864 --> 00:49:09,906
So sorry.

1160
00:49:10,323 --> 00:49:11,907
Oh, my goodness.
Well, anyway, good night, sweetheart.

1161
00:49:11,908 --> 00:49:13,076
Sweet dreams, of course.

1162
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:14,161
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1163
00:49:14,244 --> 00:49:15,911
You suck. <i>Buenas noches.</i>

1164
00:49:15,912 --> 00:49:17,747
ELLIE: <i>Buenas noches.</i>

1165
00:49:22,794 --> 00:49:24,087
(GASPS) Oh!

1166
00:49:25,255 --> 00:49:26,715
<i>Noches.</i>

1167
00:49:26,965 --> 00:49:28,133
<i>Noches</i> again.

1168
00:49:29,926 --> 00:49:31,511
(EXHALING)

1169
00:49:31,803 --> 00:49:34,055
Oh! Back so soon?

1170
00:49:34,139 --> 00:49:37,225
Oh, yeah.
The temptation was more than I could stand.

1171
00:49:37,309 --> 00:49:38,934
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

1172
00:49:38,935 --> 00:49:40,312
Now you're talking.

1173
00:49:41,354 --> 00:49:43,064
- Uh...
- Be gentle.

1174
00:49:43,148 --> 00:49:45,066
(CHUCKLES)
- Or don't.

1175
00:49:47,152 --> 00:49:48,361
Good night.

1176
00:49:49,154 --> 00:49:51,573
- Good night? Says you.
- Yup.

1177
00:49:51,656 --> 00:49:53,158
Oh, please. Come on, you
didn't really think

1178
00:49:53,241 --> 00:49:55,243
that we'd go through with this, did you?

1179
00:49:55,327 --> 00:49:56,828
No one ever died from dabbling.

1180
00:49:56,912 --> 00:49:59,164
Uh-huh. Just our marriage.

1181
00:49:59,247 --> 00:50:00,956
- Fair point.
- Yeah.

1182
00:50:00,957 --> 00:50:03,293
But, you know,
I couldn't stand being ignored.

1183
00:50:04,419 --> 00:50:05,879
I ignored you?

1184
00:50:05,962 --> 00:50:09,508
You didn't need a soothsayer to know that
you were terrified of being alone with me.

1185
00:50:09,591 --> 00:50:11,927
I'm sorry, Don. Really, lam.

1186
00:50:11,968 --> 00:50:14,095
Just, you know, with the children gone,

1187
00:50:14,971 --> 00:50:17,474
I guess I didn't think
we had much in common anymore.

1188
00:50:17,557 --> 00:50:20,060
Yeah, so we picked up another kid
to avoid the issue.

1189
00:50:21,978 --> 00:50:24,564
You know, I tried to stick it out.
I really did.

1190
00:50:24,648 --> 00:50:25,982
I know you did, Don.

1191
00:50:29,027 --> 00:50:30,195
Wanna fool around?

1192
00:50:30,278 --> 00:50:31,821
(LAUGHS) Oh!

1193
00:50:33,114 --> 00:50:35,450
You need to marry Bebe.

1194
00:50:35,534 --> 00:50:37,869
And that's nothing you don't already know.

1195
00:50:38,578 --> 00:50:40,996
And what about you?
Anybody special since...

1196
00:50:40,997 --> 00:50:41,997
Me?

1197
00:50:41,998 --> 00:50:42,998
Yeah, of course.

1198
00:50:42,999 --> 00:50:44,167
There have been guys here and there.

1199
00:50:44,251 --> 00:50:47,504
Yeah. And I guess nothing
I'd write home about,

1200
00:50:47,587 --> 00:50:48,964
nothing special.

1201
00:50:49,297 --> 00:50:51,258
Well, I did date this local cop

1202
00:50:51,341 --> 00:50:52,384
when I lived over on Courtesy.

1203
00:50:52,467 --> 00:50:54,261
He was really quite nice.

1204
00:50:54,803 --> 00:50:57,055
And then in New York City
I met this stock broker

1205
00:50:57,138 --> 00:50:59,349
who actually proposed to me
on the third date.

1206
00:50:59,432 --> 00:51:02,352
You know, that should have
been my first clue. God.

1207
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:04,563
But then...

1208
00:51:05,522 --> 00:51:07,065
(SNORING)
(GROANS)

1209
00:51:20,287 --> 00:51:22,037
(RHYTHMIC THUDDING)

1210
00:51:22,038 --> 00:51:24,583
ELLIE: A little more left. Left. Oh!

1211
00:51:24,666 --> 00:51:26,041
- Oh, yeah!
(DON GROANING)

1212
00:51:26,042 --> 00:51:28,253
ELLIE: In there! That's right!
DON: Right there?

1213
00:51:28,336 --> 00:51:30,088
(BOTH EXCLAIMING)

1214
00:51:30,171 --> 00:51:31,923
(BOTH SCREAMING)

1215
00:51:57,157 --> 00:51:58,783
What happened to you?

1216
00:51:59,075 --> 00:52:00,327
What time is it?

1217
00:52:01,036 --> 00:52:02,637
A little after 8:00. I thought you quit?

1218
00:52:02,871 --> 00:52:04,998
Thought I quit a lot of things. 8:00?

1219
00:52:06,207 --> 00:52:07,626
So that would make it, hey...

1220
00:52:09,044 --> 00:52:11,796
Forty minutes. Not bad for starters.

1221
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:15,300
Was that what that...

1222
00:52:16,092 --> 00:52:19,012
You didn't. Oh, tell me you didn't.

1223
00:52:19,095 --> 00:52:23,141
You and Mom for 40, that's... You scumbags.

1224
00:52:23,224 --> 00:52:24,476
Gross. What?

1225
00:52:25,477 --> 00:52:27,354
- What about Bebe?
- I know.

1226
00:52:28,104 --> 00:52:30,106
God, what is wrong with you?

1227
00:52:33,485 --> 00:52:35,110
Forward, ducklings.

1228
00:52:35,111 --> 00:52:36,529
(BARKING)

1229
00:52:38,114 --> 00:52:42,118
We are gonna cater the shit out of this
thing whether they like it or not.

1230
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:44,412
(HONKING)

1231
00:52:46,122 --> 00:52:49,668
I know you can't understand me,
but now that you're here,

1232
00:52:49,751 --> 00:52:53,797
I want you to know that I've always been
intimidated by you.

1233
00:52:54,589 --> 00:52:58,134
Even so, I never
tried to take your place with him,

1234
00:52:58,218 --> 00:53:03,056
but I always encouraged
the phone calls, and the visits.

1235
00:53:03,431 --> 00:53:05,767
And meeting you, oh, my God,

1236
00:53:06,101 --> 00:53:10,980
I see where so much
of what's good in him comes from.

1237
00:53:11,064 --> 00:53:13,148
And I just, I'm just so...

1238
00:53:13,149 --> 00:53:16,820
I'm just so happy you're here.

1239
00:53:17,404 --> 00:53:21,950
Uh, do you...
Uh, oh, um, do you understand me?

1240
00:53:22,534 --> 00:53:24,160
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

1241
00:53:41,177 --> 00:53:42,887
DON: You working on anything lately?

1242
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:45,765
Haven't touched a chisel in years.

1243
00:53:46,182 --> 00:53:48,183
Wow, shame. You have more talent

1244
00:53:48,184 --> 00:53:49,936
in your little finger
than I have in my whole body.

1245
00:53:50,019 --> 00:53:51,186
I'm a big girl now, Don.

1246
00:53:51,187 --> 00:53:52,187
You don't have to say that anymore.

1247
00:53:52,188 --> 00:53:53,690
It happens to be true.

1248
00:53:54,566 --> 00:53:55,817
Hair of the dog?

1249
00:53:56,651 --> 00:53:57,986
No.

1250
00:53:58,069 --> 00:54:00,697
You sure today's the day
you want to fall off the wagon?

1251
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:02,532
Coin flip at this point.

1252
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:10,039
Pass the riffler.

1253
00:54:10,373 --> 00:54:11,374
How is it

1254
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:14,169
that you can make something so beautiful

1255
00:54:14,210 --> 00:54:16,838
and yet be such a complete douchebag?

1256
00:54:17,213 --> 00:54:19,174
I'm a complicated serpent.

1257
00:54:19,215 --> 00:54:20,800
Or whatever the hell she said.

1258
00:54:20,884 --> 00:54:23,052
So is this what happens with men?

1259
00:54:23,136 --> 00:54:24,888
Just a grain of strife in the relationship

1260
00:54:24,971 --> 00:54:26,611
and suddenly you're knee-deep in your ex?

1261
00:54:26,931 --> 00:54:28,183
Grandpa?

1262
00:54:28,224 --> 00:54:29,225
Grandpa?

1263
00:54:30,226 --> 00:54:32,437
Sweetie, I may be on the back nine of life,

1264
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,189
but I just spent the last 40 minutes

1265
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:36,149
laying more pipe than I have in 20 years.

1266
00:54:36,232 --> 00:54:37,942
I didn't say no to the scotch

1267
00:54:38,026 --> 00:54:39,611
'cause I didn't want the drink.

1268
00:54:41,863 --> 00:54:43,239
So wait a second.

1269
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:46,618
You're...

1270
00:54:51,831 --> 00:54:53,166
Andrew doesn't know.

1271
00:54:55,668 --> 00:54:58,254
I'm not one of those women who thinks

1272
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:01,216
I deserve to have a child

1273
00:55:01,257 --> 00:55:04,093
just because my uterus
suddenly decides to work.

1274
00:55:05,053 --> 00:55:06,554
He either loves me or he doesn't.

1275
00:55:22,695 --> 00:55:25,198
(SIGHS) I'd hug you, but...

1276
00:55:25,365 --> 00:55:26,533
After last time...

1277
00:55:42,298 --> 00:55:44,884
I'll just try one of these.

1278
00:55:51,182 --> 00:55:52,307
- Delicious.
- Good.

1279
00:55:52,308 --> 00:55:53,685
Happy you're pleased, Mr. Griffin.

1280
00:55:53,768 --> 00:55:54,769
You are paying for it.

1281
00:55:54,853 --> 00:55:57,355
Mmm-hmm. Well, you know,
I think I'll have a few more.

1282
00:55:57,438 --> 00:55:58,439
No.

1283
00:55:59,148 --> 00:56:00,316
I don't think so.

1284
00:56:00,733 --> 00:56:03,278
You know, if I were talking to you,

1285
00:56:03,403 --> 00:56:05,071

Ellie. And, I mean, I think actually that's

1604
01:11:18,692 --> 01:11:20,152
probably one of the reasons

1605
01:11:20,235 --> 01:11:22,529
that I found Don so attractive.

1606
01:11:22,613 --> 01:11:25,407
Come on. You were in love with Don Griffin

1607
01:11:25,491 --> 01:11:27,367
from the first time I introduced you

1608
01:11:27,534 --> 01:11:28,744
at the Crabtree summer party.

1609
01:11:28,827 --> 01:11:30,245
Was it that obvious?

1610
01:11:30,329 --> 01:11:31,371
Yeah, to me.

1611
01:11:31,455 --> 01:11:33,540
Well, then why didn't
you hit me with your car or something?

1612
01:11:33,624 --> 01:11:36,251
Come on, you were my best friend.

1613
01:11:38,253 --> 01:11:39,922
Still are, I hope.

1614
01:11:41,173 --> 01:11:43,884
Oh, Bebe. It wasn't him.

1615
01:11:44,092 --> 01:11:46,386
Oh, yeah, okay, so he was flirting,

1616
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:47,930
but I made the first move.

1617
01:11:48,764 --> 01:11:50,808
- Why?
- Because...

1618
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:54,353
I wanted to make sure I was over him.

1619
01:11:54,436 --> 01:11:56,313
And you know what? it turns out

1620
01:11:56,396 --> 01:11:59,274
I've been over him for such a long time.

1621
01:12:01,276 --> 01:12:03,278
I want you to know something else.

1622
01:12:03,862 --> 01:12:05,697
I've always been happy

1623
01:12:06,281 --> 01:12:09,076
that it was you he turned to.

1624
01:12:11,662 --> 01:12:13,288
I told you I forgive you.

1625
01:12:13,330 --> 01:12:14,832
Then forgive him, too.

JARED: Oh, my God!

1628
01:12:23,298 --> 01:12:24,383
Oh, my God.

1629
01:12:25,342 --> 01:12:26,552
Again.

1630
01:12:26,927 --> 01:12:28,178
Oh, hell yeah.

1631
01:12:30,305 --> 01:12:31,305
Ah!

1632
01:12:31,306 --> 01:12:33,308
MAN: - Excuse me...
- No, thank you.

1633
01:12:36,895 --> 01:12:38,564
At least no one will ever forget it.

1634
01:12:38,772 --> 01:12:39,773
I'm an orphan.

1635
01:12:39,857 --> 01:12:41,400
No, no. It's not that bad.

1636
01:12:41,483 --> 01:12:45,320
My mother's a lesbian, and my father
has had his penis in your mom.

1637
01:12:45,988 --> 01:12:47,406
Ugh! That's a picture.

1638
01:12:47,698 --> 01:12:49,449
If it makes you feel any better,
I think my brother

1639
01:12:49,533 --> 01:12:50,993
is somewhere having sex with my sister.

1640
01:12:51,076 --> 01:12:52,077
What?

1641
01:12:52,661 --> 01:12:54,329
They are all coming out of the woodwork.

1642
01:13:00,335 --> 01:13:02,004
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

1643
01:13:03,338 --> 01:13:07,926
No. No, I'm just saying call me
if she gets back to the hotel.

1644
01:13:08,343 --> 01:13:11,763
Well, how the hell...
Listen, how am I supposed to know?

1645
01:13:11,847 --> 01:13:13,348
That's why I'm asking you.

1646
01:13:13,557 --> 01:13:14,600
Ow!

1647
01:13:15,392 --> 01:13:18,145
And that makes a full set.
What the hell did I do now?

1648
01:13:18,228 --> 01:13:20,354
Do you know why I've
stayed away from you for all these years?

1649
01:13:20,355 --> 01:13:22,399
I have some idea. But I... Okay.

1650
01:13:22,482 --> 01:13:25,485
Because like it or not, I'm your daughter.

1651
01:13:25,694 --> 01:13:26,904
Jared got all of Mom's traits,

1652
01:13:26,987 --> 01:13:28,906
and I won the lottery with all of yours.

1653
01:13:29,364 --> 01:13:31,365
Yeah. You know, if we're the same,

1654
01:13:31,366 --> 01:13:34,368
how come no one's
popping you in the face every five minutes?

1655
01:13:34,369 --> 01:13:35,370
Huh?

1656
01:13:36,371 --> 01:13:37,706
You know, when you cheated on Mom

1657
01:13:38,081 --> 01:13:41,001
I became terrified that I was gonna
ruin my marriage the same way.

1658
01:13:41,919 --> 01:13:43,253
And I don't want to be like that.

1659
01:13:43,337 --> 01:13:45,380
I don't want to be like you anymore.

1660
01:13:46,048 --> 01:13:48,300
- Andrew's here.
- Yeah, I know, Dad.

1661
01:13:48,634 --> 01:13:50,135
I wonder who called him?

1662
01:13:51,637 --> 01:13:52,638
Yeah, okay, two things.

1663
01:13:52,721 --> 01:13:55,349
Then if you never speak
to me again, so be it.

1664
01:13:56,183 --> 01:14:00,520
Look. I know you would figure out that
I called him.

1665
01:14:01,188 --> 01:14:02,981
And you're right, Lyla, we are alike.

1666
01:14:03,065 --> 01:14:05,399
Neither of us are particularly close
to being stupid.

1667
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:06,818
And you know what, you can hate me

1668
01:14:06,902 --> 01:14:08,695
for the rest of your life,
if that's what you need.

1669
01:14:08,779 --> 01:14:10,614
But I'm gonna tell you
what I need as your father.

1670
01:14:10,697 --> 01:14:12,157
I need as your father

1671
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:13,575
to be able to give my little girl

1672
01:14:13,659 --> 01:14:15,410
the best chance at a happy life.

1673
01:14:15,494 --> 01:14:19,413
Because ultimately, and we're all selfish,
that gives me the best chance at a happy life.

1674
01:14:19,414 --> 01:14:20,874
Even if you hate me for it.

1675
01:14:20,958 --> 01:14:22,358
- I don't hate you.
- Let me finish.

1676
01:14:22,417 --> 01:14:24,044
Let me finish.

1677
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:26,420
I know you love me,
sweetheart, even if you don't.

1678
01:14:26,421 --> 01:14:27,714
I do know that.

1679
01:14:27,798 --> 01:14:30,838
And I know that when Mom and I split up
you felt that you had to pick a side.

1680
01:14:30,842 --> 01:14:32,177
And I was okay with that.

1681
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:34,262
Because, you know,
she needed you more than I did.

1682
01:14:34,346 --> 01:14:35,555
And I understand that.

(SIGHS)

1684
01:14:39,768 --> 01:14:44,439
The day you were born,
I went out and I got blasted,

1685
01:14:45,190 --> 01:14:49,486
and I left your mom alone.
I just drank my face off.

1686
01:14:52,030 --> 01:14:54,448
You know, you had these
swollen little eyes,

1687
01:14:54,449 --> 01:14:56,451
and these pink little hands.

1688
01:15:00,455 --> 01:15:01,915
You were so...

1689
01:15:02,457 --> 01:15:05,627
I couldn't rectify how something

1690
01:15:08,005 --> 01:15:11,466
so incandescent could come
from an old douchebag like me.

1691
01:15:12,092 --> 01:15:13,093
Same with the boys.

1692
01:15:13,176 --> 01:15:15,017
You know, but for a few
mistakes along the way,

1693
01:15:15,053 --> 01:15:18,015
I did the best I could
to earn my place in all of your lives.

1694
01:15:19,224 --> 01:15:21,025
You know, you can
be mad at me, not mad at me.

1695
01:15:21,184 --> 01:15:24,104
It's never gonna change
how I feel about you.

1696
01:15:25,063 --> 01:15:27,983
And, look, I know these are
just words to you now.

1697
01:15:28,483 --> 01:15:29,818
But trust me, you'll understand what I mean

1698
01:15:29,901 --> 01:15:31,528
when your daughter is born.

1699
01:15:37,492 --> 01:15:39,202
How do you know it's a girl?

1700
01:15:40,746 --> 01:15:44,041
I don't. I'm just hoping
you'll be that lucky.

1701
01:16:01,099 --> 01:16:03,310
And I'm sorry that I'm so late, by the way.

1702
01:16:03,393 --> 01:16:05,228
I actually wasn't planning on coming.

1703
01:16:05,312 --> 01:16:06,313
You didn't miss much.

1704

Okay. He said that
you had something to tell me.

You never called me.

1717
01:16:37,552 --> 01:16:40,347
Well, you did say that
you never wanted to speak to me again.

Sorry.

Are you serious? I don't believe this.

Andrew, I won't bring this baby
into an unhappy marriage.

1728
01:17:13,588 --> 01:17:16,341
I agree. I agree. We can work on that.

1729
01:17:17,592 --> 01:17:18,802
Okay.

Well, okay. We're all listening.

it's that it's all but a dream.

01:18:12,939 --> 01:18:14,816
the only real use in loving someone

1752
01:18:15,650 --> 01:18:17,194
is that it makes your life better.

01:18:31,541 --> 01:18:34,419
No, no, I did not ask you a question.

1760
01:18:34,502 --> 01:18:35,670
The answer is yes.

1761
01:18:35,754 --> 01:18:38,215
I did not ask him a question.

1762
01:18:38,298 --> 01:18:42,469
Yes. Yes. Yes, I am a horse's ass.
Yes, I will ogle,

1763
01:18:42,552 --> 01:18:44,137
but never again, other
than perhaps mentally,

1764
01:18:44,221 --> 01:18:45,555
fondle another woman.

1765
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:47,681
And yes, I will embarrass you,

1766
01:18:47,682 --> 01:18:49,142
and shock you, and often cause you

1767
01:18:49,226 --> 01:18:50,685
to question every last reason in the world

1768
01:18:50,769 --> 01:18:52,570
why you would ever love
me in the first place.

1769
01:18:52,604 --> 01:18:53,688
- Yes.
- You...

1770
01:18:53,939 --> 01:18:56,566
- Yeah?
- Think that I still love you?

1771
01:18:57,525 --> 01:18:58,568
Really, you don't?

1772
01:19:01,363 --> 01:19:03,697
- Keep going.
- Right, right. And yes,

1773
01:19:03,698 --> 01:19:07,744
I would rather gouge out my eyeballs
with hot spoons than cause you pain again.

1774
01:19:07,827 --> 01:19:10,830
And yes, I will keep you
on an alabaster pedestal.

1775
01:19:10,914 --> 01:19:12,123
Words.

1776
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:14,709
And yes,

1777
01:19:15,252 --> 01:19:18,296
I will love you and only you
for the rest of my life,

1778
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:19,714
if you will allow me

1779
01:19:19,881 --> 01:19:21,132
(BOX CLICKS OPEN)

1780
01:19:22,759 --> 01:19:26,304
the honor of becoming your husband.

1781
01:19:26,638 --> 01:19:27,722
(GASPS)

1782
01:19:31,309 --> 01:19:33,687
Where the fuck did you get that ring?

1783
01:19:33,728 --> 01:19:35,608
I've had it around for a
while, six years or so.

1784
01:19:35,647 --> 01:19:36,898
Six years?

1785
01:19:37,274 --> 01:19:38,733
So, what do you say?

1786
01:19:39,192 --> 01:19:40,485
Oh, what the hell.

1787
01:19:40,568 --> 01:19:41,945
MOINIGHAN: That's the spirit.

1788
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:43,321
Okay then.

1789
01:19:44,197 --> 01:19:46,658
By the power still vested in me,

1790
01:19:47,033 --> 01:19:49,911
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

1791
01:19:50,245 --> 01:19:51,955
You may kiss the bride.

1792
01:19:52,872 --> 01:19:55,041
(WHOOPING AND APPLAUSE)

1793
01:20:00,755 --> 01:20:02,465
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

1794
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:47,761
Wait a second.

1795
01:21:02,817 --> 01:21:03,818
(CHUCKLES)

1796
01:21:10,658 --> 01:21:11,825
(LAUGHING)

1797
01:21:11,826 --> 01:21:13,578
You'll always love me.

1798
01:21:24,839 --> 01:21:26,299
May I have this dance?

1799
01:21:30,470 --> 01:21:31,638
Oh!

1800
01:21:33,807 --> 01:21:35,308
ANDREW: Ooh, yeah.

1801
01:21:35,392 --> 01:21:37,060
Oh! (LAUGHS)

1802
01:21:38,853 --> 01:21:40,397
Ohh! Oh, Oh.

1803
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:42,232
Oh, some wedding, huh?

1804
01:21:42,315 --> 01:21:43,441
It's my first two-fer.

1805
01:21:43,525 --> 01:21:44,734
Yeah. Congratulations.

1806
01:21:44,818 --> 01:21:45,819
You, too.

1807
01:21:45,860 --> 01:21:49,030
Yeah. You know, you were right.

1808
01:21:49,864 --> 01:21:51,116
About what?

1809
01:21:51,825 --> 01:21:54,077
There are different kinds of love.

1810
01:21:55,286 --> 01:21:56,871
Which one are you feeling now?

1811
01:21:56,913 --> 01:21:58,873
(EXHALES) All Of them.

1812
01:22:11,261 --> 01:22:12,262
Whoo!

1813
01:22:24,482 --> 01:22:26,901
DON: <i>Welcome to the family, baby Jane.</i>

1814
01:22:26,943 --> 01:22:30,822
<i>Lesson one, your grandmothers are all nuts.</i>
