1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:11,192
Touchstone Pictures was formed in 1984
as a separate brand of The Walt Disney Company
to produce films containing
mature elements.

2
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:19,197
Amblin Entertainment
is a production company headed by
Steven Spielberg, Frank Marshall,
and Kathleen Kennedy.

3
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:26,316
SilverScreen Partners III was the last
of three limited partnerships offered
to the public to help finance productions.

4
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,238
Investors received a portion of a film's gross.

5
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,154
Artists studied titles of
various cartoons of the 1940s.

6
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,034
They decided on a look most reminiscent
of Warner Bros. cartoons.

7
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:51,073
Notice how the wood floor
is also animated to move as
the camera changes perspective.

8
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,395
Animated backgrounds
were unusual due to expense.

9
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,910
Mrs. Herman
was voiced by April Winchell.

10
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:08,832
Who was April Winchell's father,
who voiced a famous Disney character?

11
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:18,119
Paul Winchell voiced Tigger,
in addition to other characters.

12
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:24,599
He also hosted a children's TV show
and even invented an early version
of the artificial heart.

13
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:38,477
Animation pioneerTex Avery was
probably the single biggest influence
on the animation comedy style
of Who Framed Roger Rabbit.

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,039
The next shot of Roger is known as a "take;"
a character's sudden reaction.

15
00:01:52,800 --> 00:02:02,357
In an Avery-style take, eyes pop out,
jaws drop to the floor, bodies become
stiff as boards, to visually show
in extreme how a character feels.

16
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:09,078
Avery exaggerated action gags,
through speed and body changes,
as never before.

17
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,317
This influenced everybody's animation.

18
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:24,479
Born in Taylor, Texas, Tex Avery
was a leading Animation Director
at Warner Bros. from 1936 to 1942.

19
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:34,080
Then at M-G-M, he did his most
distinctive work from 1942 through 1954.

20
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:43,600
Later, Avery created TV commercials.
His best known ad shows an insect world's
view of a leading bug spray.

21
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:58,040
Avery developed a following
of young admirers who rediscovered
his work after his death in 1980, at age 72.

22
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:22,035
This is classic "cause-and-effect"
comedy structure.

23
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:29,919
Something happens that causes another event,
which causes a wilder event,
and gags keep building layer upon layer.

24
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:44,519
Silent-film comedians like
Charles Chaplin and Buster Keaton pioneered
comedy stories as a "chain-of-events."

25
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,836
The early Disney animation staff
studied Chaplin's movies.

26
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:02,312
Director Robert Zemeckis stated,
"Moving out of the cartoon into reality
was the crucial scene in the movie.

27
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:08,071
That shot had to work or everything would
be over three minutes after it began."

28
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:15,673
"The last three shots are
subtly rendered so they are not flat
cartoon animation but watercolours.

29
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:23,400
We built a three-dimensional set and painted
it flat, with even the shadows painted on.
All of a sudden the director walks in."

30
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:37,797
Baby Herman was animated
here by Richard Williams,
the film's director of animation.

31
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,638
Director Zemeckis first got excited
about this project-in-development in 1982.

32
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,959
He felt this opening transitional scene,
"was the ultimate concept shot," meaning
it was a great sounding premise for a movie.

33
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,109
Zemeckis feels that a key opening shot
in his movies sets the tone for what follows.

34
00:04:54,280 --> 00:05:00,435
Raoul J. Raoul, the live action
director of"Somethin's Cookin"
is played by Joel Silver

35
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:08,478
better known for his role as producer
of big budget action films such as
Die Hard and the Lethal Weapon series.

36
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:15,671
Born in England,
a 25-year-old Bob Hoskins
(Eddie Valiant) was sitting
in a pub next to a theatre

37
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:21,320
when a stranger told him to go upstairs
and read for the lead in a play.
He actually got the part.

38
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,877
After his first performance,
an agent advised him to take up
acting professionally.

39
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,198
Previously, he had been a porter,
circus fire eater, steeplejack, and seaman.

40
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,999
Eddie glances down at a small
Mickey Mouse figurine on the table.

41
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:46,789
The editor hunched over the moviola
is Morgan Deare, who also voices
Bongo, the ape bouncer
of the Ink and Paint Club.

42
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:57,193
The dialogue is a parody of lyrics
from an Irving Berlin song, "There's
No Business Like Show Business,"
written for Annie Get Your Gun.

43
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:08,837
The filmmakers thought Bob Hoskins
fit the 1940s style of detective better than
a contemporary star such as Harrison Ford.

44
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:14,557
Also considered were Robert Redford,
Jack Nicholson, and Ed Harris.

45
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:22,314
Said Bob, "I got the job because I'm a bit
cartoonish looking myself, don't you think?"

46
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:30,878
Before Roger Rabbit, Actor Bob Hoskins
was in Mona Lisa (1986), which drew acclaim
and an Academy Award® nomination.

47
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,754
This put producers on his trail
to cast him as Eddie Valiant.

48
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:41,716
Alan Tilvern (R.K. Maroon)
spent his early days
as a street market pitchman

49
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:47,312
where he learned to use his voice in
different ways to lure prospective customers.

50
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,992
Using this skill,
Tilvern appeared in more than 50 films,
including Bhowani Junction (1956)

51
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:58,797
Superman (1978), Little Shop Of Horrors (1986),
and the TV mini-series "Anno Domini."

52
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:08,869
Co-Executive Producer
Steven Spielberg had already
created seven of the top ten
grossing movies of all time

53
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:13,516
when he stepped in to help bring
Who Framed Roger Rabbit to the screen.

54
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,028
Spielberg drew top talent to this project.

55
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:22,474
He personally negotiated for
the appearance in one film of characters
owned by various movie studios- a first.

56
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:30,552
Trusting his Roger Rabbit production team,
Spielberg spent a good deal of this time in
China, directing Empire of the Sun (1987).

57
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:42,432
The musical chairs play
"Stars and Stripes Forever"
by John Philip Sousa.

58
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:56,071
This scene was the first completed
effects section. It generated tremendous
excitement and enthusiasm in the crew.

59
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,910
In what movie
did this elephant learn to fly?

60
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:13,597
Dumbo (1941) tells the story of
a baby elephant with ears so large he can fly.

61
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:30,157
In what film did
this ostrich ballerina make her debut?

62
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:40,876
The Ostrich ballet dancer
Mademoiselle Upanova was first seen
in the "Dance of the Hours" segment
of Fantasia (1940).

63
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:49,757
These famous brooms gave
Mickey Mouse a difficult time
in the "Sorcerer's Apprentice"
sequence in Fantasia (1940).

64
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:57,270
Hyacinth Hippo was the prima ballerina
in the "Dance of the Hours"
segment of Fantasia (1940).

65
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:03,589
Eddie's stroll through Maroon Studios
involved more than 180 individual elements.

66
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:11,115
When assembled, the various cel and
film pieces were in stacks eight feet tall
for only 30 seconds of screen time.

67
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,313
Maleficent's Goons
(Sleeping Beauty, Disney, 1959).

68
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:30,990
Brer Bear (Song of the South,
Disney, 1946); Koko the Clown
("Out of the Inkwell" series,
Fleischer, beginning 1919).

69
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:47,071
Co-Executive ProducerSteven Spielberg
asked screenwriters Jeffrey Price
and PeterS. Seamen for an underlying
subplot that motivates the villain.

70
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,999
Remembering the corrupt
water works officials in Chinatown

71
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:57,558
the writers developed
Judge Doom's scheme for the demise
of Los Angeles' transit systems.

72
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,789
Cloverleaf Industries is a take-off
on the name for the winding ramps
of freeway interchanges

73
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,674
which from an overhead view
resemble a four-leaf clover.

74
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:14,990
In 1935, Los Angeles had one of
the largest mass transit systems
in the world, known as the Red Car.

75
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:22,628
Each year more than 3,000 electric
trains carried 80 million passengers
efficiently over a 75-mile radius.

76
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:28,755
Roger Rabbit satirises how certain
American corporations collaborated
to use fake companies as fronts

77
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:35,592
to privatise the nation's streetcar systems
and drive them out of business.

78
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,477
This created a heavier reliance
on automobiles, which consume
more oil and rubber products.

79
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:54,232
In 1949, the bogus companies
were convicted of violating the Sherman
Antitrust Act and fined $5,000 each.

80
00:10:54,280 --> 00:11:00,833
By 1960, 88% of the nation's highly efficient
transit systems had been eliminated.

81
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:09,670
Eddie is in the Terminal Bar,
representing the transportation terminal
that was in downtown Los Angeles.

82
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,840
You can hear a train running
on one of the underground lines.

83
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:30,909
Since Bob Hoskins normally
speaks with a bit of English cockney,
he had to learn to sound American.

84
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:35,078
"It was tough. Accents are a pain.
It takes time. I really have to work at it,"
said Hoskins.

85
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:48,909
Joanna Cassidy left
her New Jersey home at 27
for a career in Hollywood

86
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:55,069
making her debut in
The Laughing Policeman (1972)
with Walter Matthau.

87
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,592
Before Roger Rabbit,
Cassidy worked as a model,
in addition to commercials and TV.

88
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,679
Her films included The Bank Shot (1974)
and The Late Show (1977).

89
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:14,316
She gave a memorable performance
in Blade Runner (1982) as an exotic
"replicant" who dances with snakes.

90
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:19,558
In real life, Miss Cassidy had pet snakes.

91
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:50,715
Although a sequel was often rumoured,
Zemeckis was once quoted as saying

92
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:55,550
"The film was
a once-in-a-generation thing, like E.T."

93
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:05,114
A "prequel" with the working title
"Toon Platoon" nevergot
out of the development stage.

94
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:38,279
The nightclub was named after
the Ink & Paint building on the Disney Studio lot

95
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:45,396
where all the animators' pencil drawings
were hand traced with ink onto
clear celluloid sheets and painted.

96
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,108
"Walt sent me" refers to "Walt Disney."

97
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:56,917
Use of code words like this was a way
to gain admittance to private clubs.

98
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:03,595
The interiors were shot
at London's Elstree Studio.

99
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:10,352
Some sets were built 10 feet above
the soundstage floor to allow the puppeteers
to manipulate props from below.

100
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:21,875
Puppeteer David Alan Barclay
was also the chief puppeteer
forStar Wars' Jabba the Hut.

101
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:31,509
The Ink & Paint Club set was built
to the dimensions of a real nightclub
capable of seating 250-300 patrons.

102
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,428
"Hey, hey! Cut it out!"

103
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:45,756
The Toons' tune is
the "Hungarian Rhapsody" by Franz Liszt.

104
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:55,471
The classical composition was featured
in numerous cartoons, frequently
with characters on stage battling
to finish the piece.

105
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,593
"Doggone stubborn little... I'll get it!"

106
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,034
"Oh, yeah?!"

107
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:22,389
In the 1950s,
Stubby Kaye was a favourite on
the New York musical stage, television

108
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:29,073
and in films such as L'il Abner (1959),
and Guys And Dolls (1957) in which
he sang, "Sit Down You're Rockin' the Boat."

109
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:55,069
Warner Bros. Studio's Toon agents
agreed to this first time loan of their
cartoon stars Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny

110
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:00,319
only if the pairgot equal screen time with
Disney stars Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse.

111
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,920
"This is hot stuff."

112
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:06,794
Who is this white fowl
and when did he make his screen debut?

113
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,398
"Wow!"

114
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:12,353
Donald Duck was introduced
in "The Wise Little Hen" (1934).

115
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,757
His first dialogue?...
"Who, me? Oh, no. I got a bellyache."

116
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,588
Who is this black mallard?

117
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:30,709
Daffy Duck made his debut in
"Porky's Duck Hunt" (Warner Bros., 1937),
directed by Tex Avery, with key scenes
animated by Bob Clampett.

118
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:35,914
Daffy got named in his second cartoon,
"Daffy Duck And Egghead" (1938).

119
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:45,232
This story is set in 1947. Not counting
Jessica, all the Toons in the nightclub
had appeared in movies
by that time except who?

120
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:50,957
The Penguins had been working
as waiters but were not cast in a film
until Mary Poppins, released in 1964.

121
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,438
However, that story took place in 1910,
so the penguins might have been
available for Roger Rabbit's tale.

122
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,996
In the 1930s, Betty Boop
was a very popular character in
mostly black and white cartoons.

123
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:11,354
She was created by
the FleischerStudios, who also started
the Popeye the Sailor cartoon series.

124
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:20,113
Mae Questel was the voice
of Betty Boop from 1930until
the character was retired in 1949.

125
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,871
Miss Questel recreated
her famous character in this
memorable cameo appearance.

126
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:38,791
Jessica's song by Joe McCoy
was a hit for singer Peggy Lee in 1943.

127
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:52,433
From what film
did these jazz musicians come?

128
00:17:52,480 --> 00:18:02,071
The Crows helped Dumbo gain
the confidence to fly in 1941, where they sang
the hit tune "When I See An Elephant Fly."

129
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:12,433
Betty's voice was fashioned af ter Helen Kane,
a popular novelty singer of the 1920s and '30s.

130
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:20,831
Miss Kane coined the "Boop-oop-a-doop"
on stage while making fun of a song
she didn't like, and the phrase caught on.

131
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:29,229
Jessica fashioned herself af ter
the glamorous stars of old Hollywood,
such as Rita Hayworth, Lauren Bacall,
and Jane Russell.

132
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:36,914
Her hairdo was inspired by
Veronica Lake's famous "peek-a-boo" bangs.

133
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,670
Jessica's sultry stage style is an homage
to Red Hot Riding Hood from M-G-M cartoons.

134
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:46,475
Actress Amy Irving provided
the singing voice for Jessica.

135
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:51,310
Irving was known for her role in Yentl (1983)
and was married to Steven Spielberg
at the time.

136
00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:00,952
Jessica was the most complex
character in terms of effects.

137
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:08,632
Separate elements were needed
for her shadow, hair, skin, and dress.

138
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:16,278
Her costume alone required three layers
just to make it shimmer and sparkle.

139
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:41,079
Ed Jones at Industrial Light and Magic
supervised photographing the 1,035
optical illusions needed for Roger Rabbit.

140
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:47,595
Each effect required from 15 to 185 shots.

141
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,320
Effects supervisor Ken Ralston commented,
"It was the equivalent of 10 films."

142
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,435
Effects supervisor Ken Ralston commented,
"It was the equivalent of 10 films."

143
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:47,351
The dark look of the movie was inspired
by the "film noir" black and white
detective mysteries of the 1940s.

144
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,234
Director Zemeckis called this "cartoon noir."

145
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,679
Eddie's character was a spoof
of Humphrey Bogart's portrayals

146
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:03,317
of cynical detectives
Sam Spade in The Maltese Falcon (1941)
and The Big Sleep's Philip Marlowe (1946).

147
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:09,674
The movie Chinatown (1974) was influential
in the making of Roger Rabbit.

148
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:17,195
That film was a stylish detective film set
in 1930s Los Angeles, and was a favourite
of the Roger Rabbit screenwriters.

149
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:46,872
Roger's angst is styled after
Burt Young's character chewing
the Venetian blinds in the movie Chinatown.

150
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:31,791
In keeping with the 1940s period,
Director Robert Zemeckis wanted
classically cartoony sounding voices
for the new characters.

151
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:42,834
Before creating
the original voice of Roger Rabbit,
Charles Fleischer was a stand- up comic

152
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:48,193
who performed regularly
at the Comedy Store in Los Angeles.

153
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:53,268
Zemeckis remembered seeing Fleischer
on stage eight years before making the movie

154
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:57,791
and ultimately called him in
to audition for various Toon roles.

155
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:06,359
Roger morphs into a whistle
once common to signal important
times of the day at factories.

156
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:13,636
Fleischer also read the part of
Roger Rabbit during screen tests
for the Eddie Valiant character.

157
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:18,276
By the third test,
everyone agreed Charlie should be Roger.

158
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,790
No one else was considered.

159
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:30,631
Aftergrowing up in Washington, D. C.,
Charles Fleischer spent 15 years
working night clubs and in minor film roles.

160
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:38,314
He had parts in The Hand (1981), Night Shift
(1982), Nightmare On Elm Street (1984),
and laterStraight Talk (1992).

161
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:44,993
Zemeckis encouraged
Charles's Roger to talk fast and develop
some kind of speech impediment

162
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:51,752
believing most of the best, classic Toons
had unique speech mannerisms.

163
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:20,475
In addition to Roger, Fleischer
also created the voices of Benny the Cab,
and two weasels- Greasy and Psycho.

164
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,317
The rabbit couple dined at
the Brown Derby in Hollywood,
which was famous for
celebrity drawings on the walls.

165
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,634
Find the portrait of Mickey Mouse.

166
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:43,868
The words on the glass door to Eddie's
office are classically photographed
from the inside in the style of
film noir detective movies.

167
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:53,511
Eddie hangs his hat
on a Maltese Falcon, like the prop
in the classic 1941 Warner Bros.
detective movie of the same name.

168
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:10,280
This scene was re-shot and re-edited
after the character design of Jessica changed.

169
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:18,837
After the film, Bob Hoskins took
his family to Antigua for a vacation.

170
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:24,874
Hoskins' wife insisted that
he keep his shirt on while on the beach

171
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,879
since the actor's body was covered
with bruises from the shooting.

172
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:33,948
She did not want to look like a husband basher.

173
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:24,040
Eddie's brother, Teddy, is portrayed
by Eugene Guirterrez only in stills.

174
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:45,073
Richard Le Parmentier
(Lt. Santino) seen in Rollerball (1975),
Star Wars (1977) as General Motti

175
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:50,877
Superman II (1980), and
the TV mini-series "London Embassy" (1987).

176
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:14,513
The Acme Warehouse was actually
an empty electrical testing station
in the Shepherd's Bush area of London.

177
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:22,513
Since they were altering the appearance
of the building, it was necessary
to complete photography
as quickly as possible.

178
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:26,348
There was around-the-clock filming
going on five days a week for six weeks.

179
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:32,630
The palm trees were shipped over from Spain.

180
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:37,310
Who is this ornery pint-sized cowboy?

181
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:43,071
Yosemite Sam first roared onto the screen
in Warner Bros. "Hare Trigger" (1944).

182
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:48,350
Yosemite Sam was
originally voiced by veteran Mel Blanc

183
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:53,713
but the vocally tough character
was recreated here by Joe Alasky.

184
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:38,271
The mallet knocks stacks
ofSinging Swords, which are
featured later in the final duel.

185
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,757
Roger Rabbit merchandise
available to the public ranged from

186
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:55,157
coffee mugs and t-shirts
to expensive jewellery and jackets
with character appliqués.

187
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,957
One rejected proposal
was for an inflatable Jessica doll.

188
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:14,668
Every frame was animated
(24 frames per second) as opposed to
the short cuts taken forTV animation

189
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:20,477
which repeats frames
so that drawings only change every
2nd or 4th frame; sometimes even less.

190
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:29,071
All scenes were hand-drawn.
There were no short cuts and
no computer-assisted graphics.

191
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:37,118
82,080 frames
(with multiple layers of animation)
were hand-drawn for the film.

192
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:45,989
Including concept and story sketches,
Richard Williams estimates that
a million drawings went into making
Who Framed Roger Rabbit.

193
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:03,280
Christopher Lloyd was previously
seen in Back To The Future (1985)
and on the TV series "Taxi."

194
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:14,793
Born in Stamford, Connecticut,
Christopher Lloyd explored his craft
through New York stage work along with
Meryl Streep and Christopher Walken.

195
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:19,709
Director Milos Forman asked
Lloyd to make his film debut in
One Flew OverThe Cuckoo's Nest (1975).

196
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:24,197
His later films included Mel Brooks'

197
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:56,390
What Disney film was also
infested by weasels?

198
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,715
Although these weasels
are unique to Roger Rabbit,
they bear a suspicious resemblance

199
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:08,436
to the slithery villains of
the "Wind in the Willows" segment
of The Adventures
of Ichabod and Mr. Toad (1949).

200
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,756
There, a pack of weasels manage
to overrun the Toad Hall estate.

201
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:18,797
"The Sneezing Weasel"
(Warner Bros. 1938, directed by Tex Avery)
may be a distant cousin.

202
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:04,076
The ingredients of"dip" - turpentine,
acetone, and benzene - are all commonly
used as paint thinners and solvents

203
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:09,319
which of course would destroy
cartoon characters painted on cels.

204
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:05,799
Actor Lou Hirsch
(voice of Adult Baby Herman)
was spotted in the TV mini- series
"London Embassy" (1987)

205
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:12,518
and the movies Superman III (1983)
and Haunted Honeymoon (1986).

206
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:19,671
In the book that inspired the movie,
Baby Herman is 33. Here, he is 50.

207
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:31,309
The comic strip characters of the book
were changed to cartoon stars
to be more cinematic.

208
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:40,392
For character design, artists looked
at dozens of vintage magazine ads
of the 1940s showing babies,

209
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:44,877
as well as the "Baby Weems" sequence
of The Reluctant Dragon (1941).

210
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,755
326 animators and support staff
worked on the film;

211
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,590
254 in London for more than a year
and 72 in Los Angeles for eight months.

212
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:49,636
Roger Rabbit slightly resembles
a very early Walt Disney character,
Oswald the Lucky Rabbit.

213
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:55,630
Both are white rabbits who
walk upright and wear overalls.

214
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:06,034
Early on, Animation Director Williams analysed
the design of Roger
as having a Tex Avery neck
and a Disney body

215
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,832
with the lower face
in the style of Warner Bros. characters.

216
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:18,632
Richard Williams on Roger;
"With the red overalls, white body,
and blue bow tie, he became like
an American flag."

217
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:59,232
As a youngster,
Richard Williams was knocked out by
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937),

218
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:05,549
saying, "I was fascinated
by the fact that cartoons could appear
to walk and talk and even think."

219
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:11,038
That experience started his animation career.

220
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:43,435
Notice how the camera
moves throughout the movie.

221
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:48,270
This made animation extremely difficult
but added to the dimensional look
of the Toons.

222
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:25,234
Roger does a take-off of square-jawed,
comic strip detective Dick Tracy.

223
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:40,832
Animation Director Richard Williams
filmed Charles Fleischer saying
"P-P-Pleeeese" as a guide for animating
the movement of Roger's mouth.

224
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:45,874
As with all the live-action/ animated scenes,
Roger Rabbit was added months later.

225
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:51,119
Hoskins was up to the challenge
of acting alone, but considered
this scene the hardest one to do.

226
00:38:53,880 --> 00:39:02,629
To prepare for scenes like this,
Hoskins studied his three-year-old daughter
with her imaginary playmates.

227
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:11,558
Richard Williams and Robert Zemeckis
agreed there could be no cost cutting
that could spoil the illusion.

228
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:19,188
All animation would be
hand drawn for each frame of film
(24 frames equal one second on the screen).

229
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:26,954
Animation Director Richard Williams
commented about how Toons had been
combined with humans in past films;

230
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,313
"You see the trick and are not able
to suspend your disbelief."

231
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:45,758
Animation Director Richard Williams
set out to break three rules that previously
had been conventions for combining
live action with animation.

232
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:53,480
1. Move the camera as much
as possible so the Toons don't look
pasted onto flat backgrounds.

233
00:39:54,480 --> 00:40:04,958
2. Use lighting and shadows to an extreme
that had never before been attempted
(each shadow required at least
five optical effects elements).

234
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:12,509
3. Have the Toons interact with real world
objects and people as much as possible.

235
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:24,069
Each weasel in these scenes had five layers
of special, hand painted, lighting effects
to give them a three-dimensional quality.

236
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:32,198
That added up to 25 pieces of artwork
for each frame or 600 drawings per second.

237
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:37,075
Before the weasel got a hold
of this soap, it was carried around
the live-action set by a puppeteer.

238
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:41,910
The puppeteer with the thinnest hand
was chosen so that his hand could
later be covered up by the Toon.

239
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:05,955
Because the camera kept moving,
changing the point of view

240
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:13,680
animators had to work extra hard
so the Toons wouldn't appear to be
slipping or sliding around over the set.

241
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:54,317
Mae West was an actress who gained
great popularity in the 1930s. Her comedy
was marked by its campy, suggestive humour.

242
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:04,473
Dolores's upcoming line is a parody of
a typical Mae West line, "Is that a gun in
your pocket or are you just happy to see me?"

243
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:18,913
Animation Director Williams commented
how an early comedy team
influenced this film;

244
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:26,150
"Laurel and Hardy are funny
because they're constantly getting
tangled up physically with each other."

245
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:35,711
"We thought the cartoon characters
should always be affecting their environment
orgetting tangled up with the live actors."

246
00:42:50,720 --> 00:43:00,311
Filmmakers originally planned
to have 40 minutes of animation,
but ended up with 55 minutes
out of the total 104 minutes of the film.

247
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:08,960
The animation took two years to complete,
with animators sometimes having
to work 20 hours a day to meet deadlines.

248
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:42,278
Following this scene, the film's original script
included Marvin Acme's funeral.

249
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:52,195
Planned as a major animated sequence,
the idea went only as far as storyboards
and preliminary dialogue recording
before being abandoned.

250
00:43:52,240 --> 00:44:01,478
At the funeral,
Eddie was to get a clue that lead to
another scene that was also deleted here.

251
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:09,279
In that sequence, Judge Doom caught
Eddie snooping around Jessica's room.

252
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:15,919
To teach him a lesson, Doom had the weasels
take the nosey detective to Toontown.

253
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:26,876
Moments later in that deleted scene,
Eddie is kicked out of Toontown
with a cartoon pig on his head.

254
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:33,190
To cover the deletion, Eddie answers Dolores
off camera - a line change dubbed in later.

255
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:41,155
He returns to his office to wash
the painted pig head off with turpentine.

256
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:45,990
That's why he is coming out
of the shower here.

257
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:54,598
As with most films,
many bits like that were trimmed out
of the movie to keep the pace going.

258
00:44:54,640 --> 00:45:01,034
In addition, co-writer Jeffrey Price
thought it was funnier to show
the similarity between humans and Toons

259
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:05,198
rather than bringing attention
to their differences.

260
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:22,437
Portions of the "Pig Head Sequence"
were cut back into
the 1991 CBS telecast of the film.

261
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:29,110
The original theatrical trailer
also contained some of the footage.

262
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:57,754
"You'll never work in this town again,"
is a cliché line about how film industry
executives abuse power
to threaten people into cooperation.

263
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:11,711
Actress Kathleen Turner wanted to
work again with director Zemeckis
after Romancing The Stone (1984).

264
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:18,074
As Jessica's voice, she asked for
her performance to be uncredited.
It didn't stay a secret for long.

265
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:28,548
Joanna Cassidy changed
her hair colour because her natural red
was too similar to Jessica's red hair.

266
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:32,479
Perhaps Jessica didn't want any competition.

267
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:49,317
The film had been in and out of development
for four years when exterior filming
finally began in Los Angeles, California
in December, 1986.

268
00:46:52,600 --> 00:47:05,274
On Richard Williams' first trip
to Disney Studios in 1948, he stayed
at the YMCA on Hope Street in
downtown Los Angeles... this same street!

269
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:48,240
This tune became so well known
because it was used
as what theme music?

270
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:58,757
"The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down"
is the familiar theme song for
the Warner Bros. Looney Tunes cartoons.

271
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:09,311
The original Friend-Franklyn song
has lyrics, although they were
not used for the cartoon overture.

272
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:15,070
Roger's lyrics were written
just for this film.

273
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:45,750
"Toon" was popularised
for the first time in this film
to describe an animated character
from the cartoon world.

274
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:02,799
Costume Designer
Joanna Johnston specialised
in period costumes

275
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:10,793
withThe French Lieutenant's Woman (1981),
Pirates of Penzance (1982), and
Indiana Jones and the Temple Of Doom (1984).

276
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:25,395
Miss Johnston won Academy Awards®
for her clothing designs in Tess (1979)
and Death on the Nile (1978).

277
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:45,518
Production Designer
Elliot Scott began
designing sets in 1933

278
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:50,509
and became
Supervising Art Director
at M-G-M's British studio.

279
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:58,592
Scott helped create the atmosphere of films
like Mogambo (1953), Tom Thumb (1958),
The Haunting (1963)

280
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:05,352
The Americanization of Emily (1964),
Dragonslayer (1981) and
the second Indiana Jones film in 1984.

281
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:30,873
The bar patron introduces Judge Doom
to a non-existent "Harvey."

282
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:37,075
Harvey was a comedy play produced in 1944
about a man with an invisible rabbit friend.

283
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:45,278
Jimmy Stewart starred in
the 1950 film adaptation.

284
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:00,708
Before CDs, music was played on records.

285
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:09,350
This vintage 1920s-style gramophone
had a heavy needle that projected
the sound through a metal horn.

286
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:16,078
The first records only played one song
and rotated at 78 revolutions per minute (rpm).

287
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:21,831
78s, as they were called, were easily
breakable before soft vinyl was developed.

288
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:26,395
Doom is tapping out the rhythmic phrase,
"Shave and a haircut..."
which is answered musically, "Two bits."

289
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:32,758
Two bits is slang for a quarter- 25 cents.

290
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:09,754
Zemeckis described
giving feedback to the animators;

291
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:15,716
"I worked with the performances
[not details of the drawings],
the same way I would an actor in rehearsal.

292
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,832
They'd sketch a pose as I explained."

293
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:31,394
Animator Dave Spafford commented,
"Bob Hoskins was so good
he stole the show in every shot."

294
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:37,595
"We knew we'd be in trouble
if he was more animated than we were.

295
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:41,315
We had to pull all the stops out
to compete with him."

296
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:05,920
This arguing banter to confuse
someone by changing pronouns
was a standard comedy routine.

297
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:13,796
Warner Bros. first used it
in "A Wild Hare" (1940).

298
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:18,550
The classic cartoon, "Rabbit Seasoning" (1952)
was built around repeating this gag

299
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:23,151
with Daffy Duck declaring his
now famous realisation, "Pronoun trouble."

300
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:54,795
A longer, more involved fight in the bar
was filmed, but cut for pacing.

301
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:12,040
Each frame of a live-action scene
was transferred into a large
black and white photograph.

302
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:21,556
The animators registered their drawings
on top of each photo to know where
the characters should be in a scene.

303
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:32,111
Later, the finished, colour animation
was combined with the colour,
live-action film through special cameras.

304
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:38,874
Director Robert Zemeckis expressed
his trust in Animation Director
Richard Williams by stating

305
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:43,675
"I never worried about the animation.
I knew it would be breathtaking."

306
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:51,479
Benny refers to a running joke in this era
that it never rained in California,
known as the land of perpetual sunshine.

307
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:58,679
Benny makes a period joke about
the Brooklyn Dodgers baseball team.

308
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:03,669
Later than the time of this film,
they moved to California.

309
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:12,829
In the novel, Benny was a beetle,
not a cab, and had a very minor part.

310
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:37,394
Some scenes of Eddie Valiant
in the taxi are actually drawings,
not live-action footage of Bob Hoskins.

311
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:58,912
The sign suddenly appearing
is a Tex Avery-style gag.

312
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:11,076
Benny references a "bridge,"
as the middle section of a song,
which connects two musical ideas.

313
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:23,073
This is the Hyperion Bridge
in Los Angeles' Silverlake-Atwater
region, near DodgerStadium.

314
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:27,113
In real life, this street
leads to the site of the 1930s
Walt Disney Studios on Hyperion Avenue

315
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:31,119
where Mickey Mouse and Snow White
were created just a few blocks ahead.

316
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:44,550
The cartoon is "Goofy Gymnastics" (1949).

317
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:09,557
The success of the cartoon at the beginning
of the feature led to the creation of
three more Roger Rabbit short subjects.

318
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:22,877
"Tummy Trouble"
was released in the summer of 1989
with the feature, Honey, I Shrunk the Kids.

319
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:32,117
It was the first new Disney
short cartoon release
since "Goofy's Freeway Trouble" in 1965.

320
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:41,114
To maintain the quality established
in the feature, "Tummy Trouble"
was the most expensive
short cartoon ever made.

321
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:45,915
It took four months to create.

322
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:52,593
AnimatorTom Sito
pointed out that for "Tummy Trouble"
they had to develop an ending format

323
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:57,430
since the cartoon in the feature
stops before the story is finished.

324
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:11,913
For "Roller Coaster Rabbit,"
Director Rob Minkoff said they tried
to "keep Roger up in the air and take
Tex Avery's style to the Nth degree."

325
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:21,432
"Trail Mix-Up" was released in 1993
with A Far Off Place.

326
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:40,593
A key animator for Roger Rabbit
was James Baxter, who was
the main animator for Belle
in Beauty and the Beast (1991).

327
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:48,908
Already a successful animator,
Richard Williams said, "When I saw
the tiger in The Jungle Book (Disney, 1967),
I was bowled over.

328
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,709
I thought,
I don't know beans about animation."

329
00:59:52,760 --> 01:00:01,714
Williams then went on a new 10-year
training effort to further improve his craft.

330
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:13,231
On the screen is a newsreel.
The Studios produced these
10-minute summaries of world events.

331
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:18,955
Like short cartoons, they were
shown in theatres before features.

332
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:23,790
That's how people saw
the news before television.

333
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:33,351
There was a theatre in the old theatre
district of downtown Los Angeles
that showed nothing but newsreels.

334
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:39,110
Newsreels were produced up into the 1960s.

335
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:01,320
This scene was shot during a two-day period
at Gray's State Theatre in Essex, England.

336
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:07,953
This scene was shot during a two-day period
at Gray's State Theatre in Essex, England.

337
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:20,354
At 2,000 seats it was the largest
single screen theatre still operating in Europe.

338
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:42,432
The Ren MarStudio in Los Angeles
doubled for Maroon Studios.

339
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:53,471
The close-up of the soundstages
at Maroon Cartoon Studios were filmed
at the Shepherd's Bush Bus Depot
in London, England.

340
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:30,555
Universal Studios
put Steven Spielberg
under contract after seeing
his short film, Amblin

341
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:36,869
which he made as a student at
California State University at Long Beach.

342
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:44,791
Spielberg scored his first hit with
the made-for-TV suspense thriller Duel (1971).

343
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:54,351
Feature films followed with
Sugarland Express (1974), Jaws (1975),
and Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977).

344
01:02:55,320 --> 01:03:04,752
Born in Cincinnati, Ohio,
and raised in Phoenix, Arizona,
Spielberg started making movies at age 13.

345
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:15,472
Spielberg went on to become a successful
filmmaker, and in 1984 he formed his own
production company, Amblin Entertainment.

346
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:41,435
Co-producer Robert Watts helped bring
to the screen numerous landmark films

347
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:47,749
such as Thunderball (1965), 2001 (1968),
Star Wars (1977), and Return of the Jedi (1983).

348
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:52,635
Robert Watts said Roger Rabbit was
the most difficult of all the films he'd done.

349
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:57,470
But in the end it was worthwhile
because it was unique.

350
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:05,630
Editor ArthurSchmidt "cut his teeth"
on Marathon Man (1976)

351
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:12,119
and later edited Idolmaker (1980),
Back to the Future (1985),
and Ruthless People (1986).

352
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:21,159
Schmidt received an Academy Award®
nomination for his work on
Coal Miner's Daughter (1980).

353
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:30,760
Co-producer Frank Marshall
gave up law school for film production.

354
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:38,876
Marshall's credits include
What's Up, Doc? (1972), Paper Moon (1973),
Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), E.T. (1982),

355
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:40,200
Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984),
and Back to the Future (1985).

356
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:46,070
Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984),
and Back to the Future (1985).

357
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:55,515
Richard Williams received
240 awards prior to Roger Rabbit

358
01:04:55,560 --> 01:05:02,272
among them an Academy Award
in 1972 for "A Christmas Carol"
as the Best Animated Short Subject.

359
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:19,480
This movie inspired
a whole new land at Disneyland Park®,
called "Mickey's Toontown."

360
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:33,553
This tunnel to Toontown was also used as

361
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:43,316
The tunnel was photographed near
the Griffith Park Observatory
in Los Angeles, California.

362
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:53,349
The plaque inside of Eddie's Toon
gun case reads, "Thanks forgetting me
out of the Hoosegow. Yosemite Sam"

363
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:57,075
Hoosegow is slang for jail.

364
01:05:57,120 --> 01:06:06,711
The left bullet is voiced by character actor
Pat Buttram, whose voices for Disney included
The Aristocats (1970) and Robin Hood (1973).

365
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:30,831
The inscription and bullets suggest
the previous, close relationship
Eddie had with the Toons.

366
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:45,518
Bob Hoskins exaggerated
his movements once inside Toontown.

367
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:55,116
Bob Hoskins said, "Eddie had to be
part cartoon himself, yet not too broad,
in order to make the film believable.

368
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:58,436
I hallucinated all the Toons."

369
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:24,356
The song "Smile, Darn Ya, Smile"
is featured in a 1931 Warner Bros.
Merrie Melodie cartoon with the same title.

01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:27,278

382
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:20,911
Discarded ideas included chasing
Jessica through several buildings,
and across a desert.

383
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:28,154
Who is this cute, quiet canine critter?

384
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:34,874
The basset hound Droopy was
a Tex Avery creation at M-G-M.

385
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:41,109
Droopy's personality was based on
the voice of Bill Thompson as Mr. Whipple
on the "Fibber McGee and Molly" radio show.

386
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:45,597
Directing Animator Richard Williams
gave voice to Droopy.

387
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:50,031
Apparently he spoke for Droopy during
storyboard meetings and got the job.

388
01:08:57,160 --> 01:09:03,599
The gags with Lena Hyena were inspired
by Grandma in the M-G-M Tex Avery cartoons

389
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:09,636
"Red Hot Riding Hood" (1943),
"Swing Shift Cinderella" and
"Little Rural Riding Hood" (both 1949).

390
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,960
The Doorknob
(Alice in Wonderland, Disney, 1951)

391
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:16,111
The Doorknob
(Alice in Wonderland, Disney, 1951)

392
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:31,910
Who is the cute canary?

393
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:44,914
Tweety played "This little piggy..."
in his screen debut, "A Tale of Two Kitties"
(Warner Bros., 1942),
and it became a trademark gag.

394
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:49,670
Bob Hoskins was excited
about playing Eddie Valiant

395
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:54,475
"because I wanted to tell my grandchildren
I once co-starred with Bugs Bunny."

396
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:03,272
Mickey Mouse celebrated his 60th birthday
during the release of this film.

397
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:09,555
Although Wayne Allwine had performed
as Mickey Mouse previously

398
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:14,390
Allwine became Mickey's new
official voice at the time of this film

399
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:19,230
through the establishment
of the Disney Character Voices
department in 1988.

400
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:27,515
Lena Hyena (Toon Hag in the credits)
was voiced by actress June Foray

401
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:35,717
best known for
Rocky the Flying Squirrel and Natasha in
"The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle."

402
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:45,829
June Foray also voiced Granny
for the Warner Bros.
Tweety and Sylvester cartoons
and the weasel Wheezy's voice in this film.

403
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:59,872
Eddie's shadow
impersonates Dick Tracy.

404
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:09,358
"Cartoon" is derived from
the Italian "cartone," (cardboard).

405
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:15,635
Originally it referred
to an artist's preparatory drawing
copied onto another surface

406
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:21,789
as an outline for creating paintings,
tapestries, and other forms of finished art.

407
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:28,830
Later, newspapers published single-panel
editorial cartoons and comic strip stories.

408
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:35,875
After motion pictures were invented,
pencil drawings came to life on film.

409
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:41,278
Those animated shorts in the early 1900s
were called cartoons, and the name lasted.

410
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:56,312
The poster behind Jessica
is for Blamo exploding cigars.

411
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:08,791
Bob Hoskins' son was reportedly upset
that his father hadn't brought any of
Dad's cartoon co- stars home to meet him.

412
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:33,076
Director Robert Zemeckis had previously
directed Romancing the Stone (1984)
starring Kathleen Turner

413
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:39,036
and the mega hit Back to the Future (1985).

414
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:48,637
Born in Chicago, Zemeckis
won a Best Student Film award
at USC for "Field of Honor" in 1973.

415
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:59,193
Steven Spielberg was so impressed with
the film, he hired Zemeckis to direct
the feature about Beatles' fans,
I Wanna Hold Your Hand (1978).

416
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:08,638
Zemeckis directed
and co-wrote 1941, released in 1979,
and Used Cars (1980) starring Kurt Russell.

417
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:14,994
Russell later screen tested as Eddie Valiant.

418
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:24,158
Zemeckis said Who Framed Roger Rabbit
was "akin to scaling Mt. Everest."

419
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:45,638
Robert Zemeckis originally saw a draft
of the script in 1982 and was intrigued.

420
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:52,279
The project did not progress until 1985 when
the new management at Disney teamed with
Steven Spielberg to combine their resources.

421
01:13:54,880 --> 01:14:01,558
Zemeckis, who had just directed
Back To The Future (1985) forSpielberg,
was offered the new script.

422
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:08,278
The search began for a suitably zany,
unconventional animation director
who could help bring the project to life.

423
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:14,753
London-based animator
Richard Williams
had previously created
beverage commercials forTV

424
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:20,033
that combined dimensional-looking animation
with live action in a realistic way.

425
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:28,476
Williams had also finished some
unusual scenes on his pet project
The Thief and the Cobbler.

426
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:34,675
These works caught the attention
of Roger Rabbit producers
Frank Marshall and Robert Watts

427
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:41,068
and the whole team realised
Williams was the talent
for whom they'd been searching.

428
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:48,871
Animation Director Richard Williams
animated the opening titles for
Return Of The Pink Panther (1975)

429
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:53,914
The Pink PantherStrikes Again (1976),
What's New Pussycat? (1965),
and Casino Royale (1967).

430
01:14:53,960 --> 01:15:00,832
The yellow hole
is a silhouette of Mickey Mouse.

431
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:23,031
The filmmakers chose 1947 for
a "Once upon a time" quality to make
the premise more acceptable,
like a fairy tale.

432
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:37,359
Judge Doom, Dolores, R.K. Maroon,
the weasels, and the transit system subplot were
inventions for the film
not in the original novel.

433
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:58,035
The number 10 was Los Angeles' first freeway.

434
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:02,870
It travelled the route Doom describes
but has fewer lanes.

435
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:05,753
His comments were sort of an inside joke
for L.A. audiences.

436
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:54,991
Originally budgeted at $27.5 million,
the film ended up costing around $45 million,

437
01:17:55,040 --> 01:18:00,797
making it one of the most
expensive movies of its time.

438
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:10,392
The animation averaged between
$250,000 and $300,000 a minute.

439
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:45,640
A menacing shadow is cast on the back wall.

440
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:46,436
A menacing shadow is cast on the back wall.

441
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:51,634
George Gibbs supervised
30 special effects technicians
in advanced servo-hydraulics

442
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:53,716
computerised electronics,
and micro-robotics

443
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:57,355
to manipulate the real objects that
the Toons would later appear to be moving.

444
01:18:57,400 --> 01:19:02,155
His special effects work can also be seen
in Superman (1978), Flash Gordon (1980)

445
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:05,590
Conan the Barbarian (1982) and
Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984).

446
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:17,071
On this film, Gibbs said he was
most proud of inventing the Dipmobile.

447
01:19:55,680 --> 01:20:01,391
Bob Hoskins believes there's
a little bit of a toughguy in everyone.

448
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:07,151
"The good thing about being
an actor is that you can let it out,
then go home and be a nice guy."

449
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:28,151
Freeze frame the shot when
Eddie presses a button for the calliope,
and check out the "tunes."

450
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:54,878
Find the "hidden Mickey"
when Eddie dances.

451
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:05,471
The bowling balls formed into a V
create that familiar silhouette.

452
01:21:51,840 --> 01:22:00,396
Cinematographer Dean Cundey
became adept at handling effects films
withThe Thing (1982)

453
01:22:00,440 --> 01:22:04,353
Back To The Future (1985),
and Big Business (1988).

454
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:11,075
He also worked with Zemeckis
on Romancing The Stone (1984).

455
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:22,515
Cundey originally studied to be
an art director. After a cinematography
course at UCLA, he switched.

456
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:30,554
"I discovered you could change
the mood of a scene or the look
of a set just by different lighting.

457
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:35,594
I wanted to deal with (those elemente)
instead of backgrounds."

458
01:22:57,280 --> 01:23:06,951
The upcoming "Singing Sword" gag may have
been inspired by the Academy Award®
winning Warner Bros. cartoon
"Knighty Knight Bugs" (1958).

459
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:18,480
The Singing Sword bears the likeness of
singer Frank Sinatra and croons several bars
of his Coleman-Leigh hit "Witchcraft."

460
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:42,392
The ends of the lightning bolts
have hands on them trying to pull
Judge Doom's sword away from him.

461
01:23:50,440 --> 01:24:00,031
Composer Alan Silvestri plays drums,
piano, guitar, and woodwinds, and
originally started out to be a musician
touring with bands.

462
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:07,115
Silvestri got stranded in Los Angeles
when a record deal fell through,

463
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:12,473
but was hired to write
music for the TV series "CHiPs,"
which began his composing career.

464
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:19,237
Silvestri was hired by director Zemeckis
to compose Romancing the Stone (1984)

465
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:25,674
followed by Back to the Future (1985),
whichgarnered two
Grammy® Award nominations.

466
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:37,829
Silvestri also scored Flight of the Navigator
(1986) and Outrageous Fortune (1987).

467
01:24:56,080 --> 01:25:05,591
BothSteven Spielberg and Terry Gilliam
considered directing this movie,
but ultimately chose different projects.

468
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:57,717
Richard Williams was reluctant
to accept the Roger Rabbit project.

469
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:06,031
Williams was concerned about the years
away from his established commercial work and
his continuing pet feature project,
The Thief and the Cobbler.

470
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:15,355
Veteran Animation Director
Chuck Jones encouraged Williams
to join the Zemeckis-Spielberg team,

471
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:20,838
saying, "You can't turn down a chance
to work with these guys."

472
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:26,000
Jones also consulted on the film.

473
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:37,474
After 27 years in and out of production,
The Thief and the Cobbler was finished

474
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:42,640
and released in 1995 by Miramax,
under the title Arabian Knight.

475
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:50,199
The video release
went back to the original title.

476
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:22,079
Academy Award® winner Ken Ralston,
previously supervised effects for
StarTrek II (1982), Cocoon (1983)

477
01:27:22,120 --> 01:27:29,196
StarTrek III (1984),

478
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:13,430
What famous lines does Doom use?

479
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:33,356
Doom quotes the Wicked Witch of the West's
death by water from The Wizard of Oz (1939).

480
01:28:53,280 --> 01:29:01,233
Play the moving train frame-by-frame
and look for cameos in the windows.

481
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:36,677
The two trees embracing were the stars
of "Flowers and Trees," Walt Disney's
first colourSilly Symphony cartoon (1932).

482
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:55,193
After the film's success, there were
a slew of TV commercials that tried
to imitate Roger's combination
animation-and-live-action techniques.

483
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,878
Peter (Peter and the Wolf, 1946)

What was Steven Spielberg's
Amblin Entertainment's
next association with
Warner Bros. cartoons?

490
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:17,472
Steven Spielberg teamed
with Warner Bros. to produce
the TV series "Tiny Toons."

491
01:31:26,200 --> 01:31:29,988
Based on a youngergeneration
of Looney Tunes characters,
the series debuted in 1990-

492
01:31:30,040 --> 01:31:33,874
sixty years after the first
Warner Bros. theatrical cartoon was made.

493
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:27,272
Animators sang for the final reprise
of"Smile, Darn Ya, Smile."

494
01:32:52,160 --> 01:32:56,950
Who is this "hammy" actor?

495
01:32:57,960 --> 01:33:07,517
After his 1935 debut, Porky Pig closed
many of the early Warner Bros. Looney Tunes
cartoons with this now familiar signature.

496
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:18,791
Screenwriters Jeffrey Price
and PeterS. Seamen met working
together at an advertising agency.

497
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:25,188
The team also wrote Trenchcoat (1983),
and later Wild, Wild West (1999) and
How The GrinchStole Christmas (2000).

498
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:39,154
Kathleen Kennedy began her career at
a San Diego TV station while still in college.

499
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:48,233
Kennedy went on to co-produce movies
such as E.T. (1982), The Color Purple (1985),
and Back to the Future (1985).

500
01:33:50,160 --> 01:33:59,751
Some live actors turned down the role
of Eddie Valiant because they were
concerned about being upstaged by a Toon.

501
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:15,797
Don Hahn went on to produce
such Disney classics as
Beauty and the Beast (1991)
and The Lion King (1994).

Although the film's title is a question,
no question mark appears in the title

527
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:02,790
as that is considered bad luck
in the film industry.

528
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:15,632
Didn't see some of your favourite Toons?
Perhaps they weren't around in 1947.
