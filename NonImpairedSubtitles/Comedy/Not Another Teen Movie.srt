1
00:00:12,086 --> 00:00:16,113
Ijust hope it doesn't cause any
permanent damage.

2
00:00:21,496 --> 00:00:25,728
-How long have you been here, anyway?
-A while.

3
00:00:27,602 --> 00:00:30,435
-You missed yourprom?
-Yeah.

4
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:39,847
The thing is, when I made that bet--

5
00:00:40,348 --> 00:00:44,512
There he is. It's Freddie.
He's wearing a tux.

6
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,519
What's up? I met a whole other
person inside ofyou.

7
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:53,124
There's a whole otherperson
inside ofboth of us.

8
00:01:17,986 --> 00:01:20,454
Would the whole otherperson...

9
00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:23,723
...like to dance?

10
00:01:25,827 --> 00:01:27,522
Yes.

11
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,121
-Morning, sweetie!
-Daddy!

12
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:34,162
-Why are you in here?
-Why am I in here?

13
00:01:34,402 --> 00:01:36,336
It's her birthday, Dad.

14
00:01:36,537 --> 00:01:39,199
Happy birthday, sweetie.

15
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:46,709
-What's that buzzing sound?
-I just need a minute, here.

16
00:01:46,914 --> 00:01:48,882
Maybe it's that construction.

17
00:01:49,183 --> 00:01:51,344
Where's my little angel?

18
00:01:51,552 --> 00:01:53,179
Happy birthday, honey.

19
00:01:53,421 --> 00:01:54,615
Grandma? Grandpa?

20
00:01:54,822 --> 00:01:56,255
Rosco!

21
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,585
Rosco, go.

22
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,457
-Hello.
-Father O'Flannagan?

23
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,897
I brought your special friends
from the center!

24
00:02:08,102 --> 00:02:10,627
-Happy birthday!
-Janey's making faces.

25
00:02:10,838 --> 00:02:12,669
It smells in here.

26
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:14,907
Okay, make a wish, dear.

27
00:02:15,877 --> 00:02:17,071
No.

28
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:47,073
This isn't a typical high school.

29
00:02:47,275 --> 00:02:51,905
At John Hughes, there are no cliques,
no exclusive social groups.

30
00:02:52,113 --> 00:02:55,571
You're accepted for you,
not who you hang out with.

31
00:02:55,783 --> 00:02:59,947
We'll divide into groups
so you can get to know your peers.

32
00:03:00,154 --> 00:03:03,453
Let's get all you jocks
in one group...

33
00:03:03,658 --> 00:03:07,185
...and get you slutty girls
over here by me.

34
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:09,659
Hey, how you doing?
Welcome.

35
00:03:09,864 --> 00:03:12,697
You losers should
hang out in the back.

36
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,461
That clearly includes you.
Come on, get back there.

37
00:03:16,671 --> 00:03:19,469
Take a look at the kid
standing beside you.

38
00:03:21,676 --> 00:03:24,736
They're your only friends
for the next four years.

39
00:03:24,946 --> 00:03:27,210
Okay, let's move it, people!

40
00:03:37,191 --> 00:03:41,560
-You need to start dating.
-I don't date. You know that.

41
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,594
Janey, you know Dad's rule.

42
00:03:43,798 --> 00:03:45,663
I can't have sex before you.

43
00:03:45,867 --> 00:03:49,098
I don't conform to
typical high-school norms.

44
00:03:49,303 --> 00:03:53,672
I read Sylvia Plath,
listen to Bikini Kill and eat tofu.

45
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:57,333
-I'm a unique rebel.
-More like you're a lesbo.

46
00:03:57,545 --> 00:03:59,979
Mitch, leave your sister alone.

47
00:04:00,181 --> 00:04:01,580
Thank you, Daddy.

48
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:06,186
If Janey wants to be a rug-muncher,
that's her decision.

49
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:10,521
Go! Fight! Win!

50
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:19,060
Nice combination, Crissy!

51
00:04:24,205 --> 00:04:27,197
I've been meaning to get that fixed.

52
00:04:27,608 --> 00:04:29,235
Later, Dad.

53
00:04:31,212 --> 00:04:33,339
I'll be late to pick you up.

54
00:04:33,548 --> 00:04:35,516
Why? A job interview?

55
00:04:35,716 --> 00:04:39,174
No, honey.
I'll probably just be way too drunk.

56
00:04:39,387 --> 00:04:41,947
That's good.
No drinking and driving.

57
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:46,024
Oh, I'll be driving.
I'll just be too drunk to remember.

58
00:04:46,761 --> 00:04:48,752
Okay. Bye, Daddy.

59
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:51,054
Bye, pumpkin-head.

60
00:04:56,604 --> 00:04:59,095
-Oh, my God!
-Get out of the road!

61
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:18,925
Oh, my God, it's Jake.

62
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:22,288
-Hi, stud.
-Hi, Jake.

63
00:05:22,496 --> 00:05:26,364
-I love that thing with his eyebrows.
-Those sideburns.

64
00:05:26,567 --> 00:05:30,663
Oh, my God, there's Jake.
He's so popular.

65
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:32,763
He just looked at me.

66
00:05:32,974 --> 00:05:35,636
-Here. You can keep it.
-Tiff.

67
00:05:35,843 --> 00:05:38,573
Hi, Jake. It's all wet.

68
00:05:38,913 --> 00:05:40,574
Melanie.

69
00:05:40,781 --> 00:05:42,806
Hey, Jake.

70
00:05:43,017 --> 00:05:45,247
Hey, Arthur.

71
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:56,086
Here's Ricky!

72
00:05:56,297 --> 00:05:58,322
Hey, Ricky.
How was your weekend?

73
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,202
Friday night I stood
outside your window in the rain...

74
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:04,996
...screaming your name.

75
00:06:05,606 --> 00:06:09,372
Then I spent Saturday and Sunday
making you this great...

76
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:13,843
...l've-been-desperately-trying-
to-tell-you-that...

77
00:06:14,048 --> 00:06:16,380
...l'm-madly-in-love-with-you...

78
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,643
...mix tape for your birthday.

79
00:06:18,853 --> 00:06:22,186
A mix tape?
That's so sweet, Ricky.

80
00:06:23,658 --> 00:06:25,717
See you in English.

81
00:06:28,696 --> 00:06:30,891
Catch you guy later.

82
00:06:33,668 --> 00:06:35,568
What happening?

83
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,262
Damn, Shorty, Dog is pretending
to be Asian, and shit.

84
00:06:39,473 --> 00:06:44,240
That cracker is white!
Can't he see that, yo?

85
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:47,175
Did you get any action this weekend?

86
00:06:47,381 --> 00:06:51,010
-I visit grandfather.
-I played with my sisters.

87
00:06:51,218 --> 00:06:52,583
We're pathetic.

88
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:56,484
How will we ever lose our virginity
by graduation?

89
00:06:56,691 --> 00:06:59,421
-We're freshmen.
-What's with the attitude?

90
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:03,256
-Not easy to get lucky here.
-Girls are sensitive.

91
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:07,594
They're not looking for sex.
They're looking for love.

92
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:10,771
Love me! Harder!

93
00:07:17,745 --> 00:07:19,940
Amanda Becker.

94
00:07:20,448 --> 00:07:24,009
She is so perfect.

95
00:07:34,095 --> 00:07:35,153
Keep dreaming.

96
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:37,859
What's up, Reggie Ray?

97
00:07:38,065 --> 00:07:40,431
I can't wait until Friday's game.

98
00:07:40,768 --> 00:07:45,205
What about your head? You have
a blood clot the size of a grapefruit.

99
00:07:45,406 --> 00:07:49,502
Five more concussions and you'll die.
You should take it easy.

100
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:52,736
-Don't listen to him.
-Austin.

101
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:57,781
Mr. Not-First-String-Anymore,
isn't first-string anymore.

102
00:07:59,754 --> 00:08:03,246
We know what happened last time
Jake called the plays.

103
00:08:03,457 --> 00:08:05,925
And now, ourhometown hero...

104
00:08:06,127 --> 00:08:09,426
...first-string quarterback,
Jake Wyler!

105
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:12,997
Malik, could you hold these books?

106
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:16,097
Sure. Why not?
I am the token black guy.

107
00:08:16,303 --> 00:08:18,794
I smile, stay out of
the conversation...

108
00:08:19,073 --> 00:08:24,443
...and say things like "Damn,"
"Shit," and "That is whack!"

109
00:08:41,128 --> 00:08:44,996
What's she doing here?
She graduated four years ago.

110
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:48,635
-Hi, Jake.
-Catherine.

111
00:08:48,836 --> 00:08:50,463
Can I ask you a question?

112
00:08:50,671 --> 00:08:54,004
Why is it when I tell a guy
to put it anywhere...

113
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:57,200
-...they always stick it in my ass?
-Damn!

114
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,538
Way too much information.

115
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:04,116
Oh, no. Too much information
would be telling you...

116
00:09:04,318 --> 00:09:07,287
...that after they're done
I take a huge dump.

117
00:09:07,488 --> 00:09:09,479
Shit!

118
00:09:11,225 --> 00:09:12,351
On their chest.

119
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,158
Oh, that is whack!

120
00:09:30,578 --> 00:09:32,637
Priscilla, there you are.

121
00:09:32,847 --> 00:09:36,613
Jake, I need some
T-to-the-fourth-power-Y.

122
00:09:37,885 --> 00:09:40,786
Some time to talk to you.

123
00:09:43,157 --> 00:09:44,317
God.

124
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,724
It made sense to me, Priscilla.

125
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:53,797
You're leaving me for this guy?

126
00:09:54,001 --> 00:09:57,664
I'm sorry, Jake.
We met over spring break.

127
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:03,639
I'm not ordinary.

128
00:10:03,844 --> 00:10:06,335
You're leaving me for this guy?

129
00:10:06,547 --> 00:10:08,572
His name is Les...

130
00:10:08,782 --> 00:10:13,378
...and he's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

131
00:10:15,356 --> 00:10:18,086
And so is his bag.

132
00:10:47,388 --> 00:10:52,348
Janey Briggs,
please report to the office.

133
00:10:55,596 --> 00:10:58,565
Being a foreign exchange student
is scary...

134
00:10:58,766 --> 00:11:01,530
...adjusting to a new school,
a new country.

135
00:11:01,735 --> 00:11:05,432
But you'll find that the students
are very accepting.

136
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:10,372
-I am so happy to be in America.
-You have a sunny disposition.

137
00:11:12,613 --> 00:11:15,480
-You got your schedule?
-I don't need it.

138
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:18,511
I come to school to be
object of lust...

139
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:22,780
...for poor nerds who cannot get
American pussy.

140
00:11:23,257 --> 00:11:25,521
Well, isn't that wonderful?

141
00:11:26,093 --> 00:11:27,082
Janey, come in.

142
00:11:27,628 --> 00:11:30,791
This is Areola,
our foreign exchange student.

143
00:11:30,998 --> 00:11:33,933
Janey will show you
to your first class.

144
00:11:35,169 --> 00:11:36,534
Hi.

145
00:11:42,643 --> 00:11:45,407
-I like your backpack.
-Grazie.

146
00:11:49,817 --> 00:11:54,550
Dude, I heard there's an undercover
reporter posing as a student.

147
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,814
Dude, no way, dude.

148
00:11:57,024 --> 00:12:00,391
Do you know where
Mr. Keller's English class is?

149
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:03,927
-Down the hall, on your left.
-Sweet, dude.

150
00:12:04,665 --> 00:12:08,567
For the thousandth time, I said,
"Swallow that thing."

151
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:10,566
Am I right?

152
00:12:14,842 --> 00:12:18,141
How could Priscilla dump me,
Jake Wyler?

153
00:12:18,345 --> 00:12:20,313
Who does she think she is?

154
00:12:20,514 --> 00:12:22,778
I got two words for you, Jake:

155
00:12:23,017 --> 00:12:26,544
Prom queen, material.

156
00:12:27,388 --> 00:12:29,652
Austin, she's an illusion.

157
00:12:29,857 --> 00:12:33,156
You take away the makeup,
the clothes...

158
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,262
...the way she wears her hair,
the smell of her perfume...

159
00:12:37,464 --> 00:12:41,594
...that cute face she makes
when she's tonguing my balls....

160
00:12:43,704 --> 00:12:45,331
Look, she's replaceable.

161
00:12:45,539 --> 00:12:48,667
Given the right look,
the right boyfriend...

162
00:12:48,876 --> 00:12:52,334
-...any girl could be prom queen.
-I smell a bet.

163
00:12:52,546 --> 00:12:55,208
Jakey, Jakey,
about to make a big...

164
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:57,577
...mistakey.

165
00:12:57,785 --> 00:13:01,277
I'll pick the most
hopeless girl at this school...

166
00:13:01,488 --> 00:13:05,117
...and I'll bet that you
can't turn her into prom queen.

167
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,953
You're on, Austin.

168
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,129
I'll bet you lose that bet...

169
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,891
...but learn a much more
valuable lesson, and win.

170
00:13:13,133 --> 00:13:15,067
In life, that is.

171
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,493
You're both on.

172
00:13:17,705 --> 00:13:19,104
All right.

173
00:13:19,306 --> 00:13:23,936
Let's find you a prom queen,
Mr. Let's-Find-Me-A-Prom-Queen.

174
00:13:24,912 --> 00:13:26,038
What about her?

175
00:13:26,246 --> 00:13:28,305
Baby's got back.
Hunch, that is.

176
00:13:28,515 --> 00:13:31,075
No, way too easy.

177
00:13:31,719 --> 00:13:35,746
-I have no pigment
-Any girl with a guitar is hot.

178
00:13:35,956 --> 00:13:37,583
I need sunscreen

179
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:41,022
Even a hippie albino.
She could be prom queen.

180
00:13:41,228 --> 00:13:43,389
What about the Fratelli sisters?

181
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,966
So they're slightly disfigured
and connected.

182
00:13:47,167 --> 00:13:51,103
But combined, those two make up
one pretty decent chick.

183
00:13:51,305 --> 00:13:53,466
-I'd do them!
-I know, Reggie Ray.

184
00:13:53,674 --> 00:13:57,007
I'm looking for somebody
really messed up.

185
00:13:57,211 --> 00:14:01,079
I'm talking about a real shitbomb.

186
00:14:04,318 --> 00:14:07,719
Well, bombs away.

187
00:14:08,322 --> 00:14:12,816
No, no, no, anyone but her!
Not Janey Briggs.

188
00:14:13,527 --> 00:14:16,621
Guys, she's got glasses
and a ponytail.

189
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:20,095
She's got paint on her overalls!
What is that?

190
00:14:20,768 --> 00:14:23,703
There's no way
she could be prom queen.

191
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:26,372
Damn, that shit's whack.

192
00:14:27,775 --> 00:14:29,470
Aim for the head!

193
00:14:43,657 --> 00:14:46,626
Can you imagine
what they do in there?

194
00:14:46,827 --> 00:14:48,317
Holy cow.

195
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:51,862
Guys, get your heads
out of the gutter.

196
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:55,159
It's a locker room.
It's no sexier in there...

197
00:14:55,369 --> 00:14:57,030
...than it is in here.

198
00:14:57,271 --> 00:15:00,536
Molly, can you help me
take off my panties?

199
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:03,972
Hold on, I've got lotion
on my hands.

200
00:15:04,178 --> 00:15:07,272
That's okay.
You can just use your mouth.

201
00:15:15,522 --> 00:15:17,046
Thanks, Miss Peters.

202
00:15:17,758 --> 00:15:18,782
So...

203
00:15:18,992 --> 00:15:22,860
...who would like to share their poem
with the class?

204
00:15:25,165 --> 00:15:28,191
Mr. Keller? Over here.
Right here. Please.

205
00:15:28,402 --> 00:15:29,426
Anyone?

206
00:15:29,636 --> 00:15:32,002
Please pick me.
I'm the one.

207
00:15:32,206 --> 00:15:33,366
Yes...

208
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:35,531
...Ricky.

209
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:47,613
-"Ten Things I Love About Janey."
-Oh, not again.

210
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:49,288
By Ricky Lipman.

211
00:15:50,557 --> 00:15:55,290
I love it when Janey talks
I love it when Janey walks

212
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:59,660
I love it when Janey drinks
I love it when Janey blinks

213
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,868
I love it when Janey says hi

214
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:06,972
I love it when Janey says
See you in English

215
00:16:10,577 --> 00:16:13,637
I love following Janey to the mall

216
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:18,712
And I love...

217
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:23,379
...collecting strands
ofJaney's hair...

218
00:16:23,657 --> 00:16:29,653
...and rolling them up
lnto little Janey hairballs

219
00:16:40,774 --> 00:16:45,575
Thank you, Ricky,
for that interesting poem.

220
00:16:47,114 --> 00:16:51,574
-I'm not sure we should be doing this.
-Quiet. I hear them.

221
00:16:51,785 --> 00:16:54,618
I can't believe
what we just did, Molly.

222
00:16:54,821 --> 00:16:59,622
It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience
that will never happen again.

223
00:16:59,826 --> 00:17:03,125
Shit, we missed it.
Let's keep going.

224
00:17:04,131 --> 00:17:07,157
Hey, I found a buffalo nickel!

225
00:17:13,106 --> 00:17:14,095
Jackpot.

226
00:17:14,474 --> 00:17:17,637
Girl go pee-pee
not what I want to see-see.

227
00:17:17,844 --> 00:17:18,970
I agree-gree.

228
00:17:19,179 --> 00:17:23,047
Would you two please try and be
a little open-minded?

229
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:28,952
Class, let's open our books
and continue with our poetry lesson.

230
00:17:29,156 --> 00:17:32,125
You know what I think about poetry?

231
00:17:34,695 --> 00:17:37,892
Oh, is that amusing?

232
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:41,663
Is that what your generation
considers humor?

233
00:17:49,376 --> 00:17:52,709
This make me kind of happy in pants.

234
00:17:58,619 --> 00:17:59,984
Goodness.

235
00:18:00,187 --> 00:18:03,384
That make me kind of sad in pants.

236
00:18:04,191 --> 00:18:07,922
Shakespeare, Moliére...

237
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:10,028
...Oscar Wilde.

238
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,925
These were humorists.

239
00:18:14,668 --> 00:18:15,862
I'm gonna be sick.

240
00:18:16,069 --> 00:18:20,529
The sublime poetic genius
of a clever turn of phrase.

241
00:18:20,741 --> 00:18:22,675
That is true comedy.

242
00:18:23,443 --> 00:18:24,842
Heavens to Betsy.

243
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:32,443
Your modern, moronic, feeble-minded,
sophomoric excuse for wit...

244
00:18:35,122 --> 00:18:37,590
...is merely a parade of nasty...

245
00:18:39,026 --> 00:18:41,085
...filthy, vulgar...

246
00:18:42,429 --> 00:18:45,023
...human excrement!

247
00:18:58,979 --> 00:19:00,446
Excuse me.

248
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,152
-Hey, Janey. What's up?
-Excuse me?

249
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:20,129
Ever want to be
the most popular girl in school?

250
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,358
Anorexic, superficial?

251
00:19:22,569 --> 00:19:26,061
A whore who lacks any real
long-term goals?

252
00:19:26,273 --> 00:19:27,797
Exactly.

253
00:19:28,008 --> 00:19:31,739
If you're interested,
I thought we could go out sometime.

254
00:19:31,945 --> 00:19:33,276
Be seen in public.

255
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:37,746
-We haven't spoken in four years.
-Actually, more like six.

256
00:19:38,151 --> 00:19:41,382
That time when we were
in line at that theater...

257
00:19:41,588 --> 00:19:45,718
...l was actually saying "hey"
to the person behind you.

258
00:19:52,332 --> 00:19:56,063
Friday's championship game
is against North Compton...

259
00:19:56,269 --> 00:19:59,067
...and that squad always tries
to bring it.

260
00:19:59,272 --> 00:20:01,763
-Bring what, Priscilla?
-Bring it.

261
00:20:01,975 --> 00:20:04,535
Right, but what is "it"?

262
00:20:04,878 --> 00:20:08,336
It's just what they bring, okay?

263
00:20:19,659 --> 00:20:21,559
New girl.

264
00:20:22,395 --> 00:20:27,992
I'm Sandy Sue.
It is simply swell to meet all of you.

265
00:20:28,201 --> 00:20:30,499
Peachy.
You brought a routine?

266
00:20:30,704 --> 00:20:33,070
Oh, you bet.

267
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,006
Give me an H.
Give me a U.

268
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:41,540
Give me a giant pussy-licking,
ass-fucker cock shit!

269
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:48,311
I'm sorry.
That was my Tourette's.

270
00:20:49,156 --> 00:20:52,148
I don't know about her.

271
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:55,886
Let's get it straight.
This isn't a cheerocracy.

272
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:57,627
I am the cheertator.

273
00:20:57,831 --> 00:21:02,564
I make the cheercisions,
I will deal with the cheeronsequences.

274
00:21:02,769 --> 00:21:06,603
If there are no more cheeruptions,
we can cheertinue.

275
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,932
Thank you.

276
00:21:12,579 --> 00:21:15,548
Grandpa stuck a finger in my ass!
Cum face!

277
00:21:17,584 --> 00:21:20,348
She'll cheer do.
Great.

278
00:21:21,855 --> 00:21:24,653
Goddamn it, let's go now!
Thirty-two draw!

279
00:21:24,858 --> 00:21:28,294
Goddamn it!
Let's show some goddamn hustle!

280
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:32,090
Look alive out there!
This isn't a goddamn tryout!

281
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:34,665
-Goddamn it!
-Blue 21 ! Hut!

282
00:21:34,868 --> 00:21:36,358
What the hell?

283
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:39,038
Nobody's covering that hole!

284
00:21:39,239 --> 00:21:42,106
Goddamn it!
Let's do it again!

285
00:21:43,476 --> 00:21:46,411
Marty! Marty! Marty!

286
00:21:47,147 --> 00:21:49,411
All right, Marty.

287
00:21:51,451 --> 00:21:53,942
-Get your ass in there.
-You sure?

288
00:21:54,154 --> 00:21:56,554
Just go, goddamn it.

289
00:21:56,756 --> 00:21:58,986
Wyler, we got this wrapped up.

290
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:03,219
All you gotta do is run out the clock.

291
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:08,099
For God's sakes,
don't try anything fancy!

292
00:22:08,301 --> 00:22:09,825
Goddamn it.

293
00:22:12,672 --> 00:22:14,435
Listen, boys.

294
00:22:14,641 --> 00:22:17,109
We got time for one more play.

295
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:20,609
-I say we get the ball to Marty.
-Damn.

296
00:22:20,814 --> 00:22:23,612
No, I'm just happy
being on the field.

297
00:22:23,817 --> 00:22:28,277
Coach reckons we should take a knee.
We're up 42 - 0.

298
00:22:28,488 --> 00:22:30,649
I don't care what coach reckons.

299
00:22:30,857 --> 00:22:33,417
You can't go through life
being scared.

300
00:22:33,627 --> 00:22:36,994
If you do, you'll always wonder,
"What if?"

301
00:22:37,664 --> 00:22:41,430
But if you go out there
and you give it your all...

302
00:22:41,801 --> 00:22:43,496
...that's heroic.

303
00:22:45,972 --> 00:22:47,963
Guys, I appreciate this, but--

304
00:22:48,174 --> 00:22:50,506
That's the spirit! Ready?

305
00:22:56,082 --> 00:22:58,778
What are you doing?
Get out of here.

306
00:22:58,985 --> 00:23:00,612
Not here. Down there.

307
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:01,912
Over here?

308
00:23:02,122 --> 00:23:04,181
What are you doing?
Over here!

309
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:05,850
Here?

310
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,359
We love you, Marty!

311
00:23:08,561 --> 00:23:10,188
Set, hut!

312
00:23:21,007 --> 00:23:22,804
No. No.

313
00:23:24,144 --> 00:23:26,339
No, don't throw it to me.

314
00:23:27,013 --> 00:23:28,378
No!

315
00:23:54,407 --> 00:23:57,934
-Nice hands, Marty!
-I did it.

316
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,780
-I'm a hero!
-Walk it off!

317
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:05,677
All right, goddamn it!
Hit the showers, goddamn it!

318
00:24:06,219 --> 00:24:09,211
Bunch of candy-asses.
Lousy practice!

319
00:24:09,422 --> 00:24:12,152
We'll get our asses kicked Friday!

320
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:15,692
What about fourth-string?
I didn't get to practice.

321
00:24:15,895 --> 00:24:19,763
After all the shenanigans
you pulled last season...

322
00:24:19,966 --> 00:24:24,801
...thank God you're still
in goddamn uniform, goddamn it!

323
00:24:48,795 --> 00:24:53,061
If my parents hear I got detention,
no dessert for a week.

324
00:24:53,266 --> 00:24:57,362
We've disgraced ourselves
and our families.

325
00:24:57,570 --> 00:25:01,597
I sense the morale's a little low.
I say we make a pact...

326
00:25:02,242 --> 00:25:04,039
...right here, right now.

327
00:25:04,244 --> 00:25:07,441
Before the end of the year,
we all get laid!

328
00:25:08,081 --> 00:25:09,946
We always make that pact.

329
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:13,051
We've been waiting for this
since puberty.

330
00:25:13,253 --> 00:25:16,620
-Two weeks ago!
-I just got first hair on ball.

331
00:25:17,257 --> 00:25:19,748
I don't think you understand.

332
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:23,627
We'll become the masters of our
sexual destiny.

333
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:27,630
No longer will our penises remain
flaccid and unused.

334
00:25:27,834 --> 00:25:30,325
No longer steal Grandfather's porn.

335
00:25:30,537 --> 00:25:34,633
No longer will we use blindfolds
when we jerk each other off.

336
00:25:35,375 --> 00:25:37,002
All right, that's it.

337
00:25:41,114 --> 00:25:43,207
What in God's name is going on?

338
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:46,078
-What was that ruckus?
-I no hear ruckus.

339
00:25:46,286 --> 00:25:50,450
-I heard a ruckus.
-Can you describe this ruckus, sir?

340
00:25:50,657 --> 00:25:53,421
You better watch your tongue,
young man!

341
00:25:53,626 --> 00:25:55,491
We were just sitting here.

342
00:25:55,695 --> 00:25:58,755
You just bought yourself
another detention.

343
00:25:58,965 --> 00:26:01,798
-That's not fair.
-Cry me a river, dickface.

344
00:26:02,001 --> 00:26:04,868
-You bought another one.
-Eat my shorts.

345
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:06,769
What was that?

346
00:26:06,973 --> 00:26:10,170
Eat my shorts!

347
00:26:10,376 --> 00:26:13,174
-Don't mess with a bull.
-I'm shaking.

348
00:26:13,379 --> 00:26:15,006
-You got another.
-Good!

349
00:26:15,215 --> 00:26:17,843
-You through?
-Not even close, bud.

350
00:26:18,051 --> 00:26:19,814
-Want another one?
-Yes.

351
00:26:20,019 --> 00:26:22,044
-You got it!
-Good.

352
00:26:22,255 --> 00:26:24,223
-Another one. Had enough?
-No.

353
00:26:24,424 --> 00:26:25,652
-Another one.
-So?

354
00:26:25,859 --> 00:26:27,827
-I can keep going.
-Go!

355
00:26:28,027 --> 00:26:30,222
-Eenie, meenie, minie--
-Moe.

356
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:31,658
-Your mom's a--
-Ho.

357
00:26:31,865 --> 00:26:33,560
-He's a famous clown.
-Bobo.

358
00:26:33,766 --> 00:26:36,064
Mitch, cut it out.

359
00:26:38,238 --> 00:26:40,206
-Another one.
-But I was--

360
00:26:40,406 --> 00:26:41,737
That's another one!

361
00:26:41,941 --> 00:26:44,705
-One more for Ox or for Mitch?
-Another.

362
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:47,639
-I confused.
-Shut up, Wang Chung.

363
00:26:47,847 --> 00:26:51,783
I got you for the rest of your lives.
You're mine.

364
00:26:52,185 --> 00:26:55,780
Next time, I'm cracking skulls.

365
00:27:10,403 --> 00:27:14,203
How many times have I said
I'm not going to Princeton?

366
00:27:14,407 --> 00:27:16,307
I'm not pressuring you.

367
00:27:16,709 --> 00:27:18,404
Just give it four years.

368
00:27:18,611 --> 00:27:21,944
If you don't like it,
you can work at my firm.

369
00:27:22,148 --> 00:27:24,946
I don't want your life!

370
00:27:25,718 --> 00:27:26,810
That's okay, son.

371
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,818
I heard about what happened
with Priscilla.

372
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,285
The good news is...

373
00:27:31,491 --> 00:27:34,051
...l've got the perfect rebound girl.

374
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,557
Really?

375
00:27:36,896 --> 00:27:39,626
Beverly! Could you come in here?

376
00:27:45,905 --> 00:27:46,997
That's Mom!

377
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,265
What do you say, kiddo?

378
00:27:49,976 --> 00:27:52,342
I'm gonna leave you two alone.

379
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:57,015
Make me proud, son.

380
00:27:57,684 --> 00:27:59,811
So, you in love?

381
00:28:02,355 --> 00:28:06,155
-Yeah, I think I am.
-Well, who is this guy?

382
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:10,318
His name is Blane. He's a senior.
He's so beautiful.

383
00:28:16,035 --> 00:28:19,436
Janey? Sweetheart?

384
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:23,205
Hi, Daddy.

385
00:28:23,409 --> 00:28:26,640
Is something wrong?
You were quiet at dinner.

386
00:28:26,846 --> 00:28:29,542
You were passed out on the table.

387
00:28:34,988 --> 00:28:36,421
Listen, honey...

388
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:41,017
...l may not always be coherent
or conscious...

389
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:45,391
...but I know when my girl's
got something on her mind.

390
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:49,091
Well, there is this popular boy,
Jake.

391
00:28:49,302 --> 00:28:52,965
Oh, sweetie.

392
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,708
Jake knocked you up, didn't he?

393
00:28:56,909 --> 00:28:59,343
No, he asked me out.

394
00:29:00,546 --> 00:29:03,640
Do you like him?
Are you attracted to him?

395
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:06,641
I mean, would you give him head?

396
00:29:06,853 --> 00:29:09,720
He is kind of cute, but...

397
00:29:09,922 --> 00:29:12,288
...he's always been a total jerk.

398
00:29:12,492 --> 00:29:15,017
It's weird that he's
talking to me now.

399
00:29:15,228 --> 00:29:20,063
Especially after you've packed on a
couple of pounds.

400
00:29:23,202 --> 00:29:25,727
What do you think I should do?

401
00:29:25,938 --> 00:29:27,599
Look, sweetie.

402
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:32,335
I never want you to do anything
that compromises who you are...

403
00:29:32,545 --> 00:29:35,912
...because you're very,
very special to me.

404
00:29:36,115 --> 00:29:40,074
If Jake is only asking you out
to get into your pants...

405
00:29:40,586 --> 00:29:42,713
...well, then I'd say...

406
00:29:42,922 --> 00:29:44,617
...go out with him.

407
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:48,419
You could certainly use
the popularity points.

408
00:29:48,795 --> 00:29:50,626
And if Jake likes you...

409
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:55,995
...then maybe those kids'll quit
throwing bags of shit on the porch.

410
00:30:01,507 --> 00:30:03,202
I feel better.

411
00:30:05,778 --> 00:30:08,508
Thanks for the advice, Daddy.

412
00:30:09,415 --> 00:30:12,714
That's what I'm here for,
pumpkin-tits.

413
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:22,820
-I need to ask you a favor.
-It's about time.

414
00:30:23,262 --> 00:30:25,321
No, not that.

415
00:30:27,066 --> 00:30:30,035
You're the cruelest girl
in high school.

416
00:30:30,236 --> 00:30:34,434
You're the only one who can help
trick Janey into liking me.

417
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,201
That girl with the glasses
and the ponytail?

418
00:30:38,411 --> 00:30:41,346
Don't forget the
paint-covered overalls.

419
00:30:42,548 --> 00:30:45,016
Well...

420
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,778
...it's going to be difficult.

421
00:30:48,521 --> 00:30:50,819
But I think I can help you.

422
00:30:51,023 --> 00:30:52,490
Sit.

423
00:30:55,695 --> 00:30:57,356
For a price.

424
00:30:59,532 --> 00:31:02,729
And this time,
I don't want your car.

425
00:31:04,437 --> 00:31:06,132
I want you.

426
00:31:06,439 --> 00:31:10,000
Catherine, that's disgusting.
You're my sister.

427
00:31:10,209 --> 00:31:12,734
Only by blood.

428
00:31:12,945 --> 00:31:18,440
-What is wrong with this family?
-Hey, do you want my help or not?

429
00:31:31,297 --> 00:31:34,198
There are three things
you need to do...

430
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:38,200
...to have Janey
eating out of your hand.

431
00:31:38,404 --> 00:31:40,338
First, you earn her trust.

432
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,599
Come on, leave him alone!

433
00:31:42,809 --> 00:31:46,836
Hey! Come on, guys, back off.
That's enough, okay?

434
00:31:50,349 --> 00:31:51,976
You little shit.

435
00:32:03,596 --> 00:32:06,258
Don't you guys mess with him again.

436
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:11,301
Once you've got her trust,
it's time to make her feel special.

437
00:32:11,938 --> 00:32:15,567
Pick a song with hername in it.
That always works.

438
00:32:38,598 --> 00:32:41,465
She's got a gun!
Janey's got a gun!

439
00:32:52,411 --> 00:32:53,639
Take it easy, miss.

440
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:55,336
-Wait.
-Get back here!

441
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,216
Hold her down.

442
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:07,155
Give me your hand!
Just give us the gun, Janey.

443
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:11,258
Afteryou've made her feel special...

444
00:33:11,464 --> 00:33:14,456
...it's time to put the icing
on the cake.

445
00:33:14,667 --> 00:33:17,261
I'm really glad you showed up, Janey.

446
00:33:17,503 --> 00:33:22,304
The only reason I came here
was to tell you to leave me alone.

447
00:33:22,508 --> 00:33:25,534
You know, I was just making a snack.

448
00:33:25,745 --> 00:33:27,508
You want one?

449
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:30,114
No. Listen, Jake--

450
00:33:30,316 --> 00:33:32,045
I'll be right back.

451
00:34:09,388 --> 00:34:11,652
Hungry?

452
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:15,416
I don't like sundaes.

453
00:34:15,628 --> 00:34:19,997
It's not a sundae,
it's a banana split.

454
00:34:21,734 --> 00:34:25,226
I don't like those, either.
Goodbye, Jake.

455
00:34:40,486 --> 00:34:43,455
I left some money
on the kitchen counter.

456
00:34:43,656 --> 00:34:46,090
Emergency numbers are by the phone.

457
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:48,783
And remember, son:
No parties.

458
00:34:48,995 --> 00:34:50,257
I know, Dad.

459
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,359
Keg coming through.
Hey.

460
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:54,394
What's up, man?

461
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,625
We're trusting you, Preston.

462
00:34:56,836 --> 00:35:01,102
-Where do you want the speakers?
-In the dining room.

463
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:03,537
You guys should hit the road.

464
00:35:03,743 --> 00:35:06,371
I'm taking your Ferrari
to buy hookers.

465
00:35:06,579 --> 00:35:09,139
We'll call you later to check in.

466
00:35:09,348 --> 00:35:12,749
I'll be so high,
I won't know where the phone is.

467
00:35:12,952 --> 00:35:14,419
That's my boy.

468
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:20,020
Jake, what are you doing here?

469
00:35:20,226 --> 00:35:22,888
I'm taking you to Preston's big party.

470
00:35:23,462 --> 00:35:24,520
I can't.

471
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:28,962
I'm not dressed to go to a party.
I'm a complete mess.

472
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:32,763
I'd say you're one big fucking
train wreck.

473
00:35:36,842 --> 00:35:38,366
Do I know you?

474
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:57,787
That's it. I've got it.

475
00:35:57,997 --> 00:35:59,191
What?

476
00:35:59,398 --> 00:36:03,425
It might seem crazy,
but you'll have to trust me.

477
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,061
That's it.

478
00:36:33,265 --> 00:36:36,098
I did it. I'm a miracle-worker.

479
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:40,663
Gentlemen...

480
00:36:40,873 --> 00:36:43,967
...may I present to you
the new and improved...

481
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:46,705
...Janey Briggs.

482
00:37:21,413 --> 00:37:25,577
Congratulations. You just got
your first slow-motion entrance.

483
00:37:47,973 --> 00:37:50,100
I'm okay!

484
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:51,571
Janey?

485
00:37:53,546 --> 00:37:57,243
Come on out of there, honey.
Quit farting around.

486
00:38:06,058 --> 00:38:08,993
-Got your mom's car keys?
-Check.

487
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:12,755
-Sleeping bags.
-Check.

488
00:38:12,965 --> 00:38:13,989
-Condoms.
-Check.

489
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:19,365
Three pubescent libidos to take us
on a series of wild adventures.

490
00:38:19,572 --> 00:38:21,870
Check! Road trip!

491
00:38:37,323 --> 00:38:38,483
We here.

492
00:38:38,991 --> 00:38:42,984
Gentlemen, tonight we go to our
first high-school party.

493
00:38:43,562 --> 00:38:46,827
This is the place to buzz the Brillo.

494
00:38:47,032 --> 00:38:49,091
How you plan on buzzing Brillo?

495
00:38:49,935 --> 00:38:54,133
With this letter.
Amanda Becker will know the truth:

496
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:57,070
I've loved her since I first saw her.

497
00:38:58,244 --> 00:38:59,643
Welcome to the party.

498
00:38:59,845 --> 00:39:04,145
If you're going to have sex,
do it in my parents' bedroom.

499
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:09,620
-Does she go to our school?
-It's not even the same person.

500
00:39:09,822 --> 00:39:12,518
Janey-stainey-stained-pants-overalls?

501
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:14,955
How did you talk me into this?

502
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:19,859
Priscilla's freaking out
now that Janey's lost her ponytail.

503
00:39:20,065 --> 00:39:23,228
I'm going to go
fuck a complete stranger.

504
00:39:23,435 --> 00:39:26,563
Hey, I'm a complete stranger.

505
00:39:28,841 --> 00:39:32,368
Relax, all right?
It's going to be okay.

506
00:39:32,878 --> 00:39:33,936
Nice turtleneck.

507
00:39:34,146 --> 00:39:36,046
What's your name?

508
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:39,615
I'm Sandy Sue.
Limp-dick fag fucker!

509
00:39:39,818 --> 00:39:41,877
Who told you that?
Alison?

510
00:39:42,087 --> 00:39:44,851
Alison was bitter when we broke up.

511
00:39:45,057 --> 00:39:49,551
-Completely fake.
-Yeah, that's not her real hair color.

512
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:54,529
-She's wearing the same outfit as me.
-It looks much better on you.

513
00:39:54,733 --> 00:39:58,294
Where is she?
I thought she'd be here by now.

514
00:40:06,745 --> 00:40:08,372
What's going on?

515
00:40:09,648 --> 00:40:14,608
We can't talk
until she starts moving again.

516
00:40:19,558 --> 00:40:22,254
She took forever this time.

517
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:33,294
What are you doing here?

518
00:40:35,341 --> 00:40:36,501
What do you mean?

519
00:40:36,709 --> 00:40:41,043
I'm supposed to be the only black guy
at this party.

520
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:45,443
-Damn. Shit.
-Yeah, I know.

521
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:46,640
It's whack.

522
00:40:46,852 --> 00:40:47,944
My bad, man.

523
00:40:48,153 --> 00:40:49,950
-Take this.
-Thanks.

524
00:40:50,155 --> 00:40:51,520
Do your thing.

525
00:40:52,124 --> 00:40:55,685
-Peace out, brother.
-Honest mistake.

526
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:06,133
Hi, my name is Catherine.

527
00:41:06,805 --> 00:41:11,401
Yeah, I know.
We just had sex five minutes ago.

528
00:41:15,781 --> 00:41:17,976
Not scoring any cock, either?

529
00:41:18,183 --> 00:41:22,210
Cock? I've never even been kissed.

530
00:41:25,424 --> 00:41:30,054
What up, my yellow brothers?
Chinks in the house!

531
00:41:39,905 --> 00:41:44,035
Reggie Ray, have you
seen Janey anywhere?

532
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:47,877
It's a good night for smoking.

533
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,275
Ain't that right, Sausage?

534
00:41:57,956 --> 00:42:01,653
Okay, now close your eyes
and wet your lips.

535
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:05,455
-Are you for real?
-Do you want to learn or not?

536
00:42:06,965 --> 00:42:09,798
I guess.

537
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:25,248
-See? That wasn't so scary.
-It was nothing.

538
00:42:26,652 --> 00:42:28,984
Okay.

539
00:42:29,188 --> 00:42:31,713
Let's try again.

540
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:36,293
Only this time, I'm gonna
stick my tongue in your mouth.

541
00:42:36,495 --> 00:42:41,091
And when I do that, I want you
to massage my tongue with yours.

542
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:45,669
-And that's what first base is.
-Okay.

543
00:42:46,004 --> 00:42:47,665
Eyes closed.

544
00:43:13,065 --> 00:43:16,000
That was cool.

545
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:19,194
Now...

546
00:43:19,404 --> 00:43:22,805
...have you ever eaten pussy before?

547
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:28,145
You call this a party?!

548
00:43:28,347 --> 00:43:30,975
I'm a golden goddess!

549
00:43:31,183 --> 00:43:34,050
-Show us how drunk you are!
-Go for it!

550
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:42,687
You're a unique rebel, Janey!

551
00:43:43,462 --> 00:43:45,293
Janey, are you all right?

552
00:43:46,198 --> 00:43:51,329
-I told you not to let me drink.
-I gave you a nonalcoholic beer.

553
00:43:55,774 --> 00:43:58,572
What the hell are you doing here?

554
00:43:58,777 --> 00:43:59,937
I was invited.

555
00:44:00,145 --> 00:44:04,946
Look, you may have lost those glasses
and that ponytail thing...

556
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:08,142
...but you're still a loser.

557
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:17,056
Look at that. Oh, my God.

558
00:44:17,262 --> 00:44:19,492
That's going to stain.

559
00:44:24,603 --> 00:44:27,868
You're not going to cry now, are you?

560
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:14,079
Look, you can't just start
a slow clap at any old time.

561
00:45:14,286 --> 00:45:19,952
-You gotta wait for the right moment.
-When is it the right moment?

562
00:45:22,828 --> 00:45:24,989
You'll know.

563
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:39,270
Nobody's allowed down here.

564
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:41,503
Janey, I just thought--

565
00:45:41,713 --> 00:45:45,911
How did you get in here?
I deadbolted the door.

566
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:49,652
There's a hole in the side
of your house.

567
00:45:54,359 --> 00:45:56,486
Who's that?

568
00:45:56,695 --> 00:45:59,926
-It's my mother.
-You have her eyes.

569
00:46:02,234 --> 00:46:04,725
She died when I was 6.

570
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:07,871
I'm sorry.

571
00:46:08,073 --> 00:46:11,099
I remember it like it was yesterday.

572
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:16,839
Christmas, 1 989. Dad had been
fired from the zipper factory.

573
00:46:17,049 --> 00:46:20,109
Mom was pulling in tricks
to make ends meet.

574
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:23,720
Daniel Day-Lewis won an Oscar
for My Left Foot.

575
00:46:23,922 --> 00:46:27,255
And all I wanted was
a little Betsy Wetsy doll.

576
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:32,619
I remember those. Push her belly,
she'd piss all over herself.

577
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:36,892
She said she was going out
to get my dad a bottle of gin...

578
00:46:37,102 --> 00:46:40,868
...but I knew she was going
to get me that present.

579
00:46:41,073 --> 00:46:45,100
It was raining really hard
that night...

580
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:48,074
...and the roads were slippery.

581
00:46:48,547 --> 00:46:51,880
Oh, God, Janey.
A car accident.

582
00:46:52,084 --> 00:46:54,279
No. Cancer.

583
00:46:57,956 --> 00:47:01,517
I had to take on
all of her responsibilities:

584
00:47:01,727 --> 00:47:05,219
Cooking and cleaning and
breast-feeding Mitch.

585
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:08,627
It's in the past.
Think about your future.

586
00:47:08,834 --> 00:47:11,268
Look how talented you are.

587
00:47:11,470 --> 00:47:16,066
I have this dream ofjust
hopping on a plane and going to Paris.

588
00:47:16,274 --> 00:47:19,300
There's an art school
but I can't afford it.

589
00:47:19,811 --> 00:47:24,043
Unless I raise $26,000
before the admissions cutoff.

590
00:47:24,249 --> 00:47:29,653
My parents give a scholarship to girls
who can't get into art school.

591
00:47:29,921 --> 00:47:31,752
Really? That's amazing.

592
00:47:31,957 --> 00:47:36,291
This year we gave it to Lupe,
the Mexican finger painter.

593
00:47:36,495 --> 00:47:39,726
I think you'd really like her work.

594
00:47:40,165 --> 00:47:43,862
Sometimes I wish my life
was a fairy tale...

595
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:47,334
...and some guy would come
and take me away.

596
00:48:13,598 --> 00:48:17,625
-My eyes were shut.
-And we couldn't even--

597
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:30,638
-I'm going to go.
-Okay.

598
00:48:30,849 --> 00:48:35,218
Congratulations to the men
and women nominated forprom queen.

599
00:48:44,563 --> 00:48:48,556
Think you'll be prom queen?
Well, think again, Janey.

600
00:48:48,767 --> 00:48:52,635
You put the "ass" in "embarrassment."
The "boo" in "taboo."

601
00:48:52,838 --> 00:48:55,864
And the "suck" in "Iiposuction."

602
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:02,447
Is that the best you can do?

603
00:49:02,647 --> 00:49:04,376
No.

604
00:49:04,583 --> 00:49:07,484
You also put the "brat"
in "bratwurst."

605
00:49:07,953 --> 00:49:10,649
And the "eew" in "jujitsu."

606
00:49:10,856 --> 00:49:15,850
And the "ism" in "This is all
just a defense mechanism."

607
00:49:18,296 --> 00:49:22,960
So I told her, "Take the old lady and
send your mama back."

608
00:49:24,236 --> 00:49:28,935
So, you asked your four-eyed
circus freak to the prom yet?

609
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:31,233
We resent that!

610
00:49:32,611 --> 00:49:35,637
Why don't you just drop it, Austin?

611
00:49:35,881 --> 00:49:40,750
Jake made a few paint stains
in his pants thinking about Janey.

612
00:49:41,553 --> 00:49:44,545
It's just a bet. Okay, man?

613
00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:47,720
You always had a thing
for ugly girls...

614
00:49:47,926 --> 00:49:51,521
...Mr. I-Have-
a-Thing-For-Ugly-Girls.

615
00:49:53,899 --> 00:49:55,366
You mean Janey?

616
00:49:55,567 --> 00:49:59,162
She looks as good
as a dumpster full of gristles.

617
00:49:59,471 --> 00:50:01,939
Bling-bling.

618
00:50:03,475 --> 00:50:05,875
Janey Briggs...

619
00:50:06,077 --> 00:50:07,704
...is hot.

620
00:50:24,796 --> 00:50:27,629
-Hey, Janey.
-Hey, Jake.

621
00:50:27,832 --> 00:50:30,733
I've been doing a lot of thinking...

622
00:50:30,936 --> 00:50:35,737
...and there's something
I want to ask you.

623
00:50:35,941 --> 00:50:38,842
I don't want to make
a big deal of it...

624
00:50:39,044 --> 00:50:43,504
...so I'm just gonna lay it out there,
okay?

625
00:50:44,215 --> 00:50:46,183
Here it is.

626
00:50:48,286 --> 00:50:51,278
See, I don't like making big speeches.

627
00:50:51,489 --> 00:50:55,220
I'm a straight shooter.
I call them like I see them.

628
00:50:55,627 --> 00:50:57,618
What you see is what you get.

629
00:50:58,296 --> 00:51:03,393
Ain't nobody gonna break my stride.
Ain't nobody gonna slow me down.

630
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:06,935
Jake, are you trying
to ask me to the...?

631
00:51:07,138 --> 00:51:09,231
Yeah.

632
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:11,534
I'd love to go with you.

633
00:51:16,247 --> 00:51:18,647
Great. Great.

634
00:51:21,486 --> 00:51:24,148
I'll see you in English.

635
00:51:27,692 --> 00:51:30,422
It's time to play some football!

636
00:51:30,895 --> 00:51:35,923
The John Hughes Wasps take on
the North Compton Wildcats.

637
00:51:53,785 --> 00:51:55,412
Goddamn!

638
00:52:02,894 --> 00:52:05,920
That's the fastest half
of football ever.

639
00:52:10,835 --> 00:52:14,601
We saw you at our practice.
I know you stole our routine.

640
00:52:14,806 --> 00:52:19,573
I don't know what you mean.
We do our own cheers. Right, girls?

641
00:52:19,778 --> 00:52:20,767
That's right.

642
00:52:20,979 --> 00:52:24,073
Well then, you better bring it.

643
00:52:24,315 --> 00:52:26,613
Oh, it's already been broughten.

644
00:52:27,285 --> 00:52:29,617
Nice comeback, Priscilla! Yeah!

645
00:52:30,088 --> 00:52:33,114
We are the North Compton Wildcats

646
00:52:33,324 --> 00:52:34,985
We're black, we know it

647
00:52:35,193 --> 00:52:37,320
We shake ourbooty and show it

648
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:39,520
We ain't white
We ain't white

649
00:52:39,764 --> 00:52:42,927
We definitely ain't white
Break it down, nigga

650
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:51,573
Damn, those bitches represent!

651
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,688
-Reggie Ray.
-I smell a bet.

652
00:53:04,923 --> 00:53:06,151
You all right?

653
00:53:06,458 --> 00:53:09,518
Coach says it's okay
to bleed from the ears.

654
00:53:14,899 --> 00:53:17,959
I got to go back out on the field.

655
00:53:19,370 --> 00:53:22,362
All right. Be careful.
You only have three--

656
00:53:23,308 --> 00:53:26,766
Two concussions left. Reggie Ray.

657
00:53:26,978 --> 00:53:28,639
And we're back.

658
00:53:30,482 --> 00:53:32,382
Let's go, Wasps!

659
00:53:38,990 --> 00:53:40,753
Blue 33! Set!

660
00:53:42,861 --> 00:53:44,658
That's defense right there.

661
00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:48,057
Say "good day" to Reggie Ray.

662
00:53:50,568 --> 00:53:53,628
Sit down. He got the wind
knocked out of him.

663
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:56,467
Come on, Reggie Ray, get up!

664
00:53:57,442 --> 00:53:59,740
You still have another concussion!

665
00:54:02,947 --> 00:54:03,936
Come on, dog!

666
00:54:04,716 --> 00:54:07,048
It doesn't look good, coach.

667
00:54:07,252 --> 00:54:09,311
-Can he play?
-He's in a coma.

668
00:54:09,521 --> 00:54:12,615
Answer my question! Can he play?

669
00:54:12,891 --> 00:54:15,724
He can't breathe.
Get him to a hospital.

670
00:54:15,927 --> 00:54:17,053
Listen right now!

671
00:54:17,495 --> 00:54:22,831
I don't care what you have to do!
He stays in the game, goddamn it!

672
00:54:34,779 --> 00:54:37,680
Holy shit, this motherfucker's heavy.

673
00:54:38,183 --> 00:54:39,480
Blue 1 5!

674
00:54:42,287 --> 00:54:43,777
Set! Hut!

675
00:54:47,725 --> 00:54:49,852
Goddamn it, Reggie Ray!

676
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,194
Aw, shit.

677
00:55:11,416 --> 00:55:14,442
Wham, bam! What the fuck
just happened?

678
00:55:17,622 --> 00:55:22,992
Okay, Wyler, I've got no choice.
You're the only quarterback I've got.

679
00:55:23,761 --> 00:55:28,061
-I say give the ball to Marty.
-I'mjust happy being on the field.

680
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,460
-You'll always wonder, "What if?"
-I'm a hero!

681
00:55:35,373 --> 00:55:37,568
Goddamn it! Get in the game!

682
00:55:37,775 --> 00:55:39,402
You're our only chance!

683
00:55:40,812 --> 00:55:44,839
-You're a pussy, Wyler!
-Do it for Marty's torso!

684
00:55:48,486 --> 00:55:50,181
You got butterflies, huh?

685
00:55:50,555 --> 00:55:51,647
Who are you?

686
00:55:59,364 --> 00:56:00,922
I'm the wise janitor.

687
00:56:01,132 --> 00:56:04,295
I impart knowledge
and help overcome fears.

688
00:56:04,502 --> 00:56:06,697
I also replace the urinal cakes.

689
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:09,567
I'm here to help you
get your throw back.

690
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:12,399
-How did you--?
-I've been watching.

691
00:56:12,610 --> 00:56:17,172
During practice, in the hallways,
in the lockers, taking a shower...

692
00:56:17,382 --> 00:56:20,374
...whipping boys with a wet towel.

693
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:25,147
-Can tell you kind of like that.
-Hey! Let's get back to the throw.

694
00:56:25,356 --> 00:56:28,154
What happened to Marty
wasn't your fault.

695
00:56:28,359 --> 00:56:29,348
Really?

696
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:32,791
Okay, it was.
But you got to get over it.

697
00:56:33,097 --> 00:56:35,327
It could've happened to anybody.

698
00:56:35,533 --> 00:56:38,969
Anybody that disobeyed the coach
and the team...

699
00:56:39,170 --> 00:56:44,130
...and threw to a 90-pound kid
who shouldn't have been on the field.

700
00:56:44,375 --> 00:56:48,243
Stop! How is any of this
supposed to be helping me?

701
00:56:48,446 --> 00:56:50,505
Right. Forget what I said.

702
00:56:50,715 --> 00:56:55,379
You got to go out there, believe
in the ball and throw yourself.

703
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,979
You can do it.

704
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:04,993
I'm going out there.

705
00:57:11,069 --> 00:57:14,527
Only 25 seconds remaining,
and the season...

706
00:57:14,739 --> 00:57:19,039
...rests in the hands of fourth-string
quarterback Jake Wyler.

707
00:57:19,243 --> 00:57:22,337
Translation: We're shit out ofluck.

708
00:57:22,747 --> 00:57:24,112
Give me a W!

709
00:57:25,083 --> 00:57:27,176
Give me a Y!

710
00:57:27,418 --> 00:57:30,649
Give me a--
Lick my pussy ass cock shit!

711
00:57:31,456 --> 00:57:34,016
Lick my pussy ass cock shit!

712
00:57:38,363 --> 00:57:39,523
Blue 83!

713
00:57:42,433 --> 00:57:44,298
I reckon I'm feeling better.

714
00:57:44,502 --> 00:57:45,867
Set! Hut!

715
00:58:30,314 --> 00:58:31,474
Shit.

716
00:58:45,763 --> 00:58:50,257
That has to be the worst pass
I've ever seen, ever.

717
00:58:52,470 --> 00:58:54,438
What the hell was that?

718
00:59:31,509 --> 00:59:34,876
-You did great out there.
-I blew the game, Janey.

719
00:59:35,079 --> 00:59:36,512
I let everyone down.

720
00:59:36,714 --> 00:59:41,515
It's just a football game, Jake.
Besides...

721
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:44,620
...you didn't let me down.

722
00:59:45,189 --> 00:59:46,417
Really?

723
00:59:47,825 --> 00:59:50,555
Jake, you've taught me to be myself.

724
00:59:50,761 --> 00:59:53,787
You never saw me as the girl
in glasses.

725
00:59:53,998 --> 00:59:56,558
Don't forget the paint-covered
overalls.

726
00:59:56,767 --> 00:59:59,497
Right, you never noticed those either.

727
01:00:00,505 --> 01:00:02,996
You taught me a lot about myself too.

728
01:00:03,508 --> 01:00:07,706
Oh, Jake. Nothing could
ever come between us now.

729
01:00:07,912 --> 01:00:09,174
Jake Wyler.

730
01:00:10,948 --> 01:00:14,384
Congratulations.
You blew my perfect season.

731
01:00:14,585 --> 01:00:18,578
-SeòorYou-Blew-My-Perfect-Season.
-What do you want, Austin?

732
01:00:18,789 --> 01:00:19,778
A life.

733
01:00:21,559 --> 01:00:22,924
And payback.

734
01:00:23,361 --> 01:00:26,558
-Come on, don't do this.
-No, I'll hang around.

735
01:00:26,764 --> 01:00:31,701
Maybe tell Janey a little
S-E-C-R-A-T-P....

736
01:00:35,139 --> 01:00:36,868
What's going on?

737
01:00:38,943 --> 01:00:40,069
This isn't funny!

738
01:00:41,612 --> 01:00:42,601
No.

739
01:00:44,048 --> 01:00:45,276
I don't believe it.

740
01:00:45,483 --> 01:00:50,182
I said I'd turn you into prom queen
when I thought you were ugly...

741
01:00:50,388 --> 01:00:55,849
...the girl with no friends who was
dirt poor and smelled a little funky.

742
01:00:56,060 --> 01:00:58,494
Look, I made a mistake.

743
01:00:58,696 --> 01:01:02,894
If I could go back, I never would've
made that stupid bet.

744
01:01:06,103 --> 01:01:08,196
What bet?

745
01:01:11,175 --> 01:01:14,667
I never said anything about a bet.

746
01:01:24,589 --> 01:01:25,783
All I said was:

747
01:01:25,990 --> 01:01:27,890
"I'm pretending to whisper...

748
01:01:28,092 --> 01:01:33,189
...so Jake thinks I'm telling you a
secret, and will confess...

749
01:01:33,397 --> 01:01:38,858
...revealing a secret and confirming
everything I whispered in your ear."

750
01:02:04,795 --> 01:02:08,162
I wish I didn't make that bet

751
01:02:08,366 --> 01:02:11,995
That's not the guy I want to be

752
01:02:12,203 --> 01:02:15,661
Ifl couldjust turn back the clock

753
01:02:15,873 --> 01:02:20,810
Then Janey would still be with me

754
01:02:23,714 --> 01:02:26,842
Tell me, Mom, what should I do?

755
01:02:27,218 --> 01:02:28,708
I love this boy

756
01:02:28,919 --> 01:02:33,879
But he has been untrue

757
01:02:36,527 --> 01:02:39,655
I'll do my best to make things right

758
01:02:40,498 --> 01:02:44,161
I wish we could resolve this fight

759
01:02:45,002 --> 01:02:46,833
It could happen

760
01:02:47,038 --> 01:02:48,505
It could happen

761
01:02:48,706 --> 01:02:52,836
At the prom tonight

762
01:02:58,382 --> 01:03:01,351
I'm getting pussy no matter what

763
01:03:01,585 --> 01:03:04,349
Even ifit with dirty slut

764
01:03:04,555 --> 01:03:07,183
True love is what I want the most

765
01:03:07,391 --> 01:03:10,952
Ijustjerked offin yourFrench toast

766
01:03:11,529 --> 01:03:16,057
So what if we have the same mother

767
01:03:17,468 --> 01:03:22,565
Tonight I'm going to fuck my brother

768
01:03:22,973 --> 01:03:25,771
In a few hours
I'll be queen of the prom

769
01:03:28,779 --> 01:03:32,374
I've been an alcoholic
Since my first tourin Nam

770
01:03:34,719 --> 01:03:38,553
I asked Janey to the prom
And she doesn't know why

771
01:03:40,825 --> 01:03:44,488
I'm only in the song because
I'm a black guy

772
01:03:47,832 --> 01:03:52,667
I have no money
I have to make my own dress

773
01:03:54,472 --> 01:03:59,500
Look at me, my breasts are perky, yes

774
01:04:00,277 --> 01:04:03,269
I'm gonna win herback
No matter what it takes

775
01:04:03,481 --> 01:04:08,145
Here I go, I'm gonna forget about Jake

776
01:04:11,489 --> 01:04:13,354
Prom tonight

777
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:17,259
Prom tonight

778
01:04:18,763 --> 01:04:20,162
Prom tonight

779
01:04:25,603 --> 01:04:28,265
It's gonna happen, gonna happen

780
01:04:31,976 --> 01:04:36,436
At the prom

781
01:04:38,949 --> 01:04:39,973
Tonight

782
01:04:59,136 --> 01:05:05,132
When I was a freshman,
I threw 1 76 touchdown passes.

783
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:10,779
My sophomore year, I ran 14 in
on my own with a sprained ankle...

784
01:05:10,981 --> 01:05:15,315
...a broken phalange, a ruptured
duodenum and a subdermal hematoma.

785
01:05:32,436 --> 01:05:34,529
I bet she great bonk.

786
01:05:34,738 --> 01:05:38,139
Excuse me, Bruce? No.
You don't bonk Amanda Becker.

787
01:05:38,709 --> 01:05:42,509
You make sweet, sweet love to her.

788
01:05:43,180 --> 01:05:45,444
Amanda Becker's like a flower.

789
01:05:46,050 --> 01:05:47,574
You smell her.

790
01:05:47,785 --> 01:05:49,753
You touch her gently.

791
01:05:50,254 --> 01:05:54,782
You admire the beauty.
You watch it blossom.

792
01:05:55,526 --> 01:05:59,929
And you thank God he created
something so perfect.

793
01:06:02,633 --> 01:06:04,123
Go to her.

794
01:06:16,714 --> 01:06:18,739
Be strong, Mitch!

795
01:06:31,829 --> 01:06:34,593
What do you expect from me?

796
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:39,761
-Do you think I'll have sex with you?
-No! You don't understand.

797
01:06:39,970 --> 01:06:42,063
Because I am not a cheap slut.

798
01:06:42,273 --> 01:06:46,767
I don't screw every pathetic guy
that gives me a letter.

799
01:06:48,913 --> 01:06:51,541
I give them handjobs.

800
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:02,791
-Want to dance?
-Only if we're horizontal.

801
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:05,988
I totally heard that.

802
01:07:19,543 --> 01:07:21,374
We're dancing.

803
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:43,689
It's funny.

804
01:07:43,901 --> 01:07:47,962
You'd never suspect everyone
here is a professional dancer.

805
01:08:02,086 --> 01:08:03,451
Oh, God. No.

806
01:08:03,654 --> 01:08:06,418
I want to do it here
on the dance floor.

807
01:08:07,324 --> 01:08:11,124
Don't you forget our deal.
She wins, you're mine.

808
01:08:22,873 --> 01:08:27,003
And now the moment every popular guy
who's made a bet...

809
01:08:27,211 --> 01:08:31,807
...to turn a rebellious girl
into prom queen has been waiting for:

810
01:08:32,016 --> 01:08:35,349
The announcement
of the prom king and queen.

811
01:08:35,552 --> 01:08:38,077
This year's prom king is...

812
01:08:38,756 --> 01:08:39,780
Marty!

813
01:08:40,491 --> 01:08:42,823
...Jake Wyler!

814
01:08:57,141 --> 01:08:58,608
Way to go, Jake!

815
01:08:59,176 --> 01:09:02,043
This year's prom queen is....

816
01:09:02,246 --> 01:09:04,510
You got it, Priscilla!

817
01:09:04,715 --> 01:09:07,309
I don't believe it. It's a tie.

818
01:09:07,851 --> 01:09:08,840
A tie?

819
01:09:09,053 --> 01:09:10,714
-Holy shit!
-Oh, my God.

820
01:09:12,389 --> 01:09:14,687
Your new prom queens are...

821
01:09:16,126 --> 01:09:19,618
-...Kara and Sara Fratelli.
-Fuck.

822
01:09:20,664 --> 01:09:24,498
-Oh, my God!
-They deserve it.

823
01:09:26,904 --> 01:09:28,235
Congratulations!

824
01:09:30,507 --> 01:09:34,238
There we go! Your king and queen.

825
01:09:40,451 --> 01:09:43,614
I say we make like a tree
and branch...

826
01:09:44,588 --> 01:09:46,613
...out of here.

827
01:09:48,325 --> 01:09:49,952
All right, Kara and Sara.

828
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:53,596
Now, it is traditional
for the king and queen...

829
01:09:53,797 --> 01:09:57,426
-...to share a ceremonial dance.
-Come here.

830
01:10:07,778 --> 01:10:09,405
You smell good.

831
01:10:29,066 --> 01:10:31,261
Do you know where Austin went?

832
01:10:31,468 --> 01:10:35,495
I know he rented a room at
the Sunrise Motel. Room number six.

833
01:10:35,706 --> 01:10:39,870
Past the ice dispenser. Hit the
Pepsi machine, you went too far.

834
01:10:40,077 --> 01:10:42,568
Oh, and the door will not be locked.

835
01:10:45,149 --> 01:10:46,514
That's all I know.

836
01:10:47,751 --> 01:10:49,013
Thanks, Malik.

837
01:10:51,355 --> 01:10:56,258
You're intelligent and insightful.
You don't get the respect you deserve.

838
01:10:58,929 --> 01:11:01,227
You really mean that, Jake?

839
01:11:01,431 --> 01:11:04,628
That's great! I've always wanted
to discuss--

840
01:11:04,835 --> 01:11:07,235
I actually got to go. Sorry.

841
01:11:07,437 --> 01:11:08,529
Motherfucker.

842
01:11:08,739 --> 01:11:10,604
Hold it right there, mister.

843
01:11:11,108 --> 01:11:16,239
I am not going to let you hurt Janey
again, okay? Besides, I love her.

844
01:11:16,446 --> 01:11:17,606
Well, so do l.

845
01:11:18,549 --> 01:11:23,248
But I'm the best friend, and I've
been in front of her the whole time...

846
01:11:23,453 --> 01:11:27,514
...and she just doesn't realize
it yet, but she will.

847
01:11:28,091 --> 01:11:31,549
I'm the cool guy who's learned
the error of his ways.

848
01:11:31,962 --> 01:11:35,295
She'll forgive my mistakes
and realize I love her.

849
01:11:37,067 --> 01:11:38,625
Damn it. That's true.

850
01:11:53,550 --> 01:11:56,815
Why's this door locked?
It's a fire hazard!

851
01:12:12,069 --> 01:12:14,128
Get out of the road!

852
01:12:14,338 --> 01:12:15,805
Hey, watch it, man!

853
01:12:17,007 --> 01:12:19,237
She's not attracted to you!

854
01:12:19,810 --> 01:12:21,675
She doesn't love you!

855
01:12:22,679 --> 01:12:25,204
You'll never be more than a friend!

856
01:12:26,216 --> 01:12:28,377
Two dollars!

857
01:12:37,427 --> 01:12:39,622
Ice dispenser.

858
01:12:39,830 --> 01:12:41,229
Six.

859
01:12:41,665 --> 01:12:45,726
Yeah! I'll make you forget all
about losing prom queen.

860
01:12:45,936 --> 01:12:49,428
Tell me who your daddy is!
Tell me who your papa is!

861
01:12:51,942 --> 01:12:54,206
Get off her, man!

862
01:12:54,411 --> 01:12:55,571
Priscilla.

863
01:12:55,779 --> 01:12:57,246
Don't move.

864
01:13:02,085 --> 01:13:04,918
-What's going on?
-Something beautiful.

865
01:13:05,789 --> 01:13:09,020
-Where's Janey?
-Miss Run-Home-To-My-Daddy...

866
01:13:09,226 --> 01:13:11,990
...ran home to her daddy.

867
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:16,491
-That's for taking Janey to the prom.
-You put the--

868
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:21,535
-That's for hurting her at the party!
-This is really turning me on.

869
01:13:21,972 --> 01:13:24,839
That's for being really weird.

870
01:13:25,075 --> 01:13:26,565
Thank you.

871
01:13:32,115 --> 01:13:34,583
I don't know what that was for.

872
01:13:46,863 --> 01:13:49,832
I never thought I'd hear myself
say this...

873
01:13:50,701 --> 01:13:55,570
...but for once, I wish I could meet
a nice, sensitive guy...

874
01:13:56,173 --> 01:13:59,165
...who wanted more than just sex.

875
01:14:00,444 --> 01:14:03,174
That is very admirable.

876
01:14:06,049 --> 01:14:08,745
I wish a guy would
take me out for dinner.

877
01:14:09,353 --> 01:14:10,980
I feel the same way.

878
01:14:13,156 --> 01:14:14,919
And for once...

879
01:14:16,927 --> 01:14:21,159
...l wish a guy would take a dump
on my chest.

880
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:25,163
That is appalling.

881
01:14:29,606 --> 01:14:31,471
That really upsets me.

882
01:14:32,909 --> 01:14:37,005
I can't believe nobody's ever taken
a dump on your chest.

883
01:14:40,650 --> 01:14:42,174
Will you be that guy?

884
01:14:49,059 --> 01:14:52,586
It would be an honor and a privilege.

885
01:15:08,211 --> 01:15:09,303
Hello?

886
01:15:10,213 --> 01:15:12,078
Is anybody home?

887
01:15:12,616 --> 01:15:15,084
Get down! Enemy fire!

888
01:15:16,586 --> 01:15:18,281
Mr. Briggs?

889
01:15:18,488 --> 01:15:21,514
Excuse me, sir.
Do you know where Janey is?

890
01:15:21,725 --> 01:15:26,219
She went out there. On her own.
There's Charlie everywhere.

891
01:15:26,730 --> 01:15:29,096
Right. Do you know where she went?

892
01:15:29,466 --> 01:15:32,128
Couldn't take it. Went to the airport.

893
01:15:32,335 --> 01:15:37,068
Something about Paris.
Her tour was over.

894
01:15:37,340 --> 01:15:39,467
Paris. Thank you, sir.

895
01:15:40,010 --> 01:15:43,673
I need ammo! I can't hold them off
much longer!

896
01:15:49,653 --> 01:15:52,679
Off the road, you glasses
and ponytail freak!

897
01:16:05,769 --> 01:16:07,031
Two dollars!

898
01:16:07,471 --> 01:16:09,336
-Two dollars!
-Two dollars!

899
01:16:15,712 --> 01:16:17,839
Next stop, airport.

900
01:16:18,081 --> 01:16:22,677
The red zone is for the loading
and unloading ofpassengers.

901
01:16:22,886 --> 01:16:24,319
No parking.

902
01:16:24,521 --> 01:16:25,783
Attention, please.

903
01:16:25,989 --> 01:16:31,325
All red Porsche 944s parked in the
white zone will be towed immediately.

904
01:16:36,633 --> 01:16:40,160
Paris Air, flight 805 to art school
in Paris...

905
01:16:40,370 --> 01:16:42,634
...from gate 122, is now boarding.

906
01:16:56,253 --> 01:16:58,448
Excuse me, everyone!

907
01:16:59,055 --> 01:17:03,253
There's a girl boarding a plane
right now to Paris, that I love.

908
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:08,490
If I don't get there in time and
tell her how I feel...

909
01:17:08,698 --> 01:17:11,326
...l may never see her again.

910
01:17:15,238 --> 01:17:16,364
Go get her, son.

911
01:17:17,407 --> 01:17:18,772
Good luck, young man.

912
01:17:21,244 --> 01:17:22,939
-Go get her!
-Go for it.

913
01:17:25,582 --> 01:17:26,947
Oh, hell, just go.

914
01:17:29,753 --> 01:17:30,845
Freeze, bitch!

915
01:17:41,765 --> 01:17:44,256
You're bleeding on my suitcase.

916
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:51,529
Excuse me!

917
01:17:52,609 --> 01:17:54,042
Excuse me, everyone!

918
01:17:54,978 --> 01:18:00,314
There's a girl about to board a plane
to Paris right now that I love--

919
01:18:01,184 --> 01:18:03,880
We already heard that one. Asshole.

920
01:18:05,722 --> 01:18:10,682
This is the final call forParis Air
flight 805 to art school...

921
01:18:10,894 --> 01:18:13,158
...departing from gate 122.

922
01:18:16,066 --> 01:18:18,296
Hey, shithead, that's mine.

923
01:18:18,501 --> 01:18:19,798
Give it back!

924
01:18:20,303 --> 01:18:24,433
Just believe in the ball, Jake.
And throw yourself.

925
01:18:37,220 --> 01:18:38,653
Nice shot, Jake.

926
01:18:41,625 --> 01:18:43,991
Thank God I got to you in time.

927
01:18:45,161 --> 01:18:47,629
I'm not going to let you go to Paris.

928
01:18:48,398 --> 01:18:50,992
-This is the final call...
-Why not?

929
01:18:51,201 --> 01:18:53,396
...for flight 805 to art school.

930
01:18:53,603 --> 01:18:59,405
Ifyou're finding words to stop a girl
from leaving, now would be the time.

931
01:19:02,512 --> 01:19:06,243
I made that bet before I knew you.

932
01:19:07,684 --> 01:19:09,675
Before I really knew me.

933
01:19:11,755 --> 01:19:12,915
Oh, Jake.

934
01:19:15,058 --> 01:19:16,787
Okay, hold it right there.

935
01:19:21,064 --> 01:19:24,227
Tell me you didn't quote
Freddie Prinze Jr.

936
01:19:26,136 --> 01:19:29,936
I knew it. That was a line
from She's All That.

937
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:32,540
I masturbate to that movie.

938
01:19:36,012 --> 01:19:37,036
Do you mind?

939
01:19:37,247 --> 01:19:40,307
No, not at all.
Masturbation's very healthy.

940
01:19:44,020 --> 01:19:49,185
Janey, you said you couldn't believe
in someone that didn't believe in you.

941
01:19:49,392 --> 01:19:53,419
Well, I believed in you.
I always believed in you.

942
01:19:54,597 --> 01:19:55,586
Oh, Jake.

943
01:19:56,433 --> 01:20:00,267
Oh, God. I can't believe
you fell for that crap.

944
01:20:00,470 --> 01:20:03,166
-That's Pretty in Pink.
-Are you sure?

945
01:20:03,940 --> 01:20:04,929
Trust me.

946
01:20:05,141 --> 01:20:10,408
-Excuse me. What are you doing?
-Let me give you some advice, Jake.

947
01:20:10,613 --> 01:20:14,674
Lose the I'm-The-Cute-And-Sensitive
Popular-Boy routine.

948
01:20:14,884 --> 01:20:15,873
It's pathetic.

949
01:20:16,086 --> 01:20:19,453
And tell Janey
what's true in your heart.

950
01:20:19,656 --> 01:20:22,352
Stop being such a little bitch.

951
01:20:22,559 --> 01:20:27,929
And you. Miss Other-Side-Of-The-Tracks
Awkward-Rebel-With-Glasses.

952
01:20:28,131 --> 01:20:32,192
Wise up to Jake's bullshit.
Stop being such a dumb-ass.

953
01:20:35,905 --> 01:20:37,338
She's right.

954
01:20:38,007 --> 01:20:40,237
-Janey....
-Yes, Jake?

955
01:20:42,912 --> 01:20:46,439
Maybe you should get on that plane
and go to Paris.

956
01:20:47,851 --> 01:20:51,548
Well, if you stay,
we really only have the summer.

957
01:20:51,755 --> 01:20:56,055
Then I go to college. We'll spend
the occasional weekend together.

958
01:20:56,259 --> 01:20:57,487
Which is nice.

959
01:20:57,927 --> 01:21:02,728
But chances are, one night I'll get
wrecked and have sex with some girl.

960
01:21:02,932 --> 01:21:04,729
You'll call me a slut.

961
01:21:05,268 --> 01:21:08,237
I'll call you a cocktease
and we'll break up.

962
01:21:08,438 --> 01:21:12,169
So when you really think about it,
what's the point?

963
01:21:15,311 --> 01:21:20,408
Well, that wasn't exactly the kind
of truth I was expecting.

964
01:21:22,786 --> 01:21:27,416
But I'm not gonna fall for it.
How big a dumb-ass do you think I am?

965
01:21:27,624 --> 01:21:30,286
You obviously stole that
from Karate Kid.

966
01:21:31,060 --> 01:21:32,527
No, actually, l--

967
01:21:33,196 --> 01:21:35,460
Jake, it's okay.

968
01:21:36,199 --> 01:21:37,860
I love you too.

969
01:21:38,067 --> 01:21:40,194
We all know where this is going.

970
01:21:40,403 --> 01:21:42,428
Fucking teenagers.

971
01:21:52,048 --> 01:21:53,276
This is it.

972
01:21:53,483 --> 01:21:54,973
The right moment.

973
01:22:09,699 --> 01:22:11,530
Son of a bitch!

974
01:22:30,954 --> 01:22:32,080
Betty...

975
01:22:33,089 --> 01:22:34,920
...meet Apollonia.

976
01:22:35,391 --> 01:22:38,121
We're going to have a three-way.

977
01:28:41,090 --> 01:28:44,287
Sun's burned my cornea

978
01:28:44,493 --> 01:28:48,486
I can no longersee

979
01:28:48,698 --> 01:28:54,227
I'm not kidding
Somebodyplease fucking help me

980
01:28:57,106 --> 01:28:58,835
Quick! Grab her guitar.
