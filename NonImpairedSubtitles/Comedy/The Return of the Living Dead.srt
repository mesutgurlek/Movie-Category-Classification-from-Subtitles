1
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,659
Hey<i>,</i> Frank! Let's wrap it up and go home.

2
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:34,666
.What do you say?
.l got another hour's work to do.

3
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:37,236
The kid'll stay<i>,</i> and l'll show him the ropes.

4
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:39,168
Okay. Lock up for me before you go?

5
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:41,604
Fourth of July weekend<i>,</i> buddy boy.
Got to move.

6
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:45,974
Yeah. You have a nice Fourth<i>,</i>
and l'll see you Sunday at the barbecue.

7
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,639
You'd better believe it.
l'll be there with bells on.

8
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:51,876
Kid<i>,</i> l wanna tell you something<i>,</i>
and l mean this sincerely.

9
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:55,011
No matter what happens<i>,</i>
don't name it after me.

10
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:58,952
Take it easy<i>,</i> Frank.

11
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:01,821
That Burt's a joker.

12
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:04,590
.Freddy<i>,</i> follow me and learn something.
.Okay.

13
00:01:04,697 --> 00:01:07,962
We got an order here from
the St. Louis University Medical School.

14
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:11,162
They want two adult female skeletons
with perfect teeth.

15
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:13,466
That's a 2.AF.PT.

16
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,101
So you come over here to the ''A'' section.
That's ''A'' for adult<i>,</i> see?

17
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:20,372
Then that's divided up into two sections.

18
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,313
That's divided into the ''M'' for male
and the ''F'' for....

19
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:26,476
.Female.
.Good boy. Now the ''PT.''

20
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:29,521
Suppose you think that's ''pretty tough.''
But no<i>,</i> that's....

21
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:31,852
.Perfect teeth.
.Very good.

22
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:35,189
Now you get some excelsior over there
and lay it in that crate.

23
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:38,458
Make a nice little beddy.bye
for this little lady.

24
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:40,290
Okay.

25
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:43,726
Good work.
We want her to be comfortable.

26
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:45,828
Now help me get her in. Grab her legs.

27
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:47,438
Okay.

28
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:52,409
Now you get some of that
Styrofoam popcorn<i>,</i> spread it all around.

29
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:56,148
Don't be stingy.
Uncle Burt's paying for this.

30
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:58,884
More<i>,</i> Freddy. Okay<i>,</i> that's fine.

31
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:02,048
Now spread it around. That's right.

32
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:04,282
.You're doing very nice work.
.Thanks.

33
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,790
You'll be fine in the warehouse business.

34
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:09,953
.Where do we get all these skeletons?
.They come from lndia.

35
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:11,690
.lndia?
.lnternational treaty.

36
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,028
All skeletons come from lndia.

37
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,069
.No kidding. How come?
.How the hell do l know?

38
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:21,197
The important question is<i>,</i> where do they
get all the skeletons with perfect teeth?

39
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,332
l'm going to ask you a serious question.

40
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:25,502
How many people you know die...

41
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:28,945
...with a beautiful<i>,</i> perfect
set of choppers in their puss?

42
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:30,447
Nobody l can think of.

43
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,781
No. l think there's a skeleton farm
over in lndia.

44
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:36,110
Jesus!

45
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:38,986
Come on<i>,</i> kid. Follow your uncle here.

46
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:43,153
Here we go. l don't have to tell you
what these are for.

47
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:48,662
Here we've got the prosthetic devices<i>,</i>
all around here.

48
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:52,761
.Look under there. Wheelchairs.
.Right. These are great.

49
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:56,308
Here's something you don't see very often.
You're a privileged person.

50
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:59,936
These are split dogs
for veterinarian schools.

51
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:03,709
.We get a lot of orders for split dogs.
.That's really rad.

52
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,914
Don't fool around<i>,</i> you're learning.

53
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:09,849
Over here<i>,</i> Freddy<i>,</i>
is where we keep the fresh cadavers.

54
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:14,718
We sell these to medical schools
and to the US Army for ballistic tests.

55
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:22,625
Say hello.

56
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:33,805
We usually got more inventory than this...

57
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:36,905
...but we're expecting
a shipment on Monday.

58
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:41,285
How many bodies are in here usually?

59
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,446
You don't want to be overstocked.

60
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,387
Like the restaurant business...

61
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:48,927
...you don't want your inventory
to lose its freshness.

62
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:56,864
Tell you what l'll do<i>,</i> kid. Teach you
how to fill out these shipping forms.

63
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:59,438
Look alive.

64
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:07,179
.We gonna party tonight or what?
.We are gonna party.

65
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,078
.Where we gonna party?
.l don't know. Somewhere.

66
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:11,275
We can go to the park.

67
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:14,478
We can't. The cops will
shoot us if we go back to the park.

68
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:17,579
.l ain't in no mood to die tonight.
.l like death.

69
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:21,717
.l like death with sex. And you<i>,</i> Casey?
.Yeah<i>,</i> so fuck off and die.

70
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:23,318
When we gonna party tonight<i>,</i> Tina?

71
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:26,364
That'd be rad<i>,</i> but l have to meet Freddy
when he's done work.

72
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:29,697
.Where you supposed to meet him?
.At this medical supply warehouse.

73
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:32,032
No<i>,</i> he got a job? What a dick.

74
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:35,733
Shit<i>,</i> why didn't you say so?
Why don't we all go pick Freddy up?

75
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:38,208
He always knows
where there's a place to party.

76
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,046
Frank?

77
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,586
Yeah<i>,</i> kid?

78
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:54,450
What's the weirdest thing
you ever saw in here?

79
00:04:56,329 --> 00:05:00,857
l have seen weird things come<i>,</i>
and l have seen weird things go.

80
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:05,631
But the weirdest thing l ever saw
just had to cap it all.

81
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:08,271
Yeah? What's that?

82
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,600
Let me ask you a question<i>,</i> kid.

83
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:15,947
Did you see that movie
<i>Night of the Living Dead</i>?

84
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:19,545
That's the one where the corpses
start eating the people<i>,</i> right?

85
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,517
Sure. What about it?

86
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:24,789
Did you know that movie
was based on a true case?

87
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,892
Come on<i>,</i> you're shitting me<i>,</i> right?

88
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:30,586
l've never been more serious in my life.

89
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:35,028
That's not possible. They showed
<i>z</i>ombies taking over the world.

90
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:39,533
They changed it all around.
What really happened was...

91
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,832
...back in 1969<i>,</i> in Pittsburgh<i>,</i>
at the VA hospital...

92
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:45,774
...there was a chemical spill...

93
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:50,674
...and all that stuff leaked down
into the morgue...

94
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:55,685
...and it made all the dead bodies
jump around as though it was alive.

95
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:59,781
.What chemical?
.245.Trioxin<i>,</i> it's called.

96
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:03,353
lt was to spray on marijuana or something.

97
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:07,759
And the Darrow Chemical Company
was trying to develop it for the army.

98
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,333
And they told
the guy who made the movie...

99
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:15,496
...that if he told the true story<i>,</i>
they'd just sue his ass off.

100
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:18,839
So he changed all the facts around.

101
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:21,175
What really happened?

102
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:23,714
They closed it all down...

103
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:28,080
...and the army shipped
all that contaminated dirt...

104
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:30,451
...and all those dead bodies out.

105
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,419
And they kept it a secret.

106
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:38,420
How come you know about it?

107
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:41,523
A typical army fuck.up.

108
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:45,901
The transportation department got
the orders crossed...

109
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,938
...and they shipped those bodies here...

110
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,602
...instead of to
the Darrow Chemical Company.

111
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,245
Hello?

112
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,318
Hi<i>,</i> honey.
No<i>,</i> l'll be home in about an hour.

113
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,949
You keep the pot roast hot<i>,</i> okay?

114
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:11,927
Sure<i>,</i> l love you too<i>,</i> honey.
Yeah. Kiss<i>,</i> kiss.

115
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:18,930
Wanna see them?

116
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:23,671
.See them?
.The corpses.

117
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:27,535
What are you talking about?

118
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:30,341
.They're down in the basement.
.No.

119
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:33,879
.Come on.
.No way.

120
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:42,654
Mind the third step. lt's a bitch.

121
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,461
They just brought the bodies here
and left them?

122
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:47,226
You know the army.

123
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:51,827
.They've been here all this time?
.14 years<i>,</i> as l recall.

124
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:54,696
No kidding?

125
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:58,636
There they are.

126
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:01,410
There's bodies in there?

127
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:22,296
Shit. Look at that.

128
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:26,099
.You say that thing was alive?
.So they say.

129
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:33,337
Oh<i>,</i> God.

130
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:36,941
.Do these things leak?
.Hell<i>,</i> no.

131
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:40,280
These things were made
by the US Army Corps of Engineers.

132
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:29,020
.Hello<i>,</i> dear. How was your day?
.The usual<i>,</i> crap.

133
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:30,753
l'm sorry.

134
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:34,087
.What's for dinner?
.Your favorite<i>,</i> lamb chops.

135
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,956
l had them for lunch.

136
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:59,975
lt's me checking in
from Station 3 at 1600...

137
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:02,281
...make that 1601 hours.

138
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,549
l'll be home all evening. Right.

139
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:22,166
lt's nerve.racking to live
around that equipment all the time.

140
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:25,471
They have to be able to reach me
24 hours a day<i>,</i> wherever l am.

141
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,877
.You know that.
.All that microwave stuff affects my oven.

142
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:31,279
When we find them<i>,</i>
you can have it taken out.

143
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:35,285
.But when will you find them?
.Christ<i>,</i> Ethel<i>,</i> l don't know.

144
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:38,320
Maybe we'll never find them.

145
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:47,196
We've been through all this before.
They could be anywhere.

146
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,103
.Where the fuck are we going?
.To party.

147
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:57,297
To pick up Freddy.

148
00:12:57,409 --> 00:13:00,435
.What the fuck is Freddy up to these days?
.He got a job.

149
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,912
.No shit? What job?
.He's a stockroom clerk.

150
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:04,539
That sounds like a shitty job.

151
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:08,086
lt isn't the President of the US<i>,</i>
but he makes money to buy stuff.

152
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:12,248
.Maybe he'll buy something from me.
.He don't like your kind of stuff<i>,</i> Suicide.

153
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:14,883
How come you guys only come by
when you need a ride?

154
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:16,985
'Cause you one spooky motherfucker.

155
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:20,793
You think l'm spooky?
What the fuck do you think you are?

156
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:36,441
.Man<i>,</i> what a hideous<i>,</i> ugly place.
.l like it. lt's a statement.

157
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,540
.Come on<i>,</i> let's go get the prick.
.No.

158
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,710
.Why not?
.lt might freak out his boss.

159
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,378
That's not nice.

160
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:45,353
What does he think we are<i>,</i>
weird or something?

161
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:47,618
.What time does Freddy get off?
.10:00.

162
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:51,287
.l ain't sittin' here two fuckin' hours.
.We could go drive around.

163
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:54,696
.l don't got gas. You wanna buy some?
.l was kidding.

164
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,566
.We could go fool around in there.
.You mean that cemetery?

165
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:00,895
Let's do that.

166
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:21,716
What do you want to do<i>,</i>
turn over gravestones?

167
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:23,988
No<i>,</i> l just want to look around
the graveyard.

168
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:25,859
l ain't never seen one before.

169
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:29,093
.You never been to a funeral?
.l never knew nobody that died.

170
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,135
l don't think this is a good idea.

171
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:33,000
.What's that?
.Road flares<i>,</i> ass.wipe.

172
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:35,665
.What do you want with those?
.l just want to party.

173
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:37,935
What are the road flares for?

174
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:51,513
This place is a mess.

175
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:59,024
.lt looks like your pad<i>,</i> Scu<i>z</i>.
.l heard that.

176
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:13,604
Frank?

177
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,293
Are you okay<i>,</i> kid?

178
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:36,297
l don't know. l don't feel so good.

179
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:38,999
Christ<i>,</i> what a stink.

180
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:47,738
.What the hell happened to the body?
.lt must have melted when it hit the air.

181
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:49,837
Close the goddamn thing.

182
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:04,057
Christ<i>,</i> l never smelled anything
like that before.

183
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,290
l think l'm gonna be sick.

184
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:31,546
l don't guess
we'd better tell Burt about this.

185
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:35,559
.lt makes us look stupid or something.
.l can still smell that stuff.

186
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,993
lt must be in my nose
or all over everything.

187
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:41,260
l'd better spray some deodorant
around here.

188
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:57,811
What was that?

189
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:00,616
Sounds like a dog.

190
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:02,152
A dog?

191
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:06,684
Wait a second. Listen. You hear that?

192
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:09,354
What the hell's going on here?

193
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:24,066
What's wrong with him?

194
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:28,170
Shit!

195
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:32,841
.What are we gonna do?
.We're gonna kill it!

196
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,716
What are you doing? Stop!

197
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,194
Jesus!

198
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:53,161
.Are we fucked? What's happening?
.The cadaver.

199
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:56,965
.What's it doing in there?
.l don't know. lt sounds sore.

200
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:00,477
.What are we going to do?
.Lock it in.

201
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:05,416
Hurry! Jesus Christ!

202
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:08,514
We gotta think.

203
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:10,921
Come on<i>,</i> son<i>,</i> get in there!

204
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,156
Jesus Christ!

205
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:17,293
.Are we going cra<i>z</i>y?
.No<i>,</i> it's that crap from the tanks.

206
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:20,092
The goddamn chemicals<i>,</i>
it's all over everything.

207
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:23,498
.Stupid asshole!
.Watch your tongue if you like this job.

208
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,002
.Like this job?
.Think!

209
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:29,072
.We got to tell the cops.
.No<i>,</i> you don't want to call them.

210
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:30,869
You know what they'd do to the company?

211
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:33,570
.Who cares about the company?
.Our reputation!

212
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,613
.Fuck your reputation.
.Think!

213
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,242
What about the number on the tank?

214
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:42,446
.lt said<i>,</i> ''Call in case of an emergency.''
.No<i>,</i> that's the army.

215
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:46,285
You don't want the goddamn
army around this place. Think!

216
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:48,859
.What are we gonna do?
.What are we gonna do?

217
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,020
We're gonna call the boss.

218
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:06,006
Burt? Frank.

219
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:08,902
We have a little problem.

220
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,710
Do you ever fantasi<i>z</i>e...

221
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:15,782
...about being killed?

222
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:17,248
Never.

223
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:22,486
Do you ever wonder about
all the different ways of dying...

224
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,790
...you know<i>,</i> violently...

225
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:30,233
...and wonder what
would be the most horrible way to die?

226
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,263
l try not to think about dying too much.

227
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,168
For me...

228
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:39,838
...the worst way...

229
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:43,576
...would be for a bunch of old men...

230
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:45,947
...to get around me...

231
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:48,519
...and start biting...

232
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,118
...and eating me alive.

233
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:52,382
l see.

234
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,458
First...

235
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,757
...they would tear off my clothes.

236
00:19:58,096 --> 00:20:02,624
Let's get some light over here.
Trash is taking off her clothes again.

237
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:25,389
Throw it<i>,</i> baby.

238
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:27,422
Are you high on anything?

239
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:47,168
You opened it? You stupid moron.
What's the matter with you?

240
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:51,477
Haven't l always told you never
even to go near those goddamn tanks?

241
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:55,042
.What are we gonna do?
.Tell you what l'm gonna do.

242
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:58,816
l'm gonna be sued by the company<i>,</i>
investigated by the government.

243
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,085
l might become famous<i>,</i>
might lose my business.

244
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:04,321
l might even go to jail<i>,</i> goddamn it.
That's what l'm gonna do.

245
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:14,928
On the other hand<i>,</i> we destroy all the
evidence and we keep our mouths shut.

246
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,668
That's it! Let's do that.

247
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:21,144
That's what we got to do.

248
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:23,538
One question.

249
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:27,383
This guy screaming in here<i>,</i>
you're sure he's a dead cadaver?

250
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:32,287
.Why don't you open the door and find out?
.l'm sorry. l'll take your word for that.

251
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:36,191
lf it is a reanimated body<i>,</i>
we'll have to kill it.

252
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:40,463
.How do you kill something that's dead?
.How do l know?

253
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:43,966
.l don't know<i>,</i> let me think.
.lt's not a bad question.

254
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:47,599
ln that movie<i>,</i> they destroyed
the brain to kill them. Right?

255
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:49,435
The brain<i>,</i> right.

256
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:54,269
.What do doctors use to crack skulls with?
.Surgical drills.

257
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:55,607
Here<i>,</i> hold this.

258
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:58,842
Now listen to me very carefully.
Freddy<i>,</i> you'll open that door.

259
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:01,680
Come here<i>,</i> stand right over here.
Frank<i>,</i> right here.

260
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:04,017
When it comes out<i>,</i> brain it with the axe.

261
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:05,146
Jesus!

262
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:09,057
How am l gonna stop it from moaning?
What's the matter with you?

263
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,721
Come here. Get down there.
Stand by the door.

264
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:15,789
.lt's gonna be all right<i>,</i> son.
.l don't think l can do this.

265
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:18,062
You damn well better.
You got us into this.

266
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,134
Jesus!

267
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:22,997
All right<i>,</i> Freddy. 22<i>,</i> right.

268
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,247
Be brave<i>,</i> Frank<i>,</i> goddamn it!

269
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:32,482
4<i>,</i> left.

270
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:36,745
10<i>,</i> right.

271
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,898
Get him off!

272
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,386
Coming.

273
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:10,954
Hold it!

274
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:20,662
.What the hell's going on<i>,</i> Burt?
.The brain!

275
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,757
l hit the fucking brain!

276
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:26,395
Then do something else<i>,</i>
for goddamn.it.to.hell's sake.

277
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:28,567
Hold him down.

278
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:32,404
l can't stand this any longer.

279
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:35,237
.Shit!
.Hold him down now!

280
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:37,315
What are you gonna do?

281
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:45,116
.Be a man!
.l can't stand this<i>,</i> you son of a bitch.

282
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,285
Hurry up!

283
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,371
l'll get him.

284
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:13,076
l got him. Get a rope!

285
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:17,144
.Where the fuck's a rope?
.l don't know. Get one. Hold him down!

286
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:21,157
.Hang on to the son of a bitch!
.Christ<i>,</i> it ain't dying.

287
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:24,461
l thought you said
if we destroyed the brain<i>,</i> it'd die!

288
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:27,157
.lt worked in the movie.
.lt ain't working now.

289
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:30,393
.You mean the movie lied?
.Jesus.

290
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:40,074
.How are we gonna kill it?
.Maybe you can't. Maybe it won't die.

291
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:46,743
We just got to destroy it completely
until there's nothing left.

292
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:47,943
Acid.

293
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:52,186
.What kind of acid would dissolve a body?
.Sulfuric acid<i>,</i> maybe.

294
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:55,487
No<i>,</i> aqua regia<i>,</i> that's stronger.

295
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:59,257
But what if it doesn't dissolve everything<i>,</i>
like the bones?

296
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:01,032
Shit!

297
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:04,668
What are we gonna do?

298
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:09,135
Where are you going?

299
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,835
Sometimes Ernie Kaltenbrunner
works late on Fridays.

300
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:16,914
Who's Ernie Kaltenbrunner?

301
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:19,745
He's the embalmer
at the mortuary across the street.

302
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:23,617
.What the hell's he gonna do for us?
.His light's on. He's in.

303
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:28,653
Ernie's got a crematorium
across the street.

304
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,354
A crematorium<i>,</i> that's beautiful.

305
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:35,763
.Think you can get him to go along with it?
.l don't know. l've known him for 25 years.

306
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,698
He might do it out of friendship.

307
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:42,262
What the hell are you gonna tell him?
l mean<i>,</i> can you trust that bastard?

308
00:25:42,774 --> 00:25:45,106
l don't think we have a choice.

309
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:48,475
How we gonna get this thing over there?

310
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:56,677
Give me the bone saw.

311
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:03,790
Why don't you put your clothes on?
The show's over.

312
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:06,887
What's the matter?
Does it make you nervous?

313
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:09,532
l'm hot.

314
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,727
.You are hot.
.Scram<i>,</i> wimp.

315
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,577
Nobody understands me<i>,</i> you know that?

316
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:25,707
l fuckin' bust my ass for you guys<i>,</i>
and what do l get?

317
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:27,512
''You're spooky.''

318
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:30,147
Fuck you<i>,</i> man. Fuck you all.

319
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:31,916
l like it spooky.

320
00:26:32,857 --> 00:26:36,520
l got somethin' to say<i>,</i> you know?
What do you think this is all about?

321
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:40,394
You think this is a fuckin' costume?
This is a way of life!

322
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:41,925
Yes.

323
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:48,702
What's wrong with you<i>,</i> man?
Show some fucking respect for the dead.

324
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,074
ls that Freddy?

325
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:56,511
.Where?
.Over there<i>,</i> going into that building.

326
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,845
Nope. That is not Freddy.

327
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:03,350
.How would you know?
.Why would he be going into a mortuary?

328
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:57,572
What do you say<i>,</i> Ernie?

329
00:28:06,651 --> 00:28:09,347
.Take it easy.
.Sorry<i>,</i> l didn't hear you.

330
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:11,850
Fast on the draw.

331
00:28:14,592 --> 00:28:18,892
.You are working late tonight.
.Pretty much. Kind of....

332
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:22,289
What time is it? You want a cup of coffee?

333
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,858
.No<i>,</i> thank you. l'm all right.
.l do<i>,</i> and l need it.

334
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:31,939
What are you doing there?

335
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:34,845
Breaking out the rigor mortis.

336
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,206
Yeah?

337
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:38,779
Come here.

338
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:44,354
Come on.
You see<i>,</i> rigor mortis starts in the brain.

339
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:49,257
And it spreads down to the internal organs<i>,</i>
and it finally settles in the muscles.

340
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:55,229
lt loosens up after a while...

341
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:59,969
...but you can break it out manually<i>,</i>
as they say...

342
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,967
...by flexing the muscles.

343
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,798
.See that?
.Yeah.

344
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,305
You'll not find that in a book<i>,</i> my friend.

345
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:10,279
The embalming business is basically
passed on by word of mouth.

346
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:13,976
l'll tell you<i>,</i> that's fascinating<i>,</i>
that's really something.

347
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:20,451
He's dead now. And l am bushed.

348
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:26,058
Buddy boy.

349
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:30,301
How long we been friends?
About how long?

350
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,963
Twenty.five years<i>,</i> give or take.

351
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:38,699
lf l ask you a favor<i>,</i>
could you keep it quiet?

352
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,402
Sure. What is it?

353
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:44,809
l'm gonna need some help
in a pretty big way<i>,</i> really.

354
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:48,117
You can depend on me.
Why? What's wrong?

355
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,848
l got a couple of my men out here<i>,</i>
you mind if l let them in?

356
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:54,049
No<i>,</i> that's illegal.

357
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,252
You can bring it on in now<i>,</i> please.

358
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:59,956
You can put it right over here. Right here.

359
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:04,466
What is that?

360
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:10,333
.Right there<i>,</i> please.
.Here?

361
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:20,714
l got to....

362
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:27,319
What the hell's in those bags?

363
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,127
Rabid weasels.

364
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:33,129
What the hell are you doing
with a bunch of rabid weasels?

365
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:35,825
l was trying to explain it.
They came as a shipment.

366
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:39,802
They weren't supposed to be rabid<i>,</i>
but you know how these things happen.

367
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:41,337
l don't. How do they happen?

368
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:43,839
Watch out<i>,</i> don't get bit.

369
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:46,568
Anyway<i>,</i> we got them<i>,</i>
and we need your help.

370
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:49,875
.How?
.We got to get rid of these things.

371
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:52,415
Why don't you call an animal shelter?

372
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:56,248
Word'd get out<i>,</i> hurt my business.
You know<i>,</i> that's a bad scene<i>,</i> rabies.

373
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:57,784
l don't think so.

374
00:30:57,889 --> 00:31:00,687
l mean<i>,</i> so what?
You don't run a pet store.

375
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:05,627
Some lab animals got rabies.
Come on<i>,</i> take them to the pound.

376
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:10,530
l just can't do that.
You got to take my word for it.

377
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:15,806
.What the hell do you want me to do?
.You have a crematorium<i>,</i> right?

378
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:18,398
.You wanna burn them?
.That's what l had in mind.

379
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:22,003
.That's cruel.
.l can't think of anything else to do.

380
00:31:22,113 --> 00:31:26,743
You just can't burn animals alive.
lt's just too hideous.

381
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:28,818
At least let me kill them first.

382
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:32,151
Take them out in the parking lot<i>,</i>
and put 'em out of their misery.

383
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:35,782
l don't think that'd work.

384
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:39,590
l don't understand what's going on.
Why not?

385
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:49,829
.Can you swear to keep a secret?
.At this point<i>,</i> l don't know.

386
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:53,570
No<i>,</i> you got to swear.
You got to<i>,</i> or l just can't tell you.

387
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:57,580
.All right<i>,</i> l swear.
.Good.

388
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:04,551
lt's not weasels in the bags.

389
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:08,124
No kidding. Look here.

390
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:20,837
Get it off!

391
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:34,776
l'm sorry.

392
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:37,286
No<i>,</i> it's all right.

393
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:45,853
We got a....

394
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,561
We got a long story to tell you.

395
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:53,133
Great. Some party.
What happened to Trash and Suicide?

396
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:55,936
Probably getting it on somewhere.

397
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:59,534
Don't even think it<i>,</i> Chuck.

398
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:02,611
God<i>,</i> when's 10:00 gonna come?

399
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,973
lf you wanna split<i>,</i>
we could both go somewhere.

400
00:33:08,052 --> 00:33:11,180
You'd really like to do it with me<i>,</i>
wouldn't you?

401
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:16,359
.l mean<i>,</i> a girl like you and a guy like me.
.Go choke a chicken.

402
00:33:16,694 --> 00:33:19,492
Come on<i>,</i> Casey. l was only kidding.

403
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:23,862
.Great<i>,</i> here's your friend and mine.
.Fuck you<i>,</i> ball buster.

404
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:28,505
My watch stopped. What time is it?

405
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:36,107
Going on 10:00.

406
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:40,376
Fudge. l'd better get over and find Freddy.
He's gonna be getting off any time.

407
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:41,918
Go ahead<i>,</i> we'll wait for you.

408
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,181
.Don't go anywhere<i>,</i> okay?
.All right.

409
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:46,883
Come on<i>,</i> Freddy<i>,</i> where are you?

410
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:51,481
Frankly<i>,</i> l think you acted
precipitously in cutting up the corpse.

411
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:54,251
You may be right<i>,</i> l don't know<i>,</i> but l did it.

412
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:56,849
What are we gonna do about it?

413
00:34:58,496 --> 00:35:01,829
lf l let you use the crematorium<i>,</i>
what's in it for me?

414
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:05,493
What do you want?

415
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:11,575
The way l see it<i>,</i> this is a pretty big favor.

416
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:16,511
You got it! Whatever it is you want<i>,</i>
so help me<i>,</i> l'll do it. l promise.

417
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:21,480
l'm sorry about that.

418
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:47,243
Let's take care of your problem.

419
00:35:57,522 --> 00:35:59,217
You're gonna owe me a big one.

420
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:02,053
You're gonna get rid of everything for me.
Nothing left.

421
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,424
.ls that right?
.Everything'll go.

422
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,596
What about the bones?

423
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:14,603
Bones are no problem.
The hardest thing to burn is the heart.

424
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:19,035
.The heart? Why?
.'Cause it's just one big<i>,</i> tough muscle.

425
00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:23,705
Come on.
We don't want the heart sticking around.

426
00:36:23,814 --> 00:36:25,645
Then l'll turn it up hotter for it.

427
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,684
What about the split dogs? They got to go.

428
00:36:27,785 --> 00:36:29,946
The split dogs will go<i>,</i> too.

429
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:36,220
Come on<i>,</i> just give me a hand.
lt's your mess.

430
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:46,825
Some big favor.
l can operate that goddamn thing.

431
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:49,439
You're absolutely certain...

432
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:52,733
...that this will get rid of everything
and do the trick?

433
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:55,903
.Nothing left?
.Nothing but a little.bitty pile of ashes.

434
00:36:56,013 --> 00:36:57,742
We don't even want the ashes.

435
00:36:57,848 --> 00:37:01,875
Then l'll turn it up higher<i>,</i>
and we'll burn up the ashes<i>,</i> too.

436
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:06,580
Dust to dust.

437
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:06,382
.My radio.
.Come on<i>,</i> you guys.

438
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:08,952
Let's get back to the car. Damn it.

439
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,549
Come on.

440
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:27,164
Freddy?

441
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,534
Anybody?

442
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:32,107
Get the fuckin' top! Fuck.

443
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:38,041
Come on!

444
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:43,583
.Close the motherfuckin' windows.
.l don't have any windows.

445
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:45,053
l busted them.

446
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:48,656
.Hey<i>,</i> my skin burns.
.Me<i>,</i> too. Damn it.

447
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:50,852
lt's that rain<i>,</i> it's like acid rain.

448
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:52,428
Start the car!

449
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:55,055
lt's all over me.
A towel<i>,</i> somebody give me a towel.

450
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:58,192
.We ain't got no towel!
.Well<i>,</i> then give me something.

451
00:38:58,302 --> 00:39:00,133
.Give me that.
.No!

452
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:03,068
Come on<i>,</i> start!

453
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,836
.Suicide<i>,</i> get the car going.

.Right up the chimney.

458
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:03,390

00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:14,300
Let's go to the warehouse<i>,</i> clean up<i>,</i>

462
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,709
What do you say<i>,</i> Frank?

463
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:20,113

.And l want to puke. And l'm weak<i>,</i> too.
.Me<i>,</i> too. l got the chills.

470
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:44,139
lt's that stuff<i>,</i> Burt.
lt's that goddamn stuff we breathed.

471

What stuff? What are you talking about?

472
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:49,642
When that canister cracked<i>,</i>
this gas squirted out.

00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:51,772
lt hit us right in the face.

474
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:53,540

.We were out cold<i>,</i> unconscious.
.Christ!

477
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:02,753
Shouldn't we get to a doctor
or something?

478
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,122

485
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:33,284
You can't run around in this storm.
You're too sick.

486
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:34,550
Burt.

487
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,060

Hello. Yes. Can we get some paramedics
over here right away?

Tell them to come around the back<i>,</i>
to the embalming room.

494
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:16,262
Poison. We have two men poisoned here.

495
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:19,498

Who's there?

Stick your tongue out for me.

534
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:27,777
What did you guys take?

535
00:47:27,878 --> 00:47:32,474
lt was some kind of industrial chemical<i>,</i>
something in a tank.

536
00:47:33,116 --> 00:47:36,847
.What tank? Where?
.Well<i>,</i> we're not sure<i>,</i> really.

537
00:47:36,987 --> 00:47:40,354
Can you find out?
Your friends' lives may depend on it.

538
00:47:40,457 --> 00:47:45,190
l got to make some phone calls<i>,</i>
but l can't do that before morning. Sorry.

539
00:47:45,395 --> 00:47:47,556

What do you mean?

543
00:48:01,845 --> 00:48:04,439
l'm not getting anything on this<i>,</i> either.

544
00:48:04,748 --> 00:48:06,511
What do you mean? What's wrong?

545
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:11,787
lt's all right. We just need
to double.check a couple things.

546
00:48:21,431 --> 00:48:23,592
.No blood pressure.
.No pulse.

547
00:48:24,101 --> 00:48:26,365
What do you mean<i>,</i>
''no blood pressure<i>,</i> no pulse''?

548
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:27,903
Take it easy.

00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:41,917
.Well<i>,</i> what's that?
.Room temperature.

552
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:46,951
Come over here for a second.

553
00:48:51,962 --> 00:48:53,930
What are you guys saying?

554
00:48:57,467 --> 00:49:00,436
.What was that thing down there?
.What are we gonna do?

555
00:49:00,537 --> 00:49:04,098
.Suicide is down there.
.No<i>,</i> he's gone. That thing ate his head.

556
00:49:04,207 --> 00:49:05,469
Jesus!

557
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:09,979
.l don't hear anything down there.
.We got to call somebody.

558
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,809
.Who?
.The cops.

559
00:49:11,915 --> 00:49:14,941
l don't want to call no cop.
They're just gonna kick our ass.

560
00:49:15,052 --> 00:49:18,749
.Just let's get out of here<i>,</i> okay?
.We gotta call somebody.

561
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:21,151
Wait a minute<i>,</i> where's Freddy?

562
00:49:46,616 --> 00:49:50,017
Holy shit. We're gonna have to swim
to get over there.

563
00:49:51,688 --> 00:49:54,213
.What the fuck was that?
.Look!

564

Hey<i>,</i> wait up<i>,</i> you guys!
Wait<i>,</i> l got no shoes!

566
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:48,869
You have no pulse<i>,</i> no blood pressure.

567
00:50:48,979 --> 00:50:53,507
You have no pupillary response<i>,</i> no
reflexes<i>,</i> your temperature is 70 degrees.

568
00:50:55,085 --> 00:50:56,450
What does that mean?

569
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:59,989
lt's a pu<i>zz</i>le<i>,</i>
because technically you're not alive.

570
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:02,854
Except you're conscious<i>,</i>
so we don't know what it means.

571
00:51:02,959 --> 00:51:05,723
.Are you saying we're dead?
.Let's not jump to conclusions.

572
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:08,593
Obviously<i>,</i> l didn't mean
you were really dead.

573
00:51:08,832 --> 00:51:11,426
Dead people don't move around and talk.

574
00:51:12,269 --> 00:51:14,134
.What is that?
.The front door.

575
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:16,705
.What the fuck are they doing?
.l'll find out.

576
00:51:16,807 --> 00:51:18,832
We're gonna get a couple of stretchers.

577
00:51:18,942 --> 00:51:21,706
Just hang in there. We won't be a second.

.Don't shoot<i>,</i> man!

581
00:51:36,893 --> 00:51:39,088
Are you cra<i>z</i>y? Are you on PCP?

582
00:51:39,196 --> 00:51:41,164
None of us are on any drugs. Let us in!

583
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:44,324
.All right<i>,</i> come in. But no funny moves.
.Shit<i>,</i> no.

584
00:51:44,534 --> 00:51:47,833

00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:51,934
.What?
.Shut up and listen<i>,</i> man!

587
00:51:54,811 --> 00:51:57,041
.What is it?
.lt's dead people screaming.

588
00:51:57,147 --> 00:52:00,082
.What dead people?
.They came from out of the ground.

589
00:52:00,183 --> 00:52:02,208
.And they're after us.
.Out of the ground?

590
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:05,186
Our friends took off the other way.
They're out there now!

591
00:52:08,191 --> 00:52:09,624
Brains!

592
00:52:21,671 --> 00:52:24,401
.Trash? Where's Trash?
.Didn't she go with them?

593
00:52:24,508 --> 00:52:26,499
l thought she was with us.

594
00:52:28,845 --> 00:52:31,006
.Do you hear that?
.Hear what?

595
00:52:33,683 --> 00:52:35,207
Christ. Jesus.

596
00:52:35,919 --> 00:52:39,116
.What is that?
.lt sounds like people screaming.

597
00:52:39,923 --> 00:52:43,859
You get the stretchers<i>,</i>
l'll get on the radio and phone this in.

598
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,406
Jerry?

599
00:53:12,422 --> 00:53:14,014
Brain!

600
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:20,989
.What kind of a problem?
.Take a look at it.

601
00:53:21,097 --> 00:53:23,088
What the hell's going on out here?

602
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,328
That graveyard out there is full
of people coming out the ground.

603
00:53:26,436 --> 00:53:29,200
.''Out of the ground''?
.Out of the ground.

604
00:53:29,306 --> 00:53:30,705
They're horrible<i>,</i> they scream.

605
00:53:30,807 --> 00:53:32,638
.You've got to do something.
.Scream?

606
00:53:32,742 --> 00:53:36,200
Yes<i>,</i> they're out there.
There's one of them in that warehouse.

607
00:53:36,313 --> 00:53:38,577
.Which warehouse?
.The medical supply house.

608
00:53:38,682 --> 00:53:40,081
Shit!

609
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:41,944
Goddamn!

610
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:44,577
l think things are getting out of hand.

611
00:53:44,688 --> 00:53:47,350
There's 100 of those things out there.

612
00:53:47,457 --> 00:53:48,424
A hundred?

613
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:51,994
.The cops. We got to call the cops.
.Yeah. No shit.

614
00:53:52,696 --> 00:53:55,859
Phone. Where the fuck is the phone?

615
00:53:55,966 --> 00:53:57,866
There's an office!

616
00:54:02,806 --> 00:54:06,401
Hello<i>,</i> Operator<i>,</i> give me the police.
This is an emergency.

617
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:14,273
Grab the hammer and nails! Casey!

618
00:54:15,385 --> 00:54:18,479
Quiet! Let's just get the hell
out of here<i>,</i> Ernie.

619
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:20,351
.You got a car?
.l got a car.

620
00:54:20,457 --> 00:54:23,585
.Get your keys. Let's get out of here.
.My clutch is shot.

621
00:54:23,693 --> 00:54:26,093
We'll use the paramedic ambulance.

622
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:27,756
Freddy!

623
00:54:28,064 --> 00:54:29,156
.Ernie?
.Yeah?

624
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:32,633
.Where are the paramedics?
.l'll go get them. Get my own car started.

625
00:54:32,736 --> 00:54:36,001
Oh<i>,</i> my God. What did they do to you?

626
00:55:18,448 --> 00:55:19,676
God!

627
00:55:19,783 --> 00:55:21,341
.What was that shooting?
.God!

628
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:23,510
.What?
.God!

629
00:55:26,189 --> 00:55:28,623
.What the hell?
.lt....

630
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:33,455
''lt'' what? What is ''it''?

631
00:55:33,563 --> 00:55:35,554
They're all over the cars.

632
00:55:36,132 --> 00:55:38,327
lt's horrible. They're out there.

633
00:55:39,636 --> 00:55:43,299
Paramedics are dead.
And we can't take the cars.

634
00:55:43,907 --> 00:55:46,876
We've got to call the police.

635
00:55:46,976 --> 00:55:50,241
Set him down. Easy.

636
00:55:53,616 --> 00:55:55,550
.lt's not working.
.Come on.

637
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:16,365
.What's the matter?
.Dead.

638
00:56:28,017 --> 00:56:29,314
Help me.

639
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:39,491
You got some hammer and nails?

640
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:03,613
.Where else can they get in here?
.The windows in the chapel.

641
00:57:09,726 --> 00:57:12,593
Get something to bar these windows with.

642
00:57:12,695 --> 00:57:14,686
l put boards outside the glass.

643
00:57:29,312 --> 00:57:33,009
<i>Rescue 7, come in. This is Dispatch. Over.</i>

644
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:39,653
<i>Rescue 7, this is Dispatch.</i>
<i>Do you copy? Over.</i>

645
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:42,753
Come in<i>,</i> Dispatch.

646
00:57:43,026 --> 00:57:44,323
Send...

647
00:57:44,427 --> 00:57:45,655
...more...

648
00:57:45,762 --> 00:57:47,161
...paramedics.

649
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:04,871
How many fucking windows you got here?

650
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:06,710
No more windows.

651
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,418
The embalming room has steel shutters.

652
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:12,920
Let's get the hell back
to the embalming room then.

653
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:19,494
Man<i>,</i> my arms are dead.

654
00:58:19,596 --> 00:58:23,225
Put that goddamn thing down
before you hurt somebody with it.

655
00:58:23,433 --> 00:58:24,627
How they doing?

656
00:58:24,734 --> 00:58:27,168
.Are you all right?
.lt hurts.

657
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:31,104
What did you do to Freddy?
What's wrong with him? And this man?

658
00:58:31,207 --> 00:58:33,505
lt's time you tell us
what the fuck's going on.

659
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:36,738
.l don't have to tell you anything.
.We think you should.

660
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:38,438
Tell them<i>,</i> goddamn it!

661
00:58:40,316 --> 00:58:41,510
Tell us!

662
00:58:42,252 --> 00:58:43,947
There was a chemical.

663
00:58:45,221 --> 00:58:47,155
Some chemical soaked into the...

664
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:50,351
...soil of the graveyard
and made the corpses come back to life.

665
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:54,226
.What fucking chemical?
.l don't know what chemical<i>,</i> goddamn it!

666
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:57,026
lt was ordered by the military<i>,</i>
l think it was.

667
00:58:57,133 --> 00:58:59,829
Would you tell me how
it got all over the graveyard?

668
00:58:59,936 --> 00:59:01,961
l don't know. l just....

669
00:59:02,338 --> 00:59:05,671
All l know is they were stored
over at the medical supply warehouse...

670
00:59:05,775 --> 00:59:09,802
...where you were<i>,</i> and these two geniuses
managed to open the goddamn container...

671
00:59:09,913 --> 00:59:12,848
...and let the son of a bitch out.
Let 'em out!

672
00:59:12,949 --> 00:59:16,112
.ls that why Freddy's sick?
.l breathed it<i>,</i> Tina.

673
00:59:16,753 --> 00:59:18,778
So did Frank there.

674
00:59:21,324 --> 00:59:24,293
.What did it do to you?
.l'm free<i>z</i>ing.

675
00:59:25,328 --> 00:59:26,818
My muscles are stiffening up.

676
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:28,822
Stiffening up?

677
00:59:29,432 --> 00:59:31,332
Stiffening up how?

678
00:59:31,434 --> 00:59:33,834
First<i>,</i> l got a really fucked headache.

679
00:59:34,504 --> 00:59:37,905
Then my stomach started cramping up.

680
00:59:38,508 --> 00:59:40,908
Now my arms and legs are cramping.

681
00:59:42,478 --> 00:59:45,413
.Let's take a look.
.Oh<i>,</i> God!

682
00:59:48,451 --> 00:59:50,385
Let's get his shirt up.

683
00:59:51,287 --> 00:59:54,017
.What are you doing?
.Oh<i>,</i> God.

684
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:57,782
The bruises where he's lying down...

685
00:59:59,295 --> 01:00:01,160
...that's blood pooling up.

686
01:00:03,533 --> 01:00:04,898
Easy.

687
01:00:07,236 --> 01:00:08,294
Okay.

688
01:00:12,742 --> 01:00:16,303
You know<i>,</i>
it looks like rigor mortis is setting in.

689
01:00:16,813 --> 01:00:20,078
Rigor mortis?
What do you mean<i>,</i> rigor mortis?

690
01:00:21,084 --> 01:00:24,019
God<i>,</i> you're dead.

691
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:26,987
You're dead<i>,</i> and you'll turn
into one of those things.

692
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:28,079
No!

693
01:00:30,927 --> 01:00:32,918
.Let him go!
.Son of a bitch!

694
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:39,059
Do you hear that?

695
01:00:43,072 --> 01:00:46,269
.What is that?
.lt's another paramedic ambulance.

696
01:00:57,453 --> 01:01:00,513
.Watch out!
.Don't go over there!

697
01:01:06,062 --> 01:01:07,495
Damn!

698
01:01:07,597 --> 01:01:10,566
They're gonna kill everybody
that comes here.

699
01:01:29,819 --> 01:01:33,084
Watch out<i>,</i>
l'm going to put the board back up.

700
01:01:36,993 --> 01:01:38,358
lt's got me!

701
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:57,312
Get this thing out of here!

702
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:00,849
Pull her off.

703
01:02:03,486 --> 01:02:04,350
Christ.

704
01:02:05,655 --> 01:02:07,418
Damn<i>,</i> he's dead. Shit.

705
01:02:08,491 --> 01:02:10,288
What do we do with this thing?

706
01:02:11,527 --> 01:02:14,360
.Just wait there a second.
.Let's get out of here.

707
01:02:14,464 --> 01:02:17,763
.Where the fuck is he going?
.What are you doing?

708
01:02:22,138 --> 01:02:23,628
Let me take it!

709
01:02:23,906 --> 01:02:26,739
.You can let go of it now.
.Are you cra<i>z</i>y?

710
01:02:27,543 --> 01:02:30,808
Look at it. She looks better now.

711
01:02:32,882 --> 01:02:34,577
We got to get out of here.

712
01:02:35,618 --> 01:02:38,109
We got to get the fuck out of here.

713
01:02:38,521 --> 01:02:39,818
Leave it.

714
01:02:40,223 --> 01:02:43,283
What are you doing? Goddamn it!

715
01:02:44,794 --> 01:02:46,921
l don't understand what you want with it.

716
01:02:47,029 --> 01:02:49,554
.What are we doing with it?
.l want to examine it.

717
01:02:49,665 --> 01:02:52,634
.You make sure it's tied right.
.lt's being tied right.

718
01:02:52,735 --> 01:02:56,762
.lt's not gonna get loose<i>,</i> right?
.No<i>,</i> it's not gonna get loose.

719
01:02:56,873 --> 01:02:59,307
They're no stronger than humans.

720
01:03:05,481 --> 01:03:08,780
.Don't be afraid.
.l'll bust it in the damn head.

721
01:03:09,352 --> 01:03:11,252
You sure that thing's tied good?

722
01:03:12,855 --> 01:03:15,483
.You can hear me?
.Yes.

723
01:03:19,862 --> 01:03:21,193
Why do you eat people?

724
01:03:21,597 --> 01:03:24,930
Not people<i>,</i> brains.

725
01:03:25,034 --> 01:03:27,434
.Brains only?
.Yes.

726
01:03:29,005 --> 01:03:32,168
.Why?
.The pain.

727
01:03:33,342 --> 01:03:37,904
.What about the pain?
.The pain of being dead.

728
01:03:43,352 --> 01:03:44,979
lt hurts to be dead.

729
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:50,289
l can feel myself rot.

730
01:03:52,295 --> 01:03:54,024
Eating brains...

731
01:03:55,031 --> 01:03:57,465
...how does that make you feel?

732
01:03:57,667 --> 01:03:59,999
lt makes the pain...

733
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:02,095
...go away.

734
01:04:08,144 --> 01:04:12,444
Look<i>,</i> man<i>,</i> fuck this.
l got to talk to you. Now.

735
01:04:14,717 --> 01:04:17,311
Come on<i>,</i> l got to talk. We got to talk.

736
01:04:19,288 --> 01:04:21,415
Let's talk out in the hall.

737
01:04:26,996 --> 01:04:30,329
Look<i>,</i> how can we kill those things?

738
01:04:30,733 --> 01:04:32,132
You don't.

739
01:04:32,301 --> 01:04:33,996
What do you mean<i>,</i> ''you don't''?

740
01:04:34,103 --> 01:04:36,367
You can't kill them<i>,</i> they're already dead.

741
01:04:36,472 --> 01:04:39,066
They're not living creatures<i>,</i>
they're animated.

742
01:04:39,175 --> 01:04:42,406
You can chop them up into pieces<i>,</i>
they'll still come after you.

743
01:04:42,511 --> 01:04:44,172
All you can do is burn them.

744
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:47,875
You got to reduce them to ashes<i>,</i>
so there's nothing left to come after you.

745
01:04:47,984 --> 01:04:50,077
How you gonna burn all those things?

746
01:04:50,186 --> 01:04:54,850
.There's 100 of those fuckers.
.That is the question.

747
01:05:54,817 --> 01:05:56,682
We have a 10.32 from EMS.

748
01:05:56,786 --> 01:06:00,552
Two<i>,</i> repeat<i>,</i> two paramedic vehicles
missing in the East Piedmont district.

749
01:06:00,656 --> 01:06:02,453
Request a 10.51<i>,</i> Code 3.

750
01:06:02,558 --> 01:06:06,324
Available units near the 20<i>,</i>000 block
of East Central<i>,</i> please respond<i>,</i> over.

751
01:06:06,729 --> 01:06:08,993
Do you think they'll rescue us?

752
01:06:10,032 --> 01:06:12,694
They better. That's all l got to say.

753
01:06:18,274 --> 01:06:20,435
But do you think they will?

754
01:06:28,851 --> 01:06:29,875
Chuck?

755
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:33,417
l never did like you.

756
01:06:35,224 --> 01:06:37,988
Oh<i>,</i> my God<i>,</i> hold me tight.

757
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:42,494
l think it would be a lot wiser
if we contained Frank and Freddy.

758
01:06:42,598 --> 01:06:45,431
.You know what l'm saying?
.What do you mean<i>,</i> ''contained''?

759
01:06:45,534 --> 01:06:49,402
Lock them up<i>,</i> so if they started
acting funny<i>,</i> they wouldn't hurt anybody.

760
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:50,972
They don't want to hurt anybody.

761
01:06:51,073 --> 01:06:53,405
You bastard!
Why don't you lock yourselves up?

762
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:56,603
We're not proposing doing
anything to them<i>,</i> for Christ's sake.

763
01:06:56,712 --> 01:07:00,443
We want to lock them up so we can
figure out how to get the hell out of here.

764
01:07:00,549 --> 01:07:02,813
Tina<i>,</i> that really is a good idea.

765
01:07:02,918 --> 01:07:06,649
.Where can we put them?
.Yeah<i>,</i> well<i>,</i> the chapel.

766
01:07:06,822 --> 01:07:09,416
All right<i>,</i> help me with Frank<i>,</i> please.

767
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:11,493
.Lift his feet.
.Come on.

768
01:07:26,776 --> 01:07:28,107
On the rug.

769
01:07:30,413 --> 01:07:32,779
Lay them on the carpet<i>,</i> gently.

770
01:07:33,783 --> 01:07:34,977
Easy.

771
01:07:35,251 --> 01:07:38,186
Easy. lt's all right. Can you hear me?

772
01:07:38,687 --> 01:07:40,382
Boy<i>,</i> he's gone.

773
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:44,321
Freddy.

774
01:07:45,528 --> 01:07:47,587
Let's just leave them and get out.

775
01:07:47,696 --> 01:07:51,462
.l'm not leaving Freddy.
.We got to lock the door<i>,</i> you know?

776
01:07:52,601 --> 01:07:53,727
l'm staying.

777
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:57,899
Okay. Come on.

778
01:08:08,517 --> 01:08:11,975
Dispatch. This is Bravo 751.

779
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:13,715
We're at the mortuary.

780
01:08:13,823 --> 01:08:18,658
We see two<i>,</i> that is two<i>,</i> paramedic
vehicles parked in the rear parking lot.

781
01:08:18,961 --> 01:08:23,762
The doors on one vehicle are hanging open.
Stand by while we investigate. Over.

782
01:08:48,190 --> 01:08:49,953
l got a man down.

783
01:08:54,730 --> 01:08:55,856
Jesus!

784
01:08:59,335 --> 01:09:01,098
Hold it right there!

785
01:09:01,203 --> 01:09:04,172
Free<i>z</i>e or l'll blow your fucking brains out!

786
01:09:08,043 --> 01:09:09,601
This place....

787
01:09:10,312 --> 01:09:12,143
Everybody that comes in...

788
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:14,180
...gets swallowed up.

789
01:09:15,351 --> 01:09:17,148
Send more cops.

790
01:09:17,586 --> 01:09:18,553
What do we do?

791
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:21,646
Stand here<i>,</i>
beating our meat till the corpses bust in?

792
01:09:21,757 --> 01:09:23,782
We can't stop them. We got to get out.

793
01:09:23,893 --> 01:09:24,985
We got to get to the cars.

794
01:09:25,094 --> 01:09:27,358
.There's corpses all over the cars.
.l know.

795
01:09:27,463 --> 01:09:28,828
What are you proposing?

796
01:09:28,931 --> 01:09:32,367
What am l proposing?
l think we all should do some proposing.

797
01:09:32,468 --> 01:09:35,960
The crawlspace in the ceiling.
We could go up<i>,</i> barricade ourselves in.

798
01:09:36,071 --> 01:09:38,631
Only way up is the hatch<i>,</i>
and we could nail that shut.

799
01:09:38,741 --> 01:09:42,268
You must be out of your mind.
l'm not barricading myself in no roof.

800
01:09:42,378 --> 01:09:44,505
l'd rather take my chances with the cars.

801
01:09:44,613 --> 01:09:46,103
We need a way to fight them.

802
01:09:46,215 --> 01:09:47,705
How about this?

803
01:09:48,317 --> 01:09:49,409
What is that?

804
01:09:49,518 --> 01:09:52,487
lt's nitric acid.
Pretty much destroy anything.

805
01:09:52,588 --> 01:09:55,079
But there's not enough of it.

806
01:10:04,934 --> 01:10:06,561
lt hurts!

807
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:11,271
.lt hurts more than you can imagine.
.l know.

808
01:10:15,611 --> 01:10:16,771
Freddy!

809
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:29,922
l can finally see...

810
01:10:30,693 --> 01:10:32,320
...the one thing...

811
01:10:33,329 --> 01:10:36,230
...that can relieve this horrible suffering.

812
01:10:36,332 --> 01:10:37,959
What?

813
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,664
Live brains!

814
01:11:25,481 --> 01:11:26,846
Get the girl!

815
01:11:29,785 --> 01:11:31,377
Run!

816
01:11:33,656 --> 01:11:35,317
Put her on the couch.

817
01:11:36,492 --> 01:11:38,619
They got Freddy.

818
01:11:39,728 --> 01:11:42,128
lt was horrible<i>,</i> ugly<i>,</i> man.

819
01:11:42,665 --> 01:11:45,259
His face was all fucked up.

820
01:11:48,037 --> 01:11:49,163
He's not Freddy.

821
01:11:49,271 --> 01:11:50,898
Brains.

822
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:55,971
Make her shut up.

823
01:11:57,813 --> 01:11:59,144
Brains.

824
01:12:08,791 --> 01:12:10,952
Shit<i>,</i> he's trying to get out.

825
01:12:11,126 --> 01:12:12,559
Get a bench<i>,</i> come on.

826
01:12:17,666 --> 01:12:19,258
Out of the way!

827
01:12:23,105 --> 01:12:26,268
Bring it against it. lt's all right.

828
01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:30,008
.l can't.
.Yes<i>,</i> you can. Get up!

829
01:12:30,846 --> 01:12:33,371
We can't stay here.
lt's gonna bust through the door.

830
01:12:33,482 --> 01:12:35,177
We got to run for the cars.

831
01:12:36,218 --> 01:12:38,152
There's <i>z</i>ombies all over the cars.

832
01:12:38,253 --> 01:12:41,222
Got to fight our way through them<i>,</i>
there's no other way.

833
01:12:41,323 --> 01:12:44,451
Once we're in the car and moving<i>,</i>
l think we'll be all right.

834
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,494
That's a big fucking ''if<i>,</i>'' man.

835
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:50,423
l can't walk<i>,</i> much less run.

836
01:12:50,966 --> 01:12:52,763
How bad is your foot?

837
01:12:53,569 --> 01:12:55,264
lt's broke.

838
01:13:05,681 --> 01:13:08,479
We get one of the cars<i>,</i>
bring it near the door.

839
01:13:08,584 --> 01:13:12,281
Police car. lt should still have
the keys in the ignition.

840
01:13:12,421 --> 01:13:14,286
The motor is still running.

841
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:16,950
.Good. l'll drive.
.No<i>,</i> l'll drive.

842
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:18,321
Fuck you.

843
01:13:18,427 --> 01:13:21,487
When we drive up here<i>,</i>
l don't want to hang out there long.

844
01:13:21,597 --> 01:13:24,327
You stand right here.
Put one hand here and another here.

845
01:13:24,433 --> 01:13:26,458
When l say ''now<i>,</i>'' you open the door fast.

846
01:13:26,568 --> 01:13:29,298
The minute we're through<i>,</i>
you slam it hard and lock it.

847
01:13:30,639 --> 01:13:33,267
Get your ass over here at the door.

848
01:13:39,581 --> 01:13:40,912
Burt....

849
01:13:41,617 --> 01:13:45,610
That favor that you owe me.
Watch your ass out there.

850
01:13:49,625 --> 01:13:50,922
All right<i>,</i> stand by.

851
01:13:55,564 --> 01:13:56,724
Now!

852
01:14:23,358 --> 01:14:25,553
You got to get closer. They can't make it.

853
01:14:25,661 --> 01:14:28,528
.We got to split.
.No<i>,</i> we can't split.

854
01:14:35,671 --> 01:14:37,730
They left us<i>,</i> those jerks!

855
01:14:39,107 --> 01:14:40,472
They had to.

856
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:43,571
Burt will send help.

857
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:45,678
l know him.

858
01:14:46,215 --> 01:14:47,648
They left us.

859
01:14:49,184 --> 01:14:52,676
.What are you doing? We can't leave.
.They'd have turned the car over.

860
01:14:52,788 --> 01:14:53,880
We'll send help.

861
01:14:53,989 --> 01:14:57,618
.Those are my fucking friends back there.
.l said we'll send help.

862
01:14:57,726 --> 01:14:59,284
.Coward!
.Fuck you!

863
01:15:02,431 --> 01:15:03,728
Hang on<i>,</i> here we go!

864
01:15:05,634 --> 01:15:08,865
.What the fuck are we gonna do now?
.Find a phone<i>,</i> call the cops.

865
01:15:08,971 --> 01:15:11,599
.What the fuck?
.Jesus H. Christ!

866
01:15:13,609 --> 01:15:14,735
Shit!

867
01:15:19,581 --> 01:15:21,276
Back to the warehouse!

868
01:15:31,727 --> 01:15:33,354
This way<i>,</i> you stupid honky!

869
01:15:33,795 --> 01:15:35,194
That's Spider.

870
01:15:39,167 --> 01:15:41,260
.Where is everybody?
.l don't know.

871
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:43,531
.Who's he?
.He owns this place.

872
01:15:44,406 --> 01:15:46,033
That fucking car is totaled.

873
01:15:46,141 --> 01:15:49,838
That's all right.
My car is still out there. So is Frank's.

874
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:52,747
Not anymore.

875
01:16:23,946 --> 01:16:25,504
Tina!

876
01:16:30,352 --> 01:16:31,717
Where are you?

877
01:16:49,438 --> 01:16:50,769
Forgive me.

878
01:17:40,956 --> 01:17:44,357
<i>Ground, this is Air 4, we got</i>
<i>a bad situation. We got officers down.</i>

879
01:17:44,459 --> 01:17:46,654
<i>We have just witnessed</i>
<i>ground units attacked.</i>

880
01:17:47,763 --> 01:17:49,094
Helicopter!

881
01:17:49,498 --> 01:17:52,729
<i>Attention. This is the police.</i>

882
01:17:52,834 --> 01:17:55,394
<i>This area is under police blockade.</i>

883
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:59,065
<i>All persons within this area wishing</i>
<i>to surrender should make their way...</i>

884
01:17:59,174 --> 01:18:01,267
<i>...to the perimeter at once.</i>

885
01:18:01,977 --> 01:18:03,137
Jesus.

886
01:18:03,745 --> 01:18:06,339
lt sounds like the shit's
hitting the fan out there.

887
01:18:06,448 --> 01:18:09,246
.We got to let them know we're here.
.You better believe it.

888
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:10,784
Hey<i>,</i> mister!

889
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:13,417
Don't go in there.

890
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:16,423
There's a thing in there.
lt ripped out the phone.

891
01:18:17,025 --> 01:18:18,583
There's another in the basement.

892
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:21,026
The basement's fucked!
You know what's in there?

893
01:18:21,129 --> 01:18:23,256
.What do you mean?
.One of those corpses.

894
01:18:23,365 --> 01:18:25,925
A real ugly one<i>,</i> all black and slimy.

895
01:18:26,301 --> 01:18:29,429
l don't care what's in the basement<i>,</i>
we got to get to that phone.

896
01:18:29,538 --> 01:18:32,564
Blinding them seems to work okay<i>,</i>
doesn't it?

897
01:18:33,775 --> 01:18:35,367
Wait a minute.

898
01:18:37,212 --> 01:18:41,672
Spider<i>,</i> open the door.
l'm going to knock his goddamn block off.

899
01:18:43,285 --> 01:18:47,585
lt was wrong for you to lock me up.
l had to hurt myself to get out.

900
01:18:48,190 --> 01:18:50,249
But l forgive you<i>,</i> darling.

901
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:52,917
And l know you're here...

902
01:18:53,228 --> 01:18:55,890
...because l can smell your brains.

903
01:18:57,299 --> 01:18:58,596
Go away!

904
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:00,531
l'm coming up<i>,</i> Tina.

905
01:19:15,016 --> 01:19:17,450
Now you made me hurt myself again.

906
01:19:17,953 --> 01:19:21,480
You made me break my hand
completely off this time<i>,</i> Tina.

907
01:19:23,125 --> 01:19:25,320
But l don't care<i>,</i> darling...

908
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:27,524
...because l love you.

909
01:19:28,330 --> 01:19:32,858
You've got to let me eat your brain.

910
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:47,415
Open the goddamn door.

911
01:19:52,487 --> 01:19:53,920
Brains!

912
01:19:57,726 --> 01:19:59,421
Get him down.

913
01:19:59,528 --> 01:20:03,430
All right<i>,</i> you guys<i>,</i> go.
Get in there<i>,</i> come on<i>,</i> fast. Get in!

914
01:20:08,336 --> 01:20:10,201
Watch it<i>,</i> the step's out.

915
01:20:17,512 --> 01:20:19,275
Jesus Christ.

916
01:20:21,950 --> 01:20:24,714
That's our friend. The Tarman got him.

917
01:20:33,195 --> 01:20:34,753
Give me the police.

918
01:20:35,530 --> 01:20:36,997

.Yes<i>,</i> go ahead.
.You've got to help us.

921
01:20:46,708 --> 01:20:49,802
There's a bunch of us inside your barricade<i>,</i>
and we can't get out.

922
01:20:49,911 --> 01:20:52,505
First of all<i>,</i>
what the hell is going on in there?

923
01:20:52,614 --> 01:20:55,640
l lost a do<i>z</i>en good men<i>,</i>
and nobody can tell me jack shit.

924
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:58,776
There are people in the cemetery
who are stark<i>,</i> staring mad.

925
01:20:58,887 --> 01:21:00,411
They'll kill you and eat you.

926
01:21:00,522 --> 01:21:03,082
lt's like a disease<i>,</i> it's like rabies<i>,</i>
only faster.

927
01:21:03,191 --> 01:21:06,752
That's why you got to come in here
and get us out now. Please.

928
01:21:07,195 --> 01:21:10,323
Just a minute<i>,</i> l can't hear.
There's a lot of noise out here.

929
01:21:10,432 --> 01:21:12,627
What the hell's going on?

930
01:21:12,834 --> 01:21:15,166

They got the cops.

934
01:21:42,464 --> 01:21:46,059
That means they're breaking out
of the barricade. Jesus Christ.

935
01:21:53,174 --> 01:21:54,801
What's he doing?

936
01:21:55,977 --> 01:21:57,672
What are you doing?

937
01:22:04,753 --> 01:22:05,879
<i>Hello?</i>

938
01:22:07,055 --> 01:22:09,649
l'm calling the number
stenciled on the tank.

939
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:12,727

Mr. Wilson<i>,</i> where are you calling from?

950
01:22:47,929 --> 01:22:50,591
l see. When did this take place?

951
01:22:51,666 --> 01:22:54,226
And when was the tank first breached?

952
01:22:55,170 --> 01:22:57,730
Why didn't you call
this number immediately?

953
01:22:58,573 --> 01:23:01,770
l see. lt's understandable.
What happened next?

954
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:07,813
You did? And what effect did that have?

955
01:23:11,886 --> 01:23:13,683
What did you do then?

956
01:23:16,091 --> 01:23:17,854
And what did they do?

957
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:20,020
l see.

958
01:23:22,230 --> 01:23:23,458
Really?

959
01:23:24,165 --> 01:23:25,996
How many did you say?

960
01:23:27,135 --> 01:23:30,400
And how many acres
does this cemetery cover<i>,</i> sir?

961
01:23:31,239 --> 01:23:32,331
Yes.

962
01:23:33,475 --> 01:23:34,635

Yes<i>,</i> l see.

964
01:23:37,612 --> 01:23:40,740
Of course. Thank you
for your assistance<i>,</i> Mr. Wilson.

965
01:23:40,849 --> 01:23:43,647
l'll switch you back to Capt. Turner.
He'll talk to you.

966
01:24:14,182 --> 01:24:16,412
Sir<i>,</i> this is Col. Glover.

967
01:24:16,751 --> 01:24:20,619
l'm sorry to disturb you at this hour<i>,</i>
but we're at Q.2 status.

968
01:24:20,855 --> 01:24:24,723
lt looks like we've found
that lost consignment of Easter eggs.

969
01:24:27,162 --> 01:24:30,723
Yes<i>,</i> sir<i>,</i> pretty sure.
They've turned up in Louisville.

970
01:24:30,832 --> 01:24:35,235
l'm getting confirmations on this
from the Louisville Police Department.

971
01:24:35,336 --> 01:24:37,327
Louisville<i>,</i> Kentucky<i>,</i> sir.

972
01:24:39,107 --> 01:24:43,305
lt would be good news<i>,</i>
except that the eggs have hatched.

973
01:24:43,545 --> 01:24:45,069
What are they doing?

974
01:24:45,180 --> 01:24:46,909
Hang on a second<i>,</i> would you?

975
01:24:47,015 --> 01:24:50,849
lt's weird. These people seem to say
they've been waiting for this to happen.

976
01:24:50,952 --> 01:24:54,285
Apparently<i>,</i> they've got some sort of
contingency plan to deal with it.

977
01:24:54,389 --> 01:24:57,222
.That's great!
.What is this plan?

978
01:24:59,127 --> 01:25:03,587

Very close to optimal placement.

992
01:26:19,607 --> 01:26:22,132
Only 20 square blocks destroyed.

993
01:26:22,243 --> 01:26:24,143
<i>Less than 4,000 dead, General.</i>

994
01:26:24,245 --> 01:26:29,239
<i>l wouldn't worry about the fires, General.</i>
<i>The rain is taking care of that right now.</i>

995
01:26:29,651 --> 01:26:33,348
<i>There have been complaints</i>
<i>about burning skin, but l shouldn't worry.</i>

996
01:26:33,454 --> 01:26:37,322
<i>Minor irritation, General.</i>
<i>The rain will wash everything away.</i>

997

<i>That's correct, sir.</i>
<i>All should be back to normal by morning.</i>

998

<i>l understand the President</i>
<i>will visit Louisville tomorrow.</i>

999
01:26:44,599 --> 01:26:47,500
<i>No, we wouldn't want that to happen, sir.</i>

1000
01:26:47,702 --> 01:26:50,637
<i>No, this hasn't been</i>
<i>very pleasant for anyone.</i>

1001
01:26:51,739 --> 01:26:53,934
<i>Thank you, sir. Goodnight, sir.</i>

1002
01:27:09,257 --> 01:27:10,815

01:27:24,539 --> 01:27:26,268
Burt? Frank.

We have a little problem.

You mean the movie lied?

1023
01:28:16,958 --> 01:28:19,153
<i>lt's not a bad question.</i>
