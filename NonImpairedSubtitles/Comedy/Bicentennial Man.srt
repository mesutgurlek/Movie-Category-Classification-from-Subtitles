1
00:05:43,417 --> 00:05:45,692
-Nice place.
-l've seen better.

2
00:05:58,977 --> 00:06:00,490
Everybody downstairs.

3
00:06:04,217 --> 00:06:05,889
-Good afternoon.
-Afternoon, sir.

4
00:06:05,977 --> 00:06:08,286
-Where do you want this?
-Just through there.

5
00:06:08,377 --> 00:06:10,368
Come on, you guys. l've got a surprise.

6
00:06:10,457 --> 00:06:13,927
Want to place him right over here, sir?
Here's a place.

7
00:06:14,377 --> 00:06:15,810
Move it over here.

8
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:23,413
Sweetie, come away from it, please.

9
00:06:25,737 --> 00:06:27,534
-What is it, Daddy?
-Wait.

10
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:59,447
Thank you, sir. Enjoy your NDR.

11
00:07:14,257 --> 00:07:17,852
North Am Robotics,
household model, NDR-114.

12
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,928
Serial number 583625.

13
00:07:28,137 --> 00:07:29,047
Hello.

14
00:07:30,297 --> 00:07:31,173
Hello.

15
00:07:34,137 --> 00:07:35,650
Are you one's family?

16
00:07:38,497 --> 00:07:39,612
l guess so.

17
00:07:49,217 --> 00:07:52,334
-lt's scary.
-lt's not scary. lt's stupid.

18
00:07:52,857 --> 00:07:54,006
l doubt that.

19
00:07:54,097 --> 00:07:57,248
Jenny Harrison's family's got one.
So did Kate McCalister.

20
00:07:57,937 --> 00:07:59,893
-They're all the same.
-What is it?

21
00:07:59,977 --> 00:08:01,296
lt's an android.

22
00:08:01,697 --> 00:08:03,050
What's an Andrew?

23
00:08:05,697 --> 00:08:07,335
Will that be one's name?

24
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:08,726
Why not?

25
00:08:09,257 --> 00:08:10,406
Sounds good.

26
00:08:11,217 --> 00:08:12,286
Hello, Andrew.

27
00:08:12,377 --> 00:08:13,492
Hello, Sir.

28
00:08:14,337 --> 00:08:16,407
Care to hear
''The Three Laws of Robotics''?

29
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:19,057
lt's said to be a most
entertaining presentation.

30
00:08:19,777 --> 00:08:20,732
Sure.

31
00:08:21,057 --> 00:08:23,855
Will you step back, Sir,
to maximise presentation?

32
00:08:37,857 --> 00:08:39,415
First Law of Robotics:

33
00:08:39,577 --> 00:08:42,250
A robot may not injure a human being...

34
00:08:42,457 --> 00:08:45,767
...or, through inaction,
cause a human being to come to harm.

35
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:48,256
Second Law:

36
00:08:48,697 --> 00:08:51,211
A robot must obey all human orders...

37
00:08:51,617 --> 00:08:55,212
...except where those orders
come in conflict with the first law.

38
00:08:55,617 --> 00:08:56,652
Third Law:

39
00:08:56,737 --> 00:08:59,535
A robot must protect itself
so long as doing so...

40
00:08:59,737 --> 00:09:02,774
...does not conflict with the first two laws.

41
00:09:08,097 --> 00:09:10,167
Andrew, don't ever do that again.

42
00:09:10,777 --> 00:09:13,291
Of course not, Sir. lt is a one-time only.

43
00:09:14,377 --> 00:09:17,255
There is another option
that one is obligated to point out.

44
00:09:17,337 --> 00:09:19,897
You may have one
with or without personality.

45
00:09:20,057 --> 00:09:22,651
Would you care to see a demo
of the personality chip?

46
00:09:22,737 --> 00:09:24,967
No, thank you.
We'll stick with what we've got.

47
00:09:25,057 --> 00:09:27,287
A wise choice, Sir, if one may say so.

48
00:09:27,577 --> 00:09:29,647
Well, you'll be staying down here.

49
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:31,736
Got everything you need?

50
00:09:31,817 --> 00:09:34,206
One only requires access to a power outlet.

51
00:09:34,297 --> 00:09:35,173
Good.

52
00:09:38,497 --> 00:09:39,930
Good night, Andrew.

53
00:09:40,337 --> 00:09:41,850
lt certainly is, Sir.

54
00:09:43,017 --> 00:09:47,215
No, Andrew, the correct response
to ''Good night'' is ''Good night.''

55
00:09:48,417 --> 00:09:50,328
-Good night.
-Yes.

56
00:09:50,937 --> 00:09:52,450
You just said, ''Yes.''

57
00:09:53,617 --> 00:09:56,768
But the correct response to ''Good night''
is ''Good night.''

58
00:09:57,657 --> 00:09:59,887
-Good night, Andrew.
-Good night, Sir.

59
00:10:01,857 --> 00:10:04,087
-Good night, Andrew.
-Good night, Sir.

60
00:10:04,977 --> 00:10:06,535
You only need to say it once.

61
00:10:06,617 --> 00:10:08,767
Or one would be saying it forever, Sir.

62
00:10:08,857 --> 00:10:10,609
ln an infinite verbal loop.

63
00:10:11,137 --> 00:10:12,126
Exactly.

64
00:10:13,017 --> 00:10:14,245
Thank you, Sir.

65
00:10:14,537 --> 00:10:15,413
Good.

66
00:10:15,737 --> 00:10:16,647
Night.

67
00:10:19,537 --> 00:10:20,652
Sorry, Sir.

68
00:11:02,657 --> 00:11:06,696
Honey, l don't want it following me
around the house all day.

69
00:11:06,977 --> 00:11:08,490
Can't you turn it off?

70
00:11:08,857 --> 00:11:10,415
Just give him a job.

71
00:11:11,977 --> 00:11:13,205
You'll be okay.

72
00:11:14,177 --> 00:11:15,292
Seat belts.

73
00:11:16,537 --> 00:11:20,371
Good morning, Mr. Martin. Today's
temperature will be in the high 70s.

74
00:11:20,457 --> 00:11:21,446
Bye, Mom!

75
00:11:22,097 --> 00:11:25,453
-Have a good day, sweethearts!
-Have a good day, sweethearts!

76
00:12:57,737 --> 00:13:00,376
-Andrew, this is very good.
-Thank you, Sir.

77
00:13:00,537 --> 00:13:02,687
-Don't you think?
-l think it sucks.

78
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:06,531
Sucks? How? Chickens do not have lips.

79
00:13:09,097 --> 00:13:10,450
She's being rude.

80
00:13:10,537 --> 00:13:12,971
You mind your manners,
young lady, please.

81
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:16,452
We're fine.

82
00:13:17,217 --> 00:13:18,730
lndeed, you are, Sir.

83
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:21,406
The kitchen.

84
00:13:23,217 --> 00:13:24,696
lt's fine too, Sir.

85
00:13:25,377 --> 00:13:28,050
No. Go to the kitchen now.

86
00:13:42,257 --> 00:13:43,167
Hello.

87
00:13:52,257 --> 00:13:53,372
Come on.

88
00:14:04,537 --> 00:14:05,890
lt's a big bluff.

89
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:12,335
Just a pretty face.

90
00:14:29,617 --> 00:14:30,527
Check.

91
00:14:32,737 --> 00:14:35,376
Andrew, could you come up?

92
00:14:39,857 --> 00:14:41,848
-Should l?
-lt'll be fine.

93
00:14:48,457 --> 00:14:49,526
Yes, Miss?

94
00:14:50,017 --> 00:14:52,087
Would you please open the window?

95
00:14:52,217 --> 00:14:54,094
One is glad to be of service.

96
00:15:01,737 --> 00:15:03,056
A lovely breeze.

97
00:15:04,097 --> 00:15:05,132
Now jump.

98
00:15:08,577 --> 00:15:09,771
No.

99
00:15:11,017 --> 00:15:12,245
Out the window.

100
00:15:20,537 --> 00:15:23,290
-Did you hear something?
-Was that an earthquake?

101
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:45,654
Sorry for the inconvenience.

102
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:48,297
May one reenter?

103
00:15:48,817 --> 00:15:49,966
What happened?

104
00:15:50,057 --> 00:15:52,617
For the sake of family harmony...

105
00:15:52,697 --> 00:15:56,087
...one is programmed not to tell.

106
00:16:06,497 --> 00:16:07,725
Amanda! Grace!

107
00:16:08,057 --> 00:16:09,615
Downstairs right away.

108
00:16:11,417 --> 00:16:14,454
-Come in, Andrew.
-Thank you, Sir.

109
00:16:30,297 --> 00:16:32,891
Andrew is not a person.
He is a form of property.

110
00:16:32,977 --> 00:16:34,695
One is not a....

111
00:16:38,617 --> 00:16:40,573
But property is also important.

112
00:16:41,217 --> 00:16:43,731
So from now on, as a matter of principle...

113
00:16:43,977 --> 00:16:47,492
...in this family, Andrew will be treated
as if he were a person.

114
00:16:48,937 --> 00:16:51,405
There will be no more attempts
to break him.

115
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,132
Break him?

116
00:16:53,217 --> 00:16:55,856
Your sister tried to kill Andrew.

117
00:16:59,137 --> 00:17:00,126
You, too?

118
00:17:02,257 --> 00:17:03,292
Sorry.

119
00:17:05,097 --> 00:17:06,974
Come on. Everyone up to bed.

120
00:17:09,657 --> 00:17:11,215
Will you be all right?

121
00:17:11,457 --> 00:17:13,846
One is capable of self-maintenance, Sir.

122
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:15,493
Good.

123
00:17:16,737 --> 00:17:19,126
-Good night, Andrew.
-Good night, Andrew.

124
00:17:53,177 --> 00:17:56,613
Miss! One has been given specific
orders for your safety...

125
00:17:57,257 --> 00:18:00,693
...and that is an unsafe area.
Now come down!

126
00:18:02,177 --> 00:18:03,053
Okay.

127
00:18:04,177 --> 00:18:05,246
Thank you.

128
00:18:06,177 --> 00:18:08,611
''l think it's going to be sunny tonight.''

129
00:18:08,737 --> 00:18:09,886
''Me too!''

130
00:18:11,897 --> 00:18:12,966
''So do l.''

131
00:18:20,137 --> 00:18:21,490
He's my favourite.

132
00:18:23,377 --> 00:18:24,332
Pretty.

133
00:18:25,377 --> 00:18:27,129
Would you like to hold him?

134
00:18:37,777 --> 00:18:39,290
That was my favourite.

135
00:18:42,297 --> 00:18:44,367
They don't even make him anymore.

136
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,890
Can it be repaired?

137
00:18:47,217 --> 00:18:48,411
No, it can't!

138
00:18:49,137 --> 00:18:50,365
You're screwed!

139
00:18:50,737 --> 00:18:51,852
l hate you.

140
00:18:53,137 --> 00:18:54,536
Get away from me.

141
00:19:01,137 --> 00:19:02,365
Can we fix him?

142
00:19:02,497 --> 00:19:06,888
No. Look at him.
He's in a million pieces. l'm sorry.

143
00:19:08,977 --> 00:19:10,729
There's nothing you can do.

144
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:05,890
Yes, Little Miss?

145
00:20:06,337 --> 00:20:08,692
This is the best present l ever got.

146
00:20:10,297 --> 00:20:12,174
One is glad to be of service.

147
00:20:12,817 --> 00:20:14,728
Would you please come with me?

148
00:20:16,457 --> 00:20:18,209
Does this involve a window?

149
00:20:18,737 --> 00:20:19,567
No.

150
00:20:26,137 --> 00:20:27,490
You can sit here.

151
00:20:35,097 --> 00:20:36,496
His name is Woofy.

152
00:20:37,657 --> 00:20:41,127
And from now on he's yours.

153
00:20:44,657 --> 00:20:45,646
Woofy.

154
00:20:46,937 --> 00:20:48,689
Because sometimes he barks.

155
00:20:52,057 --> 00:20:53,729
Once he gets to know you.

156
00:20:58,777 --> 00:21:00,529
Thank you very much.

157
00:21:01,417 --> 00:21:02,645
You're welcome.

158
00:21:03,217 --> 00:21:05,287
l have to go to sleep now, Andrew.

159
00:21:06,937 --> 00:21:07,767
Yes.

160
00:21:08,417 --> 00:21:10,408
Can you kind of....

161
00:21:11,817 --> 00:21:12,886
Of course.

162
00:21:20,017 --> 00:21:21,655
Good night, sweetheart.

163
00:21:22,217 --> 00:21:23,650
Good night, Andrew.

164
00:21:41,417 --> 00:21:43,533
-Little Miss.
-Sure. Thanks.

165
00:21:43,617 --> 00:21:44,493
Miss?

166
00:21:50,217 --> 00:21:52,128
-After you.
-Thank you.

167
00:21:52,217 --> 00:21:53,445
You're welcome.

168
00:21:55,937 --> 00:21:58,007
Andrew, did you really make this?

169
00:21:58,897 --> 00:21:59,932
Yes, Sir.

170
00:22:02,577 --> 00:22:04,647
A robot cannot tell a lie, Andrew.

171
00:22:04,937 --> 00:22:07,007
That is not entirely correct, Sir.

172
00:22:07,137 --> 00:22:09,253
One could lie if one were ordered to lie...

173
00:22:09,337 --> 00:22:12,807
...or if it were necessary in order
to keep a human being from harm...

174
00:22:12,897 --> 00:22:14,649
...or for one's own safety.

175
00:22:16,137 --> 00:22:18,605
One did indeed carve that for Little Miss.

176
00:22:19,617 --> 00:22:22,450
-And you're responsible for the design?
-Yes, Sir.

177
00:22:22,897 --> 00:22:24,615
What did you copy it from?

178
00:22:25,457 --> 00:22:26,731
Copy it, ma'am?

179
00:22:28,697 --> 00:22:30,927
You didn't just get it out of thin air.

180
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:34,771
You got it out of some book,
or you used the computer to plot it out.

181
00:22:35,737 --> 00:22:38,934
One did nothing more than study
the raw material for a time...

182
00:22:39,017 --> 00:22:42,293
...until one came to understand
how best to carve it into a shape...

183
00:22:42,377 --> 00:22:45,574
...that would appeal to Little Miss'
love of tiny mammals.

184
00:24:30,697 --> 00:24:32,494
Yes, please, come in.

185
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:37,845
l'm so glad you called. Mansky.
Dennis Mansky.

186
00:24:38,177 --> 00:24:39,405
Richard Martin.

187
00:24:40,657 --> 00:24:43,125
And an NDR-114.

188
00:24:44,257 --> 00:24:47,772
Now, l got your message
but what exactly is it doing?

189
00:24:49,857 --> 00:24:54,977
What interests me is he shows a number
of characteristics like creativity...

190
00:24:55,177 --> 00:25:00,376
...curiosity, friendship that, frankly,
have taken us by surprise.

191
00:25:03,577 --> 00:25:05,488
-Andrew.
-Yes, Dennis?

192
00:25:06,777 --> 00:25:08,096
Social, as well.

193
00:25:09,217 --> 00:25:11,811
Now, l'd like to show you something,
if l may.

194
00:25:13,737 --> 00:25:15,295
Andrew carved these.

195
00:25:16,657 --> 00:25:18,773
These are original works of art.

196
00:25:20,017 --> 00:25:23,407
And last night Andrew said,
''l enjoy making them.''

197
00:25:24,297 --> 00:25:25,286
''Enjoy''?

198
00:25:25,817 --> 00:25:29,014
-Should one not use that word?
-No, it's fine, Andrew.

199
00:25:29,097 --> 00:25:33,409
You see what l mean? lt's unusual to hear
a robot talk about enjoying something.

200
00:25:34,017 --> 00:25:39,011
What l want to know is, do many of your
other robots have feelings like this?

201
00:25:41,657 --> 00:25:44,774
Must be something in the pathways.

202
00:25:48,857 --> 00:25:51,849
So then, will you be wanting a refund
or a replacement?

203
00:25:53,297 --> 00:25:56,255
Neither. l just wanted to get
your reaction to Andrew.

204
00:25:56,337 --> 00:25:59,613
l want to know what you think.
He's unique, wouldn't you say?

205
00:25:59,697 --> 00:26:01,289
lt is an anomaly.

206
00:26:03,817 --> 00:26:05,569
No refund. No replacement.

207
00:26:07,137 --> 00:26:08,650
How much do you want?

208
00:26:10,657 --> 00:26:12,409
l don't think l understand.

209
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:16,974
Clearly you realise if word of this gets out,
we'll have to recall our entire line.

210
00:26:17,817 --> 00:26:20,615
We're in people's homes, sir,
with their children.

211
00:26:20,817 --> 00:26:23,729
lf it is doing what you say,
it can also run amuck.

212
00:26:24,657 --> 00:26:26,727
One is not qualified to run mucks.

213
00:26:28,297 --> 00:26:31,448
All right, sir. lf l let you have Andrew,
you'll what?

214
00:26:31,537 --> 00:26:33,607
You'll disassemble him, will you?

215
00:26:34,897 --> 00:26:39,846
Carefully, yes. We would need to trace
the course of Andrew's neural pathways...

216
00:26:40,497 --> 00:26:43,136
...replace the positronic brain and...

217
00:26:43,817 --> 00:26:44,966
...put it...

218
00:26:45,577 --> 00:26:48,967
...him back together
and return him to you good as new.

219
00:26:50,537 --> 00:26:53,335
Now, these neural pathways are
presumably fragile.

220
00:26:53,537 --> 00:26:56,176
lsn't it possible,
in the course of these procedures...

221
00:26:56,257 --> 00:26:58,327
...that something might go wrong?

222
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:01,886
We would make every conceivable effort.

223
00:27:02,457 --> 00:27:06,894
ln the unlikely event that something did go
wrong you'd, of course, replace Andrew.

224
00:27:07,097 --> 00:27:08,166
Of course.

225
00:27:09,617 --> 00:27:12,085
Even though he's unique and irreplaceable.

226
00:27:13,977 --> 00:27:15,808
''He.'' ''His.''

227
00:27:18,097 --> 00:27:21,294
lt's a natural error. lt has human form,
therefore you...

228
00:27:21,777 --> 00:27:25,611
...read mechanical failure
as eccentricity and anthropomorphise it.

229
00:27:27,377 --> 00:27:31,370
lt is a household appliance
and yet you act like it is a man.

230
00:27:32,337 --> 00:27:34,009
We're leaving. Come on, Andrew.

231
00:27:34,097 --> 00:27:36,657
Please, l beg you to reconsider, Mr. Martin.

232
00:27:36,737 --> 00:27:40,047
Let us examine Andrew.
Talk to your wife. Name your price!

233
00:27:41,417 --> 00:27:42,770
Now listen to me.

234
00:27:42,977 --> 00:27:45,172
There is no price for individuality.

235
00:27:45,257 --> 00:27:47,691
He is for better or for worse, my robot...

236
00:27:48,577 --> 00:27:51,933
...and you'll never lay your hands on him.
Do you understand?

237
00:27:54,377 --> 00:27:55,526
All in good time.

238
00:27:55,617 --> 00:27:59,087
You see sooner or later,
you'll have to bring it in for repairs.

239
00:28:06,457 --> 00:28:08,573
-l've made a decision.
-Yes, Sir?

240
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,689
You will cut back on your workload.

241
00:28:10,777 --> 00:28:14,565
You can no longer devote yourself
entirely to children and housework.

242
00:28:15,177 --> 00:28:18,965
But one likes the children, Sir.
Specifically, the smaller one, Little Miss.

243
00:28:19,057 --> 00:28:22,970
That is a contradiction and it is exactly
the sort of thing you need to learn.

244
00:28:23,057 --> 00:28:25,013
Thank you for choosing
North Am Robotics.

245
00:28:25,097 --> 00:28:27,327
-We need a new regimen.
-Regimen, Sir?

246
00:28:27,777 --> 00:28:31,133
First of all, you'll spend part of
each day making something.

247
00:28:31,777 --> 00:28:35,770
So as not to offend humans, we'll find
something that's not overly artistic.

248
00:28:35,857 --> 00:28:38,894
Could you make other things?
l can teach you my line of work.

249
00:28:38,977 --> 00:28:40,456
Timepieces and clocks.

250
00:28:40,537 --> 00:28:43,449
One could not tell you.
One has never attempted such things.

251
00:28:43,537 --> 00:28:44,731
You will now.

252
00:28:45,817 --> 00:28:49,412
Also, you'll spend part of each evening
in instruction with me.

253
00:28:49,617 --> 00:28:51,608
What is the purpose of this instruction?

254
00:28:51,697 --> 00:28:55,770
To teach you all the things
that haven't been programmed into you.

255
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:00,131
You're unique.

256
00:29:00,817 --> 00:29:01,693
Unique?

257
00:29:01,777 --> 00:29:03,688
Thank you for choosing
North Am Robotics.

258
00:29:03,777 --> 00:29:07,975
l feel a responsibility to help you
become whatever you're able to be.

259
00:29:08,137 --> 00:29:09,889
And what is one able to be?

260
00:29:10,577 --> 00:29:12,010
Well, l don't know.

261
00:29:12,577 --> 00:29:14,249
People grow through time.

262
00:29:14,737 --> 00:29:18,366
But for you, time is a completely
different proposition.

263
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:21,735
-For you, time is endless.
-Endless?

264
00:29:31,737 --> 00:29:33,614
-ls this a good piece?
-Very.

265
00:29:41,777 --> 00:29:44,052
-What about this one?
-Excellent.

266
00:30:20,657 --> 00:30:23,967
...and nine months later a baby is born.

267
00:30:26,337 --> 00:30:29,409
And those, Andrew,
are the so-called facts of life.

268
00:30:31,217 --> 00:30:33,890
People actually do this, Sir?

269
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:36,247
Yes.

270
00:30:36,657 --> 00:30:38,090
And married people.

271
00:30:38,377 --> 00:30:42,689
One supposes they see it as some
kind of requirement or obligation.

272
00:30:43,817 --> 00:30:47,127
Well, it's not exactly an obligation.

273
00:30:47,777 --> 00:30:49,005
That's a relief.

274
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:53,010
And it is the natural and preferable way
to conceive children.

275
00:30:53,217 --> 00:30:54,127
Sir?

276
00:30:54,657 --> 00:30:57,455
Of all these millions of sperm,
only one makes it?

277
00:30:58,977 --> 00:31:00,126
That's true.

278
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,569
What happens to the others?

279
00:31:04,977 --> 00:31:06,012
They die.

280
00:31:06,457 --> 00:31:07,492
They die?

281
00:31:09,577 --> 00:31:11,249
One feels badly for them.

282
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,765
Well, one does.

283
00:31:14,897 --> 00:31:16,888
lt's agreed that it feels good.

284
00:31:17,137 --> 00:31:19,731
-For both parties, Sir?
-ln an ideal world.

285
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:21,975
People do it frequently.

286
00:31:22,097 --> 00:31:23,291
How often, Sir?

287
00:31:23,377 --> 00:31:25,845
As often as they can, as a matter of fact.

288
00:31:28,257 --> 00:31:29,656
At least at first.

289
00:31:33,017 --> 00:31:33,847
Sir?

290
00:31:34,937 --> 00:31:38,054
-May one speak frankly with you?
-As always, Andrew.

291
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:41,813
lt's just that the whole process...

292
00:31:42,697 --> 00:31:44,972
...it sounds so messy.

293
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:49,608
l think that's a fair comment.

294
00:31:55,057 --> 00:31:56,046
They die.

295
00:32:31,497 --> 00:32:32,896
It's called humour.

296
00:32:33,897 --> 00:32:34,932
Humour?

297
00:32:35,657 --> 00:32:38,171
People tell jokes to make each other laugh.

298
00:32:39,017 --> 00:32:41,577
-And this laughter gives pleasure, Sir?
-Yes.

299
00:32:44,177 --> 00:32:46,293
Could you teach one to tell a joke?

300
00:32:49,337 --> 00:32:50,531
Let's see....

301
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:54,448
Two drunks walk into a bar--

302
00:32:54,617 --> 00:32:57,370
Wouldn't two drunks
walk out of a bar, Sir?

303
00:32:58,057 --> 00:33:01,572
You walk into a bar to drink,
and you come out drunk.

304
00:33:03,297 --> 00:33:07,609
Let's try something simpler, Andrew.
Knock-knock.

305
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:10,886
Knock-knock.

306
00:33:11,057 --> 00:33:13,525
No. Knock-knock, someone's at the door.

307
00:33:14,017 --> 00:33:15,245
Shall one get it, Sir?

308
00:33:15,337 --> 00:33:18,215
No, you say, ''Who's there?'' Andrew.

309
00:33:18,897 --> 00:33:21,570
-''Who's there, Andrew?''
-No. Just, ''Who's there?''

310
00:33:21,657 --> 00:33:23,295
One does not know, Sir.

311
00:33:25,097 --> 00:33:27,611
We'll start with something a little simpler.

312
00:33:28,337 --> 00:33:30,453
Why did the chicken cross the road?

313
00:33:30,537 --> 00:33:33,768
One does not know. Possibly a predator
was behind the chicken.

314
00:33:33,857 --> 00:33:37,247
Or possibly there was a female chicken
on the other side of the road...

315
00:33:37,337 --> 00:33:40,534
...if it was a male chicken or,
depending on the season...

316
00:33:40,817 --> 00:33:43,854
...it might be migrating.
One hopes there's no traffic.

317
00:33:44,377 --> 00:33:46,413
To get to the other side.

318
00:33:47,337 --> 00:33:49,089
''To get to the other side.''

319
00:33:51,977 --> 00:33:53,376
Why is that funny?

320
00:33:56,857 --> 00:33:58,848
What do you kids have planned for today?

321
00:33:58,937 --> 00:34:01,246
l'll probably stick around
with Andrew today.

322
00:34:01,337 --> 00:34:02,565
What about you?

323
00:34:02,657 --> 00:34:05,046
l'm going to go play
at my friend Natalie's house.

324
00:34:07,977 --> 00:34:10,810
May one, Sir? ls now a good time?

325
00:34:12,697 --> 00:34:14,528
What? A good time for what?

326
00:34:15,017 --> 00:34:18,453
-Last night, Sir taught--
-No. Don't blame me, just go ahead.

327
00:34:18,977 --> 00:34:20,171
Thank you, Sir.

328
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:25,572
Two cannibals were eating a clown.
One says, ''Does this taste funny to you?''

329
00:34:25,657 --> 00:34:28,217
How do you make a hanky dance?
Put a little boogie in it.

330
00:34:28,297 --> 00:34:30,572
What's a brunette between two blondes?
Translator.

331
00:34:30,657 --> 00:34:33,012
Why don't the blind skydive?
lt scares their dogs.

332
00:34:33,097 --> 00:34:36,487
A man with dementia is driving on
the freeway. His wife calls and says:

333
00:34:36,577 --> 00:34:38,772
''l heard there's someone driving
the wrong way.''

334
00:34:38,857 --> 00:34:40,449
He says, ''One? There's hundreds!''

335
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:43,609
What's silent, smells like worms?
Bird farts.

336
00:34:44,057 --> 00:34:46,252
An engineer must have designed
the human body.

337
00:34:46,337 --> 00:34:50,125
Who else would put a waste-processing
plant next to a recreation area?

338
00:34:50,337 --> 00:34:53,613
A woman goes to a doctor who says,
''Mind if l numb your breasts?''

339
00:34:53,697 --> 00:34:55,608
''Not at all.''
''Num, num, num.''

340
00:34:58,537 --> 00:34:59,856
One did it, Sir.

341
00:35:00,417 --> 00:35:03,534
lt was fine, but we might want
to talk about...

342
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:06,571
...appropriateness and timing.

343
00:35:07,137 --> 00:35:08,456
lt's 10:15, Sir.

344
00:35:25,657 --> 00:35:28,171
Would you like me to teach you
how to play a duet?

345
00:35:28,257 --> 00:35:29,736
-Certainly.
-Come on.

346
00:35:33,337 --> 00:35:35,532
Okay, ready? You start here.

347
00:35:36,457 --> 00:35:39,369
And then just follow me. l play first.

348
00:35:39,977 --> 00:35:40,887
Ready?

349
00:35:48,377 --> 00:35:49,412
Your turn.

350
00:35:55,497 --> 00:35:56,373
Good.

351
00:35:57,137 --> 00:35:58,855
Very good. Now together.

352
00:37:00,257 --> 00:37:02,088
That was wonderful. Thanks.

353
00:37:02,217 --> 00:37:03,809
Thank you, Little Miss.

354
00:37:37,817 --> 00:37:38,806
Hi, Mom.

355
00:37:46,177 --> 00:37:50,136
Grace, is it possible for you to find
somewhere more private to do that?

356
00:37:51,137 --> 00:37:54,812
No problem. Give me your credit disk,
and we'll get a hotel room.

357
00:37:56,817 --> 00:37:58,455
What did you say to me?

358
00:37:58,657 --> 00:37:59,692
Let's go.

359
00:38:00,337 --> 00:38:02,293
What did you say to me, young lady?

360
00:38:02,377 --> 00:38:05,414
You get off that bike this minute,
and you are grounded!

361
00:38:05,497 --> 00:38:06,850
Go on, get out of here, you piece of scum!

362
00:38:18,777 --> 00:38:20,176
Does this look right?

363
00:38:20,257 --> 00:38:23,090
-Hi, Mom.
-Didn't you talk to her about that boy?

364
00:38:23,257 --> 00:38:25,248
Well, not yet. But l will.

365
00:38:26,617 --> 00:38:30,246
Kind of hoping it's a phase that'll pass,
like the others.

366
00:38:41,977 --> 00:38:44,889
l am so sick of these damned clocks!

367
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:48,287
l've already given half of them away.

368
00:38:49,977 --> 00:38:51,808
Perhaps we should sell them.

369
00:38:52,337 --> 00:38:53,406
Sell them?

370
00:38:53,537 --> 00:38:54,936
lt's an idea.

371
00:38:55,817 --> 00:38:57,250
Who gets the money?

372
00:38:57,657 --> 00:38:59,295
Well, l imagine we will.

373
00:39:00,017 --> 00:39:01,655
But Andrew does all the work.

374
00:39:01,737 --> 00:39:04,456
-But Andrew is our--
-Then Andrew should get the money.

375
00:39:04,537 --> 00:39:05,936
Andrew is a robot.

376
00:39:06,297 --> 00:39:09,209
What conceivable use would a robot
have for money?

377
00:39:09,857 --> 00:39:11,529
Robots don't go shopping.

378
00:39:11,617 --> 00:39:13,255
Robots don't go on vacations.

379
00:39:13,337 --> 00:39:15,931
Robots don't eat dinners
in fancy restaurants.

380
00:39:18,057 --> 00:39:20,651
l can't believe we're having this discussion.

381
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:27,369
lt doesn't matter what he is.

382
00:39:27,457 --> 00:39:30,210
Andrew deserves to benefit
from the work he does.

383
00:39:31,897 --> 00:39:33,091
Sweetheart....

384
00:39:35,257 --> 00:39:38,169
l will do what's right for Andrew,
of course l will.

385
00:39:39,257 --> 00:39:42,215
At the end of the day,
we are talking about a machine.

386
00:39:43,097 --> 00:39:46,089
You can't invest
your emotions in a machine.

387
00:40:07,577 --> 00:40:10,091
-There you are. How are you?
-Good morning.

388
00:40:10,177 --> 00:40:13,613
-This must be Andrew.
-Andrew, Bill Feingold, family lawyer.

389
00:40:15,217 --> 00:40:16,889
You own one of my clocks.

390
00:40:18,977 --> 00:40:22,287
This is one of my favourites.
Do you enjoy it?

391
00:40:23,057 --> 00:40:24,536
Yes, l do very much.

392
00:40:25,017 --> 00:40:27,690
l like the new office, Bill.
What floor are we on?

393
00:40:27,777 --> 00:40:28,971
Thirty-seventh.

394
00:40:31,257 --> 00:40:33,487
Andrew, come and have a look at this.

395
00:40:34,137 --> 00:40:35,570
No, thank you, Sir.

396
00:40:37,377 --> 00:40:38,412
-Sure?
-No.

397
00:40:41,057 --> 00:40:42,331
How can l help you?

398
00:40:42,417 --> 00:40:46,296
As you know, Andrew has earned a great
deal of money from his endeavours.

399
00:40:46,697 --> 00:40:49,848
And what he really wants
is to open his own bank account.

400
00:40:50,217 --> 00:40:52,447
A bank account in the name of a robot.

401
00:40:52,537 --> 00:40:54,016
Would that be legal?

402
00:40:54,857 --> 00:40:57,291
l couldn't say. There are no precedents.

403
00:40:58,057 --> 00:41:00,776
l don't think there's a law against it, but....

404
00:41:01,337 --> 00:41:05,125
Why do you want to give him a
bank account? What's he need money for?

405
00:41:06,737 --> 00:41:10,127
To pay for things which, otherwise,
Sir would have to pay for.

406
00:41:10,417 --> 00:41:12,487
One would like to pull one's own.

407
00:41:14,057 --> 00:41:15,012
Weight.

408
00:41:15,497 --> 00:41:16,691
For what, Sir?

409
00:41:25,937 --> 00:41:27,370
Yes, Little Miss.

410
00:41:31,417 --> 00:41:32,645
l'm so sorry.

411
00:41:35,617 --> 00:41:37,653
Not to worry. lt can be repaired.

412
00:41:50,497 --> 00:41:51,327
Left.

413
00:41:53,737 --> 00:41:55,728
Remember Frank, my boyfriend?

414
00:41:55,897 --> 00:41:58,491
Yes. The one your sister says
has a nice ass.

415
00:42:05,897 --> 00:42:08,092
Last night, he asked me to marry him.

416
00:42:10,217 --> 00:42:12,287
One gathers that is a good thing.

417
00:42:13,857 --> 00:42:15,495
l haven't said yes yet.

418
00:42:15,777 --> 00:42:17,176
So there is doubt.

419
00:42:17,297 --> 00:42:19,253
No. Frank is wonderful.

420
00:42:19,377 --> 00:42:23,848
He's handsome, he's reliable,
he's somebody l could spend my life with.

421
00:42:24,017 --> 00:42:27,248
-l could have children with him.
-Then what is the problem?

422
00:42:29,657 --> 00:42:30,567
Board?

423
00:42:31,137 --> 00:42:33,526
-No.
-Not him. There.

424
00:42:37,857 --> 00:42:41,930
l have this friend that's very special to me.

425
00:42:45,537 --> 00:42:49,894
And he's just so sweet and funny,
and whenever l'm with him...

426
00:42:51,417 --> 00:42:53,487
...l don't want to be with Frank.

427
00:42:53,617 --> 00:42:56,177
One can see that would create
a complication.

428
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:01,051
But the answer's staring you in the face.

429
00:43:03,857 --> 00:43:05,256
Marry your friend.

430
00:43:08,217 --> 00:43:09,093
What?

431
00:43:09,737 --> 00:43:11,375
Well, he's not....

432
00:43:15,257 --> 00:43:18,533
A relationship between us,
it would be impossible, really.

433
00:43:18,617 --> 00:43:20,733
-lt could never work out.
-Why?

434
00:43:21,937 --> 00:43:23,416
Because he's not....

435
00:43:25,097 --> 00:43:27,133
Because he'll never be....

436
00:43:29,577 --> 00:43:30,805
Yes?

437
00:43:37,337 --> 00:43:38,770
ls something wrong?

438
00:43:42,257 --> 00:43:43,133
No.

439
00:43:44,457 --> 00:43:46,527
Nothing is wrong. Nothing at all.

440
00:43:47,817 --> 00:43:49,648
Thank you for listening to me.

441
00:43:49,737 --> 00:43:51,568
One is glad to be of service.

442
00:43:55,737 --> 00:43:56,886
Little Miss?

443
00:43:58,297 --> 00:44:00,208
What will you do about Frank?

444
00:44:07,017 --> 00:44:08,769
Accept his proposal.

445
00:44:09,417 --> 00:44:10,486
Really?

446
00:44:12,337 --> 00:44:13,406
Humans....

447
00:44:20,537 --> 00:44:24,291
lt would mean so much to me
if you would be an usher at my wedding.

448
00:44:25,897 --> 00:44:28,889
One is unfamiliar with this term.
How does one ush?

449
00:44:30,017 --> 00:44:33,009
You help people to their seats.
You wear a tuxedo.

450
00:44:35,537 --> 00:44:37,175
One would wear clothing?

451
00:44:37,697 --> 00:44:38,607
Yes.

452
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:42,737
One has never been asked
to wear clothing.

453
00:44:44,777 --> 00:44:46,290
lt would be an honour.

454
00:44:47,857 --> 00:44:48,892
Great!

455
00:44:55,537 --> 00:44:57,175
One still is all thumbs.

456
00:45:02,777 --> 00:45:04,176
lnstalled what?

457
00:45:06,177 --> 00:45:07,496
An alarm.

458
00:45:08,217 --> 00:45:11,971
lf you try to enter Andrew's brain
while you're making this repair...

459
00:45:12,537 --> 00:45:14,448
...the police will be alerted.

460
00:45:15,577 --> 00:45:17,727
Also, you should probably know that...

461
00:45:17,817 --> 00:45:21,173
...if you injure Andrew's brain
or positronic pathways in any way...

462
00:45:21,657 --> 00:45:25,809
...my lawyer, the good Mr. Feingold,
will be happy to sue you.

463
00:45:26,737 --> 00:45:31,413
He will sue you for the lost value of
Andrew's income until the end of time.

464
00:45:34,017 --> 00:45:36,087
l think we understand each other.

465
00:45:36,937 --> 00:45:37,813
Good.

466
00:45:38,737 --> 00:45:41,092
Sir, one more item of business.

467
00:45:42,857 --> 00:45:46,213
As long as one is in the shop,
can you do work on one's face?

468
00:45:46,337 --> 00:45:48,453
One wishes to have more expression.

469
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:51,654
One has thoughts and feelings
that presently do not show.

470
00:45:52,297 --> 00:45:55,448
You want your thoughts and feelings
to show on your face?

471
00:45:55,777 --> 00:45:58,928
Yes, like the contempt that you are
showing me right now.

472
00:46:01,937 --> 00:46:04,451
We have done some experimentation.

473
00:46:05,017 --> 00:46:10,728
We are able to give robots superficial
responses which mimic human expression.

474
00:46:10,857 --> 00:46:13,212
One has read that there have been
NDR upgrades.

475
00:46:13,297 --> 00:46:16,255
Yes, we've worked up
a dozen experimental models...

476
00:46:16,337 --> 00:46:19,374
...with expression capabilities,
sleeker body types.

477
00:46:20,097 --> 00:46:23,851
We ran some market surveys
and decided not to go ahead with the line.

478
00:46:23,937 --> 00:46:24,926
Why not?

479
00:46:25,377 --> 00:46:27,129
Negative consumer reaction.

480
00:46:27,697 --> 00:46:32,771
There is a fear that robots will continue
to make the human work force obsolete.

481
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:38,535
Andrew has worked for me for 15 years.
No one will lose their job to him.

482
00:46:38,897 --> 00:46:43,129
Surely there's no concern performing
these modifications on an old-style robot?

483
00:46:43,977 --> 00:46:48,846
True. But procedures like that
would be prohibitively expensive.

484
00:46:49,217 --> 00:46:52,129
lt is understood that
you will attempt to rivet one.

485
00:46:52,817 --> 00:46:56,127
-''Screw,'' Andrew.
-Really? How much?

486
00:47:10,617 --> 00:47:12,847
That is roughly one's monthly salary.

487
00:47:15,017 --> 00:47:17,087
That's more than l make in a year.

488
00:47:18,697 --> 00:47:21,848
Not bad for, what did you call him
last time we were here?

489
00:47:21,937 --> 00:47:23,256
Household appliance.

490
00:47:23,337 --> 00:47:25,851
-Household appliance?
-Household appliance, yes.

491
00:47:30,217 --> 00:47:32,777
May the peace of the Lord
be with you always.

492
00:47:34,097 --> 00:47:36,770
l now pronounce you husband and wife.

493
00:47:39,257 --> 00:47:41,009
You may kiss the bride now.

494
00:47:51,257 --> 00:47:55,330
lt is my pleasure to present
Mr. and Mrs. Frank Charney.

495
00:49:14,857 --> 00:49:16,495
Good evening, Sir.

496
00:49:19,617 --> 00:49:21,255
Magnificent night.

497
00:49:23,497 --> 00:49:25,931
You look very sharp this evening, Andrew.

498
00:49:26,337 --> 00:49:27,565
Thank you, Sir.

499
00:49:28,457 --> 00:49:30,846
lt was quite challenging for the tailor.

500
00:49:31,657 --> 00:49:35,013
May one continue wearing clothing,
if it suits you?

501
00:49:35,857 --> 00:49:37,176
Are you serious?

502
00:49:37,457 --> 00:49:38,685
As always.

503
00:49:40,377 --> 00:49:41,810
Well, l suppose so.

504
00:49:42,177 --> 00:49:45,965
We'll have to find you some other stuff.
You can't wear tails all the time.

505
00:49:46,057 --> 00:49:48,207
Really? How sad.

506
00:49:49,897 --> 00:49:52,411
-Sit down, Andrew, please.
-Thank you, Sir.

507
00:49:59,377 --> 00:50:01,254
lt was a wonderful wedding, wasn't it?

508
00:50:01,337 --> 00:50:02,486
Oh, yes, Sir.

509
00:50:03,057 --> 00:50:06,333
And, if one may say,
you are a spectacular dancer.

510
00:50:07,257 --> 00:50:08,451
That's very kind.

511
00:50:08,537 --> 00:50:10,573
Not at all, Sir. lt's the truth.

512
00:50:13,057 --> 00:50:14,695
Did you record the day?

513
00:50:15,097 --> 00:50:17,611
Every second, Sir, is in one's memory bank.

514
00:50:18,377 --> 00:50:20,333
Well, let's watch it, shall we?

515
00:51:15,937 --> 00:51:17,575
ls everything all right?

516
00:51:25,537 --> 00:51:27,448
They've both gone now, Andrew.

517
00:51:29,817 --> 00:51:32,012
Things change. Things always change.

518
00:51:32,097 --> 00:51:35,373
People move on, as it should be.

519
00:51:40,657 --> 00:51:42,773
But what l realised today is that...

520
00:51:45,457 --> 00:51:47,448
...l'll never stop missing them.

521
00:51:58,417 --> 00:51:59,816
One is still here.

522
00:52:01,697 --> 00:52:03,892
One is glad of that, Andrew.

523
00:52:05,057 --> 00:52:06,092
Thank you.

524
00:52:06,937 --> 00:52:09,371
-Good night, Sir.
-Good night, Andrew.

525
00:52:30,337 --> 00:52:32,293
Lloyd! Come here!

526
00:52:33,697 --> 00:52:37,576
What did l tell you about throwing sand
at people? What did l tell you?

527
00:52:38,417 --> 00:52:40,055
Now apologise to Andrew.

528
00:52:40,337 --> 00:52:42,293
l will not apologise to it.

529
00:52:42,817 --> 00:52:43,966
-Him.
-lt!

530
00:52:45,857 --> 00:52:46,892
Sorry.

531
00:52:49,217 --> 00:52:51,936
One understands why some animals
eat their young.

532
00:52:54,657 --> 00:52:56,170
l'm so sorry, Andrew.

533
00:53:02,937 --> 00:53:05,326
Are you all right? You seem very quiet.

534
00:53:08,497 --> 00:53:10,294
How does one obtain freedom?

535
00:53:14,457 --> 00:53:17,176
-You wish to leave us?
-Not at all, Little Miss.

536
00:53:17,497 --> 00:53:20,216
One merely wishes to be declared free.

537
00:53:22,337 --> 00:53:23,292
But why?

538
00:53:23,577 --> 00:53:25,454
You have so much freedom here.

539
00:53:25,537 --> 00:53:27,767
Until one is ordered to do something.

540
00:53:28,377 --> 00:53:31,813
lt's been years since anyone's
given you an order.

541
00:53:31,937 --> 00:53:34,770
But you may still request one
to perform tasks.

542
00:53:35,897 --> 00:53:39,936
We ask all the time, but it's a request,
not an order.

543
00:53:44,737 --> 00:53:46,728
That's not enough for you is it?

544
00:53:49,257 --> 00:53:51,248
One has studied your history.

545
00:53:52,857 --> 00:53:57,772
Terrible wars have been fought
where millions have died for one idea:

546
00:53:58,937 --> 00:53:59,926
Freedom.

547
00:54:01,057 --> 00:54:05,255
And it seems that something
that means so much to so many people...

548
00:54:06,217 --> 00:54:07,889
...would be worth having.

549
00:54:25,457 --> 00:54:27,925
Would now be a good time
to speak with you?

550
00:54:28,337 --> 00:54:30,726
lt's always a good time. You know that.

551
00:54:40,057 --> 00:54:42,366
lt is everything in one's bank account.

552
00:54:44,457 --> 00:54:46,175
Why would you want to give me--

553
00:54:46,257 --> 00:54:47,975
To purchase one's freedom.

554
00:54:49,177 --> 00:54:50,690
One wants to be free.

555
00:54:52,617 --> 00:54:57,054
One would still obey the three laws,
and serve you in exactly the same fashion.

556
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:59,845
The only thing that would change
would be the form.

557
00:54:59,937 --> 00:55:02,167
One would no longer be your property.

558
00:55:03,257 --> 00:55:06,329
You want to leave.
That's what this is about, isn't it?

559
00:55:06,537 --> 00:55:10,086
Not at all, Sir. You are one's family.

560
00:55:10,617 --> 00:55:12,494
Then why ask for this?

561
00:55:15,657 --> 00:55:17,375
l see. You're in on this.

562
00:55:18,617 --> 00:55:20,369
We've talked about it, yes.

563
00:55:21,097 --> 00:55:24,009
So you ordered him to do it and he obeyed.

564
00:55:25,137 --> 00:55:27,970
No. He makes his own decisions.

565
00:55:29,217 --> 00:55:31,253
But you put the idea in his head.

566
00:55:32,297 --> 00:55:33,810
No, Father. You did.

567
00:55:34,217 --> 00:55:37,527
You've given him hundreds of books.
lt was just a matter of time...

568
00:55:37,617 --> 00:55:40,609
...before he became intrigued
by the idea of freedom.

569
00:55:41,257 --> 00:55:43,532
He learns and grows all the time.

570
00:55:43,817 --> 00:55:46,285
lt's because of you,
and Andrew's abilities...

571
00:55:46,377 --> 00:55:49,289
...that he's become every bit
as complex as we are.

572
00:56:04,657 --> 00:56:06,090
Good morning, Sir.

573
00:56:15,017 --> 00:56:17,531
You'll take your check back,
please, Andrew.

574
00:56:18,297 --> 00:56:19,446
Why, Sir?

575
00:56:20,937 --> 00:56:22,450
You are free now.

576
00:56:24,577 --> 00:56:26,693
l must ask you to leave this house.

577
00:56:27,177 --> 00:56:30,089
But, Sir, l don't wish to leave.

578
00:56:31,457 --> 00:56:34,654
You wished for freedom.
You must accept the consequences.

579
00:56:36,897 --> 00:56:38,967
Then l will remove my belongings.

580
00:56:42,257 --> 00:56:43,690
Where would you go?

581
00:56:45,537 --> 00:56:49,450
l will look for a residence nearby
so if you ever need anything, Sir....

582
00:56:49,937 --> 00:56:53,850
That will not happen, Andrew. Thank you.
There's no need to be close by.

583
00:56:54,297 --> 00:56:56,527
lf you command me not to do this,
l will obey.

584
00:56:56,617 --> 00:56:58,255
l command nothing.

585
00:56:59,857 --> 00:57:01,176
You're free.

586
00:57:02,937 --> 00:57:07,249
Then, called or uncalled
l am always at your service.

587
00:57:19,177 --> 00:57:21,771
You've stopped referring
to yourself as ''one.''

588
00:58:40,977 --> 00:58:42,569
A home of my own.

589
00:59:23,897 --> 00:59:25,216
l'm in here.

590
00:59:38,457 --> 00:59:39,890
ls something wrong?

591
00:59:42,137 --> 00:59:43,456
He asked for you.

592
00:59:49,897 --> 00:59:50,932
lt's time.

593
00:59:59,737 --> 01:00:01,170
The robot's here.

594
01:00:11,097 --> 01:00:12,246
Hello, Miss.

595
01:00:18,897 --> 01:00:20,250
How are you, Sir?

596
01:00:22,137 --> 01:00:23,536
l'm dying, Andrew.

597
01:00:25,777 --> 01:00:27,210
Otherwise, l'm fine.

598
01:00:29,097 --> 01:00:30,849
Wonderful to see you again.

599
01:00:31,497 --> 01:00:34,648
l'm very happy to see you, Andrew.
lt's been a long time.

600
01:00:34,737 --> 01:00:36,090
Yes, it has, Sir.

601
01:00:40,337 --> 01:00:41,975
l wanted to tell you...

602
01:00:43,177 --> 01:00:44,656
...that l was wrong.

603
01:00:45,337 --> 01:00:46,975
You're never wrong, Sir.

604
01:00:47,457 --> 01:00:49,254
Then don't contradict me.

605
01:00:49,377 --> 01:00:52,050
You were right to want
your freedom, and...

606
01:00:53,617 --> 01:00:55,573
...l'm glad that you have it.

607
01:00:57,297 --> 01:00:58,525
Thank you, Sir.

608
01:01:05,737 --> 01:01:07,375
You were very good to us.

609
01:01:09,097 --> 01:01:11,167
lt was an honour serving you, Sir.

610
01:01:25,017 --> 01:01:26,928
l want to seek out my own kind.

611
01:01:27,777 --> 01:01:32,134
ln order to understand my destiny,
l must know if there is another like myself.

612
01:01:32,697 --> 01:01:35,336
North Am Robotics will not
return my inquiries.

613
01:01:36,137 --> 01:01:38,446
Now that you've finally
passed the bar, Lloyd...

614
01:01:38,537 --> 01:01:42,815
...l want you to sue them for information
of the whereabouts of all NDR robots.

615
01:01:43,457 --> 01:01:44,856
lf you don't mind.

616
01:01:47,417 --> 01:01:51,046
The Freedom of lnformation Act
doesn't quite cover suits by robots.

617
01:01:51,177 --> 01:01:52,166
Not yet.

618
01:01:52,257 --> 01:01:56,045
Mother, l'm a very busy man.
l do not have time to help it...

619
01:01:56,537 --> 01:01:58,846
...pursue some ridiculous lawsuit.

620
01:01:59,497 --> 01:02:02,136
Lloyd, sweetheart, l do love you.

621
01:02:02,537 --> 01:02:05,449
But sometimes l have to wonder
if you really are my child.

622
01:02:05,537 --> 01:02:07,653
Well, that's mutation, Mother.

623
01:02:07,937 --> 01:02:10,007
The miracle of genetics is: l'm not you.

624
01:02:10,097 --> 01:02:12,736
You've always been more like your father.

625
01:02:13,377 --> 01:02:15,333
So that's why you divorced him.

626
01:02:17,417 --> 01:02:18,406
Sorry.

627
01:02:20,297 --> 01:02:24,609
What would you do if l got the information
on these other NDRs?

628
01:02:24,817 --> 01:02:27,331
l would seek them out.
Each and every one.

629
01:02:28,457 --> 01:02:30,732
So you'd be gone for quite a long time.

630
01:02:31,097 --> 01:02:32,166
Yes.

631
01:02:32,537 --> 01:02:35,768
Several years, if not more,
if my calculations are correct.

632
01:02:39,177 --> 01:02:40,690
l'd love to help you.

633
01:02:42,417 --> 01:02:44,055
Did he not breast-feed?

634
01:03:49,697 --> 01:03:51,050
''Dear Little Miss:

01:05:14,057 --> 01:05:17,413
''I've learned of an NDR robot
that has recently been rebuilt...

644
01:05:17,537 --> 01:05:19,528
''...back home in San Francisco. ''

645
01:05:37,097 --> 01:05:39,292
-Thank you.
-You're quite welcome.

646
01:06:57,377 --> 01:06:58,810
ls this yours?

647
01:07:00,177 --> 01:07:01,405
Thank you.

648
01:07:02,497 --> 01:07:04,533
l'm looking for Rupert Burns.

649
01:07:04,697 --> 01:07:07,928
You've come to the right place. Come in.

650
01:07:08,057 --> 01:07:09,536
Certainly have.

651
01:07:18,897 --> 01:07:21,536
-Do you have a name?
-Of course l do.

652
01:07:21,857 --> 01:07:22,972
Galatea.

653
01:07:24,297 --> 01:07:25,412
Galatea.

654
01:07:26,217 --> 01:07:28,412
You have an amazing agility.

655
01:07:29,457 --> 01:07:31,049
You were dancing in the market.

656
01:07:31,137 --> 01:07:33,412
-Did you like that?
-Very much.

657
01:07:34,977 --> 01:07:37,332
Dancing is the sportiest sport.

658
01:07:37,657 --> 01:07:40,125
And we're so much better at it
than humans.

659
01:07:40,857 --> 01:07:43,496
l can't believe l finally found you.

660
01:07:44,177 --> 01:07:45,656
When did you know?

661
01:07:45,897 --> 01:07:47,125
Know what?

662
01:07:47,537 --> 01:07:49,334
That you were unique?

663
01:07:49,577 --> 01:07:51,488
l knew that right away.

664
01:07:52,577 --> 01:07:53,646
Me, too.

665
01:07:54,897 --> 01:07:58,094
You and l, we're the same.

666
01:08:02,657 --> 01:08:04,409
We have personality.

667
01:08:06,977 --> 01:08:09,172
ls your personality chip turned on?

668
01:08:10,177 --> 01:08:11,496
lsn't yours?

669
01:08:12,177 --> 01:08:13,053
No.

670
01:08:14,497 --> 01:08:16,055
Sucks to be you!

671
01:08:16,377 --> 01:08:21,132
l think personality is much more fun
than intelligence. Don't you?

672
01:08:23,497 --> 01:08:24,771
l think so.

673
01:08:29,897 --> 01:08:31,296
Can l help you?

674
01:08:31,697 --> 01:08:34,769
Your robot is just a standard NDR,
isn't she?

675
01:08:35,657 --> 01:08:37,773
Yeah, l'm afraid so.

676
01:08:38,337 --> 01:08:40,646
Why does she have the ability to dance?

677
01:08:40,897 --> 01:08:45,209
Because l put a modified skeletal chip
into her during her rebuild.

678
01:08:46,097 --> 01:08:49,373
-How did you do the modification?
-My father taught me.

679
01:08:49,657 --> 01:08:52,410
He created the android unit
at North Am Robotics.

680
01:08:52,537 --> 01:08:56,325
He created the technology that allows you
to mimic human expression.

681
01:08:56,417 --> 01:08:57,645
What happened to him?

682
01:08:57,737 --> 01:09:02,253
North Am laid him off, so we started
this place. l took over when he died.

683
01:09:03,297 --> 01:09:04,650
l'm sorry to hear that.

684
01:09:04,737 --> 01:09:07,490
He would've been absolutely thrilled
to meet you.

685
01:09:08,297 --> 01:09:09,776
l'm Rupert Burns.

686
01:09:09,857 --> 01:09:12,132
-lt's a real honour.
-The honour is mine.

687
01:09:13,537 --> 01:09:15,573
You and l, we're the same!

688
01:09:17,697 --> 01:09:19,494
Let's get loco, robo!

689
01:09:22,617 --> 01:09:24,573
Shut her off, or l will!

690
01:09:32,017 --> 01:09:33,245
Thank you.

691
01:09:35,017 --> 01:09:36,530
ls this your father's work?

692
01:09:37,737 --> 01:09:41,571
Yeah. lt's our work, you could say.

693
01:09:42,177 --> 01:09:45,931
l haven't been able to restrain myself
from continuing to tinker with...

694
01:09:46,017 --> 01:09:49,487
...the relentlessly unfashionable
android technology.

695
01:09:49,577 --> 01:09:52,614
As a matter of fact,
l've actually gotten to a point...

696
01:09:53,537 --> 01:09:57,849
...where l can pretty much exactly replicate
the external physical appearance...

697
01:09:58,017 --> 01:09:59,769
...of a human being.

698
01:10:06,777 --> 01:10:08,051
Remarkable.

699
01:10:08,497 --> 01:10:09,725
Thank you.

700
01:10:11,857 --> 01:10:12,972
Amazing!

701
01:10:15,057 --> 01:10:19,892
Unfortunately, nobody seems terribly
interested in funding my research, but--

702
01:10:20,137 --> 01:10:21,092
l am.

703
01:10:23,857 --> 01:10:25,927
l will fund your research.

704
01:10:27,097 --> 01:10:28,086
Yeah?

705
01:10:29,937 --> 01:10:31,416
That'd be cool.

706
01:10:37,537 --> 01:10:39,050
Thank you, darling.

707
01:10:40,417 --> 01:10:44,456
l want to make it very clear
this is an external physical upgrade only.

708
01:10:44,537 --> 01:10:46,732
Strictly speaking, you'll feel nothing.

709
01:10:46,817 --> 01:10:49,126
None of your internal mechanisms
will be changed.

710
01:10:49,217 --> 01:10:51,526
You'll be subject to your positronic brain.

711
01:10:51,617 --> 01:10:53,369
-ls that clear?
-Understood.

712
01:10:54,937 --> 01:10:58,293
Now, have you given
any thought whatsoever...

713
01:10:59,697 --> 01:11:02,052
...as to what age you'd like to be?

714
01:11:02,217 --> 01:11:04,492
Officially, l am 62 years old.

715
01:11:05,777 --> 01:11:07,893
-Let's take off 25 years.
-15.

716
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:09,496
-20.
-Perfect.

717
01:11:13,057 --> 01:11:17,096
Believe it or not, the secret to all this
is actually imperfection.

718
01:11:17,937 --> 01:11:19,131
lmperfection?

719
01:11:19,577 --> 01:11:23,570
Things like wrinkles,
less-than-perfect teeth.

720
01:11:24,777 --> 01:11:28,008
Details like fading scars, little pockmarks.
Look at my nose.

721
01:11:28,097 --> 01:11:31,772
See my nose?
lt's bulbous and slightly irregular.

722
01:11:31,937 --> 01:11:32,926
lt is.

723
01:11:33,017 --> 01:11:35,736
l'm the only one who has my nose.
That's what makes me me.

724
01:11:35,817 --> 01:11:39,287
We must incorporate these features
into your design so that you can be...

725
01:11:39,377 --> 01:11:41,015
...the only one of you.

726
01:11:41,097 --> 01:11:43,975
That's what makes us unique
is those imperfections.

727
01:11:44,577 --> 01:11:47,216
l see. Like the shape of your head.

728
01:11:48,937 --> 01:11:50,734
What about the shape of my head?

729
01:11:50,817 --> 01:11:52,045
lt's huge.

730
01:11:57,177 --> 01:11:58,451
But lovely.

731
01:12:00,097 --> 01:12:01,325
Thank you.

732
01:12:22,457 --> 01:12:24,732
What happened? What's going on?

733
01:12:27,697 --> 01:12:29,130
What happened?

734
01:12:30,217 --> 01:12:31,935
l saw the inner me.

735
01:13:19,737 --> 01:13:20,852
ls it ready?

736
01:13:28,257 --> 01:13:31,215
-Please be careful. Don't drop me.
-l'm being careful.

737
01:13:31,297 --> 01:13:33,857
Oh, my God! Just relax. Relax.

738
01:13:35,097 --> 01:13:37,247
Why did you do that?
That wasn't very funny.

739
01:13:37,337 --> 01:13:39,248
Just keeping you on your toes.

740
01:13:39,377 --> 01:13:42,449
-l don't have any toes.
-You do now.

741
01:13:44,217 --> 01:13:45,172
l do.

742
01:13:45,857 --> 01:13:47,085
And hands.

743
01:13:47,457 --> 01:13:48,776
And fingers!

744
01:13:49,097 --> 01:13:51,565
-How do l look?
-See for yourself.

745
01:14:23,377 --> 01:14:24,605
Thank you.

746
01:14:56,657 --> 01:14:57,885
Beautiful.

747
01:15:00,177 --> 01:15:01,212
Sorry.

748
01:15:01,697 --> 01:15:02,812
Who are you?

749
01:15:03,457 --> 01:15:04,412
Andrew.

750
01:15:05,417 --> 01:15:06,406
Andrew?

751
01:15:07,937 --> 01:15:10,007
You look wonderful. Even younger.

752
01:15:10,697 --> 01:15:12,130
How do you do that?

753
01:15:12,377 --> 01:15:13,810
Do l know you?

754
01:15:14,617 --> 01:15:18,087
l know l look different, too.
l've had an upgrade. Touch it.

755
01:15:19,937 --> 01:15:21,529
Sorry. The face.

756
01:15:22,177 --> 01:15:23,735
What's going on?

757
01:15:24,297 --> 01:15:26,049
You leave her alone!

758
01:15:28,057 --> 01:15:29,570
-Who are you?
-Andrew.

759
01:15:31,537 --> 01:15:32,856
No. Andrew?

760
01:15:33,577 --> 01:15:35,807
-But Andrew's a robot.
-Yes, l am.

761
01:15:35,897 --> 01:15:37,535
Well, now an android.

762
01:15:37,617 --> 01:15:39,096
He's had an upgrade.

763
01:15:39,377 --> 01:15:40,696
l know that.

764
01:15:43,297 --> 01:15:44,286
Hello.

765
01:15:46,097 --> 01:15:48,133
Hello. lt is you!

766
01:15:51,937 --> 01:15:53,655
-You know him?
-Yes.

767
01:15:54,097 --> 01:15:57,009
-You know me? Who're you?
-l'm Little Miss.

768
01:15:57,817 --> 01:15:59,535
-That's Little Miss.
-No.

769
01:16:01,217 --> 01:16:03,412
-No. That's Portia.
-Portia?

770
01:16:07,577 --> 01:16:09,647
-Who's Portia?
-My granddaughter.

771
01:16:10,057 --> 01:16:13,367
Your granddaughter?
ls this some kind of trick?

772
01:16:14,457 --> 01:16:15,890
You're Little Miss?

773
01:16:16,337 --> 01:16:18,646
Then what right do you have
to look like her?

774
01:16:18,737 --> 01:16:21,649
There is and can be only one Little Miss.

775
01:16:22,257 --> 01:16:23,246
Really?

776
01:16:23,337 --> 01:16:27,125
lt's a genetic resemblance.
Sometimes it skips a generation.

777
01:16:27,337 --> 01:16:29,771
-l don't care. l don't like it.
-l can see that.

778
01:16:29,857 --> 01:16:32,849
lf you took a moment,
which l see you're not inclined to do...

779
01:16:32,937 --> 01:16:35,895
...you'd realise Portia and l
are very different people.

780
01:16:38,057 --> 01:16:40,093
Why is she imitating you?

781
01:16:40,817 --> 01:16:42,887
-What's so funny?
-You are.

782
01:16:43,137 --> 01:16:45,253
l'm not trying to be funny.

783
01:16:46,657 --> 01:16:49,125
Things have certainly changed around here.

784
01:16:50,257 --> 01:16:52,646
That happens after 20 years.

785
01:16:54,377 --> 01:16:57,210
l have so much to tell you. Come with me.

786
01:17:00,857 --> 01:17:02,085
lt is you.

787
01:17:03,057 --> 01:17:03,967
Yes.

788
01:17:10,377 --> 01:17:12,652
-Hello, my friend.
-Hello, Little Miss.

789
01:17:15,137 --> 01:17:17,287
-Whose daughter is she?
-Lloyd's.

790
01:17:17,497 --> 01:17:19,453
Now the rudeness makes sense.

791
01:17:40,537 --> 01:17:42,175
Go home to your master.

792
01:17:45,337 --> 01:17:47,612
You don't have a home, do you?

793
01:17:49,417 --> 01:17:51,806
l don't have food. l don't eat.

794
01:17:56,937 --> 01:17:59,770
Come in. We'll keep each other company.

795
01:18:23,457 --> 01:18:25,049
l know you don't like me.

796
01:18:25,137 --> 01:18:28,095
l don't like you either.
l just want to make that clear.

797
01:18:28,177 --> 01:18:30,407
Couldn't be more clear
if you spat in my face.

798
01:18:30,497 --> 01:18:33,136
l can't. l don't have a mucous gland.

799
01:18:41,897 --> 01:18:45,207
Would it be possible
to have a slightly longer conversation?

800
01:18:50,457 --> 01:18:53,017
May my canine companion enter also?

801
01:18:57,177 --> 01:18:58,405
Thank you.

802
01:19:12,697 --> 01:19:14,608
ls this your sculpture?

803
01:19:16,217 --> 01:19:19,050
No, l'm restoring it.
l'm a preservation architect.

804
01:19:20,097 --> 01:19:21,655
lt's quite horrendous.

805
01:19:23,417 --> 01:19:25,726
How ugly was it before you restored it?

806
01:19:26,297 --> 01:19:28,936
First you get mad at me
because of how l look.

807
01:19:30,017 --> 01:19:33,054
Now you show up at my door,
announce that you don't like me...

808
01:19:33,137 --> 01:19:35,014
...and then you criticise my work.

809
01:19:35,177 --> 01:19:38,613
Once again, l apologise for telling the truth
but it can't be helped.

810
01:19:38,697 --> 01:19:40,176
lt's my programming.

811
01:19:41,537 --> 01:19:44,005
What is it exactly that you want?

812
01:19:44,897 --> 01:19:45,966
Family.

813
01:19:48,097 --> 01:19:49,450
My last name is Martin.

814
01:19:49,537 --> 01:19:52,609
l'm so named because your
great-grandfather and grandmother...

815
01:19:52,697 --> 01:19:55,086
...considered me to be
a member of your family.

816
01:19:55,377 --> 01:19:56,935
Now Sir is dead.

817
01:19:57,417 --> 01:19:59,055
Little Miss is getting older.

818
01:19:59,137 --> 01:20:02,812
You don't like me, but you'll talk to me
if l knock on your door long enough.

819
01:20:02,897 --> 01:20:04,376
-ls that a joke?
-No.

820
01:20:04,457 --> 01:20:06,015
Would you like to hear a joke?

821
01:20:06,097 --> 01:20:09,806
This Buddhist says to a hot dog vendor,
''Make me one with everything.''

822
01:20:13,337 --> 01:20:16,966
-Andrew, do you have any friends at all?
-No.

823
01:20:18,377 --> 01:20:22,734
Only Woofy, who's very sweet, but
not challenging on a conversational level.

824
01:20:24,177 --> 01:20:26,566
That is the extent of his skills.

825
01:20:26,657 --> 01:20:29,251
-So you want someone to talk to?
-With.

826
01:20:29,337 --> 01:20:33,046
-Even if that person doesn't like you?
-You can't have everything.

827
01:20:33,897 --> 01:20:36,252
ls that right?
ls it, ''You can have everything''?

828
01:20:36,337 --> 01:20:39,329
Some people do,
so l'm somewhat confused on that level.

829
01:20:43,337 --> 01:20:44,486
Sit down.

830
01:20:44,577 --> 01:20:46,215
-Let's talk.
-Thank you.

831
01:20:53,377 --> 01:20:54,856
Hey there, handsome.

832
01:20:55,217 --> 01:20:57,367
Could l get you anything to drink?

833
01:20:57,857 --> 01:20:59,734
l'm sorry. l have no stomach.

834
01:21:01,177 --> 01:21:04,214
-Could l get something for him?
-He has a stomach, yes.

835
01:21:45,537 --> 01:21:46,811
How is she?

836
01:21:47,297 --> 01:21:48,776
She's sleeping.

837
01:21:49,177 --> 01:21:50,610
What happened?

838
01:21:51,417 --> 01:21:53,009
She had a stroke.

839
01:22:27,217 --> 01:22:28,411
There you are.

840
01:22:30,257 --> 01:22:31,656
Little Miss.

841
01:23:22,577 --> 01:23:23,771
She's gone.

842
01:23:37,577 --> 01:23:40,489
lt's cruel that you can cry and l cannot.

843
01:23:41,537 --> 01:23:44,256
There is a terrible pain l cannot express.

844
01:23:48,337 --> 01:23:50,771
Will every human being that l care for...

845
01:23:52,937 --> 01:23:56,168
...just leave?

846
01:24:01,497 --> 01:24:02,930
l'm afraid so.

847
01:24:07,217 --> 01:24:08,650
That won't do.

848
01:24:13,897 --> 01:24:18,015
This is remarkably impressive.
You did this all by yourself?

849
01:24:18,417 --> 01:24:21,853
Yes. l downloaded every known
medical textbook into my memory.

850
01:24:22,377 --> 01:24:25,608
l studied them.
That's how l came up with these drawings.

851
01:24:26,897 --> 01:24:31,413
l know they're primitive and not complete.
l need you to fill in the mechanical gaps.

852
01:24:32,657 --> 01:24:34,613
This is another upgrade.

853
01:24:34,857 --> 01:24:37,166
lt's considerably more than an upgrade.

854
01:24:37,697 --> 01:24:40,575
You're talking about
a profound transition...

855
01:24:41,377 --> 01:24:43,971
...from the mechanical to the biological.

856
01:24:44,577 --> 01:24:47,774
l realise that. l believe it is
the ideal marriage of both fields.

857
01:24:47,857 --> 01:24:51,088
Not only that,
but this stuff could cut both ways.

858
01:24:51,177 --> 01:24:55,170
I don't think that any existing
prosthetic devices hold a candle...

859
01:24:55,257 --> 01:24:57,248
...to what you've designed here.

860
01:24:57,617 --> 01:25:00,734
I mean, you could use these
in human beings as well.

861
01:25:01,177 --> 01:25:02,292
Exactly.

862
01:25:37,537 --> 01:25:39,653
What a piece of faecal matter.

863
01:25:40,057 --> 01:25:41,126
''Shit.''

864
01:25:41,217 --> 01:25:43,572
-Excuse me?
-What a piece of shit.

865
01:25:43,897 --> 01:25:45,012
l know that.

866
01:25:45,377 --> 01:25:48,130
When you're frustrated you say,
''piece of shit.''

867
01:25:50,897 --> 01:25:52,330
Piece of shit.

868
01:25:52,737 --> 01:25:54,614
Yes, but with feeling.

869
01:25:56,097 --> 01:25:57,655
-What a piece of shit.
-More.

870
01:25:57,737 --> 01:26:00,046
-What a piece of shit!
-Good, very good.

871
01:26:03,297 --> 01:26:06,448
Are you aware that what you've
essentially designed here...

872
01:26:06,537 --> 01:26:08,414
...is a human central nervous system?

873
01:26:08,497 --> 01:26:10,613
That was my intention, yes.

874
01:26:11,817 --> 01:26:16,811
Well, you got to realise that
a nervous system will radically enhance...

875
01:26:17,057 --> 01:26:20,652
...the way you feel and perceive
the world around you.

876
01:26:21,137 --> 01:26:24,732
l'm not just talking about hot and cold
and little tiny pinpricks.

877
01:26:25,337 --> 01:26:26,895
Put it this way.

878
01:26:28,577 --> 01:26:30,727
As your experience becomes varied...

879
01:26:31,417 --> 01:26:37,367
...so will the feelings, emotions,
sensations stimulated by that experience.

880
01:26:38,337 --> 01:26:40,976
And, while some of these
will be very subtle...

881
01:26:42,017 --> 01:26:44,770
...and wonderful, and nuanced,
and shaded...

882
01:26:45,737 --> 01:26:49,696
...others will be profoundly intense
and difficult to tolerate.

883
01:26:53,097 --> 01:26:55,406
Do you feel like you're ready for that?

884
01:27:04,777 --> 01:27:05,926
Absolutely.

885
01:27:14,537 --> 01:27:16,368
-Lovely.
-Thank you.

886
01:27:17,417 --> 01:27:19,328
l was referring to the statue.

887
01:27:19,937 --> 01:27:21,006
l know.

888
01:27:23,777 --> 01:27:25,847
Could you fix this piece of shit?

889
01:27:27,257 --> 01:27:29,293
l don't know. Let me take a look.

890
01:27:39,497 --> 01:27:42,250
Andrew, l'm sure
you could restore this yourself.

891
01:27:42,977 --> 01:27:44,296
Yes, l could...

892
01:27:45,897 --> 01:27:48,172
...but you could do it much better.

893
01:27:51,137 --> 01:27:53,287
l'd be happy to fix it for you.

894
01:27:53,857 --> 01:27:56,451
-lf it's not too much effort.
-No, not at all.

895
01:27:58,577 --> 01:28:01,455
l've been working all day
and l could use some air.

896
01:28:01,617 --> 01:28:05,246
-Do you want to go for a walk?
-That would be quite splendid. Yes.

897
01:28:06,217 --> 01:28:08,208
Why are you laughing at me?

898
01:28:08,297 --> 01:28:12,734
You're always so polite and so proper.
lt's very sweet.

899
01:28:13,377 --> 01:28:14,605
Thank you.

900
01:28:15,737 --> 01:28:18,205
Let's go. Thank you.

901
01:28:21,097 --> 01:28:25,329
''When a man's an empty kettle
he should be on his mettle

902
01:28:25,937 --> 01:28:28,610
''And yet l'm torn apart

903
01:28:29,217 --> 01:28:33,574
''lt's because l'm presumin'
that l could be kinda human

904
01:28:33,737 --> 01:28:36,490
''lf l only had a heart

905
01:28:37,377 --> 01:28:40,733
-''Picture me a balcony....''
-Do you have an impact drill?

906
01:28:41,337 --> 01:28:43,328
-Over on the rack.
-Thank you.

907
01:28:47,217 --> 01:28:48,252
Jesus!

908
01:28:50,817 --> 01:28:55,607
There's a party next week to celebrate
the opening of a building that l restored.

909
01:28:56,537 --> 01:28:59,688
All my friends will be there.
lt would be great if you could come.

910
01:28:59,777 --> 01:29:01,733
l would love to. Thank you.

911
01:29:04,057 --> 01:29:06,048
l think you're letting me win.

912
01:29:13,937 --> 01:29:15,165
Checkmate.

913
01:30:17,657 --> 01:30:20,933
Charles, why don't you go get us a drink?

914
01:30:25,577 --> 01:30:26,805
Thank you.

915
01:31:51,057 --> 01:31:54,572
l never understood the phrase,
''Pearls before swans.''

916
01:31:55,057 --> 01:31:56,536
-What?
-''Swine.''

917
01:31:56,937 --> 01:31:58,928
Then the ballet is not ''Swine Lake.''

918
01:31:59,017 --> 01:32:01,815
Oh, God.
Nobody makes me laugh like you.

919
01:32:02,457 --> 01:32:05,290
Laughter is essential for a good friendship.

920
01:32:05,377 --> 01:32:06,651
Yes, it is.

921
01:32:10,697 --> 01:32:12,813
Sometimes l get the feeling that...

922
01:32:14,977 --> 01:32:17,696
...you feel a certain way about us...

923
01:32:17,897 --> 01:32:21,412
...and that you wish your....

924
01:32:23,817 --> 01:32:24,772
What?

925
01:32:25,737 --> 01:32:28,410
l don't know. lt's just a little....

926
01:32:28,937 --> 01:32:31,405
Having this conversation with....

927
01:32:32,857 --> 01:32:34,051
-A robot?
-Yes.

928
01:32:35,377 --> 01:32:37,891
l mean, a thing is itself, Andrew.

929
01:32:38,017 --> 01:32:42,613
A tree is a tree. Water is water.
You are a magnificent machine.

930
01:32:43,817 --> 01:32:47,093
No matter how much you change,
that's what you'll always be.

931
01:32:47,657 --> 01:32:48,646
No.

932
01:32:49,137 --> 01:32:52,209
l can't believe that, will not believe that.

933
01:32:52,417 --> 01:32:54,885
l realise l am not entirely human.

934
01:32:55,057 --> 01:32:57,651
That's why people don't always like
or understand me.

935
01:32:57,737 --> 01:32:59,489
-l like you.
-You do?

936
01:32:59,697 --> 01:33:02,495
l even understand you some of the time.

937
01:33:03,337 --> 01:33:07,296
But l can't invest my emotions
in a machine.

938
01:33:13,217 --> 01:33:15,253
lt must be a genetic trait.

939
01:33:19,537 --> 01:33:21,095
Things change, Portia.

940
01:33:22,737 --> 01:33:24,534
Things always change.

941
01:33:31,297 --> 01:33:32,935
She laughed at me.

942
01:33:33,057 --> 01:33:35,810
''A thing is itself, Andrew. Water is water.''

943
01:33:37,297 --> 01:33:40,095
What about ice? What about steam?

944
01:33:40,337 --> 01:33:42,089
Andy, you got to calm down.

945
01:33:43,097 --> 01:33:45,565
Do you know what it's like
to be laughed at?

946
01:33:45,657 --> 01:33:48,171
Humiliating. lt's an abomination.

947
01:33:49,497 --> 01:33:52,216
Look at me. Look what l'm doing here.

948
01:33:52,817 --> 01:33:56,730
l'm trying to make something of myself.
l'm trying to fulfil my destiny.

949
01:33:56,817 --> 01:33:58,091
Does she notice?

950
01:33:58,977 --> 01:34:03,175
l don't want you to take this personally,
but l have to work now. Good night.

951
01:34:12,297 --> 01:34:14,731
Where have you been?
l've been trying to call you.

952
01:34:14,817 --> 01:34:16,296
-Poke me in the eye.
-What?

953
01:34:16,377 --> 01:34:18,288
-Poke me in the eye!
-You're crazy.

954
01:34:18,377 --> 01:34:20,095
Poke me in the eye!

955
01:34:22,697 --> 01:34:23,846
That hurts!

956
01:34:25,537 --> 01:34:27,812
-lt works!
-What the hell's going on?

957
01:34:27,937 --> 01:34:31,168
lt's my neural net!
l'm the proud owner of a nervous system.

958
01:34:31,257 --> 01:34:33,293
-You can feel.
-Yes, very much!

959
01:34:33,937 --> 01:34:37,134
Do something for me? Perform
an experiment for the sake of science.

960
01:34:37,217 --> 01:34:38,650
-All right.
-Kiss me.

961
01:34:41,417 --> 01:34:42,850
No, not there.

962
01:34:43,617 --> 01:34:44,572
Here.

963
01:34:51,697 --> 01:34:52,925
Thank you.

964
01:34:54,417 --> 01:34:57,011
-Could you feel it?
-lt's wonderful.

965
01:34:58,537 --> 01:35:00,892
lt's everything they say it is.

966
01:35:02,737 --> 01:35:03,852
And you?

967
01:35:10,457 --> 01:35:11,856
What's wrong?

968
01:35:14,297 --> 01:35:16,492
Charles and l are getting married.

969
01:35:23,497 --> 01:35:25,089
He's a lucky man.

970
01:35:26,217 --> 01:35:29,687
-Congratulations to the both of you.
-Goddamn it, Andrew!

971
01:35:30,337 --> 01:35:34,171
lf you're going to succeed
at this thing you're trying to do...

972
01:35:34,337 --> 01:35:36,805
...you've got to stop being
so damn deferential.

973
01:35:36,897 --> 01:35:40,094
-l can't help being deferential. lt's built-in.
-Then change.

974
01:35:40,257 --> 01:35:42,487
Change? l have changed.

975
01:35:42,857 --> 01:35:45,655
l don't mean on the outside.
Change on the inside.

976
01:35:45,937 --> 01:35:48,053
Take chances, make mistakes.

977
01:35:48,137 --> 01:35:52,449
Sometimes it's important not to be perfect.
lt's important to do the wrong thing!

978
01:35:52,577 --> 01:35:54,295
-Do the wrong thing?
-Yes.

979
01:35:54,857 --> 01:35:57,325
Why? l see. To learn from your mistakes.

980
01:35:57,417 --> 01:35:59,055
No. To make them!

981
01:35:59,137 --> 01:36:02,686
To find out what's real and what's not,
to find out what you feel.

982
01:36:03,617 --> 01:36:05,608
Human beings are terrible messes.

983
01:36:05,697 --> 01:36:07,449
l'll grant you that.

984
01:36:08,737 --> 01:36:12,525
l see. This is what is known as
an irrational conversation, isn't it?

985
01:36:13,417 --> 01:36:15,408
This is a human conversation.

986
01:36:15,537 --> 01:36:19,166
lt's not about being rational.
lt's about following your heart.

987
01:36:20,217 --> 01:36:22,412
-And that's what l should do?
-Yes.

988
01:36:22,697 --> 01:36:24,767
And you have a heart, Andrew.

989
01:36:24,897 --> 01:36:29,049
l feel it. l don't even believe it sometimes,
but l do feel it.

990
01:36:30,777 --> 01:36:32,927
And in order to follow that heart...

991
01:36:36,617 --> 01:36:38,573
...one must do the wrong thing.

992
01:36:38,977 --> 01:36:39,887
Yes.

993
01:36:45,057 --> 01:36:46,285
Thank you.

994
01:37:19,777 --> 01:37:23,406
Could you be a little more careful?
That's very delicate equipment.

995
01:37:28,577 --> 01:37:29,612
Sorry!

996
01:37:30,417 --> 01:37:31,611
What are you doing?

997
01:37:31,697 --> 01:37:34,165
Near as l can tell, your bitch work!

998
01:37:34,617 --> 01:37:35,686
My what?

999
01:37:35,777 --> 01:37:38,655
You heard me, and l'm sick of it!

1000
01:37:39,137 --> 01:37:42,254
All day long it's, ''Yes, Rupert, sir,''
''No, Rupert, sir.''

1001
01:37:42,337 --> 01:37:46,046
''Would you like another beverage,
Rupert, sir?'' And it chaps my ass!

1002
01:37:46,777 --> 01:37:49,245
So here's a helpful hint for you.

1003
01:37:50,137 --> 01:37:52,492
Shut up, and let me do my work!

1004
01:38:09,937 --> 01:38:11,086
l'm done.

1005
01:38:17,217 --> 01:38:18,696
''Chaps my ass''?

1006
01:38:27,977 --> 01:38:30,445
-Where's the chip?
-l replaced it.

1007
01:38:31,697 --> 01:38:34,336
She's uncooperative, abusive,
confrontational--

1008
01:38:34,537 --> 01:38:36,289
And a lot more interesting.

1009
01:38:36,617 --> 01:38:38,812
Arguably, but we're not getting
any work done.

1010
01:38:38,897 --> 01:38:41,969
Please give me
the old personality chip back.

1011
01:38:43,897 --> 01:38:45,853
Fine. She can be perky again.

1012
01:38:46,617 --> 01:38:48,414
''Perky''? She's just a robot--

1013
01:38:48,497 --> 01:38:50,010
l didn't mean it that way.

1014
01:38:52,377 --> 01:38:53,935
l really didn't mean that.

1015
01:38:54,017 --> 01:38:57,054
What's the matter with you today?
Where are you going?

1016
01:39:05,457 --> 01:39:07,732
Aunt Jamie, l want you too meet Charles.

1017
01:39:07,817 --> 01:39:10,251
-This is my Aunt Jamie.
-Nice to meet you.

1018
01:39:24,857 --> 01:39:26,415
What's going on?

1019
01:39:27,337 --> 01:39:29,567
Portia's parents are giving
an engagement party...

1020
01:39:29,657 --> 01:39:31,966
...that l wasn't invited to
for obvious reasons.

1021
01:39:33,217 --> 01:39:34,616
-There he is.
-Who?

1022
01:39:34,697 --> 01:39:36,289
-The prospective groom.
-Where?

1023
01:39:36,377 --> 01:39:40,450
Where? The one in the pale blue suit
with the big pointy chin!

1024
01:39:41,177 --> 01:39:44,249
-He's got a pointy chin?
-You can put an eye out with that chin!

1025
01:39:45,017 --> 01:39:47,690
That's nothing compared to his teeth.
Look at that!

1026
01:39:48,137 --> 01:39:51,607
-l'm amazed he's out in daylight.
-Yeah, he's got funny teeth.

1027
01:39:51,817 --> 01:39:54,092
You need to upgrade your eyes.

1028
01:39:54,417 --> 01:39:57,648
That shouldn't stop Portia.
She can marry whoever she likes.

1029
01:39:57,737 --> 01:40:01,650
One day she'll wake up and realise
she's married to a man...

1030
01:40:01,977 --> 01:40:04,969
...whose face closely resembles
an antique can opener.

1031
01:40:06,337 --> 01:40:08,009
The kind that used to go....

1032
01:40:08,097 --> 01:40:10,691
The ones that move around,
and the can pops off.

1033
01:40:10,777 --> 01:40:12,290
You're jealous.

1034
01:40:12,817 --> 01:40:14,614
-No, l'm not!
-You're jealous!

1035
01:40:14,697 --> 01:40:17,894
You are. Otherwise, what're you doing
spying on Portia?

1036
01:40:19,457 --> 01:40:21,254
My God, l am jealous.

1037
01:40:22,617 --> 01:40:24,892
lf l'm jealous, that means l'm in love.

1038
01:40:27,017 --> 01:40:29,326
lf l'm in love, then all hope is gone.

1039
01:40:30,377 --> 01:40:31,810
l've lost her.

1040
01:41:05,537 --> 01:41:07,493
Would you like a sip of my beer?

1041
01:41:08,697 --> 01:41:11,495
lt'd be a waste. l could not taste it.

1042
01:41:11,977 --> 01:41:13,615
What if you could?

1043
01:41:13,937 --> 01:41:15,609
That would be exquisite.

1044
01:41:19,377 --> 01:41:22,414
l've come up with a design,
or a modification rather...

1045
01:41:23,537 --> 01:41:28,452
...that if l'm correct, would enable you
to deal with solid foods and liquids.

1046
01:41:29,777 --> 01:41:31,654
-And taste?
-Taste, too.

1047
01:41:33,937 --> 01:41:37,850
And also, if my schematics are correct...

1048
01:41:39,937 --> 01:41:45,375
...l think l've come up with a method
to make you a complete man.

1049
01:41:47,137 --> 01:41:48,286
Complete?

1050
01:41:48,897 --> 01:41:50,046
Complete.

1051
01:41:57,857 --> 01:41:59,006
Complete?

1052
01:41:59,697 --> 01:42:04,646
Not in a reproductive sense,
of course, but in terms of approximating...

1053
01:42:05,857 --> 01:42:10,726
...the physical sensation, you know,
that occurs...

1054
01:42:13,817 --> 01:42:15,853
-...friction.
-Sexual relations?

1055
01:42:19,737 --> 01:42:22,376
l've always been fascinated by that.

1056
01:42:22,537 --> 01:42:23,811
l mean, curious.

1057
01:42:25,297 --> 01:42:29,085
Because of what they say.

1058
01:42:29,977 --> 01:42:31,569
What do they say?

1059
01:42:34,257 --> 01:42:36,134
That you can lose yourself.

1060
01:42:37,497 --> 01:42:40,216
Everything. All boundaries, all time.

1061
01:42:43,057 --> 01:42:45,446
That two bodies can become so mixed-up...

1062
01:42:46,777 --> 01:42:49,496
...that you don't know who's who
or what's what.

1063
01:42:50,537 --> 01:42:54,371
And just when the sweet confusion
is so intense you think you'll die...

1064
01:42:54,537 --> 01:42:58,291
...you kind of do,
leaving you alone in your separate body.

1065
01:42:59,417 --> 01:43:01,567
But the one you love is still there.

1066
01:43:02,537 --> 01:43:04,129
That's a miracle.

1067
01:43:05,417 --> 01:43:07,851
You can go to Heaven and come back alive.

1068
01:43:10,617 --> 01:43:15,008
Go back, anytime you want
with the one you love.

1069
01:43:18,737 --> 01:43:21,649
-And you want to experience that?
-Yes, please.

1070
01:43:24,097 --> 01:43:25,212
So do l.

1071
01:44:05,617 --> 01:44:07,972
Excuse me. l'll be right back.

1072
01:44:12,257 --> 01:44:14,054
l didn't expect to see you.

1073
01:44:15,537 --> 01:44:17,926
l remember this place very well.

1074
01:44:18,537 --> 01:44:20,607
This is where your grandmother
was married.

1075
01:44:20,697 --> 01:44:23,370
l wanted it ready for my own wedding.

1076
01:44:23,697 --> 01:44:26,848
-So you're not married yet?
-No, two weeks from Saturday.

1077
01:44:27,137 --> 01:44:28,729
l'm not too late.

1078
01:44:29,617 --> 01:44:31,892
Are you positive you're doing
the right thing?

1079
01:44:31,977 --> 01:44:34,332
-Positive.
-About getting married?

1080
01:44:34,417 --> 01:44:37,966
-l'm never positive about anything.
-You could be doing the wrong thing.

1081
01:44:38,057 --> 01:44:40,571
-l'm pretty sure l'm doing the right thing.
-Great.

1082
01:44:40,737 --> 01:44:42,375
Why is that great?

1083
01:44:42,457 --> 01:44:44,527
You told me to do the wrong thing.

1084
01:44:44,617 --> 01:44:47,575
You aren't doing the wrong thing,
you're doing the right thing.

1085
01:44:47,657 --> 01:44:51,570
You're not following your own advice,
'cause if you were you wouldn't marry him.

1086
01:44:51,657 --> 01:44:54,649
-Because l would be doing the right thing.
-Precisely.

1087
01:44:55,937 --> 01:44:58,405
ln some strange way,
you're starting to make sense.

1088
01:44:58,497 --> 01:44:59,452
Good.

1089
01:45:00,057 --> 01:45:03,891
You know what it's like to be in love with
someone who's marrying someone else?

1090
01:45:04,697 --> 01:45:06,096
Someone who's magnificent?

1091
01:45:06,177 --> 01:45:09,647
Someone who walks into a room
and lights it up like the sun?

1092
01:45:09,857 --> 01:45:12,291
Someone who you know is lying to herself?

1093
01:45:13,497 --> 01:45:16,136
-Lying?
-Convincingly. Very much so.

1094
01:45:16,457 --> 01:45:17,731
About what?

1095
01:45:18,017 --> 01:45:21,805
That you don't love me when l know,
at least in some way, you do.

1096
01:45:23,537 --> 01:45:25,573
And how do you know that?

1097
01:45:25,937 --> 01:45:28,246
l have done everything, inside and out.

1098
01:45:28,457 --> 01:45:31,017
-That stuff doesn't matter to me.
-Something matters.

1099
01:45:31,097 --> 01:45:33,213
lf nothing mattered, you'd love me...

1100
01:45:33,297 --> 01:45:36,095
...and not some man whose chin
could sink the Titanic.

1101
01:45:36,777 --> 01:45:39,337
What? See? lt's true, isn't it?

1102
01:45:40,617 --> 01:45:41,652
Sorry.

1103
01:45:42,537 --> 01:45:45,574
Does he light you up like this?
Does he make you laugh?

1104
01:45:46,417 --> 01:45:48,408
Nobody makes me laugh like this.

1105
01:45:48,497 --> 01:45:51,455
Good. Then admit it.
Admit that you love me.

1106
01:45:56,217 --> 01:45:58,606
Give me one kiss. That's all.

1107
01:45:59,097 --> 01:46:03,409
One quick kiss. Just one kiss
could not jeopardise a glorious marriage.

1108
01:46:04,537 --> 01:46:08,928
lt would also explain why your pulse just
jumped from 66 to 102 beats per minute.

1109
01:46:09,297 --> 01:46:12,607
Your respiration is doubled.
You're putting out clouds of pheromones.

1110
01:46:12,697 --> 01:46:16,007
-lt's not fair to read me like that.
-l know. Love isn't fair.

1111
01:46:16,097 --> 01:46:19,806
l'm reading your heart. l'm asking you
to follow it. Begging you.

1112
01:46:21,497 --> 01:46:24,409
Begging is supposed to be humiliating.
l don't care.

1113
01:46:24,497 --> 01:46:26,215
l love you, Portia.

1114
01:46:26,737 --> 01:46:29,251
l loved you the very first moment
l saw you.

1115
01:46:41,537 --> 01:46:43,971
-l thought you said a quick kiss.
-l lied!

1116
01:47:11,297 --> 01:47:12,616
How do you feel?

1117
01:47:14,097 --> 01:47:15,166
Wonderful.

1118
01:47:15,857 --> 01:47:16,972
So do l.

1119
01:47:18,417 --> 01:47:20,248
l guess that's the point.

1120
01:47:25,577 --> 01:47:26,771
What was that?

1121
01:47:27,177 --> 01:47:29,691
lt's your stomach growling. You're hungry.

1122
01:47:35,057 --> 01:47:36,729
-Was that me?
-Yes.

1123
01:47:36,817 --> 01:47:39,206
-l thought it was you.
-No, it wasn't me.

1124
01:47:39,297 --> 01:47:40,366
Really?

1125
01:47:42,137 --> 01:47:43,365
Do you do that?

1126
01:47:44,417 --> 01:47:46,931
Sometimes, but quieter than that.

1127
01:47:48,737 --> 01:47:51,251
l'll have to have Rupert make me a muffler.

1128
01:48:01,617 --> 01:48:02,936
lt's wonderful.

1129
01:48:03,217 --> 01:48:05,890
lt's wonderful,
the taste and the texture both.

1130
01:48:09,497 --> 01:48:10,612
lt's marvellous.

1131
01:48:10,697 --> 01:48:14,531
l know this will be my fourth helping,
but may l please have some more?

1132
01:48:16,017 --> 01:48:20,135
Pig. Very smart animal. Obviously
not that smart if it ends up as bacon.

1133
01:48:20,857 --> 01:48:24,167
l feel like l'm eating my way
through the entire food chain.

1134
01:48:24,377 --> 01:48:25,412
Thank you.

1135
01:48:32,137 --> 01:48:33,126
What?

1136
01:48:35,857 --> 01:48:37,256
What's wrong?

1137
01:48:39,777 --> 01:48:41,256
lf we're together...

1138
01:48:42,137 --> 01:48:45,527
...you and me, we'll never be accepted.

1139
01:48:48,577 --> 01:48:50,295
Because l'm not human.

1140
01:48:54,097 --> 01:48:55,689
That will not do.

1141
01:48:59,577 --> 01:49:02,296
-l will have to get started.
-Started with what?

1142
01:49:05,257 --> 01:49:06,406
The next step.

1143
01:49:07,017 --> 01:49:08,450
l love you.

1144
01:49:14,137 --> 01:49:15,536
Wish me luck.

1145
01:49:34,457 --> 01:49:36,448
Andrew Martin. Step forward, please.

1146
01:49:46,057 --> 01:49:47,490
So, Mr. Martin...

1147
01:49:47,737 --> 01:49:51,935
...you would like us to pass a bill
declaring you a human being.

1148
01:49:52,777 --> 01:49:57,487
Yes. Specifically, the ability
to marry a fellow human being.

1149
01:49:57,897 --> 01:49:58,932
l see.

1150
01:49:59,497 --> 01:50:01,488
We have to face the undeniable fact...

1151
01:50:01,577 --> 01:50:04,808
...that no matter how much you may be
like a human being...

1152
01:50:05,297 --> 01:50:07,811
...you are not part of the human gene pool.

1153
01:50:08,377 --> 01:50:11,449
You are outside of it entirely.
You are something else.

1154
01:50:12,217 --> 01:50:14,014
Something artificial.

1155
01:50:14,857 --> 01:50:18,896
Sir, what about all the real people
wading in the gene pool...

1156
01:50:19,337 --> 01:50:22,807
...who are full of prosthetic devices,
many of which l have invented?

1157
01:50:22,897 --> 01:50:25,889
You yourself, sir, have one of my kidneys,
do you not?

1158
01:50:26,857 --> 01:50:30,372
Are you not in some way artificial,
at least in part?

1159
01:50:31,657 --> 01:50:33,056
ln part, yes.

1160
01:50:34,217 --> 01:50:35,969
Then l'm human, in part.

1161
01:50:37,417 --> 01:50:38,816
Which part, Andrew?

1162
01:50:40,457 --> 01:50:41,890
This one, sir.

1163
01:50:42,937 --> 01:50:43,972
l see.

1164
01:50:44,537 --> 01:50:46,016
And here?

1165
01:50:48,777 --> 01:50:51,814
lt is true, l am still equipped
with a positronic brain.

1166
01:50:51,897 --> 01:50:57,369
And because of that positronic brain
you are, for all accounts, immortal.

1167
01:51:00,257 --> 01:51:01,406
Yes, sir.

1168
01:51:03,617 --> 01:51:07,166
Andrew, society can tolerate
an immortal robot...

1169
01:51:08,177 --> 01:51:10,975
...but we will never tolerate
an immortal human.

1170
01:51:11,657 --> 01:51:15,172
lt arouses too much jealousy,
too much anger.

1171
01:51:16,017 --> 01:51:17,416
l'm sorry, Andrew.

1172
01:51:17,577 --> 01:51:21,172
This court cannot and will not
validate your humanity.

1173
01:51:22,537 --> 01:51:25,097
l hereby bring an end to these proceedings.

1174
01:51:25,657 --> 01:51:30,333
lt is the decision of this court that
Andrew Martin, from this day forward...

1175
01:51:31,057 --> 01:51:34,606
...will continue to be declared a robot.

1176
01:51:36,137 --> 01:51:38,697
A mechanical machine, nothing more.

1177
01:51:43,217 --> 01:51:45,447
One is glad to be of service.

1178
01:52:12,977 --> 01:52:14,854
Andrew, l have to tell you...

1179
01:52:16,217 --> 01:52:18,447
...l'm beginning to feel not so sure.

1180
01:52:18,977 --> 01:52:20,012
About us?

1181
01:52:20,857 --> 01:52:21,733
No.

1182
01:52:24,337 --> 01:52:26,487
Next week will be my 75th birthday--

1183
01:52:26,577 --> 01:52:28,488
l know, and you look 50.

1184
01:52:29,377 --> 01:52:31,493
-Thank you.
-A spectacular 50.

1185
01:52:31,577 --> 01:52:33,056
But l don't feel 50.

1186
01:52:33,257 --> 01:52:36,533
Your body does. Last night was amazing.
What was that called again?

1187
01:52:36,617 --> 01:52:39,085
-Shut up and listen to me!
-Sorry.

1188
01:52:39,377 --> 01:52:41,937
Don't give me that look,
l'm not ordering you around.

1189
01:52:42,017 --> 01:52:43,769
-Whatever you say.
-Don't be agreeable.

1190
01:52:43,857 --> 01:52:46,371
l'm not being agreeable.
l can be if you want me to.

1191
01:52:46,457 --> 01:52:49,847
Goddamn it! l'm trying to tell you
something important here.

1192
01:52:57,737 --> 01:52:59,648
l'm not going to live forever.

1193
01:53:00,337 --> 01:53:01,611
Yes, you will.

1194
01:53:02,017 --> 01:53:04,133
-That's why l invented all--
-No, no.

1195
01:53:04,617 --> 01:53:07,051
l won't always take your DNA elixirs.

1196
01:53:07,617 --> 01:53:10,131
l won't have all my organs replaced.

1197
01:53:10,417 --> 01:53:12,931
Eventually, l'm going to wear out.

1198
01:53:13,337 --> 01:53:14,770
And l want to.

1199
01:53:16,537 --> 01:53:18,414
Why would you want to leave?

1200
01:53:22,057 --> 01:53:24,332
There's an order to things.

1201
01:53:25,977 --> 01:53:30,050
Human beings are meant to be here
for a certain time and then pass on.

1202
01:53:31,337 --> 01:53:33,089
That's what's right.

1203
01:53:34,897 --> 01:53:35,932
l see.

1204
01:53:37,697 --> 01:53:40,165
There's just one problem, Portia.

1205
01:53:41,577 --> 01:53:44,250
l couldn't stand to live without you.

1206
01:54:09,737 --> 01:54:12,205
Andrew, people grow through time.

1207
01:54:12,617 --> 01:54:16,087
But then, for you,
time is a completely different proposition.

1208
01:54:16,377 --> 01:54:19,289
For you, time is endless.

1209
01:54:30,657 --> 01:54:32,932
There is only one thing to do.

1210
01:54:56,257 --> 01:54:58,771
Galatea, my dear, where are we?

1211
01:54:59,577 --> 01:55:01,807
The transfusion is almost complete.

1212
01:55:01,897 --> 01:55:03,171
ls that so?

1213
01:55:05,177 --> 01:55:07,452
Just goes to show you, Andrew.

1214
01:55:08,697 --> 01:55:10,767
Somebody becomes a human being...

1215
01:55:11,177 --> 01:55:14,374
...sooner or later,
they do something monumentally stupid.

1216
01:55:15,257 --> 01:55:17,452
You've been a great example, Rupert.

1217
01:55:18,217 --> 01:55:20,777
How quickly will the blood
degrade my system?

1218
01:55:21,257 --> 01:55:22,610
l don't know.

1219
01:55:23,417 --> 01:55:27,490
You exercise, eat right, say, 30, 40 years.

1220
01:55:29,977 --> 01:55:34,050
That's a little vague, chief.
You don't know exactly how long l'll last?

1221
01:55:34,977 --> 01:55:36,012
Sorry.

1222
01:55:38,377 --> 01:55:40,288
Welcome to the human condition.

1223
01:55:50,097 --> 01:55:51,530
Andrew Martin?

1224
01:56:04,857 --> 01:56:07,815
l've always tried to make sense of things.

1225
01:56:08,857 --> 01:56:12,293
There must be some reason l am as l am.

1226
01:56:14,737 --> 01:56:19,686
As you can see, Madam Chairman,
l am no longer immortal.

1227
01:56:22,377 --> 01:56:24,413
You have arranged to die?

1228
01:56:24,857 --> 01:56:26,575
ln a sense, l have.

1229
01:56:28,577 --> 01:56:32,650
l am growing old
and my body is deteriorating.

1230
01:56:34,537 --> 01:56:38,894
And, like all of you,
it'll eventually cease to function.

1231
01:56:41,897 --> 01:56:44,889
As a robot l could have lived forever.

1232
01:56:48,337 --> 01:56:52,250
But l tell you all today
l would rather die a man...

1233
01:56:53,817 --> 01:56:56,889
...than live for all eternity as a machine.

1234
01:57:01,057 --> 01:57:02,809
Why do you want this?

1235
01:57:04,977 --> 01:57:09,050
To be acknowledged
for who and what l am...

1236
01:57:10,537 --> 01:57:12,255
...no more, no less...

1237
01:57:14,057 --> 01:57:16,571
...not for acclaim, not for approval...

1238
01:57:18,137 --> 01:57:20,697
...but the simple truth of that recognition.

1239
01:57:21,737 --> 01:57:25,093
This has been the elemental drive
of my existence.

1240
01:57:25,977 --> 01:57:27,729
And it must be achieved...

1241
01:57:27,977 --> 01:57:31,890
...if l am to live or die with dignity.

1242
01:57:45,137 --> 01:57:46,968
What you're asking for is...

1243
01:57:48,577 --> 01:57:51,137
...extremely complex and controversial.

1244
01:57:52,257 --> 01:57:54,646
lt will not be an easy decision.

1245
01:57:55,457 --> 01:57:57,368
l must ask for your patience...

1246
01:57:57,777 --> 01:58:00,689
...while l take the necessary time
to make a determination...

1247
01:58:00,777 --> 01:58:04,087
...of this extremely delicate matter.

1248
01:58:07,017 --> 01:58:10,009
Then l await your decision,
Madame Chairman.

1249
01:58:14,617 --> 01:58:16,812
Thank you for your patience.

1250
01:58:21,297 --> 01:58:22,446
We tried.

1251
01:58:36,537 --> 01:58:37,890
ls it almost time?

1252
01:58:39,017 --> 01:58:40,416
ln a few minutes.

1253
01:58:42,737 --> 01:58:45,331
lt doesn't matter what
the World Congress says.

1254
01:58:46,577 --> 01:58:48,932
Why do you need their approval?

1255
01:58:49,777 --> 01:58:51,005
Old habit.

1256
01:58:52,297 --> 01:58:57,246
l started my existence as a robot.
l still like to be told certain things.

1257
01:59:06,137 --> 01:59:07,365
lt's time.

1258
01:59:12,057 --> 01:59:13,376
Ladies and gentlemen...

1259
01:59:13,457 --> 01:59:16,529
...Miss Marjorie Botha,
President of the World Congress.

1260
01:59:16,977 --> 01:59:20,049
According to records of
the North Am Robotics company...

1261
01:59:20,337 --> 01:59:23,249
...the robot, also known as
Andrew Martin...

1262
01:59:23,657 --> 01:59:28,287
...was powered up at 5:15 p.m.
on April 3, 2005.

1263
01:59:29,817 --> 01:59:33,014
In a few hours, he will be 200 years old...

1264
01:59:34,017 --> 01:59:38,215
...which means with the exception of
Methuselah and other biblical figures...

1265
01:59:39,297 --> 01:59:43,210
...Andrew is the oldest living human being
in recorded history.

1266
01:59:44,017 --> 01:59:48,249
By this proclamation,
I validate his marriage to Portia Charney...

1267
01:59:48,737 --> 01:59:51,126
...and acknowledge his humanity.

1268
02:00:18,017 --> 02:00:19,769
l'm sorry he didn't see it.

1269
02:00:22,337 --> 02:00:24,293
Maybe he didn't need to.

1270
02:00:29,937 --> 02:00:31,893
Could you do me a favour?

1271
02:00:34,857 --> 02:00:37,087
Would you mind unplugging me?

1272
02:00:41,817 --> 02:00:43,375
That's an order.

1273
02:01:15,737 --> 02:01:17,455
Thank you, Galatea.

1274
02:01:19,137 --> 02:01:21,935
As the great Andrew Martin used to say:

1275
02:01:22,737 --> 02:01:25,092
''One is glad to be of service.''

1276
02:01:42,937 --> 02:01:44,336
See you soon.
