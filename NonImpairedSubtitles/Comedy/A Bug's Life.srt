How dare you ! You, sir,
are the charlatan in this scenario--

as a talent scout,

- Just go tell them the truth !
- They can't know the truth.
The truth, you see, is bad.

My children's children will
walk down the street,

goes the spawn of Flik, the loser !"

But if you could just do me
a little favor before you leave.

that would be great, because, uh,

Hardly there

1332
01:28:43,044 --> 01:28:46,241
How he felt, what he dreamed

1333
01:28:46,314 --> 01:28:48,248
Who would care

1334
01:28:50,651 --> 01:28:54,451
-  Without any evidence
-  His flaws were many, ooh

1335
01:28:54,522 --> 01:28:58,583
-  He was full of confidence
-  Some people haven't any

1336
01:28:58,659 --> 01:29:02,425
-  Didn't have much common sense
-  It's highly overrated

1337
01:29:02,497 --> 01:29:05,591
He just knew
that he'd come through

1338
01:29:05,666 --> 01:29:08,931
It's the time of your life

1339
01:29:09,003 --> 01:29:11,528
So live it well

1340
01:29:13,407 --> 01:29:16,399
It's the time of your life

1341
01:29:16,477 --> 01:29:18,843
So live it well

1342
01:29:21,115 --> 01:29:25,916
We may only go round one time

1343
01:29:25,987 --> 01:29:28,751
As far as I can tell

1344
01:29:28,823 --> 01:29:32,054
It's the time of your life

1345
01:29:32,126 --> 01:29:34,560
So live it well

1346
01:29:34,629 --> 01:29:39,430
We may only go round
this one time

1347
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:43,163
-  As far as I can tell
-  He could be wrong about me

1348
01:29:43,237 --> 01:29:46,365
-  It's the time of your life
-  Time, life

1349
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:50,171
-  It's the time of your life
-  Time, life

1350
01:29:50,244 --> 01:29:53,270
It's the time of your life

1351
01:29:53,347 --> 01:29:56,805
So live it well

1352
01:29:56,884 --> 01:29:58,818
- [ Beeping ]
- Speed !
- Marker.

1353
01:29:58,886 --> 01:30:02,185
- [ Director ] And-- action !
- Are you saying I'm stupid ?

1354
01:30:02,256 --> 01:30:05,521
- No !
- Do I look stupid... to you ?

1355
01:30:05,593 --> 01:30:07,788
[ Laughs Hysterically ]

1356
01:30:07,862 --> 01:30:09,796
- I'm sorry !
- [ Beeping ]

1357
01:30:09,864 --> 01:30:13,391
- Are you saying I'm stupid ? Oh--
- [ Laughing ]

1358
01:30:16,838 --> 01:30:20,205
- I'm sorry ! I got it.
No, no. Do it again. I'm fine.
- [ Beeping ]

1359
01:30:20,274 --> 01:30:24,267
- Are you saying I'm stupid ?
- Yes ! [ Laughing ]

1360
01:30:24,345 --> 01:30:28,145
This is the 15th take.
I cannot work like this.

1361
01:30:28,216 --> 01:30:31,583
- I will be in my trailer.
- I need a break.

1362
01:30:31,652 --> 01:30:33,586
- [ Beeping ]
- Marker.

1363
01:30:33,654 --> 01:30:36,885
-Whoa, Flik honey, we are not about to--
-[ Banging ]

1364
01:30:36,958 --> 01:30:38,892
- Is someone hammering ?
- [ Sighs ]

1365
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:40,894
-Could we hold the work, please? People?
-[ Ringing ]

1366
01:30:40,962 --> 01:30:42,953
Am I in this shot ?
You can see me, right ?

1367
01:30:43,030 --> 01:30:45,555
- [ Beeping ]
- And-- action !

1368
01:30:45,633 --> 01:30:48,568
To infinity, and beyond !

1369
01:30:48,636 --> 01:30:52,902
- [ Laughing ]
- I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.

1370
01:30:52,974 --> 01:30:54,908
Really, can you blame me ?

1371
01:30:54,976 --> 01:30:58,377
- Okay, let's go for real now. Sorry.
- Okay, cut !

1372
01:30:58,446 --> 01:31:01,074
Why go back to Ant Island at all ?

1373
01:31:01,148 --> 01:31:03,082
- I mean, you don't even like grain.
- What ?

1374
01:31:03,150 --> 01:31:05,084
You're right. I didn't think
it was such a good idea myself.

1375
01:31:05,152 --> 01:31:07,211
- Actually, it wasn't
even my idea. It was--
- Watch it !

1376
01:31:07,288 --> 01:31:09,688
- [ Crashing ]
- I'm sorry ! I'm sorry !
Is the camera broke ?

1377
01:31:09,757 --> 01:31:12,487
Oh, oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry. Did I ruin the take ?

1378
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:15,927
- [ Beeping ]
- And thank you for findin' 'em, Flik.

1379
01:31:15,997 --> 01:31:18,090
Me ? Oh, oops, ow, ow.

1380
01:31:18,165 --> 01:31:20,224
- Ow, ow, ow !
- Uh, oh, oh no. Oh no, oh--

1381
01:31:20,301 --> 01:31:23,168
- This really hurts, guys.
Can we cut ? Ow !
- I'm sorry, I'm s-- Oh !

1382
01:31:23,237 --> 01:31:24,670
[ Beeping ]

1383
01:31:24,739 --> 01:31:28,106
So, is there a Mrs. Ant
you have to tunnel home to ?

1384
01:31:28,175 --> 01:31:31,611
Oh, I'm sorry !
I thought he was real.

1385

1390
01:31:46,694 --> 01:31:49,356
Oh. No, no. Seriously,

1391
01:31:49,430 --> 01:31:52,228
- [ Laughing Fiendishly ]
- It stings ! Stop acting. I'm serious.

- [ Laughing ]
- [ Gurgling, Liquid Trickling ]

1394

01:32:06,514 --> 01:32:10,450
- [ Groaning ]
- Can we-- Can we cut ? It's just
I don't think I'm comin' across.

1399
01:32:10,518 --> 01:32:13,817
Hmm. Oh, oh, I know. I know.
I could lather up a bunch of spit.

1400
01:32:13,888 --> 01:32:16,789
Ooh, ooh, that's good.
I got it, J.L. One more for me.

1401

We may only go round one time

1409
01:32:43,417 --> 01:32:46,215
As far as I can tell

1410
01:32:46,287 --> 01:32:49,450
It's the time of your life

1411
01:32:49,523 --> 01:32:51,616
So live it well

1412
01:32:54,462 --> 01:32:57,863
Like us all he started small

1413
01:32:57,932 --> 01:32:59,866
Then he grew

1414
01:33:02,269 --> 01:33:05,636
When the time came he knew

1415
01:33:05,706 --> 01:33:07,640
What to do

1416
01:33:09,877 --> 01:33:13,904
-  He knew in order to succeed
-  They'd have to work together

1417
01:33:13,981 --> 01:33:17,747
-  He turned a rock into a seed
-  And they were changed forever

1418
01:33:17,818 --> 01:33:20,150
Then they had the strength
they'd need

1419
01:33:20,221 --> 01:33:24,920
-  To get through stormy weather
-  Do or die, you gotta try

1420
01:33:24,992 --> 01:33:28,155
It's the time of your life

So live it well

1428
01:33:54,622 --> 01:33:58,285
Isn't it a bit surprising

1429
01:33:58,359 --> 01:34:02,159
How our fortunes ebb and flow

1430
01:34:02,229 --> 01:34:06,097
And only to the enterprising

1431
01:34:06,167 --> 01:34:10,501
Does the magic fortune cookie go

1432
01:34:10,571 --> 01:34:14,598
Believe me
It's the time of your life
