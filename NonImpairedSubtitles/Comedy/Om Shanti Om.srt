1
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:26,965
O you side hero, what are you
doing? Rishi Kapoor is over there.

2
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:29,066
What do you do?
Are you the director?

3
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:31,502
If I were the director,
I would've thrown you out first.

4
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:41,447
O you hero!

5
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:42,949
Who?
Me?

6
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,184
Yes, you.

7
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,651
Is this your father's jacket that you've
put it on and trying to sneak out.

8
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:50,921
Why are you mentioning
my father, dress uncle?

9
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:53,257
Was your father Raj Kapoor?

10
00:04:53,341 --> 00:04:56,091
That he could stop our shooting.

11
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,862
Chintuji gave me the jacket
so I put it on.

12
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:03,583
No one can become a hero
by just wearing a jacket.

13
00:05:03,683 --> 00:05:05,852
There must be some looks.

14
00:05:05,952 --> 00:05:07,707
Give me jacket.

15
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,807
You've made a mess
of this jacket.

16
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:14,847
Look at this dress uncle.

17
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:21,236
Don't mind him. He's just a drunk
can't see a future superstar.

18
00:05:21,336 --> 00:05:22,956
Superstar!

19
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:24,090
Will I become a hero?

20
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,491
Why not?

21
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:27,460
You will surely become a hero.

22
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,641
My mom says that too.

23
00:05:29,741 --> 00:05:31,945
Keshtu Mukherjee's mother
also says the same.

24
00:05:32,045 --> 00:05:34,545
Really?
- Mother's all same.

25
00:05:34,645 --> 00:05:36,918
But you'll become a hero.

26
00:05:37,018 --> 00:05:40,518
Because I, Pappu Master, saying...

27
00:05:40,618 --> 00:05:42,836
that you will become a hero.

28
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:49,012
You have everything,
style, hairstyle, race, face...

29
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:52,049
and extreme talent.

30
00:05:52,133 --> 00:05:54,133
But there's just one thing coming
between you and your stardom.

31
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:00,827
What's that?

32
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:02,927
Your name.

33
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:04,731
My name?

34
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:06,232
- Om Prakash Makhija

35
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:08,650
your bill is due for two months.
When will you pay?

36
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,902
I will...

37
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:11,237
in this lifetime or the next?

38
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:14,087
Your cream roll also is not
from this lifetime.

39
00:06:14,187 --> 00:06:15,775
You've been selling it
since the times of Alam Ara.

40
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,957
You'll see Pappu.
When I'll become a big star...

41
00:06:19,057 --> 00:06:21,193
I'll get his canteen shut.

42
00:06:21,293 --> 00:06:23,293
Remember my name.

43
00:06:23,371 --> 00:06:25,716
Om Prakash Makhija.

44
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,602
Just "Om Prakash" can do the job.

45
00:06:30,702 --> 00:06:34,638
But this "Makhija"...
you can't become star with this.

46
00:06:34,738 --> 00:06:35,962
Really?
- No.

47
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:39,015
Look, who's coming.

48
00:06:39,115 --> 00:06:41,115
Come here.

49
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:42,302
What's your name?

50
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,402
Govind Ahuja.

51
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:48,675
What kind of name this is?

52
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:50,310
You can't get a job
with this name.

53
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,160
Do one thing. Change your
name with, Rohan Kapoor,

54
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,914
Raj Kiran, something like that.

55
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:57,014
You'll see producers will
line up for you.

56
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,090
What if I use just "Govinda"?

57
00:06:59,133 --> 00:07:02,248
Lets try.
- Thank you...

58
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,089
you're right Pappu.

59
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:08,094
My father had no
other name for me.

60
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:13,143
There're many big stars in the industry.
Rajinder, Jitender, and Dharminder.

61
00:07:13,243 --> 00:07:16,030
And what he chose...
Om Prakash.

62
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,091
Here comes our favorite.

63
00:07:26,191 --> 00:07:28,340
Rajesh Kapoor.

64
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:41,340
This the name of a hero.
Kapoor...

65
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,196
name has the weight.

66
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:46,311
Now do one thing. Remove this
"Makhija" from your name and

67
00:07:46,411 --> 00:07:48,424
put Kumar, Kapoor, Khanna
or something.

68
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:52,855
Then you'll see. How shot of
your luck gets ok in first take.

69
00:07:52,955 --> 00:07:55,757
Ok.
I could change my name today but...

70
00:07:55,857 --> 00:07:58,058
you know...

71
00:07:58,158 --> 00:08:00,158
what will Mom say?

72
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:05,181
No...

73
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:08,354
hey Lord,

74
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:10,156
what I'm hearing.

75
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:12,405
My lovely son,

76
00:08:12,505 --> 00:08:13,860
my Om,

77
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,628
wants to change his name.

78
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:19,046
I ask, what's wrong
with this name?

79
00:08:19,146 --> 00:08:22,285
We remember Lord
by saying "Om".

80
00:08:22,385 --> 00:08:24,895
We remove darkness by
saying "Prakash".

81
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:26,372
And with "Makhija"...

82
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:28,736
we remove flies by
saying "Makhija".

83
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:32,209
I can live with "Om" and "Prakash",

84
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,895
but with "Makhija" as my name,
I can never become a hero.

85
00:08:35,995 --> 00:08:37,250
Never...

86
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,085
you will my son.

87
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:42,200
You'll surely become a hero one day.

88
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,023
That's what my heart says.

89
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:45,792
A mother's heart says.

90
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:47,892
To hell with a mother's heart.

91
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:51,043
I can't become a hero in this
lifetime with this name.

92
00:08:51,143 --> 00:08:54,429
I'll die doing job as a junior artist.

93
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:59,103
Like father.

94
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:03,409
O father of Om Prakash!

95
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:06,729
It's good that you're dead
before hearing all this.

96
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:09,293
Gods!
How much you're over-acting?

97
00:09:09,393 --> 00:09:11,463
Now I get this, why you
couldn't become a heroine.

98
00:09:11,563 --> 00:09:14,370
What's this?
Me and over-acting?

99
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:17,173
You know, K. Asif called me.

100
00:09:17,273 --> 00:09:18,925
For screen test.

101
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,043
If you weren't in my womb
at that time.

102
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:25,812
Mughal-e-Azam's Anarkali wouldn't
have been Madhubala but Bela Makhija.

103
00:09:25,912 --> 00:09:27,366
Your mother.

104
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:30,149
Madhu also handled it well.

105
00:09:30,249 --> 00:09:32,418
But if I was Anarkali...

106
00:09:32,518 --> 00:09:35,154
then it wouldn't be Mughal-e-Azam
but Flop-e-Azam.

107
00:09:35,254 --> 00:09:36,375
Flop-e-Azam, Mom.

108
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:39,376
The truth is...
you're a junior artist.

109
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,513
Father was a junior artist too.

110
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:46,779
And maybe I'll remain a
junior artist as well.

111
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:49,286
Leave me alone.

112
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:51,958
Om, stop son.

113
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:53,392
I've made kheer. (sweet milk)

114
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:55,973
Stupid, he's mad.

115
00:09:56,073 --> 00:09:58,312
What's mummy?
Why are you standing like this?

116
00:09:58,412 --> 00:10:01,412
Look, Pappu, your stupid friend
again fought and left.

117
00:10:01,512 --> 00:10:03,169
He didn't even stop for kheer.

118
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,269
Not even for kheer?

119
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:09,206
Then he must have gone to
the bridge to see his girlfriend.

120
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:12,044
Girlfriend?

121
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:14,144
Shanti are you fine?

122
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:17,414
All's well?

123
00:10:17,507 --> 00:10:19,883
You know why I always come to you.

124
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,953
Because you're my only strength.

125
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,824
You're my courage, my inspiration,
my dream.

126
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,072
You're my path and
you're my destination.

127
00:10:27,172 --> 00:10:31,310
You...

128
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:33,410
I hope you're not
getting bored.

129
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,237
You know that.

130
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:39,505
How good an actor I am.

131
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:42,322
Mom and Pappu also say
that I'll become a big star.

132
00:10:42,422 --> 00:10:45,024
But I want to become a star
only for you.

133
00:10:45,124 --> 00:10:47,978
That I could stand with you.
And alongside you, I could say...

134
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:52,848
hey...
aren't you getting bored?

135
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,221
Thanks.

136
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,321
This is the best quality of yours.
That I keep on talking and...

137
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:00,524
you never get bored.

138
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:02,395
You keep on smiling.

139
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:05,313
I know that you're a dream girl
of millions of your fans.

140
00:11:05,413 --> 00:11:07,133
But know one thing.

141
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:10,259
No one will love you more
then me in this whole world.

142
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:11,871
And yes.

143
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:14,356
Instead of Shanti Priya superstar,

144
00:11:14,456 --> 00:11:16,555
If you were Shanti Priya super
junior artist,

145
00:11:16,655 --> 00:11:18,995
I would still be loving you like this.

146
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:22,965
And you will see.
One day we will meet.

147
00:11:23,065 --> 00:11:25,313
And that day is not far, my friend.

148
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:28,652
Pappu, mom, when did you come?

149
00:11:28,736 --> 00:11:29,522
Why didn't you say anything?

150
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:31,457
Didn't feel the need.

151
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:34,206
Let me see my daughter-in-law.

152
00:11:34,306 --> 00:11:37,274
She's a jewel.

153
00:11:37,374 --> 00:11:38,864
Mom, you are too much.

154
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:41,917
Please forgive me today.

155
00:11:42,017 --> 00:11:43,836
I spoke nonsense in anger.

156
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:48,357
No, my son.
You'll become a hero one day.

157
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:51,427
Your face will be put
on a poster like this.

158
00:11:51,527 --> 00:11:53,312
That's what my heart says.

159
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:54,947
A mother's heart says...

160
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,882
that ran for 25 weeks.
Silver jubilees.

161
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:57,516
Shut up.

162
00:11:57,616 --> 00:12:00,265
Mothers' hearts are all same.

163
00:12:00,365 --> 00:12:01,454
Yes.

164
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:05,081
Here son, it's thread from
Sai Baba of Shirdi.

165
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:09,040
Baba will definitely fulfill
your desires.

166
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,378
You'll soon meet Shanti.

167
00:12:11,478 --> 00:12:13,478
Really?
- Really.

168
00:12:13,578 --> 00:12:16,519
And this can happen
just tonight.

169
00:12:16,619 --> 00:12:17,903
Tonight?

170
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:20,003
What's tonight.

171
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:02,648
He touched me.
- That's great.

172
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:06,013
How do I look?
- We always look good in rented clothes.

173
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,459
When will you announce the
good news?

174
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,976
Good news is coming next week.

175
00:13:19,076 --> 00:13:22,051
I am sure like the previous year,

176
00:13:22,151 --> 00:13:26,504
I will get the best actor
award this year too.

177
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:30,456
She's asking about the
other good news.

178
00:13:30,556 --> 00:13:32,556
What other good news?

179
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:37,505
Oh! Baby?
That will be soon.

180
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:43,647
Now here comes,
the star of the evening.

181
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:47,354
The dreamy girl herself.

182
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,327
Shanti Priya.

183
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,262
What are you doing?
He's a super star.

184
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:37,795
You done great my lion.
You've grabbed her scarf.

185
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:40,737
Will you keep on standing here?
Don't we have to see the movie?

186
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:42,830
But who will let us in?

187
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,778
Here's the tickets.

188
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:47,112
Trick worked today.

189
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:48,214
But these are...

190
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:50,680
I know that. I slipped them
while taking autograph.

191
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,850
Let's go.

192
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:58,422
Mr. Manoj Kumar...
please come.

193
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,351
Hail Mother India.

194
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:22,345
Ramesh Babu, you can't understand the
value of just a little bit of "Sindoor".

195
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:26,402
It's god's blessings, just a
little bit of Sindoor.

196
00:16:26,502 --> 00:16:27,653
Pushpaa!

197
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:31,689
It's the pride of married
woman, a little bit of Sindoor.

198
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:41,232
It's the dream of every woman.
...a little bit of Sindoor.

199
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:47,537
O Pushpaa!

200
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,175
Don't do that.

201
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:53,357
Look ahead dude.
If real Manoj Kumar comes,

202
00:16:53,457 --> 00:16:54,413
we will get a good beating.

203
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:57,730
No, Mr. Manoj Kumar is a nice
man, he won't say anything.

204
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:01,980
Madam, believe me,
I am Manoj Kumar.

205
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:03,789
Security, check him.

206
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,889
Here's my driving license.

207
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:12,559
You're lying...

208
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:10,350
Ramesh Babu, you can't understand the
value of just a little bit of "Sindoor".

209
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:14,840
It's god's blessings, just a
little bit of Sindoor.

210
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,694
Great!

211
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:19,647
It's the pride of married
woman, a little bit of Sindoor.

212
00:23:19,747 --> 00:23:20,532
Great

213
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:25,587
It's the dream of every woman.
...a little bit of Sindoor.

214
00:23:25,687 --> 00:23:29,321
Great...
clap for him.

215
00:23:29,421 --> 00:23:31,421
That's wonderful.

216
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:37,098
This year's Filmfare award
will be given to your sister-in-law.

217
00:23:37,198 --> 00:23:41,807
Yes, but if award jury was here,
they would have given you award.

218
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:44,888
Really?
- Yes.

219
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,980
Will I get award when
I'll become a star?

220
00:23:47,071 --> 00:23:49,325
Of course.

221
00:23:50,397 --> 00:23:55,783
When I'll become a star
I'll buy this bungalow.

222
00:23:55,883 --> 00:23:57,636
You will.

223
00:23:57,736 --> 00:24:01,656
Right now, it belongs
to that Rajesh Kapoor.

224
00:24:01,756 --> 00:24:03,756
One day it will be mine.

225
00:24:03,841 --> 00:24:07,290
Rajesh Kapoor lives like a poor man.

226
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:08,880
I will live in style.

227
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:09,981
Style.

228
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:12,345
There will be 15-16 imported cars.
- Style.

229
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:14,945
There will be 50-60 servants.
- Style.

230
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:20,017
And there will be bedroom with
round bed like Yash Chopra's set.

231
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:21,827
In style.

232
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:23,927
When I'll wake up in the morning,

233
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:28,422
before putting my foot on the
marble floor, one servant...

234
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:32,726
will put soft slippers in my foot.

235
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:36,439
Do you know what the
second servant will do?

236
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:40,105
He'll put the silk gown like
Raj Kumar's on me.

237
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:44,444
And the third one will
stand on side with juice for me.

238
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:47,016
What happened?

239
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:50,688
You've made me cry?
- Why? What happened?

240
00:24:51,789 --> 00:24:57,084
You'll get the Filmfare award
later, but right now

241
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,830
press...
take photos.

242
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:09,690
I've also wrote a speech
for this award.

243
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,790
Should I say here?

244
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,211
Ladies and Gentlemen.

245
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:26,486
I have tried that hard
to have you.

246
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:32,719
That everything has conspired
to get me meet with you.

247
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:40,264
I couldn't understand anything.

248
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:43,439
Should I make it simple?
- A bit.

249
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:48,276
Ladies and Gentlemen.

250
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:53,768
It's being said, that if you sincerely
want someone to be yours...

251
00:25:53,868 --> 00:25:58,414
all the universe starts turning
things to get you meet with them.

252
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:04,276
You all have made
me meet with my love.

253
00:26:04,376 --> 00:26:05,997
Thanks.

254
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:07,165
Thanks very much.

255
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:10,757
I feel like the King
of the World.

256
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:16,190
I have believed today that...

257
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:20,127
like our movies, our lives

258
00:26:20,227 --> 00:26:25,148
also get all right till the end.

259
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,585
Happy endings.

260
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:32,107
If it's not all right.

261
00:26:32,207 --> 00:26:34,207
It's not "the end".

262
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:42,355
Film is still unfinished.

263
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,866
I love you,
I love you all.

264
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:49,452
Shut up.
What nonsense you're speaking?

265
00:26:49,552 --> 00:26:50,809
I love you man.

266
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:52,277
Get away from here.

267
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:54,377
Look him, what's he saying?

268
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:58,328
Hey drunk! Don't you know him?

269
00:26:58,428 --> 00:26:59,985
Who are you?

270
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:02,233
He's the superstar Om.

271
00:27:02,333 --> 00:27:05,050
You didn't recognize him,
he's Manoj Kumar.

272
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:07,857
Then I'm Dara Singh.

273
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:33,016
Have you come son?

274
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,056
Yes.
- It's too late.

275
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:39,824
I was scared.

276
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:42,324
Oh my filmi mother!

277
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:45,228
What's to get scared?

278
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:48,213
No matter how late.

279
00:27:48,313 --> 00:27:50,035
But I will come home.

280
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:51,403
To you.

281
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:56,987
Come on, get fresh,
I'll bring dinner for you.

282
00:27:57,087 --> 00:27:59,861
No, I've had my dinner.

283
00:27:59,961 --> 00:28:01,961
And drink too.

284
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:06,084
Forgive me today.

285
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,552
I'm sorry.

286
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:12,006
Like you always say that,
this moon...

287
00:28:12,106 --> 00:28:14,106
who moon?

288
00:28:14,592 --> 00:28:16,592
The moon on the sky.

289
00:28:21,933 --> 00:28:24,352
Like you always say

290
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:26,452
that this moon isn't a moon,
it's a dream

291
00:28:26,528 --> 00:28:28,528
that you have seen it for me.

292
00:28:29,574 --> 00:28:33,271
Tonight I've touched that dream.

293
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:36,312
With these very hands.

294
00:28:36,388 --> 00:28:37,582
Really?

295
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:39,050
Really.

296
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,885
My prince.

297
00:28:40,985 --> 00:28:43,385
Now go to bed, don't you have
to go for shooting in the morning.

298
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:51,375
Makeup man fixed the mustache too
tight that I can't open my mouth.

299
00:28:51,475 --> 00:28:53,475
How I'm going to say my dialogues?

300
00:28:53,562 --> 00:28:56,147
But good thing is no
one will recognize you.

301
00:28:56,247 --> 00:28:57,869
See that's why I've put
a mole on my face.

302
00:28:57,969 --> 00:28:59,537
It's amazing, you are
absolutely unrecognizable.

303
00:28:59,637 --> 00:29:00,639
Assistant Director.

304
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,273
Should I do everything?

305
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:06,139
Assistant Director, find out
what's the scene here.

306
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:08,380
And what are my dialogues.

307
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,711
Scenes is that, there will
be a fire in these fields.

308
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:12,951
Actions.

309
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:15,212
Your dialogue is "run".

310
00:29:15,386 --> 00:29:17,386
And then?

311
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:20,556
Is that it?
"Run".

312
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:22,627
Just "run".

313
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:24,029
It's a lame dialogue.

314
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:25,363
Lame?
I wrote it.

315
00:29:25,463 --> 00:29:27,649
Great, what a dialogue?

316
00:29:27,749 --> 00:29:30,050
I think the hall will be blown.

317
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:33,229
But there should be some
powerful heroic dialogues.

318
00:29:34,405 --> 00:29:36,419
Heroic dialogues will be
spoken by the hero.

319
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:39,272
Which is not you. There's
the hero "Vicky Sandhu".

320
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:48,209
Call the producer.
- That director has gone mad again.

321
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:54,056
Vicky Sandu...
bastard...

322
00:29:55,593 --> 00:29:57,593
see the problems with the heroine.

323
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:01,646
Shot's ready and she says she'll
work only after the producer comes.

324
00:30:01,746 --> 00:30:04,652
She's asking me,
the biggest director.

325
00:30:04,752 --> 00:30:07,588
She's telling me she'll work
only after seeing the producer.

326
00:30:07,688 --> 00:30:09,688
Call Mr. Mukesh.

327
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:11,710
What's going on?

328
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,594
It's the same. Heroine isn't
coming out of the tent.

329
00:30:14,694 --> 00:30:16,694
She might not have been
paid in last shoot.

330
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:19,696
No, it's Mukesh Mehra's film.
He's a big producer.

331
00:30:19,796 --> 00:30:22,068
Be it big or small producer.

332
00:30:22,168 --> 00:30:25,039
Those stars have been treating
producers like dogs.

333
00:30:25,139 --> 00:30:26,124
What did you say?
- Controls.

334
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:28,224
Our Shanti is not like that.

335
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:32,088
Yes, even Mukesh Mehra
gave her first break.

336
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:35,464
"Bali umar ko salaam"

337
00:30:35,557 --> 00:30:38,024
Shanti was just 16 years
old back then.

338
00:30:41,105 --> 00:30:43,105
Mr. Mukesh has come.

339
00:30:54,118 --> 00:30:56,118
Now see, the shooting
will start in 10 minutes.

340
00:31:00,758 --> 00:31:02,293
Mr. Mukesh is handsome.

341
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:03,361
What a personality.

342
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:05,461
He's dashing.

343
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:09,498
Why doesn't he becomes
a hero, he's tall.

344
00:31:09,574 --> 00:31:11,574
Smarty pants.

345
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:27,467
We never become bandits for
any producers,

346
00:31:27,567 --> 00:31:30,316
It's just because of
Mr. Mukesh.

347
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:34,156
You're having too much cough.

348
00:31:34,692 --> 00:31:37,173
Shanti will be ready in 10
minutes, get your shot ready.

349
00:31:37,273 --> 00:31:38,730
Very good problem solved.

350
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:42,115
It's bad for my creativity.

351
00:31:42,215 --> 00:31:45,248
Don't cry for every little thing.

352
00:31:45,348 --> 00:31:47,817
It's Bombay, it's like this here.

353
00:31:47,917 --> 00:31:51,292
This whole scene should
be done today.

354
00:31:51,392 --> 00:31:54,095
Of course, I've put three
cameras.

355
00:31:54,195 --> 00:31:55,814
One Satyajit Ray angle.

356
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,282
One Bimal Roy angle,

357
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:59,150
and one Guru Dutt angle.

358
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,501
Put one Manmohan Desai
angle, that will work.

359
00:32:02,601 --> 00:32:04,601
Understood?

360
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:19,537
You took too long.

361
00:32:19,637 --> 00:32:21,718
By the way what are you
doing after pack-up?

362
00:32:21,818 --> 00:32:23,141
Suicide.

363
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:25,709
I'm also ready to die.

364
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:32,882
Sir, you are in the field.

365
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,360
Sirju.

366
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:48,297
Run

367
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,662
run

368
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:56,933
run

369
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,281
Sirju, it's your shot.

370
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:04,849
Jump into the fire.

371
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:07,702
Fire is too hot, let it
cool down, I will jump.

372
00:33:07,802 --> 00:33:10,638
What the hell is happening?
Someone save me.

373
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:12,523
Sir, cut the scene,
Sirju is not jumping in the fire.

374
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:14,907
No, I won't cut until
the shot is cleared.

375
00:33:15,007 --> 00:33:16,828
Producer has asked
me to finish the scene today.

376
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:18,953
Someone help me.

377
00:33:20,698 --> 00:33:23,780
In the shooting of Mother India,
Sunil Dutt saved Nargis like this.

378
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,436
They both got married later on.

379
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:27,536
But I'm already married,
what's my gain in this.

380
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:30,532
Help me.

381
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:33,626
Shanti is alone there,
please go and save her.

382
00:33:33,726 --> 00:33:36,703
If you care about her then
you go ahead and save her.

383
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,188
Someone say "cut".

384
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:46,381
Someone jump in the fire.

385
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:13,772
Doctor can't you reduce your
fee? You came for half shift.

386
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,080
Is it painful?
- Yes.

387
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:21,352
Look here I'm talking to you.

388
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:24,804
If something happened to you,
what could I tell your mom?

389
00:35:24,904 --> 00:35:27,004
Look here I'm talking to you.

390
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:29,104
But Shanti was in fire...
- to hell with Shanti...

391
00:35:29,182 --> 00:35:31,182
there were many to save her.

392
00:35:31,219 --> 00:35:33,219
Who was coming to save you?

393
00:35:33,229 --> 00:35:35,349
Look here I'm talking to you.

394
00:35:35,449 --> 00:35:36,634
Then why are you moving
here and there?

395
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:37,835
Shut up.

396
00:35:37,935 --> 00:35:40,321
Thank god that you were
burned only on the back.

397
00:35:40,421 --> 00:35:42,756
If your face was burned, then
not only you couldn't

398
00:35:42,856 --> 00:35:44,409
become a superstar,
but you would have to

399
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:46,377
work in horror films.

400
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,477
I would have.

401
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,815
What could have happened?

402
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:56,544
I would have burned, died.

403
00:35:58,422 --> 00:36:00,686
I didn't think anything at
that moment.

404
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:04,887
I just saw a wall of fire
and behind that trapped Shanti.

405
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:08,783
You know, if required,
I'll jump not just once,

406
00:36:08,883 --> 00:36:11,049
not ten times, not hundred
times but thousand times

407
00:36:11,149 --> 00:36:14,662
in the fires where Shanti is trapped.

408
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:21,111
In front of Shanti's life,
my dreams are nothing.

409
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:25,481
Nothing matters.

410
00:36:27,785 --> 00:36:29,785
Now look here.

411
00:36:29,861 --> 00:36:31,861
Look here.

412
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:34,990
What are you doing like this?

413
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:42,824
I've met many people.

414
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:47,167
But none of them did
anything like this.

415
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:49,891
That you did for me
being just a stranger.

416
00:36:49,991 --> 00:36:51,991
I'm a stranger to you.

417
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:53,911
But for me you're a part
of myself

418
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:56,631
without that I'm incomplete.

419
00:36:56,731 --> 00:36:58,740
What's your name?

420
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,800
My name is the one who
always with Shanti.

421
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:03,955
Om

422
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,908
before Shanti and
after Shanti.

423
00:37:07,008 --> 00:37:10,405
Look, I know you're not mute.

424
00:37:10,505 --> 00:37:13,759
If you won't tell me your name,
how I will thank you.

425
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:16,868
Om

426
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:18,968
Shanti
- Om

427
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:23,691
I think I've seen you before.

428
00:37:23,791 --> 00:37:26,209
Yes, maybe on that premiere
that night.

429
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:27,411
On posters.

430
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:30,025
You must have seen
his film's posters.

431
00:37:30,125 --> 00:37:31,082
Madras Raja

432
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:34,866
he's rising star of south,
Omoswami Shanti Nathan.

433
00:37:34,966 --> 00:37:35,686
Who Omoswami?

434
00:37:35,786 --> 00:37:36,787
You, who else.

435
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:38,912
He's too down to earth.

436
00:37:40,157 --> 00:37:43,110
Who would believe his
first film was a golden jubilee.

437
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:44,495
Really?
- Really?

438
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:45,530
Really.

439
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,630
You'll see, Shanti Ji.

440
00:37:47,706 --> 00:37:51,052
Very soon our Om will dominate
all of the Bombay industry.

441
00:37:51,152 --> 00:37:52,837
Really?
- Really.

442
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,937
Of course.

443
00:37:57,141 --> 00:37:59,526
By the way, you have
earned your first fan today.

444
00:37:59,626 --> 00:38:02,996
Not fan, a friend Shanti Ji.

445
00:38:03,096 --> 00:38:05,096
Not Shanti Ji, just Shanti.

446
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:09,954
Can I go?

447
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:12,054
Okay

448
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:18,877
there's rule in friendship.

449
00:38:18,977 --> 00:38:21,488
No sorry, no thank you.

450
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:25,970
Is this a dialogue from a film?

451
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:29,699
Not yet.
Om write his dialogues himself.

452
00:38:33,911 --> 00:38:37,128
Madam, no sorry, no thank you.

453
00:38:37,228 --> 00:38:41,000
Son, what are you doing here?
Our set is over there.

454
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,100
Daddy, I was writing dialogues.

455
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:24,093
Wow, how he acts!

456
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:26,729
Wow, how he acts!

457
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:55,023
Wow, how he acts!

458
00:39:55,116 --> 00:39:57,116
Wow, how he acts!

459
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:06,801
Tiger cat.

460
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:09,872
Tiger...
what a tiger.

461
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:12,143
Oh, you bad cat.

462
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,711
You fat cat.

463
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:15,811
Rascal cat.

464
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:18,282
Take it.

465
00:40:18,382 --> 00:40:19,583
Take it.

466
00:40:19,683 --> 00:40:21,683
Take it...

467
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:24,787
who's your daddy now?

468
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,089
You want to say sorry?

469
00:40:27,165 --> 00:40:29,321
Pussy cat, pussy cat.
Where have you been?

470
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,795
Have you been to London?

471
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:31,962
To see the queen.

472
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:34,062
Go see the queen.

473
00:40:38,302 --> 00:40:40,302
Find it.

474
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:44,140
Are you fly you are not toy.

475
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:55,717
How nice he flying.

476
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:57,810
How nice he flying.

477
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:11,363
You rascal!
Mind it.

478
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,096
Cut it.
Super hit.

479
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,007
What an acting Sir.

480
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:18,109
What an acting Sir.

481
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:19,677
Hey you go away only
one line you remind.

482
00:41:19,777 --> 00:41:20,611
Gabru is she coming?

483
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:21,178
Yes, she is coming here.

484
00:41:21,278 --> 00:41:22,246
You just give autographs.

485
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:22,947
Yes, I'm doing.

486
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:25,379
Yes, yes, go.

487
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:28,884
Naran Lalla. Shiva Ji Ganeshan.

488
00:41:29,118 --> 00:41:30,287
Kamla Hassan.

00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,206
Its not a big shot.

495
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:51,306
You see my next dead shot.

496
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:53,475
I acts die real.

497

498
00:41:57,281 --> 00:41:59,281
My on the spot.

499
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:01,416
And the main thing is that.

500
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:03,053
I die in which movie.

501
00:42:03,153 --> 00:42:04,355
It goes super hit.

502
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:06,190
Four times I am dying in this movie.

503
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:07,191
Four times.

504
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:07,858
Its double role Sir

505
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:08,692
its double role.

506
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:10,327
Twin brothers.

507
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:12,427
Before interval villain kill us.

508
00:42:13,163 --> 00:42:15,163
But after interval we have born again.

509
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:19,230
And at climax we kill the
villain and die again.

510
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,538
Mind it.

511
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:28,002
I am seeing first time
who dies four times.

512
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,346
Thank you.

513
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:31,446
I like everything about movie.

514
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:35,216
Action, lights, costume, autograph.

515
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:42,491
Are you bored?

516
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:44,826
Nothing.

517
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:48,297
Nice.

518
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,866

Hey find who tells pack up?

522
00:42:58,008 --> 00:42:59,310
Break time is over now.

523
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:01,410
Shiva come everyman.

524
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:04,006

525
00:43:04,481 --> 00:43:06,481
Come come.

526
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:13,255
Easy man.

527
00:43:13,824 --> 00:43:14,758
Give me the watch.

528
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:16,858
Its mine.

529
00:43:18,162 --> 00:43:20,162
No it's really mine.

530
00:43:22,466 --> 00:43:24,466
Please forgive me Shanti.

531
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:29,104
I am lying to you.

532
00:43:29,197 --> 00:43:30,774
But what can I do?

533
00:43:30,874 --> 00:43:32,874
You are the biggest star.

534
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:36,011
And I am only a junior artist.

535
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,880
Who tell this you are a
junior artist?

536
00:43:41,986 --> 00:43:43,986
Om you jumped in fire to me.

537
00:43:46,323 --> 00:43:48,323
You are a hero.

538
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,019
And if I can do anything to you.

539
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:55,097
Then it's my pleasure.

540
00:43:55,232 --> 00:43:57,351
But I can't jump in fire.

541
00:43:57,451 --> 00:43:59,451
No, no.

542
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:02,940
You can do this but.

543
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,941
It's like to jump in fire to you.

544
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:14,473
Brother, why I feel that
she not comes.

545
00:44:15,552 --> 00:44:17,154
I feel it too.

546
00:44:17,254 --> 00:44:19,254
I am joking man she will come.

547
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:21,992
Have you fixed it all?

548
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:23,794
Yes, it's ok.

549
00:44:23,894 --> 00:44:25,894
And like this she can't forget it.

550
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,232
Good luck.

551
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,857
Which promise have you done?

552
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:34,034
You have to complete it.

553
00:44:35,105 --> 00:44:37,505
If world will stops you.

554
00:44:39,376 --> 00:44:39,910
Sister.

555
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,312
Who's Om Prakash?

556
00:44:41,412 --> 00:44:43,412
If you want to give then it's me.
And if you want to take then he is.

557
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,880
No, Shanti brings me here.

558
00:44:46,483 --> 00:44:48,610
She is very sad to not come here.

559
00:44:51,555 --> 00:44:53,190
Have you seen Pappu.

560
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:55,290
Break my heart with a style.

561
00:44:55,374 --> 00:44:56,160
Leave me man.

562
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:58,128
Just ask for an evening.

563
00:44:58,228 --> 00:44:59,363
Nothing to break any mountain.

564
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:02,455
Go and tell her.

565
00:45:04,601 --> 00:45:06,601
Don't do this again with anybody.

566
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:12,274
It's my heart not a bangle.
Broke it yet.

567
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:17,137
You say yourself.
Your prison is here.

568
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:30,094
I was told him.

569
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:31,028
You have to come.

570
00:45:31,128 --> 00:45:32,096
But he fool tells me that
you can't come.

571
00:45:32,196 --> 00:45:34,391
What rubbish you talking?
I was told you she has to come.

572
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,400
Cut it, cut it.

573
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:41,967
How I can't come.
I had a friendship.

574
00:45:42,439 --> 00:45:44,439
And it's to bear.

575
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:51,980
You tell me no to
say thank you.

576
00:45:52,549 --> 00:45:54,549
Don't ignore it.

577
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:08,839
Do you know Om?

578
00:50:08,939 --> 00:50:10,939
I don't remember when
was I was glad like this.

579
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:12,809
But not like me.

580
00:50:12,909 --> 00:50:14,909
Do you see ever the Seventh Sky?

581
00:50:15,245 --> 00:50:17,543
Here in my foot.

582
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:22,452
So you can't get upset ever?

583
00:50:22,552 --> 00:50:24,552
Nothing ever.

584
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:27,389
And if I will.

585
00:50:27,481 --> 00:50:28,926
Then I see your picture.

586
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:31,688
Because its the divert name
of happiness to me Shanti.

587
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:34,496
The heart beat of everyone.

588
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,865
Whole world loves her.

589
00:50:44,274 --> 00:50:46,367
But worlds love will
short some time.

590
00:50:48,645 --> 00:50:51,739
That's enough to get
love from once.

591
00:50:55,919 --> 00:50:58,012
Just put your hand at once.

592
00:50:58,855 --> 00:51:00,855
You get your wish.

593
00:51:02,292 --> 00:51:05,261
It's your own to get every
pleasure of this world.

594
00:51:06,596 --> 00:51:08,596
Just once you show yours.

595
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,900
Then you not find happiness.

596
00:51:12,836 --> 00:51:14,836
Happiness finds you.

597
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,739
True?

598
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:19,908
Yes.

599
00:51:23,613 --> 00:51:25,613
I will get it, Om.

600
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,752
I put my hand.

601
00:51:31,955 --> 00:51:33,955
And I will be happy.

602
00:51:38,562 --> 00:51:40,689
And I will be King of the World.

603
00:51:58,648 --> 00:52:00,648
Brother...

604
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:03,952
hey, why he dancing that much?

605
00:52:04,688 --> 00:52:06,688
Cut it!

606
00:52:08,692 --> 00:52:09,593
Om.

607
00:52:09,693 --> 00:52:11,693
And she too.

608
00:52:11,928 --> 00:52:12,829
She is ill sister.

609
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:13,864
Leave it all and take it.

610
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:14,498
I have to go.

611
00:52:14,598 --> 00:52:15,866
Where you go?

612
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:17,991
Your sister-in-law's
shooting at 7th floor.

613
00:52:22,072 --> 00:52:23,740
Beast... bester.

614
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:25,840
Leave me for god sake.

615
00:52:26,109 --> 00:52:29,101
If we leave you for god
then what we do?

616
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:38,653
Fantastic.

617
00:52:39,055 --> 00:52:41,055
Good shot.

618
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:09,386
Leave it man.

619
00:53:09,486 --> 00:53:11,486
They are even like this.

620
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,862
Stop here.

621
00:53:22,666 --> 00:53:24,666
Hello madam.
Come please.

622
00:53:25,435 --> 00:53:27,903
Shanti.
Hey stop where are you going?

623
00:53:28,138 --> 00:53:28,905
She knows me.

624
00:53:29,005 --> 00:53:30,373
There is the make up
room for stars.

625
00:53:30,473 --> 00:53:30,907
I am a star too.

626
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:32,109
Come in.
Oh, boss coming

627
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:34,209
Hello Sir.

628
00:53:50,026 --> 00:53:52,688
He was here now.
Find where he is.

629
00:54:05,475 --> 00:54:07,475
You shut your mouth
for god sake.

630
00:54:07,559 --> 00:54:09,559
Why I shut down?

631
00:54:09,619 --> 00:54:11,619
Because you do yours.

632
00:54:11,715 --> 00:54:13,715
See this magazine Mukesh.

633
00:54:14,117 --> 00:54:16,984
Its right that you marrying with
daughter of Hersh Mithal.

634
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:19,780
And you get Mithal
studio in marraige gift.

635
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:22,954
It will just written and these
gossips will print every day.

636
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,394
Do you know why?

637
00:54:24,494 --> 00:54:27,793
Because we go to make a
biggest movie till now.

638
00:54:28,698 --> 00:54:29,666
Om Shanti Om.

639
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:30,800
I am the producer for it.

640
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:31,701
And you are the heroine.

641
00:54:31,801 --> 00:54:34,736
And Mithal is that man
who helps us in this picture.

642
00:54:35,005 --> 00:54:37,735
She serves his four million
for this movie.

643
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:39,976
Now please stop to
behaving like a child.

644
00:54:40,076 --> 00:54:40,977
And go and shoot.

645
00:54:41,077 --> 00:54:42,646
What comes to stop the
shooting like this?

646
00:54:42,746 --> 00:54:44,746
You think just about
profit every time.

647
00:54:44,914 --> 00:54:46,914
You marrying Mithals daughter
just because this.

648
00:54:47,651 --> 00:54:49,651
But define me that please
Mr. Mehra.

649
00:54:50,754 --> 00:54:52,754
How can you do this marriage?

650
00:54:52,838 --> 00:54:54,838
Because you are
already married.

651
00:54:55,025 --> 00:54:57,025
With me.

652
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:00,096
Shanti, please.

653
00:55:00,196 --> 00:55:02,196
Say quietly if anyone is
listening in?

654
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,935
Why don't you understand?

655
00:55:05,035 --> 00:55:07,035
Why don't you understand
Mahesh?

656
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:10,671
Its two years ago of our marriage but I
can't take your hand in public.

657
00:55:11,274 --> 00:55:17,975
But for me its really important
between four million of Mithal.

658
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:25,118
I tell you about it which day you
go outside with this.

659
00:55:25,955 --> 00:55:27,955
Then Om Shanti Om will end.

660
00:55:28,191 --> 00:55:33,185
Because no one will give me just a
cent for married heroine's picture.

661
00:55:33,797 --> 00:55:35,797
Your faith will end everything Shanti.

662
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:38,935
Not only your career

663
00:55:39,035 --> 00:55:41,035
mine too.

664
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:44,672
You are my career Mukesh.

665
00:55:44,874 --> 00:55:46,874
I am your wife.

666
00:55:47,243 --> 00:55:49,243
You have to respect
me between all of them.

667
00:55:50,046 --> 00:55:52,046
And I have the rights for this.

668
00:55:54,617 --> 00:55:56,710
And I want my right today.

669
00:55:59,122 --> 00:56:00,824
Do this to deserve me happy.

670
00:56:00,924 --> 00:56:02,924
What is this nonsense, Shanti.

671
00:56:03,008 --> 00:56:04,694
You have to do Om Shanti Om.

672
00:56:04,794 --> 00:56:06,596
This movie will begin once.

673
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:08,696
Then, after few months we
tell everyone this.

674
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:11,599
Everyone will know in few months.

675
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:16,070
What do you mean?

676
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:19,207
I mean that I am pregnant.

677
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:23,010
And you have to be father, Mukesh.

678
00:56:28,918 --> 00:56:30,918
What?

679
00:56:31,354 --> 00:56:33,354
You are pregnant?

680
00:56:37,127 --> 00:56:38,561
Fantastic.

681
00:56:38,661 --> 00:56:39,796
Why didn't you tell me before.

682
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:42,260
Its true.

683
00:58:41,951 --> 00:58:43,951
Shanti you done true.

684
00:58:46,155 --> 00:58:48,155
You choose your happiness.

685
00:58:48,324 --> 00:58:51,760
But don't think that my heart is broken.

686
00:58:52,495 --> 00:58:54,495
No...

687
00:58:54,797 --> 00:58:56,065
I am happy.

688
00:58:56,165 --> 00:58:57,300
I am happy.

689
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,102
Because.

690
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:01,202
You are happy.

691
00:59:03,773 --> 00:59:05,341
But.

692
00:59:05,441 --> 00:59:08,740
Tell to Mr. Mehra I leave him this time.

693
00:59:09,445 --> 00:59:11,445
Just for you.

694
00:59:13,182 --> 00:59:22,921
If I get him in next life then I will...
mind it.

695
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:31,899
Are you bored yet?

696
00:59:32,969 --> 00:59:34,969
Thanks.

697
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,658
Mukesh.

698
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:05,862
Where you bring me?

699
01:01:05,962 --> 01:01:07,497
I don't want to see any set.

700
01:01:07,597 --> 01:01:09,399
To show you our Shanti's set.

701
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:11,499
Is it true?

702
01:01:19,642 --> 01:01:21,642
Its beautiful Mukesh.

703
01:01:22,211 --> 01:01:25,908
Come on.
This is the set of Om Shanti Om.

704
01:01:26,315 --> 01:01:29,443
The most biggest set of the
most biggest movie of India.

705
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:32,446
But now there is
nothing any shooting.

706
01:01:33,089 --> 01:01:36,354
Infect it will be break
down in some days.

707
01:01:36,926 --> 01:01:40,384
Because I was do
this film to you.

708
01:01:41,564 --> 01:01:44,499
But no one can take
your place Shanti.

709
01:01:45,168 --> 01:01:47,659
And there is a big party
before it down.

710
01:01:50,139 --> 01:01:52,139
For our marriage.

711
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:54,477
Is it true Mukesh?

712
01:01:54,577 --> 01:01:56,145
Of course, of course.
My heart.

713
01:01:56,245 --> 01:01:59,180
Our guests are comes
from here.

714
01:01:59,649 --> 01:02:03,244
And here is a 40 pieces orchestra
plays your favorite songs.

715
01:02:03,453 --> 01:02:08,481
And here is a big fountain which
falls champagne, not water.

716
01:02:08,991 --> 01:02:11,619
And here in the shadow of
this beautiful lighting.

717
01:02:12,095 --> 01:02:16,657
Is the place of our marriage
where we take our seven rounds.

718
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:18,568
Before everyone.

719
01:02:18,668 --> 01:02:20,668
I can't believe it.

720
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:30,944
Mukesh wasn't think that you
can love me that much.

721
01:02:31,314 --> 01:02:33,314
I am sorry for not believing in you.

722
01:02:33,516 --> 01:02:38,579
No, I am sorry for you not
trusting me.

723
01:02:39,522 --> 01:02:41,522
If you can't do this then how
can I see the dreams?

724
01:02:43,459 --> 01:02:46,986
But I have seen to be a biggest
man of this industry.

725
01:02:48,064 --> 01:02:51,056
But now that dream
comes bigger like this.

726
01:02:51,567 --> 01:02:53,615
Will break your trust.
But not this dream.

727
01:02:53,715 --> 01:02:56,103
You are hurting me Mukesh.
No, you are hurting me.

728
01:02:56,506 --> 01:02:59,168
Do you think this.
No, always not.

729
01:03:00,743 --> 01:03:02,973
Why you do all this?

730
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:04,614
Everything was going perfect.

731
01:03:04,714 --> 01:03:06,349
We have Mithal's money also.

732
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:09,077
You were going to be the
biggest heroine of India.

733
01:03:09,385 --> 01:03:11,385
And I would be the biggest producer.

734
01:03:11,587 --> 01:03:15,990
No, because its just you.
now listen to me.

735
01:03:16,425 --> 01:03:20,191
I can't marry you and nor
I can return Mithal's money.

736
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:23,993
But here is only one way.

737
01:03:26,602 --> 01:03:28,602
Just because of you
I have to crush whole set.

738
01:03:29,372 --> 01:03:31,372
I am sorry.
What a shit?

739
01:03:31,456 --> 01:03:33,456
I have decided to burn it.

740
01:03:34,043 --> 01:03:37,240
But it can't burn alone.

741
01:03:38,447 --> 01:03:41,245
Here the cause burns with it.

742
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:46,120
You.

743
01:03:46,455 --> 01:03:48,091
I am sorry, Shanti.

744
01:03:48,191 --> 01:03:50,191
But.

745
01:03:51,127 --> 01:03:53,127
I think its off.

746
01:03:57,733 --> 01:04:00,497
No... Mukesh.

747
01:04:06,175 --> 01:04:08,175
No...

748
01:04:12,648 --> 01:04:14,809
no... Mukesh.

749
01:04:16,586 --> 01:04:18,586
Mukesh.

750
01:04:23,092 --> 01:04:25,092
Mukesh...

751
01:04:49,585 --> 01:04:51,585
open it.

752
01:04:54,423 --> 01:04:56,423
Please open.

753
01:04:58,628 --> 01:05:00,628
Please, no, no.

754
01:05:00,830 --> 01:05:02,830
Mukesh.

755
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:25,753
Shanti.

756
01:05:30,393 --> 01:05:32,393
Om, let me out.

757
01:05:38,634 --> 01:05:40,634
Check she can't go outside.

758
01:07:40,456 --> 01:07:41,857
Shanti...

759
01:07:41,957 --> 01:07:46,792
Om... Om...

760
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:52,733
Om...

761
01:07:53,502 --> 01:07:55,502
Shanti...

762
01:07:57,406 --> 01:07:59,406
Om...

763
01:11:01,757 --> 01:11:03,757
congratulations, Mr. Kapoor.
It's a boy.

764
01:11:22,945 --> 01:11:24,446
What happened doctor?

765
01:11:24,546 --> 01:11:26,546
Mr. Kapoor, I am afraid.

766
01:11:26,622 --> 01:11:28,017
Its bad news.

767
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:30,117
That man which
comes with you.

768
01:11:30,201 --> 01:11:32,201
We can't save him.

769
01:11:33,255 --> 01:11:35,255
Oh, my god.

770
01:11:36,925 --> 01:11:38,925
What happens now, Nasir.

771
01:11:39,001 --> 01:11:40,563
Don't worry, Sir.

772
01:11:40,663 --> 01:11:41,964
It was an accident.

773
01:11:42,064 --> 01:11:44,089
Doctor says that he
was almost dead.

774
01:11:45,234 --> 01:11:47,234
But Nasir, what about his family?

775
01:11:48,937 --> 01:11:51,804
I am your secretary
Sir, I can handle it all.

776
01:12:18,533 --> 01:12:21,900
Today is birthday of Om Kapoor,
son of Rajesh Kapoor.

777
01:12:22,337 --> 01:12:24,430
And his all fans are here to wish him

778
01:12:25,407 --> 01:12:27,407
Happy Birthday.

779
01:12:28,376 --> 01:12:31,311
I would have wonderful bedroom,
like in Yash Chopra's set

780
01:12:31,913 --> 01:12:33,415
with rounded bed,

781
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:39,215
and when I'll wakeup in the morning,
than before my feet touch to the floor,

782
01:12:39,587 --> 01:12:43,318
one servant will bring velvet sleepers
into my feet

783
01:12:44,592 --> 01:12:46,651
when I'll go outside, wearing
Raj Kumar's silk gown

784
01:12:49,497 --> 01:12:53,092
the other servant will
give me a glass of juice,

785
01:13:36,978 --> 01:13:39,967
superstar Om Kapoor, whose nick is ok,
has come to his balcony,

786
01:13:41,316 --> 01:13:42,584
hi Dad!

787
01:13:42,684 --> 01:13:44,684
Happy Birthday

788
01:13:59,467 --> 01:14:01,662
here comes superstar, Om Kapoor.

789
01:14:07,108 --> 01:14:10,699
He's just four hours late,

790
01:14:21,556 --> 01:14:23,556
Sir, autograph,

791
01:14:25,393 --> 01:14:27,393
he's quite short in his real life,

792
01:14:34,769 --> 01:14:37,237
Dad, it's 4 o'clock,
when will hero arrive?

793
01:14:38,807 --> 01:14:40,807
Looks like I'll have an attack,

794
01:14:46,181 --> 01:14:46,981
ready Sir,
are you director?

795
01:14:47,081 --> 01:14:47,649
Yes Sir,
tell me the scene!

796
01:14:47,749 --> 01:14:49,017
come on tell me the scene!

797
01:14:49,117 --> 01:14:51,117
As you see it's a climax scene Sir,

798
01:14:51,193 --> 01:14:54,088
and in this our actress
Natasha is going to...

799
01:14:54,622 --> 01:14:56,622
marry our villain, Ranbheer

800
01:14:57,225 --> 01:14:59,225
that's so rocks babe,

801
01:14:59,594 --> 01:15:00,962
rocks?
Nokia, bluetooth,

802
01:15:01,062 --> 01:15:03,223
you keep talking and I'll keep talking,

803
01:15:03,698 --> 01:15:09,034
Sir, Raj means your heart is breaking!

804
01:15:09,370 --> 01:15:10,605
He wants to say to actress, but he can't

805
01:15:10,705 --> 01:15:11,740
why?
Am I mute?

806
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:12,707
Correct Sir,

807
01:15:12,807 --> 01:15:14,042
you remember your mother's death scene!

808
01:15:14,142 --> 01:15:15,210
So there's also a mother
in this scene!

809
01:15:15,310 --> 01:15:18,108
Yes in mother's death scene you shouted
this much,

810
01:15:18,379 --> 01:15:20,148
that your voice is gone forever.

811
01:15:20,248 --> 01:15:23,615
At this point, for the last time,
you want to see Natasha,

812
01:15:24,085 --> 01:15:25,320
but you can't see her,
why? Why?

813
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:27,021
Because you are blind too,

814
01:15:27,121 --> 01:15:28,289
so I'm a blind too,
I see.

815
01:15:28,389 --> 01:15:29,157
No Sir, you don't

816
01:15:29,257 --> 01:15:30,191
I don't?

817
01:15:30,291 --> 01:15:32,291
Background music begins, and
your walk away from marriage spot starts,

818
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:34,560
and Natasha turn around and sees you,

819
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:36,364
Natasha sees me,

820
01:15:36,464 --> 01:15:37,999
but Natasha was blind...
no Sir, blind is you,

821
01:15:38,099 --> 01:15:39,300
no, but I was mute.

822
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:40,668
Sir, you are mute,

823
01:15:40,768 --> 01:15:42,768
and also blind, and when Natasha says you...

824
01:15:43,104 --> 01:15:44,372
please stop Raj,

825
01:15:44,472 --> 01:15:46,472
but you won't stop,
because you are deaf too.

826
01:15:50,411 --> 01:15:53,642
In background Natasha's marriage,
and in foreground you and your heart voice.

827
01:15:54,515 --> 01:15:56,251
Ok, I'm angry now,

828
01:15:56,351 --> 01:15:58,512
voice, one second...
let me hear dialogues,

829
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:03,416
Natasha, I want to say, that I want
to take you away from the spot,

830
01:16:03,892 --> 01:16:06,520
but I'm cursed, I can not
stand up from the wheel chair,

831
01:16:06,828 --> 01:16:08,828
and my both hands are cut off.

832
01:16:09,297 --> 01:16:11,132
Wow, my both hands are cut off.

833
01:16:11,232 --> 01:16:12,333
What the hell is this.

834
01:16:12,433 --> 01:16:16,529
In this film, is there any body part of
hero is in working order or not?

835
01:16:17,305 --> 01:16:19,305
Of course, as you see, his painful heart.

836
01:16:19,641 --> 01:16:21,641
Won't pain in heart but will definitely
pain in head, watching to this movie,

837
01:16:21,876 --> 01:16:23,478
this film will get critical acclaim,

838
01:16:23,578 --> 01:16:25,578
and also awards,

839
01:16:25,662 --> 01:16:27,215
but tell you what,
this film is a flop!

840
01:16:27,315 --> 01:16:28,817
This film is gone,
you are dead old man.

841
01:16:28,917 --> 01:16:30,084
You are dead!

842
01:16:30,184 --> 01:16:32,184
Unless,

843
01:16:32,553 --> 01:16:34,553
unless, I think of something as usual!

844
01:16:34,923 --> 01:16:41,158
In this situation, there must be an item
song to express the pain.

845
01:16:43,197 --> 01:16:45,197
There must be something painful Qawali,

846
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:46,167
but I have done it...

847
01:16:46,267 --> 01:16:47,535
painful rock... no, no...

848
01:16:47,635 --> 01:16:52,538
I think it should be like painful...
disco!

849
01:16:53,207 --> 01:16:54,075
Disco!

850
01:16:54,175 --> 01:16:55,743
But Sir the one have no hand, eyes and ear,

851
01:16:55,843 --> 01:16:57,312
how can he do disco.

852
01:16:57,412 --> 01:16:58,780
Idiot! Dream sequence,

853
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:00,148
ok can do anything!

854
01:17:00,248 --> 01:17:02,248
come on girls,

855
01:17:03,418 --> 01:17:05,153
and listen, the actress is quite bad!

856
01:17:05,253 --> 01:17:06,454
Is she your girlfriend?

857
01:17:06,554 --> 01:17:08,122
No Sir, she's of him,

858
01:17:08,222 --> 01:17:09,190
papa! You must change her!

859
01:17:09,290 --> 01:17:11,383
Bring up 4 or 5 item girls, besides her,

860
01:17:11,893 --> 01:17:14,453
I'm telling you, your film
will be a hit because of this song.

861
01:17:14,729 --> 01:17:15,563
come on!

862
01:17:15,663 --> 01:17:17,131
Cheer up!

863
01:17:17,231 --> 01:17:19,231
And pack up!

864
01:21:41,963 --> 01:21:43,963
Cut the scene!

865
01:21:50,104 --> 01:21:50,972
Who brought up the fire!

866
01:21:51,072 --> 01:21:52,874
Don't you know he is afraid of fire,

867
01:21:52,974 --> 01:21:54,509
afraid of fire, I didn't know!

868
01:21:54,609 --> 01:21:56,609
Take me home.
Take me home!

869
01:21:58,079 --> 01:22:00,079
Pack up!

870
01:22:02,917 --> 01:22:04,917
Please everyone, I'm ok!

871
01:22:07,221 --> 01:22:07,855
My son!

872
01:22:07,955 --> 01:22:09,157
Om my son!

873
01:22:09,257 --> 01:22:11,452
Where you gone!

874
01:22:12,026 --> 01:22:14,688
You know, how long I've
been waiting for you!

875
01:22:15,029 --> 01:22:16,531
Manwar!

876
01:22:16,631 --> 01:22:17,565
Hey, security guys!

877
01:22:17,665 --> 01:22:18,900
When are you coming back home!
Son!

878
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Tell me,
listen to me, Om!

879
01:22:21,076 --> 01:22:22,803
Om!
Om!

880
01:22:22,903 --> 01:22:23,905
Leave me!

881
01:22:24,005 --> 01:22:26,005
Leave me!

882
01:22:27,875 --> 01:22:29,610
Who is that old woman?

883
01:22:29,710 --> 01:22:30,945
She is at every studio!

884
01:22:31,045 --> 01:22:32,180
I feel something looking at her!

885
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:33,447
She's is mad,

886
01:22:33,547 --> 01:22:35,183
She thinks that you
are her son!

887
01:22:35,283 --> 01:22:37,283
Dude, I'm a star, and all woman
in India thinks of me as their son

888
01:22:37,652 --> 01:22:38,519
that's good, but this is not!

889
01:22:38,619 --> 01:22:39,654
Make sure it won't happen again!

890
01:22:39,754 --> 01:22:41,556
You could get hurt!

891
01:22:41,656 --> 01:22:43,656
Move it, damn!

892
01:22:54,302 --> 01:22:57,567
Pappu, he left me again,
please stop him.

893
01:22:58,806 --> 01:23:00,208
Why you trouble yourself?

894
01:23:00,308 --> 01:23:01,509
That's not our Om!

895
01:23:01,609 --> 01:23:02,443
He's Om Kapoor!

896
01:23:02,543 --> 01:23:04,011
Only his face resembles to our Om!

897
01:23:04,111 --> 01:23:06,111
No Pappu, he's my Om.

898
01:23:06,204 --> 01:23:07,848
My son Om!

899
01:23:07,948 --> 01:23:10,178
Hello, this is my son Om!

900
01:23:11,819 --> 01:23:13,819
Sure and yes Amitabh
Bachan is my father,

901
01:23:18,192 --> 01:23:20,192
there are many reasons of blackouts
and headache

902
01:23:20,795 --> 01:23:22,795
but he don't have any of them,

903
01:23:23,998 --> 01:23:26,967
cancel all the dates of that,
fool producer and his son

904
01:23:28,169 --> 01:23:30,169
and give all the dates to our
superhero film!

905
01:23:30,253 --> 01:23:31,639
Superheroes are in!

906
01:23:31,739 --> 01:23:34,902
I will give them date, but how can
they create set in one day!

907
01:23:35,242 --> 01:23:36,644
Shut up!

908
01:23:36,744 --> 01:23:38,871
If there is no set than,
we can shoot in real location,

909
01:23:39,347 --> 01:23:41,347
everything is ok with ok.
Ok!

910
01:23:42,016 --> 01:23:44,016
And please shove this up your nose!

911
01:23:44,318 --> 01:23:45,820
Shove it up your nose!

912
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:47,121
Shove it up your nose

913
01:23:47,221 --> 01:23:49,221
come on!

914
01:23:53,127 --> 01:23:53,828
Come on,

915
01:23:53,928 --> 01:23:54,729
shove it up your nose!

916
01:23:54,829 --> 01:23:56,829
Come on!

917
01:23:56,997 --> 01:23:58,499
Go on!

918
01:23:58,599 --> 01:24:00,599
No sneeze ok!

919
01:24:00,683 --> 01:24:02,683
After this you going to try other holes!

920
01:24:03,771 --> 01:24:04,772
I've been driving for an hour!

921
01:24:04,872 --> 01:24:06,140
Where is this goddamn place?

922
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:07,575
Can't you set near home?

923
01:24:07,675 --> 01:24:09,010
We were going to setup near home,

924
01:24:09,110 --> 01:24:11,110
but you said, that make it real location!

925
01:24:11,245 --> 01:24:13,014
In such less time, this
location is ready!

926
01:24:13,114 --> 01:24:14,248
What's good in this location,

927
01:24:14,348 --> 01:24:16,348
except being in China!

928
01:24:17,785 --> 01:24:19,785
This is studio is completely burned!

929
01:24:21,055 --> 01:24:23,055
Then why are we going there!

930
01:24:23,224 --> 01:24:25,590
It's quite perfect according to
the look what director wants

931
01:24:25,926 --> 01:24:27,161
he wanted ruins!

932
01:24:27,261 --> 01:24:29,261
No such place, worse than this!

933
01:24:29,397 --> 01:24:31,032
What?

934
01:24:31,132 --> 01:24:34,192
I've hared that 30 years ago,
there was a great incident.

935
01:24:34,835 --> 01:24:37,633
It was a big set, but fire took place,
before shooting begin.

936
01:24:38,005 --> 01:24:39,106
And whole things burned up!

937
01:24:39,206 --> 01:24:41,606
The picture was banned, in
which this set was chosen

938
01:24:42,243 --> 01:24:44,677
but along with, the whole studio
got wasted!

939
01:24:45,413 --> 01:24:46,814
It's a very unlucky place!

940
01:24:46,914 --> 01:24:47,915
What a wonderful location!

941
01:24:48,015 --> 01:24:49,684
It's unlucky!
Set got burned!

942
01:24:49,784 --> 01:24:50,785
Studio got wasted,

943
01:24:50,885 --> 01:24:52,019
film got banned!

944
01:24:52,119 --> 01:24:53,621
Well done, Anwar!

945
01:24:53,721 --> 01:24:55,721
Well done, you idiot!

946
01:25:23,184 --> 01:25:25,948
Anwar, did we come here before?

947
01:25:26,787 --> 01:25:27,688
No way!

948
01:25:27,788 --> 01:25:29,788
No one comes here!

949
01:25:29,881 --> 01:25:31,881
It's the first time shooting
here in 30 years!

950
01:25:38,098 --> 01:25:40,098
Two months bill remaining,
who'll clear it, your father!

951
01:25:44,438 --> 01:25:46,207
Star!

952
01:25:46,307 --> 01:25:48,307
Face!

953
01:25:50,211 --> 01:25:52,211
How can I be star
with this name!

954
01:25:56,817 --> 01:25:58,817
Hey, where are you going,

955
01:25:59,286 --> 01:26:01,286
afterwards, it's stars' makeup room

956
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:06,994
welcome Sir!

957
01:26:07,094 --> 01:26:09,094
Dude, what a location,
check it out!

958
01:26:09,396 --> 01:26:11,396
This wild old world place!

959
01:26:13,033 --> 01:26:15,033
Anwar! Come with me I'll
show you makeup room

960
01:26:16,770 --> 01:26:18,770
It's in this building, on second floor!

961
01:26:18,854 --> 01:26:20,007
Right!

962
01:26:20,107 --> 01:26:21,976
How do you know?

963
01:26:22,076 --> 01:26:22,910
come on let go,
show us rooms

964
01:26:23,010 --> 01:26:25,010
come on!

965
01:26:58,279 --> 01:27:00,279
Who! Creepy dude!

966
01:27:00,915 --> 01:27:01,749
Sir, shot is not here!

967
01:27:01,849 --> 01:27:03,849
It's going back there!

968
01:27:04,485 --> 01:27:06,485
Yeah, yeah!

969
01:27:15,162 --> 01:27:17,162
God! I'm so hot

970
01:27:18,198 --> 01:27:19,333
babes, what kind of costume is this!

971
01:27:19,433 --> 01:27:21,433
Seems like torturing me,

972
01:27:24,838 --> 01:27:27,068
and what's the reason of wearing
this underwear over the costume!

973
01:27:27,374 --> 01:27:28,108
Dude you are a superhero,

974
01:27:28,208 --> 01:27:29,210
rescuer of love,

975
01:27:29,310 --> 01:27:31,310
Mohabbat Man!

976
01:27:32,846 --> 01:27:34,181
I feel more like a moron man!

977
01:27:34,281 --> 01:27:36,340
Spiderman & superman used to wear
same underwear!

978
01:27:38,886 --> 01:27:41,252
You have double role!

979
01:27:41,922 --> 01:27:45,153
We can recognize real superhero,
by this underwear!

980
01:27:46,093 --> 01:27:47,228
Dude that's a good idea!

981
01:27:47,328 --> 01:27:48,929
This is my last shot,

982
01:27:49,029 --> 01:27:51,029
because you know I don't' do retakes

983
01:27:51,231 --> 01:27:54,462
because when ok gives take,
than it must be ok!

984
01:27:56,270 --> 01:27:58,270
Action!

985
01:28:00,407 --> 01:28:02,407
Mohabbat Man, save me!

986
01:28:02,910 --> 01:28:04,411
Mohabbat Man! To the rescue

987
01:28:04,511 --> 01:28:06,511

1009
01:32:33,714 --> 01:32:34,648

01:32:48,629 --> 01:32:52,690
I'm here to protest against
removing this slum!

1017
01:32:53,267 --> 01:32:54,768
Om Kapoor! Who is this?

1018
01:32:54,868 --> 01:32:56,868
Chunkey Pandey going to win

1019
01:32:57,571 --> 01:32:58,338

01:33:09,416 --> 01:33:11,416
Of course it'll be of my son
Hrithik Roshan!

1023
01:33:12,419 --> 01:33:15,149
I think, it'll have to be me!

1024
01:33:15,923 --> 01:33:19,120
Om and me... can't talk in camera

1025
01:33:19,326 --> 01:33:20,627
we are just good friends!

1026
01:33:20,727 --> 01:33:23,321
Om Kapoor and me, what should I say?

1027
01:33:23,764 --> 01:33:25,132
We are just good friends

1028
01:33:25,232 --> 01:33:27,427
Om Kapoor and me,
are just good friends!

1029
01:33:27,901 --> 01:33:30,461
Om Kapoor and me,
we are just good friends!

1030
01:33:30,938 --> 01:33:32,938
I think it should get to Om Kapoor!

1031
01:33:33,206 --> 01:33:34,741
Om Kapoor who?

1032
01:33:34,841 --> 01:33:36,841

This time he's not with a babe!

1038
01:33:59,399 --> 01:34:06,362
This time he's not going to lose!

this is cheating!

1060
01:37:15,529 --> 01:37:17,529
This award is fraud!

1061
01:37:25,672 --> 01:37:26,673
I will have award?

1062

01:38:04,711 --> 01:38:10,172
I just want to say!

1066
01:38:14,754 --> 01:38:19,054
I tried hard to achieve you,

1067
01:38:20,727 --> 01:38:25,528
everything propagates
to make me meet you!

1068
01:38:27,234 --> 01:38:34,504
It's said if you want something desperately
whole world tries to have you achieve that,

1069
01:38:36,076 --> 01:38:39,512
today you all made me meet to what I want,

1070
01:38:40,647 --> 01:38:42,015
thank you!

1071
01:38:42,115 --> 01:38:43,984
Thank you very much!

1072
01:38:44,084 --> 01:38:46,084
I'm thankful to you all,

1073
01:38:46,553 --> 01:38:49,044

1074
01:38:49,889 --> 01:38:52,824

1075
01:38:55,762 --> 01:38:59,698

1076
01:39:01,501 --> 01:39:03,799
that like our film in our real lives,

1077
01:39:05,005 --> 01:39:08,839
everything get better in the end,

1078
01:39:09,609 --> 01:39:11,609
you know,
happy endings!

1079
01:39:14,547 --> 01:39:18,176
And if things not get better,

1080
01:39:20,687 --> 01:39:22,687
than that's not the end!

1081
01:39:24,791 --> 01:39:27,817
It means film is still remaining!

1082
01:39:42,742 --> 01:39:44,742

01:39:48,148 --> 01:39:51,242

Are you ok?

1085
01:39:57,157 --> 01:39:58,625
Dad! I don't know!

1086
01:39:58,725 --> 01:40:00,725
I was thinking...

1087
01:40:00,860 --> 01:40:02,860
what if I wasn't you son,

1088
01:40:03,029 --> 01:40:04,130
I wasn't Om Kapoor,

1089
01:40:04,230 --> 01:40:06,630
I was some ordinary Om,

1090
01:40:07,067 --> 01:40:09,865
I could never get all this!

1091
01:40:10,770 --> 01:40:18,302
This stardom, name, and there must be some
bottle beside award in my hand, and drunk!

1092
01:40:21,281 --> 01:40:23,281
I want to promise you today, Dad

1093
01:40:23,583 --> 01:40:25,583
I'll work hard,

1094
01:40:26,319 --> 01:40:29,220
and I'll try being a better actor,

1095
01:40:30,090 --> 01:40:33,719
and if not that, at least
I'll try being a better son

1096
01:40:35,929 --> 01:40:36,696
yeah!

1097
01:40:36,796 --> 01:40:39,959

01:51:41,560 --> 01:51:43,560
You've taken much time!

1121
01:51:43,996 --> 01:51:45,996
I was afraid!

1122
01:51:47,033 --> 01:51:49,033
Very filmy!

1123
01:51:50,436 --> 01:51:52,436
What's to worry about

1124
01:51:56,008 --> 01:51:58,008

Than why you left me alone!

1128
01:52:10,356 --> 01:52:12,722
Please just forgive me today!

1129
01:52:16,762 --> 01:52:20,596
I couldn't recognize you!

1130
01:52:24,937 --> 01:52:26,937
But you recognized me,

1131
01:52:27,673 --> 01:52:30,904
really, only mom can have such heart!

1132
01:52:34,046 --> 01:52:36,046
My son, my hero!

1133
01:52:37,817 --> 01:52:39,817
My Omii!

1134
01:52:47,693 --> 01:52:49,693
Omi!

1135
01:53:04,944 --> 01:53:06,579
You've become old,

1136
01:53:06,679 --> 01:53:08,679

1137
01:53:09,482 --> 01:53:12,883

1140
01:53:24,864 --> 01:53:25,865

Really!

1148
01:53:51,157 --> 01:53:53,157
No one agrees to this story!

1149
01:53:54,627 --> 01:53:57,619
Sometimes, truth is different from stories!

1150
01:53:58,664 --> 01:54:00,664
We can't prove anything to anyone!

1151
01:54:00,833 --> 01:54:02,833
That scoundrel will be saved once again,

1152
01:54:02,917 --> 01:54:04,917
we didn't find Shanti's corpse there Om!

1153
01:54:05,804 --> 01:54:07,804
We couldn't find about you too!

1154
01:54:09,408 --> 01:54:11,408
If you want anything with all your heart,

1155
01:54:11,744 --> 01:54:16,511
the whole world begins effort
to make you meet to that,

1156
01:54:20,419 --> 01:54:22,419
that's what we used to say!

1157
01:54:22,888 --> 01:54:24,888
That Mukesh Mehra is thinking that...

1158
01:54:25,424 --> 01:54:26,826
he is totally saved,

1159
01:54:26,926 --> 01:54:28,926
there's no witness, nor evidence, but...

1160
01:54:29,428 --> 01:54:31,555
that's the game of nature,

1161
01:54:33,499 --> 01:54:35,499
that god brought him
once again to me,

1162
01:54:36,669 --> 01:54:37,970
my visit to that studio,

1163
01:54:38,070 --> 01:54:39,071
my recognition of myself,

1164
01:54:39,171 --> 01:54:40,039
my meeting with Mom,

1165
01:54:40,139 --> 01:54:42,139
meeting to you, it's not a coincidence,

1166
01:54:42,223 --> 01:54:43,909
it's not coincidence,

1167
01:54:44,009 --> 01:54:45,744
no... no!

1168
01:54:45,844 --> 01:54:49,109
Someone else is writing this story!

1169
01:54:50,549 --> 01:54:54,041
And this time, ending of this story,

1170
01:54:55,854 --> 01:54:59,449
is in our hands,

1171
01:55:01,694 --> 01:55:03,694
I can not forget, Shanti's screams,

1172
01:55:05,631 --> 01:55:07,631
I couldn't save her at that time,

1173
01:55:07,800 --> 01:55:08,901
because I was bound,

1174
01:55:09,001 --> 01:55:10,503
I was nothing,

1175
01:55:10,603 --> 01:55:12,071
but this time the tables have turned!

1176
01:55:12,171 --> 01:55:14,605
And Mukesh Mehra must be punished!

1177
01:55:15,808 --> 01:55:18,003
This time, it'll be justice with Shanti!

1178
01:55:19,011 --> 01:55:19,879
She'll have justice,

1179
01:55:19,979 --> 01:55:22,504
and this time, everything will be fine,

1180
01:55:23,983 --> 01:55:27,111
because, the picture is still remaining!

1181
01:55:28,887 --> 01:55:30,887
Still remaining, my friend!

1182
01:55:33,058 --> 01:55:35,058
You want to remake the film
"Om Shanti Om"

1183
01:55:35,194 --> 01:55:36,162
that's ridiculous,

1184
01:55:36,262 --> 01:55:37,096
I'm serious Mukesh!

1185
01:55:37,196 --> 01:55:38,864
You know Mukesh,

1186
01:55:38,964 --> 01:55:42,229
I have been offered four to
five scripts daily, I reject them all,

1187
01:55:44,536 --> 01:55:46,561
but Om Shanti Om, that's cool,

1188
01:55:47,072 --> 01:55:49,870
it has emotion, drama, action, romance,

1189
01:55:50,175 --> 01:55:52,175
I'm sure it's going to be a
block buster Mukesh!

1190
01:55:52,259 --> 01:55:57,547
Rebirth, who believe
in this shit nowadays?

1191
01:55:59,118 --> 01:56:01,118
That doesn't matter,
if anyone believes or not,

1192
01:56:01,754 --> 01:56:03,754
you just have to believe

1193
01:56:06,091 --> 01:56:07,526
as a maker,

1194
01:56:07,626 --> 01:56:09,626
you have to in the script Mukesh!

1195
01:56:10,829 --> 01:56:12,064
Call me Mike,

1196
01:56:12,164 --> 01:56:14,164
everyone in Hollywood does,

1197
01:56:14,266 --> 01:56:16,266
Mukesh became Mike,
that's funny, Mike!

1198
01:56:17,536 --> 01:56:19,561
And that film's
climax was not written, Om!

1199
01:56:21,774 --> 01:56:22,942
That project was a bloody jinx!

1200
01:56:23,042 --> 01:56:24,677
Bloody curse!

1201
01:56:24,777 --> 01:56:25,611
What curse!

1202
01:56:25,711 --> 01:56:28,077
Cursing was just for
that insurance company

1203
01:56:28,647 --> 01:56:31,707
who has given you four times
value of studio when it got burned!

1204
01:56:32,017 --> 01:56:37,148
And you got married to...
Harsh Mithal's daughter,

1205
01:56:38,090 --> 01:56:39,225
you went to Hollywood,

1206
01:56:39,325 --> 01:56:40,993
millions of dollars you have,

1207
01:56:41,093 --> 01:56:42,094
you haven't taken one shot,

1208
01:56:42,194 --> 01:56:44,958
and Om Shanti Om became
the biggest movie of your career,

1209
01:56:45,631 --> 01:56:48,794
where is the bloody curse Mike?

1210
01:56:51,570 --> 01:56:54,130
You know much about me, Om!

1211
01:56:54,740 --> 01:56:55,774
No!

1212
01:56:55,874 --> 01:56:57,209
Call me O.K.!

1213
01:56:57,309 --> 01:56:59,309
Everyone in Bollywood does,

1214
01:57:00,012 --> 01:57:02,012
got you! Yeah!

1215
01:57:02,181 --> 01:57:03,983
And I also know that,

1216
01:57:04,083 --> 01:57:06,551
there was an incident at your set,
to your actress, what's her name?

1217
01:57:07,152 --> 01:57:09,152
Sha...
Shanti!

1218
01:57:10,055 --> 01:57:11,857
Shanti what?

1219
01:57:11,957 --> 01:57:13,957
Shanti Priya
Shanti Priya!

1220
01:57:14,041 --> 01:57:15,160
What happened?

1221
01:57:15,260 --> 01:57:17,260
What become of Shanti Priya!

1222
01:57:19,064 --> 01:57:21,064
She...

1223
01:57:21,148 --> 01:57:23,148
she disappeared!

1224
01:57:24,903 --> 01:57:26,903
I tried much to find her,

1225
01:57:27,005 --> 01:57:28,807
but gone!

1226
01:57:28,907 --> 01:57:30,907
Gone

1227
01:57:32,845 --> 01:57:35,746
they say, you can
find God if you search

1228
01:57:37,249 --> 01:57:41,310
It looks like you didn't
intent to find her, Mike!

1229
01:57:46,892 --> 01:57:49,311
It's a joke, chill dude!

1230
01:57:49,411 --> 01:57:51,411
Hey, get away!

1231
01:57:54,700 --> 01:57:55,801
Are you ok?

1232
01:57:55,901 --> 01:57:57,770
I'm not ok!

1233
01:57:57,870 --> 01:57:59,870
No, I'm not ok!

1234
01:58:00,339 --> 01:58:02,933
I'm scared of fire!
Really!

1235
01:58:04,643 --> 01:58:06,838
I'm scared of fire, Mike!

1236
01:58:12,151 --> 01:58:15,951
Seriously speaking, if you want
to do any work with me,

1237
01:58:16,221 --> 01:58:19,054
It must be Om Shanti Om, otherwise
I'm not interested Mike!

1238
01:58:23,228 --> 01:58:25,228
You know, you are very stubborn!

1239
01:58:25,397 --> 01:58:27,397
I know that!

1240
01:58:27,933 --> 01:58:29,933
I like that!

1241
01:58:30,068 --> 01:58:32,068
I'm going to America for a month,
as I come back and you...

1242
01:58:32,371 --> 01:58:35,738
and you'll find your actress,

1243
01:58:37,075 --> 01:58:39,669
we'll shoot!

1244
01:58:43,015 --> 01:58:44,116
You got it!

1245
01:58:44,216 --> 01:58:45,984
You got it! Mike!

1246
01:58:46,084 --> 01:58:47,052
And...

1247
01:58:47,152 --> 01:58:49,152
don't worry about
the climax, Mikey!

1248
01:58:50,255 --> 01:58:53,053
I'll write this story's climax myself,
this time!

1249
01:58:54,226 --> 01:58:55,260
Cheers! To a new beginning!

1250
01:58:55,360 --> 01:58:58,193
No, no... to a new end!
Mike!

1251
01:59:09,875 --> 01:59:12,207
One "chutki sindur", take five.

1252
01:59:13,345 --> 01:59:16,712
What you know about the value of
one "chutki sindur" Ramesh.

1253
01:59:16,982 --> 01:59:20,440
What you know about the value of
one "chutki sindur" Ramesh.

1254
01:59:20,986 --> 01:59:25,082
What you know about the value of
one "chutki sindur" Ramesh.

1255
01:59:26,024 --> 01:59:27,760
What you know "yogesh"?

1256
01:59:27,860 --> 01:59:30,746
Not yogesh, Ramesh... Ramesh... now say!

1257
01:59:30,846 --> 01:59:31,697
One "chutki".

1258
01:59:31,797 --> 01:59:34,459
What is this one "chutki" price.

1259
01:59:36,835 --> 01:59:37,870
Say politely...

1260
01:59:37,970 --> 01:59:41,997
what you know about the value of
one "chutki sindur" Ramesh.

1261
01:59:42,307 --> 01:59:44,009
Blessing of Ishwer...

1262
01:59:44,109 --> 01:59:46,109
Ishwer... what?

1263
01:59:46,345 --> 01:59:49,314
Kill me... kill me...
stupid acting.

1264
01:59:49,414 --> 01:59:52,110
Suhagan's crown...

1265
01:59:52,484 --> 01:59:57,786
one "chutki"...
sindur!

1266
01:59:58,757 --> 02:00:00,757
What else?

1267
02:00:01,126 --> 02:00:04,061
Every women's dream one "chutki sindur"

1268
02:00:05,464 --> 02:00:06,198
say it...

1269
02:00:06,298 --> 02:00:09,893
one "chutki sindur"
every women's dream...

1270
02:00:18,277 --> 02:00:19,778
Auntie who let you in?

1271
02:00:19,878 --> 02:00:23,177
Who you are calling Auntie, old man?
Auntie you mom.

1272
02:00:28,453 --> 02:00:31,980
I would do it myself, if this was 15/20
years later.

1273
02:00:33,859 --> 02:00:36,327
Ok Omi, this was last batch.

1274
02:00:37,996 --> 02:00:39,996
Yeah, but none was like Shanti

1275
02:00:42,067 --> 02:00:43,702
we will find one definitely.

1276
02:00:43,802 --> 02:00:45,137
We don't have enough time Pappu.

1277
02:00:45,237 --> 02:00:52,541
Mukesh Mehra will return in few days,
when, how she will be found?

1278
02:00:55,080 --> 02:00:56,715
Excuse me.
Is Om Kapoor there?

1279
02:00:56,815 --> 02:00:58,450
No, he is not here.

1280
02:00:58,550 --> 02:01:01,519
Its pack up, come tomorrow for audition

1281
02:01:02,020 --> 02:01:08,152
tomorrow?
But watchman said he is in.

1282
02:01:08,961 --> 02:01:13,989
I have come from Bangalore for this,
please give me one chance.

1283
02:01:20,305 --> 02:01:25,572
I am big fan of O.K.
Audition is just an excuse to meet him.

1284
02:01:25,844 --> 02:01:27,844
I just!

1285
02:01:28,213 --> 02:01:30,213
Pappu please turn on the lights.

1286
02:03:37,109 --> 02:03:40,629
Papa... hero is here!
Really, its only 11 o'clock

1287
02:03:40,729 --> 02:03:42,729
Apahij Pyar short three take one.

1288
02:03:52,057 --> 02:03:56,118
Excuse me, take one more,
I can do better than this.

1289
02:04:38,103 --> 02:04:42,062
What you know about the value of
one "chutki sindur"

1290
02:04:42,174 --> 02:04:46,770
blessings of god one "chutki sindur"

1291
02:04:47,679 --> 02:04:52,567
blessings of god one "chutki sindur"

1292
02:04:52,667 --> 02:04:58,522
Suhagan's crown... one "chutki sindur"

1293
02:04:58,723 --> 02:05:05,458
Suhagan's crown... one "chutki sindur"

1294
02:05:09,401 --> 02:05:14,338
why you are laughing? Is this joke,
Pappu she can't be our Shanti.

1295
02:05:14,472 --> 02:05:16,472
She is not like Shanti.

1296
02:05:23,348 --> 02:05:27,409
But you can try,
everyone is trying here.

1297
02:05:33,692 --> 02:05:35,692
You made her cry!

1298
02:05:39,297 --> 02:05:44,599
Om. We all are trying, but she doesn't
even know what this is, and our plan.

1299
02:05:44,736 --> 02:05:48,069
What plan? This is only going to happen
if Mukesh takes her as Shanti.

1300
02:05:49,107 --> 02:05:57,365
She only looks like Shanti, Mukesh
will find out about her then. And the plan fail.

1301
02:05:57,465 --> 02:06:02,443
Om. Then we must tell her everything,
what is this and why this so important.

1302
02:06:02,554 --> 02:06:07,253
Before acting, she has to understand
Shanti,

1303
02:06:10,562 --> 02:06:16,125
Om Shanti Om is my life story,
and I should have told you earlier.

1304
02:06:19,237 --> 02:06:26,439
Because you can't be Shanti if you
don't feel the pain of Om.

1305
02:06:28,413 --> 02:06:34,648
But if I would tell it,
no one would believe in this story.

1306
02:06:37,822 --> 02:06:39,157
Not even you.

1307
02:06:39,257 --> 02:06:46,891
Me? You jump from the 50th floor and
stand and I believe you.

1308
02:06:48,800 --> 02:06:52,497
You save a heroine from 100 villains,
I believe you.

1309
02:06:54,873 --> 02:07:03,212
You fly, walk on water, I believe everything,
then why you think I won't believe this story?

1310
02:07:15,226 --> 02:07:22,223
There is still time,
this time I will truly try.

1311
02:08:15,487 --> 02:08:18,684
Mommy?
I am glad, fool.

1312
02:08:27,332 --> 02:08:31,860
In such a short time you got
sad script and heroine.

1313
02:08:33,605 --> 02:08:36,233
My people have already arranged
the opening ceremony

1314
02:08:37,842 --> 02:08:43,872
this ceremony, prays... is this
all necessary?

1315
02:08:46,885 --> 02:08:52,414
I don't believe in this too, that's why
we have arrange something different

1316
02:09:31,496 --> 02:09:35,364
from all the places you find this
place?

1317
02:09:35,700 --> 02:09:41,036
You know... yeah, this is the place where
fire burned the whole set.

1318
02:09:42,574 --> 02:09:44,574
I know everything,
that's why I have chosen this place.

1319
02:09:49,414 --> 02:09:53,441
Start unfinished story from the same
place where it left

1320
02:09:58,656 --> 02:10:01,887
Sir, why you started Om Shanti Om,
if we won't start then how it will finish?

1321
02:10:06,464 --> 02:10:08,464
And that's the director of this film.

1322
02:10:13,805 --> 02:10:19,072
You should have ask me once.

1323
02:10:19,377 --> 02:10:22,039
There are many things ahead which
you were never asked.

1324
02:10:26,551 --> 02:10:29,611
You can call him Mukesh Mehra.

1325
02:10:33,057 --> 02:10:36,117
Heroine of this movie, what's her name?
Dolly.

1326
02:10:44,435 --> 02:10:46,699
You will like her she is very
sexy.

1327
02:10:57,849 --> 02:10:59,849
No... no... she is Dolly's mom.

1328
02:11:02,487 --> 02:11:07,390
What's her name?
Kamani Jee.

1329
02:11:09,027 --> 02:11:17,385
Baby was so excited even not sleeping, I
mention her dark circles then she dozed off.

1330
02:11:17,485 --> 02:11:20,631
I never compromise with my
beauty sleep.

1331
02:11:21,005 --> 02:11:23,005
Yeah, I can see that.

1332
02:11:26,778 --> 02:11:28,778
Baby?

1333
02:11:59,577 --> 02:12:01,577
Baby, respectfully greet him.

1334
02:12:05,516 --> 02:12:09,532
Pappu, we are coming at the set
is Mom ready?

1335
02:12:09,632 --> 02:12:12,215
Yeah Mommy is ready, but she is
over acting...

1336
02:12:12,557 --> 02:12:14,557
that's our family problem.

1337
02:12:17,161 --> 02:12:18,796
Hey Mommy, let's move.

1338
02:12:18,896 --> 02:12:22,832
What move, you don't understand,
let me come in my character.

1339
02:12:23,268 --> 02:12:26,203
Move, move everything is ready there.

1340
02:12:26,537 --> 02:12:28,537
Forget my line.
Don't go inside.

1341
02:12:29,641 --> 02:12:31,641
I need ponytail like Mike
in my next movie.

1342
02:12:36,914 --> 02:12:38,914
What happened, Mikey?

1343
02:12:39,007 --> 02:12:40,418
Why you put set here?

1344
02:12:40,518 --> 02:12:46,252
I told you about that circle of life...
I know...

1345
02:12:57,235 --> 02:13:02,557
Don't go inside...
Don't go inside...

1346
02:13:02,657 --> 02:13:10,981
She is waiting for you.
She won't spare you.

1347
02:13:11,082 --> 02:13:13,550
Who?
Who won't spare him?

1348
02:13:14,852 --> 02:13:16,852
Shanti...

1349
02:13:19,957 --> 02:13:24,279
Don't cry baby, you care about your
eye liner, she is a mad mommy.

1350
02:13:24,379 --> 02:13:26,991
Is any one inside?

1351
02:13:33,304 --> 02:13:36,671
Nice set, Mikey?

1352
02:14:00,298 --> 02:14:02,298
He is villain of our movie like you.

1353
02:14:04,302 --> 02:14:06,302
Coconut breaking time.

1354
02:14:13,778 --> 02:14:17,839
Take it for Shanti,
Om Shanti, Shanti Om.

1355
02:14:20,318 --> 02:14:25,255
It will break in first try, or its not
a good sign.

1356
02:14:30,027 --> 02:14:34,760
It didn't break... no problem,
try again.

1357
02:14:40,104 --> 02:14:42,971
Bad luck let me do it.
No... I will do it.

1358
02:14:49,680 --> 02:14:57,985
No problem Mikey, who breaks coconut
in Hollywood.

1359
02:15:00,224 --> 02:15:06,288
But here we break coconut before
every kind of work.

1360
02:15:21,078 --> 02:15:32,182
At this time tribute to the actress
whom this film was written.

1361
02:15:33,458 --> 02:15:40,921
I believe where ever she is,
she is looking at us.

1362
02:15:55,746 --> 02:16:02,811
Now, I request Dolly to light the
dia, and take blessings from her.

1363
02:16:02,954 --> 02:16:05,855
Come on Dolly, I will move there.

1364
02:16:15,466 --> 02:16:18,162
By pressing this button there will
be spark at the photo.

1365
02:16:18,269 --> 02:16:21,796
If that won't happen...
I will give you slap.

1366
02:16:40,892 --> 02:16:45,829
Its not working, what happened.
I think that's wire's problem.

1367
02:16:59,877 --> 02:17:01,877
Someone help with fire.

1368
02:17:08,219 --> 02:17:10,219
Don't go inside...

1369
02:17:12,356 --> 02:17:18,124
wow Mommy, nice acting,
here's iron coconut for you.

1370
02:17:19,430 --> 02:17:22,524
Here's fake eyebrow for me.

1371
02:17:24,135 --> 02:17:26,135
It was fun, right?

1372
02:17:27,004 --> 02:17:30,531
No... big fun is tomorrow.

1373
02:17:31,075 --> 02:17:33,075
You know the plan?

1374
02:17:34,979 --> 02:17:39,143
What if I made mistake,
no... no... you won't. Don't be nervous

1375
02:17:39,250 --> 02:17:41,275
Lets discuss the plan once again.

1376
02:17:43,187 --> 02:17:46,884
Everyone will be there at the
shooting tomorrow.

1377
02:17:47,825 --> 02:17:50,123
Baby don't SMS, practice for the
dialogues

1378
02:17:50,261 --> 02:17:52,261
Mukesh Mehra too.

1379
02:17:56,300 --> 02:17:59,827
Madam your short is ready,
let me refresh my makeup.

1380
02:17:59,937 --> 02:18:01,937
Not yours, Dolly, madam's.

1381
02:18:02,440 --> 02:18:07,901
I will SMS to Mukesh from Dolly's phone.

1382
02:18:10,214 --> 02:18:14,446
I will write "come to makeup room alone."

1383
02:18:20,324 --> 02:18:24,590
And I know him, he will go there.

1384
02:18:28,232 --> 02:18:32,464
Pappu he is coming, go take
Sandy to the room.

1385
02:18:43,180 --> 02:18:47,207
Where is Dolly's mom. Kamani Jee?
She went for the touchup.

1386
02:18:47,918 --> 02:18:50,284
Where?
You know...

1387
02:18:50,388 --> 02:18:54,586
where is she...
where is Auntie?

1388
02:19:11,575 --> 02:19:12,843
Kamani Jee.

1389
02:19:12,943 --> 02:19:16,538
Kamani Jee,
o.k. You.

1390
02:19:16,647 --> 02:19:18,647
Why he is following me?

1391
02:19:21,385 --> 02:19:24,081
You left this makeup compact, I have
come to return it.

1392
02:19:26,023 --> 02:19:29,151
Why you, you should send it
by any spot boy.

1393
02:19:33,964 --> 02:19:36,432
Kamani Jee, one minute come here.

1394
02:19:38,302 --> 02:19:39,103
What are you doing?

1395
02:19:39,203 --> 02:19:48,077
Compact was an excuse actually I wanted
to meet you in person.

1396
02:19:48,179 --> 02:19:49,413
Why?

1397
02:19:49,513 --> 02:19:58,285
Because I always like older women.

1398
02:20:06,097 --> 02:20:12,195
When I saw you first time, I have
known we will have something

1399
02:20:13,304 --> 02:20:19,140
but I never expected that sudden,
you should work for Hollywood.

1400
02:20:20,211 --> 02:20:22,211
I can take you there.

1401
02:20:39,096 --> 02:20:44,585
Mikey! Someone inside.
There is someone inside too...

1402
02:20:44,685 --> 02:20:47,297
Mikey, you look like you have
seen ghost.

1403
02:20:47,772 --> 02:20:50,969
I told baby do not remove the makeup.

1404
02:20:59,450 --> 02:21:04,649
What are you doing Kamani Jee,
Mikey come on nobody is here.

1405
02:21:09,026 --> 02:21:15,556
You saw somebody go out
or came inside,

1406
02:21:19,236 --> 02:21:21,466
By the way Mikey, what you were
doing in Dolly's room?

1407
02:21:21,572 --> 02:21:23,572
Yeah... what you were doing?

1408
02:21:24,275 --> 02:21:27,194
I was looking for bathroom,
I was lost.

1409
02:21:27,294 --> 02:21:31,732
Next time go to my green room for
bathroom, respect women.

1410
02:21:31,832 --> 02:21:34,148
What you say Kamani Jee?
And love too...

1411
02:21:42,126 --> 02:21:48,588
how you feeling, I mean you are not
coming at shoot, everybody miss you.

1412
02:21:52,803 --> 02:21:57,137
Producers have other work too, and
you are there to take care of shooting.

1413
02:21:57,274 --> 02:21:59,708
Yes, of course, I am there.

1414
02:22:00,344 --> 02:22:02,344
Shall we begin the scenes?

1415
02:22:03,180 --> 02:22:06,240
Projectionist put reel number 9.

1416
02:22:06,550 --> 02:22:10,782
You will be surprised.

1417
02:22:13,123 --> 02:22:20,086
I didn't know Ramesh, you love me that
much, and want to marry me, here?

1418
02:22:20,497 --> 02:22:23,651
Forgive me Ramesh, I didn't trust you.

1419
02:22:23,751 --> 02:22:29,662
You are going to land from there
in wedding dress like a fairy.

1420
02:22:33,444 --> 02:22:44,082
Have you seen her?
Who Dolly? No, the other girl.

1421
02:22:44,321 --> 02:22:50,487
Blessings of god one "chutki sindur"
Suhagan's crown... one "chutki sindur"

1422
02:22:50,661 --> 02:22:52,754
don't drink Mikey,
I think you are drunk.

1423
02:22:53,864 --> 02:22:57,095
Every women's dream one "chutki sindur"

1424
02:23:01,739 --> 02:23:04,358
turn off the projector, turn on the lights

1425
02:23:04,458 --> 02:23:08,868
no one is on the screen, it's Dolly.

1426
02:23:11,415 --> 02:23:13,576
Put this reel on once again.

1427
02:23:15,853 --> 02:23:18,651
Watch now, there is no one.

1428
02:23:18,756 --> 02:23:24,319
Blessings of god one "chutki sindur"
Suhagan's crown... one "chutki sindur"

1429
02:23:24,461 --> 02:23:26,895
every women's dream one "chutki sindur"

1430
02:23:31,368 --> 02:23:33,700
see everything is fine.

1431
02:23:33,804 --> 02:23:35,606
How this could happen?

1432
02:23:35,706 --> 02:23:37,706
What could happen?

1433
02:23:37,799 --> 02:23:41,472
I swear O.K. She was here. I
saw her.

1434
02:23:41,612 --> 02:23:44,479
Here, there, where is that girl you
are watching every where.

1435
02:23:44,848 --> 02:23:46,907
At sets, at make room and here too!

1436
02:23:47,685 --> 02:23:51,451
You know everyone is saying
you are insane.

1437
02:23:54,458 --> 02:23:56,458
If the press finds about this...

1438
02:24:01,298 --> 02:24:07,259
so what am I, mad. I am handling
everything alone. You don't even care.

1439
02:24:07,638 --> 02:24:11,802
And this madness, don't know what
happened to you.

1440
02:24:15,212 --> 02:24:20,673
I don't understand what's going on,
I think I should go back to America.

1441
02:24:23,587 --> 02:24:28,422
I will go back on tomorrow night's flight.

1442
02:24:31,261 --> 02:24:35,683
No. Mikey, you can not go back,
I mean in two days we are launching music.

1443
02:24:35,783 --> 02:24:37,434
You have to stay for that.

1444
02:24:37,534 --> 02:24:41,197
No. O.K. I can't stay, I must go back.

1445
02:24:41,538 --> 02:24:43,733
And you can handle music launch.
What's a big deal.

1446
02:24:47,411 --> 02:24:50,938
In the show press, media and
everyone will be there.

1447
02:24:51,281 --> 02:24:52,783
If producer won't there, how it will look.

1448
02:24:52,883 --> 02:24:58,253
And I am not your servant, I can not
handle everything for you.

1449
02:25:07,531 --> 02:25:10,728
One more thing, I can do 10 more
movies.

1450
02:25:10,868 --> 02:25:15,221
And the money you got from market
for Om Shanti Om, if it's stopped again,

1451
02:25:15,321 --> 02:25:17,321
you will be on the road, Mikey.

1452
02:25:19,276 --> 02:25:21,608
You won't do it.

1453
02:25:25,015 --> 02:25:27,313
I can do this, and I will do it.

1454
02:25:28,752 --> 02:25:34,713
If you want this thing done, come to
the music launch.

1455
02:25:47,337 --> 02:25:51,637
You gone mad Om, how we can
prepare everything in two days only.

1456
02:25:51,775 --> 02:25:53,577
This plan was after 3 weeks.

1457
02:25:53,677 --> 02:25:57,408
You were there Pappu, I had no choice,
he was going back to America.

1458
02:25:57,514 --> 02:25:59,514
I though music release would
stop him.

1459
02:25:59,607 --> 02:26:02,347
But how we are going to finish this
plan in two days?

1460
02:26:02,453 --> 02:26:06,719
There are a lot more work to do
at set, artist

1461
02:26:07,558 --> 02:26:09,558
even Sandy is also not ready.

1462
02:26:10,561 --> 02:26:13,291
I will try Om. But if made mistake
then?

1463
02:26:13,597 --> 02:26:15,792
No mistake, Sandy.

1464
02:26:21,672 --> 02:26:28,407
We have to make Mukesh believe
that Shanti has really come back.

1465
02:26:33,584 --> 02:26:36,485
You have to scare him till he
speaks the truth.

1466
02:26:36,620 --> 02:26:38,781
Truth! I have doubt on your plans.

1467
02:26:39,356 --> 02:26:46,956
Scare him like karz movie. Forget it Om
he will run tonight

1468
02:26:47,097 --> 02:26:53,969
if you really need something,
the whole world would come to help you

1469
02:26:56,607 --> 02:27:00,771
he will definitely come,
don't worry.

1470
02:27:01,512 --> 02:27:07,644
Go. Pappu prepare everything,
I know he will come.

1471
02:27:08,752 --> 02:27:11,619
Because the movie still not end.

1472
02:35:05,562 --> 02:35:10,090
Guests will come on flowers sheets
from here.

1473
02:35:10,467 --> 02:35:15,495
There will be 40/30 orchestra playing
only Shanti's songs

1474
02:35:17,007 --> 02:35:22,070
there will be a fountain falling champaign
rather than water.

1475
02:35:23,480 --> 02:35:28,213
And there will be wedding stage right
below this huge lamp.

1476
02:35:29,319 --> 02:35:32,482
Who are you and how you know
all this?

1477
02:35:32,622 --> 02:35:38,254
Yeah, you have discuss all this
with Shanti in person.

1478
02:35:38,395 --> 02:35:48,896
Yeah, but there was someone else too,
who saw your sin, too.

1479
02:35:51,241 --> 02:35:53,627
That was me, Mukesh.

1480
02:35:53,727 --> 02:35:57,135
No, how this could happen?

1481
02:35:59,249 --> 02:36:09,576
That's impossible but that's true.
I died with Shanti too,

1482
02:36:09,676 --> 02:36:18,261
I was junior artist in your big movies,
I couldn't save my Shanti.

1483
02:36:20,036 --> 02:36:22,188
But I will fight for her justice

1484
02:36:22,288 --> 02:36:25,002
you will be punished, Mukesh

1485
02:36:27,043 --> 02:36:29,238
Sandy, its your queue, you know what
you have to do?

1486
02:36:29,379 --> 02:36:32,143
Yeah, but I am afraid.

1487
02:36:32,248 --> 02:36:39,381
Its not time to be scared, its time to scare
him. Everything is up to you now.

1488
02:36:48,565 --> 02:36:56,472
So you going to hang me, by telling your
reincarnation story

1489
02:36:57,307 --> 02:37:03,439
ok let me confess myself, coz. Who is
going to ask me you or duplicate Shanti?

1490
02:37:07,484 --> 02:37:13,047
What were you thinking, you will plan
this whole thing and I will speak the truth?

1491
02:37:16,493 --> 02:37:20,554
You know ghost doesn't get hurt,
there blood don't fall out.

1492
02:37:24,400 --> 02:37:28,598
He knows everything, stop Shanti.

1493
02:37:31,241 --> 02:37:35,268
Pappu, door is jammed.

1494
02:37:39,182 --> 02:37:43,603
Court ask for evidence, and you don't
have it.

1495
02:37:43,703 --> 02:37:46,144
Because if I killed Shanti where is
her body?

1496
02:37:47,157 --> 02:37:49,557
Yet nobody find her body.

1497
02:37:57,400 --> 02:38:01,268
And without evidence, even God
can't harm me.

1498
02:38:02,806 --> 02:38:05,172
I will give the evidence, Mukesh.

1499
02:38:13,683 --> 02:38:17,642
Yeah, I was waiting for you, you don't
have to do stupid acting anymore.

1500
02:38:17,787 --> 02:38:19,787
Stop this rubbish or I...!

1501
02:38:19,871 --> 02:38:24,226
Or what you will kill me?
"Sandy, he knows everything"

1502
02:38:24,360 --> 02:38:27,329
how many times you will kill me?
"Sandy, he knows everything go away"

1503
02:38:27,463 --> 02:38:30,091
shut up both of you, I don't want to
listen your bullshit.

1504
02:38:30,200 --> 02:38:34,068
You have to listen Mukesh,
listen carefully,

1505
02:38:34,204 --> 02:38:39,107
when fire extinguished you came
back again Mukesh

1506
02:38:39,209 --> 02:38:40,510
yeah... so?

1507
02:38:40,610 --> 02:38:42,078
To bury my body.

1508
02:38:42,178 --> 02:38:43,646
This is nonsense.

1509
02:38:43,746 --> 02:38:46,332
I was alive Mukesh, I was breathing.

1510
02:38:46,432 --> 02:38:47,250
How you know all this?

1511
02:38:47,350 --> 02:38:49,152
And you bury me alive.

1512
02:38:49,252 --> 02:38:50,286
How you know all this?

1513
02:38:50,386 --> 02:38:52,684
Here under this lamp,

1514
02:38:53,089 --> 02:38:54,324
who are you?
Stop Sandy!

1515
02:38:54,424 --> 02:38:58,209
Court need evidence?
Evidence will be found.

1516
02:38:58,309 --> 02:39:00,309
Nothing will find here,
nothing is here.

1517
02:39:01,464 --> 02:39:03,625
Shanti's body will be found
under this lamp.

1518
02:39:03,833 --> 02:39:06,700
Shut up, nothing is under this lamp.

1519
02:39:07,103 --> 02:39:08,438
Which you buried that night.

1520
02:39:08,538 --> 02:39:10,538
Nothing is here...

1521
02:40:37,527 --> 02:40:40,155
No. Om you don't kill him.

1522
02:40:42,832 --> 02:40:50,637
No. His is going to die by my hand,
he will die but not with your hand.

1523
02:41:34,250 --> 02:41:36,616
Om... Omi...
Om...

1524
02:42:02,612 --> 02:42:04,612
and you bury me alive.

1525
02:42:05,982 --> 02:42:18,793
Shanti's body will be found
under this lamp.

1526
02:42:33,843 --> 02:42:36,368
Om... I am sorry...

1527
02:43:06,876 --> 02:43:10,607
movie still remain my friend!
