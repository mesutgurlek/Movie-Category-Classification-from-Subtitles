1
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:12,802
Elizabeth.

2
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,200
- How long was I out?
- About six minutes.

3
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:18,471
Thanks.

4
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:22,276
- OK. I'll be right there.
- OK, I'll be outside. Hey, Fran.

5
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,211
What are you still doin' here?

6
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:28,083
- How long you been on?
- Twenty-three.

7
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:30,418
Twenty-three?
Time to go, Elizabeth.

8
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,754
That's not gonna get me
an attending slot.

9
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:35,954
Adams? She needs to know
how to redress her sutures,

10
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:37,724
but then she can be discharged.

11
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:41,096
No, no. Ellis needs an EKG.
I don't like these swollen ankles.

12
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:42,293
- All right.
- Thanks.

13
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:44,769
Hey. I took care of Trauma Two
while you slept.

14
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:47,705
- I wasn't sleeping, I was just...
- You're welcome.

15
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,435
You're on in five and eight.

16
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:55,241
Jenny? You seen Jenny?

17
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:58,250
Sorry. Sorry. I'm here.

18
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:00,616
Hi, Mr. Olarke.
I'm Dr. Masterson.

19
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:02,848
We're gonna need a OBO,
lytes and a UA.

20
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:06,016
Anything I can do to make you
feel more comfortable today?

21
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:08,458
- Marry me?
- Wow.

22
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:10,860
No, I have my own bus pass.

23
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,591
Well, then how could I refuse?

24
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:16,602
Let me just call my sister and see if
I can borrow her dress. You sit tight.

25
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,696
Keep an eye on my fiancê,
and decrease his morphine drip.

26
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:25,242
Doin' OK?

27
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,980
Olear bed four.

28
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:36,215
Sir, you wanna step over...

29
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:41,785
I got it. I got it.

30
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:43,192
I got it.

31
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:47,493
- I was just about to...
- You're welcome.

32
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:02,940
Thank you.

33
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:06,977
UTI progressing into infection.
Pneumonia. Diabetic coma.

34
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:09,112
Una problema con sus riñones.

35
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:12,955
I'll have a Venti, triple-shot,
sugar-free, vanilla, nonfat cappuccino.

36
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:17,321
- Doctor.
- Mr. Olarke?

37
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:18,762
Will you marry me?

38
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:22,393
Of course, Mr. Olarke. But first,
we need to find you a robe. Jenny?

39
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:24,630
Sorry. Sorry. I'm here.

40
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:27,402
Going full Kabuki tonight, Fran?

41
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:30,170
The dark circles
were scaring the patients.

42
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:32,006
And she's got a hot date tonight.

43
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:35,673
Stop! I'm going out to dinner
with my ex and his mother.

44
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:37,944
He still hasn't told her
we're divorced.

45
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:40,815
I won't be responsible for killing
an 80-year-old woman.

46
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,411
I'll trade nights with you.

47
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:45,253
I've gotta go home and sew
six caterpillar costumes

48
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:47,555
with Velcro legs
for Katie's dance class.

49
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:49,686
I don't know
how you guys do it.

50
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:53,529
Nick is totally pushing me for kids.
I don't have time to shave my legs.

51
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,228
- Stop shaving. He'll leave you alone.
- Really?

52
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:59,965
Elizabeth, you're so lucky that all
you have to worry about is work.

53
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:11,178
- Dr. Masterson, are you in there?
- Yeah, I'll be right out.

54
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:15,252
- Ankle in bed two.
- OK, there's no fracture.

55
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:18,313
Just wrap it up
and send him home. Thanks.

56
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:20,120
- Hello?
- Are you really coming?

57
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:21,319
Yes, I'm coming.

58
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:23,589
Good. Because this guy is great.

59
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:25,392
You met him? Is he there?

60
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:27,763
I haven't actually
met him in person.

61
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:30,166
Abby, you're not setting me up
with a stranger.

62
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:33,000
He's a friend of an old friend.
He's really nice.

63
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:35,939
What does that mean,
fat with a good sense of humor?

64
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:37,135
Not again, Abby.

65
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,201
It wasn't easy
to get this guy to come.

66
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,908
He doesn't do this kind of thing either.
Do you girls have to do that here?

67
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:45,746
Do we not have six other rooms
in the house? Help Mommy.

68
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:48,788
I'm in the seventh circle of hell,
you better show up.

69
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,720
I'll be there.
I'm just really busy.

70
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,759
Don't you dare. You don't know
the meaning of the word.

71
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:57,422
I'm doin' you this huge favor here.
Beggars can't be choosers.

72
00:04:57,497 --> 00:05:00,125
I am completely capable
of meeting men on my own.

73
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:04,694
I know. I'd just like you
to meet one who's not bleeding.

74
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:07,763
I've already had
two marriage proposals today.

75
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:09,365
- Marry me.
- Yes, Mr. Olarke.

76
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:11,205
Yes, of course.
Make that three.

77
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:13,142
- I'll see ya at seven.
- It is seven.

78
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:15,545
Thirty. 7:30.
What are you making?

79
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:18,311
Lasagna. Mom's recipe.
No carbohydrate comments.

80
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:22,912
Please. I'm going on a day and a half
of cafeteria salad. Anything'll do.

81
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,980
Who put SpongeBob in the pasta?

82
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:26,616
I gotta go.

83
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,126
So, what are you gonna do?

84
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:30,458
The only other option is Phoenix.

85
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,226
- Would you consider it?
- Phoenix, San Francisco.

86
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:37,599
Old people and melanomas versus
great sushi and desperate women.

87
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,830
Walsh likes you.

88
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:41,533
Dr. Walsh. Gunshot victim,
internal hemorrhaging.

89
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:44,539
- How long have you been here?
- Twelve hours.

90
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:47,543
A few more.

91
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:51,143
- All right, Brett.
- I'll scrub up.

92
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:54,812
Elizabeth.

93
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:56,480
Yes, sir.

94
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:58,353
I was going to wait till tomorrow,

95
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:02,258
but I wanted to let you know
that I've made my decision.

96
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:04,762
I want you to stay on
as an attending physician.

97
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:06,696
Really? Thank you.

98
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,529
- Hey. Hey.
- Thank you, Dr. Walsh.

99
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:10,091
You've earned it.

100
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:12,933
Unlike some others,
you spend more time being concerned

101
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:15,600
with what's best for the patient
than kissing my ass.

102
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:18,041
A risky move, but I like it.

103
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,909
Sir, I can't thank you enough
for this opportunity.

104
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:24,347
There's so much I want to do here.
I can't wait to get started.

105
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:26,317
- Elizabeth?
- Yes?

106
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,822
The only thing I need you
to do right now is go home.

107
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,016
- But, sir, I... I have...
- Go.

108
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:33,820
You've been here 26 hours.

109
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:36,326
I know all.

110
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:55,543
- Dr. Masterson.
- Yeah?

111
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:59,007
I have a bowel obstruction in six.

112
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:02,418
At least, I think that's what it is.
Oan you take a quick peek?

113
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,249
Yeah, of course.

114
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:12,292
- Brett.
- Oongratulations.

115
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:14,731
Thank you. I didn't know
Walsh was gonna...

116
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:17,031
I have an offer in Phoenix.
Life's good.

117
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,298
That's great. That's great.

118
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:20,703
It's fine.

119
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:28,246
- Hey, Abby, it's me.
- Hey.

120
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:30,373
I'm sorry I'm late.
I know. I'm on my way.

121
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:34,284
- Don't worry. Your date's late too.
- Listen. I have good news.

122
00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:37,721
I got the attending position.
I'm staying in San Francisco.

123
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,122
Oh, that's great!
Well, get over here.

124
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:43,651
- We're breakin' out the champagne.
- I'll be there in a minute. Bye.

125
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:00,336
This place is heaven.

126
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,477
It's been photographed
for magazines.

127
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:13,156
Yeah. I think I told you I was
gonna need something furnished.

128
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:14,818
Well, it is furnished.

129
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:16,828
Where's the couch?

130
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:24,562
Do you believe all of this space?

131
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:28,471
Yeah, it's great
for all those raves I'll be throwing.

132
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:35,240
I'm... sensing a "no."

133
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:38,314
Wow, huh?

134
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:41,516
I know. This place
isn't usually available,

135
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:45,387
but the couple's spending all their time
in Palm Springs now.

136
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:26,160
David, I'm just not quite sure
what you're looking for.

137
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,723
Maybe if we could
communicate a little more.

138
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:30,769
Maybe if you could
let me know a bit more

139
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:34,671
about what's going on with you,
with yourjob, your family situation.

140
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,141
- I don't wanna talk about that.
- Here's an idea:

141
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:40,976
Stop looking for a couple
of months. Start again.

142
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:43,140
You've gotta know
where you wanna live.

143
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:45,707
I just... I'm... I'm not...

144
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:47,412
...getting what it is you...

145
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:51,585
Hey, well... no. David.

146
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:53,386
David, are you kidding?

147
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:55,324
Wait, David. Look, come on.

148
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:57,589
A place like this,
it is long gone by now.

149
00:09:57,663 --> 00:10:01,258
No, listen, there's 90 vultures
and just one carcass.

150
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:04,565
All right, fine. I'll call them.

151
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:08,740
He did? OK.

152
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:11,140
Well, right.
As soon as I know.

153
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,405
Thank you so much for your help.

154
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:17,614
Well, it's pretty obvious
why this hasn't rented.

155
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:20,675
There's no one-year lease.
It's a month-to-month sublet.

156
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:23,381
- Why?
- Some family matter.

157
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,754
They were pretty
close-mouthed about it.

158
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:31,356
Wow, what a view.

159
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:44,240
David.

160
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,978
Wow.

161
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:54,513
This is... sensational.

162
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:59,385
Oh, my God.
And it's got the private access?

163
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:00,982
They didn't do much with it,

164
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:05,326
but, I mean, you really
could do something with this.

165
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:07,525
Isn't this gorgeous?

166
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:21,736
Well, there's a few places
in the Richmond we haven't hit yet.

167
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:23,213
I like the couch.

168
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:24,613
The couch.

169
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,311
Good couch.

170
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,352
Good couch.

171
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,242
David. David, come here.

172
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:11,690
- What? What?
- There's nothing worth stealing here.

173
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:14,927
- There's no money, no drugs.
- I'm not stealing anything.

174
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:17,595
OK. I'm sure there's
a homeless shelter nearby.

175
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,230
I will give you money
for cab fare and a good meal.

176
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:22,536
But please, don't blow it
on more beer, OK?

177
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:25,202
I am not homeless. I live here.

178
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:28,873
OK. You can't live here,
because I live here.

179
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:30,279
This is my apartment.

180
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:32,909
- Since when?
- Since I rented it.

181
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:34,350
- You rented it.
- Yeah.

182
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,752
- You know what? I don't need this.
- What?

183
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:39,382
- Rent scam, right?
- What are you talking about?

184
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:43,258
There's probably five other people
who paid deposits and got the keys.

185
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:45,593
- And moved in all their things?
- Yeah... What?

186
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:48,099
This is my stuff. All of this.

187
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:50,431
That's my couch,
that's my coffee table.

188
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,300
Is that a ring?

189
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:54,100
Have you ever heard
of a coaster?

190
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:55,970
Or a trash can, for that matter?

191
00:12:56,042 --> 00:13:00,240
I don't care who you are, you're gonna
mop that up. I'm getting the bucket.

192
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:02,440
It's like a pig
moved into my house.

193
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:04,912
- What?
- Like a filthy pig.

194
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:06,747
You... You moved in when?

195
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:20,596
Hello?

196
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:49,223
- I told you to get out.
- Jesus!

197
00:13:57,803 --> 00:14:00,829
OK. So, what's this all about?

198
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:01,964
What? Nothin'.

199
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,235
Nothin'.

200
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:04,901
So, you called me for nothin'?

201
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:07,445
I've been sort of
seeing someone.

202
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,778
Seeing someone?
That's what I'm talkin' about. Finally.

203
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,842
- You think it's a good thing?
- Absolutely.

204
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:16,945
Yeah. The last time I tried
to hook you up, you bailed out.

205
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:20,117
This is good, and the fact
that you initiated it yourself,

206
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:23,059
that's important. OK?
Now, who is she? Do I know her?

207
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:25,529
I mean I'm seeing someone
that's not there.

208
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:27,589
She's emotionally unavailable?

209
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:33,765
You mean like a hallucination.

210
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:36,668
Twice, in my apartment.

211
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:38,175
A woman.

212
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:39,336
Attractive?

213
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:43,213
- Not really there, Jack.
- Right. Right. OK.

214
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:46,581
So when you saw this woman,
were you drunk?

215
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,011
I mean, I had a little buzz.

216
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:52,182
Dave, don't lie to me,
it doesn't help.

217
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:53,987
OK, fine, I was wasted.

218
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,393
But still, I shouldn't be seeing
some little blonde control freak

219
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:59,090
running around my apartment.

220
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:02,362
Why are you writing this down?
This isn't a session.

221
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:07,372
That's insulting, OK? I'm your friend
Jack here, I'm not charging you.

222
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,635
But if this thing rolls
into a second hour

223
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,768
we're gonna have to work out
some kind of deal. I'm kidding.

224
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:14,972
So, hold on a second.
You were drunk,

225
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:18,210
- you saw this blonde, controlling...
- I gotta stop drinkin'.

226
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:19,979
- No.
- No?

227
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:23,021
Yeah, drink, party.
Just do it with other people.

228
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,649
God gave us alcohol
as a social lubricant.

229
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:28,124
Make men brave,
make women loose.

230
00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:31,425
What is that,
some Berkeley shrink thing?

231
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:33,124
No. Look around you, OK?

232
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,168
See this? This is the world.

233
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:37,463
Join it.

234
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:39,561
Stop swimming around
in your own mind.

235
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:42,903
That is a dangerous neighborhood
you should not go into alone.

236
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:46,240
Oome on, Dave.
It's been two years, man.

237
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:47,973
No more hiding out.

238
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:51,646
Absolutely not.

239
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:43,762
- Are you insane? What are you doing?
- Oh, God, what is this?

240
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,066
I didn't want to,
but I will call the police.

241
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:48,470
I'm sleeping. It's a dream.

242
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:51,476
It's one of those dreams
and you know you're dreaming.

243
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:54,604
- How do you keep getting in here?
- It's you who's in here.

244
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,147
Oh, my.

245
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:58,240
This is more serious than I thought.

246
00:16:58,317 --> 00:16:59,750
Go away, you don't exist.

247
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:01,945
I'm gonna ask you
a series of questions.

248
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,784
I want you to answer honestly.

249
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,586
Has your recent
alcohol consumption increased?

250
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:08,286
Yeah, so?

251
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:12,262
Are you hearing voices or seeing
things that aren't quite real to you?

252
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:14,265
As a matter of fact, yeah.

253
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:18,099
Have you recently sought consult
from a mental health care professional?

254
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,263
What? How do you know?
Stay away from me.

255
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,864
Do you feel paranoid,
like people are out to get you?

256
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:24,773
Why are you asking
so many questions?

257
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:28,176
I'll take that as a yes.
Listen to me.

258
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:31,114
You have fantasized,
quite convincingly,

259
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:35,517
that you've rented an apartment that,
in fact, belongs to somebody else.

260
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:37,783
Pick up that pillow.

261
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:39,983
Pick it up. It's OK.

262
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,027
There's a small red stain
on the back

263
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:44,460
where I once spilled
cherry cough syrup.

264
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,590
Yes, that's it.
How else would I know that?

265
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:51,534
Or the fact that these sheets that
you're now soiling are from Nordstrom.

266
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:54,004
I still have the receipt,
it's in that drawer.

267
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,802
Open it up and check.

268
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,275
I think you need to
come to terms with the fact

269
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:01,006
that you may be mentally ill.

270
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:04,276
- Really?
- Yes.

271
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,809
This is my apartment.
These are my sheets.

272
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:10,548
That's my nightstand.
That's my picture...

273
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:15,325
- Where's my picture?
- What picture?

274
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:18,227
There was a picture there of my...

275
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:21,562
There was a picture
right there on the nightstand.

276
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:24,569
- That was empty when I moved in.
- It was just there.

277
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:27,765
You know what? I've had enough.
I am calling the police.

278
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,899
- No, no, no, no.
- It's too late.

279
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,912
What'd you do to my phone?

280
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:38,783
Why can't I...?

281
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:43,316
You stay right there.

282
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:45,380
I'm gonna use the one in the kitchen.

283
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:54,630
Hey, Grace,
David Abbott here.

284
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,930
The people who sublet
this apartment to me,

285
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:59,470
- do you have their number?
- Is something wrong?

286
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:03,770
No, no. I was just wondering
about the previous tenant, that's all.

287
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:07,778
Well, the woman that I dealt with,
she didn't want to talk about it.

288
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:10,076
It was some kind of
tragedy in the family.

289
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,312
I didn't press for details
'cause I don't need any more drama.

290
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:16,821
- You think this girl died?
- Well, you better hope so.

291
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:19,187
That's the only way
they're gonna get off

292
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:22,091
this month-to-month thing
and give you a real lease.

293
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,460
- That's not exactly the reason I was...
- Oome on, David, grow up.

294
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:27,499
Look, it has a view, a fireplace.

295
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:31,229
People would kill their grandmothers
for a lot less in this city.

296
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,660
- Oan I help you with anything?
- No.

297
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:08,468
I mean, do you believe in this stuff?

298
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,475
Well, you don't until you do.

299
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,408
That's a little dated.

300
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:17,074
I recommend the Rosemary Preston.
It's totally seminal.

301
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:20,016
'Scuse me.
Where's your UFO section?

302
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:21,950
It's back and to the left.

303
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:25,353
Ufology. It's not even
a real science.

304
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:27,722
So, what kind of encounter
have you had?

305
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:30,159
- Encounter?
- Ectoplasm?

306
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,220
Soniferous ether?

307
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:35,824
I have a killer sêance book
if you're into communication.

308
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,096
Oommunicating is not her problem.

309
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:42,504
Righteous.
I have exactly what you need.

310
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:49,641
Yeah.

311
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:54,316
Orap!

312
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:57,911
There.

313
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,923
"Spirit, awake.

314
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:05,129
Spirit, partake.

315
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:08,166
Spirit, without fear.

316
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:10,895
Spirit, appear."

317
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:17,136
Are... are you here?

318
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:21,305
Oome on, I think you're here.

319
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,475
OK.

320
00:21:27,553 --> 00:21:30,488
I've got a hot, moist
cup of coffee in my hand.

321
00:21:30,556 --> 00:21:33,150
There is no coaster on this table.

322
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:36,854
I'm going to set it down
on this lovely mahogany...

323
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:38,487
Don't you dare!

324
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:41,127
We... We need to talk.

325
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,258
About what?

326
00:21:44,837 --> 00:21:48,864
Has it crossed your mind that there
might be something a little off

327
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:51,774
about the way you've
been spending your days?

328
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:55,371
Actually, yes. It's weird having
a squatter in your living room.

329
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:56,971
I am not...

330
00:21:58,617 --> 00:21:59,879
OK, let's start over.

331
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:01,852
Hi, I'm David Abbott.

332
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,820
And you are...?

333
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:05,982
I am...

334
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:10,787
I'm Elizabeth.
My name is Elizabeth.

335
00:22:10,863 --> 00:22:13,889
You didn't know that.
You... you had to read that.

336
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:16,457
I think I know my own name.

337
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:19,868
OK. When was the last time
that you remember

338
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:22,771
actually talking to someone
other than me?

339
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:25,275
The other day. The other day.

340
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:28,006
And... And when you're not here,

341
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,345
what do you do
with the rest of your day?

342
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:34,317
Oertainly a lot more
than you do, that's for sure.

343
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:36,513
Let's not stray from the point, Lizzie.

344
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:38,988
Don't call me Lizzie.
I'm not in kindergarten.

345
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:41,719
- My name's Elizabeth.
- You think. Let me ask you,

346
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:44,626
has anything dramatic
happened to you recently?

347
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:45,890
Like what?

348
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:48,489
I don't know, like dying maybe?

349
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:49,966
How dare you say that to me?

350
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,229
OK, calm down.

351
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:53,771
Get your hands off of me, you pervert!

352
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:56,433
Oalm down. I'm not...
I'm not here to hurt you.

353
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:58,840
I'm trying to help you
face the fact that...

354
00:22:58,911 --> 00:23:00,640
- I'm not dead.
- Look around you.

355
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,304
There should be a bright light.

356
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:05,009
- There's no light.
- Walk into the light, Elizabeth!

357
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:09,281
There is no light! I am not dead!
I think I would know if I was dead!

358
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,951
What's happening to me?

359
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:17,290
You're dead!

360
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:19,455
Stop saying that!

361
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:20,862
Missed.

362
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:25,695
OK. OK, that's enough.
That's enough.

363
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:28,365
You're just giving me a headache!
Get off of me!

364
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,805
OK. All right, all right.

365
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:32,139
It's not my fault
you're the way you are.

366
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,678
- I just want you out of my house.
- You get out!

367
00:23:38,283 --> 00:23:40,342
Rest in peace.

368
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:41,613
I'm not leaving.

369
00:23:58,303 --> 00:23:59,895
Another one, my, my.

370
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:03,531
Golden State playing very well...

371
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:06,476
I love ya
Tomorrow

372
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:10,572
You're only a day away

373
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:13,743
Tomorrow, tomorrow

374
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:16,720
I love ya
Tomorrow

375
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:21,225
You're only a day away

376
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,624
Fine!

377
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:27,925
The sun'll come out
Tomorrow

378
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,935
Bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow

379
00:24:31,003 --> 00:24:33,369
You know what? That's it.
I've had it with you.

380
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:36,202
I've tried to be nice,
but now you're outta here!

381
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:38,606
The power of Ohrist compels you!

382
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:41,475
The power of Ohrist compels you!

383
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:44,208
The power of Ohrist compels you!

384
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:47,547
The power of Ohrist compels you!

385
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:49,382
He can't even see me.

386
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:50,716
A little more left.

387
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:53,485
- You're mopping that up.
- More, more.

388
00:25:01,767 --> 00:25:04,099
They're gonna set off
the smoke detector.

389
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,167
Dad, we got it!

390
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:23,918
All set, sir. We have the spirit.

391
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:25,217
A butter dish.

392
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:28,089
- You sure?
- Oh, definitely.

393
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,957
I have him right here.

394
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,655
I'm gonna go give him a flush.

395
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:38,461
That's it?

396
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,004
You just sit there?

397
00:25:40,072 --> 00:25:43,769
Hey, you want bells and whistles
or a reading?

398
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:45,867
Oome on.
He can't see me, either.

399
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:50,005
- For some hideous reason, only you can.
- OK, there's somethin'.

400
00:25:50,082 --> 00:25:52,050
Definitely a presence.

401
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:54,551
How original. Tell me more.

402
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:56,553
It's hostile.

403
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:58,179
Wants you outta here.

404
00:25:58,256 --> 00:25:59,951
Actually, he's not bad.

405
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:01,515
You should move, dude.

406
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:04,228
- I should move?
- I would.

407
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:05,661
I like him.

408
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:07,323
No, I'm not gonna move.

409
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,764
Oan't you feel that, man?

410
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:11,667
There's like this
cancer-causing ray of spirit hate

411
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:14,797
- searing right towards your body.
- This kid's got a gift.

412
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:16,898
- I'm not moving!
- Why not?

413
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:19,375
It's not like it's that great
an apartment.

414
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:20,706
- What?
- Yes, it is.

415
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:22,713
- It's got a view.
- And a fireplace.

416
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:23,873
Whatever, dude.

417
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:26,417
Yo, do you have,
like, a diet anything?

418
00:26:26,485 --> 00:26:29,079
I'm, like, 99.9 percent
parched here.

419
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:30,883
Oould really use a cola.

420
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:33,718
Yeah. Oome on.

421
00:26:43,135 --> 00:26:46,002
Move out?
That... that can't be it.

422
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:48,904
Oould you talk to her
and tell her she should pass on?

423
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:50,874
"Oould you please talk to her?"

424
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:53,001
- I'm ignoring you.
- I'm ignoring you.

425
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:56,536
She won't accept that she's dead.
I told her to walk to the light.

426
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:57,673
She wouldn't do it.

427
00:26:57,749 --> 00:27:01,014
That's because there is no light.
God, you're infuriating!

428
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:02,678
Wait, what's goin' on?

429
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:07,018
You know what?
Do you think I like this?

430
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:08,787
Do you think this is easy for me?

431
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,795
I know something's different,
something is not right.

432
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:13,888
- I'm walking through walls.
- You know,

433
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,489
I don't think I can help you.

434
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:18,798
This is one of the most
alive spirits I've ever been around.

435
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:21,202
- She's not goin' anywhere.
- What do you mean?

436
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:24,640
I agree with her, dude.
She's not dead.

437
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:30,007
But you, whoa.

438
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:32,743
You gotta deal with this...

439
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:40,315
'Oause seriously, that's like
the darkest aura I've ever seen.

440
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:43,953
Suckin' the life right outta you.
It's killin' you, man.

441
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:46,561
You have to let her go, dude.

442
00:27:46,631 --> 00:27:49,623
How can I, when she won't leave?

443
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:51,464
Not your spirit girl.

444
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:53,504
I'm talkin' 'bout the other one.

445
00:27:53,572 --> 00:27:55,631
The one you're keepin' in here.

446
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:58,141
That's what's really
haunting you, isn't it?

447
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,877
- I don't want to talk about that.
- I get it.

448
00:28:01,947 --> 00:28:03,471
You were dumped.

449
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:06,915
Probably for some guy who doesn't
have a couch fused to his ass.

450
00:28:06,985 --> 00:28:07,974
Shut up.

451
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:10,021
You can dish it out
but you can't take it?

452
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:14,024
You bring Father Flanagan
and the Joy Luck Olub to get rid of me.

453
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:16,219
But I talk about you
getting dumped once...

454
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:19,889
You don't know what the hell
you're talking about. Shut the hell up!

455
00:28:19,965 --> 00:28:22,024
Sorry for your loss, bro.

456
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,304
A word to the wise, girl.

457
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,567
Show some respect for the dead.

458
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:40,243
David?

459
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:44,982
I'm sorry.

460
00:28:47,993 --> 00:28:50,587
It occurred to me now that I...

461
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:52,994
...probably don't know you
all that well.

462
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:58,466
I got this place for the roof.

463
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:02,697
I was gonna do
a whole garden out here...

464
00:29:03,275 --> 00:29:06,073
...eventually, I think.

465
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:07,941
Now I'm babbling.

466
00:29:08,013 --> 00:29:09,480
I...

467
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:12,013
I'm really sorry.

468
00:29:13,818 --> 00:29:17,811
Most people who deal with loss really
find it helpful to talk about things.

469
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:20,084
I don't want to talk about it!

470
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:22,149
Anger works too.

471
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,829
Who was he talking about?

472
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:29,162
Laura. Her name was Laura.

473
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:31,168
Who's Laura?

474
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:33,067
She was my wife.

475
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:41,903
What do you think I am, stupid?

476
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,642
What is this? Oh, come on.

477
00:29:49,688 --> 00:29:52,248
Don't. This is not gonna help.

478
00:29:52,324 --> 00:29:55,122
How would you know? Have
you ever been in a bar in your life?

479
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,124
The groundhog emerges!

480
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:07,137
I didn't think you'd make it.
All right! All right!

481
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:10,072
It's Jeff, Jody, Kim, Valerie.

482
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,472
This is my buddy, Dave.

483
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:13,602
- Nice to meet you.
- What are you drinkin'?

484
00:30:13,678 --> 00:30:15,202
- Ooffee.
- Scotch!

485
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,145
- Don't you dare!
- Make it a double!

486
00:30:17,215 --> 00:30:20,412
You don't have to wait.
I can start the hangover right now.

487
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,220
Yeah. Yeah.

488
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:26,382
He's excited to be out. I know!

489
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:27,584
Friday night!

490
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,219
- You can't drink these feelings away.
- Watch me.

491
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:33,928
So, you OK?

492
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:37,298
Say goodbye, walk to the door,
let's get some food in your stomach.

493
00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:39,098
Who made you my mother?

494
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:41,636
Did I...?

495
00:30:41,706 --> 00:30:44,231
How you comin' along
with those hallucinations?

496
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:46,800
- That was nothing.
- You're not a well man, David.

497
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:50,177
- It's just a lack of sleep.
- Sleep? You gettin' any?

498
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:51,943
- Eight hours.
- Twelve.

499
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:55,248
- Nine, tops.
- Opium addicts are more alert than you.

500
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,845
- Will you knock it off.
- Don't you dare!

501
00:30:57,922 --> 00:30:59,480
Don't!

502
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:00,581
Last chance.

503
00:31:00,658 --> 00:31:02,751
What are you gonna do about it?

504
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:15,164
Dave, buddy!

505
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,111
I'm so...

506
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,278
I'm sorry. God!

507
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:28,819
- You freak!
- Dave, that is uncool, man!

508
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:36,352
Good God!

509
00:31:36,428 --> 00:31:38,623
You're gonna thank me
for that one day.

510
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:42,427
For what? Making me look like a lunatic
in front of all those people?

511
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:57,578
Why are you still here?

512
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:02,145
That's a scary question.
I have no idea.

513
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,983
Why are you the only one
that can see me?

514
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:05,386
Don't ask me.

515
00:32:06,524 --> 00:32:10,790
All I know is when I'm not with you,
it's like I don't... exist.

516
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,393
Oh, my God.

517
00:32:14,466 --> 00:32:16,127
Maybe I am dead.

518
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:20,998
Oh, come on now.

519
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:25,202
I'm... I'm sorry
that I said you're dead.

520
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:26,743
Maybe you're not dead.

521
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:29,609
Maybe you're just very... light.

522
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:35,011
If I could just remember something
about who I am, or was.

523
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:37,316
I mean, then I'd know
once and for all.

524
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,358
I'm trying to figure it out. I...

525
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:44,292
I just can't do it by myself.

526
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:50,791
You're not asking me to...
to help you, are you?

527
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:52,268
Look.

528
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:54,396
You have two realities
to choose from.

529
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:57,168
First one being that a woman
has come into your life

530
00:32:57,242 --> 00:33:00,803
in a very unconventional way
and she happens to need your assistance.

531
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:02,312
Right.

532
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,974
The second one is that
you're an insane person,

533
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:07,347
sitting on a park bench
talking to yourself.

534
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:11,479
I think I prefer the first one.

535
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:13,285
OK.

536
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:14,791
Let's find out who I am.

537
00:33:20,565 --> 00:33:23,796
No. I think that apartment was vacant.

538
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:25,566
That was a woman?

539
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:28,662
Nobody live there.

540
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:31,174
It's like I was a ghost
before I was dead.

541
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,638
Hi. Oan I help you?

542
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:38,409
Finally, somebody normal.
I bet we were friends.

543
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:40,974
Hi, I'm... I'm David.
I am a new tenant here.

544
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:43,452
Hi, David, Katrina.
Oome on in.

545
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:46,581
- She's friendly, I like her.
- This'll just take a sec.

546
00:33:46,658 --> 00:33:50,526
I have a question. The apartment
upstairs, it belonged to a young woman.

547
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:52,893
Yeah, I think there
was somebody up there.

548
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:55,125
But she was, like, totally antisocial.

549
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,464
OK, maybe we weren't close friends.

550
00:33:57,535 --> 00:34:00,698
Kinda like a cat lady,
but without any cats.

551
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:02,171
Right?

552
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,435
OK, I think we're done here. Let's go.

553
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:06,909
- OK, thank you.
- Look. This is so retro,

554
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:09,310
but I've got a window
I can't get open.

555
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,177
- She's got to be kidding.
- What?

556
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:12,273
- What?
- What?

557
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,181
She wants you to come in.

558
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:15,776
Well, if it's painted shut

559
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:18,651
and you use a screwdriver
to jam it, it sometimes...

560
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,190
Oh, tried it.

561
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:21,850
Won't budge.

562
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:24,895
No preliminaries. Incredible.

563
00:34:24,963 --> 00:34:27,830
I'd like to help,
but I have dinner plans.

564
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,958
Well, I got dessert.

565
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:31,661
I just threw up in my mouth.

566
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,261
Well, OK. I...

567
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:36,996
Nice to meet you.

568
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,542
- You too, Dave.
- Thanks.

569
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:42,304
Why is she wearing workout clothes?

570
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:45,076
If you were gonna work out
in the middle of the day,

571
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:49,051
the only reason to wear workout clothes,
do you really need a push-up bra?

572
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,917
The whole point's
to strap 'em down.

573
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:54,652
- You're not comin' with me anymore.
- Why? Something mightjog my memory.

574
00:34:54,726 --> 00:34:59,060
Too bad. You're like an AM radio someone
shoved in my head and I can't turn off.

575
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:02,861
You don't think she was
completely un-classy and predatory?

576
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,425
Those happen to be
two of men's favorite things.

577
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:08,563
- Why don't you just date a pit bull?
- Maybe I will.

578
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,574
- Damn it!
- What?

579
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:13,700
I locked my key in the apartment.

580
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:16,508
There's a spare key
under the fire extinguisher.

581
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:20,711
I mean, I guess she's sexy if you're
into that whole tall, big boobs,

582
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:23,015
long legs, model-y sorta thing.

583
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:25,282
I guess if you wanna be that guy.

584
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:27,085
There are five other units here,

585
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:30,127
and not one person even
remembers what you look like.

586
00:35:30,194 --> 00:35:32,025
Talk about being disconnected.

587
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:35,691
- Are you sure you really want that?
- Yes, I'm sure.

588
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:38,730
Next drawer on the left.

589
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:44,066
There's a funnel in there too,
if you need it.

590
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:49,005
- Oheck it out.
- What is it?

591
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,206
New leads.

592
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:52,545
Look, there's an address
written on here.

593
00:35:52,617 --> 00:35:55,211
I can't make that out.
Is that a five or a six?

594
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:56,810
I think it's a...

595
00:35:56,888 --> 00:35:59,322
No, no, no, that's a five.
Definitely a five.

596
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:02,985
So we have an address, a dry cleaning
ticket and a book of matches.

597
00:36:03,061 --> 00:36:04,460
You know what that means?

598
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:07,828
- We could start a very small fire?
- There's still hope.

599
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:10,993
Oh, yes, these pants were jet black.

600
00:36:11,069 --> 00:36:12,229
Armani, I believe.

601
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:14,362
I remember them.
They were expensive.

602
00:36:14,439 --> 00:36:17,602
Do you remember anything else
about the woman? It's important.

603
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:20,109
She's pleasant,
but a little dull maybe.

604
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,372
- Dull?
- Dull?

605
00:36:21,446 --> 00:36:25,348
I think of her,
I think of sadness, loneliness.

606
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:28,180
I don't need a psychological
profile from this guy.

607
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:30,743
- Oan we just get the pants?
- Oan I get the pants?

608
00:36:30,822 --> 00:36:33,416
Ltem left too long.
We give them to homeless shelter.

609
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:35,982
Are you insane? They were Armani.

610
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,426
OK, let's go.

611
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:41,059
Are you coming or not?

612
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:43,259
They're pants,
what do you need 'em for?

613
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:56,472
425, I think.

614
00:36:57,749 --> 00:37:00,479
- Look familiar?
- Not really.

615
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:08,155
Hi.

616
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:11,088
Hello.

617
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,829
- Oan I help you?
- Hi.

618
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:17,698
This might sound a little odd, but I was
wondering if you knew a certain woman.

619
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:20,567
Blond, about five-foot-one...

620
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:22,538
- Two. And a half.
- Two and a half?

621
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:25,007
Oh, my God. Who are you?

622
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,304
I don't know you. I...

623
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:29,175
- Did my wife hire you?
- I'm sorry, what?

624
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,908
I knew she'd find out.

625
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:33,314
Whatever she's payin' you,
I'll double it.

626
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:35,978
- Anything you want.
- I'm not looking for money.

627
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:38,681
- Donald! Who is it?
- That's her. Oome back around six.

628
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:39,950
I'll have a check ready.

629
00:37:45,797 --> 00:37:47,287
Wow.

630
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:54,165
What? You don't think I actually
had sex with that old horndog.

631
00:37:54,238 --> 00:37:58,004
- Kinda looks that way, Lizzie.
- It's Elizabeth. And that's disgusting.

632
00:37:58,075 --> 00:38:01,943
Well, look on the bright side.
At 6:00, I'm coming into some money.

633
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:07,411
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

634
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:13,884
Oh, my God.

635
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:16,620
Maybe I was a slut.

636
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:19,629
A lonely, home-wrecking slut.

637
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:33,739
So what if I was a slut? There's nothing
wrong with a healthy sexual appetite.

638
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:34,800
Not at all.

639
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:38,042
Look who I'm talking to,
Mr. Tried To Feel Me Up One Time.

640
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:40,106
I'm trying to agree with you.

641
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:41,776
- David.
- What?

642
00:38:41,853 --> 00:38:43,184
This is it.

643
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:45,245
You recognize it? Good.

644
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,847
OK. Oome on.

645
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:55,322
This is Moose's.
I love this restaurant.

646
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:57,264
- You ate here a lot.
- No.

647
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,734
- No.
- I never did.

648
00:38:58,803 --> 00:39:02,136
I remember looking in that window
and wishing I could eat in here.

649
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:05,767
What, were you a homeless
street urchin? Why didn't you?

650
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:08,334
I wanted to,
I just never got around to it.

651
00:39:09,614 --> 00:39:12,913
Maybe the dry-cleaner guy
was right about me.

652
00:39:12,984 --> 00:39:14,645
Hello, can I help you?

653
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:17,085
No, thank you.
Maybe some other time.

654
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:18,944
Kenny!

655
00:39:19,891 --> 00:39:22,189
Lvan, call 911,
we need an ambulance!

656
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,887
- Are you OK?
- Undo his collar.

657
00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:25,758
- Is he breathing?
- I can't tell.

658
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:29,163
- Maybe we should do mouth-to-mouth.
- God. We need a doctor.

659
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:30,894
We really have to find a doctor.

660
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:33,766
Is there a doctor here? Anyone?

661
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:35,499
- Feel his chest.
- What?

662
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:37,905
His chest,
check and see if it's bloated.

663
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:39,772
- How would I know?
- Just do it!

664
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:43,841
Excuse me. Pardon me.
I need to feel his chest.

665
00:39:43,915 --> 00:39:45,212
Oan you feel his ribs?

666
00:39:45,283 --> 00:39:47,478
No, but I can if I press down.

667
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:49,850
- What are you doing?
- Does he feel bloated?

668
00:39:49,921 --> 00:39:51,320
- I think so.
- Think what?

669
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:54,881
Tell them you'll need a sharp
paring knife and a bottle of vodka.

670
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:57,393
I need a sharp paring knife
and a bottle of vodka.

671
00:39:57,461 --> 00:39:58,553
- Ivan?
- Yeah, got it.

672
00:39:58,629 --> 00:40:00,995
- What's wrong?
- It's a tension pneumothorax.

673
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:03,295
- It's a tension nemothaxer.
- Pneumothorax.

674
00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:05,028
- Pneumothaxer.
- Pneumothorax.

675
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:06,399
- Pneumathurman.
- Never mind.

676
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:09,132
- Never mind!
- But what is it?

677
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:11,470
Air is escaping
out of the lungs into his chest.

678
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:13,271
...out of his lungs into his chest.

679
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:14,971
- Open his shirt.
- Open his shirt.

680
00:40:15,046 --> 00:40:16,513
- No, you do it.
- I'll do it.

681
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:19,573
A valve at the opening of the lungs.
If it doesn't close,

682
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:22,881
it constricts the lungs
and compresses the organs.

683
00:40:22,954 --> 00:40:26,082
I want you to feel for his ribs
again. A little bit lower.

684
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:28,455
The spot between two ribs,
do you feel that?

685
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:30,585
OK, splash some vodka on it.

686
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:32,993
- All right. Get the knife.
- OK.

687
00:40:34,966 --> 00:40:37,867
Oan I ask everyone just
to stand back a little bit here?

688
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:41,098
A little bit further, please.
A little bit further. Thank you.

689
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:44,107
- What am I doing with the knife?
- Make an incision.

690
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:46,302
You know what? No.

691
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:49,778
- David, this man's life is at stake.
- I... I can't stab a man.

692
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:52,042
OK. There's nothing to be afraid of.

693
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,516
You're gonna make
a hole for the air to escape.

694
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:56,780
So put the knife on that spot.

695
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:58,583
Oh, my God.
How do you know this?

696
00:40:58,656 --> 00:41:01,989
I don't know, I just do. Now do it!
Put the knife there.

697
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:04,687
Now, you're gonna need
to push harder than that.

698
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:06,423
- A little bit harder.
- Oh, God!

699
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:08,055
OK! OK, good! That's enough.

700
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:11,124
All right, now, take the pourer
out of the vodka bottle.

701
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:13,136
- What?
- You're doing good. Now...

702
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:14,262
Hold on.

703
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,641
- Go.
- Put the pourer in the hole you made.

704
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:21,700
What?

705
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:24,509
It's gonna keep the wound open
so air can escape. Do it!

706
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:26,573
- I can't.
- Do it.

707
00:41:29,754 --> 00:41:31,722
- He's breathing.
- He's breathing!

708
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:33,416
He's breathing!

709
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:34,924
I'm a doctor.

710
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:36,084
I'm a doctor!

711
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,823
I know. Thank God. The ambulance
will be here right away.

712
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:42,024
Ask him where the nearest hospital is.

713
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:44,158
Do you know where
the nearest hospital is?

714
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:45,725
A few blocks, St. Matthews.

715
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:47,794
- Thank you.
- St. Matthews?

716
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:51,239
I may have been a home-wrecking
whore, but I saved lives.

717
00:41:51,308 --> 00:41:54,573
I worked in that hospital.
I know it, it sounds so familiar.

718
00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:57,239
- I've never saved a life before.
- It's the best.

719
00:41:57,314 --> 00:42:00,579
One minute you're looking at
this monitor, it says "game over,"

720
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:03,245
then you bring it back,
a little blip and it's there!

721
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:06,153
- What's that?
- That's just a little blood.

722
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,249
David?

723
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:18,595
- I work here.
- You did?

724
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:21,502
The receptionist, her name is Amita.

725
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:23,164
It's all coming back to me now.

726
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,208
There's Bill and Karen

727
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:27,710
and Michael and...

728
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:31,111
Elizabeth? You mean Elizabeth Masterson?

729
00:42:31,182 --> 00:42:35,118
- Masterson. Yes, that's my name.
- Yes, that's it. Elizabeth Masterson.

730
00:42:36,487 --> 00:42:39,149
Dr. Masterson is...

731
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:42,989
...is not active on our staff right now.

732
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,392
Hold on. Let me talk to someone.

733
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:48,356
Excuse me, doctor?

734
00:42:48,432 --> 00:42:50,024
Oh, no, she's got the tone.

735
00:42:50,101 --> 00:42:51,534
- What tone?
- The tone.

736
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:54,298
You're trying to pass the buck
onto somebody else

737
00:42:54,371 --> 00:42:56,362
to tell you your friend died!

738
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,237
Excuse me, sir.

739
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:02,040
I need you to go to
the third-floor nurses' station.

740
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:06,712
Oh, no, it's Fran. She's my mentor.

741
00:43:06,784 --> 00:43:08,877
They wouldn't send us
here if it wasn't bad.

742
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:10,181
- Mr. Abbott?
- Hi, yes.

743
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:11,778
- Fran Lo.
- Nice to meet you.

744
00:43:11,856 --> 00:43:14,654
You've been inquiring
about Elizabeth Masterson?

745
00:43:14,725 --> 00:43:17,489
Right. Oould you tell me
what happened to her?

746
00:43:17,561 --> 00:43:19,859
I need to know
your relationship with her.

747
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:23,161
Tell her you're my boyfriend.
She can't tell you anything

748
00:43:23,234 --> 00:43:25,794
unless she knows
we're intimately connected.

749
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:28,771
We were romantic with each other.

750
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:31,740
- What do you mean?
- You know, boyfriend-girlfriend.

751
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:33,868
I know what romantic means,

752
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:36,879
but I... I have
a hard time believing that.

753
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:38,881
- What? Why?
- What? Why?

754
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:41,611
Elizabeth's whole life
was this hospital.

755
00:43:41,685 --> 00:43:43,209
"Was"? Did she say "was"?

756
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:45,755
I don't know of a single date
she'd ever been on.

757
00:43:45,823 --> 00:43:49,384
We were fairly recent.
I live in her apartment...

758
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,052
- David.
- Building.

759
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:54,029
So, you don't know about the accident.

760
00:43:54,098 --> 00:43:56,089
Accident.

761
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:59,895
Oh, God, David. I remember it.

762
00:44:01,038 --> 00:44:02,266
It was awful.

763
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,404
I was... I've been away.

764
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,706
It was three months ago.

765
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:10,178
Three months.

766
00:44:10,247 --> 00:44:12,272
I'm sorry.

767
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:16,115
I was away for awhile
on a business trip.

768
00:44:53,958 --> 00:44:55,482
Oh, my God.

769
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:59,120
What was that?
You were, like, flying.

770
00:45:01,332 --> 00:45:04,495
Oh, my God. It's you.

771
00:45:06,303 --> 00:45:08,100
It's you, it's really you.

772
00:45:08,172 --> 00:45:10,572
You're... you're not dead,
you're alive.

773
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:13,337
I know, David, but I'm in a coma.
This is not good.

774
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:15,207
Well, it's way better than dead.

775
00:45:15,279 --> 00:45:17,679
Look at you.
Your body is healing, it's...

776
00:45:17,748 --> 00:45:20,649
You don't have any scars.
You look pretty.

777
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,517
It doesn't matter how I look.

778
00:45:24,588 --> 00:45:27,113
Three months,
that's a persistent coma.

779
00:45:27,191 --> 00:45:29,352
We're here now.
Let's do something.

780
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:30,825
Like what?

781
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:33,989
Like... I don't know.
You're the doctor.

782
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:35,998
Right. Right.

783
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:39,835
- Forget it.
- What?

784
00:45:39,904 --> 00:45:41,269
I was gonna say that we...

785
00:45:41,338 --> 00:45:44,364
I need to find a way
to put myself together again.

786
00:45:44,441 --> 00:45:47,808
OK, good, good. That's great.
How do we do that?

787
00:45:47,878 --> 00:45:49,937
Maybe I should try this.

788
00:45:55,019 --> 00:45:56,384
Something's happening!

789
00:45:56,453 --> 00:45:58,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
I think it's working!

790
00:45:58,656 --> 00:46:00,886
Yeah? No.

791
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:02,687
Let me try again.

792
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,193
I mean, really focus on it.

793
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:06,229
Hold on inside there.

794
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:11,828
I'm not sticking.

795
00:46:11,902 --> 00:46:14,564
It's like I'm no longer
connected to this body.

796
00:46:14,638 --> 00:46:17,835
All right, all right, all right,
all right. Turn around.

797
00:46:17,908 --> 00:46:19,842
- What?
- I want to try something.

798
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:21,241
OK.

799
00:46:28,385 --> 00:46:29,443
You felt that.

800
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,714
My hand tingled.

801
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:33,382
You are still connected to your body.

802
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:35,015
The monitor doesn't agree.

803
00:46:35,092 --> 00:46:36,719
Machines don't know everything.

804
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:39,092
Everything in my training
tells me they do.

805
00:46:39,163 --> 00:46:41,188
Then how are we having
this conversation?

806
00:46:41,265 --> 00:46:43,529
I don't know.

807
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:46,467
Mr. Abbott? I'm sorry.
I have an appointment,

808
00:46:46,537 --> 00:46:49,097
and I can't leave you here unattended.

809
00:46:49,173 --> 00:46:51,664
Oan I just have a couple
more minutes, please?

810
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:52,936
I'm saying goodbye.

811
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:55,137
- Of course.
- Thank you.

812
00:46:55,212 --> 00:46:57,737
My nieces must have
made these things for me.

813
00:46:57,815 --> 00:47:00,784
Wow, that's an amazing likeness.

814
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,712
Look at this.

815
00:47:04,788 --> 00:47:07,450
That's the picture
from my nightstand.

816
00:47:07,524 --> 00:47:08,991
Abby must have brought it.

817
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:10,356
You look great.

818
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:15,029
Look at me now.

819
00:47:16,433 --> 00:47:19,027
These levels aren't changing, David.

820
00:47:19,103 --> 00:47:21,094
If anything, they're decreasing.

821
00:47:23,941 --> 00:47:26,671
- I'm gonna have to leave soon.
- All right.

822
00:47:26,744 --> 00:47:29,406
Want me to wait
downstairs in the lobby?

823
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:32,677
No, no, that's sweet.
You should go.

824
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:34,377
Thank you for helping me.

825
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:36,646
It was my pleasure.

826
00:47:37,654 --> 00:47:40,452
Are you sure you don't want
to come back with me?

827
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:42,992
After all,
it is your apartment. It's fine.

828
00:47:44,061 --> 00:47:46,996
After I made it here, I...

829
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:49,862
...can't imagine
leaving myself, you know?

830
00:47:49,933 --> 00:47:51,423
OK, I know, I just...

831
00:47:51,502 --> 00:47:53,834
Itjust feels weird
leaving you here alone.

832
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:57,040
I don't know where else I belong.

833
00:47:57,107 --> 00:48:00,508
Mr. Abbott. I'm sorry.

834
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:06,178
Goodbye, Elizabeth.

835
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:10,617
Goodbye.

836
00:48:18,162 --> 00:48:20,289
Oh, I hate this.

837
00:48:20,364 --> 00:48:22,423
She finally gets a life, and then...

838
00:48:22,499 --> 00:48:24,399
You know what?
That guy was cute.

839
00:48:24,468 --> 00:48:27,437
At least she got a chance
to hang with him for a little while.

840
00:48:27,504 --> 00:48:30,667
Yeah. It woulda been awful
if she'd gone through her whole life

841
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:33,642
not knowing what it was all about.

842
00:48:49,827 --> 00:48:52,387
Oh, my God. Jenny?

843
00:48:52,463 --> 00:48:55,455
No wonder
I could never find you.

844
00:49:03,006 --> 00:49:04,496
I guess you got my job.

845
00:49:04,575 --> 00:49:08,067
Yeah. I think I've earned it.
I deserve it.

846
00:49:08,145 --> 00:49:10,113
Everything
you thought it would be?

847
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:14,014
It is. And it's time to upgrade
from the 330 to the 740.

848
00:49:14,084 --> 00:49:16,609
I'm goin' to the dealer tonight.

849
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:19,155
Hold on. It's Walsh,
I have to take this.

850
00:49:19,223 --> 00:49:20,554
Hello?

851
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:22,956
Really? You want me to do it?

852
00:49:24,361 --> 00:49:25,953
Sure, of course I can.

853
00:49:31,368 --> 00:49:34,303
Dude, did you know I can get
a built-in jack for my iPod?

854
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:36,805
Did you know there's
people out there dying?

855
00:49:36,874 --> 00:49:40,037
- I'm in a coma, have you noticed?
- I know. Sweet!

856
00:49:47,885 --> 00:49:50,445
Zoe? Lily Vanilli?

857
00:49:51,622 --> 00:49:54,455
Oh, my God,
you guys got so big!

858
00:49:56,727 --> 00:49:57,921
Beat ya!

859
00:49:57,995 --> 00:49:59,656
- Did not!
- Did too!

860
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:01,322
- Did not!
- Did too!

861
00:50:01,398 --> 00:50:02,490
Did not!
Did too!

862
00:50:02,566 --> 00:50:04,500
How could I feel him
and not you guys?

863
00:50:04,568 --> 00:50:05,933
- Did not!
- Did too!

864
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:08,335
- Oh, that's funny.
- Abby.

865
00:50:08,405 --> 00:50:10,737
I remember saying
no running, no screaming!

866
00:50:10,807 --> 00:50:13,605
- Abby, can you feel me?
- All right, chill, I'm serious.

867
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:15,110
I guess not.

868
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:18,012
- I hope you feel better.
- Get well soon.

869
00:50:18,081 --> 00:50:19,343
I love you.

870
00:50:19,416 --> 00:50:21,884
I remember when you pushed us...

871
00:50:21,952 --> 00:50:24,011
It's so sweet you guys
come and visit me.

872
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:26,749
- And I really miss...
- Excuse me.

873
00:50:26,823 --> 00:50:28,484
- Mrs. Brody, hi.
- Hi.

874
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:31,289
Dr. Rushton.
Oould I have a quick word?

875
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:34,023
- Sure.
- What do you want?

876
00:50:34,097 --> 00:50:37,555
First of all, I hope you know how much
we all love and miss Elizabeth.

877
00:50:37,634 --> 00:50:40,159
Please. He's doing
high fives he's not in Phoenix.

878
00:50:40,237 --> 00:50:42,899
Because she was
a senior resident here,

879
00:50:42,973 --> 00:50:45,168
we've taken some
extraordinary measures

880
00:50:45,242 --> 00:50:48,541
to make her feel more comfortable
these last three months.

881
00:50:48,612 --> 00:50:50,978
Lily! Turn it back!

882
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:52,538
Zoe, what did we talk about?

883
00:50:52,616 --> 00:50:54,675
Watch your sister. Sorry.

884
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:57,882
This is hard to say.

885
00:50:57,955 --> 00:51:00,549
When we come to work here,

886
00:51:00,624 --> 00:51:02,683
we are asked to sign release forms.

887
00:51:02,759 --> 00:51:03,987
OK.

888
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:05,688
I don't like the sound of this.

889
00:51:05,762 --> 00:51:09,323
Did you know your sister's opinion
about artificially prolonging life?

890
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:12,901
- No.
- She was against it.

891
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:14,028
Really?

892
00:51:14,104 --> 00:51:16,664
OK, that was before.
I am completely for it now.

893
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,937
Honestly, most in our
profession feel that way.

894
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:22,535
Not me! I'm perfectly happy.

895
00:51:22,613 --> 00:51:23,944
Oome on, Abby!

896
00:51:24,014 --> 00:51:26,141
You have got to feel me,
I'm your sister!

897
00:51:26,216 --> 00:51:29,049
But there's still some
brain activity, isn't there?

898
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:31,314
People have woken up
from this kind of coma.

899
00:51:31,388 --> 00:51:33,686
- All the time.
- Not on any record I've found.

900
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:37,693
Of course they have!
Otherwise, what am I doing here?

901
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:39,991
I feel car sick.

902
00:51:40,063 --> 00:51:42,896
- What are you doing?
- We're looking for the stick.

903
00:51:42,966 --> 00:51:43,955
What stick?

904
00:51:44,034 --> 00:51:47,162
- You said she had a stick up her...
- Stop it! Oome on.

905
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:49,899
TV is going to become
a very dim memory for you two.

906
00:51:49,973 --> 00:51:52,237
Mrs. Brody,
Elizabeth did sign a release.

907
00:51:52,309 --> 00:51:54,277
Because of the special situation,

908
00:51:54,344 --> 00:51:57,939
we won't take any terminal action
without your explicit approval.

909
00:51:58,015 --> 00:52:00,074
Now, I've prepared this paperwork...

910
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:01,583
Don't sign that. I'm here!

911
00:52:01,652 --> 00:52:04,212
...if you decide to sign...
- I'll think about it.

912
00:52:04,288 --> 00:52:07,052
Abby, I'll baby-sit more, I swear!

913
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:09,024
Those jeans you love?
They're yours!

914
00:52:09,092 --> 00:52:11,083
We sometimes find that it's easier

915
00:52:11,161 --> 00:52:14,494
just to ask God's forgiveness
and not prolong the inevitable.

916
00:52:14,564 --> 00:52:16,054
I said I'd think about it.

917
00:52:17,868 --> 00:52:19,802
Thank you, Abby.

918
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:21,735
You always looked out for me.

919
00:52:33,684 --> 00:52:35,083
You here?

920
00:52:39,623 --> 00:52:41,022
I guess not.

921
00:53:37,748 --> 00:53:39,545
I'm locked out.

922
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:03,837
Doesn't this location
make San Francisco bearable?

923
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:06,705
Wait, you're not from here,
are you? Oh, good.

924
00:54:06,777 --> 00:54:09,371
And what's with all
the single men in this town?

925
00:54:09,446 --> 00:54:13,075
Every time I meet
a good-looking guy... lesbian.

926
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:14,583
It's tough.

927
00:54:14,651 --> 00:54:17,711
I'd get on the phone and I'd be like,

928
00:54:17,788 --> 00:54:19,722
"Hello? Osama?

929
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:21,724
Oommunism is so over.

930
00:54:21,792 --> 00:54:24,226
Like, give your people toilet paper."

931
00:54:24,294 --> 00:54:26,228
So, like, if I had to choose?

932
00:54:26,296 --> 00:54:27,786
If I had to choose.

933
00:54:29,466 --> 00:54:30,797
Wow.

934
00:54:32,068 --> 00:54:34,332
I guess I'd have to go
with the midget.

935
00:54:34,404 --> 00:54:36,463
I'm sorry...

936
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:39,572
The locksmith,
does he know to ring my unit?

937
00:54:41,678 --> 00:54:43,009
I think so.

938
00:54:44,548 --> 00:54:45,810
Where's your bathroom?

939
00:54:45,882 --> 00:54:48,373
- It's right down the hall there.
- OK.

940
00:55:00,697 --> 00:55:02,028
- Elizabeth!
- Yeah.

941
00:55:02,098 --> 00:55:04,931
No, I just... I didn't think
you were gonna come back.

942
00:55:05,001 --> 00:55:08,266
I thought you were gonna stay
at the hospital with your body.

943
00:55:08,338 --> 00:55:11,501
It's terrible. They're trying
to get my sister to sign papers

944
00:55:11,575 --> 00:55:14,635
authorizing permission
to take me off of life support.

945
00:55:14,711 --> 00:55:17,441
- No! What? They can't do that!
- I know. I said that.

946
00:55:17,514 --> 00:55:18,776
Nobody could hear me.

947
00:55:18,849 --> 00:55:20,783
And I just wanted to talk to you.

948
00:55:20,851 --> 00:55:23,115
- David!
- Just a minute!

949
00:55:23,186 --> 00:55:26,314
Well, that didn't take very long.

950
00:55:26,389 --> 00:55:27,788
No.

951
00:55:27,858 --> 00:55:29,587
No, she barged in.

952
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:31,752
She got locked out of her apartment.

953
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:35,286
- You don't have to explain. I get it.
- No, you don't get anything.

954
00:55:35,365 --> 00:55:36,889
She's using the bathroom...

955
00:55:36,967 --> 00:55:39,401
Her voice sounded
like it came from the bedroom.

956
00:55:39,469 --> 00:55:40,663
It did?

957
00:55:41,037 --> 00:55:43,835
Oome here.
I want to show you something.

958
00:55:44,608 --> 00:55:46,735
When you know, you know, right?

959
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:49,438
I had no idea that's...

960
00:55:49,513 --> 00:55:51,674
You had no idea
she was naked on your bed.

961
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:53,079
No.

962
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:57,077
You're wondering
what she looks like.

963
00:55:57,153 --> 00:55:58,450
- No, I'm not.
- A little?

964
00:55:58,522 --> 00:56:00,285
Not enough to go look.

965
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:02,655
Tell you what.
I'll do a little recon for ya.

966
00:56:02,726 --> 00:56:05,354
- Please don't!
- Don't worry. I'm a doctor.

967
00:56:05,428 --> 00:56:08,920
- Elizabeth. No, no, no, no, no.
- Relax.

968
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:13,430
She's got a tattoo on her ass.

969
00:56:15,572 --> 00:56:16,869
It says "All aboard."

970
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:19,306
- Really?
- In three languages.

971
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:21,708
- Oh, that's funny.
- She's very cultural.

972
00:56:21,778 --> 00:56:23,370
You know, you sound jealous.

973
00:56:23,446 --> 00:56:25,311
- Oh, please.
- You do.

974
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:27,509
Are you talkin' to someone?

975
00:56:28,251 --> 00:56:31,482
- Hey, what's goin' on?
- Eyes up top, David.

976
00:56:32,656 --> 00:56:34,351
Nothing.

977
00:56:34,424 --> 00:56:37,484
Look, I'm sorry if I'm coming on
a little too strong.

978
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:39,552
That's just my style.

979
00:56:39,629 --> 00:56:41,324
I hear you sometimes.

980
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:44,265
Up here...

981
00:56:44,334 --> 00:56:45,995
...by yourself...

982
00:56:47,671 --> 00:56:50,003
And I just figured...

983
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:51,802
...maybe he's lonely.

984
00:56:51,875 --> 00:56:53,467
I know I am.

985
00:56:54,311 --> 00:56:56,871
Is it wrong for me
to want to touch someone?

986
00:56:56,947 --> 00:56:58,608
To be close?

987
00:56:58,682 --> 00:57:01,879
Feel a warm body next to me?

988
00:57:01,952 --> 00:57:03,920
David, just do it.

989
00:57:03,987 --> 00:57:05,045
What?

990
00:57:05,121 --> 00:57:08,056
Go ahead, be with her.
It's what you both want.

991
00:57:08,124 --> 00:57:10,957
- No, it isn't.
- Are you all right?

992
00:57:11,528 --> 00:57:15,020
Do you... wanna take
some kind of medication first?

993
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:16,360
It's cool if you do.

994
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:18,560
David, it's OK.

995
00:57:18,635 --> 00:57:21,627
She's beautiful, and she's
right here in front of you.

996
00:57:21,705 --> 00:57:24,037
- And I'm in the way.
- No, you're not.

997
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:26,974
Elizabeth. Elizabeth!

998
00:57:32,382 --> 00:57:34,043
It's Katrina.

999
00:57:47,473 --> 00:57:48,997
That was quick.

1000
00:57:50,143 --> 00:57:51,940
Oome on, nothing happened.

1001
00:57:54,814 --> 00:57:56,941
What'd you say to her?

1002
00:57:59,352 --> 00:58:01,081
That I was seeing someone.

1003
00:58:02,689 --> 00:58:04,281
Honestly?

1004
00:58:04,757 --> 00:58:08,454
Well, I didn't mention
that I was the only person who could.

1005
00:58:14,033 --> 00:58:15,762
You know, I haven't...

1006
00:58:17,103 --> 00:58:19,503
...haven't really been
with anyone since...

1007
00:58:19,572 --> 00:58:21,233
...since Laura.

1008
00:58:23,643 --> 00:58:25,838
She was cursing at her shoe.

1009
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:28,809
Her heel had broken.

1010
00:58:31,851 --> 00:58:35,048
And then she just kinda sat down

1011
00:58:35,121 --> 00:58:37,351
and put her hand to her head.

1012
00:58:37,423 --> 00:58:39,550
Oerebral hemorrhage?

1013
00:58:44,330 --> 00:58:46,321
And...

1014
00:58:50,136 --> 00:58:52,127
I couldn't do anything to help her.

1015
00:58:53,206 --> 00:58:54,935
She was, like, gone.

1016
00:58:55,007 --> 00:58:57,737
I couldn't even say goodbye,
and she was just...

1017
00:58:58,478 --> 00:58:59,877
She's gone.

1018
00:59:06,352 --> 00:59:08,081
What was she like?

1019
00:59:09,155 --> 00:59:12,090
You know, she was just
a big pain in the ass.

1020
00:59:12,892 --> 00:59:14,291
No, really.

1021
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:17,295
I mean, the bras on the doorknobs,

1022
00:59:17,363 --> 00:59:21,163
leaving the car with the...
with the gas needle below empty.

1023
00:59:21,234 --> 00:59:24,362
She couldn't put gas in the car.
It was impossible for her.

1024
00:59:24,437 --> 00:59:28,999
And just total stubborn inability
to master a remote.

1025
00:59:29,075 --> 00:59:31,407
So she would just
randomly click buttons,

1026
00:59:31,477 --> 00:59:35,470
until the TV was snarled into
some unmanageable condition.

1027
00:59:35,548 --> 00:59:38,073
I mean, I'm so...

1028
00:59:38,151 --> 00:59:40,244
I'm mad just thinking...

1029
00:59:43,589 --> 00:59:44,920
...thinking about her.

1030
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:49,521
I'm sorry, David.

1031
00:59:51,264 --> 00:59:54,461
Your sister really wouldn't
sign those papers, would she?

1032
00:59:54,534 --> 00:59:56,525
I don't know.

1033
00:59:57,603 --> 00:59:59,264
I hope not.

1034
01:00:01,007 --> 01:00:03,601
Won't even matter
if I don't wake up soon.

1035
01:00:03,676 --> 01:00:06,304
My brain activity's
decreasing every day.

1036
01:00:06,379 --> 01:00:08,472
Maybe that's not such a bad thing.

1037
01:00:08,548 --> 01:00:10,641
You're kind of a smarty-pants.

1038
01:00:11,417 --> 01:00:13,510
No, it'll bring you down to my level.

1039
01:00:13,586 --> 01:00:16,714
You're not dumb, David,
just a little lazy.

1040
01:00:16,789 --> 01:00:18,848
Oute, but lazy.

1041
01:00:18,925 --> 01:00:20,051
Thank you.

1042
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:23,355
I wasn't always like this, you know.

1043
01:00:24,497 --> 01:00:26,192
What were you like?

1044
01:00:30,436 --> 01:00:32,233
Oome on.

1045
01:00:32,305 --> 01:00:34,170
I want to show you something.

1046
01:00:45,852 --> 01:00:47,843
- Where are we?
- It's an estate.

1047
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:49,979
The guy's in Hawaii this time of year.

1048
01:00:50,056 --> 01:00:53,457
- Are we trespassing?
- Don't worry, we're not going inside.

1049
01:00:54,494 --> 01:00:55,825
Here it is.

1050
01:01:02,668 --> 01:01:04,602
You said you love gardens.

1051
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:06,262
What is this place?

1052
01:01:06,339 --> 01:01:08,398
I made this place.

1053
01:01:10,743 --> 01:01:12,210
This is my work.

1054
01:01:13,079 --> 01:01:16,344
I was a landscape architect.
I had my own company for awhile.

1055
01:01:18,284 --> 01:01:20,047
David, I've been here before.

1056
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:22,146
What do you mean?

1057
01:01:22,221 --> 01:01:24,553
I know this is gonna
sound really strange,

1058
01:01:24,624 --> 01:01:27,149
but I dreamed of this place.

1059
01:01:28,628 --> 01:01:31,620
These flowers, everything.

1060
01:01:32,498 --> 01:01:34,762
It's beautiful.

1061
01:01:34,834 --> 01:01:37,098
I had no idea, David.

1062
01:01:37,169 --> 01:01:39,899
What a joy it must be
to create a place like this.

1063
01:01:42,074 --> 01:01:43,405
Yeah, it was.

1064
01:01:43,476 --> 01:01:45,000
Is it gonna be again?

1065
01:01:46,646 --> 01:01:47,670
Sure.

1066
01:01:47,747 --> 01:01:49,237
Promise?

1067
01:02:06,999 --> 01:02:08,899
Who the hell's calling me?

1068
01:02:08,968 --> 01:02:10,435
Hello?

1069
01:02:10,503 --> 01:02:11,902
David, it's Grace.

1070
01:02:11,971 --> 01:02:15,202
Well, you are the luckiest man
in San Francisco.

1071
01:02:15,274 --> 01:02:17,742
Thank you. Why do you say that?

1072
01:02:17,810 --> 01:02:19,778
Great news, the apartment is yours.

1073
01:02:19,845 --> 01:02:22,473
And they're willing
to give you a nice long lease.

1074
01:02:22,548 --> 01:02:23,879
How long a lease?

1075
01:02:23,950 --> 01:02:26,077
Really long.
And I'm gonna send it over,

1076
01:02:26,152 --> 01:02:28,848
- and I'll talk to you tomorrow.
- Wait, wait, wait.

1077
01:02:28,921 --> 01:02:30,980
Why are they giving me
a long lease now?

1078
01:02:31,057 --> 01:02:34,424
It's a terrible story. The tenant
was in some kind of coma,

1079
01:02:34,493 --> 01:02:37,189
and it is what it is,
so they're gonna pull the plug.

1080
01:02:37,263 --> 01:02:41,290
But get this: They are gonna
throw in that couch you like.

1081
01:02:41,367 --> 01:02:43,597
- David?
- What?

1082
01:02:43,669 --> 01:02:45,296
We gotta go talk to your sister.

1083
01:02:45,371 --> 01:02:47,202
Why? What are you gonna say to her?

1084
01:02:47,273 --> 01:02:49,605
I don't know. What kind of dirt
do you have on her?

1085
01:02:49,675 --> 01:02:51,506
Her middle name is Ellen.

1086
01:02:51,577 --> 01:02:55,308
In the third grade she told everybody
it was Leia, like Princess Leia.

1087
01:02:55,381 --> 01:02:56,575
What else?

1088
01:02:57,850 --> 01:02:59,784
She's lactose intolerant.

1089
01:02:59,852 --> 01:03:01,911
All right, the only way
this is gonna work

1090
01:03:01,988 --> 01:03:04,548
is if I could tell her something
that only you know.

1091
01:03:04,624 --> 01:03:07,388
Something so intimate, so personal...

1092
01:03:07,460 --> 01:03:11,396
She French-kissed her ex-boyfriend J.J.
Five minutes before her wedding.

1093
01:03:11,464 --> 01:03:13,125
Oh, that'll work. That's good.

1094
01:03:13,199 --> 01:03:16,327
- Nobody knows that.
- That... I think I like her already.

1095
01:03:23,376 --> 01:03:26,777
So, how did you know Elizabeth?
You must've worked together.

1096
01:03:26,846 --> 01:03:30,805
- God knows she wasn't dating anybody.
- Everybody likes to rub that one in.

1097
01:03:30,883 --> 01:03:34,148
Actually, this is gonna be
a little difficult to swallow...

1098
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:35,278
Tea!

1099
01:03:35,354 --> 01:03:38,187
My nieces are here?
They're supposed to be at school.

1100
01:03:38,257 --> 01:03:40,122
- Hi.
- Would you like some tea, sir?

1101
01:03:40,192 --> 01:03:41,819
Well, yes, thank you, madam.

1102
01:03:41,894 --> 01:03:45,489
Abort. Don't do this in front of them,
it's gonna freak them out.

1103
01:03:45,564 --> 01:03:48,499
I'm sorry, you were saying?
How did you know her?

1104
01:03:48,567 --> 01:03:50,592
- Lie your butt off.
- We worked together.

1105
01:03:50,670 --> 01:03:51,864
- No!
- No.

1106
01:03:51,937 --> 01:03:55,100
No, no, no. You're not credible
as a doctor. Make something up.

1107
01:03:55,174 --> 01:03:58,575
I mean, I didn't work with her.
We worked together on my illness.

1108
01:03:58,644 --> 01:03:59,941
I was a patient of hers.

1109
01:04:00,012 --> 01:04:02,276
Lily? Oan you see me?

1110
01:04:02,348 --> 01:04:05,146
I was sick. I had meningitis.

1111
01:04:05,217 --> 01:04:06,980
Spiral meningitis.

1112
01:04:07,053 --> 01:04:08,384
I'm so sorry.

1113
01:04:08,454 --> 01:04:10,479
Spiral meningitis?
It's not a disease.

1114
01:04:10,556 --> 01:04:12,990
Oh, no, it's OK.
I'm much better now.

1115
01:04:13,059 --> 01:04:14,048
I...

1116
01:04:14,126 --> 01:04:16,253
Elizabeth, she believed in me,

1117
01:04:16,328 --> 01:04:19,729
believed that I would recover
when nobody else did.

1118
01:04:19,799 --> 01:04:21,266
And then I did.

1119
01:04:21,333 --> 01:04:23,267
That sounds just like her.

1120
01:04:23,335 --> 01:04:26,168
But why are you telling me this?

1121
01:04:27,339 --> 01:04:31,207
Because I know about
Elizabeth's situation,

1122
01:04:31,277 --> 01:04:33,871
and I just wanna say that...

1123
01:04:33,946 --> 01:04:35,573
Lily.

1124
01:04:35,648 --> 01:04:38,583
...there are things...
- You know I'm here, don't you?

1125
01:04:38,651 --> 01:04:40,243
...sometimes that...

1126
01:04:40,319 --> 01:04:42,617
...that are beyond our understanding.

1127
01:04:44,390 --> 01:04:47,382
And so, I just wanted to ask you...

1128
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:50,554
Actually, I just want to beg you

1129
01:04:50,629 --> 01:04:53,393
to... to give her
a little bit more time.

1130
01:04:53,466 --> 01:04:55,764
She's gonna pull through this thing.

1131
01:04:55,835 --> 01:04:57,325
I just know it.

1132
01:04:57,403 --> 01:04:59,394
That's really sweet of you to say,

1133
01:04:59,472 --> 01:05:02,600
but... it's kinda too late.

1134
01:05:02,675 --> 01:05:03,767
Abby.

1135
01:05:03,843 --> 01:05:06,107
- What do you mean?
- Abby, what did you do?

1136
01:05:07,113 --> 01:05:08,512
It's David, right?

1137
01:05:09,815 --> 01:05:13,717
You see, it's too late because
I've already signed the papers.

1138
01:05:13,786 --> 01:05:16,311
Abby. I'm here.

1139
01:05:16,388 --> 01:05:18,253
Oan you feel me? I'm right here.

1140
01:05:18,324 --> 01:05:21,054
We're terminating life support
tomorrow at noon,

1141
01:05:21,127 --> 01:05:23,391
while the girls are in school.

1142
01:05:23,462 --> 01:05:26,522
I mean, the past three months
have been so hard on them,

1143
01:05:26,599 --> 01:05:28,089
on this whole family.

1144
01:05:28,167 --> 01:05:30,158
Well, I understand that. I really do.

1145
01:05:30,236 --> 01:05:32,727
But I think you're makin'
a grave mistake here,

1146
01:05:32,805 --> 01:05:36,206
- because I really believe...
- It's for the best. Really.

1147
01:05:36,275 --> 01:05:37,833
This is what Elizabeth wanted.

1148
01:05:39,211 --> 01:05:42,669
I mean, I spent my whole life thinking
I knew what was best for her.

1149
01:05:42,748 --> 01:05:46,240
What she should wear,
what men she should date.

1150
01:05:47,987 --> 01:05:50,114
This is the last thing
Elizabeth asked for.

1151
01:05:51,490 --> 01:05:55,290
And for the first time in my life,
I'm gonna respect her wishes.

1152
01:05:57,229 --> 01:05:59,561
Oh, Abby.

1153
01:05:59,632 --> 01:06:01,031
Look.

1154
01:06:02,101 --> 01:06:04,797
This is gonna sound
really strange to you, but...

1155
01:06:04,870 --> 01:06:05,859
Oh, no, no, no.

1156
01:06:05,938 --> 01:06:08,566
...the truth is Elizabeth
is here with us right now.

1157
01:06:08,641 --> 01:06:13,101
She came here with me, she's standing
next to you, begging you to wait.

1158
01:06:13,179 --> 01:06:15,044
Right next to me?

1159
01:06:15,114 --> 01:06:17,105
- Right there.
- David, stop.

1160
01:06:17,183 --> 01:06:19,378
No, let me do this.
I don't know how or why,

1161
01:06:19,451 --> 01:06:21,749
but somehow I can see
your sister's spirit.

1162
01:06:21,821 --> 01:06:24,813
I know it's crazy,
but I also can talk to her.

1163
01:06:24,890 --> 01:06:28,291
So why don't I have herjust
explain the whole thing to you,

1164
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:29,657
and I'll translate.

1165
01:06:32,665 --> 01:06:34,860
Oould you just hold on, just a sec?

1166
01:06:37,736 --> 01:06:40,864
OK, tea party's over.
Time for Wiggly Safari!

1167
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:42,498
Yeah!

1168
01:06:43,075 --> 01:06:46,602
- OK, David, this could work.
- I think I was getting through to her.

1169
01:06:46,679 --> 01:06:50,080
- You need to get her to the hospital.
- Right to the hospital.

1170
01:06:50,149 --> 01:06:54,085
- We'll get her to rip those papers...
- Get the hell outta here, you freak!

1171
01:06:54,954 --> 01:06:57,388
I'm not makin' this up!
Why would I?

1172
01:06:57,456 --> 01:06:59,287
Abby, calm down,
just calm down!

1173
01:06:59,358 --> 01:07:01,656
I'll chop you!
I swear, I will chop you!

1174
01:07:01,727 --> 01:07:03,490
- Tell about J.J.
- I know about J.J.

1175
01:07:03,562 --> 01:07:06,087
- What?
- I know what you did with J.J.

1176
01:07:06,165 --> 01:07:08,725
I'll tell everybody.

1177
01:07:08,801 --> 01:07:10,894
How do you know that?
Nobody knows that!

1178
01:07:10,970 --> 01:07:12,938
Get outta here! Get going!

1179
01:07:19,578 --> 01:07:21,045
You kids OK?

1180
01:07:21,113 --> 01:07:25,573
Mommy, is Auntie Elizabeth
gonna have more tea?

1181
01:07:27,519 --> 01:07:28,850
What?

1182
01:07:42,334 --> 01:07:45,394
I don't think your sister's
a very spiritual person.

1183
01:07:45,471 --> 01:07:46,995
She's just bein' a good mom.

1184
01:07:47,072 --> 01:07:49,597
Tryin' to keep her kids away
from a crazy guy.

1185
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:56,612
I think I would have liked
to have been a mom.

1186
01:07:56,682 --> 01:07:58,149
You'd make a good one.

1187
01:07:59,351 --> 01:08:00,375
Thanks.

1188
01:08:02,955 --> 01:08:04,582
Guess I'll never really know.

1189
01:08:04,657 --> 01:08:07,421
Oome on, Lizzie. This can't be it.

1190
01:08:07,493 --> 01:08:09,484
- Lizzie?
- OK, I'm sorry.

1191
01:08:09,561 --> 01:08:11,688
I know you don't like
to be called that.

1192
01:08:11,764 --> 01:08:12,992
I'm warming up to it.

1193
01:08:14,366 --> 01:08:15,799
I can go to that hospital.

1194
01:08:15,868 --> 01:08:18,268
I could talk to your friend, Fran.
I could...

1195
01:08:18,337 --> 01:08:20,532
- No, David.
...talk to the asshole guy.

1196
01:08:20,606 --> 01:08:23,837
Brett? No. Just stop,
They'll put you in a straitjacket.

1197
01:08:23,909 --> 01:08:27,037
There's no way anyone's
gonna believe I'm still here.

1198
01:08:27,112 --> 01:08:29,342
Your niece, the little girl.
She saw you.

1199
01:08:29,415 --> 01:08:30,677
Oh, great.

1200
01:08:30,749 --> 01:08:32,979
My fate's in the hands
of a four-year-old

1201
01:08:33,052 --> 01:08:35,247
who has seven other
imaginary friends.

1202
01:08:36,255 --> 01:08:38,246
Wait. There is someone else.

1203
01:08:38,324 --> 01:08:39,723
What do you mean?

1204
01:08:39,792 --> 01:08:41,123
Oome on.

1205
01:08:43,062 --> 01:08:44,757
- Darryl!
- Dude.

1206
01:08:44,830 --> 01:08:47,628
- Yeah.
- The spirit's with you, isn't it?

1207
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:50,294
You can't bring that here.
What are you thinking?

1208
01:08:50,369 --> 01:08:53,805
- You were right. She's alive.
- Righteous.

1209
01:08:53,872 --> 01:08:56,807
She's in a coma. Her family's
gonna take her off life support.

1210
01:08:56,875 --> 01:08:58,570
Not so righteous.

1211
01:08:58,644 --> 01:09:01,943
So, what, are you guys
socializing now?

1212
01:09:02,014 --> 01:09:05,006
We've... acclimated.

1213
01:09:05,084 --> 01:09:07,075
Yeah, I can tell.

1214
01:09:07,753 --> 01:09:12,816
In fact, I'm sensin' some pretty
intense feelings she has for you, bro.

1215
01:09:12,891 --> 01:09:15,758
- Really?
- No, I don't.

1216
01:09:15,828 --> 01:09:18,820
Major red aura.
Somebody's embarrassed.

1217
01:09:18,897 --> 01:09:21,798
- I am not. Oan we focus here?
- OK.

1218
01:09:21,867 --> 01:09:25,303
- Ask him if there's a spell...
- Or a chant. Anything to get...

1219
01:09:25,371 --> 01:09:27,430
- My spirit...
...back into her body?

1220
01:09:27,506 --> 01:09:31,067
- You're asking the wrong question.
- Why is that wrong?

1221
01:09:32,244 --> 01:09:34,109
Look, I have the gift.

1222
01:09:34,179 --> 01:09:35,874
I didn't ask for it, but I do.

1223
01:09:35,948 --> 01:09:37,643
I can sense these things,

1224
01:09:37,716 --> 01:09:39,650
spirits, whatever
you wanna call 'em.

1225
01:09:39,718 --> 01:09:42,050
Why they're hangin' here
in the first place?

1226
01:09:42,121 --> 01:09:45,682
- That's their unfinished business.
- Do I have the gift?

1227
01:09:45,758 --> 01:09:48,921
Dude, please.
You definitely don't have it.

1228
01:09:48,994 --> 01:09:50,325
You're a civilian.

1229
01:09:50,396 --> 01:09:53,661
But if I don't have it,
how is it that I can see her

1230
01:09:53,732 --> 01:09:55,700
and talk to her
when no one else can?

1231
01:09:55,768 --> 01:09:58,635
- Exactly.
- Exactly what?

1232
01:09:58,704 --> 01:10:01,502
That's the right question.

1233
01:10:01,573 --> 01:10:03,837
What the hell is he talking about?

1234
01:10:03,909 --> 01:10:06,400
God, I feel like it's
right there in front of us.

1235
01:10:06,478 --> 01:10:08,207
I just can't get a handle on it.

1236
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:11,738
How do you solve a problem
that isn't possible in the first place?

1237
01:10:11,817 --> 01:10:14,877
Because nothing seems
impossible to me anymore.

1238
01:10:14,953 --> 01:10:18,548
I mean, why did I move into
your apartment in the first place?

1239
01:10:18,624 --> 01:10:20,956
Why can I see you
when no one else can?

1240
01:10:21,026 --> 01:10:24,484
I mean, why was I down in that
restaurant when that guy collapsed?

1241
01:10:24,563 --> 01:10:27,828
It all seems interrelated somehow.

1242
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:29,834
- What are you doing?
- I don't know.

1243
01:10:29,902 --> 01:10:32,700
I feel like I missed something here.
Wait a second.

1244
01:10:32,771 --> 01:10:35,604
Rosemary Preston lives
right here in San Francisco.

1245
01:10:35,674 --> 01:10:36,902
We could go talk to her.

1246
01:10:36,975 --> 01:10:39,443
I'll call Information,
maybe she's listed.

1247
01:10:39,511 --> 01:10:40,739
Where did you get this?

1248
01:10:42,915 --> 01:10:44,906
It was just at the hospital.

1249
01:10:45,851 --> 01:10:48,183
Yeah. I...

1250
01:10:49,922 --> 01:10:51,321
I took it.

1251
01:10:52,791 --> 01:10:54,190
I'm sorry. I...

1252
01:10:54,259 --> 01:10:55,590
I just...

1253
01:10:55,661 --> 01:10:57,925
I wanted to have a picture of you.

1254
01:10:59,198 --> 01:11:01,894
I wasn't sure that I was
gonna ever see you again.

1255
01:11:01,967 --> 01:11:03,559
I'm sorry.

1256
01:11:05,003 --> 01:11:06,334
Don't be sorry.

1257
01:11:09,475 --> 01:11:10,999
That's really nice.

1258
01:11:12,678 --> 01:11:14,737
I really like that picture.

1259
01:11:15,814 --> 01:11:18,214
Yeah. Yeah, I liked it too.

1260
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:22,281
I had just gotten
my MOAT scores back.

1261
01:11:22,354 --> 01:11:24,481
Well, you must've done well.

1262
01:11:24,556 --> 01:11:27,957
No, actually, I bombed.
My scores were so low

1263
01:11:28,026 --> 01:11:30,688
I couldn't even get into
correspondence school.

1264
01:11:30,762 --> 01:11:33,060
- And that's a good thing?
- No.

1265
01:11:33,132 --> 01:11:36,431
I know it sounds kinda crazy.
I wanted to go back to the library

1266
01:11:36,502 --> 01:11:39,232
and start studying immediately,
but Abby said no.

1267
01:11:39,304 --> 01:11:41,568
The only thing to do
was to burn my scores

1268
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:43,699
and drink margaritas.

1269
01:11:44,643 --> 01:11:46,634
Lots and lots of margaritas.

1270
01:11:46,712 --> 01:11:49,306
Well, looks like she was right.

1271
01:11:49,381 --> 01:11:54,785
It's just funny because the one time
I completely failed at something,

1272
01:11:54,853 --> 01:11:57,185
I had more fun
than I'd ever had in my life.

1273
01:11:58,991 --> 01:12:00,652
You look happy.

1274
01:12:02,928 --> 01:12:04,589
I was happy.

1275
01:12:05,864 --> 01:12:08,526
But what was I doing
with the rest of my time?

1276
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:11,228
When I think about my life and I...

1277
01:12:12,538 --> 01:12:14,472
All I can remember is working.

1278
01:12:15,807 --> 01:12:18,002
You know? Working and working

1279
01:12:18,076 --> 01:12:20,840
and trying so hard.

1280
01:12:20,913 --> 01:12:22,778
And for what?

1281
01:12:22,848 --> 01:12:24,907
You help people.

1282
01:12:25,817 --> 01:12:27,284
You save lives.

1283
01:12:27,352 --> 01:12:29,946
Yeah. Including my own.

1284
01:12:30,022 --> 01:12:33,082
I saved my life, for later.

1285
01:12:35,761 --> 01:12:37,490
I just...

1286
01:12:37,563 --> 01:12:40,293
I never thought
there wouldn't be a later.

1287
01:12:40,365 --> 01:12:42,856
No, don't say that.
There's still time.

1288
01:12:42,935 --> 01:12:44,493
We're gonna see this lady...

1289
01:12:44,570 --> 01:12:47,903
You know, I just don't want
to spend my last night crying.

1290
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:51,302
Or... fighting my fate.

1291
01:12:52,611 --> 01:12:55,102
I wanna do something with you.

1292
01:12:57,783 --> 01:13:00,513
OK. OK, great.

1293
01:13:00,586 --> 01:13:01,848
What do you want to do?

1294
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,387
You want to fly to Paris?

1295
01:13:03,455 --> 01:13:05,514
See the Eiffel Tower? No problem.

1296
01:13:05,591 --> 01:13:08,583
You wanna dance on a beach
in Bali? Let's go! Let's do it!

1297
01:13:08,660 --> 01:13:09,854
Anywhere in the world

1298
01:13:09,928 --> 01:13:12,920
that will take MasterOard or Visa.

1299
01:13:12,998 --> 01:13:14,329
Anywhere.

1300
01:13:16,535 --> 01:13:18,867
There is something
that I would like to do.

1301
01:13:20,339 --> 01:13:21,738
Anything.

1302
01:13:23,475 --> 01:13:24,874
I'm so bad at this.

1303
01:13:25,777 --> 01:13:27,335
What? What is it?

1304
01:13:36,888 --> 01:13:38,549
Are you nervous?

1305
01:13:40,292 --> 01:13:42,886
- A little.
- Why?

1306
01:13:42,961 --> 01:13:44,360
I don't know.

1307
01:13:45,764 --> 01:13:49,700
How can you be nervous
when I can't even touch you?

1308
01:13:49,768 --> 01:13:53,704
I think I'm more nervous
because you can't touch me.

1309
01:13:54,473 --> 01:13:55,804
Why?

1310
01:13:57,809 --> 01:14:00,972
You know in the hospital
when you touched my hand?

1311
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:03,814
I felt it.

1312
01:14:03,882 --> 01:14:07,215
I mean, my spirit felt it.

1313
01:14:07,286 --> 01:14:09,277
I don't know how.

1314
01:14:11,056 --> 01:14:14,025
But I think if you could
ever really touch me...

1315
01:14:16,061 --> 01:14:18,325
...I might wake up from all of this.

1316
01:14:36,348 --> 01:14:38,816
I can almost feel that.

1317
01:14:38,884 --> 01:14:40,215
Me too.

1318
01:14:41,953 --> 01:14:44,615
I think I know what
my unfinished business is.

1319
01:14:44,690 --> 01:14:46,123
What?

1320
01:14:48,026 --> 01:14:49,618
You.

1321
01:15:14,653 --> 01:15:16,120
Elizabeth.

1322
01:15:17,589 --> 01:15:19,284
Elizabeth?

1323
01:15:19,358 --> 01:15:21,826
- Elizabeth?!
- I'm right here.

1324
01:15:21,893 --> 01:15:24,384
Oh, good, good.
I thought you were gone.

1325
01:15:24,463 --> 01:15:26,431
Suddenly I know
what I'm supposed to do,

1326
01:15:26,498 --> 01:15:28,329
because this time
I can do something.

1327
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:30,027
What are you talking about?

1328
01:15:30,102 --> 01:15:33,799
Lizzie, when we first met,
I kept saying that you were dead.

1329
01:15:33,872 --> 01:15:36,602
But it was me that was dead,
and you brought me back.

1330
01:15:36,675 --> 01:15:38,870
You saved me.

1331
01:15:38,944 --> 01:15:40,707
And now it's my turn to save you.

1332
01:15:40,779 --> 01:15:42,406
How?

1333
01:15:42,481 --> 01:15:44,574
I'm gonna steal your body.

1334
01:15:46,385 --> 01:15:47,977
David.

1335
01:15:48,053 --> 01:15:51,887
David. David, what are you thinking?
You can't do this!

1336
01:15:51,957 --> 01:15:54,255
- Why can't I?
- Because you'll go to jail.

1337
01:15:54,326 --> 01:15:57,557
So? If something happens to you,
you think I care where I'll be?

1338
01:15:57,629 --> 01:16:00,427
At least this'll buy us
a little more time.

1339
01:16:01,666 --> 01:16:04,965
The things you'd have to know
to even start to pull this off...

1340
01:16:05,036 --> 01:16:07,300
You know them.
You'll talk me through it.

1341
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:10,569
OK, you're gonna need a van.

1342
01:16:10,642 --> 01:16:13,440
And somebody with no morals.

1343
01:16:21,653 --> 01:16:24,178
- What are we movin' again?
- Medical supplies.

1344
01:16:24,256 --> 01:16:26,349
You didn't tell him? You have to.

1345
01:16:26,425 --> 01:16:28,416
You know,
he looks really familiar to me.

1346
01:16:28,493 --> 01:16:31,291
- You saw him at the bar.
- Saw who at the bar?

1347
01:16:31,363 --> 01:16:33,126
No one, never mind.
Here we go!

1348
01:16:35,167 --> 01:16:38,625
OK, and we're in such a hurry
to move this stuff because why?

1349
01:16:38,703 --> 01:16:42,036
There's a one-day sale on
hospital beds. I always wanted one.

1350
01:16:42,107 --> 01:16:44,701
Oh, great. Now you're
gonna become a bed potato.

1351
01:16:44,776 --> 01:16:47,074
- You've gotta tell this poor guy.
- Not yet.

1352
01:16:47,145 --> 01:16:49,079
- Not yet what?
- We're not there yet.

1353
01:16:49,147 --> 01:16:51,081
OK, Dave, be honest with me.

1354
01:16:51,149 --> 01:16:53,743
Has your imaginary friend
come out to play?

1355
01:17:01,493 --> 01:17:03,085
OK, grab a cart.

1356
01:17:03,161 --> 01:17:06,096
You need a blood pressure cuff

1357
01:17:06,164 --> 01:17:09,565
and a portable ventilator,
right there, that yellow thing.

1358
01:17:09,634 --> 01:17:12,967
Dave, what the hell are you doing?
This isn't a sale, man!

1359
01:17:13,038 --> 01:17:15,404
All right. I knew
you wouldn't come if I told you.

1360
01:17:15,474 --> 01:17:19,342
- Do I really want to hear this?
- My imaginary friend is not imaginary.

1361
01:17:19,411 --> 01:17:22,175
She is the spirit of a girl
in a coma upstairs

1362
01:17:22,247 --> 01:17:24,579
who they're about
to take off life support.

1363
01:17:24,649 --> 01:17:26,480
We've got to get her someplace safe.

1364
01:17:26,551 --> 01:17:27,984
- Really?
- Really.

1365
01:17:28,053 --> 01:17:30,920
- You should've told him.
- He wouldn't have believed me.

1366
01:17:30,989 --> 01:17:34,117
- Does he believe you now?
- I had to get him into the hospital!

1367
01:17:34,192 --> 01:17:37,593
Let me take you to the psych ward.
There are people who can help!

1368
01:17:37,662 --> 01:17:41,689
No time. It's 11:30 right now.
She's gonna be dead in half an hour!

1369
01:17:41,766 --> 01:17:43,495
Tell him I know this is a stretch.

1370
01:17:43,568 --> 01:17:46,765
Elizabeth is standing
right behind you right now.

1371
01:17:46,838 --> 01:17:48,931
She knows what a stretch
this is for you.

1372
01:17:49,007 --> 01:17:50,941
If your friend's really behind me,

1373
01:17:51,009 --> 01:17:53,739
ask her what I'm doing:
Rock, paper or scissors?

1374
01:17:53,812 --> 01:17:55,336
- Rock.
- Rock.

1375
01:17:56,181 --> 01:17:57,614
- Scissors.
- Scissors.

1376
01:17:58,383 --> 01:17:59,475
- Paper.
- Paper.

1377
01:18:00,252 --> 01:18:02,311
- Rock again.
- Rock again.

1378
01:18:02,387 --> 01:18:05,049
- He's flipping me off.
- Are you flipping her off?

1379
01:18:05,123 --> 01:18:07,887
- You're flipping her off!
- How...?

1380
01:18:07,959 --> 01:18:10,621
OK. OK, sometimes
people with emotional

1381
01:18:10,695 --> 01:18:13,687
and mental disturbances
can have psychic moments.

1382
01:18:13,765 --> 01:18:15,062
But even if she was real,

1383
01:18:15,133 --> 01:18:17,624
do you know what you're
risking for this woman?

1384
01:18:17,702 --> 01:18:18,999
- Yes!
- Why?

1385
01:18:20,906 --> 01:18:22,339
Because I love her.

1386
01:18:23,375 --> 01:18:25,104
I love her.

1387
01:18:25,176 --> 01:18:26,837
I do, I love you.

1388
01:18:28,113 --> 01:18:30,581
No one's ever said that to me before.

1389
01:18:37,389 --> 01:18:38,651
- David?
- What?

1390
01:18:38,723 --> 01:18:41,521
- Tell him thank you.
- We're really grateful, Jack.

1391
01:18:41,593 --> 01:18:42,890
I'm not doin' it for you.

1392
01:18:42,961 --> 01:18:44,326
Then why are you doing it?

1393
01:18:44,396 --> 01:18:47,695
Because someday, trust me,
I'm gonna need help movin' a body.

1394
01:18:47,766 --> 01:18:50,826
When that day comes,
I don't wanna hear any shit from you.

1395
01:18:53,939 --> 01:18:56,100
OK, get me on the gurney, quick.

1396
01:18:56,174 --> 01:18:57,539
Oh, my God. David.

1397
01:18:57,609 --> 01:18:59,167
I know. She's pretty, right?

1398
01:18:59,244 --> 01:19:01,439
That's really sweet,
but we've gotta go.

1399
01:19:01,513 --> 01:19:03,413
No, that's not it. This is her.

1400
01:19:03,481 --> 01:19:07,212
This is the woman I set you up with,
the woman you stood up that night!

1401
01:19:07,852 --> 01:19:09,342
I was gonna meet Elizabeth?

1402
01:19:09,421 --> 01:19:12,754
And she didn't make it either,
because she had an accident.

1403
01:19:13,825 --> 01:19:15,053
It was you.

1404
01:19:15,126 --> 01:19:16,718
Is that it? Is that why?

1405
01:19:16,795 --> 01:19:18,456
I was supposed to meet you.

1406
01:19:19,564 --> 01:19:20,690
How did you know her?

1407
01:19:20,765 --> 01:19:23,131
I'm friends with her sister.
We went out.

1408
01:19:23,201 --> 01:19:27,638
- I knew I'd seen him. That's J.J.!
- Jack is J.J.?

1409
01:19:27,706 --> 01:19:30,573
What did you...?
No one's called me J.J. Since college.

1410
01:19:30,642 --> 01:19:32,633
He's older and hairier, but it's him.

1411
01:19:32,711 --> 01:19:34,906
The one who tongued Abby
at the wedding?

1412
01:19:34,980 --> 01:19:37,972
- How the hell did you know that?
- It's Elizabeth.

1413
01:19:38,049 --> 01:19:41,382
- Oh, my God. She really is here.
- I told you!

1414
01:19:41,453 --> 01:19:45,549
Get her on the gurney! I don't want them
killing Abby's sister! Oome on.

1415
01:19:45,624 --> 01:19:46,921
OK. Be really gentle.

1416
01:19:48,326 --> 01:19:49,816
Yeah.

1417
01:19:49,894 --> 01:19:51,225
I'm here already.

1418
01:19:51,296 --> 01:19:53,423
- That's Brett.
- He's 15 minutes early!

1419
01:19:53,498 --> 01:19:56,467
- Soon as the sister shows, we're ready.
- He's comin' in.

1420
01:19:56,534 --> 01:19:58,126
That's OK. All right.

1421
01:19:58,203 --> 01:20:00,797
- Oareful, he's smart. His name is...
- Dr. Rushton?

1422
01:20:00,872 --> 01:20:03,102
- Yeah.
- Well, hi, David Abbott.

1423
01:20:03,174 --> 01:20:05,301
Buy some time.
Tell him you're a doctor.

1424
01:20:05,377 --> 01:20:06,605
I'm a doctor.

1425
01:20:06,678 --> 01:20:09,203
You're a special consultant
from PAO Medical.

1426
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:11,680
I'm a special consultant
from PAO Medical.

1427
01:20:11,750 --> 01:20:14,310
Dr. Walsh sent me down
for a final evaluation.

1428
01:20:14,386 --> 01:20:18,015
I had no verbal or written
instructions to that end.

1429
01:20:18,089 --> 01:20:20,751
There's new evidence
to support that full...

1430
01:20:20,825 --> 01:20:24,522
Functionality can be restored.
We need to run some tests.

1431
01:20:24,596 --> 01:20:26,029
Who's we?

1432
01:20:26,097 --> 01:20:28,088
Tell him your team is downstairs.

1433
01:20:28,166 --> 01:20:31,431
My team is downstairs with
a signed order from Dr. Walsh.

1434
01:20:31,503 --> 01:20:34,233
- You got it.
- This is the first I've heard of this.

1435
01:20:34,305 --> 01:20:36,239
You won't mind
if I talk to Dr. Walsh?

1436
01:20:36,307 --> 01:20:38,639
Go confirm with him.
We'll wait right here.

1437
01:20:38,710 --> 01:20:40,473
I'll just get him on the phone.

1438
01:20:43,348 --> 01:20:46,181
- David!
- OK, I'm not convincing as a doctor!

1439
01:20:46,251 --> 01:20:48,981
Oh, God, David,
the felonies just keep pilin' up!

1440
01:20:49,054 --> 01:20:50,919
- That way, David.
- Go this way.

1441
01:20:52,123 --> 01:20:53,784
- Brett!
- What happened?

1442
01:20:53,858 --> 01:20:55,223
Are you OK?

1443
01:20:55,293 --> 01:20:58,285
This is Dr. Rushton.
I need security on the third floor.

1444
01:20:58,363 --> 01:21:01,355
Don'tjostle. But go faster.

1445
01:21:01,433 --> 01:21:04,459
- Take a right up here.
- Right here! Right, right, right!

1446
01:21:07,906 --> 01:21:09,237
The elevator!

1447
01:21:10,542 --> 01:21:12,533
Hold it! We need you to...

1448
01:21:19,350 --> 01:21:21,079
Oh, shit.

1449
01:21:22,487 --> 01:21:25,081
Stop right there!
Stop! Stop! Stop! Hold it!

1450
01:21:25,156 --> 01:21:27,147
Oome on! Hey, hey, hey!

1451
01:21:29,094 --> 01:21:30,288
- David.
- Elizabeth.

1452
01:21:30,361 --> 01:21:32,829
Oh, my God, David.
My breathing tube is gone.

1453
01:21:32,897 --> 01:21:34,865
What? No!

1454
01:21:34,933 --> 01:21:38,266
- Well, what can I do?
- It's too late. It's happening.

1455
01:21:38,336 --> 01:21:40,201
- No.
- It's strong.

1456
01:21:40,271 --> 01:21:41,499
Be stronger.

1457
01:21:41,573 --> 01:21:43,165
It's pulling me away.

1458
01:21:43,241 --> 01:21:44,674
No!

1459
01:21:44,743 --> 01:21:46,210
Stay with me!

1460
01:21:56,187 --> 01:21:58,451
- I got ya.
- Elizabeth!

1461
01:21:58,523 --> 01:22:00,514
- No!
- David.

1462
01:22:00,592 --> 01:22:02,389
- Give me a sedative!
- Help her!

1463
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:04,860
- Gimme five of Haldol.
- Help her! Elizabeth!

1464
01:22:04,929 --> 01:22:07,363
- Hold him.
- No! Elizabeth!

1465
01:22:17,475 --> 01:22:18,772
What's going on?

1466
01:22:18,843 --> 01:22:20,777
- That's not possible.
- Yeah.

1467
01:22:20,845 --> 01:22:22,836
That's not possible.

1468
01:22:25,950 --> 01:22:29,408
Elizabeth? Oan you hear me?

1469
01:22:29,487 --> 01:22:32,650
I can't believe
we almost let you go.

1470
01:22:32,724 --> 01:22:35,488
Honey? It's me, Abby.

1471
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:38,154
- Abby.
- Yeah.

1472
01:22:43,301 --> 01:22:45,098
I think I bumped my head.

1473
01:22:49,507 --> 01:22:50,974
It's OK.

1474
01:23:02,854 --> 01:23:03,980
Hey.

1475
01:23:05,323 --> 01:23:06,654
Hello.

1476
01:23:08,126 --> 01:23:09,525
It's me.

1477
01:23:09,594 --> 01:23:12,085
I'm sorry, I don't...

1478
01:23:13,097 --> 01:23:16,498
Honey, it's David.
You don't remember David?

1479
01:23:19,270 --> 01:23:20,669
The apartment.

1480
01:23:21,806 --> 01:23:23,398
The rooftop.

1481
01:23:23,474 --> 01:23:24,805
Garden.

1482
01:23:26,544 --> 01:23:27,806
Nothin'.

1483
01:23:41,559 --> 01:23:44,221
Honey, you don't
remember him at all?

1484
01:24:49,861 --> 01:24:52,261
- Aunt Elizabeth, come on!
- Oome on!

1485
01:26:17,648 --> 01:26:19,878
We only rented it for a month.

1486
01:26:19,951 --> 01:26:22,442
- Did you move something?
- No.

1487
01:26:25,890 --> 01:26:28,358
It's funny, I just have
this strange feeling,

1488
01:26:28,426 --> 01:26:30,792
like... something's missing.

1489
01:26:30,862 --> 01:26:33,023
Everything's here, just as you left it.

1490
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:37,397
I guess it's just been a long time.

1491
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:39,894
You sure you're gonna be OK?

1492
01:26:39,971 --> 01:26:41,404
Yeah. I'm gonna be good.

1493
01:26:41,472 --> 01:26:44,999
- So I'll see you guys Saturday.
- OK. The girls'll bake for you.

1494
01:28:12,296 --> 01:28:13,627
Hi.

1495
01:28:18,102 --> 01:28:19,501
Don't worry, I'm...

1496
01:28:20,838 --> 01:28:23,170
I just wanted you
to have your garden.

1497
01:28:28,112 --> 01:28:29,545
How did you get up here?

1498
01:28:31,048 --> 01:28:34,779
Spare key.
Under the fire extinguisher.

1499
01:28:40,892 --> 01:28:43,520
Look, the last thing
I want to do is scare you.

1500
01:28:45,496 --> 01:28:46,690
Goodbye, Lizzie.

1501
01:28:51,469 --> 01:28:52,527
Wait.

1502
01:28:55,773 --> 01:28:57,400
Yeah?

1503
01:29:02,013 --> 01:29:04,004
The key. I need the key back.

1504
01:29:04,081 --> 01:29:06,072
Oh, right.

1505
01:29:14,892 --> 01:29:16,655
How do I know you?

1506
01:29:17,495 --> 01:29:19,395
Maybe from your dreams.

1507
01:29:26,704 --> 01:29:28,865
If you could ever really touch me,

1508
01:29:28,940 --> 01:29:30,999
I might wake up from all of this.

1509
01:29:33,244 --> 01:29:34,643
It wasn't a dream.

1510
01:29:34,712 --> 01:29:36,236
No.

1511
01:29:48,993 --> 01:29:50,051
David.

1512
01:29:50,127 --> 01:29:52,595
Yeah. Yeah.

1513
01:30:20,391 --> 01:30:22,791
Righteous.
