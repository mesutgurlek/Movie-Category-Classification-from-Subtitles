1
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:16,244
# Looking out a dirty, old window?

2
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:21,310
? Outside the cars in the city
go rushing by?

3
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:27,360
? I sit here alone, and I wonder why?

4
00:00:27,493 --> 00:00:30,394
? Friday night and everyone's moving?

5
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:31,953
? I can feel the heat?

6
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:33,658
? But it's soothing?

7
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:36,031
? Heading down?

8
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:39,697
? I search for the beat
in this dirty town?

9
00:00:39,772 --> 00:00:42,366
? Downtown, the young ones are going?

10
00:00:42,441 --> 00:00:45,410
? Downtown, the young ones are growing?

11
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:48,572
? We're the kids in America?

12
00:00:48,647 --> 00:00:51,844
? We're the kids in America??

13
00:00:51,917 --> 00:00:53,646
So, O.K., you're probably going,

14
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:56,483
Is this, like,
a Noxema commercial or what?

15
00:00:56,555 --> 00:00:57,920
But seriously,

16
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,925
I actually have a way normal life
for a teenage girl.

17
00:01:00,993 --> 00:01:03,257
I mean, I get up, I brush my teeth.

18
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:06,059
And I pick out my school clothes.

19
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,162
? They do it over there?

20
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,726
? But we don't do it here?

21
00:01:11,804 --> 00:01:14,796
? Ooh, bop?

22
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:16,933
? Fashion?

23
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:17,941
? Fashion?

24
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:18,942
? Turn to the left?

25
00:01:19,011 --> 00:01:19,943
? Fashion?

26
00:01:20,012 --> 00:01:21,639
? Turn to the right?

27
00:01:21,714 --> 00:01:24,012
? Ooh, fashion??

28
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:25,948
Daddy's a litigator.

29
00:01:26,018 --> 00:01:28,452
Those are the scariest kinds of lawyers.

30
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:31,456
Even Lucy, our maid,
is terrified of him.

31
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:33,458
And Daddy is so good,

32
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:35,153
he gets $500 an hour
to fight with people.

33
00:01:35,227 --> 00:01:36,956
He fights with me for free.

34
00:01:37,029 --> 00:01:38,462
Daddy!

35
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:40,465
Cher, please don't start
with the juice again.

36
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:41,966
Daddy, you need your Vitamin C.

37
00:01:42,034 --> 00:01:43,467
Where's my briefcase?

38
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:46,471
It's been a couple months now.
Let's go to Malibu.

39
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:47,972
Don't tell me those lowlifes

40
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,473
have been calling again.

41
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:50,975
They are your parents.

42
00:01:51,043 --> 00:01:52,977
Don't sneak out of the office.

43
00:01:53,045 --> 00:01:54,979
Dr. Lovett's giving you a flu shot.

44
00:01:55,047 --> 00:01:56,480
Josh is coming for dinner.

45
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:57,538
Why?

46
00:01:57,616 --> 00:01:58,878
He's your stepbrother!

47
00:01:58,951 --> 00:02:01,419
You were hardly married to his mother.

48
00:02:01,487 --> 00:02:03,546
Why do I have to see Josh?

49
00:02:03,622 --> 00:02:05,920
You divorce wives, not children.

50
00:02:05,991 --> 00:02:07,219
Here.

51
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,624
Forget it!

52
00:02:08,694 --> 00:02:11,424
Did I show you
the loqued out Jeep Daddy got me?

53
00:02:11,497 --> 00:02:13,931
It's got four-wheel drive,
dual side airbags,

54
00:02:13,999 --> 00:02:15,432
and a monster sound system.

55
00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:16,934
I don't have a license yet,

56
00:02:17,002 --> 00:02:19,232
but I need something to learn on.

57
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,205
Boy! That came out of nowhere!

58
00:02:24,276 --> 00:02:25,937
Here's where Dionne lives.

59
00:02:26,011 --> 00:02:27,444
She's my friend

60
00:02:27,513 --> 00:02:29,947
because we both know what it's like

61
00:02:30,015 --> 00:02:32,245
to have people jealous of us.

62
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,445
- Girlfriend!
- I must give her snaps

63
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,454
for her courageous fashion efforts.

64
00:02:36,522 --> 00:02:38,456
Hey, Cher.

65
00:02:38,524 --> 00:02:41,960
Dionne and I were both named
after great singers of the past

66
00:02:42,027 --> 00:02:44,154
who now do infomercials.

67
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,993
So?

68
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:47,157
Been shopping with Dr. Seuss?

69
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:49,633
I wouldn't skin a collie for a backpack.

70
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:51,499
It's faux.

71
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:53,538
Hello! That was a stop sign.

72
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:55,096
I totally paused.

73
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:57,608
Yeah. O.K.

74
00:03:00,412 --> 00:03:03,279
It's not even 8:30,
and Murray is paging me.

75
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,907
He is so possessive.

76
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:06,918
This weekend he called me,

77
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:08,419
and he's all, Where were you today?

78
00:03:08,487 --> 00:03:10,114
Dionne and her boyfriend Murray

79
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:12,419
are in this dramatic relationship.

80
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:14,686
I think they've seen
that lke and Tina Turner movie

81
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,920
just too many times.

82
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:18,395
Now, I have to say to her...

83
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:21,524
Why do you put up with it?
You could do better.

84
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,862
I know. Shh. Here he comes.

85
00:03:26,038 --> 00:03:28,165
Woman, why don't you
be answering any of my pages?

86
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,332
I hate when you call me woman.

87
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,932
Where you been all weekend?

88
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,534
You jeepin' behind my back?

89
00:03:32,611 --> 00:03:33,942
Jeepin'.

90
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:36,447
No! But speaking of vehicular sex,

91
00:03:36,515 --> 00:03:39,450
perhaps you can explain
how this Kmart hair extension

92
00:03:39,518 --> 00:03:41,452
got into the backseat of your car.

93
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,318
I don't know where that came from.

94
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,950
That looks like one of
your stringy something or anothers.

95
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:48,960
I do not wear polyester hair, O.K.?

96
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:51,121
Unlike Shawanna.

97
00:03:51,196 --> 00:03:52,220
Dee, I'm Audi.

98
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:53,458
Bye.

99
00:03:53,532 --> 00:03:55,363
That's it. I've had it with you.

100
00:03:55,434 --> 00:03:57,664
Is it that time of the month again?

101
00:03:57,736 --> 00:03:59,169
I don't know why

102
00:03:59,238 --> 00:04:01,900
Dionne's going out
with a high school boy.

103
00:04:01,974 --> 00:04:03,407
They're like dogs.

104
00:04:03,475 --> 00:04:05,409
You have to clean them and feed them.

105
00:04:05,477 --> 00:04:06,910
They're just like
these nervous creatures

106
00:04:06,979 --> 00:04:08,913
that jump and slobber all over you.

107
00:04:08,981 --> 00:04:10,915
Ew! Get off of me!

108
00:04:10,983 --> 00:04:11,915
[Crash]

109
00:04:11,984 --> 00:04:13,781
Oh, as if!

110
00:04:13,852 --> 00:04:18,414
Should all oppressed people
be allowed refuge in America?

111
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,924
Amber will take the con position.

112
00:04:20,993 --> 00:04:22,927
Cher will be pro.

113
00:04:22,995 --> 00:04:24,929
Cher, two minutes.

114
00:04:24,997 --> 00:04:27,431
So. O.K.

115
00:04:27,499 --> 00:04:29,433
Like, right now, for example,

116
00:04:29,501 --> 00:04:32,436
the Haiti-ans need to come to America.

117
00:04:32,504 --> 00:04:33,937
Some people are all,

118
00:04:34,006 --> 00:04:35,940
What about
the strain on our resources?

119
00:04:36,008 --> 00:04:37,942
Like, when I had this garden party

120
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,602
for my father's birthday, right?

121
00:04:39,678 --> 00:04:42,704
I said RSVP because
it was a sit-down dinner.

122
00:04:42,781 --> 00:04:45,443
But people came that,
like, did not RSVP,

123
00:04:45,517 --> 00:04:47,815
so I was, like, totally buggin'.

124
00:04:47,886 --> 00:04:50,446
I had to haul ass to the kitchen,

125
00:04:50,522 --> 00:04:53,047
redistribute the food,
squish in extra place settings.

126
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:54,956
By the end of the day,

127
00:04:55,027 --> 00:04:56,892
it was, like, the more the merrier.

128
00:04:56,962 --> 00:04:59,897
So if the government
could just get to the kitchen,

129
00:04:59,965 --> 00:05:01,398
rearrange some things,

130
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:04,402
we could certainly
party with the Haiti-ans.

131
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:08,406
May I remind you
that it does not say RSVP

132
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,374
on the Statue of Liberty?

133
00:05:10,442 --> 00:05:12,342
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

134
00:05:12,411 --> 00:05:13,901
Thank you very much.

135
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:16,072
[Applause]

136
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,044
Amber, reply?

137
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:24,419
Mr. Hall, how can I answer that?

138
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,923
The topic is Haiti,

139
00:05:25,991 --> 00:05:28,186
and she's talking about
some little party.

140
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,627
Hello! It was his 50th birthday.

141
00:05:31,697 --> 00:05:32,925
Whatever.

142
00:05:32,998 --> 00:05:36,490
If she doesn't do the assignment,
I can't do mine.

143
00:05:36,568 --> 00:05:38,433
Ladies.

144
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:42,440
So, does anyone have
any further thoughts on Cher's oration?

145
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:43,941
Elton, comments?

146
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:45,943
Yeah, I can't find
my Cranberries CD.

147
00:05:46,011 --> 00:05:47,945
I got to go to the quad
before somebody snags it.

148
00:05:48,013 --> 00:05:49,947
I'm afraid I can't permit that.

149
00:05:50,015 --> 00:05:51,346
Any further insights?

150
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:52,975
I have an insight, Mr. Hall.

151
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:54,349
I'm all ears.

152
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,389
O.K., like, the way I feel
about the Rolling Stones

153
00:05:57,456 --> 00:06:01,392
is the way my kids are going
to feel about Nine Inch Nails,

154
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:04,122
so I really shouldn't torment
my mom anymore, huh?

155
00:06:04,196 --> 00:06:08,189
Yes, well, it's a little
off the subject of Haiti,

156
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:11,134
but tolerance is always a good lesson.

157
00:06:11,203 --> 00:06:14,900
Even when it comes out of nowhere.

158
00:06:14,973 --> 00:06:16,907
And with that in mind,

159
00:06:16,975 --> 00:06:19,409
I'm going to distribute
your report cards.

160
00:06:19,478 --> 00:06:22,413
Now, is there
a Christian Stovitz in this class?

161
00:06:22,481 --> 00:06:23,914
Mr. Hall, the buzz on Christian

162
00:06:23,982 --> 00:06:25,916
is that his parents have joint custody.

163
00:06:25,984 --> 00:06:27,918
He'll be spending
one semester in Chicago

164
00:06:27,986 --> 00:06:29,419
and one semester here.

165
00:06:29,488 --> 00:06:33,117
I think it is a travesty
of the legal profession.

166

00:14:00,972 --> 00:14:02,906
to include in his speech,

328
00:14:02,974 --> 00:14:04,407
I'll go on.

329
00:14:04,475 --> 00:14:05,908
Cher Horowitz... two tardies.

330
00:14:05,977 --> 00:14:07,137
I object!

331
00:14:07,211 --> 00:14:09,475
Do you recall the dates
of these alleged tardies?

332
00:14:09,547 --> 00:14:11,447
One was last Monday.

333
00:14:11,516 --> 00:14:14,417
Mr. Hall,
I was surfing the crimson wave.

334
00:14:14,485 --> 00:14:16,612
I had to haul ass to the ladies.

335
00:14:16,688 --> 00:14:18,918
I assume you are referring
to women's troubles,

336
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,651
so I'll let that one slide.

337
00:14:20,725 --> 00:14:22,420
Thank you, Mr. Hall.

338
00:14:22,493 --> 00:14:24,859
Miss Geist was right about you.

339
00:14:24,929 --> 00:14:27,420
What do you mean?

340
00:14:27,498 --> 00:14:29,932
Well, she said that you were

341
00:14:30,001 --> 00:14:33,437
the only one in this school
with any intelligence.

342
00:14:37,775 --> 00:14:39,265
Cher, get in here.

343
00:14:39,344 --> 00:14:41,312
Yes, Daddy?

344
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:44,007
Will you tell me
what the hell this is?

345
00:14:44,082 --> 00:14:47,483
A second notice for
three outstanding tickets.

346
00:14:47,552 --> 00:14:50,453
I don't remember
getting a first notice.

347
00:14:50,521 --> 00:14:52,455
The ticket is the first notice.

348
00:14:52,523 --> 00:14:54,491
I didn't know you could
get tickets without a license!

349
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:56,891
Sure you can.
You can get tickets anytime.

350
00:14:56,961 --> 00:14:58,895
Well, not around here you can't.

351
00:14:58,963 --> 00:15:02,296
From this moment on,
you will not drive,

352
00:15:02,367 --> 00:15:04,301
sit, do anything in that Jeep

353
00:15:04,369 --> 00:15:05,996
without a supervised driver.

354
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:07,901
No cruising around with Dionne.

355
00:15:07,972 --> 00:15:09,803
Two permits do not
equal a license.

356
00:15:09,874 --> 00:15:11,899
Do I make myself clear?

357
00:15:11,976 --> 00:15:13,500
Yes, Daddy.

358
00:15:13,578 --> 00:15:16,172
Cher, I expect you
to become a good driver.

359
00:15:16,247 --> 00:15:19,182
I will. I'm going to
practice real hard.

360
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,886
O.K.

361
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:24,920
A licensed driver
with nothing to do?

362
00:15:24,989 --> 00:15:27,924
Where would I find such a loser?

363
00:15:27,992 --> 00:15:30,426
Granola breath, you got
something on your chin.

364
00:15:30,494 --> 00:15:31,927
I'm growing a goatee.

365
00:15:31,996 --> 00:15:34,430
You don't want
to be the last one

366
00:15:34,498 --> 00:15:36,432
at the coffeehouse
without chin pubes.

367
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,434
I enjoy these little chats of ours,

368
00:15:38,502 --> 00:15:40,436
but in the interest of saving time,

369
00:15:40,504 --> 00:15:42,438
just tell me what you want.

370
00:15:42,506 --> 00:15:44,440
O.K.

371
00:15:44,508 --> 00:15:46,840
So, actually, I have a permit,

372
00:15:46,911 --> 00:15:49,937
but Daddy says
I can't take the Jeep out

373
00:15:50,014 --> 00:15:51,811
without a licensed driver.

374
00:15:51,882 --> 00:15:53,611
Since you're not doing anything...

375
00:15:53,684 --> 00:15:55,652
What are the chances
of you shutting up

376
00:15:55,719 --> 00:15:57,380
till you get your way?

377
00:15:57,454 --> 00:15:58,887
Slim to none.

378
00:15:58,956 --> 00:16:01,254
Come on.

379
00:16:01,325 --> 00:16:02,883
Hey, James Bond.

380
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,690
In America, we drive
on the right side of the road.

381
00:16:05,763 --> 00:16:08,357
I am. You try driving in platforms.

382
00:16:08,432 --> 00:16:10,400
I got to get back to school.

383
00:16:10,467 --> 00:16:12,094
Want to practice parking?

384
00:16:12,169 --> 00:16:15,002
What's the point?
Everywhere you go has valet.

385
00:16:15,072 --> 00:16:17,404
What class you going to?

386
00:16:17,474 --> 00:16:19,999
Actually, I'm going
to a Tree People meeting.

387
00:16:20,077 --> 00:16:23,410
We might get Marky Mark
to plant a celebrity tree.

388
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,913
How fabulous.

389
00:16:24,982 --> 00:16:27,416
Getting Marky Mark to take time

390
00:16:27,484 --> 00:16:29,418
from his busy
pants-dropping schedule

391
00:16:29,486 --> 00:16:30,919
to plant trees.

392
00:16:30,988 --> 00:16:32,615
Why don't you hire a gardener?

393
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:35,921
Maybe Marky Mark
wants to use his popularity

394
00:16:35,993 --> 00:16:38,791
for a good cause,
make a contribution.

395
00:16:38,862 --> 00:16:41,797
In case you've
never heard of that,

396
00:16:41,865 --> 00:16:43,423
a contribution is...

397
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,434
I have donated
many Italian outfits to Lucy.

398
00:16:45,502 --> 00:16:47,936
As soon as I get my license,

399
00:16:48,005 --> 00:16:49,939
I fully intend
to brake for animals,

400
00:16:50,007 --> 00:16:51,941
and I have contributed many hours

401
00:16:52,009 --> 00:16:54,944
to helping two lonely teachers
find romance.

402
00:16:55,012 --> 00:16:57,378
Which I'll bet serves
your interests more than theirs.

403
00:16:57,448 --> 00:17:00,383
If I ever saw you do anything
that wasn't 90% selfish,

404
00:17:00,451 --> 00:17:01,884
I'd die of shock.

405
00:17:01,952 --> 00:17:04,546
Oh, that would be
reason enough for me.

406
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,893
Would you call me selfish?

407
00:17:10,961 --> 00:17:12,895
No. Not to your face.

408
00:17:12,963 --> 00:17:14,396
Really?

409
00:17:14,465 --> 00:17:16,399
Is Josh giving you shit

410
00:17:16,467 --> 00:17:18,901
because he's in
his postadolescent idealistic phase?

411
00:17:18,969 --> 00:17:20,368
Look, there's Mr. Hall.

412
00:17:20,437 --> 00:17:22,405
Mr. Hall! Mr. Hall!

413
00:17:22,473 --> 00:17:24,407
Um, do you drink coffee?

414
00:17:24,475 --> 00:17:26,409
Not from this cafeteria.

415
00:17:26,477 --> 00:17:28,911
Yes, under normal circumstances.

416
00:17:28,979 --> 00:17:30,913
I am such a retard.

417
00:17:30,981 --> 00:17:32,915
When I was packing Daddy's lunch,

418
00:17:32,983 --> 00:17:34,917
I gave him my lemon Snapple

419
00:17:34,985 --> 00:17:36,919
and took his sucky Italian roast.

420
00:17:36,987 --> 00:17:38,921
Do you want it?

421
00:17:38,989 --> 00:17:40,923
You sure you don't want it?

422
00:17:40,991 --> 00:17:42,925
Tscha! It might stunt my growth.

423
00:17:42,993 --> 00:17:44,426
I want to be 5'10
like Cindy Crawford.

424
00:17:44,495 --> 00:17:46,929
But I thought you or Miss Geist
might like it.

425
00:17:46,997 --> 00:17:48,931
Maybe you could share it.

426
00:17:48,999 --> 00:17:50,432
Well... thanks.

427
00:17:50,501 --> 00:17:51,934
Sure.

428
00:17:55,606 --> 00:17:57,335
- Miss Geist!
- Miss Geist!

429
00:17:57,408 --> 00:17:59,569
Did you sign up
for the environmental fair?

430
00:17:59,643 --> 00:18:00,871
We will.

431
00:18:00,944 --> 00:18:02,878
You have pretty eyes.
Don't hide them.

432
00:18:02,946 --> 00:18:04,880
These clips are so cute.

433
00:18:04,948 --> 00:18:06,882
And this tiny little waist.

434
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,383
Look. Wow.

435
00:18:08,452 --> 00:18:09,919
Girls.

436
00:18:09,987 --> 00:18:14,424
Oh, don't forget to sign up
for the environmental fair.

437
00:18:14,491 --> 00:18:17,392
Not a total Betty,
but a vast improvement.

438
00:18:17,461 --> 00:18:18,894
We did our best.

439
00:18:18,962 --> 00:18:21,157
We got to book to P.E.

440
00:18:21,231 --> 00:18:22,664
Come on, Dee.

441
00:18:22,733 --> 00:18:24,394
I feel like bailing, dude.

442
00:18:24,468 --> 00:18:27,403
I know what you mean,
but at least it's exercise.

443
00:18:27,471 --> 00:18:29,905
I feel like such a heifer.

444
00:18:29,973 --> 00:18:32,407
I had two bowls of Special K,

445
00:18:32,476 --> 00:18:33,909
three pieces of turkey bacon,

446
00:18:33,977 --> 00:18:35,410
five peanut butter M&M's,

447
00:18:35,479 --> 00:18:36,912
and, like, three pieces of licorice.

448
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,174
Oh, my God. Look.

449
00:18:38,248 --> 00:18:41,411
Is that a photo op or what?

450
00:18:41,485 --> 00:18:43,419
Look at that body language...

451
00:18:43,487 --> 00:18:45,921
Legs crossed towards each other.

452
00:18:45,989 --> 00:18:47,980
That's an unequivocal sex invite.

453
00:18:51,895 --> 00:18:54,022
Oh, Cher, he's getting her digits.

454
00:18:54,098 --> 00:18:56,464
Look at Geist. She is so cute.

455
00:18:56,533 --> 00:18:57,864
Ohh.

456
00:18:57,935 --> 00:19:01,371
Old people can be so sweet.

457
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:09,875
? The world is full of fools?

458
00:19:09,947 --> 00:19:13,747
? Who never get it right?

459
00:19:13,817 --> 00:19:17,378
? You don't know what to do?

460
00:19:17,454 --> 00:19:22,050
? So you do anything you like?

461
00:19:22,126 --> 00:19:24,390
? Put your feet in drive?

462
00:19:24,461 --> 00:19:26,395
? Oh, you're a silly thing?

463
00:19:26,463 --> 00:19:27,657
? Put your feet in drive?

464
00:19:27,731 --> 00:19:30,199
? You're such a pretty thing?

465
00:19:38,108 --> 00:19:39,905
? You're going out tonight?

466
00:19:41,478 --> 00:19:43,275
? There's nothing to lose...??

467
00:19:43,347 --> 00:19:46,407
The entire student body
was utterly grateful

468
00:19:46,483 --> 00:19:49,418
for the improvement
in their grades.

469
00:19:49,486 --> 00:19:53,422
? Don't ever change?

470
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:57,426
? Don't ever change?

471
00:19:57,494 --> 00:20:01,430
? No, never change??

472
00:20:05,502 --> 00:20:07,436
Cher, what's this all about?

473
00:20:07,504 --> 00:20:08,937
My report card?

474
00:20:09,006 --> 00:20:10,439
The same semester?

475
00:20:10,507 --> 00:20:11,940
Uh-huh.

476
00:20:12,009 --> 00:20:14,443
What did you do?
Turn in extra credit?

477
00:20:14,511 --> 00:20:15,944
No.

478
00:20:16,013 --> 00:20:17,446
Take the midterms over?

479
00:20:17,514 --> 00:20:18,947
Uh-uh.

480
00:20:19,016 --> 00:20:20,950
You mean to tell me

481
00:20:21,018 --> 00:20:25,455
that you argued your way
from a C-plus to an A-minus?

482
00:20:25,522 --> 00:20:28,457
Totally based
on my powers of persuasion.

483
00:20:28,525 --> 00:20:29,958
You proud?

484
00:20:30,027 --> 00:20:34,464
I couldn't be happier
if they were based on real grades.

485
00:20:34,531 --> 00:20:36,396
Fabulous.

486
00:20:39,036 --> 00:20:43,973
I felt so satisfied,
I wanted to do more good deeds.

487
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,975
Ah-choo!

488
00:20:46,043 --> 00:20:47,977
Dee, when your allergies act up,

489
00:20:48,045 --> 00:20:49,808
take out your nose ring.

490
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,973
Follow through! There you go.

491
00:20:52,049 --> 00:20:53,482
There you go.

492
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:54,915
All right, Cher!

493
00:20:54,985 --> 00:20:58,352
Earth to Cher. Come in, Cher.

494
00:21:01,491 --> 00:21:03,425
Ms. Stoeger...

495
00:21:03,493 --> 00:21:05,427
I would just like to say

496
00:21:05,495 --> 00:21:08,931
that physical education
in this school is a disgrace.

497
00:21:08,999 --> 00:21:11,433
I mean, standing in line
for 40 minutes

498
00:21:11,501 --> 00:21:12,934
is hardly aerobically effective.

499
00:21:13,003 --> 00:21:14,937
I doubt I worked off the calories

500
00:21:15,005 --> 00:21:16,666
in a stick of Carefree gum.

501
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,901
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

502
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,705
You exercised your mouth, Cher.

503
00:21:20,777 --> 00:21:22,210
Hit the ball.

504
00:21:25,015 --> 00:21:26,448
Ms. Stoeger,

505
00:21:26,516 --> 00:21:28,746
that machine is just
a lawsuit waiting to happen.

506
00:21:28,819 --> 00:21:30,286
Thanks for the legal advice.

507
00:21:30,354 --> 00:21:33,118
Dionne, you're up.

508
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:35,454
I have a note from
my tennis instructor

509
00:21:35,525 --> 00:21:37,959
saying I shouldn't expose myself
to any training

510
00:21:38,028 --> 00:21:39,689
that might derail his teachings.

511
00:21:39,763 --> 00:21:41,458
Fine.

512
00:21:41,531 --> 00:21:43,863
Amber!

513
00:21:43,934 --> 00:21:46,960
My plastic surgeon doesn't
want me doing any activity

514
00:21:47,037 --> 00:21:49,471
where balls fly at my nose.

515
00:21:49,539 --> 00:21:51,268
Well, there goes your social life.

516

[Man]
Ms. Stoeger...

517
00:21:54,544 --> 00:21:56,478
got another one.

518
00:21:56,546 --> 00:21:59,413
Ladies, we have
a new student with us.

519
00:21:59,483 --> 00:22:00,973
This is Tai Frasier.

520
00:22:03,654 --> 00:22:07,146
You could hit a few balls
in those clothes.

521
00:22:07,224 --> 00:22:11,320
She could be a farmer
in those clothes.

522
00:22:11,395 --> 00:22:14,421
Dee, my mission is clear.

523
00:22:14,498 --> 00:22:16,432
Would you look at that girl?

524
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,434
She is so adorably clueless.

525
00:22:18,502 --> 00:22:20,436
We've got to adopt her.

526
00:22:20,504 --> 00:22:21,903
She is toe up.

527
00:22:21,972 --> 00:22:23,439
Our stock would plummet.

528
00:22:23,507 --> 00:22:27,273
Don't you want to use
your popularity for a good cause?

529
00:22:27,344 --> 00:22:28,276
No.

530
00:22:28,345 --> 00:22:30,210
Come here! Yeah, come here.

531
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,770
Hang with us.

532
00:22:31,848 --> 00:22:33,247
Oh, thank you.

533
00:22:33,317 --> 00:22:35,285
How do you like California?

534
00:22:35,352 --> 00:22:36,944
Man, I'm freakin'.

535
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:40,183
I could really use some sort
of herbal refreshment.

536
00:22:40,257 --> 00:22:42,452
We do lunch in 10 minutes.

537
00:22:42,526 --> 00:22:45,461
We don't have any tea,
but we have Coke.

538
00:22:45,529 --> 00:22:47,121
You guys got coke here?

539
00:22:47,197 --> 00:22:48,630
Yeah. This is America.

540
00:22:50,233 --> 00:22:52,463
So we decided to show Tai

541
00:22:52,536 --> 00:22:54,504
the ropes at Bronson Alcott High School.

542
00:22:54,571 --> 00:22:56,937
That is Alana's group over there.

543
00:22:57,007 --> 00:22:58,709
They do the TV station.

544
00:22:58,842 --> 00:23:00,901
They think that's the most
important thing on Earth.

545
00:23:00,977 --> 00:23:02,706
And that's the Persian Mafia.

546
00:23:02,779 --> 00:23:05,646
You can't hang with them
unless you own a BMW.

547
00:23:05,716 --> 00:23:07,911
There's Elton in the white vest,

548
00:23:07,984 --> 00:23:09,952
with all the most popular boys.

549
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,420
Including my boyfriend.
Ain't he cute?

550
00:23:12,489 --> 00:23:14,923
If you decide
to date a high school boy,

551
00:23:14,991 --> 00:23:16,424
they're the only acceptable ones.

552
00:23:16,493 --> 00:23:18,427
Which one of them's your boyfriend?

553
00:23:18,495 --> 00:23:19,928
As if!

554
00:23:19,996 --> 00:23:21,930
Cher's got attitude
about high school boys.

555
00:23:21,998 --> 00:23:23,431
It's a personal choice

556
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,934
every woman has got
to make for herself.

557
00:23:26,002 --> 00:23:27,435
Woman, lend me $5.00.

558
00:23:27,504 --> 00:23:29,938
Murray, I have asked you repeatedly

559
00:23:30,006 --> 00:23:31,633
not to call me woman.

560
00:23:31,708 --> 00:23:33,107
Excuse me, Miss Dionne,

561
00:23:33,176 --> 00:23:36,441
street slang is an increasingly
valid form of expression.

562
00:23:36,513 --> 00:23:38,947
Most feminine pronouns
do have mocking

563
00:23:39,015 --> 00:23:41,882
but not necessarily
misogynistic undertone.

564
00:23:41,952 --> 00:23:44,443
Wow. You guys talk like grownups.

565
00:23:44,521 --> 00:23:47,217
Well, this is a really good school.

566
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:50,953
I'm going to go get a soda.
Do you guys want?

567
00:23:51,027 --> 00:23:52,688
Sure.

568
00:23:52,763 --> 00:23:54,162
She's nice.

569
00:23:54,231 --> 00:23:56,096
Ooh! Project!

00:24:04,474 --> 00:24:05,907
Oh, wow.

571
00:24:05,976 --> 00:24:06,908
That's disgusting.

00:24:08,478 --> 00:24:10,912

Thanks.

Those are really nice stickers.

576
00:24:13,617 --> 00:24:16,415
I was thinking it was too cluttered.

577
00:24:16,486 --> 00:24:18,420
I want to concentrate on

578
00:24:18,488 --> 00:24:19,921
one main decorative statement,

579
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:22,015
like Marvin the Martian right there.

580
00:24:22,092 --> 00:24:24,458
I can do Marvin the Martian.

00:24:24,528 --> 00:24:25,495

I mean there's not
really a lot to him,

Wait. I got one here.

You didn't trace these?

Uh-uh. No.

Here's another one over here...

591

and lots of little guys.

And you lose weight

I'll be 16 in May.

My birthday's in April,
and as someone older,

can I please give you some advice?

611
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:29,925
It is one thing
to spark up a doobie at parties,

612
00:25:29,993 --> 00:25:32,427
but it is another
to be fried all day.

613

Do you see the distinction?

Yeah.

Loadies generally hang
on the grassy knoll.

Sometimes they come to class
and say bonehead things,

617
00:25:41,504 --> 00:25:43,028
and we all laugh, of course,

618
00:25:43,106 --> 00:25:46,166
but no respectable girl
actually dates them.

619
00:25:46,243 --> 00:25:47,938
You don't want to start off

620
00:25:48,011 --> 00:25:49,706
on the wrong foot, do you?

621
00:25:49,779 --> 00:25:51,212
I've got an idea.

622
00:25:51,281 --> 00:25:52,942

No. No.

625

Cher's main thrill
in life is a makeover.

626
00:26:01,024 --> 00:26:02,889
It gives her a sense of control
in a chaotic world.

Sure. Why not?

and Buns Of Steel

659
00:27:34,484 --> 00:27:36,918
and reading one
nonschool book a week.

660
00:27:36,987 --> 00:27:39,421
My first book is Fit Or Fat.

661
00:27:39,489 --> 00:27:42,925
Mine is Men Are From Mars,
Women Are From Venus.

662
00:27:42,993 --> 00:27:44,460
Good.

663
00:27:44,527 --> 00:27:46,324
That takes care
of our minds and bodies,

664
00:27:46,396 --> 00:27:49,160
but we should do
something good for mankind

665
00:27:49,232 --> 00:27:51,132
for a couple of hours.

666
00:27:51,201 --> 00:27:53,396
Hey, brainiac.

667
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:54,767
Ugh. The dreaded ex.

668
00:27:54,838 --> 00:27:56,135
Tai, this is Josh.

669
00:27:56,206 --> 00:27:57,935
Nice to meet you.

670
00:27:58,008 --> 00:27:59,566
Hey! You know about this stuff.

671
00:27:59,642 --> 00:28:02,577
I want to do something
good for humanity.

672
00:28:02,645 --> 00:28:04,135
How about sterilization?

673
00:28:04,214 --> 00:28:06,239
Ha ha ha!

674
00:28:08,985 --> 00:28:10,384
So what do you think?

675
00:28:10,453 --> 00:28:11,886
I'm amazed.

676
00:28:11,955 --> 00:28:14,890
That I am devoting myself
so generously to someone else?

677
00:28:14,958 --> 00:28:17,893
That you found someone
more clueless than you are

678
00:28:17,961 --> 00:28:19,394
to worship you.

679
00:28:19,462 --> 00:28:21,396
I am rescuing her from teenage hell.

680
00:28:21,464 --> 00:28:22,897
The wounds of adolescence

681
00:28:22,966 --> 00:28:24,900
can take years to heal.

682
00:28:24,968 --> 00:28:26,401
You've never had a mother.

683
00:28:26,469 --> 00:28:28,403
You're acting out on that poor girl

684
00:28:28,471 --> 00:28:29,904
like your Barbie doll.

Freshman Psych.

686
00:28:31,474 --> 00:28:33,408
I am not taking Psych.

687
00:28:33,476 --> 00:28:35,410
I am going to take that lost soul

688
00:28:35,478 --> 00:28:37,912
and make her well-dressed and popular.

689
00:28:37,981 --> 00:28:40,415
Her life will be better
because of me.

690
00:28:40,483 --> 00:28:42,951
How many girls can
say that about you?

691
00:28:43,019 --> 00:28:45,385
? Mentos better?

692
00:28:45,455 --> 00:28:47,184
? Mentos fresher?

693
00:28:47,257 --> 00:28:48,622
? Fresh goes better?

694
00:28:48,691 --> 00:28:50,921
? With Mentos,
fresh and full of life!??

[Television]
Mentos.

696
00:28:52,495 --> 00:28:53,689
The freshmaker.

697
00:28:53,763 --> 00:28:55,230
Be seeing ya.

698
00:28:55,298 --> 00:28:56,822
Yeah, I hope not sporadically.

699
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,375
Do you see how boys
are responding?

700
00:29:06,443 --> 00:29:08,377
My heart is totally bursting.

701
00:29:08,445 --> 00:29:09,878
I know!

702
00:29:09,946 --> 00:29:11,379
Cher, you have Deamer?

Geist.

704
00:29:12,949 --> 00:29:14,883
Hey, Tai, did you get a flyer?

705
00:29:14,951 --> 00:29:16,384
Uh-uh.

706
00:29:16,453 --> 00:29:17,886
Wow! A party!

707
00:29:17,954 --> 00:29:19,387
It's in the Valley.

708
00:29:19,456 --> 00:29:21,549
The cops usually break them up
in less than an hour,

709
00:29:21,624 --> 00:29:22,955
and it takes that long to get there.

710
00:29:23,026 --> 00:29:24,994
It's just local loadies.

711
00:29:25,061 --> 00:29:27,120
Do you guys think
Travis will be there?

712
00:29:27,197 --> 00:29:28,892
I thought we moved
on from there.

713
00:29:28,965 --> 00:29:30,626
Don't sell yourself short.

714
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,100
You've got something no one here has.

715
00:29:33,169 --> 00:29:35,069
I'm not a virgin.

716
00:29:35,138 --> 00:29:37,106
As far as everyone's concerned,

717
00:29:37,173 --> 00:29:38,902
you're the most popular girl
in your school.

718
00:29:38,975 --> 00:29:41,910
The fact that you hang
with Dee and l, well...

719
00:29:41,978 --> 00:29:43,411
Speaks very highly of you.

720
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,414
If you strike
while the iron is hot,

721
00:29:45,482 --> 00:29:47,416
you can have any guy
that you want.

722
00:29:47,484 --> 00:29:48,917
Like who?

723
00:29:48,985 --> 00:29:50,418
Who's available?

724
00:29:50,487 --> 00:29:51,920
There's Bronson...

725
00:29:51,988 --> 00:29:53,421
I got it! Elton!

726
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:54,923
He just broke up with Folette!

727
00:29:54,991 --> 00:29:56,424
Who's Elton?

728
00:29:56,493 --> 00:29:57,926
He's way popular,

729
00:29:57,994 --> 00:29:59,928
like the social director of the Crew.

730
00:29:59,996 --> 00:30:01,930
His dad can get you into any concert.

731
00:30:01,998 --> 00:30:03,932
I noticed him scoping you out.

732
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,433
He was looking at me?

733
00:30:05,502 --> 00:30:06,935
Says you gave him a toothache.

734
00:30:07,003 --> 00:30:08,436
How'd I do that?

735
00:30:08,505 --> 00:30:10,200
He thought you were sweet.

736
00:30:10,273 --> 00:30:11,934
Yeah?

737
00:30:12,008 --> 00:30:14,442
Yeah? Wow!

738
00:30:14,511 --> 00:30:15,842
Is that true?

739
00:30:15,912 --> 00:30:17,243
No.

740
00:30:17,313 --> 00:30:18,644
You are so bad!

741
00:30:24,154 --> 00:30:26,987
O.K., you guys,
all get together.

742
00:30:27,056 --> 00:30:28,318
That is great.

743

Smile!

744
00:30:38,034 --> 00:30:40,628
Tai, get a little closer.

745
00:30:44,374 --> 00:30:46,171
Closer, Tai.

746
00:30:46,242 --> 00:30:47,470
Oh, great.

00:30:47,544 --> 00:30:49,011
Hey, Elton, um...

why don't you put
your arm around Tai?

749
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:54,983
All right.

750
00:30:55,051 --> 00:30:56,279
Yeah, that's good.

Yeah, she's beautiful.

those Botticelli chicks.

Why don't you make me
a copy of this, O.K.?

761
00:31:23,512 --> 00:31:24,945
Sure.

762
00:31:26,348 --> 00:31:28,942
Hi, Daddy. This is my friend Tai.

What is this crap?

766
00:31:35,724 --> 00:31:37,453
It's from the
Cut Your Cholesterol Cookbook.

767

But it's Dionne.
It might be important.

We're having a nice family dinner.

772
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:51,369
So, uh, what did you do
in school today?

with someone I had lukewarm feelings for

1482
01:02:11,425 --> 01:02:12,858
because Christian is brutally hot,

1483
01:02:12,926 --> 01:02:15,360
and I am going to
remember tonight forever.

1484
01:02:15,429 --> 01:02:16,521
Blot.

1485
01:02:18,065 --> 01:02:19,362
[Ding-dong]

1486
01:02:23,937 --> 01:02:25,370
Hi.

1487
01:02:25,439 --> 01:02:26,872
Hi.

1488
01:02:28,942 --> 01:02:31,376
Is something burning?

1489
01:02:31,445 --> 01:02:32,878
Oh, my God!

1490
01:02:39,953 --> 01:02:41,386
Oops.

1491
01:02:41,455 --> 01:02:43,889
Aw, honey, you baked.

1492
01:02:43,957 --> 01:02:45,891
I tried.

1493
01:02:45,959 --> 01:02:49,395
Come on. Show me
the rest of your pad.

1494
01:02:51,765 --> 01:02:54,700
Your father has
a well-rounded collection.

1495
01:02:54,768 --> 01:02:56,895
Daddy says it's a good investment.

1496
01:02:56,970 --> 01:02:58,403
He's absolutely right.

1497
01:02:58,472 --> 01:02:59,404
Claes Oldenburg.

1498
01:02:59,473 --> 01:03:01,407
He's way famous.

1499
01:03:01,475 --> 01:03:02,908
Ooh.

1500
01:03:02,976 --> 01:03:05,342
But this is older, see?

1501
01:03:05,412 --> 01:03:06,845
Transitional.

1502
01:03:06,913 --> 01:03:08,847
A very important piece.

1503
01:03:08,915 --> 01:03:11,349
Um, you want to go swimming?

1504
01:03:11,418 --> 01:03:13,852
Mmm.

1505
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:15,353
Let's watch the movies.

1506
01:03:15,422 --> 01:03:17,219
Oh, O.K.

1507
01:03:17,291 --> 01:03:19,851
Christian had a thing for Tony Curtis,

1508
01:03:19,926 --> 01:03:22,360
so he brought over Some Like It Hot

1509
01:03:22,429 --> 01:03:23,760
and Sparatacus.

1510
01:03:23,830 --> 01:03:25,354
Singer of songs.

1511
01:03:25,432 --> 01:03:28,924
For whom did you practice
this wondrous talent?

1512
01:03:29,002 --> 01:03:31,436
For the children of my master,

1513
01:03:31,505 --> 01:03:33,564
whom I also taught the classics.

1514
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:35,369
Classics, indeed?

1515
01:03:35,442 --> 01:03:37,171
What position have we, I wonder,

1516
01:03:37,244 --> 01:03:40,839
for a boy of such varied gifts?

1517
01:03:42,282 --> 01:03:44,716
You shall be my body servant.

1518
01:03:44,785 --> 01:03:46,377
All of you, come with me.

1519
01:03:48,955 --> 01:03:51,116
My feet are cold.

1520
01:03:57,664 --> 01:04:00,428
Huh. Thanks.

1521
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:01,933
Oh, watch this part.

1522
01:04:02,002 --> 01:04:03,902
This is good.

1523
01:04:06,406 --> 01:04:07,839
Are you O.K.?

1524
01:04:07,908 --> 01:04:09,341
Uh, I'm fine.

1525
01:04:09,409 --> 01:04:11,843
Um, do you want some...
something to drink?

1526
01:04:11,912 --> 01:04:13,470
I could get you some wine.

1527
01:04:13,547 --> 01:04:16,345
No. You notice how wine makes people

1528
01:04:16,416 --> 01:04:18,350
want to feel, like, sexy?

1529
01:04:18,418 --> 01:04:20,352
Well, that's O.K.

1530
01:04:23,423 --> 01:04:26,358
I'm actually getting tired.

1531
01:04:27,761 --> 01:04:30,855
But I can make you
some coffee if you'd like.

1532
01:04:30,931 --> 01:04:32,865
Oh, no, thanks. Got the ulcer.

1533
01:04:32,933 --> 01:04:36,369
But you had all
those cappuccinos before.

1534
01:04:36,436 --> 01:04:40,634
Oh. Well, you know,
that was, like, uh, foam.

1535
01:04:45,445 --> 01:04:46,878
You're great.

1536
01:04:46,947 --> 01:04:49,381
We're friends, right?

1537
01:04:49,449 --> 01:04:50,882
Yeah.

1538
01:04:52,285 --> 01:04:55,379
Knock me a little kiss.

1539
01:04:55,455 --> 01:04:56,888
See you.

1540
01:05:01,962 --> 01:05:03,896
I don't get it.

1541
01:05:03,964 --> 01:05:05,829
Did my hair get flat?

1542
01:05:05,899 --> 01:05:08,333
Did I stumble into
some bad lighting?

1543
01:05:08,402 --> 01:05:10,370
What's wrong with me?

1544
01:05:10,437 --> 01:05:11,836
Nothing.

1545
01:05:11,905 --> 01:05:13,167
Maybe he really was tired.

1546
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:15,333
I suppose it wasn't meant to be.

1547
01:05:15,409 --> 01:05:17,343
He does dress better than I do.

1548
01:05:17,411 --> 01:05:19,345
What would I bring
to the relationship?

1549
01:05:19,413 --> 01:05:20,573
Get back into the right lane...

1550
01:05:20,647 --> 01:05:22,080
What's the first thing you do?

1551
01:05:22,149 --> 01:05:24,344
First thing I do
is put on my blinker.

1552
01:05:24,418 --> 01:05:27,854
- Oh, wait. Shit.
- Watch the road!

1553
01:05:27,921 --> 01:05:31,357
Stop. Then I look
in my mirror. O.K.

1554
01:05:31,425 --> 01:05:35,020
Then I glance
at my blind spot.

1555
01:05:35,095 --> 01:05:37,620
With your head,
not the whole car!

1556
01:05:37,697 --> 01:05:40,359
I swear to God.
I swear to God, woman!

1557
01:05:40,434 --> 01:05:41,765
You can't drive for shit!

1558
01:05:41,835 --> 01:05:43,234
I'm not trying to hear that.

1559
01:05:43,303 --> 01:05:44,736
Hear me! You...

1560
01:05:44,805 --> 01:05:46,170
Actually, going all the way

1561
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:48,366
is, like, a really big decision.

1562
01:05:48,442 --> 01:05:51,377
I can't believe I was
so capricious about it.

1563
01:05:51,445 --> 01:05:53,037
Dee, I almost had sex with him.

1564
01:05:53,113 --> 01:05:54,444
You almost had sex with who?

1565
01:05:54,514 --> 01:05:55,742
Christian.

1566
01:05:57,484 --> 01:05:59,975
What?

1567
01:06:00,053 --> 01:06:02,988
Yo, look!
Are you bitches blind or something?

1568
01:06:03,056 --> 01:06:04,614
Your man Christian is a cake boy.

1569
01:06:04,691 --> 01:06:05,783
- A what?
- A what?

1570
01:06:05,859 --> 01:06:08,123
He's a disco-dancing,
Oscar-Wilde-reading,

1571
01:06:08,195 --> 01:06:10,891
Streisand ticket-holding
friend of Dorothy.

1572
01:06:10,964 --> 01:06:12,829
Uh-uh. No way.

1573
01:06:12,899 --> 01:06:13,831
He's gay.

1574
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:14,832
Not even.

1575
01:06:14,901 --> 01:06:15,833
Yes, even.

1576
01:06:15,902 --> 01:06:17,961
He does like to shop, Cher,

1577
01:06:18,038 --> 01:06:19,665
and the boy can dress.

1578
01:06:19,739 --> 01:06:22,173
Oh, my God.
I'm totally buggin'.

1579
01:06:22,242 --> 01:06:25,109
I feel like such a bonehead.

1580
01:06:25,178 --> 01:06:26,611
What the hell?

1581
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:28,238
Yo! You're getting on the freeway!

1582
01:06:28,315 --> 01:06:29,976
Turn right! Get out of the lane!

1583
01:06:30,050 --> 01:06:32,951
No, no! Forget procedure!
Get out of the lane!

What do I do, Murray?

1588
01:06:40,227 --> 01:06:42,661
Go straight! Go straight!
Go straight!

Oh, shit!

Just relax and drive, baby.

Boy, getting off the freeway

how important love is.

1616
01:07:39,852 --> 01:07:41,149
After that, Dionne's virginity

1617
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:43,347
went from technical to nonexistent.

1618
01:07:43,422 --> 01:07:48,052
I realized how much I wanted
a boyfriend of my own.

1619
01:07:48,127 --> 01:07:51,358
Not that Christian wasn't
a blast to hang out with.

1620
01:07:51,430 --> 01:07:54,365
He was becoming one of
my favorite shopping partners.

So was the red.

Um, where's Tai?

1623
01:07:58,938 --> 01:08:01,372
She met some random guys
at the Foot Locker

1624
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:03,340
and escorted them right over there.

Oh, my God! Did you...

1626

I don't know where
she meets these Barneys.

1627

I have a question, all right?

01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:09,472
What?

1629

Somebody could get killed.

1647
01:08:43,616 --> 01:08:47,382
Oh, my God.
Cher, you don't understand.

1648
01:08:47,453 --> 01:08:49,353
I was sitting there.
I was just talking to those guys.

1649
01:08:49,421 --> 01:08:51,855
All of a sudden,
we were laughing and...

1650
01:08:51,924 --> 01:08:53,016
Hey, you O.K.?

1651
01:08:53,092 --> 01:08:54,184
Y-yeah.

1652
01:08:54,260 --> 01:08:55,352
You sure?

1653
01:08:55,427 --> 01:08:56,519
I'm fine. Uh-huh.

1654
01:08:56,595 --> 01:08:58,859
Let's get you home for some R and R.

1655
01:08:58,931 --> 01:09:00,364
What's that?

1656
01:09:01,934 --> 01:09:04,368
Boy, considering
how clueless she was,

1657
01:09:04,436 --> 01:09:08,270
Tai certainly had
that damsel-in-distress act down.

1658
01:09:08,340 --> 01:09:09,773
Meanwhile, back at school,

1659
01:09:09,842 --> 01:09:11,275
everyone was talking about

1660
01:09:11,343 --> 01:09:13,811
Tai's brush with death at the mall.

1661
01:09:13,879 --> 01:09:17,315
Was it a montage of all the scenes
in your life?

1662
01:09:17,383 --> 01:09:19,146
Not exactly a montage.

1663
01:09:19,218 --> 01:09:22,813
Hey, Cher, is it true gang members
tried to shoot Tai?

1664
01:09:22,888 --> 01:09:23,980
No.

1665
01:09:24,056 --> 01:09:25,489
That's what everyone's saying.

1666
01:09:25,558 --> 01:09:26,820
Whatever.

1667
01:09:28,761 --> 01:09:31,821
When I was 9,
I fell off this jungle gym.

1668
01:09:31,897 --> 01:09:34,331
I swear I saw this...

1669
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:36,334
Will you move down for Cher?

1670
01:09:36,402 --> 01:09:38,336
Tell me more. Tell me more.

1671
01:09:38,404 --> 01:09:39,837
Where was I?

1672
01:09:39,905 --> 01:09:42,339
You were thinking about
what was really important.

1673
01:09:42,408 --> 01:09:43,841
Oh, right, right.

1674
01:09:43,909 --> 01:09:45,342
Right before you die,

1675
01:09:45,411 --> 01:09:47,379
your mind just
sort of gets very clear.

1676
01:09:47,446 --> 01:09:49,846
It's a very intense spiritual thing.

1677
01:09:49,915 --> 01:09:52,349
I know when I was held
at gunpoint...

1678
01:09:52,418 --> 01:09:53,851
Excuse me. You were saying?

1679
01:09:53,919 --> 01:09:55,011
It's spiritual.

1680
01:09:55,087 --> 01:09:57,021
I can't pinpoint the spirituality.

1681
01:09:57,089 --> 01:10:00,616
If you've never
experienced anything...

1682
01:10:00,693 --> 01:10:03,218
Tai, I was planning on going to Tower
and getting something for Christian.

1683
01:10:03,295 --> 01:10:04,557
Uh-huh.

1684
01:10:04,630 --> 01:10:06,894
Like some kind
of present or something.

1685
01:10:06,966 --> 01:10:10,060
- You want to come?
- Sure. I owe him my life.

1686
01:10:10,135 --> 01:10:11,534
I'll get you after school.

1687
01:10:11,604 --> 01:10:12,696
Yeah.

1688
01:10:12,771 --> 01:10:15,569
Not today. I'm going
over to Melrose with Amber.

1689
01:10:15,641 --> 01:10:17,336
We're going to Melrose.

1690
01:10:17,409 --> 01:10:20,845
Oh. Well, how about tomorrow?

1691
01:10:20,913 --> 01:10:23,814
Do you think we could
do it next Monday?

1692
01:10:23,883 --> 01:10:25,817
My week's filling up fast here.

1693
01:10:25,885 --> 01:10:29,184
When we got back
from the IHOP, it was 8:00.

1694
01:10:29,255 --> 01:10:30,688
Here comes your boyfriend.

1695
01:10:30,756 --> 01:10:33,316
Tai, check it out.

1696
01:10:33,392 --> 01:10:34,825
- Ew!
- Ew!

1697
01:10:34,894 --> 01:10:37,328
Hey, could you shove down
a little bit?

1698
01:10:37,396 --> 01:10:38,829
No.

1699
01:10:38,898 --> 01:10:40,331
Don't the slackers prefer

1700
01:10:40,399 --> 01:10:42,333
that grassy knoll over there?

1701
01:10:49,408 --> 01:10:54,004
Tai, so anyway,
have you ever done it in water?

1702
01:10:54,079 --> 01:10:55,512
- Oh, yeah.
- Really?

1703
01:10:55,581 --> 01:10:58,516
What was happening?

1704
01:10:58,584 --> 01:11:01,451
Dionne asking Tai for sex advice?

1705
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:05,047
Tai being the most popular girl
in the school?

1706
01:11:05,124 --> 01:11:07,991
It was like
some sort of alternate universe.

1707
01:11:09,428 --> 01:11:11,362
On top of everything else,

1708
01:11:11,430 --> 01:11:14,365
I was going to take the driving test,

1709
01:11:14,433 --> 01:11:17,698
so I had to find my most
responsible-looking ensemble.

1710
01:11:17,770 --> 01:11:22,400
Where's my white collarless shirt?

1711
01:11:22,474 --> 01:11:23,907
Lucy, where's my shirt?

1712
01:11:23,976 --> 01:11:25,409
Probably at the cleaner.

1713
01:11:25,477 --> 01:11:27,911
Oh, but today's the driving test.

1714
01:11:27,980 --> 01:11:30,414
It's my most capable-looking outfit.

1715
01:11:30,482 --> 01:11:32,382
O.K., I call them.

1716
01:11:32,451 --> 01:11:33,884
Oh, it's too late now.

1717
01:11:33,953 --> 01:11:36,888
Oh, we got another notice
from the fire department,

1718
01:11:36,956 --> 01:11:39,390
saying we have to
clear out the bush.

1719
01:11:39,458 --> 01:11:41,392
You said Jose would do it.

1720
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:43,394
He your gardener. You tell him.

1721
01:11:43,462 --> 01:11:44,895
Lucy, I don't speak Mexican.

1722
01:11:44,964 --> 01:11:46,397
I not a Mexican!

1723
01:11:46,465 --> 01:11:48,399
Great. What was that all about?

1724
01:11:48,467 --> 01:11:50,401
Lucy's from El Salvador.

1725
01:11:50,469 --> 01:11:51,834
So?

1726
01:11:51,904 --> 01:11:53,735
It's an entirely different country.

1727
01:11:53,806 --> 01:11:55,068
What does that matter?

1728
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:58,109
You get upset if someone
thinks you live below Sunset.

1729
01:11:58,177 --> 01:11:59,735
So everything is all my fault.

1730
01:11:59,812 --> 01:12:01,074
I'm always wrong, right?

1731
01:12:01,146 --> 01:12:02,477
You're such a brat.

1732
01:12:02,548 --> 01:12:04,914
I had an overwhelming sense of ickyness.

1733
01:12:04,984 --> 01:12:06,849
Even though I apologized to Lucy,

1734
01:12:06,919 --> 01:12:08,853
something was still plaguing me.

1735
01:12:11,056 --> 01:12:13,456
Like Josh thinking
I was mean was making me postal.

1736
01:12:13,525 --> 01:12:16,085
Move into the right lane.

1737
01:12:16,161 --> 01:12:18,356
Anyway, why should I care
what Josh thinks?

1738
01:12:18,430 --> 01:12:20,762
Why was I letting it throw me
into such turmoil?

1739
01:12:20,833 --> 01:12:22,528
Watch out for the bike rid...

1740
01:12:22,601 --> 01:12:24,034
Oops! My bad.

1741
01:12:24,103 --> 01:12:25,934
What are you doing?

1742
01:12:26,005 --> 01:12:28,439
You can't take up both lanes.

1743
01:12:28,507 --> 01:12:29,701
Get in the right lane.

1744
01:12:29,775 --> 01:12:32,039
Not so...

1745
01:12:32,111 --> 01:12:34,375
Ooh! Should I write them a note?

1746
01:12:34,446 --> 01:12:38,439
Pull over up here
and turn off the engine.

1747
01:12:38,517 --> 01:12:39,882
Right there.

1748
01:12:39,952 --> 01:12:42,113
Oh!

1749
01:12:42,187 --> 01:12:44,314
Are you going to take me somewhere

1750
01:12:44,390 --> 01:12:46,688
to make left-hand turns?

1751
01:12:46,759 --> 01:12:48,124
We're going back.

1752
01:12:48,193 --> 01:12:49,182
It's over?

1753
01:12:49,261 --> 01:12:51,126
It's over.

1754
01:12:51,196 --> 01:12:53,687
Well, how did I do?

1755
01:12:53,766 --> 01:12:56,894
How did you do?
Well, let's see, shall we?

1756
01:12:56,969 --> 01:12:59,403
You can't park,
you can't switch lanes,

1757
01:12:59,471 --> 01:13:01,234
you can't make
right-hand turns,

1758
01:13:01,306 --> 01:13:02,568
you've damaged private property,

1759
01:13:02,641 --> 01:13:04,074
and you almost killed someone.

1760
01:13:04,143 --> 01:13:06,373
Offhand, I'd say you failed.

1761
01:13:06,445 --> 01:13:07,844
Failed?

1762
01:13:07,913 --> 01:13:10,347
Well, can't we just start over?

1763
01:13:10,416 --> 01:13:12,850
I mean, I'm kind
of having a personal problem.

1764
01:13:12,918 --> 01:13:14,852
My mind was somewhere else.

1765
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:16,854
That biker came out of nowhere!

1766
01:13:16,922 --> 01:13:18,856
Oh! I swear I'll concentrate!

1767
01:13:18,924 --> 01:13:21,552
I drive really good, usually.

1768
01:13:21,627 --> 01:13:24,892
Isn't there somebody else
I can talk to?

1769
01:13:24,963 --> 01:13:27,363
You can't be
the absolute and final word

1770
01:13:27,433 --> 01:13:29,094
in driver's licenses.

1771
01:13:29,168 --> 01:13:31,602
Girlie, as far
as you're concerned,

1772
01:13:31,670 --> 01:13:34,571
I'm the messiah of the DMV.

1773
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:36,870
Now, get out of the car.

1774
01:13:50,956 --> 01:13:52,890
I can't believe I failed.

1775
01:13:52,958 --> 01:13:56,894
I failed something
I couldn't talk my way out of?

1776
01:14:00,599 --> 01:14:02,396
[Josh]
Go ahead, yeah.

1777
01:14:02,468 --> 01:14:04,402
Put your legs into me.

1778
01:14:04,470 --> 01:14:05,835
Hey, you're home.

1779
01:14:05,904 --> 01:14:08,771
How does it feel
to have a license?

1780
01:14:08,841 --> 01:14:11,571
I wouldn't know. I failed.

1781
01:14:11,643 --> 01:14:13,804
Oh. Bummer.

1782
01:14:13,879 --> 01:14:15,847
And, Josh, spare me your lectures

1783
01:14:15,914 --> 01:14:17,848
on how driving is
such a big responsibility

1784
01:14:17,916 --> 01:14:19,406
and you can't B.S.
your way through it.

1785
01:14:19,485 --> 01:14:21,646
I didn't say anything.

1786
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:23,051
I know what you're thinking.

1787
01:14:30,362 --> 01:14:32,796
I got to tell you something.

1788
01:14:32,865 --> 01:14:34,856
I'm really sorry about your test.

1789
01:14:34,933 --> 01:14:36,867
I am so glad you're here.

1790
01:14:36,935 --> 01:14:38,869
There's something I got to do.

1791
01:14:38,937 --> 01:14:41,371
I need you here. Does this work?

1792
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:43,374
Yeah. What is this stuff?

1793
01:14:43,442 --> 01:14:44,875
A bunch of junk

1794
01:14:44,943 --> 01:14:46,877
that reminded me of Elton.

1795
01:14:46,945 --> 01:14:50,381
I want to burn it
because I'm so over him.

1796
01:14:50,449 --> 01:14:51,882
What stuff?

1797
01:14:51,950 --> 01:14:55,386
Do you remember
when we were at the Val party

1798
01:14:55,454 --> 01:14:57,388
and the clog knocking me out

1799
01:14:57,456 --> 01:14:59,890
and Elton got a towel of ice?

1800
01:14:59,958 --> 01:15:02,392
I didn't tell you at the time,

1801
01:15:02,461 --> 01:15:04,895
but I took the towel as a souvenir.

1802
01:15:04,963 --> 01:15:06,328
You're kidding.

1803
01:15:06,398 --> 01:15:07,831
No.

1804
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:09,265
And then...

1805
01:15:09,334 --> 01:15:11,962
remember that song
that was playing when we danced?

1806
01:15:12,037 --> 01:15:13,265
Remember that?

1807
01:15:13,338 --> 01:15:16,205
You know, Rollin' With The Homies.

1808
01:15:16,275 --> 01:15:18,334
Anyways, I got the tape, right?

1809
01:15:18,410 --> 01:15:21,277
I listened to it, like,
every single night.

1810
01:15:21,346 --> 01:15:23,337
Don't burn that, O.K.?

1811
01:15:23,415 --> 01:15:27,181
Tai, I'm really happy for you,

1812
01:15:27,252 --> 01:15:29,846
but what brought on
this surge of empowerment?

1813
01:15:29,922 --> 01:15:32,857
It's, like, I met this guy

1814
01:15:32,925 --> 01:15:34,358
who's so totally amazing

1815
01:15:34,426 --> 01:15:37,190
that he makes Elton
look like a loser.

1816
01:15:37,262 --> 01:15:39,199
That is so great.

1817
01:15:39,332 --> 01:15:42,165
Look, you've got to
help me get Josh.

1818
01:15:42,235 --> 01:15:44,635
Get Josh what?

1819
01:15:44,704 --> 01:15:47,002
You know what I mean?

1820
01:15:47,073 --> 01:15:48,506
I like him.

1821
01:15:48,575 --> 01:15:50,975
Do you think
that he likes you?

1822
01:15:51,044 --> 01:15:51,976
Yeah.

1823
01:15:52,045 --> 01:15:53,478
How do you know?

1824
01:15:53,546 --> 01:15:55,480
Like, little things, you know?

1825
01:15:55,548 --> 01:15:57,880
Like, he always finds
some sort of way

1826
01:15:57,951 --> 01:16:00,215
to touch me or tickle me.

1827
01:16:00,286 --> 01:16:02,880
Do you remember
the time at the frat

1828
01:16:02,956 --> 01:16:04,890
when I was totally depressed?

1829
01:16:04,958 --> 01:16:07,688
We danced, and he was really flirty.

1830
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:09,887
You O.K.?

1831
01:16:09,963 --> 01:16:13,831
Yeah. Oh, actually...
I was really bad today.

1832
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:15,834
I had two mochaccinos.

1833
01:16:15,902 --> 01:16:17,335
I feel like ralphing.

1834
01:16:17,403 --> 01:16:19,837
I know exactly how that feels.

1835
01:16:19,906 --> 01:16:23,273
Like, the other day,
I was talking to Josh,

1836
01:16:23,343 --> 01:16:25,334
and we were discussing
the difference

1837
01:16:25,411 --> 01:16:27,345
between high school girls
and college girls.

1838
01:16:27,413 --> 01:16:29,847
College girls wear less makeup.

1839
01:16:29,916 --> 01:16:31,907
That's why guys like them more.

1840
01:16:31,985 --> 01:16:35,853
But, Tai, do you really think
you'd be good with Josh?

1841
01:16:35,922 --> 01:16:38,891
I mean, he's, like,
a school nerd.

1842
01:16:38,958 --> 01:16:41,586
Am I some sort of
a mentally challenged airhead?

1843
01:16:41,661 --> 01:16:43,094
No! Not even!

1844
01:16:43,162 --> 01:16:45,562
I didn't say that.

1845
01:16:45,632 --> 01:16:48,032
I'm not good enough
for Josh or something?

1846
01:16:48,101 --> 01:16:54,438
l... I just... don't think
you mesh well together.

1847
01:16:54,507 --> 01:16:57,067
You don't think
that we mesh well?

1848
01:16:57,143 --> 01:17:00,738
Why am I even listening to you
to begin with?

1849
01:17:00,813 --> 01:17:05,375
You're a virgin who can't drive.

1850
01:17:08,388 --> 01:17:11,721
Oh, that was way harsh, Tai.

1851
01:17:11,791 --> 01:17:14,817
All right. Look, I'm really sorry.

1852
01:17:14,894 --> 01:17:17,829
Let's just talk when
we've mellowed, all right?

1853
01:17:17,897 --> 01:17:19,330
I'm Audi.

1854
01:17:22,735 --> 01:17:24,828
What did I do?

1855
01:17:24,904 --> 01:17:27,839
I've created some sort of a monster.

1856
01:17:27,907 --> 01:17:32,844
I could feel the chunks
start to rise up in my throat.

1857
01:17:32,912 --> 01:17:35,278
I had to get out.

1858
01:17:37,183 --> 01:17:40,880
? When I was young?

1859
01:17:40,953 --> 01:17:44,946
? I never needed anyone?

1860
01:17:45,024 --> 01:17:48,460
Everything I think
and everything I do is wrong.

1861
01:17:48,528 --> 01:17:50,462
I was wrong about Elton.

1862
01:17:50,530 --> 01:17:51,861
I was wrong about Christian.

1863
01:17:51,931 --> 01:17:53,523
Now Josh hated me.

1864
01:17:53,599 --> 01:17:57,365
It all boiled down to
one inevitable conclusion...

1865
01:17:57,437 --> 01:17:59,871
I was just totally clueless.

1866
01:17:59,939 --> 01:18:02,874
Oh, and this Josh and Tai thing

1867
01:18:02,942 --> 01:18:04,876
was wiggin' me more than anything.

1868
01:18:04,944 --> 01:18:07,310
What was my problem? Tai is my pal.

1869
01:18:07,380 --> 01:18:09,314
I don't begrudge her a boyfriend.

1870
01:18:09,382 --> 01:18:10,815
I really... Ooh!

1871
01:18:10,883 --> 01:18:12,908
I wonder if they have that in my size.

1872
01:18:14,721 --> 01:18:17,315
What does she want with Josh anyway?

1873
01:18:17,390 --> 01:18:18,823
He dresses funny.

1874
01:18:18,891 --> 01:18:20,825
He listens to complaint rock.

1875
01:18:20,893 --> 01:18:24,522
He's not even cute...
in a conventional way.

1876
01:18:24,597 --> 01:18:28,795
I mean, he's just like this slug

1877
01:18:28,868 --> 01:18:31,462
who hangs around
the house all the time.

1878
01:18:31,537 --> 01:18:35,132
And he's a hideous dancer.

1879
01:18:35,208 --> 01:18:38,075
Couldn't take him anywhere.

1880
01:18:38,144 --> 01:18:41,079
Wait a second.
What am I stressing about?

1881
01:18:41,147 --> 01:18:43,081
This is, like, Josh.

1882
01:18:43,149 --> 01:18:47,176
? All by myself??

1883
01:18:47,253 --> 01:18:50,188
O.K., O.K.,
so he's kind of a Baldwin.

1884
01:18:50,256 --> 01:18:52,690
What would he want with Tai?

1885
01:18:52,759 --> 01:18:54,693
She couldn't make him happy.

1886
01:18:54,761 --> 01:18:56,695
Josh needs someone with imagination,

1887
01:18:56,763 --> 01:18:59,197
someone to take care of him,

1888
01:18:59,265 --> 01:19:01,699
someone to laugh at his jokes...

1889
01:19:01,768 --> 01:19:04,202
in case he ever makes any.

1890
01:19:04,270 --> 01:19:05,794
Then suddenly...

1891
01:19:05,872 --> 01:19:07,965
Oh, my God.

1892
01:19:09,876 --> 01:19:12,936
I love Josh.

1893
01:19:13,012 --> 01:19:17,847
I am majorly, totally,
crazy in love with Josh.

1894
01:19:17,917 --> 01:19:21,318
But now I don't know
how to act around him.

1895
01:19:21,387 --> 01:19:23,821
I mean, ordinarily,
I'd strut around him

1896
01:19:23,890 --> 01:19:25,323
in my cutest little outfits

1897
01:19:25,391 --> 01:19:27,325
and send myself flowers and candy,

1898
01:19:27,393 --> 01:19:30,328
but I couldn't do that stuff with Josh.

1899
01:19:30,396 --> 01:19:31,829
What's with you?

1900
01:19:31,898 --> 01:19:33,331
What do you mean?

1901
01:19:33,399 --> 01:19:34,832
You're so quiet.

1902
01:19:34,901 --> 01:19:37,335
You haven't made me
watch The Real World.

1903
01:19:37,403 --> 01:19:39,337
I care about the news.

1904
01:19:39,405 --> 01:19:40,497
Since when?

1905
01:19:40,573 --> 01:19:42,632
Since now.

1906
01:19:42,708 --> 01:19:44,903
...ln Central Bosnia.

1907
01:19:44,977 --> 01:19:47,844
You look confused.

1908
01:19:47,914 --> 01:19:52,351
Well, uh, I thought they
declared peace in the Middle East.

1909
01:20:02,328 --> 01:20:03,659
Cher, get in here!

1910
01:20:03,729 --> 01:20:05,128
What's up, Daddy?

1911
01:20:05,198 --> 01:20:06,995
What are you doing dancing
in front of my office?

1912
01:20:07,066 --> 01:20:09,500
Nothing. I just wanted to see

1913
01:20:09,569 --> 01:20:11,969
if you need any help with anything.

1914
01:20:12,038 --> 01:20:14,302
Yeah, you can help me
with something.

1915
01:20:14,373 --> 01:20:15,806
Come over here.

1916
01:20:17,376 --> 01:20:19,310
All right.

1917
01:20:19,378 --> 01:20:21,312
Every time that you see

1918
01:20:21,380 --> 01:20:22,813
a telephone conversation

1919
01:20:22,882 --> 01:20:27,717
that took place on September 3rd,
highlight it.

1920
01:20:27,787 --> 01:20:29,812
- Just September 3rd.
- O.K.

1921
01:20:32,892 --> 01:20:34,826
It's fun, huh?

1922
01:20:34,894 --> 01:20:36,327
Yeah.

1923
01:20:37,897 --> 01:20:39,626
O.K.

1924
01:20:39,699 --> 01:20:42,327
Daddy, did you ever have a problem

1925
01:20:42,401 --> 01:20:44,494
that you couldn't
argue your way out of?

1926
01:20:44,570 --> 01:20:47,266
Tell me the problem,
and we'll figure out how to argue it.

1927
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:51,299
I like this boy,
and he likes someone else.

1928
01:20:51,377 --> 01:20:53,038
How could that be?

1929
01:20:53,112 --> 01:20:55,342
I don't know. I feel wretched.

1930
01:20:55,414 --> 01:20:57,211
Obviously, this boy
is a complete moron.

1931
01:20:57,283 --> 01:21:01,549
You are the most beautiful girl
in Beverly Hills.

1932
01:21:01,621 --> 01:21:03,851
And to tell you the truth,

1933
01:21:03,923 --> 01:21:07,359
I'm not sure I want you
with a stupid fellow.

1934
01:21:07,426 --> 01:21:09,860
Well, actually, he is a smart guy.

1935
01:21:09,929 --> 01:21:12,363
He's one of those do-gooder types.

1936
01:21:12,431 --> 01:21:15,491
I feel like my after-school
commitments aren't good enough.

1937
01:21:15,568 --> 01:21:17,365
How can you say that?

1938
01:21:17,436 --> 01:21:19,870
Who takes care of everyone
in this household?

1939
01:21:19,939 --> 01:21:22,373
Who makes sure that
Daddy eats right?

1940
01:21:22,441 --> 01:21:26,673
I have not seen
such good-doing since your mother.

1941
01:21:26,746 --> 01:21:27,872
Really?

1942
01:21:27,947 --> 01:21:31,144
Really.

1943
01:21:31,217 --> 01:21:33,310
Now, get back to work.

1944
01:21:37,790 --> 01:21:41,385
Later, while we were learning
about the Pismo Beach disaster,

1945
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:44,395
I decided I needed
a complete makeover,

1946
01:21:44,463 --> 01:21:47,899
except this time,
I'd makeover my soul.

1947
01:21:47,967 --> 01:21:50,401
But what makes somebody
a better person?

1948
01:21:50,469 --> 01:21:54,906
Then I realized all my friends
were good in different ways.

1949
01:21:54,974 --> 01:21:56,908
Like Christian,
he always wants things

1950
01:21:56,976 --> 01:21:58,773
to be beautiful and interesting.

1951
01:21:58,844 --> 01:22:00,277
Or Dionne and Murray,

1952
01:22:00,346 --> 01:22:02,405
when they think no one is watching,

1953
01:22:02,481 --> 01:22:04,244
are so considerate of each other.

1954
01:22:04,317 --> 01:22:06,615
And poor Miss Geist,

1955
01:22:06,686 --> 01:22:08,847
always trying to get us involved

1956
01:22:08,921 --> 01:22:11,116
no matter how much we resist.

1957
01:22:11,190 --> 01:22:12,623
Oh. That's just...

1958
01:22:12,692 --> 01:22:14,353
That doesn't even show...

1959
01:22:14,427 --> 01:22:16,361
Every single possession,
every memory,

1960
01:22:16,429 --> 01:22:18,863
everything you've had
your whole life

1961
01:22:18,931 --> 01:22:20,364
gone in a second.

1962
01:22:20,433 --> 01:22:23,368
Can you imagine
what that must feel like?

1963
01:22:23,436 --> 01:22:24,869
Elton?

1964
01:22:24,937 --> 01:22:26,871
Can I use the pass?

1965
01:22:26,939 --> 01:22:29,874
Yeah. We'll be collecting blankets,
disposable diapers,

1966
01:22:29,942 --> 01:22:32,035
uh, canned goods.

1967
01:22:32,111 --> 01:22:33,373
Miss Geist?

1968
01:22:33,446 --> 01:22:34,879
Cher?

1969
01:22:34,947 --> 01:22:36,608
I want to help.

1970
01:22:36,682 --> 01:22:39,048
That would be wonderful.

1971
01:22:39,118 --> 01:22:40,710
I felt better already.

1972
01:22:43,956 --> 01:22:45,787
Daddy!

1973
01:22:45,858 --> 01:22:47,723
What?

1974
01:22:47,793 --> 01:22:49,454
You didn't like that
red caviar, did you?

1975
01:22:49,528 --> 01:22:51,723
What's she talking about?

1976
01:22:53,132 --> 01:22:54,394
Ew!

1977
01:23:04,810 --> 01:23:06,141
Cher, what are you doing?

1978
01:23:06,212 --> 01:23:10,512
I'm captain of the Pismo Beach
disaster relief.

1979
01:23:10,583 --> 01:23:12,210
I don't think
they need your skis.

1980
01:23:12,284 --> 01:23:14,844
Daddy, some people lost
all their belongings.

1981
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:17,252
Don't you think that includes
athletic equipment?

1982
01:23:17,323 --> 01:23:20,190
This is your influence, Josh?

1983
01:23:26,232 --> 01:23:29,827
? Shake, some action's what I need?

1984
01:23:29,902 --> 01:23:34,305
? To make a bus stop at full speed?

1985
01:23:34,373 --> 01:23:39,367
? And I'm sure that's all you'll need?

1986
01:23:39,445 --> 01:23:41,709
? To make it all right??

1987
01:23:41,781 --> 01:23:43,183
...Really fun.

1988
01:23:45,218 --> 01:23:46,651
It's so pretty.

1989
01:23:46,719 --> 01:23:48,653
Should I leave it here?

1990
01:23:48,721 --> 01:23:51,155
Could you bring it to bedding?

1991
01:23:51,224 --> 01:23:52,555
Thank you very much.

1992
01:23:54,127 --> 01:23:56,891
Oh, Miss Geist,
I need more boxes.

1993
01:23:56,963 --> 01:23:58,396
They're all filled up.

1994
01:23:58,464 --> 01:23:59,556
Already? Great.

1995
01:23:59,632 --> 01:24:02,567
I divided them into
entrees and appetizers.

1996
01:24:02,635 --> 01:24:05,661
Oh. O.K.
I'll have them picked up.

1997
01:24:08,074 --> 01:24:09,439
Uh!

1998
01:24:11,244 --> 01:24:12,370
Hey.

1999
01:24:12,445 --> 01:24:15,380
Proper. This is really decent
of you, Travis.

2000
01:24:15,448 --> 01:24:17,348
Sure.

2001
01:24:17,417 --> 01:24:19,476
I wasn't sure about that.

2002
01:24:19,552 --> 01:24:21,019
I don't need it anymore,

2003
01:24:21,087 --> 01:24:24,523
but far be it for me
to deny anyone else.

2004
01:24:24,591 --> 01:24:26,354
I'm sorry about your shoes.

2005
01:24:26,426 --> 01:24:27,518
What shoes?

2006
01:24:27,594 --> 01:24:29,994
The red ones with the strappy thing.

2007
01:24:30,063 --> 01:24:31,860
Oh, those are so last-season.

2008
01:24:31,931 --> 01:24:33,421
What made you think of them?

2009
01:24:33,499 --> 01:24:34,864
It's one of my steps.

2010
01:24:34,934 --> 01:24:38,893
I joined this club,
and there are these steps.

2011
01:24:38,972 --> 01:24:40,371
There's, like...

2012
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:41,532
12?

2013
01:24:41,608 --> 01:24:43,041
Yeah. How did you know?

2014
01:24:43,109 --> 01:24:44,041
Wild guess.

2015
01:24:44,110 --> 01:24:45,543
Wow. Good guess.

2016
01:24:45,612 --> 01:24:47,739
Uh, also, here.

2017
01:24:47,814 --> 01:24:49,372
ASL.

2018
01:24:49,449 --> 01:24:51,849
Amateur skateboarding league.

2019
01:24:51,918 --> 01:24:55,376
This clarity thing,
it's brought me to a whole new level.

2020
01:24:55,455 --> 01:24:57,047
My skating...
Would you come Saturday?

2021
01:24:57,123 --> 01:24:58,784
Sure.

2022
01:24:58,858 --> 01:25:00,018
Ah, cool.

2023
01:25:00,093 --> 01:25:01,390
Ha ha!

2024
01:25:01,461 --> 01:25:04,487
Well, um,
I guess kitchenware?

2025
01:25:04,564 --> 01:25:06,327
That's where I used to keep it.

2026
01:25:21,914 --> 01:25:23,347
Hi.

2027
01:25:23,416 --> 01:25:24,849
Hi.

2028
01:25:24,917 --> 01:25:27,351
Cher, can I talk
to you a minute?

2029
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:28,512
Um, sure.

2030
01:25:28,588 --> 01:25:31,352
Look, I have been in agony
for the past week.

2031
01:25:31,424 --> 01:25:34,018
I can't believe
I went off the way I did.

2032
01:25:34,093 --> 01:25:36,584
No. I have been going
down a shame spiral.

2033
01:25:36,663 --> 01:25:38,756
I can't believe
I was so unsupportive

2034
01:25:38,831 --> 01:25:40,355
of your feelings for Josh.

2035
01:25:40,433 --> 01:25:42,628
You're entitled to your opinion.

2036
01:25:42,702 --> 01:25:44,260
I'm the tard here.

2037
01:25:44,337 --> 01:25:47,067
Cher, you've been nothing
but super-duper nice to me.

2038
01:25:47,140 --> 01:25:50,576
If it wasn't for me,
you wouldn't have liked Elton.

2039
01:25:50,643 --> 01:25:52,577
I'm so sorry, Tai.

2040
01:25:52,645 --> 01:25:55,011
I'm really sorry.

2041
01:25:55,081 --> 01:25:58,278
Oh, shit. Now I'm going
to go ahead and cry.

2042
01:25:58,351 --> 01:26:00,478
Let's never fight again, O.K.?

2043
01:26:00,553 --> 01:26:03,545
Next up, number 14,
Travis Birkenstock.

2044
01:26:25,812 --> 01:26:28,042
Woo! All right, Travis!

2045
01:26:31,451 --> 01:26:34,386
I had no idea
he was so motivated.

2046
01:26:34,454 --> 01:26:37,787
Oh, I did.

2047
01:26:37,857 --> 01:26:39,791
When I saw the sparks
between Tai and Travis,

2048
01:26:39,859 --> 01:26:43,295
I knew Josh was
out of the picture.

2049
01:26:52,939 --> 01:26:54,873
You look like Pippi Longstocking.

2050
01:26:54,941 --> 01:26:56,875
You look like Forrest Gump.

2051
01:26:58,277 --> 01:26:59,869
Who's Pippi Longstocking?

2052
01:26:59,946 --> 01:27:02,881
Uh, someone Mel Gibson
never played.

2053
01:27:02,949 --> 01:27:04,940
You're funny.

2054
01:27:14,026 --> 01:27:15,357
What happened to
the August 28th files?

2055
01:27:15,428 --> 01:27:17,328
Hmm? What?

2056
01:27:17,397 --> 01:27:19,228
Mel wanted them tonight.
There were twice as many.

2057
01:27:19,298 --> 01:27:21,323
He's going to go ballistic.

2058
01:27:21,401 --> 01:27:23,164
Where are they?

2059
01:27:23,236 --> 01:27:24,828
I think I checked them

2060
01:27:24,904 --> 01:27:26,394
for the September 3rd
conversations.

2061
01:27:26,472 --> 01:27:28,337
What?

2062
01:27:28,408 --> 01:27:29,841
Where'd you put them?

2063
01:27:29,909 --> 01:27:31,843
I divided them
into two piles.

2064
01:27:31,911 --> 01:27:33,378
I have to redo all that.

2065
01:27:33,446 --> 01:27:34,674
Are you some kind of idiot?

2066
01:27:34,747 --> 01:27:36,339
Hey, she didn't know.

2067
01:27:36,416 --> 01:27:38,350
She just set us back a day.

2068
01:27:38,418 --> 01:27:40,045
Who cares about
the September call?

2069
01:27:40,119 --> 01:27:41,347
I'm sorry.

2070
01:27:41,421 --> 01:27:42,979
Just forget it.

2071
01:27:43,055 --> 01:27:45,489
Just go back to the mall
or something.

2072
01:27:46,926 --> 01:27:48,894
[Josh]
What's your problem, man?

2073
01:27:48,961 --> 01:27:51,122
She didn't mean any harm.

2074
01:27:51,197 --> 01:27:52,630
I'll get killed
'cause she's a moron.

2075
01:27:52,698 --> 01:27:53,687
She's not a moron.

2076
01:27:53,766 --> 01:27:55,358
If you were paying attention,

2077
01:27:55,435 --> 01:27:56,868
it wouldn't have happened.

2078
01:27:56,936 --> 01:27:58,369
If you hadn't have been
playing footsie,

2079
01:27:58,438 --> 01:27:59,962
she wouldn't be bothering me.

2080
01:28:00,039 --> 01:28:02,872
What the hell are you talking about?

2081
01:28:02,942 --> 01:28:05,308
This is a multimillion dollar lawsuit,

2082
01:28:05,378 --> 01:28:07,312
not some excuse for puppy love.

2083
01:28:07,380 --> 01:28:09,814
We've worked
our butts off on this case!

2084
01:28:09,882 --> 01:28:12,817
Do whatever you want
with your butts.

2085
01:28:12,885 --> 01:28:14,318
I'm calling in sick.

2086
01:28:19,459 --> 01:28:22,087
Did I really ruin
Daddy's lawsuit?

2087
01:28:22,161 --> 01:28:23,822
No.

2088
01:28:26,732 --> 01:28:28,165
Of course not.

2089
01:28:28,234 --> 01:28:30,327
Well, did I set him back?

2090
01:28:30,403 --> 01:28:32,837
I mean, there's
so much work to be done,

2091
01:28:32,905 --> 01:28:35,339
and he can't afford
to lose that time.

2092
01:28:35,408 --> 01:28:37,842
Don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

2093
01:28:37,910 --> 01:28:40,003
Your father won't lose any time.

2094
01:28:40,079 --> 01:28:43,014
Can you imagine
the nerve of that guy?

2095
01:28:43,082 --> 01:28:46,347
I mean, making
you worry like that.

2096
01:28:46,419 --> 01:28:49,354
He's the one that screwed up.

2097
01:28:49,422 --> 01:28:50,946
Then he goes and blames us.

2098
01:28:51,023 --> 01:28:52,854
Imagine saying we were...

2099
01:28:52,925 --> 01:28:56,486
you know.

2100
01:28:56,562 --> 01:29:00,191
That's right. You've been
very dedicated to this case.

2101
01:29:00,266 --> 01:29:02,359
Yeah. Well, it was
a good learning experience.

2102
01:29:02,435 --> 01:29:05,802
At least for me.
I want to be a lawyer.

2103
01:29:05,872 --> 01:29:09,808
But you, I mean,
you don't need to be doing this.

2104
01:29:09,876 --> 01:29:13,039
Go out and have fun.
Go shopping.

2105
01:29:14,881 --> 01:29:16,815
You think that's all I do?

2106
01:29:16,883 --> 01:29:19,317
I'm just a ditz
with a credit card?

2107
01:29:19,385 --> 01:29:20,352
No, no.

2108
01:29:20,419 --> 01:29:22,819
That's not what I meant.

2109
01:29:22,889 --> 01:29:25,323
It's just... um...

2110
01:29:25,391 --> 01:29:27,621
Uh, th...

2111
01:29:27,693 --> 01:29:30,821
You're... young

2112
01:29:30,897 --> 01:29:34,333
and beautiful and...

2113
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:36,095
And?

2114
01:29:36,168 --> 01:29:40,867
And, uh, well, what?

2115
01:29:40,940 --> 01:29:43,670
You think I'm beautiful?

2116
01:29:43,743 --> 01:29:46,837
Mmm... yeah, a little.

2117
01:29:46,913 --> 01:29:49,848
You know you're gorgeous,
all right?

2118
01:29:49,916 --> 01:29:54,853
And popular and, uh, and...

2119
01:29:54,921 --> 01:29:57,355
but this is not
why I come here.

2120
01:29:57,423 --> 01:30:01,154
This is a good
learning experience for me.

2121
01:30:01,227 --> 01:30:04,390
You already said that.

2122
01:30:04,463 --> 01:30:07,330
Mel. I want to help out Mel.

2123
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:09,891
He's the only one
who cares about me.

2124
01:30:09,969 --> 01:30:12,529
That's not true.

2125
01:30:12,605 --> 01:30:14,402
He's not?

2126
01:30:14,473 --> 01:30:16,998
No.

2127
01:30:17,076 --> 01:30:20,944
Are you saying...
you care about me?

2128
01:30:21,013 --> 01:30:23,311
Josh.

2129
01:30:39,899 --> 01:30:43,102
Well, you can guess
what happened next.

2130
01:30:43,235 --> 01:30:44,827
As if!

2131
01:30:44,903 --> 01:30:46,336
I am only 16.

2132
01:30:46,405 --> 01:30:48,805
This is California, not Kentucky.

2133
01:30:48,874 --> 01:30:50,842
You may kiss the bride.

2134
01:31:12,431 --> 01:31:15,366
I know that
when I have my own wedding,

2135
01:31:15,434 --> 01:31:18,369
I want this, like,
whole, entire floral motif,

2136
01:31:18,437 --> 01:31:19,870
like, very floral garlands.

2137
01:31:19,938 --> 01:31:21,371
No, no, no.

2138
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:24,375
When I get married,
I'll have a sailor dress,

2139
01:31:24,443 --> 01:31:26,377
but it will be a gown.

2140
01:31:26,445 --> 01:31:28,072
My bridesmaids
will wear sailor hats.

2141
01:31:28,147 --> 01:31:30,115
They're planning
our weddings already.

2142
01:31:30,182 --> 01:31:32,116
Could you all stop that

2143
01:31:32,184 --> 01:31:34,880
till death do us part
mumbo jumbo?

2144
01:31:34,953 --> 01:31:36,386
I'm completely buggin'.

2145
01:31:36,455 --> 01:31:37,820
I'm buggin' myself.

2146
01:31:37,890 --> 01:31:39,881
Girls, she's about
to throw the bouquet!

2147
01:31:39,958 --> 01:31:42,358
Come on!

2148
01:31:42,427 --> 01:31:45,885
We got a pool going to see
whose girl gets the bouquet.

2149
01:31:45,964 --> 01:31:47,397
It's up to $200.

2150
01:31:47,466 --> 01:31:48,899
It's in the bag.

2151
01:31:50,502 --> 01:31:52,595
All right, come on, girls.

2152
01:31:52,671 --> 01:31:56,937
Hey! Over here! Over here!

2153
01:32:08,220 --> 01:32:11,087
[General Public Singing Tenderness]

2154
01:32:23,135 --> 01:32:27,731
? Seems like without tenderness,
there's something missing?

2155
01:32:32,444 --> 01:32:34,378
? Tenderness?

2156
01:32:34,446 --> 01:32:36,380
- ? Where is the?
- ? Tenderness??

2157
01:32:36,448 --> 01:32:38,417
? Where is it? ...??

2158
01:34:27,925 --> 01:34:32,362
? If I could see?

2159
01:34:32,430 --> 01:34:35,763
? Into your heart?

2160
01:34:37,101 --> 01:34:41,299
? Then would I know?

2161
01:34:41,372 --> 01:34:46,241
? Just where to start?

2162
01:34:46,310 --> 01:34:49,871
? 'Cause I'm lost?

2163
01:34:49,947 --> 01:34:53,075
? And I need to be found?

2164
01:34:54,419 --> 01:34:58,617
? Crazy as it sounds?

2165
01:34:58,689 --> 01:35:01,886
? I need you around?

2166
01:35:03,494 --> 01:35:07,828
? If I could stand?

2167
01:35:07,899 --> 01:35:12,563
? To be on my own?

2168
01:35:12,637 --> 01:35:16,334
? Then I would probably?

2169
01:35:16,407 --> 01:35:21,208
? Just leave you alone?

2170
01:35:21,279 --> 01:35:29,812
? But I'm gonna feel this way
till I'm 6 feet underground?

2171
01:35:29,887 --> 01:35:33,948
? Crazy as it sounds?

2172
01:35:34,025 --> 01:35:37,688
? I need you around?

2173
01:35:41,265 --> 01:35:44,200
? Turning?

2174
01:35:45,603 --> 01:35:48,697
? Tossing and turning?

2175
01:35:50,875 --> 01:35:55,369
? My love is burning me down?

2176
01:35:56,647 --> 01:36:00,777
? If I could change?

2177
01:36:00,852 --> 01:36:05,255
? One thing in this world?

2178
01:36:05,323 --> 01:36:09,657
? I'd change your mind?

2179
01:36:09,727 --> 01:36:14,323
? And make you my girl?

2180
01:36:14,398 --> 01:36:22,931
? Because I'm lost,
and I need to be found?

2181
01:36:23,007 --> 01:36:27,000
? Crazy as it sounds?

2182
01:36:27,078 --> 01:36:31,344
? I need you around?

2183
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:57,905
? I'm gonna feel this way till
I'm 6 feet underground?

2184
01:36:57,975 --> 01:37:02,036
? Crazy as it sounds?

2185
01:37:02,113 --> 01:37:06,351
? I need you around??
