1
00:00:30,381 --> 00:00:33,548
<i>It all started 27 years ago.</i>

2
00:00:33,549 --> 00:00:35,244
<i>That's an orphanage.</i>

3
00:00:35,245 --> 00:00:38,828
<i>That's me in the basket.
I guess somebody didn't want me.</i>

4
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:41,293
<i>I hear they did want
the basket back, though.</i>

5
00:00:41,294 --> 00:00:43,245
<i>But it was fine in the orphanage.</i>

6
00:00:43,246 --> 00:00:45,357
<i>That's me in the third row.</i>

7
00:00:45,358 --> 00:00:47,085
<i>I wasn't very popular.</i>

8
00:00:47,086 --> 00:00:49,645
<i>Of course, everybody
wanted to be adopted.</i>

9
00:00:49,646 --> 00:00:51,725
<i>Luckily, lots of families came.</i>

10
00:00:51,726 --> 00:00:54,478
<i>And everybody got to go
live with a family.</i>

11
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:56,366
<i>Oh, except me.</i>

12
00:00:56,367 --> 00:00:58,733
<i>But I tried not to give up hope.</i>

13
00:00:58,734 --> 00:01:00,686
<i>Then, one day...</i>

14
00:01:00,687 --> 00:01:03,823
<i>something magical happened,
just like out of a fairy tale.</i>

15
00:01:03,824 --> 00:01:05,806
<i>Do you remember the one where
the wolf huffed and puffed...</i>

16
00:01:05,807 --> 00:01:07,503
<i>and blew the piggies' house down?</i>

17
00:01:07,504 --> 00:01:10,447
<i>And he was wearing a glass slipper,
I think, and he had a pumpkin?</i>

18
00:01:10,448 --> 00:01:12,303
<i>Plus there was that other thing?</i>

19
00:01:12,304 --> 00:01:14,607
<i>Well, the same thing happened to me...</i>

20
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:16,944
<i>only vastly different.</i>

21
00:01:16,945 --> 00:01:18,385
<i>I changed.</i>

22
00:01:18,386 --> 00:01:21,808
<i>And the next thing you know,
people seemed to like me for once.</i>

23
00:01:21,809 --> 00:01:24,176
<i>And then pictures were taken,
and suddenly I found the family...</i>

24
00:01:24,177 --> 00:01:26,184
<i>I always wanted.</i>

25
00:01:26,354 --> 00:01:29,584
<i>Oh, I forgot to tell you,
my name is Shelley.</i>

26
00:01:29,585 --> 00:01:31,761
<i>Now I live in the Playboy Mansion.</i>

27
00:01:31,762 --> 00:01:36,235
<i>And this is where I want to live
happily ever after.</i>

28
00:01:51,475 --> 00:01:56,079
- Throw the ball to me, Kim.
- Oh, nice catch. Awesome throw.

29
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,628
- Hey, Lauren.
- Hi, Shelley!

30
00:02:00,244 --> 00:02:01,746
Hi, Hef! Hi, girls!

31
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:04,332
Hi, Shelley. Looking good.

32
00:02:05,588 --> 00:02:07,924
- Marvin!
- Oh, hey, Shelley.

33
00:02:07,925 --> 00:02:09,300
Thank you.

34
00:02:09,301 --> 00:02:12,852
You guys have to try one of these.
Marvin makes the best margaritas.

35
00:02:12,853 --> 00:02:16,437
<i>That's 'cause they're mangoritas.
I invented them myself.</i>

36
00:02:16,438 --> 00:02:18,741
I added my own little Marvin twist to them.

37
00:02:18,742 --> 00:02:21,973
Well, you're the best twister I know.

38
00:02:21,974 --> 00:02:23,989
No, Shelley, you're the best twister.

39
00:02:24,024 --> 00:02:26,101
- Shelley.
- Hi!

40
00:02:26,102 --> 00:02:29,270
Why are you keeping the rich,
good-looking, famous guys all to yourself?

41
00:02:29,271 --> 00:02:31,414
- You should introduce me.
- Oh, of course.

42
00:02:31,415 --> 00:02:34,389
<i>Guys, this is Cassandra. She's
only been here for a few months,</i>

43
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,790
<i>but everybody loves her,
because she's super-beautiful...</i>

44
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:40,500
<i>and she never throws up
on anybody when she's drunk.</i>

45
00:02:41,367 --> 00:02:44,661
So, Shelley, are you a centerfold?

46
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:47,383
She wishes.

47
00:02:47,384 --> 00:02:50,871
Yeah, I do.
So keep all your fingers crossed.

48
00:02:50,872 --> 00:02:54,072
Hopefully Hef'll give me the good news
this weekend at my birthday party.

49
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:57,079
<i>I've got my "turn ons"
all ready and everything.</i>

50
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:02,001
Being a centerfold is the highest,
most prestigious honor there is.

51
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:05,911
<i>It says,
"I'm naked in the middle of a magazine.</i>

52
00:03:06,329 --> 00:03:08,152
<i>"Unfold me".</i>

53
00:03:08,153 --> 00:03:10,873
I gotta tell you, it seems
you've got a pretty good life here.

54
00:03:10,874 --> 00:03:12,890
<i>H, it's paradise.</i>

55
00:03:12,891 --> 00:03:16,403
We are just one big family.
I'm so happy.

56
00:03:16,602 --> 00:03:19,700
Why would I wanna live anywhere else?

57
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,270
<i>I love this one. Don't you guys?</i>

58
00:04:06,271 --> 00:04:09,982
We'll put this on the Mansion tab
and have it all sent over this afternoon.

59
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:13,086
<i>Aren't we just the luckiest girls
in the whole world?</i>

60
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:15,258
Yes, you are.

61
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,919
<i>Your birthday party on Friday's
gonna be so much fun!</i>

62
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,943
Shelley!

63
00:04:18,944 --> 00:04:22,522
Oh, my God.
I bet you're gonna get Miss November.

64
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,124
Good morning, Shelley.

65
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:31,645
Rise and shine, sweetheart.

66
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:35,844
Good morning, Marvin.

67
00:05:36,358 --> 00:05:40,034
Good morning, Pooter.
You're looking dapper.

68
00:05:41,062 --> 00:05:43,526
Your blueberry French toast is ready.

69
00:05:43,527 --> 00:05:44,871
<i>Ooh-la-la.</i>

70
00:05:44,872 --> 00:05:46,117
<i>That's French, right?</i>

71
00:05:46,118 --> 00:05:47,878
Yeah, but more important
than the food...

72
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:50,183
I actually added something
to your orange juice.

73
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:53,447
Oh, Marvin,
thank you so much for telling me.

74
00:05:53,448 --> 00:05:55,655
<i>Usually I don't find out
until much later.</i>

75
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:59,079
Oh, no. To add zest to the drink,
first I put in some vanilla extract...

76
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,016
then, of course, some egg yolks,
and then, I have a secret ingredient.

77
00:06:03,017 --> 00:06:05,544
<i>All right, you twisted my arm,
it's chili powder.</i>

78
00:06:05,545 --> 00:06:10,440
Yeah. It just explodes your taste buds,
so the drink just envelops your mouth.

79
00:06:10,441 --> 00:06:13,409
Oh, I love having my mouth enveloped.

80
00:06:13,513 --> 00:06:15,368
<i>What's that?</i>

81
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,920
Is this from Hef?
Is this my birthday gift?

82
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:21,833
Oh, Pooter, is it finally happening?
Am I Miss November?

83
00:06:21,834 --> 00:06:24,298
<i>That's what I wished for
when I blew out my candle.</i>

84
00:06:24,299 --> 00:06:26,794
<i>Oh, my gosh, I just told you my wish.
Now it won't come true.</i>

85
00:06:26,795 --> 00:06:29,546
<i>I'm so sorry. I didn't mean
to tell it just came out.</i>

86
00:06:29,547 --> 00:06:32,001
<i>My teeth couldn't stop it.</i>

87
00:06:32,042 --> 00:06:35,141
I take it all back, I take it all back.

88
00:06:35,787 --> 00:06:37,827
<i>Okay, I'm ready.</i>

89
00:06:40,587 --> 00:06:43,115
<i>"Dear Shelley.. ". h,
my gosh, that's me.</i>

90
00:06:43,116 --> 00:06:45,254
<i>Wait, there's more.</i>

91
00:06:45,484 --> 00:06:48,833
<i>"Please move out
of the Mansion immediately".</i>

92
00:06:52,941 --> 00:06:54,730
Move out?

93
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:03,177
<i>"You have two hours to collect
your belongings and leave the premises.</i>

94
00:07:04,014 --> 00:07:06,883
<i>"All my love, Hef".</i>

95
00:07:08,526 --> 00:07:10,728
<i>Hef's kicking me out?</i>

96
00:07:11,182 --> 00:07:13,197
Why would he do that?

97
00:07:13,198 --> 00:07:16,231
This is my home. This is my family.

98
00:07:16,783 --> 00:07:21,006
<i>I hate to say this, Shelley,
but maybe it's because of your age.</i>

99
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:23,150
<i>But I'm 27.</i>

100
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:26,631
<i>Yeah, but that's 59 in Bunny years.</i>

101
00:07:26,992 --> 00:07:31,471
But I just turned 27 last night.

102
00:07:31,472 --> 00:07:34,094
<i>It's almost like I'm still 26.</i>

103
00:07:34,095 --> 00:07:35,688
R 58.

104
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,531
I've gotta talk to Hef,
maybe he'll let me stay.

105
00:07:39,729 --> 00:07:41,296
Hef!

106
00:07:41,297 --> 00:07:42,921
Hef!

107
00:07:42,992 --> 00:07:44,487
Hef!

108
00:07:44,656 --> 00:07:46,151
Hef!

109
00:07:47,857 --> 00:07:49,360
Where is he?

110
00:07:49,361 --> 00:07:54,096
<i>He left for Vegas, Shelley,
I don't think he's that good with goodbyes.</i>

111
00:07:55,281 --> 00:07:57,834
Why is this all happening?

112
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:01,393
<i>Where's my pink Prius?</i>

113
00:08:01,651 --> 00:08:06,767
The Prius actually belongs to the company.
This is the car you came here with.

114
00:08:07,282 --> 00:08:09,006
But...

115
00:08:14,324 --> 00:08:15,858
Come on, Pooter.

116
00:08:15,859 --> 00:08:18,227
We have to go find a new place to live.

117
00:08:18,228 --> 00:08:19,699
Come on, now.

118
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,715
Come here, Pooter.

119
00:08:21,716 --> 00:08:24,723
<i>Here, let me help, Shelley.
Hey, Pooter. Shelley's calling you now.</i>

120
00:08:24,724 --> 00:08:27,507
Come on, Pooter.
Go with Shelley, buddy. Pooter!

121
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:30,705
That hurts! Go with Shelley, Pooter!

122
00:08:32,661 --> 00:08:34,385
Damn it!

123
00:08:39,605 --> 00:08:43,253
<i>Why don't I just keep him here
for a little while, until he calms down?</i>

124
00:08:43,254 --> 00:08:44,789
Okay.

125
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,483
<i>Well, don't worry, Pooter.</i>

126
00:08:46,518 --> 00:08:49,333
<i>I'm gonna find us
a really nice place to live,</i>

127
00:08:49,334 --> 00:08:51,478
and then maybe you'll wanna
come live with me.

128
00:08:51,479 --> 00:08:52,886
<i>I'm sure he will.</i>

129
00:08:52,887 --> 00:08:55,822
Well, you take care, Shelley.

130
00:09:06,456 --> 00:09:07,983
Bye.

131
00:09:16,761 --> 00:09:19,255
<i>I know it's an embarrassment
to live in a beat-up car,</i>

132
00:09:19,256 --> 00:09:20,952
<i>but don't lose faith, Pooter.</i>

133
00:09:20,953 --> 00:09:22,488
<i>I'm gonna get a great job soon...</i>

134
00:09:22,489 --> 00:09:26,041
and find us a super place to live,
with a new family.

135
00:09:26,042 --> 00:09:28,431
I pinkie promise, Pooter.

136
00:09:38,298 --> 00:09:40,468
Good evening, ma'am.

137
00:09:40,826 --> 00:09:44,535
<i>You violated Code 753.
That's unlawful spitting.</i>

138
00:09:44,858 --> 00:09:46,619
I was just brushing my teeth.

139
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,987
You currently residing in this car,
ma'am?

140
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:51,226
<i>I'm gonna have to issue
another ticket.</i>

141
00:09:51,227 --> 00:09:54,810
Would you maybe stop giving me tickets if I
told you I was having a really bad week...

142
00:09:54,811 --> 00:09:57,371
because I used to be a Playboy Bunny,
but I got kicked out of the Mansion...

143
00:09:57,372 --> 00:10:00,056
<i>because I'm 59 years old?</i>

144
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:05,308
<i>I'm gonna have to ask you to step out
of the car and take a Breathalyzer.</i>

145
00:10:05,309 --> 00:10:06,836
Okay.

146
00:10:10,685 --> 00:10:11,740
Noises.

147
00:10:11,741 --> 00:10:14,428
<i>I'm gonna need you to blow on this.</i>

148
00:10:14,429 --> 00:10:16,021
Really?

149
00:10:17,022 --> 00:10:19,476
I guess.

150
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:26,301
You tried to do what?

151
00:10:26,302 --> 00:10:27,992
To a cop?

152
00:10:30,175 --> 00:10:31,614
Stupid!

153
00:10:31,615 --> 00:10:33,694
I was just doing what he said.

154
00:10:33,695 --> 00:10:35,454
He was in a uniform and everything.

155
00:10:35,455 --> 00:10:38,238
<i>Don't worry, sweetie.
First-timers only get one night.</i>

156
00:10:38,239 --> 00:10:40,511
You'll be back on the street
selling in no time.

157
00:10:40,512 --> 00:10:44,373
<i>But I'm not a prostitute.
I was just brushing my teeth.</i>

158
00:10:48,673 --> 00:10:50,876
I like your tights.

159
00:10:51,905 --> 00:10:56,384
And, you know, you should really
go for a more natural look.

160
00:10:56,385 --> 00:10:59,648
All that heavy makeup
just hides your beauty.

161
00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:01,470
<i>I'm a dude.</i>

162
00:11:01,698 --> 00:11:04,731
Oh, well, you're good like that.

163
00:11:46,757 --> 00:11:48,740
So, did you hear
about the pool party at Jordan's?

164
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:50,373
It was unbelievable.

165
00:11:50,374 --> 00:11:51,716
- Oh, last Saturday?
- Yes.

166
00:11:51,717 --> 00:11:54,820
<i>- Oh, my God. He makes the best margaritas.
- Yep. It's because he uses mangos.</i>

167
00:11:54,821 --> 00:11:57,030
- No. Really?
- He read about them somewhere.

168
00:11:57,065 --> 00:11:58,117
Yeah, mangoritas.

169
00:11:58,118 --> 00:11:59,973
<i>- Jordan's just so hot.
- I know.</i>

170
00:11:59,974 --> 00:12:01,061
So are all his friends.

171
00:12:01,062 --> 00:12:03,558
Yeah, seriously,
I've tried to hook up with all of them.

172
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:06,559
- No, you have not.
- Yes. Yes, I did.

173
00:12:07,175 --> 00:12:08,711
Two of them, I succeeded.

174
00:12:08,712 --> 00:12:10,693
- Really?
- It was amazing.

175
00:12:10,694 --> 00:12:12,134
Who knew?

176
00:12:12,135 --> 00:12:14,590
I was so excited.

177
00:12:20,776 --> 00:12:23,645
Looks like a mini-Playboy Mansion.

178
00:12:36,969 --> 00:12:39,042
- Hi.
- Hi.

179
00:12:41,322 --> 00:12:42,783
Hi.

180
00:12:43,274 --> 00:12:45,248
Can I help you?

181
00:12:45,386 --> 00:12:47,785
Yes. I would like to live here,
please.

182
00:12:47,786 --> 00:12:51,594
Oh, I know, right?
But you have to be asked to live here.

183
00:12:51,595 --> 00:12:55,271
- Do you go to this school?
- This is a school?

184
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:57,894
Where are the desks?

185
00:12:58,219 --> 00:13:01,867
No...
This is a sorority house at a school.

186
00:13:01,868 --> 00:13:04,874
And you do look like an older...

187
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:07,723
sluttier version of the type of girl
we would want.

188
00:13:07,724 --> 00:13:11,468
<i>But, I'm sorry, you're not a student.
It was so nice talking to you.</i>

189
00:13:11,469 --> 00:13:14,369
- But I really think it's...
- So nice.

190
00:13:16,877 --> 00:13:20,908
And our piano is from Tuscany.
Very high-end.

191
00:13:20,909 --> 00:13:23,789
I believe that every detail
of the house...

192
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:26,477
should be a reflection
of the girls who live here.

193
00:13:26,512 --> 00:13:29,676
Hi...
Do you ladies go to school here, too?

194
00:13:29,677 --> 00:13:31,718
Not anymore.

195
00:13:31,918 --> 00:13:34,862
We're the housemothers
of the sororities on campus.

196
00:13:34,863 --> 00:13:36,333
<i>That's so dope.</i>

197
00:13:36,334 --> 00:13:38,862
Do you live in the houses
with the girls?

198
00:13:38,863 --> 00:13:40,174
Yes.

199
00:13:40,175 --> 00:13:42,542
<i>That's even dopier.</i>

200
00:13:42,767 --> 00:13:44,463
So, what do housemothers do?

201
00:13:44,464 --> 00:13:46,030
We oversee the meal plans,

202
00:13:46,031 --> 00:13:49,423
chaperone the social events,
make sure the girls stay out of trouble.

203
00:13:49,424 --> 00:13:52,943
<i>Oh, my gosh. That's exactly
what I used to do back at the Mansion.</i>

204
00:13:52,944 --> 00:13:54,351
Can I be one, too?

205
00:13:54,352 --> 00:13:58,351
<i>I'm sorry. This is a sorority,
not a brothel.</i>

206
00:13:58,352 --> 00:14:01,136
<i>A brothel?
Oh, I'm not looking to make soup.</i>

207
00:14:01,137 --> 00:14:02,992
<i>I'm looking to be like you.</i>

208
00:14:02,993 --> 00:14:05,360
I wanna be a housemother.

209
00:14:05,361 --> 00:14:07,183
We have standards.

210
00:14:07,184 --> 00:14:11,887
Standards that you clearly do not meet.
But it was nice to meet you.

211
00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:12,944
But I just want to...

212
00:14:12,945 --> 00:14:14,505
- So nice.
- So nice.

213
00:14:23,058 --> 00:14:27,026
Try Zeta. Their last housemother was
hospitalized with hallucinations.

214
00:14:27,027 --> 00:14:28,749
Awesome.

215
00:14:29,843 --> 00:14:31,632
Awesome.

216
00:14:45,364 --> 00:14:46,989
Hello?

217
00:14:53,108 --> 00:14:57,582
Dean Simmons. Please, please.
We are trying so hard. I promise you.

218
00:14:57,653 --> 00:14:59,797
<i>This seems really unfair.
And I'm not gonna attack you.</i>

219
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:02,516
I don't want you to feel attacked by
all of us, so I'm just gonna say me.

220
00:15:02,517 --> 00:15:05,172
To me, this feels really unfair.

221
00:15:05,173 --> 00:15:08,565
Natalie. Look,
I feel the same way you do.

222
00:15:08,566 --> 00:15:09,717
But the fact remains...

223
00:15:09,718 --> 00:15:13,269
you guys have not met your requirements
for three years running now.

224
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:16,310
<i>And I'm under a lot of pressure
from other sororities...</i>

225
00:15:16,311 --> 00:15:18,454
complaining that we're bending
the rules for you.

226
00:15:18,455 --> 00:15:21,749
<i>By "other sororities",
do you happen to mean Phi lota Mu?</i>

227
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,854
<i>I really don't think
it matters who complained.</i>

228
00:15:24,855 --> 00:15:28,085
Natalie, rules are rules.

229
00:15:32,311 --> 00:15:34,220
Drama queen.

230
00:15:34,327 --> 00:15:36,407
<i>Oh, I'm sorry I scared you.</i>

231
00:15:36,408 --> 00:15:38,775
Do you think you could help me
out of here, though?

232
00:15:38,776 --> 00:15:40,718
What? Yeah.

233
00:15:41,145 --> 00:15:42,201
Thanks.

234
00:15:42,202 --> 00:15:44,376
<i>I'm so sorry,
I think I broke your Z.</i>

235
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:48,088
Oh. No, it's okay. It falls off, like,
every time we open the door.

236
00:15:48,089 --> 00:15:51,122
Well, at least you still have T and A.

237
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:53,649
T and an A. Who are you?

238
00:15:56,474 --> 00:16:00,303
<i>My name is Shelley,
and I'm here to be your housemother.</i>

239
00:16:01,883 --> 00:16:05,176
<i>Well, it's nice to meet you, Shelley.</i>

240
00:16:05,722 --> 00:16:08,057
But, unfortunately, he...

241
00:16:09,531 --> 00:16:11,322
<i>It's a little too late.</i>

242
00:16:11,323 --> 00:16:14,907
<i>We're about to lose our charter,
so if we don't have a house...</i>

243
00:16:14,908 --> 00:16:17,459
<i>we won't really be needing
a housemother.</i>

244
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:21,234
Well, why are they gonna
take your house away?

245
00:16:21,917 --> 00:16:27,259
Because we get no pledges,
and everyone kind of thinks we're losers.

246
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:31,196
<i>That's so sad. Why does everyone
else get all the pledges?</i>

247
00:16:31,197 --> 00:16:34,295
Well, they have great parties, and...

248
00:16:34,302 --> 00:16:37,399
boys actually like them.

249
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:41,053
<i>I'm an expert at parties and boys.
I'm a Bunny.</i>

250
00:16:41,054 --> 00:16:43,485
Men write to me from prison,
sometimes in their own blood.

251
00:16:43,486 --> 00:16:45,341
<i>I mean, I assume it's theirs, who knows?
I don't.</i>

252
00:16:45,342 --> 00:16:46,493
<i>I'm sorry, I'm nervous right now...</i>

253
00:16:46,494 --> 00:16:49,213
because I really wanna help you guys,
because I know I can do it.

254
00:16:49,214 --> 00:16:51,582
Wow, a Bunny?

255
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:53,438
Like a centerfold?

256
00:16:53,439 --> 00:16:58,365
Oh, bless your heart, no.
Just a couple of small pictorials...

257
00:16:58,366 --> 00:17:02,938
<i>"Girls of the Midwest," "Girls with GEDs",
"Girls of Charlie Sheen".</i>

258
00:17:03,296 --> 00:17:05,947
<i>But now I'm a homeless person.</i>

259
00:17:06,528 --> 00:17:08,731
<i>God, I'm so sorry.</i>

260
00:17:08,896 --> 00:17:10,079
Good luck.

261
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:13,081
Wait, but I can really help you guys.

262
00:17:14,496 --> 00:17:16,447
<i>So if we don't get pledges,
we lose our charter?</i>

263
00:17:16,448 --> 00:17:19,487
<i>- We need 30.
- Thirty pledges? There's seven of us, dude.</i>

264
00:17:19,488 --> 00:17:21,855
<i>Technically, 71l2 now.</i>

265
00:17:21,856 --> 00:17:23,008
Hey!

266
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:26,686
<i>Oh, nothing a little fertilizer
can't help.</i>

267
00:17:28,002 --> 00:17:30,785
Not you, Tanya.
I was talking about Harmony.

268
00:17:30,786 --> 00:17:34,233
<i>Actually, 73l4 as of Tuesday
last week.</i>

269
00:17:34,466 --> 00:17:36,546
Guys, we're never gonna get
that many pledges.

270
00:17:36,547 --> 00:17:40,060
This is just their way
of shutting us down.

271
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:42,081
This is awful.

272
00:17:42,082 --> 00:17:44,098
Hey, Joanne, just FYI...

273
00:17:44,099 --> 00:17:47,203
you've got refrigerator magnets
stuck to your brace again.

274
00:17:47,238 --> 00:17:48,546
<i>Actually, we need that.
That's our grocery list.</i>

275
00:17:48,547 --> 00:17:50,659
I knew that. I knew that.

276
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:53,342
- No, you didn't.
- Did so.

277
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:56,478
- Why do we need knee-highs?
- Oh, my God.

278
00:17:57,604 --> 00:18:00,637
<i>Oh, my God.
There's boys on our lawn.</i>

279
00:18:02,468 --> 00:18:04,067
Are they lost?

280
00:18:04,068 --> 00:18:05,595
Nice.

281
00:18:05,828 --> 00:18:09,505
<i>The Leaning Panther. I like that.
Yoga's hot.</i>

282
00:18:10,373 --> 00:18:12,510
So, are you a Zeta?

283
00:18:12,581 --> 00:18:14,949
Oh, I wish.

284
00:18:15,269 --> 00:18:20,605
Yeah, I do, too, because Zeta would be
my new favorite hizzety-hang.

285
00:18:20,838 --> 00:18:23,456
Well, she is not a Zeta...

286
00:18:23,782 --> 00:18:27,012
<i>because she's our new
hizzety-housemother.</i>

287
00:18:27,431 --> 00:18:29,766
She'll be hizzy-tizzies...

288
00:18:29,767 --> 00:18:32,352
She'll be here all the time.

289
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:34,816
You're hiring me?

290
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:37,212
Oh, give me some of that.

291
00:18:37,671 --> 00:18:39,842
Oh, God bless her.

292
00:18:40,072 --> 00:18:43,073
- Why are they acting like that?
- Yes.

293
00:18:43,528 --> 00:18:47,553
<i>Oh, that's boys just being boys.</i>

294
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:49,727
Thank goodness.

295
00:18:54,505 --> 00:18:58,792
Oh, my gosh! I am just so happy
that you guys want me here.

296
00:18:58,793 --> 00:19:00,777
You are not gonna be sorry.

297
00:19:00,778 --> 00:19:03,145
So this is how we're gonna get pledges?

298
00:19:03,146 --> 00:19:07,241
Hiring an archaically superficial
reflection of the male fantasy?

299
00:19:07,242 --> 00:19:09,481
Well, guys like her.

300
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:14,282
<i>And since guys don't like us,
I figured she could help.</i>

301
00:19:14,283 --> 00:19:19,178
So, in order to be in a sisterhood,
now we have to be popular?

302
00:19:19,179 --> 00:19:23,723
No, no. In order to keep our house,
though, we do have to be popular. Yes.

303
00:19:23,724 --> 00:19:26,827
So, I figured Shelley here could
teach us how.

304
00:19:26,828 --> 00:19:29,835
<i>Okay, look, don't get me wrong.
I love guys.</i>

305
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:32,619
But I lived in a house
filled with girls for nine years,

306
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:37,388
<i>and I know that there's nothing better
than just being with your sisters...</i>

307
00:19:37,389 --> 00:19:42,058
<i>sharing, talking all night,
painting each other's bodies...</i>

308
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:46,145
baking penis cookies,
playing with monkeys...

309
00:19:46,414 --> 00:19:49,610
<i>- Where'd you live?
- The Playboy Mansion.</i>

310
00:19:55,182 --> 00:19:59,045
<i>No, that doesn't make her a hooker. Sorry.</i>

311
00:20:03,247 --> 00:20:05,902
<i>She's shy. She's just...</i>

312
00:20:05,903 --> 00:20:09,647
<i>She's so shy. That's Lilly,
also, by the way.</i>

313
00:20:09,648 --> 00:20:11,239
Lilly.

314
00:20:12,271 --> 00:20:15,119
And this here is Harmony.

315
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,844
Harmony.

316
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:21,327
And Carrie Mae.

317
00:20:21,328 --> 00:20:22,799
Carrie Mae.

318
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,520
And then Joanne, over there.

319
00:20:25,521 --> 00:20:27,277
Joanne.

320
00:20:28,049 --> 00:20:31,440
<i>Wow, you hired the Exorcist.
That's great.</i>

321
00:20:31,441 --> 00:20:33,040
What is that?

322
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:35,888
Is that like a Yoda thing, or what?

323
00:20:35,986 --> 00:20:38,001
<i>It's fun, but, what...</i>

324
00:20:38,002 --> 00:20:42,353
<i>h, no, no. It's just this thing I do
to remember people's names.</i>

325
00:20:42,354 --> 00:20:43,409
Natalie.

326
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:47,752
So, thank you guys so much
for letting me be your housemother.

327
00:20:48,082 --> 00:20:50,318
<i>No, it's no problem.</i>

328
00:20:51,571 --> 00:20:53,740
Because you just...

329
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,794
This is just gonna be great.

330
00:20:55,795 --> 00:20:56,914
But I have to go take a shower...

331
00:20:56,915 --> 00:21:00,114
<i>because I haven't had one since I slept
in my car and spent the night in jail.</i>

332
00:21:00,115 --> 00:21:01,708
Sweet.

333
00:21:03,443 --> 00:21:05,747
- Hi, girls.
- Oh, my God!

334
00:21:05,748 --> 00:21:07,955
<i>Shelley! Hi. Where's your robe?</i>

335
00:21:07,956 --> 00:21:09,619
Oh, I just like to air dry.

336
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,764
Oh, she just likes to air dry.

337
00:21:11,765 --> 00:21:13,684
My God, you're so vapid.

338
00:21:13,685 --> 00:21:15,475
Oh, my gosh. Thank you so much.

339
00:21:15,476 --> 00:21:18,324
<i>You're like the hundredth person
who's told me that.</i>

340
00:21:18,325 --> 00:21:22,452
Shell? Just a quick little side note...

341
00:21:22,453 --> 00:21:23,893
<i>I don't think that some
of the girls in this house...</i>

342
00:21:23,894 --> 00:21:25,780
have even seen their own bodies naked...

343
00:21:25,781 --> 00:21:30,037
<i>so they probably don't really want
to see your perfectly engineered boobs.</i>

344
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:35,025
<i>Well, I'm just walking around
in the body God and Dr. Borkman gave me.</i>

345
00:21:38,454 --> 00:21:40,502
<i>Hey, Shelley, why don't you throw
some clothes on?</i>

346
00:21:40,503 --> 00:21:43,219
We've got a lot of work to do.

347
00:21:43,448 --> 00:21:46,518
This year, we are gonna get
lots and lots of pledges.

348
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:47,798
Okay.

349
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:51,127
Oh, we also need to raise money
for our philanthropy.

350
00:21:51,128 --> 00:21:53,430
<i>What's a phila-canopee?</i>

351
00:21:53,592 --> 00:21:57,039
<i>Oh, no. It's a philanthropy.</i>

352
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,358
<i>It's like a charity.</i>

353
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:00,951
Oh, I love charity.

354
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:01,976
Ne time, at the Mansion...

355
00:22:01,977 --> 00:22:05,872
I even let Bob Saget grind on me
during a slow dance.

356
00:22:08,409 --> 00:22:10,872
<i>And here's a list of ideas
I came up with for fundraisers...</i>

357
00:22:10,873 --> 00:22:13,112
that might make us
a little more popular.

358
00:22:13,113 --> 00:22:17,209
So, please take a read.

359
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,417
<i>"Start a beekeeping club".</i>

360
00:22:19,418 --> 00:22:22,036
We could have the masks, even.

361
00:22:23,546 --> 00:22:25,882
<i>"Paleolithic bake sale".</i>

362
00:22:25,883 --> 00:22:29,657
<i>Hi! Dinosaurs!
Like, everyone saw Jurassic Park.</i>

363
00:22:30,747 --> 00:22:32,538
<i>"B. Y... M".</i>

364
00:22:32,539 --> 00:22:33,786
Bring your own man?

365
00:22:33,787 --> 00:22:36,688
No. Bring your own mouse!

366
00:22:37,084 --> 00:22:38,299
Which is better.

367
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,762
Because they're cute and they're little
and you can hold them.

368
00:22:40,763 --> 00:22:45,307
And also, another thing that
I thought of was, you could dress them up.

369
00:22:45,308 --> 00:22:48,156
<i>It's the whole fun part of it,
is you can put them in little outfits.</i>

370
00:22:48,157 --> 00:22:50,555
You can make, like,
an Abraham Lincoln mouse.

371
00:22:50,556 --> 00:22:52,731
And you could do like Joan of...

372
00:22:52,732 --> 00:22:55,932
<i>Why do everyone's eyes glaze over
when I talk about this?</i>

373
00:22:55,933 --> 00:22:57,565
Whoa. No.

374
00:22:57,566 --> 00:23:01,427
<i>No, they weren't glazing.
They were just taking a break.</i>

375
00:23:01,661 --> 00:23:04,668
Natalie, these are super,
super-great ideas.

376
00:23:04,669 --> 00:23:07,101
Thank you. I worked really hard.

377
00:23:07,102 --> 00:23:10,844
But we might wanna try
something a little more...

378
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:12,340
sexy.

379
00:23:13,343 --> 00:23:17,271
Car wash. Come get your car washed.

380
00:23:17,342 --> 00:23:20,415
Here we are at the Zeta House Car Wash.

381
00:23:20,416 --> 00:23:23,742
<i>I have a car,
and I'm great at washing it.</i>

382
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:27,191
I am so offended right now.

383
00:23:27,295 --> 00:23:29,279
<i>Come on, guys,
let's give her a chance.</i>

384
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,615
- Car wash.
- Car wash!

385
00:23:31,616 --> 00:23:33,695
You said you needed to raise money.

386
00:23:33,696 --> 00:23:39,228
Well, washing cars is a fun and sexy way
to make all the money that we need.

387
00:23:39,457 --> 00:23:42,555
So, car wash!

388
00:23:42,913 --> 00:23:44,734
Car wash.

389
00:23:45,217 --> 00:23:47,297
We're having a car wash.

390
00:23:47,298 --> 00:23:48,988
Car wash.

391
00:23:49,058 --> 00:23:51,745
<i>No, I can't bend that way.</i>

392
00:23:51,746 --> 00:23:54,047
Hey, watch this, guys.

393
00:23:59,202 --> 00:24:00,386
Hi, guys.

394
00:24:00,387 --> 00:24:01,601
<i>Dude, that's wild.</i>

395
00:24:01,602 --> 00:24:03,842
<i>Oh, my God. Shelley, that's Colby.
I'm in love with him.</i>

396
00:24:03,843 --> 00:24:07,934
<i>Oh, that's so sweet.
How long have you guys been going out?</i>

397
00:24:08,195 --> 00:24:12,352
No. We are not going out.
I've never even talked to him.

398
00:24:12,708 --> 00:24:14,499
<i>And he's coming this way.
What do I do?</i>

399
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,189
Do sexy.

400
00:24:17,027 --> 00:24:20,739
Wash these cars, you sexy bitches!

401
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:23,839
They are filthy. And so are you!

402
00:24:24,133 --> 00:24:26,115
Did she just call us bitches?

403
00:24:26,116 --> 00:24:27,907
Did she just call us sexy?

404
00:24:27,908 --> 00:24:30,180
Wash! Wash! Wash!

405
00:24:30,181 --> 00:24:33,628
Wash! Wash! Wash! Wash!

406
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,756
- Hey, girls.
- Hi.

407
00:24:38,085 --> 00:24:41,157
<i>Okay, that's the first time
we've ever spoken, so... First time.</i>

408
00:24:41,158 --> 00:24:42,685
Hi!

409
00:24:42,822 --> 00:24:46,662
We're just washing cars and being sexy.

410
00:24:46,663 --> 00:24:47,684
Mostly sexy.

411
00:24:47,685 --> 00:24:51,035
So, does anybody want a wet T-shirt?

412
00:24:51,463 --> 00:24:55,358
- Yeah.
- R, you know, maybe some wet pants.

413
00:24:59,463 --> 00:25:02,535
Someone went accident in her sexy pants.

414
00:25:02,536 --> 00:25:06,055
So, anyway, we're having some drinks
over at Theta later.

415
00:25:06,056 --> 00:25:07,944
- Theta.
- Totally.

416
00:25:07,945 --> 00:25:09,991
You wanna come over?

417
00:25:09,992 --> 00:25:11,584
Yes.

418
00:25:11,592 --> 00:25:14,792
Well, we are a little thirsty.

419
00:25:14,793 --> 00:25:17,096
Maybe you guys are, too.

420
00:25:17,097 --> 00:25:20,135
<i>Why don't you have a drink right now?</i>

421
00:25:20,136 --> 00:25:22,624
I'll take a little sip.

422
00:25:26,697 --> 00:25:28,639
I am so sorry.

423
00:25:29,258 --> 00:25:32,745
<i>Thought I'd help you wash
the testosterone off your face, Colby.</i>

424
00:25:32,746 --> 00:25:34,281
Well, cool.

425
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:38,472
So, what time can we drop by for drinks?

426
00:25:39,339 --> 00:25:41,705
Now that you mention it,

427
00:25:41,899 --> 00:25:43,594
the guest list is looking pretty full.

428
00:25:43,595 --> 00:25:45,995
So, maybe next time, all right?

429
00:25:45,996 --> 00:25:47,563
Hey, Super-brace!

430
00:25:47,564 --> 00:25:50,315
Il can. Il can.

431
00:25:50,316 --> 00:25:54,024
<i>Not cool, man. Let's go.
Come on, come on, let's go.</i>

432
00:25:54,956 --> 00:25:57,387
Well, I think we're done here,
sexy bitches.

433
00:25:57,388 --> 00:25:59,436
Thanks a lot, Mona.

434
00:25:59,437 --> 00:26:02,028
The one chance I get to talk to Colby,
and you completely ruin it.

435
00:26:02,029 --> 00:26:03,691
Yeah, because the whole
peeing-in-your-pants thing...

436
00:26:03,692 --> 00:26:05,355
was really working out well for you.

437
00:26:05,356 --> 00:26:06,796
Thank you.

438
00:26:06,797 --> 00:26:10,725
<i>My car's still dirty,
so I'll be out here if you need me.</i>

439
00:26:13,165 --> 00:26:15,620
Do you want a car wash?

440
00:26:16,846 --> 00:26:18,157
Me?

441
00:26:18,158 --> 00:26:20,717
Oh, no. No. I have a bike.

442
00:26:20,718 --> 00:26:22,893
Besides, I gotta get back to work.

443
00:26:22,894 --> 00:26:25,642
Oh, yeah. I know all about work.

444
00:26:25,678 --> 00:26:28,045
<i>I'm at work right now, actually.</i>

445
00:26:28,046 --> 00:26:30,222
Oh, do you wash cars?

446
00:26:30,223 --> 00:26:33,223
<i>No. I'm the Zeta Sorority Housemother.</i>

447
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:35,982
You seem a little young
to be a housemother.

448
00:26:35,983 --> 00:26:37,640
Really?

449
00:26:38,032 --> 00:26:40,175
<i>You think I'm young?</i>

450
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:42,255
Oh, thank you.

451
00:26:42,256 --> 00:26:43,792
Thank you.

452
00:26:43,793 --> 00:26:47,817
<i>I'm sorry to invade your space,
but I needed that.</i>

453
00:26:49,009 --> 00:26:51,183
<i>So, what's your job?</i>

454
00:26:51,184 --> 00:26:53,606
Oh... Job.

455
00:26:53,906 --> 00:26:57,319
I manage a nursing home.

456
00:26:58,737 --> 00:27:02,184
<i>It's so great you give nurses
a place to live.</i>

457
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:05,874
<i>Actually, it's a nursing home
for senior citizens.</i>

458
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:09,071
<i>An old folks'... Id people.
Id people.</i>

459
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:10,993
I know lots of old men.

460
00:27:10,994 --> 00:27:15,304
<i>Hairy and not hairy.
But I don't mean to brag.</i>

461
00:27:15,443 --> 00:27:17,678
So, they live there?

462
00:27:18,226 --> 00:27:20,210
Like an orphanage for old people?

463
00:27:20,211 --> 00:27:24,368
<i>Well, yeah. I mean, that's one way
you could look at it. Yeah.</i>

464
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:27,315
Their parents are gone,
and they live in a big building...

465
00:27:27,316 --> 00:27:29,523
all by themselves,
wondering where everybody went...

466
00:27:29,524 --> 00:27:32,044
<i>and I think I'm gonna cry.</i>

467
00:27:32,852 --> 00:27:37,748
Listen, if you want, you know,
you could stop by the nursing home...

468
00:27:37,749 --> 00:27:40,628
because we always need
volunteers to help out...

469
00:27:40,629 --> 00:27:42,675
and visit with the old people...

470
00:27:42,676 --> 00:27:44,244
if you're interested.

471
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:47,507
<i>Yeah. I'd love to.</i>

472
00:27:48,981 --> 00:27:53,236
My name is Shelley.
And I like long walks and hate rude people.

473
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:56,597
<i>Oh, that's good to know. I'm Oliver.</i>

474
00:27:56,598 --> 00:27:58,870
- Oliver.
- Yes.

475
00:27:58,871 --> 00:28:03,540
I like taking long walks with rude people.
Only on short piers, though.

476
00:28:07,576 --> 00:28:09,175
<i>That's funny.</i>

477
00:28:09,176 --> 00:28:11,062
- You're funny.
- Thank you.

478
00:28:11,063 --> 00:28:12,917
- Bye.
- Bye.

479
00:28:15,992 --> 00:28:17,551
Guys.

480
00:28:18,104 --> 00:28:20,152
<i>Okay, this isn't my fault.
Don't like...</i>

481
00:28:20,153 --> 00:28:22,071
I know it was a disaster, but she's...

482
00:28:22,072 --> 00:28:25,271
You guys, I just had the best idea
for our phila-tropy.

483
00:28:25,272 --> 00:28:26,616
Philanthropy.

484
00:28:26,617 --> 00:28:29,688
<i>We are gonna volunteer
at Oliver's nursing home.</i>

485
00:28:29,689 --> 00:28:31,352
Who is Oliver?

486
00:28:31,353 --> 00:28:34,360
<i>He's this guy I just met.
He's really sweet.</i>

487
00:28:34,361 --> 00:28:36,150
<i>And he's kind of cute, too.</i>

488
00:28:36,793 --> 00:28:38,201
Well...

489
00:28:38,202 --> 00:28:42,872
<i>I don't know if you guys can
recognize this, but Shelley is meeting guys.</i>

490
00:28:42,873 --> 00:28:45,593
And if she knows how to meet guys,
then we will learn how to meet guys.

491
00:28:45,594 --> 00:28:49,903
Then more girls'll wanna hang out with us.
Hence, more pledges.

492
00:28:49,979 --> 00:28:51,578
Yeah. Hence!

493
00:28:51,579 --> 00:28:53,306
<i>Okay, here's what we need to do.</i>

494
00:28:53,307 --> 00:28:56,666
We need to get all dressed up,
and then we need to go to a club...

495
00:28:56,667 --> 00:29:00,123
and drink fruity drinks
and dirty-dance with each other.

496
00:29:00,124 --> 00:29:04,090
- Why?
- To bond, y'old grumpy.

497
00:29:04,091 --> 00:29:06,619
Yeah, y'old grumpy. To bond.

498
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:09,755
<i>The music's playing.
Ur bodies are swaying.</i>

499
00:29:09,756 --> 00:29:11,163
<i>You know what I'm saying?</i>

500
00:29:11,164 --> 00:29:15,353
You know? We could like play
some form of dodge ball, maybe.

501
00:29:17,372 --> 00:29:20,284
We could tie our shoes together,
our tennis shoes...

502
00:29:20,285 --> 00:29:22,876
and we could throw them
over telephone wires.

503
00:29:22,877 --> 00:29:23,965
Because I see that everywhere...

504
00:29:23,966 --> 00:29:26,492
and it seems like people would
have fun doing that.

505
00:29:26,493 --> 00:29:28,509
<i>Like, "How hard can you throw?"</i>

506
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:32,088
You know what I mean? Like how...
What are you...

507
00:29:34,719 --> 00:29:37,237
r we could go to a club.

508
00:29:50,367 --> 00:29:53,663
Six Virgin Marys and one Kamikaze.

509
00:29:53,664 --> 00:29:57,721
<i>Here's to Zetas, to making you guys
the best sorority ever.</i>

510
00:29:59,904 --> 00:30:02,751
Oh, Mona, that guy is totally
checking you out.

511
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:05,600
- Go flirt with him.
- Right.

512
00:30:05,601 --> 00:30:08,224
Think of it as research,
Mona. Research.

513
00:30:08,225 --> 00:30:10,208
Get over there. Get on that horse!

514
00:30:10,209 --> 00:30:12,729
Go, go. Go!

515
00:30:16,418 --> 00:30:17,761
You like what you see, stud?

516
00:30:17,762 --> 00:30:20,480
<i>I'm not really sure
what I'm looking at, metalface.</i>

517
00:30:20,481 --> 00:30:22,946
Let me guess,
is it a Hannibal Lecter thing?

518
00:30:22,947 --> 00:30:24,801
Yeah, it is.

519
00:30:30,338 --> 00:30:32,898
<i>There's a big box of cutesicles.</i>

520
00:30:32,899 --> 00:30:34,594
Carrie Mae, go work your magic.

521
00:30:34,595 --> 00:30:36,706
The only magic I've ever done
was try to figure out a way

522
00:30:36,707 --> 00:30:40,739
to stay in college for nine years
and not go back to my trailer park in Idaho.

523
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:43,587
So, figure out a way into his heart.

524
00:30:43,588 --> 00:30:47,745
Just go over there
and talk to him about any old thing.

525
00:30:51,364 --> 00:30:53,796
Excuse me,
you know where the crapper is?

526
00:30:53,797 --> 00:30:56,764
I have to drop off some timber.

527
00:30:58,054 --> 00:30:59,940
Go away.

528
00:31:00,742 --> 00:31:02,596
<i>What'd I do?</i>

529
00:31:02,597 --> 00:31:04,996
<i>It's okay. It's just,
Carrie Mae, sometimes...</i>

530
00:31:04,997 --> 00:31:08,774
men like their women
with a little bit of mystery.

531
00:31:08,775 --> 00:31:12,068
So, get back over there and try it again.

532
00:31:16,295 --> 00:31:18,149
Excuse me.

533
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:19,847
You know where the crapper is?

534
00:31:19,848 --> 00:31:23,229
I have to do a very mysterious thing
in there.

535
00:31:23,271 --> 00:31:25,638
Drop off some timber.

536
00:31:26,504 --> 00:31:29,701
<i>I'm definitely not drunk enough
for that.</i>

537
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:36,103
Well, this is good, though.

538
00:31:36,104 --> 00:31:38,689
This is really good practice.

539
00:31:38,793 --> 00:31:40,264
<i>Hey, it's the Zetas.</i>

540
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:41,544
- Hi.
- Hi.

541
00:31:41,545 --> 00:31:43,208
I feel like we never see you guys out.

542
00:31:43,209 --> 00:31:45,672
We never see them out, either.

543
00:31:45,673 --> 00:31:48,360
I met you yesterday.
I was that homeless girl.

544
00:31:48,361 --> 00:31:49,798
<i>Now I'm their house mom.</i>

545
00:31:49,833 --> 00:31:52,457
<i>Congratulations. That's awesome.</i>

546
00:31:52,458 --> 00:31:55,176
So, hey, you guys got here just in time.

547
00:31:55,177 --> 00:31:59,306
We're doing a little karaoke contest.
Sororities versus fraternities.

548
00:31:59,307 --> 00:32:01,770
Yeah, you guys can go next if you want.

549
00:32:01,771 --> 00:32:03,274
Yeah! Come on!

550
00:32:03,275 --> 00:32:07,366
Oh, girls! Always say "yes" to karaoke.

551
00:32:07,531 --> 00:32:09,354
Yeah, we'll pick a great song for you.

552
00:32:09,355 --> 00:32:11,498
<i>Don't worry,
you can't be any worse than we were.</i>

553
00:32:11,499 --> 00:32:13,643
- Seriously, we were wretched.
- Awful.

554
00:32:13,644 --> 00:32:15,532
<i>- I don't know.
- Oh, okay. Okay, listen.</i>

555
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:19,371
Just give me a second.
I promise the Zetas are going up on stage.

556
00:32:19,372 --> 00:32:21,346
Awesome. Great.

557
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:24,105
You guys, karaoke is so fun!

558
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:27,467
<i>You gotta get up there and do karaoke.
Boys like singing. It's sexy.</i>

559
00:32:27,468 --> 00:32:31,526
Go! Go! Get up there! Go! Go!

560
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,740
I think we can do it.

561
00:32:33,741 --> 00:32:35,981
We can do anything better
than those mannequins, you guys.

562
00:32:35,982 --> 00:32:37,932
<i>I might puke, but let's do it!</i>

563
00:32:37,933 --> 00:32:40,104
<i>That's the spirit!</i>

564
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:44,648
All right! Get up there, you Bravehearts!

565
00:32:47,982 --> 00:32:50,949
<i>All right, that was Kappa Eta Sigma!</i>

566
00:32:54,991 --> 00:32:58,090
<i>Next up, the Zetas?</i>

567
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:01,644
<i>Singing Like A Virgin.</i>

568
00:33:08,656 --> 00:33:12,005
¶I made it through the wilderness... ¶

569
00:33:12,144 --> 00:33:15,755
¶Somehow I made it through... ¶

570
00:33:17,169 --> 00:33:22,570
¶Didn't know how lost I was
Until I found you... ¶

571
00:33:23,729 --> 00:33:27,377
¶I was beat, incomplete... ¶

572
00:33:27,378 --> 00:33:31,792
¶I'm a hag and I'm fat and rude... ¶

573
00:33:31,793 --> 00:33:34,924
¶But you made me feel... ¶

574
00:33:35,282 --> 00:33:39,154
¶Yeah, you made me feel... ¶

575
00:33:39,189 --> 00:33:43,026
¶Like a big bag of poop¶

576
00:33:43,027 --> 00:33:45,394
¶Like a loser¶

577
00:33:46,228 --> 00:33:50,123
¶We're rejected all the time¶

578
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:54,419
¶Like a loser¶

579
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:58,260
¶Who's so retarded, it's a crime¶

580
00:33:58,261 --> 00:34:00,464
¶Like a... ¶

581
00:34:09,557 --> 00:34:11,826
That was not nice.

582
00:34:12,246 --> 00:34:13,525
Awesome.

583
00:34:13,526 --> 00:34:15,508
You wanna get cut, bitch?

584
00:34:15,509 --> 00:34:18,389
Oh, classy. Very classy.

585
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:22,390
<i>No, no, no, no, she's right, Courtney.
I mean, we should apologize.</i>

586
00:34:22,391 --> 00:34:24,277
Especially since we're
about to take their house.

587
00:34:24,278 --> 00:34:26,806
- Oh, right.
- Where are you taking it?

588
00:34:26,807 --> 00:34:29,430
Well, we heard that you were
losing your charter,

589
00:34:29,431 --> 00:34:33,590
so Phi lota Mu is gonna buy your crappy
house when it goes on sale after rush.

590
00:34:33,591 --> 00:34:37,879
Yes, we are going to have so many pledges,
we'll need all of the extra space.

591
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,287
<i>Oh, but don't worry.</i>

592
00:34:39,288 --> 00:34:42,359
I mean, we'll still let you guys
stay on and be the maids.

593
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:46,007
<i>You can sweep the chimney.
Won't that be nice?</i>

594
00:34:46,008 --> 00:34:47,863
Does the little one understand human talk?

595
00:34:47,864 --> 00:34:50,680
Oh, and I guess
that when we buy your house,

596
00:34:50,715 --> 00:34:52,568
you'll go back to being homeless.

597
00:34:52,569 --> 00:34:53,784
<i>I'm a housemother.</i>

598
00:34:53,785 --> 00:34:57,208
<i>A Zeta housemother, and I don't like
some of the things you were saying.</i>

599
00:34:57,209 --> 00:35:00,569
Because they do understand human talk,
and you hurt their feelings.

600
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:02,553
<i>Oh, Shelley, come on.
It's not worth it, let's go.</i>

601
00:35:02,554 --> 00:35:04,025
Yeah, you should go.

602
00:35:04,026 --> 00:35:05,370
It was so nice to see you.

603
00:35:05,371 --> 00:35:06,393
But I really think that...

604
00:35:06,394 --> 00:35:07,986
- So nice.
- So nice.

605
00:35:09,114 --> 00:35:11,641
That was so humiliating, you guys.

606
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:12,857
I know it was awful.

607
00:35:12,858 --> 00:35:15,418
And I am so mad
that they did that to you guys,

608
00:35:15,419 --> 00:35:18,746
<i>but we can't listen to those girls.</i>

609
00:35:18,747 --> 00:35:21,594
Why? They're right. We are losers.

610
00:35:21,595 --> 00:35:23,984
Oh, we're not losers.

611
00:35:24,092 --> 00:35:26,841
You just ignore that dumb old wall.

612
00:35:27,453 --> 00:35:31,419
Well, you're not a loser, Shelley.
People like you. You're pretty.

613
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:34,769
<i>I just don't understand
that kind of behavior.</i>

614
00:35:34,973 --> 00:35:36,380
Trust me.

615
00:35:36,381 --> 00:35:41,116
You guys, I can make you way hotter
than any old Phi lota Mu.

616
00:35:41,469 --> 00:35:45,725
<i>By the time I'm done, every girl
on campus'll want to pledge Zeta.</i>

617
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:48,988
No, really, we are just a bunch of misfits.

618
00:35:49,949 --> 00:35:53,821
Lilly just texted me from the closet.
She says we're not misfits.

619
00:35:53,822 --> 00:35:55,829
Well, I hope she was being ironic.

620
00:35:56,734 --> 00:35:58,206
Go, go, go, go, go!

621
00:35:58,207 --> 00:35:59,389
- Are we doing this?
- Do it!

622
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:01,021
- All right.
- Here.

623
00:36:01,022 --> 00:36:02,877
You can do this.

624
00:36:02,878 --> 00:36:06,782
If I thought you all were quitting...
My heart would just fall out of my head.

625
00:36:06,783 --> 00:36:09,087
Shelley, your heart is not in your head.

626
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:12,606
Your heart has its own cavity.
Right under your fake boobs.

627
00:36:12,607 --> 00:36:14,239
Do you understand how moronic you sound...

628
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,183
when you say your heart is gonna fall
out of your head?

629
00:36:17,184 --> 00:36:19,093
Well, Mona...

630
00:36:19,168 --> 00:36:23,136
I totally understand
why that saying sounds mixed-up...

631
00:36:23,137 --> 00:36:25,375
<i>but I don't mean it for real.</i>

632
00:36:25,376 --> 00:36:28,672
<i>I don't think that my heart
is in my skull.</i>

633
00:36:28,673 --> 00:36:33,536
What I mean is that sometimes
logic tells you to do something...

634
00:36:33,537 --> 00:36:37,313
but you have to have part
of your heart in it as well.

635
00:36:37,314 --> 00:36:42,681
My head and my heart tell me
that we can save Zeta.

636
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:48,480
We need 30 pledges,
and I know just how to do it.

637
00:36:48,866 --> 00:36:52,663
By making you guys
the hottest girls on campus.

638
00:36:57,731 --> 00:36:59,585
I'll get it.

639
00:37:04,067 --> 00:37:06,619
- Does that say "Zeta"?
- Yeah.

640
00:37:08,004 --> 00:37:10,372
This is war.

641
00:37:10,373 --> 00:37:11,972
Enough is enough.

642
00:37:11,973 --> 00:37:15,518
<i>Let's do this. There's no way
those bitches are getting our house.</i>

643
00:37:28,229 --> 00:37:31,654
Okay, ladies,
dressing sexy is all about skimplifying.

644
00:37:31,655 --> 00:37:34,886
I want you to show skin
in the four major regions.

645
00:37:34,887 --> 00:37:37,989
Arms, legs, belly and cleavage.

646
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:39,366
Is this how you skimplify?

647
00:37:39,367 --> 00:37:42,982
<i>Oh, okay. Well, maybe we could let
someone who doesn't have a giant baby...</i>

648
00:37:42,983 --> 00:37:44,710
in their belly give it a try.

649
00:37:44,711 --> 00:37:49,158
Okay, this is your most important
secret weapon, the water bra.

650
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:51,207
Just stay away from sharp corners.

651
00:37:51,208 --> 00:37:53,543
This is going too far.

652
00:37:53,544 --> 00:37:55,780
No. No way. No.

653
00:37:56,201 --> 00:37:59,303
Just consider it like
another thesis topic, you know?

654
00:37:59,304 --> 00:38:03,079
<i>"Conventional Archetypes of Beauty
and Their Effect on the pposite Sex".</i>

655
00:38:09,257 --> 00:38:10,504
<i>Are you sure that's everything?</i>

656
00:38:10,505 --> 00:38:15,492
Because feeling good on the inside
is all about looking good on the outside.

657
00:38:20,138 --> 00:38:22,345
Go ahead and keep that one.

658
00:38:22,346 --> 00:38:25,386
There are three rules
to successful flirtation.

659
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:28,714
Eye contact,
flattery and lots of touching.

660
00:38:28,715 --> 00:38:31,882
<i>For example, let's pretend
that Natalie here is a man.</i>

661
00:38:31,883 --> 00:38:35,659
<i>I'm touching his arm,
I'm looking deep into his eyes...</i>

662
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:38,155
<i>and I'm wearing deodorant.
Carrie Mae?</i>

663
00:38:38,156 --> 00:38:39,435
I know.

664
00:38:39,436 --> 00:38:41,898
And I might say something like this.

665
00:38:41,899 --> 00:38:46,274
<i>"h, my gosh.
Your biceps are huge. Kiss me".</i>

666
00:38:46,348 --> 00:38:49,932
And then he would kiss me.
So, any questions?

667
00:38:49,933 --> 00:38:52,267
What do I do with my chew?

668
00:38:52,268 --> 00:38:53,644
How long would the kiss usually be?

669
00:38:53,645 --> 00:38:57,224
And, also, why would he kiss you,
because you...

670
00:39:00,366 --> 00:39:03,821
<i>kay, ladies,
today's lesson is makeup.</i>

671
00:39:03,822 --> 00:39:06,477
First, we must highlight your eyes.

672
00:39:06,478 --> 00:39:09,708
The eyes are the nipples of the face.

673
00:39:54,547 --> 00:39:56,400
Whoa.

674
00:40:04,243 --> 00:40:05,769
Wow.

675
00:40:05,907 --> 00:40:08,338
So this is what it feels like
to not be invisible.

676
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:12,300
<i>We weren't exactly invisible before,
just the anti-hot.</i>

677
00:40:13,203 --> 00:40:14,516
Check out Joanne.

678
00:40:14,517 --> 00:40:16,306
I really like what you've done
with the Bedazzler.

679
00:40:16,307 --> 00:40:18,227
<i>- Thank you.
- It's nice.</i>

680
00:40:18,228 --> 00:40:19,347
<i>So what's next, Shelley?</i>

681
00:40:19,348 --> 00:40:22,644
I want all the fraternities to see
how hot you guys are.

682
00:40:22,645 --> 00:40:26,356
Kind of like a coming-out party.
So we are gonna take some pictures.

683
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:28,660
<i>Oh, we are not posing for Playboy.</i>

684
00:40:28,661 --> 00:40:32,276
<i>No, in a calendar".
The Girls of Zeta".</i>

685
00:40:32,277 --> 00:40:33,972
Everyone will see the new you,

686
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:37,588
and selling the calendars will help us
raise money for our phil-an-coppopopy.

687
00:40:37,589 --> 00:40:39,700
Hey, you guys, Lilly just texted me.

688
00:40:39,701 --> 00:40:42,767
She says we look hot and this is fun.

689
00:40:47,799 --> 00:40:51,759
Keep doing that, keep doing that.
Make love to the camera.

690
00:40:51,959 --> 00:40:54,486
<i>I saw that in Austin Powers.</i>

691
00:40:54,487 --> 00:40:59,190
Yeah, work it. Think really sexy witch.

692
00:40:59,191 --> 00:41:02,647
- Are you a good witch or a bad witch?
- A good witch.

693
00:41:02,648 --> 00:41:04,663
I think you're a bad witch.

694
00:41:04,664 --> 00:41:09,486
I bet the house that falls on you
is gonna be a sexy house.

695
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,960
Work it. Work it.

696
00:41:11,961 --> 00:41:16,053
You're like a supermodel,
except more pregnant. Keep going.

697
00:41:33,466 --> 00:41:37,945
Okay, Henry, very glad you finally learned
how to use the suggestion box.

698
00:41:37,946 --> 00:41:40,282
And I want to let you know
that I got your message...

699
00:41:40,283 --> 00:41:42,362
you want less Boggle and more bingo.

700
00:41:42,363 --> 00:41:44,442
<i>So I'm gonna work on it, okay?</i>

701
00:41:44,443 --> 00:41:47,738
<i>Whoa.
Okay, what's going on with your heart?</i>

702
00:41:47,899 --> 00:41:50,102
Shelley, you're here.

703
00:41:51,485 --> 00:41:53,306
- Move out of the way, man.
- Move it, Junior.

704
00:41:53,307 --> 00:41:55,129
- Sideways.
- Sorry, sorry.

705
00:41:55,132 --> 00:41:56,888
- Hi.
- Hi.

706
00:41:58,172 --> 00:42:01,628
We brought a donation
as part of our philtrophy.

707
00:42:01,629 --> 00:42:04,345
Oh, great. Thank you.

708
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:05,980
We're making calendars...

709
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:08,060
and before we could even
get them all out...

710
00:42:08,061 --> 00:42:10,653
the printing-press guys bought up
the first batch.

711
00:42:10,654 --> 00:42:12,669
Wow. Great, thank you very much.

712
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:16,532
<i>This is,
"Pay to the order of old People".</i>

713
00:42:17,342 --> 00:42:19,261
<i>Yes, and it doesn't stop there.</i>

714
00:42:19,262 --> 00:42:24,379
I hope you don't mind, but I brought a few
extra volunteers to help out today.

715
00:42:25,662 --> 00:42:28,190
Henry, Henry, look away. Look away, okay?

716
00:42:28,191 --> 00:42:32,734
Look at the wall.
Think of broccoli and bad bingo cards.

717
00:42:32,735 --> 00:42:34,878
You know, actually, your timing is perfect,

718
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:38,494
because I was about to try
and organize a dance class.

719
00:42:38,495 --> 00:42:40,031
Nobody signed up.

720
00:42:40,032 --> 00:42:43,008
And I was at the top of the list
not signing up.

721
00:42:43,009 --> 00:42:46,495
<i>There ain't no way I'm dancing.
You can forget that.</i>

722
00:42:46,496 --> 00:42:48,768
Oh, I love to dance.

723
00:42:48,769 --> 00:42:50,459
<i>Well, let's do it.</i>

724
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:56,447
Okay, ladies, fan out and find a partner.

725
00:42:58,305 --> 00:43:02,266
And maybe we should talk
about this music.

726
00:43:03,362 --> 00:43:06,306
Wow, this music is super, super-great,

727
00:43:06,307 --> 00:43:10,943
but we might want to try
something a little sexier.

728
00:43:25,123 --> 00:43:27,262
Great job, ladies.

729
00:43:40,165 --> 00:43:43,332
Shelley, I just wanna thank you so much
for doing this.

730
00:43:43,333 --> 00:43:44,452
<i>It's just so kind.</i>

731
00:43:44,453 --> 00:43:49,276
Oh, well, kindness is just love
with its work boots on.

732
00:43:49,733 --> 00:43:52,634
Hey, Oliver, ask the girl to dance.

733
00:43:53,542 --> 00:43:55,877
<i>- I'd love to.
- Really?</i>

734
00:43:57,862 --> 00:44:00,000
Looking good, Jean.

735
00:44:00,966 --> 00:44:05,382
<i>So, listen, Shelley, I was wondering
if maybe you'd like to have dinner sometime.</i>

736
00:44:05,383 --> 00:44:08,134
Really? Yes. Yeah.

737
00:44:08,135 --> 00:44:09,793
Great.

738
00:44:10,472 --> 00:44:13,286
<i>- Bitchsuck!
- Sorry. I'm sorry.</i>

739
00:44:13,287 --> 00:44:15,425
<i>Oh, it's all good.</i>

740
00:44:17,704 --> 00:44:19,429
<i>I'm so glad to be back.</i>

741
00:44:19,464 --> 00:44:23,335
Marvin, tell Shelley we're back
and we're gonna be watching a movie.

742
00:44:23,336 --> 00:44:24,967
How about something spooky? No, funny.

743
00:44:24,968 --> 00:44:27,144
<i>No. How about Scarface?</i>

744
00:44:27,145 --> 00:44:29,352
<i>No, you guys, I think it should be
Shelley's pick tonight.</i>

745
00:44:29,353 --> 00:44:34,339
<i>Mr. Hefner, Shelley's actually gone.
She told me to give you this letter.</i>

746
00:44:42,571 --> 00:44:45,865
Shelley moved to Africa
to work with the orphans.

747
00:44:45,866 --> 00:44:47,081
She left while we were gone...

748
00:44:47,082 --> 00:44:50,464
<i>because she says
she can't deal with goodbyes.</i>

749
00:44:51,883 --> 00:44:54,947
<i>I'm going to bed.
No movies tonight.</i>

750
00:44:57,259 --> 00:44:59,051
You look nervous.

751
00:44:59,052 --> 00:45:02,379
<i>I don't like when you look nervous.
You will not blow this!</i>

752
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:03,596
But I just wanna mix drinks.

753
00:45:03,597 --> 00:45:05,803
<i>You know, my whole life,
that's all I've ever wanted to do...</i>

754
00:45:05,804 --> 00:45:07,499
is just blend.

755
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:10,220
And then you come along with your weird
kryptonite death grip, and...

756
00:45:10,221 --> 00:45:12,588
<i>- That's right, it's like this.
- Oh, good God!</i>

757
00:45:12,589 --> 00:45:14,157
<i>Oh, sweet bastard, that's good.</i>

758
00:45:14,158 --> 00:45:17,420
<i>That's right, and I'm the only woman
that can make you feel like that.</i>

759
00:45:17,421 --> 00:45:20,877
You will not tell Hef
that we wrote that letter to Shelley.

760
00:45:20,878 --> 00:45:22,125
- Just do it again.
- Got it?

761
00:45:22,126 --> 00:45:25,355
- Yeah, I got it, I got it. So I got it.
- Good.

762
00:45:34,863 --> 00:45:36,397
Hi. I'll take two calendars.

763
00:45:36,398 --> 00:45:39,950
<i>Wow. That's so generous.
Everyone's been buying two.</i>

764
00:45:39,951 --> 00:45:43,114
<i>Actually, it's in case one gets ruined.</i>

765
00:45:43,631 --> 00:45:45,775
Hot dogs, Zeta hot dogs. Who wants one?

766
00:45:45,776 --> 00:45:48,644
You. You. You got one.

767
00:45:52,496 --> 00:45:54,798
Sweet setup here.

768
00:45:55,345 --> 00:45:58,287
We should totally have a mixer
with you guys sometime.

769
00:45:58,288 --> 00:45:59,913
Yeah.

770
00:46:03,889 --> 00:46:05,552
<i>We could have one with Battle...</i>

771
00:46:05,553 --> 00:46:07,054
What? Ne more time.

772
00:46:07,089 --> 00:46:10,512
<i>We could have a Battlestar Galactica night.
With pudding!</i>

773
00:46:10,513 --> 00:46:12,528
Definitely! What?

774
00:46:12,529 --> 00:46:14,385
<i>Battlestar Galactica. kay.</i>

775
00:46:14,386 --> 00:46:18,795
She said that you guys should get together
some night, with pudding.

776
00:46:18,962 --> 00:46:20,554
Whoa.

777
00:46:20,658 --> 00:46:22,831
You betcha. You betcha.

778
00:46:22,866 --> 00:46:26,962
At Phi lota Mu we are very exclusive,
because we can be.

779
00:46:26,963 --> 00:46:30,098
Many of our sisters are leaders on campus.

780
00:46:30,099 --> 00:46:35,598
We have a rocking GPA
and our very own Korean manicurist.

781
00:46:40,979 --> 00:46:43,123
Hey, where are you guys going?

782
00:46:43,124 --> 00:46:46,451
<i>- Whose booth is that?
- That's Zeta's booth.</i>

783
00:46:46,548 --> 00:46:49,300
<i>Don't be ridiculous.
Why would they have a booth?</i>

784
00:46:49,301 --> 00:46:50,421
And who would go to it?

785
00:46:50,422 --> 00:46:52,468
<i>- Do you want some ketchup?
- That'd be great.</i>

786
00:46:52,469 --> 00:46:54,740
I can totally hose you some right there.
Go ahead, lean back.

787
00:46:54,741 --> 00:46:56,977
<i>No, I'm just...</i>

788
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:02,833
- Excuse me.
- Why, did you fart?

789
00:47:03,221 --> 00:47:05,741
- Did I do what?
- Fart.

790
00:47:07,351 --> 00:47:08,789
Where are the Zetas?

791
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:11,094
We are the Zetas, 2008 edition.

792
00:47:11,129 --> 00:47:13,264
<i>And I'm in love!</i>

793
00:47:24,984 --> 00:47:26,679
<i>Why'd you do that?</i>

794
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:29,167
I needed to hurt someone.

795
00:47:31,864 --> 00:47:35,031
This is so awesome, you guys.
That was so much fun!

796
00:47:35,032 --> 00:47:36,631
It was, it was.

797
00:47:36,632 --> 00:47:39,982
Harmony, Brian Stone was all over you, girl.

798
00:47:40,409 --> 00:47:41,657
- And how about Mona?
- What?

799
00:47:41,658 --> 00:47:44,472
I got numbers from four boys.
It was all for research.

800
00:47:44,473 --> 00:47:45,560
Liar.

801
00:47:45,561 --> 00:47:47,800
- Careful what you research.
- But I really had fun.

802
00:47:47,801 --> 00:47:53,170
Well, Natalie, Colby was
following you around like a puppy dog.

803
00:47:53,562 --> 00:47:56,627
Do you guys think you'll, you know...

804
00:47:57,434 --> 00:47:58,961
No.

805
00:47:59,547 --> 00:48:03,706
I do not think, you know, that.

806
00:48:03,707 --> 00:48:05,365
<i>"That"?</i>

807
00:48:06,426 --> 00:48:09,721
Natalie, are you a virgin?

808
00:48:10,396 --> 00:48:12,184
No.

809
00:48:12,508 --> 00:48:15,060
Am I a virgin? No.

810
00:48:15,388 --> 00:48:16,571
You're a virgin!

811
00:48:16,572 --> 00:48:19,739
<i>Shelley! It's like an
amphitheater in here!</i>

812
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:21,307
<i>That's it.</i>

813
00:48:21,308 --> 00:48:23,516
Oh, my gosh.
We have to have an Aztec party.

814
00:48:23,517 --> 00:48:24,892
We always wanted
to have one at the Mansion...

815
00:48:24,893 --> 00:48:27,963
but we could never find
a virgin to sacrifice.

816
00:48:27,964 --> 00:48:30,842
Natalie, it is gonna be
the best time ever.

817
00:48:30,877 --> 00:48:35,962
We are gonna have the most rockingest
party, and then we'll get our 30 pledges.

818
00:48:49,215 --> 00:48:51,197
Okay, quick trick, watch this.

819
00:48:51,198 --> 00:48:54,238
We are gonna put little trails
of Vaseline on the contours of our abs...

820
00:48:54,239 --> 00:48:58,396
mist it a little, and that way
the light will catch our tans.

821
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,039
Oh, she says
you're completely ingenious, Shelley.

822
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,767
Thank you, Lilly.

823
00:49:04,768 --> 00:49:06,271
<i>That's the same as vapid, right?</i>

824
00:49:06,272 --> 00:49:08,544
<i>Oh, it's better than vapid.</i>

825
00:49:08,545 --> 00:49:11,648
- Is that Juicy?
- Yeah, I love their stuff.

826
00:49:11,649 --> 00:49:14,943
<i>It's a shame nobody'd be able to see it,
you know, under my brace.</i>

827
00:49:14,944 --> 00:49:17,120
Well, when can you take the brace off?

828
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:20,121
2004, actually.

829
00:49:20,865 --> 00:49:22,752
<i>Well, it's a good thing I asked.</i>

830
00:49:22,753 --> 00:49:28,001
<i>No, I'm so fine, I mean, you know,
it's all indented into me</i>

831
00:49:28,002 --> 00:49:30,946
and, you know, if I took it off, I wouldn't
even know what would possibly happen...

832
00:49:30,947 --> 00:49:33,505
and my spine could be like a noodle. And...

833
00:49:33,506 --> 00:49:36,320
<i>I'm really good. I'm good. Thanks.</i>

834
00:49:37,795 --> 00:49:39,681
Come with me.

835
00:49:39,875 --> 00:49:42,529
Joanne, when I was little,
I wore a Scooby-Doo mask to school...

836
00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:44,899
for a whole month
because I thought I was ugly.

837
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:46,146
- Thanks, guys.
- You're welcome.

838
00:49:46,147 --> 00:49:48,355
And then one day
a boy, Howard Rubenstock...

839
00:49:48,356 --> 00:49:50,819
snuck up behind me
and tore it off my face.

840
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:53,763
- Do you know what I realized?
- That you were pretty?

841
00:49:53,764 --> 00:49:56,797
No, that I was wearing it upside down.

842
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:59,172
<i>I'm not really sure
what you're trying to tell me, Shelley.</i>

843
00:49:59,173 --> 00:50:03,459
<i>I'm not either. But the point is,
you're a butterfly now, not an earthworm.</i>

844
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:05,475
<i>You don't need to hide anymore.</i>

845
00:50:05,476 --> 00:50:07,972
So, okay, here he comes.

846
00:50:07,973 --> 00:50:10,357
He runs past here every day,
and I've seen you staring at him.

847
00:50:10,392 --> 00:50:12,741
I can tell that you like him
and that you want to talk to him.

848
00:50:12,742 --> 00:50:15,301
<i>Today's the day.
Go invite him to our party.</i>

849
00:50:15,302 --> 00:50:17,156
Go. Go.

850
00:50:21,542 --> 00:50:23,746
Run, Joanne, run!

851
00:50:49,544 --> 00:50:50,695
Hi, Steve.

852
00:50:50,696 --> 00:50:53,704
<i>Oh, hey, Joanne. How are you?
I didn't know you ran.</i>

853
00:50:53,705 --> 00:50:55,849
Sure, I mean, I do now.

854
00:50:55,850 --> 00:50:57,224
<i>Where's your brace?</i>

855
00:50:57,225 --> 00:50:59,493
<i>- It's gone.
- Really?</i>

856
00:51:04,939 --> 00:51:06,506
Well.

857
00:51:06,507 --> 00:51:08,649
<i>You're pretty pleased with yourself,
aren't you?</i>

858
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:12,578
<i>Oh, you scared me.
My heart's pounding like a nail.</i>

859
00:51:13,675 --> 00:51:16,042
I guess I am a little proud.

860
00:51:16,043 --> 00:51:18,378
<i>Well,
don't get too used to that feeling.</i>

861
00:51:18,379 --> 00:51:21,418
<i>Because there's no way that I'm going
to let a whorey little tart like you...</i>

862
00:51:21,419 --> 00:51:24,484
stand in the way of the Phi lota Mu.

863
00:51:24,652 --> 00:51:26,668
<i>Don't mess with me.</i>

864
00:51:26,669 --> 00:51:29,319
<i>Don't mess with Phi lota Mu.</i>

865
00:51:33,548 --> 00:51:38,285
Man! Someone needs a mani-pedi
massage combo, pronto.

866
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:39,404
- Shelley!
- Oh, my...

867
00:51:39,405 --> 00:51:41,740
<i>Steve said he's gonna come
to the Aztec party.</i>

868
00:51:41,741 --> 00:51:43,276
<i>Steve, he's gonna come.</i>

869
00:51:43,277 --> 00:51:46,278
Yay! This is gonna be so much fun!

870
00:52:02,222 --> 00:52:05,614
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- God! Oh, my God!

871
00:52:05,615 --> 00:52:08,200
- Yes!
- Hey, you guys! Look.

872
00:52:08,304 --> 00:52:10,093
Oh, Joanne.

873
00:52:10,416 --> 00:52:13,743
I can bend! You guys, I did it,
I can bend!

874
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:19,439
<i>"Do you find yourself more attracted
to me when I'm like this...</i>

875
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,513
<i>"or like this?"</i>

876
00:52:22,064 --> 00:52:24,366
- The second one.
- Great.

877
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,640
So, "Because you like my boobs...

878
00:52:26,641 --> 00:52:30,220
<i>"would you stand there
and let me go like this...</i>

879
00:52:30,609 --> 00:52:33,712
<i>"for five minutes,
just in the hope that we might hook up?"</i>

880
00:52:33,713 --> 00:52:36,430
Yes. Yes, I would.

881
00:52:39,154 --> 00:52:42,601
Guys! Anybody want some chips?

882
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:44,561
Yeah, have chips while you party.

883
00:52:44,562 --> 00:52:47,410
Badass party. Badass.

884
00:52:47,411 --> 00:52:51,730
So, Miss December,
you got your bikini on under there? Huh?

885
00:52:51,731 --> 00:52:54,482
No, actually, just my fake water...

886
00:52:54,483 --> 00:52:56,114
Natalie, there you are.

887
00:52:56,115 --> 00:52:59,987
Oh, Bobby and Zach from Kappa are just
dying to meet you.

888
00:52:59,988 --> 00:53:03,784
<i>I'm sorry, Colby,
but Natalie is a very hot commodity.</i>

889
00:53:04,692 --> 00:53:06,732
- Excuse us.
- Wait.

890
00:53:06,836 --> 00:53:08,147
Wait a second.

891
00:53:08,148 --> 00:53:09,907
- Are we leaving?
- Yes.

892
00:53:09,908 --> 00:53:11,027
Why?

893
00:53:11,028 --> 00:53:13,460
<i>I have, like,
the world's hugest crush on him.</i>

894
00:53:13,461 --> 00:53:14,484
<i>So I don't really...</i>

895
00:53:14,485 --> 00:53:17,204
I know. Then we need to let him see
how in demand you are.

896
00:53:17,205 --> 00:53:20,020
Always remember,
boys want what other boys want.

897
00:53:20,021 --> 00:53:21,745
Right.

898
00:53:23,670 --> 00:53:25,644
Are you Lilly?

899
00:53:26,614 --> 00:53:28,917
<i>That's a cute costume, Lil.</i>

900
00:53:28,918 --> 00:53:31,222
I was gonna ask you this,
because I've been seeing these all over.

901
00:53:31,223 --> 00:53:33,046
I mean, this is an Aztec party...

902
00:53:33,047 --> 00:53:36,118
you know, so those statues don't really fit,
because those are from Easter Island...

903
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:38,998
which is like 2000 miles away,
as you probably know, in Polynesia.

904
00:53:38,999 --> 00:53:43,158
<i>Wait, Natalie. You're too smart.
Boys don't like girls that are too smart.</i>

905
00:53:43,159 --> 00:53:44,374
Right.

906
00:53:44,375 --> 00:53:48,018
<i>Right.
God, I hope Colby didn't hear me say that.</i>

907
00:53:48,408 --> 00:53:50,999
Shelley, you really know all the tricks.

908
00:53:51,034 --> 00:53:52,599
How do you do it, you know?

909
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:55,160
I mean, with Colby here
and with Oliver asking you out...

910
00:53:55,161 --> 00:53:58,901
<i>it's like we might both
lose our virginity this year.</i>

911
00:53:59,608 --> 00:54:01,332
Yeah.

912
00:54:05,497 --> 00:54:09,359
<i>It's supposed to be a mixer.
There's no one here to mix.</i>

913
00:54:09,593 --> 00:54:12,537
<i>They're over there, aren't they?
The Kappas.</i>

914
00:54:12,538 --> 00:54:15,129
Well, they're definitely not here.

915
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:18,196
I know that, dipswitch. I can see that.

916
00:54:20,986 --> 00:54:24,336
<i>And now,
let the sacrificial rites begin!</i>

917
00:54:27,068 --> 00:54:32,151
<i>It's time for this virgin to get
sacrificed in the boiling Jell-O lava!</i>

918
00:54:32,443 --> 00:54:35,131
- Sacrifice! Sacrifice!
- Sacrifice! Sacrifice!

919
00:54:35,132 --> 00:54:37,211
- Sacrifice! Sacrifice!
- Sacrifice! Sacrifice!

920
00:54:37,212 --> 00:54:42,011
<i>This is Aztec Night, the first of many
awesome Zeta parties to come.</i>

921
00:54:42,012 --> 00:54:43,963
<i>And for those of you girls
going through rush...</i>

922
00:54:43,964 --> 00:54:47,444
<i>remember to make Zeta
your number-one choice!</i>

923
00:54:51,357 --> 00:54:53,746
The time is now.

924
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:25,371
Yeah.

925
00:55:26,399 --> 00:55:29,814
I've never seen anybody
get sacrificed before.

926
00:55:30,177 --> 00:55:31,936
That was so hot.

927
00:55:31,937 --> 00:55:35,039
<i>I mean, I don't know anything
about Aztecs, you know? R their culture.</i>

928
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:38,048
But, I mean, I do know that I had fun.

929
00:55:38,049 --> 00:55:42,555
<i>Yeah. I don't know anything
about them either, so that's awesome.</i>

930
00:55:49,281 --> 00:55:51,809
What have the Zetas become?

931
00:55:51,810 --> 00:55:53,535
Oh, my God.

932
00:55:53,570 --> 00:55:55,259
Popular.

933
00:56:13,989 --> 00:56:15,652
Remember, be sexy.

934
00:56:15,653 --> 00:56:18,371
<i>- He's gonna love your shoes.
- Deep breath, take a deep breath.</i>

935
00:56:18,372 --> 00:56:21,667
<i>Okay, okay, he's here. Okay.</i>

936
00:56:25,541 --> 00:56:27,109
- Hello.
- Hello.

937
00:56:27,110 --> 00:56:29,312
Wow, you look great.

938
00:56:29,477 --> 00:56:31,812
- Thank you.
- You ready?

939
00:56:36,806 --> 00:56:39,716
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

940
00:56:39,717 --> 00:56:43,580
- Would you mind if we walked?
- Oh, yes, I like to walk.

941
00:56:44,839 --> 00:56:47,334
<i>And that's not the only thing I like.</i>

942
00:56:47,335 --> 00:56:50,981
No? You have a wide range of interests?

943
00:56:50,982 --> 00:56:55,074
Oh, yes. A big range.

944
00:56:56,872 --> 00:56:59,175
Oh, wait here for a second.

945
00:56:59,176 --> 00:57:02,150
I think I dropped some money
over here the other day.

946
00:57:02,151 --> 00:57:04,711
<i>I just don't know
wherever could it be.</i>

947
00:57:04,712 --> 00:57:07,909
Maybe it's over here by this manhole.

948
00:57:10,312 --> 00:57:12,680
<i>That's fucking hot!</i>

949
00:57:13,928 --> 00:57:18,184
I just went over there
to look for my money...

950
00:57:18,185 --> 00:57:20,968
which I had dropped the other day.

951
00:57:20,969 --> 00:57:25,027
I think it was a dollar coin,
because I heard a clanging.

952
00:57:25,258 --> 00:57:28,291
But anyway, wow.

953
00:57:28,682 --> 00:57:31,049
Who knew steam can be hot?

954
00:57:31,050 --> 00:57:32,617
Yeah, that's...

955
00:57:32,618 --> 00:57:35,082
I wonder what they did
when Marilyn Monroe did it.

956
00:57:35,083 --> 00:57:39,946
They probably added soothing botanicals
to the steam rising from the manhole.

957
00:57:39,947 --> 00:57:41,610
I like that word.

958
00:57:41,611 --> 00:57:43,497
<i>"Manhole".</i>

959
00:57:44,588 --> 00:57:47,457
All right. What can I get you guys?

960
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:53,067
Instead of the mahi-mahi,
may I just get the one mahi,

961
00:57:53,068 --> 00:57:55,719
<i>because I'm not that hungry?</i>

962
00:57:55,948 --> 00:57:57,705
I'll ask.

963
00:57:59,117 --> 00:58:02,700
<i>The chicken piccata for me.
Yeah, that'd be fine.</i>

964
00:58:02,701 --> 00:58:04,332
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

965
00:58:04,333 --> 00:58:07,715
<i>"Piccata".
That's another word I like.</i>

966
00:58:08,205 --> 00:58:09,389
Piccata.

967
00:58:09,390 --> 00:58:11,755
<i>Yeah, it just rolls off the tongue,
doesn't it?</i>

968
00:58:11,756 --> 00:58:13,549
Sounds like "Hotta".

969
00:58:13,550 --> 00:58:14,989
Yeah.

970
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:17,739
<i>R "the Spanish Armada".</i>

971
00:58:18,766 --> 00:58:21,253
- I like to rhyme.
- Yeah?

972
00:58:22,575 --> 00:58:26,731
...and Stair-Master
to tone the buttock area.

973
00:58:26,990 --> 00:58:30,602
<i>I'd show you,
but who really wants to see my butt?</i>

974
00:58:32,368 --> 00:58:36,840
<i>I mean, it's just a silly old butt
with no tan lines.</i>

975
00:58:37,967 --> 00:58:39,407
Yep.

976
00:58:39,408 --> 00:58:44,264
<i>Wow, this was really good food.
I hope it doesn't go straight to my butt.</i>

977
00:58:44,785 --> 00:58:49,388
I mean, I think my butt would still
be a pretty good one, though.

978
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:52,166
Yep. My ass.

979
00:58:52,850 --> 00:58:54,480
Oh, well, this has been fun...

980
00:58:54,481 --> 00:58:59,238
but we should probably wrap it up,
because I've got another date at 11.

981
00:58:59,377 --> 00:59:00,465
Are you serious?

982
00:59:00,466 --> 00:59:03,979
<i>Well, what's a girl in demand
going to do?</i>

983
00:59:06,258 --> 00:59:07,505
Wow. Okay.

984
00:59:07,506 --> 00:59:10,290
<i>Yeah, well, dinner's on me.</i>

985
00:59:10,291 --> 00:59:15,026
<i>I'm gonna get going. I wouldn't want you
to keep the other guy waiting.</i>

986
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:17,330
Wait!

987
00:59:17,331 --> 00:59:20,177
Your biceps are huge! Kiss me.

988
00:59:25,428 --> 00:59:26,856
Oh, my God.

989
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:32,212
Yeah, right.

990
00:59:32,213 --> 00:59:34,003
<i>Shelley's back.</i>

991
00:59:34,004 --> 00:59:36,940
<i>- How'd it go?
- How'd it go, Shelley?</i>

992
00:59:37,685 --> 00:59:38,996
Not good.

993
00:59:38,997 --> 00:59:40,819
- What?
- Why?

994
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:42,772
<i>I don't think he likes me.</i>

995
00:59:42,773 --> 00:59:45,774
<i>He didn't fall for any of my tricks.</i>

996
00:59:46,069 --> 00:59:48,565
<i>That's impossible,
your tricks always work.</i>

997
00:59:48,566 --> 00:59:52,949
<i>I did sexy,
I did "other guys want me".</i>

998
00:59:52,950 --> 00:59:55,829
You know, I worked every angle in the book.

999
00:59:55,830 --> 00:59:58,831
<i>But I don't know, he just stared.</i>

1000
00:59:59,159 --> 01:00:01,653
What if Oliver is one of those guys...

1001
01:00:01,654 --> 01:00:04,758
who wants to have, like, a conversation
with a girl before he hooks up with her?

1002
01:00:04,759 --> 01:00:06,483
<i>He's gay?</i>

1003
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:08,818
<i>No, he's not gay.</i>

1004
01:00:09,528 --> 01:00:12,374
<i>Oh, I don't know.</i>

1005
01:00:14,871 --> 01:00:18,552
<i>I'm just saying, you know,
maybe he wants to talk first.</i>

1006
01:00:18,553 --> 01:00:21,902
<i>What if Oliver doesn't mind
a smart girl?</i>

1007
01:00:22,552 --> 01:00:24,526
- I know.
- Wait.

1008
01:00:25,144 --> 01:00:29,236
So I have to learn things
about things and stuff?

1009
01:00:29,625 --> 01:00:31,599
About topics?

1010
01:00:32,985 --> 01:00:35,225
- Can I even do that?
- Yeah. You can do that.

1011
01:00:35,226 --> 01:00:37,811
You can do anything
you set your mind to, Shelley.

1012
01:01:52,224 --> 01:01:54,912
<i>But you can't even tell
I have boobs.</i>

1013
01:01:54,913 --> 01:01:57,280
<i>Well, don't you think I should show him
a little something?</i>

1014
01:01:57,281 --> 01:01:59,616
Give him a little philanthropy?

1015
01:01:59,617 --> 01:02:02,560
Shelley, good job.
You used "philanthropy". That was fun.

1016
01:02:02,561 --> 01:02:05,408
You know what? You're still too sexy.

1017
01:02:05,409 --> 01:02:07,360
Nat, what if she wears your glasses?

1018
01:02:07,361 --> 01:02:10,077
Good idea. Okay, here.

1019
01:02:10,081 --> 01:02:12,022
Try these.

1020
01:02:13,602 --> 01:02:17,057
Oh, my God. Natalie, you should really
go to an eye doctor.

1021
01:02:17,058 --> 01:02:19,809
<i>That's actually
how I got those glasses.</i>

1022
01:02:19,810 --> 01:02:21,569
So have you called Oliver yet?

1023
01:02:21,570 --> 01:02:24,737
<i>Yes. He didn't seem too excited
to be going out on a second date...</i>

1024
01:02:24,738 --> 01:02:27,746
but he said yes, so here goes.

1025
01:02:27,747 --> 01:02:31,106
All right. Now remember,
just be yourself, only different.

1026
01:02:31,107 --> 01:02:33,411
<i>- Don't use the word "elucidate".
- Pretty much entirely different.</i>

1027
01:02:33,412 --> 01:02:35,202
<i>- You know what I'm talking about?
- Tone down the sexuality.</i>

1028
01:02:35,203 --> 01:02:37,955
<i>Talk about politics and religion.
That's always a really good first-date topic.</i>

1029
01:02:37,956 --> 01:02:40,355
<i>- Don't stare at him too much.
- Don't brush your teeth.</i>

1030
01:02:40,356 --> 01:02:41,699
- Bye, Shell.
- Bye.

1031
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:45,497
<i>- Don't forget to call, Shelley.
- Say you're nauseous.</i>

1032
01:02:45,924 --> 01:02:50,116
A nuclear nonproliferation treaty
should ease tension in Asia.

1033
01:02:50,117 --> 01:02:52,516
<i>Well, that's my thought.</i>

1034
01:02:52,517 --> 01:02:54,916
- Are you okay? With your...
- h, yes.

1035
01:02:54,917 --> 01:02:58,397
<i>These glasses don't make me dizzy
or anything.</i>

1036
01:02:58,630 --> 01:03:00,932
Elucidate on that.

1037
01:03:02,054 --> 01:03:05,765
Well, you seem to know a lot
about North Korea and the Middle East.

1038
01:03:05,766 --> 01:03:07,622
It sounds like you really read the paper.

1039
01:03:07,623 --> 01:03:11,782
Oh, all the time.
I am just nuts about the paper.

1040
01:03:11,783 --> 01:03:15,717
So, have you given any thought
to who you might be voting for?

1041
01:03:15,718 --> 01:03:17,889
<i>I'm not sure yet.</i>

1042
01:03:18,344 --> 01:03:22,087
<i>I definitely won't listen
to what Simon says.</i>

1043
01:03:22,088 --> 01:03:23,878
He is just so mean.

1044
01:03:23,879 --> 01:03:27,359
I usually always agree
with Paula and Randy.

1045
01:03:29,192 --> 01:03:33,055
Oh, you meant
the President of the United States.

1046
01:03:33,801 --> 01:03:36,484
The United States of America.

1047
01:03:36,617 --> 01:03:38,824
U.S.A. For short.

1048
01:03:38,825 --> 01:03:43,112
<i>Fifty states, if you include Hawaii.
Most people do. I'm definitely pro-Hawaii.</i>

1049
01:03:43,113 --> 01:03:44,809
- Excuse me.
- Oh, thank God.

1050
01:03:44,810 --> 01:03:46,504
Can I get you anything else?

1051
01:03:46,505 --> 01:03:48,489
No, I think we're good, thanks.

1052
01:03:48,490 --> 01:03:52,105
Hey, I know where I know you from.

1053
01:03:52,106 --> 01:03:55,585
<i>You were in Playboy.
"Girls with GEDs," right?</i>

1054
01:03:56,202 --> 01:03:58,111
Oh, heck, no!

1055
01:03:58,570 --> 01:03:59,658
No!

1056
01:03:59,659 --> 01:04:02,570
Those girls are all boobs and no brains.

1057
01:04:02,571 --> 01:04:07,082
<i>I'm too busy in a library,
reading books with dust on them.</i>

1058
01:04:07,083 --> 01:04:08,202
How...

1059
01:04:08,203 --> 01:04:10,379
Sorry. My mistake, then. Sorry.

1060
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:11,883
No.

1061
01:04:11,884 --> 01:04:15,812
<i>Playboy. God. Can you believe it?</i>

1062
01:04:16,301 --> 01:04:19,307
<i>I'm still hungry,
even though we just ate.</i>

1063
01:04:19,308 --> 01:04:22,636
<i>Oh, my gosh,
I can't believe I did that.</i>

1064
01:04:23,341 --> 01:04:26,957
<i>- Sorry, let me take care of that.
- It's okay. It's okay.</i>

1065
01:04:26,958 --> 01:04:28,748
Are those index cards?

1066
01:04:28,749 --> 01:04:31,532
No. Index... They're napkins.

1067
01:04:31,533 --> 01:04:34,948
They're not index cards
with writing on them.

1068
01:04:35,246 --> 01:04:37,741
Let me get some more napkins.

1069
01:04:37,742 --> 01:04:40,610
<i>That's okay, really. I think...</i>

1070
01:04:45,199 --> 01:04:47,086
Sweet balls!

1071
01:04:49,102 --> 01:04:50,765
<i>I can't believe that happened.</i>

1072
01:04:50,766 --> 01:04:54,030
<i>I'm sorry about all the gravity.</i>

1073
01:04:54,031 --> 01:04:56,169
Are you all right?

1074
01:05:03,184 --> 01:05:06,543
<i>I'm sorry, Oliver.</i>

1075
01:05:06,544 --> 01:05:08,301
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1076
01:05:08,529 --> 01:05:10,699
I need to go.

1077
01:05:26,578 --> 01:05:29,041
Come on, Puffin,
you've been in here for days.

1078
01:05:29,042 --> 01:05:32,588
<i>Let's watch a movie,
it'll make you feel better.</i>

1079
01:05:32,690 --> 01:05:34,418
<i>I don't get it.</i>

1080
01:05:34,419 --> 01:05:36,849
Why would Shelley just leave?

1081
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:39,154
<i>It's for the best.
She wasn't happy.</i>

1082
01:05:39,155 --> 01:05:42,930
I used to hear her crying
in her room late at night.

1083
01:05:43,347 --> 01:05:46,544
<i>I think I'd like to be alone
for a bit.</i>

1084
01:05:50,133 --> 01:05:52,522
I could stay with you.

1085
01:05:52,532 --> 01:05:55,400
No, just bring me more ice cream.

1086
01:05:55,924 --> 01:05:58,095
Egg! Paprika!

1087
01:05:58,740 --> 01:06:02,220
Nutmeg! Who cares? Who cares?

1088
01:06:02,614 --> 01:06:05,514
What have I done to poor Shelley?

1089
01:06:07,349 --> 01:06:08,948
You're not gonna tell him, are you?

1090
01:06:08,949 --> 01:06:10,773
No. You can't.

1091
01:06:10,774 --> 01:06:14,645
<i>I'm gonna be the next Miss November,
not that little blonde bitch.</i>

1092
01:06:14,646 --> 01:06:18,613
You found my weakness,
used it against me like kryptonite...

1093
01:06:18,614 --> 01:06:21,582
<i>but that's never gonna happen again.</i>

1094
01:06:22,039 --> 01:06:24,275
<i>"oh, Mr. Hefner.. ".</i>

1095
01:06:25,366 --> 01:06:28,530
Guys, remember, we only need 30, okay?

1096
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:31,286
First up,

1097
01:06:31,383 --> 01:06:32,564
Kristen Withers.

1098
01:06:32,599 --> 01:06:34,679
Pre-med, family in Greenwich.

1099
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:36,150
- Yeah, so cute.
- I like.

1100
01:06:36,151 --> 01:06:37,750
Cute, cute. Totally.

1101
01:06:37,751 --> 01:06:38,839
- No doubt.
- Very cute.

1102
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:40,375
- In.
- Guys...

1103
01:06:40,376 --> 01:06:43,605
We just made our first pledge acceptance.

1104
01:06:45,945 --> 01:06:48,919
Okay, cool. All right. Next up, Jill Palmer.

1105
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:53,145
Colorado, theater major...
Her father owns, like, half of Aspen.

1106
01:06:53,146 --> 01:06:54,836
- Yes.
- Yeah!

1107
01:07:02,202 --> 01:07:04,570
Why am I such a yummy dummy?

1108
01:07:04,571 --> 01:07:06,360
Next one.

1109
01:07:07,547 --> 01:07:11,703
Nancy Nagle. English major from Florida.

1110
01:07:12,027 --> 01:07:13,210
But she does drive a Porsche.

1111
01:07:13,211 --> 01:07:16,443
<i>I just don't know about this one.
I kind of feel like we've created this image.</i>

1112
01:07:16,444 --> 01:07:18,745
<i>I just don't feel like
she's gonna fit in.</i>

1113
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:27,835
<i>I'm just saying, she should have spent
the Porsche money on a nose job.</i>

1114
01:07:27,836 --> 01:07:30,331
<i>She said she broke it in a skiing accident
last year, and I'm like...</i>

1115
01:07:30,332 --> 01:07:33,883
<i>"kay, I'm sure the nose surgeon would
take the Porsche as a trade-in".</i>

1116
01:07:33,884 --> 01:07:35,826
Booya! Snap!

1117
01:07:41,117 --> 01:07:42,172
Hello?

1118
01:07:42,173 --> 01:07:44,060
<i>Hey, Shelley, it's me.</i>

1119
01:07:44,061 --> 01:07:45,949
<i>- Hef?
- Yeah.</i>

1120
01:07:45,950 --> 01:07:49,021
Hef? Oh, is this you? Oh, my gosh.

1121
01:07:49,022 --> 01:07:51,837
<i>How are you?
Like, I can't believe you're calling me.</i>

1122
01:07:51,838 --> 01:07:54,942
How is everybody at the Mansion?
How are things?

1123
01:07:54,943 --> 01:07:58,270
<i>Good news. I'm gonna make you
next month's centerfold.</i>

1124
01:07:58,271 --> 01:08:00,062
You're making me Miss November?

1125
01:08:00,063 --> 01:08:02,206
<i>- That's right.
- Oh, my gosh.</i>

1126
01:08:02,207 --> 01:08:04,862
Are you totally serious,
or is this not Hef?

1127
01:08:04,863 --> 01:08:07,519
<i>If this is Hef, blink once.
If it isn't Hef, blink twice.</i>

1128
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:09,429
Did you blink?

1129
01:08:10,016 --> 01:08:12,511
<i>I'm so glad you haven't changed,
Shelley.</i>

1130
01:08:12,546 --> 01:08:15,007
And I want you to move
back to the Mansion.

1131
01:08:15,008 --> 01:08:18,139
<i>It's just not the same
without you here.</i>

1132
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:21,088
<i>Hef, I just can't believe it.</i>

1133
01:08:21,089 --> 01:08:22,176
<i>Believe it, baby.</i>

1134
01:08:22,177 --> 01:08:24,063
<i>Okay, here's what happens.</i>

1135
01:08:24,064 --> 01:08:27,424
<i>We shoot the pictorial, we'll have you do
a 25-city tour of the United States.</i>

1136
01:08:27,425 --> 01:08:29,601
<i>And then from there
we're gonna travel Europe...</i>

1137
01:08:29,602 --> 01:08:31,457
<i>ending with a one-week stay in Monaco.</i>

1138
01:08:31,458 --> 01:08:33,025
<i>We're gonna coordinate
your pictorial...</i>

1139
01:08:33,026 --> 01:08:36,032
<i>with a Playboy Channel documentary
on the life of a centerfold.</i>

1140
01:08:36,033 --> 01:08:38,817
<i>The exposure's going to be wonderful,
but it doesn't stop there.</i>

1141
01:08:38,818 --> 01:08:41,185
<i>We're going to pull out all the stops
for this one, Shelley.</i>

1142
01:08:41,186 --> 01:08:42,626
<i>It's going to be huge.</i>

1143
01:08:42,627 --> 01:08:44,065
Hef?

1144
01:08:44,066 --> 01:08:45,974
<i>Yeah, baby?</i>

1145
01:08:47,075 --> 01:08:49,346
<i>Hef, I'm so sorry.</i>

1146
01:08:49,347 --> 01:08:52,194
<i>I'm so happy that you called me.</i>

1147
01:08:52,740 --> 01:08:54,786
<i>And I love you,
but I don't think I can do it.</i>

1148
01:08:54,787 --> 01:08:56,835
<i>I can't leave my Zeta girls.</i>

1149
01:08:56,870 --> 01:08:58,526
What?

1150
01:08:58,787 --> 01:09:01,155
<i>I'm not going anywhere.</i>

1151
01:09:02,661 --> 01:09:04,482
<i>I'm home.</i>

1152
01:09:07,684 --> 01:09:10,303
Katootoo Jihiman.

1153
01:09:10,565 --> 01:09:13,508
Sociology major from India. Everyone?

1154
01:09:13,509 --> 01:09:15,717
I remember this one.
She seems kind of weird.

1155
01:09:15,751 --> 01:09:16,868
I actually got that, too.

1156
01:09:16,869 --> 01:09:19,525
<i>Not like an "I live in the wall
and eat crickets" kind of weird...</i>

1157
01:09:19,526 --> 01:09:21,029
but just like a little off.

1158
01:09:21,030 --> 01:09:23,811
- Boo to Katootoo.
- Next.

1159
01:09:24,518 --> 01:09:27,452
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

1160
01:09:27,877 --> 01:09:28,933
Lilly?

1161
01:09:28,934 --> 01:09:30,694
Look at you people!

1162
01:09:30,695 --> 01:09:33,510
Honestly,
is this really what you've become?

1163
01:09:33,511 --> 01:09:36,998
Judging other girls on their appearance?
Calling them weird?

1164
01:09:36,999 --> 01:09:39,494
<i>I'm sure glad I joined when I did,
because honestly...</i>

1165
01:09:39,495 --> 01:09:41,574
<i>I don't think
I would make the cut these days.</i>

1166
01:09:41,575 --> 01:09:43,527
And neither would a lot of you.

1167
01:09:43,528 --> 01:09:47,399
<i>I can't believe that Zeta's become
just like Phi lota Mu.</i>

1168
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:50,018
A bunch of snooty bitches!

1169
01:09:51,112 --> 01:09:53,218
Lilly, you talked.

1170
01:09:53,289 --> 01:09:55,427
And you're British?

1171
01:10:08,554 --> 01:10:11,040
<i>Hi, everybody. I'm home.</i>

1172
01:10:11,945 --> 01:10:13,641
This is all your fault.

1173
01:10:13,642 --> 01:10:15,657
Yeah. You know what, Mona?
You're right.

1174
01:10:15,658 --> 01:10:18,890
It all started with this fake hair
and your stupid water bras.

1175
01:10:18,891 --> 01:10:21,353
You know what?
Before you got here, we were individuals.

1176
01:10:21,354 --> 01:10:23,465
You've turned us all into stupid bimbos.

1177
01:10:23,466 --> 01:10:25,418
- We were fine the way we were.
- We look ridiculous.

1178
01:10:25,419 --> 01:10:27,435
<i>- I'm getting Cs in all my classes.
- Why am I looking like this?</i>

1179
01:10:27,470 --> 01:10:28,519
<i>This isn't who I am.</i>

1180
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:29,834
I can't believe
you let me do this to myself.

1181
01:10:29,835 --> 01:10:32,074
Guys, stop. Come on, stop, stop.

1182
01:10:32,075 --> 01:10:33,602
Guys.

1183
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:38,792
<i>I understand, and I'm sorry.</i>

1184
01:10:40,044 --> 01:10:42,017
So I...

1185
01:10:42,604 --> 01:10:44,587
Thank you guys for everything.

1186
01:10:44,588 --> 01:10:48,865
<i>I'm gonna go, and I really hope
to see you guys in the future.</i>

1187
01:10:49,741 --> 01:10:51,431
Shelley.

1188
01:11:01,070 --> 01:11:02,797
<i>Hi, Hef, it's Shelley.</i>

1189
01:11:02,798 --> 01:11:05,037
I was just kidding, silly.

1190
01:11:05,038 --> 01:11:09,097
<i>I can't wait to be back
at the Mansion and be a centerfold.</i>

1191
01:11:09,167 --> 01:11:12,135
This is the happiest day of my life.

1192
01:11:13,072 --> 01:11:14,318
<i>Dear Oliver...</i>

1193
01:11:14,319 --> 01:11:16,942
<i>I'm so sorry I couldn't tell you
this in person.</i>

1194
01:11:16,943 --> 01:11:20,175
<i>It was way too embarrassing
to face you after everything.</i>

1195
01:11:20,176 --> 01:11:24,135
<i>I am leaving the Zeta house
to fulfill my lifelong dream.</i>

1196
01:11:24,336 --> 01:11:29,071
<i>And I know that what I've decided to do
won't make any sense to you at all...</i>

1197
01:11:29,072 --> 01:11:30,864
<i>but I have joined the Peace Corps...</i>

1198
01:11:30,865 --> 01:11:35,370
and I'm going off to work in the mountains
of a country called Peru.

1199
01:11:36,273 --> 01:11:38,960
<i>I'm going to meet lots
of interesting people.</i>

1200
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:41,265
<i>I'm sure it'll be very hot
where I'm going.</i>

1201
01:11:41,266 --> 01:11:42,929
<i>And even though it's going to be super-hot,</i>

1202
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:46,800
<i>I will be bundled up in clothes,
barely showing any flesh.</i>

1203
01:11:46,801 --> 01:11:48,849
<i>I only tell you that because
I don't want you to worry...</i>

1204
01:11:48,850 --> 01:11:51,370
<i>about me getting sunburned.</i>

1205
01:11:52,435 --> 01:11:56,049
Hef told me what you did, and I don't think
it was very sisterly of you.

1206
01:11:56,050 --> 01:11:58,352
You are so vapid.

1207
01:11:58,899 --> 01:12:03,787
Actually, I'm ingenious and philanthropic,
and you're a backstabbing bitch.

1208
01:12:04,852 --> 01:12:07,314
- Nice, Shelley. That was awesome.
- Shelley!

1209
01:12:07,315 --> 01:12:10,386
<i>I hope everybody at the old folks' home
is doing great.</i>

1210
01:12:10,387 --> 01:12:13,683
<i>And as for the Zeta girls,
I'm sure they're doing fine.</i>

1211
01:12:13,684 --> 01:12:17,555
<i>Oliver, I hope you think of me
every once in a while, and when you do...</i>

1212
01:12:17,556 --> 01:12:19,476
<i>I hope they are good thoughts.</i>

1213
01:12:19,477 --> 01:12:20,563
Pooter!

1214
01:12:20,564 --> 01:12:22,637
<i>Love, Shelley.</i>

1215
01:12:23,285 --> 01:12:25,423
There you are.

1216
01:12:26,805 --> 01:12:30,830
So we'll be half Shelley
and half who we really are.

1217
01:12:31,221 --> 01:12:33,301
Can we be 60% Shelley?

1218
01:12:33,302 --> 01:12:36,405
I mean, say what you want about her,
but the girl had style.

1219
01:12:36,406 --> 01:12:39,477
<i>- What?
- "She had style"?</i>

1220
01:12:39,478 --> 01:12:42,901
She still does. I mean, she just wants
to be back at the Playboy Mansion.

1221
01:12:42,902 --> 01:12:45,301
Well, whatever we're gonna be,
we need to figure out, you guys.

1222
01:12:45,302 --> 01:12:50,070
We still need 30 pledges by ctober 15th,
or we can just kiss it all goodbye.

1223
01:12:50,071 --> 01:12:53,014
Who wants to be a part of something real?
Zeta.

1224
01:12:53,015 --> 01:12:55,092
Hi. Zeta. Tell 29 of your friends.

1225
01:12:55,127 --> 01:12:59,223
Listen up, ladies! Zeta was founded
on the tenets of sisterhood,

1226
01:12:59,224 --> 01:13:01,047
friendship and philanthropy.

1227
01:13:01,048 --> 01:13:02,167
Here you go.

1228
01:13:02,168 --> 01:13:05,335
Yeah, and since then, we've added some
pretty kick-ass parties to the list.

1229
01:13:05,336 --> 01:13:07,191
Yeah, but instead of judging
and rejecting...

1230
01:13:07,192 --> 01:13:10,168
we'll put all the pledges we get
into a bowl, and we'll draw 30 names out.

1231
01:13:10,169 --> 01:13:12,632
<i>Natalie? What'd you do to your hair?</i>

1232
01:13:12,633 --> 01:13:15,032
- I could change it back.
- Why?

1233
01:13:15,033 --> 01:13:16,569
Everyone gets haircuts.

1234
01:13:16,570 --> 01:13:19,785
People have lots of different styles
all over the world.

1235
01:13:19,820 --> 01:13:23,000
In China, they usually tend
to layer it, I've noticed.

1236
01:13:23,001 --> 01:13:26,041
<i>This isn't China, though. So, I just...
You know, I could put it back to how it was.</i>

1237
01:13:26,042 --> 01:13:29,042
Oh, no, no. Why, why, why? You look great.

1238
01:13:29,851 --> 01:13:31,642
- I do?
- Yeah.

1239
01:13:31,643 --> 01:13:33,977
Well, I mean, you looked great before,
with the hair.

1240
01:13:33,978 --> 01:13:37,306
But, I mean, this feels more you.

1241
01:13:37,307 --> 01:13:40,090
I mean, besides, it's not like
I want you to be my girlfriend...

1242
01:13:40,091 --> 01:13:42,938
just because of your hairstyle. So...

1243
01:13:42,939 --> 01:13:44,730
Your girlfriend?

1244
01:13:44,731 --> 01:13:47,771
<i>Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...</i>

1245
01:13:47,772 --> 01:13:48,891
<i>It's kind of presumptuous.</i>

1246
01:13:48,892 --> 01:13:51,803
<i>It's like, "Hey, you wanna be
my girlfriend? Sit next to me".</i>

1247
01:13:51,804 --> 01:13:53,787
<i>No, no. I mean,
you don't wanna be my girlfriend.</i>

1248
01:13:53,788 --> 01:13:56,955
<i>You got guys falling from trees for you,
and it's like...</i>

1249
01:13:56,956 --> 01:14:00,087
Here I am, just a goofy dude.

1250
01:14:00,893 --> 01:14:02,802
<i>"Goofy dude"?</i>

1251
01:14:04,413 --> 01:14:10,011
Colby, I want to be your girlfriend more
than an electron wants to attach to a proton.

1252
01:14:10,814 --> 01:14:13,595
- That much?
- Yeah.

1253
01:14:17,406 --> 01:14:18,966
Yeah?

1254
01:14:25,566 --> 01:14:27,198
What? What?

1255
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:30,558
Did I mess that up?
Because I can do that so much better.

1256
01:14:30,559 --> 01:14:34,399
No, I was just thanking Shelley.

1257
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:36,701
Oh. Thank you, Shelley.

1258
01:14:44,449 --> 01:14:47,295
Okay, guys. Close your eyes.

1259
01:14:51,969 --> 01:14:54,689
This is it. We're gonna keep the Zeta house.

1260
01:14:54,690 --> 01:14:57,920
- Oh, my gosh.
- Go, Zeta! Go, Zeta! Go, Zeta! Go, Zeta!

1261
01:14:57,921 --> 01:14:59,579
Lilly, go mail the bids.

1262
01:15:07,107 --> 01:15:08,600
Hi.

1263
01:15:08,803 --> 01:15:10,402
Are you new on campus?

1264
01:15:10,403 --> 01:15:12,162
<i>I don't think we've ever met.</i>

1265
01:15:12,163 --> 01:15:14,650
<i>I'm Cole. Cole Trickle.</i>

1266
01:15:16,739 --> 01:15:19,869
Yes. Yes, I just transferred.

1267
01:15:20,515 --> 01:15:22,719
My name is Lilly.

1268
01:15:23,619 --> 01:15:25,376
- Hi.
- Hi.

1269
01:15:25,733 --> 01:15:27,876
That girl over there just
dropped these on the floor,

1270
01:15:27,911 --> 01:15:30,144
<i>and she's really into that guy.</i>

1271
01:15:30,179 --> 01:15:32,403
<i>- And I don't want to interrupt her.
- Okay.</i>

1272
01:15:32,438 --> 01:15:34,627
- Can you mail these out for her?
- Sure thing.

1273
01:15:34,628 --> 01:15:36,164
Thank you.

1274
01:15:36,165 --> 01:15:39,301
You should totally
mail me your number sometime.

1275
01:15:39,302 --> 01:15:40,836
Okay.

1276
01:15:40,837 --> 01:15:44,100
Just give it to me.
I have a great memory.

1277
01:15:44,166 --> 01:15:45,733
Where are my envelopes?

1278
01:15:45,734 --> 01:15:49,445
Oh, you dropped them, but I got it,
and they're gonna be mailed right out.

1279
01:15:49,446 --> 01:15:51,653
Oh, thank you so much.

1280
01:15:51,654 --> 01:15:56,128
<i>- Okay, my number's 7-6...
- Anyways, it was great meeting you, Nelly.</i>

1281
01:15:56,327 --> 01:15:58,630
Oh, but my name is Lilly, actually.

1282
01:15:58,631 --> 01:16:00,637
Yeah, whatever.

1283
01:16:01,127 --> 01:16:02,784
Bye.

1284
01:16:04,391 --> 01:16:06,247
Now can I see your pizzanties?

1285
01:16:06,248 --> 01:16:07,775
No.

1286
01:16:18,217 --> 01:16:19,528
<i>I don't get it.</i>

1287
01:16:19,529 --> 01:16:22,180
<i>Why didn't anyone show up?</i>

1288
01:16:23,144 --> 01:16:26,144
You guys, come here and look at this.

1289
01:16:30,377 --> 01:16:33,856
<i>I'm Ashley. Come on in.
Nice to meet you guys.</i>

1290
01:16:37,450 --> 01:16:39,689
<i>You did send out the invitations,
didn't you?</i>

1291
01:16:39,690 --> 01:16:41,381
Yes.

1292
01:16:41,867 --> 01:16:43,434
But there was this boy there.

1293
01:16:43,435 --> 01:16:45,866
And I never talked to a boy before.
You know?

1294
01:16:45,867 --> 01:16:48,394
And he distracted me. Just for a minute.

1295
01:16:48,395 --> 01:16:50,698
And then I saw him talking to Ashley.

1296
01:16:50,699 --> 01:16:53,610
And they knew each other. I could tell
by the way that they talked, and...

1297
01:16:53,611 --> 01:16:55,268
And...

1298
01:16:56,811 --> 01:16:58,633
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1299
01:17:09,645 --> 01:17:11,561
<i>People, all right.
That's enough. Let's go.</i>

1300
01:17:11,596 --> 01:17:14,509
<i>We're done. We're shooting Miss November,
not Miss December. Let's do this.</i>

1301
01:17:14,510 --> 01:17:17,100
<i>Give me the fog. Wind, let's go.
Music, let's go.</i>

1302
01:17:17,101 --> 01:17:21,029
<i>Let's shoot this. Miss November.
Immortality! Let's go!</i>

1303
01:17:21,326 --> 01:17:24,013
<i>All right, here we go. It's Shelley time.
Come on, Shelley, it's so hot.</i>

1304
01:17:24,014 --> 01:17:26,605
<i>Oh, yeah. Sexy.
Sell it, Shelley. Oh, my gosh.</i>

1305
01:17:26,606 --> 01:17:28,397
<i>You're gorgeous, Shelley. So hot!</i>

1306
01:17:28,398 --> 01:17:30,861
<i>Come on, work it, Shelley!
Come on, let's see some...</i>

1307
01:17:30,862 --> 01:17:31,917
<i>Shelley?</i>

1308
01:17:31,918 --> 01:17:34,638
<i>Stop. Stop the fog, Dave.
Barry, hold the wind, please.</i>

1309
01:17:34,639 --> 01:17:37,390
<i>What's wrong, babe?
You okay? You sad? Sad monkey?</i>

1310
01:17:37,391 --> 01:17:39,182
<i>I don't think I'm your Miss November.</i>

1311
01:17:39,183 --> 01:17:40,940
<i>What?</i>

1312
01:17:41,871 --> 01:17:43,725
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1313
01:17:44,944 --> 01:17:48,016
<i>Shelley, wait. Shelley.
Shelley, come on. Shelley...</i>

1314
01:17:48,017 --> 01:17:49,902
<i>Is she serious?</i>

1315
01:17:49,903 --> 01:17:51,887
<i>Shelley! Shell-monkey!</i>

1316
01:17:51,888 --> 01:17:54,790
<i>Should we take a shower
and talk about it? Shelley!</i>

1317
01:18:01,201 --> 01:18:02,672
Natalie?

1318
01:18:02,673 --> 01:18:05,712
Oh, my gosh. How did you find me?

1319
01:18:05,713 --> 01:18:08,849
Oh, just... A little bird told me.

1320
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:10,416
What bird?

1321
01:18:10,417 --> 01:18:12,881
Marvin called us. I thought...

1322
01:18:12,882 --> 01:18:14,513
<i>We didn't think you liked us anymore.</i>

1323
01:18:14,514 --> 01:18:17,874
Oh, my gosh, no. I've missed you so much.

1324
01:18:17,875 --> 01:18:20,305
Oh, hi, girls. Oh, my gosh.

1325
01:18:20,306 --> 01:18:22,193
You guys look beautiful!

1326
01:18:22,194 --> 01:18:24,530
Oh, I've missed you guys so much.

1327
01:18:24,531 --> 01:18:26,354
<i>You're the best housemother
anyone's ever had.</i>

1328
01:18:26,355 --> 01:18:28,531
<i>I'm really sorry
for what I said to you.</i>

1329
01:18:28,532 --> 01:18:30,067
I know. We really miss you, Shelley.

1330
01:18:30,068 --> 01:18:31,442
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1331
01:18:31,443 --> 01:18:34,899
<i>So, how'd the rest of rush go?
Did you guys get your pledges?</i>

1332
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:38,196
<i>Zeta had a ton of people interested,
don't get me wrong. Thanks to you.</i>

1333
01:18:38,197 --> 01:18:41,268
But nobody showed up
because Ashley stole all of our bids.

1334
01:18:41,269 --> 01:18:43,891
No. So the house is gone?

1335
01:18:43,892 --> 01:18:45,204
They'll make it official today

1336
01:18:45,205 --> 01:18:47,892
at the Panhellenic Council meeting
this afternoon.

1337
01:18:47,893 --> 01:18:49,684
<i>So there's still a chance.</i>

1338
01:18:49,685 --> 01:18:50,740
<i>Shelley, it's too late.</i>

1339
01:18:50,741 --> 01:18:53,140
<i>I mean, I don't think there's anything
that we can do.</i>

1340
01:18:53,141 --> 01:18:56,621
Natalie! Together we can do anything!

1341
01:18:57,365 --> 01:19:00,431
<i>Today's meeting is tinged with sadness.</i>

1342
01:19:00,438 --> 01:19:05,358
<i>Unfortunately, not all of us will be
returning next year.</i>

1343
01:19:05,718 --> 01:19:11,021
Yes, that's true. So with that said,
that brings us to our last order of business.

1344
01:19:12,471 --> 01:19:13,814
Stop!

1345
01:19:13,815 --> 01:19:14,963
Oh, dear.

1346
01:19:14,998 --> 01:19:17,078
We're here to save our house.

1347
01:19:17,079 --> 01:19:20,631
<i>I don't know how this
big meeting stuff works, but I just...</i>

1348
01:19:20,632 --> 01:19:22,167
<i>Enough with the freak show.</i>

1349
01:19:22,168 --> 01:19:25,975
<i>What I was saying, before I was
so rudely interrupted, is that...</i>

1350
01:19:25,976 --> 01:19:28,365
Hold on! Wait.

1351
01:19:30,937 --> 01:19:33,391
I have something to say.

1352
01:19:40,250 --> 01:19:42,617
Shelley, say something.

1353
01:19:42,618 --> 01:19:44,345
<i>I'm allergic to erythromycin.</i>

1354
01:19:44,346 --> 01:19:48,313
<i>Oh, for God's sake, Dean Simmons.
Enough is enough. Do something.</i>

1355
01:19:48,314 --> 01:19:52,378
<i>Shelley? The council has come here today
to really finalize this, so...</i>

1356
01:19:52,379 --> 01:19:56,761
No! No! This is germane to our predicament.

1357
01:19:56,762 --> 01:20:01,050
<i>Oh, well, as long as it's germane.
Please continue.</i>

1358
01:20:01,051 --> 01:20:03,440
Just give her a minute.

1359
01:20:04,763 --> 01:20:08,024
<i>I'm allergic to erythromycin.</i>

1360
01:20:08,827 --> 01:20:13,334
I took it once when I had a cold.
I was 16, and it gave me itching.

1361
01:20:13,564 --> 01:20:17,659
I mean, everything itched.
My legs, my arms, my earlobes.

1362
01:20:17,660 --> 01:20:20,764
<i>And other stuff, too, but I can't say,
because I'm live on the air right now...</i>

1363
01:20:20,765 --> 01:20:23,132
<i>and you can't say "ass cheeks," right?</i>

1364
01:20:23,133 --> 01:20:25,042
<i>You just did.</i>

1365
01:20:25,245 --> 01:20:28,408
But I said it kind of quietly, I think.

1366
01:20:29,885 --> 01:20:35,221
But besides the itching,
the erythromycin also made my skin glow.

1367
01:20:35,678 --> 01:20:38,398
It gave me, like, this glowing tan.

1368
01:20:38,399 --> 01:20:41,595
And I suddenly felt like another person.

1369
01:20:41,726 --> 01:20:43,580
Different.

1370
01:20:43,807 --> 01:20:45,563
Better.

1371
01:20:45,791 --> 01:20:48,063
Prettier, I guess.

1372
01:20:48,064 --> 01:20:51,030
<i>- What's your name?
- Michelle.</i>

1373
01:20:51,295 --> 01:20:52,478
Michelle.

1374
01:20:52,479 --> 01:20:55,167
<i>Michelle, do you know that feeling
that I'm talking about?</i>

1375
01:20:55,168 --> 01:20:56,383
Where you suddenly feel pretty...

1376
01:20:56,384 --> 01:20:58,976
and, next thing you know,
you feel better about yourself?

1377
01:20:58,977 --> 01:21:01,343
Well, that was what was happening to me.

1378
01:21:01,344 --> 01:21:04,543
My allergic reaction made me feel pretty...

1379
01:21:04,544 --> 01:21:09,248
and so I ignored all the bad side effects,
because suddenly people were talking to me...

1380
01:21:09,249 --> 01:21:11,104
and they were noticing me.

1381
01:21:11,105 --> 01:21:14,144
And even though I was itching like crazy...

1382
01:21:14,145 --> 01:21:17,308
it was worth it to feel accepted.

1383
01:21:17,762 --> 01:21:22,332
<i>And so I couldn't wait to get a cold
so I could take my erythromycin.</i>

1384
01:21:24,322 --> 01:21:29,406
But underneath that beautiful, glowing skin,
I still had that cold.

1385
01:21:30,499 --> 01:21:33,345
<i>Well, that's a meteor.</i>

1386
01:21:33,858 --> 01:21:36,193
<i>The word is "Metaphor".</i>

1387
01:21:36,707 --> 01:21:39,259
<i>Can you really be that dumb?</i>

1388
01:21:39,523 --> 01:21:41,858
<i>She's not dumb.</i>

1389
01:21:42,084 --> 01:21:44,254
Thank you, Natalie.

1390
01:21:45,635 --> 01:21:49,181
And, Mrs. Hagstrom, I meant "Meteor".

1391
01:21:49,861 --> 01:21:53,722
It flashes by and burns bright,
but then it disappears.

1392
01:21:54,244 --> 01:21:57,091
And that was what was happening to me.

1393
01:21:57,092 --> 01:21:59,906
The real me just disappeared.

1394
01:22:00,901 --> 01:22:03,290
<i>Is anyone buying this?</i>

1395
01:22:03,813 --> 01:22:06,561
I am not an expert speech-giver.

1396
01:22:07,429 --> 01:22:11,013
But I do know that one day,
when your looks are gone,

1397
01:22:11,014 --> 01:22:14,533
if everything you have is based on looks,
well, then you've got nothing.

1398
01:22:14,534 --> 01:22:17,702
You need your friends
and your family by your side...

1399
01:22:17,703 --> 01:22:21,414
to love you for who you are,
not what you look like.

1400
01:22:21,415 --> 01:22:25,094
<i>At the Zeta house, our new motto is,
"Be who you are".</i>

1401
01:22:25,095 --> 01:22:27,429
Because we're a family.

1402
01:22:27,559 --> 01:22:31,684
We're a family
that loves you on the inside.

1403
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:37,826
So we need you to stand forward
and be a part of that family.

1404
01:22:38,152 --> 01:22:42,631
We need 30 people right now
to stand forward and pledge Zeta!

1405
01:22:42,632 --> 01:22:45,960
<i>Hey, honey!
You had me at "itchy ass cheeks". I'm in.</i>

1406
01:22:45,961 --> 01:22:47,912
Me too! Me too!

1407
01:22:47,913 --> 01:22:49,636
Me too!

1408
01:22:50,121 --> 01:22:51,688
- I'll be a Zeta!
- Me, too!

1409
01:22:51,689 --> 01:22:53,481
- Me, too.
- I'll pledge!

1410
01:22:53,482 --> 01:22:56,970
- Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven!
- Me, too!

1411
01:22:56,971 --> 01:22:59,785
- I'll pledge!
- Twelve! Thirteen! Come on, we need 30.

1412
01:22:59,786 --> 01:23:01,257
- I'll do it!
- Fourteen.

1413
01:23:01,258 --> 01:23:03,465
- Get your hand down.
- Fifteen. Sixteen.

1414
01:23:03,466 --> 01:23:06,343
Seventeen, 18, 19, 20.
Excellent! Twenty-one!

1415
01:23:06,378 --> 01:23:09,194
- Twenty-two. Twenty-three. Come on!
- I'll be in Zeta!

1416
01:23:09,195 --> 01:23:11,210
- Twenty-four, 25.
- Up here! Pick me!

1417
01:23:11,211 --> 01:23:13,322
Twenty-six, on top.
Thank you. Twenty-seven.

1418
01:23:13,323 --> 01:23:15,659
New pledger, right there.
Come on, two more!

1419
01:23:15,660 --> 01:23:17,259
Twenty-eight, 29!

1420
01:23:17,260 --> 01:23:19,466
Need more. Just need one more.
Come on, everybody.

1421
01:23:19,467 --> 01:23:22,955
Need more. Need more. Get your hand up.
Come on! Be a Zeta.

1422
01:23:22,990 --> 01:23:24,267
Come on!

1423
01:23:24,268 --> 01:23:27,499
Come on! Come on, one more!
Just need one more Zeta.

1424
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:29,481
Need more, one more. Come on!

1425
01:23:29,516 --> 01:23:31,884
Pound the gavel!
Why are you dragging this out?

1426
01:23:31,885 --> 01:23:33,292
<i>There's nobody else! It's over.</i>

1427
01:23:33,293 --> 01:23:36,162
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha on you, Zetas.

1428
01:23:38,413 --> 01:23:40,235
Wait!

1429
01:23:40,749 --> 01:23:43,236
<i>There's one more new Zeta!</i>

1430
01:23:51,726 --> 01:23:53,613
No. Sorry.

1431
01:23:53,870 --> 01:23:57,198
<i>Can't be a baby pledging a sorority.
You gotta be a student.</i>

1432
01:23:57,199 --> 01:23:58,510
<i>That's right!</i>

1433
01:23:58,511 --> 01:24:01,550
Rules are rules. Oh, well. Bye-bye.

1434
01:24:01,551 --> 01:24:03,662
Time to pound that gavel.
Meeting adjourned.

1435
01:24:03,663 --> 01:24:06,447
Dunzo. Pound that gavel, Dean.

1436
01:24:06,448 --> 01:24:09,903
<i>I'm really very sorry, girls.
I know how hard you've worked for this.</i>

1437
01:24:09,904 --> 01:24:11,856
It hurts me to do this, but I...

1438
01:24:11,857 --> 01:24:15,467
Stop! I would like to pledge Zeta.

1439
01:24:15,568 --> 01:24:16,815
What?

1440
01:24:16,816 --> 01:24:19,280
I like everything that Shelley said.

1441
01:24:19,281 --> 01:24:21,736
Are you out of your mind?

1442
01:24:22,449 --> 01:24:26,800
And, God, do you know
how sick to death I am of you?

1443
01:24:26,801 --> 01:24:28,848
F... Phi Betha Mu?

1444
01:24:28,849 --> 01:24:31,249
I've been in Phi Betha Mu hell!

1445
01:24:31,250 --> 01:24:33,639
I want to be a Zeta.

1446
01:24:36,594 --> 01:24:38,251
No!

1447
01:24:43,603 --> 01:24:45,873
Okay, so Zetas keep their house.

1448
01:24:45,874 --> 01:24:47,980
Meeting adjourned.

1449
01:24:48,115 --> 01:24:51,464
Now, go study something.

1450
01:24:55,027 --> 01:24:56,946
What are we supposed to do now?

1451
01:24:56,947 --> 01:24:59,151
<i>Let's start with this.</i>

1452
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:09,171
Oh, I love my weird home.

1453
01:25:09,172 --> 01:25:10,420
Things that I like!

1454
01:25:10,421 --> 01:25:13,487
Ottoman! Oh, I love you, Ottoman.

1455
01:25:13,685 --> 01:25:16,181
- This house is so nice!
- I know.

1456
01:25:16,182 --> 01:25:18,197
I mean, so cool.

1457
01:25:18,198 --> 01:25:21,173
- Hey, do you want me to show you upstairs?
- Yes! Show me, show me, show me.

1458
01:25:21,174 --> 01:25:22,837
This is so great.

1459
01:25:22,838 --> 01:25:25,806
Everything worked out so perfectly.

1460
01:25:26,327 --> 01:25:28,853
Well, not perfectly.

1461
01:25:28,854 --> 01:25:33,750
I mean, I messed up things with Oliver
because I moved to Peru and left him a note.

1462
01:25:33,751 --> 01:25:36,502
<i>Well, Shelley,
you didn't really move to Peru.</i>

1463
01:25:36,503 --> 01:25:39,121
I know that, but he doesn't.

1464
01:25:40,919 --> 01:25:42,708
Oliver.

1465
01:25:43,927 --> 01:25:48,913
I was literally just talking about you.
How did you know that I got back?

1466
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:52,465
<i>Let's just say a little bird told me.</i>

1467
01:25:53,176 --> 01:25:55,990
<i>I gotta meet this frickin' bird!</i>

1468
01:25:56,729 --> 01:25:58,736
<i>It's me, Shell.</i>

1469
01:25:59,033 --> 01:26:02,327
<i>I'm the bird. I called Oliver.</i>

1470
01:26:03,897 --> 01:26:05,719
Thank you.

1471
01:26:05,817 --> 01:26:09,047
<i>It's so great to have such nice friends.</i>

1472
01:26:10,746 --> 01:26:14,617
And, Oliver, I have to admit,
I never went to Peru.

1473
01:26:14,618 --> 01:26:16,858
- I know.
- Thank you.

1474
01:26:16,859 --> 01:26:18,865
You're welcome.

1475
01:26:19,003 --> 01:26:20,954
<i>And I was in Playboy.</i>

1476
01:26:20,955 --> 01:26:24,217
<i>I know that, too. And I don't care.</i>

1477
01:26:25,275 --> 01:26:27,546
I would like to try this again.

1478
01:26:27,547 --> 01:26:32,304
Except this time,
no manhole covers or bubble gum.

1479
01:26:32,603 --> 01:26:36,182
You know, just see where this goes.

1480
01:26:36,220 --> 01:26:37,845
Yes.

1481
01:26:38,204 --> 01:26:40,921
<i>- I'd like that.
- Great.</i>

1482
01:26:43,164 --> 01:26:44,762
Oliver.

1483
01:26:44,797 --> 01:26:46,360
Oliver.

1484
01:26:46,684 --> 01:26:50,231
<i>- I'm Shelley.
- Nice to meet you again, Shelley.</i>

1485
01:26:51,037 --> 01:26:54,044
<i>Dear Hef, everything worked out!</i>

1486
01:26:54,045 --> 01:26:57,821
<i>We got 30 new Zeta sisters,
and the house was saved.</i>

1487
01:26:58,878 --> 01:27:01,309
<i>And Oliver and I started dating again.</i>

1488
01:27:01,310 --> 01:27:04,157
<i>Oliver is kind
and sweet and when we kiss...</i>

1489
01:27:04,158 --> 01:27:06,749
<i>I see stars and he sees fireworks.</i>

1490
01:27:06,750 --> 01:27:08,990
<i>And he says that means
that we're in love, and he's right!</i>

1491
01:27:08,991 --> 01:27:10,431
<i>Because otherwise, when we kiss</i>

1492
01:27:10,432 --> 01:27:13,343
<i>we'd see stuff like pencils
and empty ketchup bottles.</i>

1493
01:27:13,344 --> 01:27:16,734
<i>Oh, and the Zetas decided to throw
a big party in my honor...</i>

1494
01:27:16,735 --> 01:27:18,847
<i>and I felt just like that girl
from the storybook.</i>

1495
01:27:18,848 --> 01:27:20,671
<i>You know the one. What's her name?</i>

1496
01:27:20,672 --> 01:27:23,224
<i>Oh, yeah. Cinderella.</i>

1497
01:27:33,826 --> 01:27:36,032
<i>Where my Zetas at? Where my Zetas at?</i>

1498
01:27:36,033 --> 01:27:38,304
<i>Where my, where my...
Where my Zetas at?</i>

1499
01:27:38,305 --> 01:27:40,512
¶Hands up now... ¶

1500
01:27:40,513 --> 01:27:42,553
¶Push it up now¶

1501
01:27:43,234 --> 01:27:45,473
¶I know what boys like¶

1502
01:27:45,474 --> 01:27:47,649
¶Cute smiles and heels high¶

1503
01:27:47,650 --> 01:27:49,889
¶I tempt the hello¶

1504
01:27:49,890 --> 01:27:52,033
¶While I say bye-bye¶

1505
01:27:52,034 --> 01:27:54,274
¶I know they want me¶

1506
01:27:54,275 --> 01:27:56,481
¶They try to fake it¶

1507
01:27:56,482 --> 01:27:58,722
¶But they just end up¶

1508
01:27:58,723 --> 01:28:01,112
¶Intimidated!¶

1509
01:28:03,651 --> 01:28:05,923
¶It ain't that hard to see¶

1510
01:28:05,924 --> 01:28:07,810
¶I know you're feelin' me¶

1511
01:28:07,811 --> 01:28:09,539
¶I know what I want¶

1512
01:28:09,540 --> 01:28:11,779
¶If I think you'll give me¶

1513
01:28:11,780 --> 01:28:13,892
¶I might let you¶

1514
01:28:13,893 --> 01:28:16,227
¶Unconditionally, yeah¶

1515
01:28:16,228 --> 01:28:18,403
¶I might let you¶

1516
01:28:18,404 --> 01:28:20,579
¶If you're on my level¶

1517
01:28:20,580 --> 01:28:22,372
¶I might let you¶

1518
01:28:22,373 --> 01:28:25,028
¶And, baby, if I think you're special¶

1519
01:28:25,029 --> 01:28:27,013
¶I might let you!¶

1520
