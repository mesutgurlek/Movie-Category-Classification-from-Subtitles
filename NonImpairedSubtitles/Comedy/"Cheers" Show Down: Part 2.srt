1
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,188
So, Chuck,
how's the job search going?

2
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,470
l got something,
but l'm not too excited.

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,830
l'm a janitor in a biology lab

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,714
where they do DNA experiments,
making mutant viruses.

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,229
That sounds like a pretty good job.

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,715
Makes me nervous,
weird stuff floating around.

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,479
- Don't worry. l'm sure it's safe.
- Absolutely.

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,273
They take all the right precautions.

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,075
l guess you're right.
Must be getting a little paranoid.

10
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,436
l feel better already. See you later.

11
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,788
Take care, Chuck.

12
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,276
<i>Last week on Cheers...</i>

13
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,754
lnteresting.

14
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,668
That was Sam's brother.
He's on his way over.

15
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,074
He hates him.

16
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,112
The guy is better at everything
than l am. He's perfect.

17
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,190
- Nice voice. Who is that?
- Guess.

18
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,551
Your brother is one good-looking guy.

19
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,272
The guy did get me a job.

20
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,233
Hurry up. He's gonna do
some tap-dancing for us.

21
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,952
He's teaching me Spanish.

22
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,232
- You think Diane likes Derek?
- l'll pass her a note in gym.

23
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,319
He's just a man, like any other man
you'd meet in Greek mythology.

24
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,189
Derek just wants to fly me out
to Martha's Vineyard tonight.

25
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,596
ln a plane or on his back?

26
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,311
Whatever you and my brother Derek
wanna do is OK with me. l don't care.

27
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,796
- l'd rather stay with you.
- What? What did you say?

28
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,839
l didn't hear anything.

29
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,432
<i>ls Diane about to fall</i>
<i>for Sam's brother?</i>

30
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,869
<i>Will Sam's heart be broken?</i>

31
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,072
<i>Will Norm find happiness</i>
<i>in his new job?</i>

32
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,795
<i>Will Coach return</i>
<i>to coaching in Venezuela?</i>

33
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,879
<i>Will Carl Yastremski please call</i>
<i>Cheers and ask for the Spitfire?</i>

34
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,076
Well, Coach, it's just clear we've
reached a philosophical impasse.

35
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,237
Much like the question of the tree
falling in the woods.

36
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,078
The what?

37
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,920
The tree falling in the woods.

38
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:50,073
lf a tree falls in the woods
and there's nobody there to hear it,

39
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,634
does it make a sound?

40
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,911
lf there's nobody there,
how do you know it fell?

41
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,190
- We assume that it fell.
- But you don't know.

42
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:11,553
OK, l went into the woods yesterday
and saw the tree lying on the ground.

43
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,832
Beavers could have chewed on it
and gently lowered it to the ground.

44
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,718
You got me there on that one.
How about another beer?

45
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,799
l'm telling you, you surprise me.
You're not prepared at all tonight.

46
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,628
l fell asleep while going over my
notes preparing for our conversation.

47
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,716
You do that too?

48
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,870
Coach. Where's Diane today?

49
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,436
She must be out with Derek.
She's been out with him every day.

50
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,358
l'm sick of hearing about her.

51
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,917
Ever since Lady Dye-job arrived,
she gets all the attention.

52
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,955
Nobody cares about me. Nobody asks
what Carla's doing any more.

53
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,916
Come on, now. Be fair.

54
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,396
We weren't that interested
in your life before she got here.

55
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,269
Well, Sam, thanks again.

56
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,517
Thank you for dropping me off.
Sure you can't come in for a drink?

57
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,108
l'd love to,
but l'm in kind of a hurry.

58
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,199
l'm sorry l shrieked the wrong name.

59
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,276
That's OK.

60
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,715
- Hi, everyone.
- Hey, Sam.

61
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,832
Sammy. My, my, Sammy.

62
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,554
Tell me true,

63
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,468
not only did that gorgeous-looking
girl go out with you, she also drove?

64
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,353
She didn't drive, she carried me.

65
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,675
Sam, l'm proud of you.

66
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,793
You took my wimp speech to heart.
Great to see you back in action.

67
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,674
Thank you. lt took my mind off
my brother and your skinny co-worker.

68
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,155
l don't even care
where they are any more.

69
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,758
Where are they?

70
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:12,311
Bobby and Susie saw them at the
drive-in sharing a Coke and fries.

71
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,471
Afternoon, everybody.

72
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,432
- How you doing, Norm?
- Coach, l'm on top of the world.

73
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,313
Which is a dismal spot
in Greenland somewhere.

74
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,592
- How's your new job coming?
- Don't bring that up.

75
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,156
l am no longer in the employ
of Goldstein, Borman and Kawakami.

76
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,315
What happened?

77
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,954
l discovered
that so-called medical corporation

78
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,640
was a polite term
for a den of thieves.

79
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,194
They're in the business
of cheating on taxes.

80
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,834
So you resigned in protest.

81
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,633
Well, l took a long lunch
and they canned me.

82
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,510
- The last angry man.
- Damn right, l'm angry, Sammy.

83
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,234
Those are rich people
cheating on taxes.

84
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,999
And who has to foot the bill?
Honest folks.

85
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,917
Like me and you,

86
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:03,192
and all you nice people at the bar
that l've listed as my dependants.

87
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,032
So, where's Diane today?
She's not out with Derek again?

88
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,992
l don't believe it.

89
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,392
What happened to
all the interesting talk around here?

90
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,149
l used to enjoy coming in here
and listening to a good conversation.

91
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,717
Now there's so much gossip, you
should all have dryers on your heads.

92
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,555
- l'm gonna be in the office.
- OK, Sam.

93
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,229
- So what'll you have?
- l'll have a cup of tea.

94
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,590
And l'll have a small sherry.

95
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,109
Now, that sounds nice.

96
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,113
Sherry sounds very nice.
And it is late afternoon.

97
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,674
l think l'll have
a glass of sherry too, please.

98
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,918
- Two sherries.
- Make that a glass of wine.

99
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,237
- White wine.
- Wine.

100
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,273
l haven't had a glass of wine
in ages. ls your wine dry?

101
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,469
Yeah, it's OK.

102
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,670
- Give me some wine, too.
- Two wines.

103
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,634
You know what sounds like fun to me
all of a sudden?

104
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,796
- What?
- A beer.

105
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,230
l haven't had a beer
since l don't know when.

106
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,594
l used to have half a beer
on a hot day.

107
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,712
Well, it's quite cold out today.

108
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,991
Then put a shot of whisky with it
and it's perfect.

109
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,873
Two boilermakers.
Wild Turkey and Bud.

110
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,675
- l'll run a tab.
- Good.

111
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,516
What's wrong, Coach?

112
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:43,519
l didn't get the job in Venezuela.
They hired another guy.

113
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,632
- They didn't like your Spanish?
- The Spanish was fine.

114
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,399
They didn't like my English.

115
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,436
- That's too bad, Coach.
- Sorry.

116
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,755
Well, <i>que</i> so what, so what.

117
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,159
- Hello, everyone.
- Hi, Diane.

118
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,113
What are you doing here?
lt's your day off?

119
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,277
l needed to be in a place
where l had a few friends today.

120
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,356
So that's your next stop?

121
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,556
- Not today, Carla, please.
- What can l get you, honey?

122
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,398
l'll have a soda water.

123
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,989
- You never take a day off.
- Thursday's my day off.

124
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,033
- You work every Thursday.
- Yeah, but l go a little slower.

125
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,028
- So, tell me, how are you doing?
- Not very well.

126
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,709
- What is it?
- lt's Derek.

127
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,796
What about him?

128
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,069
He's flying to Paris today,
and he wants me to go with him.

129
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,236
He's a charming man, Coach.

130
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,476
He's everything
l've been looking for.

131
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,194
And l think
he's interested in me, too.

132
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,675
What a lousy break.

133
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,872
Wait a minute, Diane.
Maybe it's good.

134
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,991
- lt is good.
- l'll tell you why.

135
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,557
The second l looked at you and Derek,
l said, ''There goes a cute couple.''

136
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,274
Yeah.

137
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,958
What about Sam?

138
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,833
Sam and Derek
are a little cuter, yeah.

139
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,876
Coach, let me ask you a question.

140
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,676
You're asking a guy who's taken
a lot of fast balls in the head.

141
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,839
Are you sure
you want to ask the question?

142
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,794
- Do you think l'm a smart person?
- The smartest person l ever met.

143
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:37,869
Well, l, Diane Chambers, bred
and educated to walk with kings,

144
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,037
once offered a full scholarship
at the Sorbonne,

145
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,711
have become attracted to a
six-foot-three-inch bubble-gum card.

146
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,630
l think l can help you
with the sore buns, Diane, but...

147
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,430
..the rest of what you say
is all over my head.

148
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,279
Coach, l'm making a confession here.

149
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,755
Not just to you, but to myself.

150
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,074
Maybe l'll feel better
after l say this.

151
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,156
l...

152
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,197
l got it.

153
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,629
You're hot for Sam's chilli.

154
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:19,709
l think Keats would have said it
differently,... but l'll accept that.

155
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:24,436
Look, if you like Sam at all, l don't
understand what the problem is here.

156
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,630
Derek's making a commitment.

157
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,753
All l ever get from Sam
is adolescent flirtation.

158
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,030
l'm not sticking around for that.

159
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,958
lf he'd give me something,
anything, l'd stay.

160
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,478
Diane, you don't understand Sam.

161
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,388
Sam's the kind of a guy, you know,
he keeps his feelings to himself.

162
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:48,230
The more he cares about something,
the less he shows it.

163
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,590
l've been with him
through his divorce,

164
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,473
his boozing, the end of his career.

165
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,718
And let me tell you, the tougher
things got, the cooler he got.

166
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:02,356
lt's a damn sure bet that if
he's not expressing himself to you,

167
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,914
he's nuts about you.

168
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,996
Or he couldn't care less.

169
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,316
Do you mind if l say something?

170
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,829
Of course not, Norman.

171
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:19,511
Sometimes a man and a woman
are so afraid of rejection

172
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:23,428
that neither will take the first step
of admitting their true feelings.

173
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,793
Norman, that's beautiful.

174
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,275
l do have a romantic side, Diane.

175
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,351
l know l make a lot of jokes
about Vera, but...

176
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,349
the truth is if that woman
ever packed her bags and left me,

177
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,948
l don't know what l'd do... first.

178
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,959
Well, l guess l have no choice
but to force the issue. Where's Sam?

179
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,991
He's in the office, honey.

180
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,157
l'll tell him
l'm going away with his brother.

181
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:03,319
lf he's honest and doesn't hide
behind that tough jock façade,

182
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,759
l'll stay.

183
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,792
But if he does one of his
gratuitous jokes, l'm leaving.

184
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,198
- l swear it.
- Wait a minute, Diane. Hold on.

185
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,869
You're putting your whole future
on the line in this one moment.

186
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,151
You're letting your whole life
turn on this one response?

187
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,238
- You're right.
- Can it wait till l go to the head?

188
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,992
No.

189
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,076
l'll hear about it.

190
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,759
Coach, what did you do that for?

191
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,872
That was our chance
to get rid of her once and for all.

192
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,594
- Are you crazy?
- Crazy, Carla?

193
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,676
Crazy like a doorknob.

194
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,672
Hi, Diane.

195
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,236
Sam, your brother Derek has asked me
to go to Europe with him,

196
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,316
so l've come to say goodbye.

197
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,918
Dammit. l didn't need to hear that.

198
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,270
What's wrong?

199
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,995
lt's too late to put a help-want ad
in tomorrow's paper.

200
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,794
Goodbye, everyone.

201
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,469
l'm leaving now.
l'll miss you all very much.

202
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,556
Bye, Diane.

203
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,756
Bye-bye.

204
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,198
Sorry, honey,
l'm not interviewing till Monday.

205
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,880
Get this straight.
l'm going away with him.

206
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,592
Good. Have fun.

207
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,314
This could lead to marriage.
Probably will.

208
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,795
- Will lead to marriage.
- Great.

209
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,797
We'll be Diane and Derek Malone.

210
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,390
We'll buy a spread somewhere
and call it the Double-D.

211
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,272
lt'll make a nice brand.

212
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,551
Children. We'll have blonde,
blue-eyed children everywhere.

213
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,797
- Have them brush after every meal.
- l'll be your sister-in-law.

214
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:56,356
You'll come over for dinner
and say, ''She sets a good table.''

215
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,233
Had to say something.
You just fed me.

216
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,232
l'll send you Christmas cards.
''To a wonderful brother.''

217
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,476
Nice to be remembered
on the holidays.

218
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,593
The cards will have pictures of us.
Derek and l, the kids, the dogs.

219
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,075
The blonde ones will be the kids?

220
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,234
- This is alright with you?
- lf you're happy.

221
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,716
- l'm ecstatic. Goodbye.
- See you at the wedding.

222
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,594
- Do l get to kiss the bride?
- l think you know what you can kiss.

223
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,952
This is it, everyone.
l bid you a fond farewell.

224
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,913
l've enjoyed knowing you.
You've brought a lot to my life.

225
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,951
Bye.

226
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,878
- Goodbye, everyone.
- Bye.

227
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,349
- Farewell.
- Get the hell outta here. Go.

228
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,996
l won't let it end this way.

229
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,315
l've had warts
that went away quicker.

230
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,229
- What did l hit?
- My nose. You're supposed to knock.

231
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:18,116
You were coming out to say
something to me. What is it?

232
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,437
- l wasn't gonna say anything.
- Yes, you were. What was it?

233
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,232
- Go to the airport.
- Say it.

234
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,316
No.

235
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,753
What are you doing with that?

236
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:43,077
- Tell me what you were gonna say.
- Don't do that. l hate that.

237
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,870
l hate that. Please stop.
Would you just stop? Put that down.

238
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,431
- Please don't go.
- Ask me nice.

239
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,519
- Come on.
- l deserve that much. Ask me nice.

240
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,837
Just put it down.
Put the blackboard down.

241
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,356
Put it down.

242
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,033
Please stay.

243
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,155
- Why should l?
- Go on, get out.

244
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,435
l'm not sticking around in the hope
something will happen between us.

245
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:24,473
- What is it you want from me?
- For you to tell me what you want.

246
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,513
l'll tell you exactly what l want.
l want to know what you want.

247
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,431
You're doing it again.

248
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:35,553
Listen, will you just explain
one thing to me?

249
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,035
lt is very important to me.

250
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,154
- Why aren't you with Derek?
- Because l like you better.

251
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:50,552
Diane, listen. All the jealousy
l felt for my brother over the years

252
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:54,673
is nothing to what l felt
these last five minutes.

253
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,717
We're about ready to start
something that might be great.

254
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,796
Yeah.

255
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,437
Maybe we should kiss or something.

256
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,516
We're not gonna just kiss.

257
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,594
We're about to start something.
A kiss is where you start, isn't it?

258
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,792
You don't make an announcement
when you kiss someone.

259
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,515
lt wasn't an announcement.
l didn't want to catch you off guard.

260
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,838
On our first kiss, it's OK to be
off guard. You should be swept away.

261
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,235
l was.

262
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:38,717
Nobody's swept away when they say,
''Maybe we should kiss.''

263
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,036
You're right.

264
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,839
When l do it, l won't say anything.

265
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,915
No. This isn't right, either.

266
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,591
l didn't say anything.
l was swept away.

267
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,188
The moment's not right.
We're too aware of what we're doing.

268
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,233
You're right. This whole thing
is not going the way it should.

269
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,955
Maybe we should just forget
about the kiss and hit the sack.

270
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,637
This is the dumbest conversation
we have ever had,

271
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,992
which means it's the dumbest
conversation that's ever been.

272
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,112
Maybe this whole thing
is just a mistake.

273
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,629
- What thing?
- This thing we're trying to do.

274
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,228
Every time we try to get together,
it goes wrong.

275
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,955
Just cos l'm a neat-looking guy
and you're kinda hungry...

276
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,559
Hungry?

277
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:38,674
No, listen. What l mean by that
is you've been here a long time.

278
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,360
lf it was gonna happen,
it would have happened by now.

279
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,835
lt's silly of us
to try to make it happen.

280
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:48,636
Fine. You tell me this
now that l've let Derek go.

281
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,593
Don't throw Derek in my face.
You never cared for Derek.

282
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,598
- You just used him to trap me.
- Trap you?

283
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,395
l'm the best thing to happen to you
and you're too stupid to realise it.

284
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:03,389
You're the worst thing that happened
to me. Before you came, l was happy.

285
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,034
You believe
you were happier before you met me?

286
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,118
Hell, yes. How do you think it feels

287
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,959
to be attracted to someone
that makes you sick?

288
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,554
l could write a book on the subject.

289
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:25,719
You can't shut up long enough
to write a cheque.

290
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,070
You are trying to change the subject.

291
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,476
The subject is, you can't
shut up long enough to kiss me.

292
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,559
To save your life, l bet you
couldn't shut up for 30 seconds.

293
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,671
- Make it ten.
- l most certainly could.

294
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,917
- Alright, let's see.
- You're going to time me?

295
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,430
That's right. l'm gonna time you.
Ten seconds starting now.

296
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,199
- This is the most...
- You want to try again?

297
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,829
l wasn't really trying. You want to
see me do this? Fine. Starting now.

298
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,034
- This is the craziest thing...
- Really good.

299
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,789
So l can't do it.
Silence is overrated anyway.

300
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,915
- At least l have something to say.
- l don't?

301
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,270
The last conversation
l had with Derek

302
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:11,678
was about walking on the moors
like Heathcliff and Catherine,

303
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,756
and l threw it all away for this.

304
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,156
l'll tell you what you do.
Why don't you...

305
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,196
Get out of here. Go on.

306
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,556
Take her with you. Go on. Get out.

307
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:34,110
- Don't push me.
- Why don't you just go find Derek?

308
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,559
Fine.

309
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,558
Shouldn't be hard to find him.
Just follow the applause.

310
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,035
- Maybe l can still catch him.
- Fine.

311
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,628
While you're floating around,
remember this:

312
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,479
you are the nuttiest, the stupidest,

313
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,670
the phoniest fruitcake l ever met.

314
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,995
You are the most arrogant,
self-centred...

315
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,157
- Shut up. Shut your fat mouth.
- Make me.

316
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:59,354
Make you? My God, l'm gonna bounce
you off every wall in this office.

317
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,358
Try it, and you'll be
walking funny tomorrow.

318
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,596
Or should l say funnier?

319
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:12,352
l always wanted to pop you one.
Maybe this is my lucky day.

320
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,836
- You disgust me. l hate you.
- Are you as turned on as l am?

321
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,916
- More.
- Bet me.

322
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:26,669
- <i>l'm gonna nibble on your ear.</i>
- <i>Don't tell me.</i>

323
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,835
