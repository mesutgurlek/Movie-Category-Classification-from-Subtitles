1
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,265
Come on, colonel.

2
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:29,810
- Get that jeep out of here.
Right, Kelly.

3
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:34,773
We've been here for two hours.

4
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:38,694
No, that's map section 3, not 4.

5
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:42,072
I don't give a damn what Command says
about anything.

6
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,868
Look, Mulligan, I don't think
I'm getting through to you.

7
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:49,288
You' re dropping your damn barrage
on our position.

8
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:50,872
Sit and see.

9
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,834
You can't hear me?
The reason you can't hear me...

10
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,712
...is because you're firing your mortar
at your end...

11
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,506
...and they're dropping here at our end.

12
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:03,427
No, the Krauts are not here. We're here.

13
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:07,055
Mulligan, your bombs are coming down
on our heads.

14
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:09,016
I don't know where the Krauts are.

15
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:13,312
Just lift your goddamn barrage. Over.

16
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:20,819
I told you to bring me some good-looking
kid, not this fat, sausage-chewing wino.

17
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:25,907
Well, if you were looking for a young boy,
you should've sent somebody else, Joe.

18
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,416
Mulligan, you son of a bitch.

19
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:37,377
Hey, Joe, it looks like they're trying
to push up the canal.

20
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:40,005
What do you want me to do
about it, Petuko?

21
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,923
The half-track's been wiped out.

22
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:44,259
- Eddie's been hit.
- Okay.

23
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:48,638
Go see what's happening. Grace, Jonesey,
grab a litter and go with Corporal Job.

24
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:50,932
On the double.

25
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:52,768
Mickey Mouse.

26
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:55,812
- It's Mulligan.
- It's Mulligan. What the hell does he want?

27
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,356
He says he's sorry.

28
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:00,275
Sorry. Son of a bitch.

29
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:01,443
Mulligan.

30
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:05,280
Big Joe's a little upset right now.
I think maybe you should leave town.

31
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,532
Get out of the neighborhood.

32
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,950
Right.

33
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,911
Does he speak English?

34
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,997
Yeah, he's a colonel in Intelligence.

35
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:15,916
Here.

36
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:20,295
As a big noise with the German Intelligence
you ought to be able to tell us about Nancy.

37
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,547
- Under the Geneva Convention you only...
- Sit down.

38
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,802
I'm not interested in defenses,
I'm interested in hotels. Okay?

39
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:30,097
Are there any still standing?

40
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:32,974
There are three.
Two are defended by units of...

41
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:35,310
And which is the most comfortable?

42
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,020
- I don't know.
Hey, look.

43
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:40,357
Think of us as tourists.
I don't want any military information.

44
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,275
I just want to know the best hotel.

45
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:46,530
- I think it is called the Majestic.
- And who's the owner?

46
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,741
I can't remember his name.

47
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:53,161
All right, all right.
Checkthe Michelin Guide.

48
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:54,538
Now, what about women?

49
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:59,167
I must warn you. The German Army
is preparing a counter attack...

50
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:00,335
Sit down.

51
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:03,672
Look, we're not worried
about the German Army.

52
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,008
We got enough troubles of our own.
To the right, General Patton.

53
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:10,762
To the left, the British Army.
To the rear, our own goddamn artillery.

54
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,349
And besides all that, it's raining.
The good thing about the weather...

55
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,977
...it keeps our Air Corps
from blowing us to hell...

56
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,520
...because it's too lousy to fly.

57
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:23,066
Okay.

58
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:27,112
Now, what about the broads in Nancy?

59
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,198
- Broads?
- The women.

60
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:34,828
Yes, there is a house.
I cannot give you the directions.

61
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,037
I've never been there.

62
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:39,416
Hey, here it is. "Nancy.

63
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:40,709
Principal attractions:

64
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:44,629
The Church of the Cordeliers tombs.
Woodwork and statues.

65
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:49,009
City Hall, 18th century,
with stairway and square reception room.

66
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,553
Palace Stanislas' impressive gates.

67
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:54,556
Porterie, Museum of Lorraine.
Charge to see... "

68
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:58,685
Will you cut the culture crap
and get to the hotels?

69
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,688
Majestic Hotel, three stars,
a knife and a fork.

70
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,523
Beautiful.

71
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:07,360
We keep this guy until we get to Nancy.
We can use him when we get to town.

72
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,404
- Hey, Joe.
What do you want, Barbara?

73
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,114
The captain wants to see you.

74
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,282
"The captain. "

75
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,450
I'll be right with you.

76
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,368
- What should I do?
- Stay on the radio.

77
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:18,330
Joe, I think we ought to send him back
for interrogation.

78
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,041
Look, nobody's copping out on this.
Do you understand?

79
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,960
The colonel serves a more strategic
purpose staying with us.

80
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:26,463
He needs interrogating,
then you do it right here.

81
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,298
Open the door.

82
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:35,138
- Hey, Joe. Do me a favor, will you?
- What do you want?

83
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,806
- What?
- Don't call me Barbara.

84
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:39,768
- That's your name, isn't it?
- But my name's Babra.

85
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,938
- Come on, will you?
- I only wanted to...

86
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,706
What are these, colonel?

87
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:05,335
Just my orders and letters of transport.

88
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,087
Fisher?

89
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:10,674
- What are you transporting?
- Files.

90
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,092
What kind of files?

91
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:16,263
- Clerical.
- Clerical, huh?

92
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,182
Mind telling me
what you were doing in this area?

93
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,185
I needed petrol for my trucks.
The bombing.

94
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:23,979
Trucks won't move without petrol.

95
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:31,987
- What do you want, Kelly?
- Interpret these for me, will you?

96
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,409
What are these?

97
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,452
Lead bars.
- Lead?

98
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,999
Yes, the bag was supposed
to have been dropped in the water...

99
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,667
...in case of capture.

100
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,003
Unfortunately, you surprised me.

101
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:52,465
All these papers are about some kind
of convoy from France to Germany.

102
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:54,801
Code name is Tannenbaum.

103
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:58,972
- Travel reports are a shipment of...
- That's enough.

104
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,182
Thanks.

105
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,228
Colonel.

106
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,523
Come here, colonel.

107
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:11,192
Oh, Little Joe, give me that brandy,
will you?

108
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,070
What for?
- Just give me the brandy.

109
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:18,283
Kelly, what do you want to give away
the good brandy to the Kraut for?

110
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:21,036
This way, colonel.

111
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,371
Over here.

112
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,249
Sit down on this bench.

113
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,591
I want you to have a drink.

114
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:38,303
- Under the Geneva Convention...
- This isn't Geneva, colonel.

115
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:42,057
I just want to have a nice sociable talk
with you, that's all.

116
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,561
Go ahead. Drink.

117
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,230
But I will not divulge
any further information.

118
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,816
Drink.

119
00:10:57,531 --> 00:11:00,075
You idiot. Hold it.

120
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:03,370
Come on, cover me.

121
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,956
Mitchell.

122
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:15,840
- Mitchell?
Yeah?

123
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,092
Big Joe.

124
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,428
All right, you stay here.

125
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:25,225
- All right, where is he?
- Inside.

126
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:31,564
Captain?
Yeah, who is it?

127
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,983
It's me, Big Joe. Where are you?

128
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,944
I'm in here.

129
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,614
- What are you doing there, sir?
- I'm checking out the motor.

130
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,741
The motor? What for?

131
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:45,495
We' re pulling out. I want to see if
this boat's worth taking back to the base.

132
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,038
What about Nancy?

133
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:50,125
Third Army's taking over.
We go into reserve.

134
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,001
When they take Nancy,
we go back in the line.

135
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:55,755
Oh, wow. I don't think you have the welfare
of your men at heart.

136
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:59,968
Now, look, this is a big town,
with a lot of passionate broads...

137
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:03,221
...great restaurants, feather beds
in rooms with hot water.

138
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:07,600
Look, captain, we've been rained on,
pushed on, bombed on...

139
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:11,771
...mortared on by Mulligan all the way
from the Normandy Beachhead.

140
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:13,732
I'm aware of that problem, sergeant.

141
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:18,486
You've been aware of that problem ever
since we got out of the water at Omaha.

142
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:21,990
Look, why is it that every time
we get to a town like Nancy...

143
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,659
...these guys with the clean uniforms
and the ties...

144
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:27,620
...get to ride in the trucks into town
and make their pitch?

145
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:30,290
The general says we pull out,
so we pull out.

146
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:34,002
Look, captain.
You can't let them do this.

147
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,797
I gotta get my men near broads before
they start freaking out with each other.

148
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,675
I'm aware that
that situation might be developing.

149
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,178
Think I could get this
in the hold of a B-17?

150
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:45,555
We' re point section
to the whole damn Army.

151
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,016
- Nancy's our town, captain. Yeah.
Hey, Joe.

152
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,351
There's a company of Germans
starting to push.

153
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,021
Relax, I'll be with you in a minute.
Captain.

154
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,356
We got it all figured out.
We even got a guide.

155
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:57,150
All we have to do is get in there.

156
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:00,028
Well, there's a couple of German
divisions say you can't.

157
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,362
So we need a little help.

158
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,907
The help I need is
to get this yacht out of here.

159
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:06,159
Get back to the barn. I'll do it myself.

160
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:09,662
Hey, look, captain, you're supposed to be
in charge of this outfit.

161
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,624
You' re doing such a good job.
Why should I get in your way?

162
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,959
Oh, God.

163
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,046
Hey, Cowboy.

164
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:23,218
Got a report that three tanks are coming
up the road. I suggest you get activated.

165
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:29,057
Hold her down there a bit, Willard.
The corporal's trying to tell us something.

166
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,226
Yes, sir. You're telling me what?

167
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:35,396
There are three tanks coming up the road.
I suggest you get activated.

168
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:38,775
Oh, now, come on, pal.
Ain't you got any Shermans?

169
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,152
We've been polishing these things
for two days.

170
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,447
If we take them out there in that rain,
they' re gonna rust up on us.

171
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:48,076
Come on, don't give me a hard time.
Get off your ass, and get out there.

172
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,537
Yes, sir. I didn't mean nothing.

173
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:54,457
I was just trying to tell you how we're
feeling, ain't that right, Willard? Yee-haw!

174
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:58,586
Hold the ground at all costs.
We' re a reconnaissance company.

175
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:01,631
It's not our job to hold the ground.
That's an Infantry job.

176
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,925
We' re supposed to go out
and find someplace...

177
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,386
...look at it and tell you
what the situation is.

178
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:11,015
I can tell you what the situation is.
It stinks.

179
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:14,310
It's wet, it's cold,
and we're under heavy fire.

180
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,272
Yes. Yes.

181
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:20,275
Are they sending up anything
to support us?

182
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:22,735
They say they haven't got anything.
We've been ordered to hold.

183
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:27,240
Hold. With what?
- That's what I told them.

184
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,076
You think we ought to pull out?

185
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:32,620
You think we ought to pull out?

186
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,957
I don't know. Better wait for Big Joe.

187
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,793
Corporal, those aren't Mulligan's mortars
coming anymore.

188
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,879
Those are German 88s.

189
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:45,466
Much as I like Big Joe, I don't want to
spend the rest of the war in a prison camp.

190
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:49,470
Besides which, I'm first-generation Italian,
they'd shoot me as a traitor.

191
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:53,057
The indications are the Germans
are coming and we're not gonna stop them.

192
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:58,146
With your permission I'm gonna pull the
vehicle to the other side of the canal.

193
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:01,482
Yeah, go on.

194
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,985
Penn, Fisher. Get that damn thing
out of here.

195
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,613
Okay, everybody.
We' re pulling out on the double.

196
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:10,158
Move that stretcher.

197
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,662
Goddamn it, Cowboy.

198
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:19,125
I don't know what you was talking about.
There ain't three tanks. There's about 20.

199
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,169
- Ain't that right, Willard?
Damn right.

200
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:24,047
Get that thing to the other side
of the canal, you maniac.

201
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:27,175
Well, that's what we was
figuring on doing. Ha-ha-ha.

202
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:36,059
Kelly, come on, we' re going.
You' re coming, ain't you?

203
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:38,937
- Go on ahead.
- All right, all right, good luck.

204
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,522
Okay, Penn, let's go.

205
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,988
Colonel.

206
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:43,918
How many more bars of gold like this
do you have in that convoy?

207
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:48,297
No, no, come on, speak English,
colonel, come on.

208
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:51,759
How many bars like this in your trucks?

209
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,929
- Fourteen.
- Fourteen what?

210
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,305
Thousand.

211
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:00,601
Fourteen thousand?

212
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:05,106
Whoo.

213
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:10,236
Colonel, whereabouts
is your convoy right now?

214
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:13,322
Where are your trucks?

215
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:16,617
- Clermont.
- In Clermont. Clermont?

216
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:19,370
Is the gold still in the trucks?

217
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,710
Whereabouts? Whereabouts is the gold?

218
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,588
In the bank. It is a bank.

219
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:35,595
Colonel. Wake up, wake up.
What about support units?

220
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:38,639
- Support units?
- Yeah, tanks.

221
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:42,060
Come on, tanks. Stuff like that.

222
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,687
Tanks.

223
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,273
Three Tiger tanks.

224
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,317
What about infantry?

225
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:53,446
What about infantry, colonel?

226
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:09,295
- Did you hear from headquarters?
- We've been ordered to hold.

227
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:12,673
I'll tell them when to hold.
The Third took over one hour ago.

228
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,509
- We're pulling out of here.
- Great.

229
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:17,178
- Where's Maitland?
- He's salvaging a yacht.

230
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,846
A yacht?
- A yacht.

231
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:21,849
- I'll see you about 10 miles down the road.
Wait a minute.

232
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:25,812
- Is everybody across the bridge?
- Kelly's in the barn with that colonel.

233
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:28,856
- Did you tell him we're pulling out?
- We told him. He's crazy.

234
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:33,569
Tell Mulligan to give me three minutes
and then lay all the mortar into that barn.

235
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,363
- Understand?
- If you say so.

236
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,198
You wait here.

237
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:38,866
Mulligan.

238
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:43,371
Come on, colonel. Come on.

239
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:46,791
Get up and sit right here.

240
00:18:57,386 --> 00:19:00,388
Kelly. Half the German Army's
coming up the road.

241
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:03,891
In a few minutes, Mulligan's gonna drop
10 tons of mortar on this joint.

242
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:06,727
- What the hell are you doing?
- Looking after the colonel.

243
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,980
Shoot him and let's get the hell
out of here.

244
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,858
- Shoot him, we don't get the gold.
- What gold?

245
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:14,819
The gold that's in a bank
25 miles east of Nancy, that's what.

246
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:20,825
Mulligan, I said three minutes.
Come on, let's get out of here.

247
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,185
Kelly? You okay, Kelly?

248
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,270
Yeah, I'm all right.

249
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:55,443
Come on, you nut.
Let's get the hell out of here.

250
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:08,998
Fisher. Petuko. Come on,
we're moving out. Moving out.

251
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:13,211
Moving out. Babra. Come on. Move it.

252
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,004
Get in, we' re pulling out.

253
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:41,197
Kelly, you nut. Come on.

254
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,697
Wait a minute, will you?
Will you wait a minute?

255
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:25,825
Listen to me a second.
It's not me, I tell you. It's not me.

256
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:30,371
I can't tell one shell from another. They
all look alike. They all look alike, Kelly.

257
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,999
If it was me,
if I could tell, would I be here?

258
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,751
Would I be here?
I wouldn't be here, Kelly.

259
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,714
I'd be in the States checking out the duds.
I'd be out with all those broads.

260
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:41,757
- I'd be working in a factory.
- Relax.

261
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:45,386
Wait a minute. We've got to have
a little understanding around here.

262
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:48,681
How the hell do we ever get
any understanding around here, Kelly?

263
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:50,057
- Relax.
- You got...

264
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:54,228
Mulligan, I just want to
make a proposition to you.

265
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:59,025
A proposition?

266
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,366
Well, is it dirty, or just illegal?

267
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:13,080
Well, I want you
to set up a barrage for me.

268
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:16,709
I want you to lay down
a barrage for me, Mulligan.

269
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:20,087
Grid section 7,
right here at these crossroads.

270
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:23,466
Yeah, well, I gotta have a signed
operations order from the C.O.

271
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:25,426
I need an authorization.

272
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:29,597
You see, that's just the problem, Mulligan.
We don't have an authorization.

273
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,265
You don't have a...

274
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:34,560
Well, Kelly, without an authorization,
I can't help you.

275
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:39,899
I told you I had a proposition, Mulligan.
That's just what I meant.

276
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:41,942
A proposition.

277
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:55,414
Yeah. Well, uh...

278
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:57,291
Why?

279
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,627
Why what?

280
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,253
Why...?

281
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:04,757
Why, uh... Why not? Heh.

282
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,469
You won't forget me now, will you?

283
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,513
Why, no. I won't forget, Kelly.

284
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,099
You' re a good man, Mulligan.

285
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:15,976
Yeah, Kelly.

286
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:33,160
Come on. Come on.
Screw you, Mac.

287
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:34,453
Come on, move it.

288
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,205
Up yours, baby.

289
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,290
Hey, hey, come on, get it out of there.

290
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:39,583
Come on.

291
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:42,461
Hey, come on. Come on,
come on, move it.

292
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:45,923
Come on. All right, come on, you guys.
Clear it out.

293
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:49,969
Come on, get the horse out of here.
Get on the side, will you? Come on.

294
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:53,013
Move it out, come on now.
Move it, move it.

295
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:56,308
Keep it going, boys. Move it through.

296
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:58,644
All right, keep it going. Let's go.
Come on.

297
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,521
A message from Captain Maitland.

298
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:01,981
- Did you read it?
- Yeah.

299
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:04,942
- What's it say?
- He wanted you to read it, Joe.

300
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:08,362
Take the underwear off your head, huh?
Enough is enough.

301
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,075
We've been ordered to pull back.

302
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,202
We've been ordered to pull back.

303
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,829
Yeah, I heard.

304
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,330
All right.

305
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:22,543
We've been ordered back
to map reference 473, so let's move it.

306
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,712
But my hair is still in curlers.

307
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,255
That's telling them, Willard.

308
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:28,591
Come on, let's move it out.

309
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:31,093
Hey, Joe, what about Nancy?

310
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:34,054
Pack it up, let's go.

311
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:37,349
Move them out, will you, corporal?

312
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,524
Where have you been?

313
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:47,735
- Checking a few things out.
- Like what?

314
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:50,362
I'm going after that gold, Joe.

315
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,448
That's what I thought.

316
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:53,699
Do you want in?

317
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:55,618
Do I want in?

318
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,954
Let me tell you something.
Let me make it nice and clear.

319
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:02,750
I got a job to do and that's to get you guys
to Berlin without getting killed.

320
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:05,377
We've been at the front end
of this war all the way.

321
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:08,088
If you whisper one word
about the gold to these guys...

322
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:12,176
...I'm gonna have you bounced so fast
your feet won't touch the ground.

323
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:16,180
- Now, do you understand that, Kelly?
- Yeah. Yeah, I understand.

324
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:19,975
You'd better fix up some transfer papers
for me, because I'm going.

325
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:21,810
With you or without you.

326
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:23,771
Okay.

327
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:38,786
Give me a hand down there.
What a bunch of shit this is.

328
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:56,637
Okay, sergeant, everything's secure
up here. I'm coming down now.

329
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,274
Hi, captain.

330
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:11,527
Sergeant, do you think I can get this yacht
to Paris by Sunday?

331
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:14,863
You didn't bring me to this farmhouse
to talk about this boat again?

332
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:18,742
I worked a deal with headquarters. I've
got three days' rest for you and the men.

333
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,828
Make sure they have a good time.

334
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:23,998
I gotta get this yacht to Paris
and pick up things for the general.

335
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:27,835
- And where do we spend this vacation?
- Right here, sergeant.

336
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:32,673
Are you kidding?

337
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:36,176
I'm not kidding. With a little imagination,
you can fix this place up.

338
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:39,179
Lay out a baseball diamond.
Run the water into the house.

339
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:42,308
Special service is coming by
with some magazines and paperbacks.

340
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:46,020
We' re 10 miles from the nearest town.
There's no action.

341
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:49,023
That's the beautiful thing
about this location. It's quiet.

342
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:52,735
Get yourselves a suntan, a little rest.
In three days we're back in the line.

343
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:54,320
Hey, captain.

344
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:57,156
- We're all ready to move out.
- Yeah, I'm coming. Go ahead.

345
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:59,908
There's no booze, there's no broads,
there's no action.

346
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:03,621
Another thing. Don't fool around
with the women, their husbands carry guns.

347
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,206
And don't forget, the penalty
for looting is death.

348
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,376
Loot what? There's nothing here to loot.

349
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,296
I'll be back in three days.

350
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:25,351
"Get yourself a suntan
and get some rest. "

351
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:27,269
He's gotta be out of his mind.

352
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:30,856
But how does he get away with it?
That's what I'd like to know.

353
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:34,652
Very simple.
The general's his uncle, that's how.

354
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:15,734
There's a girl with a heart
As big as...

355
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:18,278
- Crapgame?
What do you want?

356
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:22,241
I want to talk to you
for a couple minutes.

357
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,201
What about?

358
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:28,914
I have this deal I've been working on.

359
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:32,668
I thought you might be interested
in helping me out.

360
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,754
What kind of deal?

361
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:37,256
A private deal.

362
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:40,634
Oh, yeah?
Hey, Harry, go get yourself a haircut.

363
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:45,639
I hear Maitland's got himself a yacht
and taking it to Paris.

364
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:46,974
That's right.

365
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:49,601
No money in yachts.
What does he want a yacht for?

366
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:53,480
Who cares, as long as it keeps him
out of our hair for a few days?

367
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,941
Okay, Kelly.

368
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,818
What is it? What is it you want?

369
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:03,907
Well, I want 15 Thompsons,
two. 30 caliber machine guns...

370
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,160
...two bazookas, two field radios...

371
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:10,956
...and supplies and ammunition to last a
platoon of men in the field for three days.

372
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:13,876
- Oh. That all?
- Nope.

373
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,296
I want the Intelligence report
for this whole sector...

374
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:19,840
...and I need them in the next two hours.

375
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:22,676
That's nice. What's in it for me?

376
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:25,679
- A piece of the action.
- What kind of action?

377
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,057
This kind of action.

378
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:49,328
Hello, Izzy? Yeah, it's me, it's me.

379
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:53,832
Listen, get me a quotation for gold
on the Paris market.

380
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,627
Yeah, now, and hurry it up.

381
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:03,926
How much more where this came from?

382
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:07,638
Fourteen thousand bars.

383
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:12,684
Fourteen thousand bars? Ha, ha.

384
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:14,728
Fourteen thousand.

385
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:18,148
Hey, sweetheart, have yourself a bottle
of booze, you're beautiful.

386
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:20,943
Fourteen thousand bars.
Zadda-bow-bow.

387
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:24,154
That's beautiful. Where is it?

388
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,906
In a bank.

389
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:27,825
In a bank?

390
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:31,119
You' re getting pretty ambitious,
aren't you?

391
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:34,206
I mean, to think you can blow a bank
and get away with it?

392
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:35,582
It's behind enemy lines.

393
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:39,253
Behind enemy lines.

394
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:45,342
Yeah. That could be the perfect crime.

395
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:52,266
Hello? Yeah. Yeah, Izzy.

396
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:55,227
Right. Right, I got you.

397
00:30:55,395 --> 00:31:00,816
Let's see. Seven carry the two, gold, 54.

398
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:06,697
Hm. $1.6 million.

399
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:08,949
What else will you need?

400
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,909
You could probably use some armor.

401
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:13,495
What are you doing up there?

402
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:16,081
- Hey, Crapgame.
- Who the hell's that?

403
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:18,292
His name's Oddball.

404
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,044
I got three Shermans outside.

405
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:24,131
Yeah? What outfit?

406
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:27,801
Right now I don't have any outfit.

407
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:32,180
Who's your commanding officer?

408
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:35,642
He got decapitated by an 88
about six weeks ago.

409
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,144
But don't say you're sorry.

410
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:40,647
He's been trying to get us killed
ever since we landed at Omaha Beach.

411
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:42,149
It's terrible.

412
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:45,777
He hasn't reported him dead yet.
You see, I've been collecting his whiskey.

413
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:48,989
We see our role
as essentially defensive in nature.

414
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:51,450
While our armies are advancing so fast...

415
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:54,328
...and everyone's knocking themselves out
to be heroes...

416
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:56,705
...we are holding ourselves in reserve...

417
00:31:56,873 --> 00:32:00,459
...in case the Krauts mount a
counteroffensive which threatens Paris...

418
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:03,253
...or maybe even New York.

419
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:06,298
Then we can move in and stop them.

420
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:10,093
But for $1.6 million...

421
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:13,847
...we could become heroes
for three days.

422
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:20,354
A Sherman can give you
a very nice edge.

423
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:24,608
Where are these Shermans?

424
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,526
They' re outside.

425
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:30,030
Come on, I'll show them to you.

426
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:02,104
These are my boys.

427
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:38,432
And these are your tanks, huh?

428
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:41,268
- Yep.
- Yeah.

429
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:45,689
I mean, don't let the dirt and the rust
hang you up.

430
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,650
We like to give the impression
that we're just out of action.

431
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:52,779
Badly in need of a period
of rest and reorganization.

432
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:55,282
That way nobody bugs us.

433
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:01,997
Come on, look at the engine.

434
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:11,506
This engine's been modified
by our mechanical genius here, Moriarty.

435
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:12,841
Right?

436
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,926
Whatever you say, babe.

437
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:21,516
These tanks are faster than any other tanks
in the European theater of operations.

438
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:23,477
Forwards or backwards.

439
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:28,315
See, man, we like to feel that we can get out
of trouble quicker than we got into it.

440
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:33,487
Any other secret weapons?

441
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:37,240
Yeah. I mean, like, you see,
all the tanks we come up against...

442
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,117
...are bigger and better than ours.

443
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:42,037
So that all we can hope to do
is, like, scare them away.

444
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:44,289
This gun is an ordinary 76 millimeter...

445
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:47,793
...but we added this piece of pipe onto it
and the Krauts think, like, uh...

446
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,795
...maybe it's a 90 millimeter.

447
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:51,505
We got our own ammunition.

448
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:56,301
It's filled with paint.
When we fire it, it makes pretty pictures.

449
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,220
It scares the hell out of people.

450
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:05,936
We got a loudspeaker here and when we go
into battle, we play music very loud.

451
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:07,854
It kind of...

452
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:10,190
...calms us down.

453
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:20,784
Come on inside for a minute.

454
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,668
If I hear any more threats
against Maitland's life.

455
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:33,713
If I hear any more wild talk about going
to headquarters and killing the general.

456
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:35,841
Or raping nurses at the field hospital.

457
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:38,385
I'm gonna strangle the guy
with my bare hands.

458
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:41,304
Now, all good things
come to those who wait.

459
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:44,474
We' re gonna have a lot of fun here.
Aren't we, Cowboy?

460
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:47,477
- You can bet your boots on that, partner.
- Sergeant, partner.

461
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:48,854
- Right, Sarge.
- All right.

462
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:50,063
Joe?
- Yeah.

463
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:52,399
I think I've got the crabs.

464
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:56,444
We' re gonna boil our laundry.
We' re gonna set up a little shower area...

465
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:59,072
...so we can wash our little bodies.
Right, Barbara?

466
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,991
- Babra.
Shut up.

467
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,200
Shave.

468
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:05,370
A little wine, women and song.
A little chiquita for you, Petuko.

469
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:07,414
It's gonna take time to get organized...

470
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:10,667
...but I want that farmhouse
to look like a nightclub. Little Joe.

471
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,377
I want you to set up a bar.

472
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:14,004
We ain't got no booze.

473
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,672
"We ain't got no booze. "

474
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,382
Well, we' re going to get some booze.

475
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,676
I'm gonna go down to Battalion...

476
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:23,930
...see if I can lay my hands on some
dirty movies and when I come back...

477
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:27,726
...I want that farmhouse not only clean,
but completely decorated.

478
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,269
Do you understand that?

479
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:32,189
All right, corporal, fall them out.
Let's get moving.

480
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:42,490
$16 million.

481
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:44,743
Kelly, I think I made a slight mistake.

482
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:48,330
It's not 1.6 million, it's $16 million.

483
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:50,165
- What a bundle.
Yeah, all right.

484
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,751
We' re gonna need plenty of gasoline
on this trip.

485
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:55,128
You can handle getting it through
enemy lines?

486
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:59,132
- Just name the place, baby.
Okay.

487
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:02,010
Right here. Grid section B.

488
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:03,637
Tonight at 2100 hours.

489
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:06,848
No good, man. The boys have got
something special on tonight.

490
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:10,101
Are you nuts?
What's more important than $16 million?

491
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:13,813
You come around tonight, Crapgame,
and we'll show you.

492
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:15,941
Okay.

493
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:18,693
Tomorrow night, then.
Along this road, same hour.

494
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:20,904
We'll be there.

495
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:25,325
- If you' re late, we move out without you.
- If we're late, it's because we' re dead.

496
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:26,576
What about Big Joe?

497
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:29,162
You handle the supplies,
I'll take care of Big Joe.

498
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:32,290
I'm going along to protect my investment.

499
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:33,458
You don't trust me.

500
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:36,503
A firm financial mind should be behind
an enterprise such as this.

501
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:40,257
There could be a bonus. Besides,
Switzerland's only 100 miles away.

502
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,842
I don't want anybody getting lost.

503
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:46,680
Now, look, I don't want
half the Army in on this deal.

504
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:50,850
Don't want any friends or friends of friends.
I want to keep it a tight little unit.

505
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:53,186
Right, Oddball?

506
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,814
Oh, yeah, man. I mean, like...

507
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:58,108
No sweat, you know?

508
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,821
I'll pick you up in about an hour.

509
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:06,074
You can hang onto that bar of gold
as a deposit.

510
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:11,705
Who is that guy, Crapgame?

511
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:14,207
Oh. His name's Kelly.
Used to be a lieutenant.

512
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:17,961
Pretty good, too, until they gave him orders
to attack the wrong hill.

513
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,713
Wiped out half a company of GI's.

514
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:22,048
Somebody had to get the blame,
and he got picked.

515
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:28,930
Oh, man, I don't like officers.

516
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:36,229
Neither does he, so relax.

517
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:42,736
Get me Hogan in Intelligence.

518
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:47,073
- Hey, Crapgame.
- Yeah?

519
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:50,577
You mind I take this bar of gold
and show it to the boys?

520
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:54,497
No, not at all. Just remember
where you found it. Bring it back here.

521
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,585
You' re a good boy, Crapgame.

522
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,838
Something's wrong with him.

523
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:05,091
Hello, Hogan? It's Crapgame.

524
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:07,802
I got you the scotch
and the nylons you wanted.

525
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:09,888
Yeah.

526
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:11,723
Do I ever fail you?

527
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:15,101
You better believe it. Never miss.

528
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:16,895
Listen...

529
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:20,815
...I, uh, got a little favor to ask of you.

530
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:26,071
Will you stop crying,
I haven't even asked you yet.

531
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:28,114
What's the matter with you?

532
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:50,303
You wait here, padre.

533
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:03,316
I warned you, if you started anything,
I'd bust you out.

534
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:08,738
If you transfer me, Joe...

535
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:11,157
...you have to transfer every man
in this outfit.

536
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:12,867
I told you to lay off these guys.

537
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:15,328
Take it easy.
Kelly's got the whole thing figured.

538
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:17,622
Who invited you, Hustler?

539
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:20,375
- He did.
Hey, Joe.

540
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:25,171
It's a snap.
16 million just waiting to be picked up.

541
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:27,924
Did he forget to tell you
it's behind enemy lines?

542
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,051
- I told them.
Yeah?

543
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:33,346
Did you tell them how to get through
and cover 30 miles to Clermont?

544
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:34,806
- I told them.
- Then tell me.

545
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:36,975
Listen, Kelly's got it figured pretty good.

546
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:39,269
Listen?
This guy's gonna get you all killed.

547
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,563
We' re getting killed now, pal,
for $50 a month.

548
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:42,814
Damn right.

549
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:45,108
What good is a bonus gonna do
when you're dead?

550
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:47,902
The risk is the same we've been
taking since the beaches.

551
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:50,530
Only then you didn't have a choice,
now you do.

552
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:53,283
Three days from now we're going back
into the line, Joe.

553
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,535
But this time we're doing it
for ourselves.

554
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:59,539
Kelly's even got us armor support.

555
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,666
What armor?

556
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:04,210
Three Shermans from the 321 st.

557
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:05,378
Who's in command?

558
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:08,214
It's a top-line outfit.
I personally recommend these guys.

559
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:12,552
You butt out. The only time you come out
of the ground is when you smell a profit.

560
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,263
I'm coming out now
because Kelly has the perfect caper.

561
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:18,808
For you it's a vacation. Six days
out of seven you're behind the lines.

562
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:22,270
We' re at the broken end of a bottle
all the time, so you butt out.

563
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:27,817
Who's in command?

564
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,737
- Guy named Oddball.
- Oddball? He's a freak.

565
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,906
He's got three Shermans all ready to go.

566
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:35,742
What guarantee is that?
He's ready to go? He's a nut.

567
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,912
Well, we' re all nuts
or we wouldn't be here.

568
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:44,167
Hey, look.
Let me tell you guys something.

569
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,587
There's certain rules and regulations
governing the fighting of a war.

570
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:51,799
And the first one is that
you never stick your neck out for nobody.

571
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:54,344
Unless you're some kind of a hero type.

572
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:57,180
And I haven't seen any hero types
around here lately.

573
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:59,432
Talking's not gonna do any good, Joe.

574
00:42:01,393 --> 00:42:04,020
These men are all going.

575
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:07,690
And who's gonna lead them?

576
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:12,487
If you don't, I will.

577
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:25,166
Just listen to Kelly for a minute, Joe.
He's got it all sewed, man.

578
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:29,128
The route, the timing,
the supplies, everything.

579
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:37,470
Sure.

580
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:55,154
What do you say, corporal?

581
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:59,951
Oh, I don't know, Joe.

582
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:04,497
I figure if I got to go, it might just as well
be this trip as the next one.

583
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:12,755
- Penn?
- I'm for it.

584
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:27,061
How about it, Cowboy?

585
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:30,398
I reckon I'm gonna have to go along
with it, Joe.

586
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:34,444
They' re all for it, Joe.

587
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:41,284
What happens when Maitland finds out
we're not here?

588
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:44,621
He'll figure we've been sent back
to the front lines.

589
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:47,957
Man, he never knows where we are anyway.

590
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:05,224
Okay, show me what you've got.

591
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:19,864
The road's 10 yards beyond those
trees. Let me look at that map, will you?

592
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:21,991
What happens
if they put up road blocks?

593
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:24,869
Doesn't matter. All that matters
is Mulligan being on time.

594
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:28,498
Mulligan is on time.
On time and on target.

595
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,208
And he ain't ever been that yet.

596
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:32,543
Well, there's always a first time.

597
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:36,005
I figure the town is about
a quarter of a mile straight ahead.

598
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:40,093
- What happens if it isn't there?
- It better be. I went through it last night.

599
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:42,929
Only got a few minutes left,
so let's get moving.

600
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:45,890
Stick close to me, huh?
I don't want to be waiting on anyone.

601
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:47,725
We'll be there, Kelly.

602
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:50,812
All right. Move out, Cowboy.

603
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:54,774
Ooh. That nut has got to be nuts.

604
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:59,779
Everything all right, Kelly?
- Everything's all right.

605
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:02,448
You sure you got the time straight
with Mulligan?

606
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:05,159
Yeah, I got the time straight
with Mulligan.

607
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:08,788
Whether Mulligan can tell time or not
is another question.

608
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:13,519
Fire.

609
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:19,168
That crazy Mulligan's dropping them
all over the place.

610
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:09,385
You mother.

611
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:58,434
- Joe. Come on.
- Shut up, you pain in the ass.

612
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:46,899
This man is the man I have
on my mind today.

613
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:50,778
I'll tell you who he is.
This is my opposite number.

614
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:54,365
General Bogel, commanding
the Second German Armored Division.

615
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:58,869
When I look at that face,
I can read that character.

616
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:01,122
This guy's a loser.

617
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:04,000
Here I am sitting in his headquarters.

618
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:06,544
I'm drinking his scotch.

619
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:11,007
Hell, I've even got one of his broads
hanging around here somewhere.

620
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:13,926
The guy's a born loser...

621
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:17,972
...but you, gentlemen,
have not buried him yet.

622
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:20,266
You call yourselves leaders of men?

623
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:22,351
They' re putting up strong resistance.

624
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:25,146
Come on, Roach.
I flew over the battlefield this morning.

625
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:29,191
I could march a divisional dress parade
with band music right through their line.

626
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:32,403
- What about our flanks, sir?
- Aw, the hell with your flanks.

627
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:35,740
How many times have I got to tell you?
Forget about your flanks.

628
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:38,784
There's still a half a Panzer division
between here and Nancy.

629
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:41,203
Without gas. Without gas, gentlemen.

630
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:43,956
They' re getting gas, sir.
It's coming up at night.

631
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:46,625
- How?
By truck.

632
00:50:46,793 --> 00:50:50,838
The Air Force has got my orders to blow
every bridge in this sector out of existence.

633
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:54,633
They' re doing it and the Germans
are rebuilding the bridges every night.

634
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:57,344
We' re supposed to blow them up
again in the daytime.

635
00:50:57,512 --> 00:51:00,514
- Get me those aerial photographs.
- Right, sir.

636
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:05,478
General, last night someone gave orders
to redirect our mortar fire...

637
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:07,646
...against some damn crossroads.

638
00:51:07,814 --> 00:51:12,234
Listen, Roach. I don't want any excuses
out of you, you hear me?

639
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:16,906
All I want is to know why this loser of a
general is keeping me the hell out of Nancy.

640
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:19,366
Sir, we haven't got the supplies.

641
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:20,993
It's just a matter of logistics.

642
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:22,453
Logistics?
Yes, sir.

643
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:25,623
We've got logistics
coming out of our ears.

644
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:29,460
What we need is fighting spirit.
The will to win.

645
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:31,837
Where are those aerial photographs?

646
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:34,090
I'm sorry. They don't seem to be here.

647
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:35,758
They don't what?

648
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:37,176
I can't locate them, sir.

649
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:39,845
Eh...

650
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:44,475
...did you lose my aerial photographs?

651
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:58,197
Well... It looks to me
like there ain't no bridges still up.

652
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:00,199
What's this here?

653
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,327
It's a bridge.

654
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:05,538
Looks like some kind of
railroad bridge, huh?

655
00:52:05,705 --> 00:52:07,373
- Beautiful.
Yeah.

656
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:11,710
Even if we make that...

657
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:15,756
...we've still got a river to cross later on.
Right over there.

658
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:19,301
Let Kelly worry about that. Our problem
is getting through German lines.

659
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:21,846
- Right?
- Right.

660
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:23,597
How?

661
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:26,392
It's a railroad bridge, ain't it?
- Yeah.

662
00:52:26,768 --> 00:52:27,810
Well, then, beautiful.

663
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:31,355
We swing down onto the railroad tracks
and right over the mother bridge.

664
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:34,608
"And over the mother bridge. " Sure.

665
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:36,569
Suppose the bridge ain't there?

666
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:42,533
Oh, man.

667
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:45,995
Don't hit me with them negative waves
so early in the morning.

668
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:51,250
Think that bridge will be there
and it will be there.

669
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:56,672
It's a mother, beautiful bridge
and it's gonna be there.

670
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:00,426
Okay?

671
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:03,012
Okay, chief.

672
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,934
Okay.

673
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:12,563
Mount up.

674
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:17,193
How many, Grace?

675
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:18,944
Eight.

676
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:24,617
Penn?
Seven.

677
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:31,999
How many, Kelly?

678
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:35,127
Uh, three's fine.

679
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:44,261
Cowboy?

680
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:49,475
Oh, about six and I figure
about eight loose.

681
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:51,101
How about you, Willard?

682
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:53,062
About the same.

683
00:54:00,278 --> 00:54:02,696
How many clips did you use last night?

684
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:05,532
- About eight.
- Eight.

685
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:09,536
You' re trigger-happy, Gutkowski.
Here's two more.

686
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:11,830
Take it easy, okay?

687
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:14,500
Take it easy.

688
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:16,835
Want some K-rations, Crapgame?

689
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:18,837
No, thanks, kid.

690
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:21,674
I could use some water.
Do you got any water?

691
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:23,550
Mm, okay.

692
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:25,970
I'm gonna get some water, okay, kid?

693
00:54:34,479 --> 00:54:36,355
Hey, uh, who are you writing to?

694
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:37,982
Your mother?

695
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:39,775
Yeah.

696
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:44,530
- Do you write often?
- Yeah.

697
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:49,410
- Where are you from?
- Indianapolis.

698
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:55,207
- Do you miss your mother?
- Yeah.

699
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:00,421
Good talking to you, kid.

700
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:09,847
Hey, Kelly.

701
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:11,849
Kelly?

702
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:14,226
Big Joe wants to see you
over at the command jeep.

703
00:55:26,197 --> 00:55:27,948
Something wrong?

704
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:30,659
Yeah, just a few little things, Kelly.

705
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:32,411
According to this map...

706
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:35,664
...we got a river to cross before we get
into this town of yours.

707
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:38,917
Yeah, well, there's a bridge right here.
Six miles out.

708
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:40,210
There was a bridge.

709
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:42,921
The Air Corps knocked every bridge
out of that river months ago.

710
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:46,091
Unh-unh. Reports have the Air Corps
knocking them out by day...

711
00:55:46,259 --> 00:55:48,761
...and the Germans rebuilding them
by night.

712
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:53,265
All we have to do is get there tomorrow
at dawn and we've got ourselves a bridge.

713
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:57,978
How about the German Army? Do you
think they'd mind us crossing their bridge?

714
00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:00,689
Probably.

715
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:02,274
You know something, Kelly?

716
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:06,111
I think you're crazy.
Better yet, I think I'm crazy.

717
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:08,447
How did I let you talk these guys
into this?

718
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:11,867
Push 30 miles behind enemy lines,
take a bridge held by Germans...

719
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:15,746
...then go into a town that we don't know
how many German soldiers are guarding.

720
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:20,209
I figure there's between 30 and 40 troops
in that town.

721
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:22,711
All right. How did you figure that?

722
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:27,132
Well, uh, it's of no military importance.
It's not big enough for a garrison.

723
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:31,261
You still didn't answer the question, Kelly.
How did you figure 30 or 40 men?

724
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:39,853
Because that's the normal amount
of support for three Tiger tanks.

725
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:42,981
Tigers?

726
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:45,818
Where the hell
did the Tigers come from?

727
00:56:46,611 --> 00:56:48,987
That's why we have Oddball
and his Shermans.

728
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:51,824
- Does he know about the Tigers?
- Not yet, no.

729
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:53,575
You bet your sweet ass he doesn't.

730
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:55,994
Or he'd still be on that funny farm of his.

731
00:56:56,162 --> 00:56:59,665
He may be nuts, but he's not crazy enough
to put Shermans up against Tigers.

732
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:01,333
Once these things get rolling...

733
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:04,711
...they're gonna blow that whole town
to pieces, including us, Kelly.

734
00:57:04,879 --> 00:57:07,464
You're too smart to let that happen, Joe.

735
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:10,008
You'll figure us a way in and out
of that town.

736
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:12,219
I know you've got a good head
for tactics.

737
00:57:16,724 --> 00:57:21,103
Yeah? And I intend to keep it right here
on my shoulders, Kelly.

738
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:24,898
With these Tigers, this operation goes
above and beyond the call of duty.

739
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:28,610
That's right, Joe.

740
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:32,114
16 million above and beyond.

741
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:33,407
Hey, look, Kelly.

742
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:37,035
You' re pressing these guys' luck.
They've only got so much of it left.

743
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:38,871
It's a long, long way to Berlin.

744
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:42,541
And they're gonna need every inch of that
luck before this cockamamie war is over.

745
00:57:44,669 --> 00:57:45,752
Cover!

746
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:09,735
Come on, on the double.
Let's get the equipment out of the trucks.

747
00:58:19,412 --> 00:58:22,164
On the double, move it out. Here.

748
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:27,836
Cover. Take cover.

749
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:50,692
Hey. Hey.

750
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:52,486
That idiot's one of ours.

751
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:54,613
Holy crap.

752
00:59:06,292 --> 00:59:10,462
Oh... Our hero.

753
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:20,847
Man, this is crazy, isn't it, Willard?

754
00:59:21,015 --> 00:59:24,434
Get the number of that plane?
Who you gonna file a complaint with?

755
00:59:24,602 --> 00:59:26,645
- Move it out, move it out.
Yeah, yeah.

756
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:29,606
- Still think we can make it, wise guy?
- We can still try.

757
00:59:29,774 --> 00:59:32,109
Well, Oddball better show up, Kelly.

758
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:35,279
That's all I gotta say, he'd better show up.

759
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:38,782
Move it out.

760
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:43,328
All right, how is it?

761
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:44,830
Shot.

762
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:48,834
- There's a hole right through the cylinder.
- How about the radio equipment?

763
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:52,838
- The pack radio is okay. The rest has had it.
- Pick it up and take it with you.

764
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:55,841
- I got your equipment, Joe.
- Bring it.

765
00:59:57,343 --> 00:59:59,886
I told you. We should've never gone in
on this deal.

766
01:00:00,805 --> 01:00:03,890
- Well, you never told me.
- Yes, I did.

767
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:08,812
This why we pay taxes?
To be bombed by our own Air Force?

768
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:12,524
- Damn right.
- Hey, Kelly. Kelly.

769
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:14,109
What do we do now?

770
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:18,322
Pick up our equipment and get out of here
before a German patrol comes along.

771
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:21,366
Oh, that's great.

772
01:00:21,534 --> 01:00:24,286
Let's move all that stuff
up to the wall, on the double.

773
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:25,996
- Everybody all right?
- I think so.

774
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:27,914
- What happened, Joe?
- What happened?

775
01:00:28,082 --> 01:00:30,667
- Where the hell have you been?
- I had to go.

776
01:00:30,835 --> 01:00:32,127
We all have to go.

777
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:36,214
Come on. We've got 20 miles to walk
and nine hours to walk it in, so move it out.

778
01:00:36,382 --> 01:00:38,884
Big Joe? Do I gotta carry
all this equipment...

779
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:42,471
...this satchel charge
and this. 30 caliber machine gun, too?

780
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:44,389
Give the. 30 caliber to the Hustler.

781
01:00:44,557 --> 01:00:46,808
He wants to be a hero.

782
01:00:50,688 --> 01:00:53,690
Here you are, old buddy. Ha-ha-ha.

783
01:00:53,858 --> 01:00:57,486
Thanks. Get yourself a bucket of grits.

784
01:01:02,617 --> 01:01:05,577
All right, corporal, let's go.
Move them out. Move it out, Penn.

785
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:08,372
- Yeah, yeah, move them out.
- It's a long way.

786
01:01:08,539 --> 01:01:10,374
All right, thank you. Move it out.

787
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:11,917
Kelly, get on the point.

788
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,837
How come you got me elected
to carry this?

789
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:18,799
You wanted in on this?
Then learn to carry your own load.

790
01:01:18,966 --> 01:01:20,884
Come on, move it out.

791
01:01:21,302 --> 01:01:23,470
Yeah, up yours.

792
01:01:58,047 --> 01:02:02,801
Take it easy, take it easy.
Take it easy. Okay, hold it. Hold it.

793
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:09,349
Looks like we've got
a military installation up ahead.

794
01:02:09,517 --> 01:02:13,478
So make it the same deal as before.
We'll go into a triangular formation.

795
01:02:13,646 --> 01:02:16,815
I'll go down the slot.
Moe, you go down the right flank.

796
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:18,859
Whiskey, down the left. Keep it tight.

797
01:02:19,026 --> 01:02:22,946
Don't break it up until I give you the word.
Okay, button up and let's go.

798
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:49,681
The flowers are blooming
It's a beautiful day

799
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:53,643
There's a girl with a heart

800
01:02:53,811 --> 01:02:57,439
As big as the sky

801
01:02:57,607 --> 01:03:01,693
She's sunshine
And I know why

802
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:03,403
Fire.

803
01:03:05,364 --> 01:03:18,502
All for the love of sunshine

804
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:28,595
Fire.

805
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:38,897
Hit it.

806
01:03:46,906 --> 01:03:49,616
All right, lay four rounds in there heavy.

807
01:03:52,453 --> 01:03:54,079
Come on, move it. Fire.

808
01:04:16,102 --> 01:04:17,602
Hit it.

809
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:25,318
Fire.

810
01:04:31,284 --> 01:04:32,617
Bring him around hard.

811
01:04:45,798 --> 01:04:47,299
Hit it.

812
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:50,802
Fire.

813
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:45,315
Every time I go to town
A boy started kickin' my dog around

814
01:05:45,483 --> 01:05:50,320
It makes no difference if he is a hound
You better stop kickin' my dog around

815
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:52,739
Go on, Blue

816
01:05:55,159 --> 01:05:57,243
You good dog, you

817
01:05:57,411 --> 01:05:59,537
All right, Petuko.
Right, Joe.

818
01:05:59,705 --> 01:06:01,539
Move them out, corporal.

819
01:06:01,707 --> 01:06:03,375
Let's go, Babra.

820
01:06:03,542 --> 01:06:06,086
Wake up, Gutkowski. Let's go.

821
01:06:06,253 --> 01:06:08,046
Let's go, Kelly.

822
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:10,382
All right, Hustler, let's go.

823
01:06:10,549 --> 01:06:12,300
Hey, Kelly.

824
01:06:12,551 --> 01:06:16,388
This was your idea. How come
we don't go back to our own lines?

825
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:19,724
It's further back to ours
than it is to where we' re going.

826
01:06:19,892 --> 01:06:22,894
I know what, let's surrender. I'm hungry.

827
01:06:23,062 --> 01:06:24,354
Come on.

828
01:06:24,522 --> 01:06:26,314
All right. I buy it.

829
01:06:26,482 --> 01:06:28,733
I'll make it $50
if you carry the machine gun, huh?

830
01:06:28,901 --> 01:06:29,985
You got it on you?

831
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:32,570
- Don't you trust me?
- No, I don't.

832
01:06:32,738 --> 01:06:35,448
What do you think I am, a vault?
You think I carry money?

833
01:06:35,616 --> 01:06:37,909
I ask you a favor
and you don't want to help me?

834
01:06:38,077 --> 01:06:41,079
All I asked you is to carry
the machine gun. I'll give you $100.

835
01:06:41,247 --> 01:06:43,331
Do you have it?
No, I don't have it on me.

836
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:45,917
Shut up.

837
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:47,836
Ah, you guys keep quiet.

838
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:56,261
It's still up.

839
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:15,989
No, it ain't.

840
01:07:20,077 --> 01:07:23,371
You see what sending out
them negative waves did, Moriarty?

841
01:07:23,539 --> 01:07:25,373
That ain't my fault, Oddball.

842
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:29,127
I've done nothing but have good thoughts
about that bridge ever since we left.

843
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:31,129
What happens now?

844
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:35,467
It looks like we're gonna find ourselves
another bridge.

845
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:38,219
Where are we gonna come up
with another bridge?

846
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:42,974
There you go, more negative waves.
Have a little faith, baby.

847
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:45,393
Have a little faith.

848
01:07:47,438 --> 01:07:49,981
Now go on, get down into your hole.

849
01:07:50,524 --> 01:07:52,817
Move out.

850
01:08:07,833 --> 01:08:11,836
42nd Engineers. Bridging Unit.
Corporal Roamer speaking.

851
01:08:13,798 --> 01:08:17,675
Hey, Sarge. It's Oddball.

852
01:08:19,011 --> 01:08:21,304
All right, watch my outfit.

853
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:25,934
Yeah.

854
01:08:28,187 --> 01:08:31,356
Don't try to be funny, Oddball.
What do you want?

855
01:08:32,274 --> 01:08:36,820
I'm telephoning you from a caf
about 10 miles south of Mesurier.

856
01:08:36,987 --> 01:08:38,822
I wondered if you could do me a favor.

857
01:08:39,156 --> 01:08:40,782
Mesurier?

858
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:45,036
I got a map here someplace that says we
haven't even captured that place already.

859
01:08:45,204 --> 01:08:48,540
Yeah, so I heard.
Everybody seems very friendly.

860
01:08:48,707 --> 01:08:51,793
Look, baby, I'm kind of hung up.
I need about 60 feet of bridge.

861
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:56,089
How am I supposed to get 60 feet of
bridge 10 miles behind the German lines?

862
01:08:56,257 --> 01:09:00,385
I'm about to put you onto something good
and you are giving me your problems.

863
01:09:00,553 --> 01:09:04,639
This sector's so screwed, nobody knows
where the German lines or our lines are.

864
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:06,307
I got through with no problem.

865
01:09:06,475 --> 01:09:10,562
I've got a bank back here with 16 million
waiting to be picked up. Are you in?

866
01:09:10,729 --> 01:09:13,940
Listen, they haven't got you back
in the nut ward again, have they?

867
01:09:14,108 --> 01:09:15,567
Bellamy. For crying out loud.

868
01:09:15,734 --> 01:09:18,403
That is the lousiest, stinking,
most awful, stupid joke.

869
01:09:18,571 --> 01:09:21,239
You' re always pulling
that stinking, awful, stupid joke.

870
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:24,868
You don't want in this thing, don't get in.
I cut you out of everything.

871
01:09:25,035 --> 01:09:28,663
I don't need you, 60 feet of bridge,
I can pick up almost anywhere. Schmuck.

872
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:30,456
All right, all right, all right.

873
01:09:30,624 --> 01:09:34,627
Look, with three tanks, it's easy.
With a 60-foot bridge it's something else.

874
01:09:34,795 --> 01:09:38,631
I need support units, Oddball.
I need at least 100 guys.

875
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:41,718
Where do I find 100 men, just like that?

876
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:11,915
Eighteen miles to...

877
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:14,292
Jerks.

878
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:18,463
I couldn't have blown 13, 18, 14,
switch the other guys. Aah.

879
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:46,866
- Joe.
- Shut up.

880
01:10:48,744 --> 01:10:51,246
We've walked into a minefield.

881
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:56,167
- All right, who bought it?
- It's Grace.

882
01:10:58,337 --> 01:10:59,796
Joe.

883
01:11:00,547 --> 01:11:03,174
There's a road right up here
at the edge of the field.

884
01:11:04,134 --> 01:11:06,386
You mark that spot
and you head for the road.

885
01:11:07,012 --> 01:11:08,680
Everybody.

886
01:11:08,847 --> 01:11:10,223
Take out your bayonets...

887
01:11:11,183 --> 01:11:12,892
...and move towards Kelly.

888
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:14,185
Corporal.

889
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:16,562
Move the men down slowly.

890
01:11:16,730 --> 01:11:18,189
- Mitchell?
Yo!

891
01:11:18,357 --> 01:11:21,192
You pick up Grace's B.A.R.
and head this way.

892
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:24,279
Jonesey, for Christ's sake, stand still.

893
01:11:25,030 --> 01:11:26,030
Corporal?

894
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:31,077
Go see if Grace is still alive.
Jonesey, will you get the hell down?

895
01:12:32,681 --> 01:12:35,558
- Looks all right up here.
- Right.

896
01:12:35,809 --> 01:12:39,771
All right, you guys,
keep it moving. Stay careful.

897
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:45,151
Hey, hey, hey.

898
01:12:45,319 --> 01:12:47,779
Hey, I found one.

899
01:12:49,573 --> 01:12:50,615
What kind is it?

900
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:55,119
The kind that blows up.
How the hell do I know what kind it is?

901
01:12:55,287 --> 01:12:57,455
Mark the spot and keep moving, Hustler.

902
01:12:58,165 --> 01:13:00,166
I'll mark it.

903
01:13:15,891 --> 01:13:19,435
Gutkowski, get down there
on that bend and keep an eye out.

904
01:13:39,665 --> 01:13:42,333
Okay, bring the B.A.R.

905
01:14:21,707 --> 01:14:24,500
Penn, get that. 30 caliber set up
the other side of the wall.

906
01:14:24,668 --> 01:14:26,043
Right.

907
01:14:26,795 --> 01:14:30,173
I could've been in the States
playing Ping-Pong, volleyball...

908
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:32,383
...plenty of broads.

909
01:14:33,510 --> 01:14:35,386
Who the hell needs all this?

910
01:14:35,554 --> 01:14:39,098
I'm gonna get my knife
and get the hell out of here.

911
01:14:39,266 --> 01:14:41,225
Damn lousy equipment.

912
01:14:41,393 --> 01:14:43,686
Now I got to lift up this cannon.

913
01:14:43,854 --> 01:14:46,898
Carry it all the way
to the front line someplace.

914
01:14:47,191 --> 01:14:50,902
The damn thing is heavier
than Kelsey's burgers.

915
01:14:51,236 --> 01:14:54,280
Sure, I'll get a rupture yet
with this damn thing.

916
01:15:04,708 --> 01:15:06,334
Move it now.

917
01:15:06,627 --> 01:15:08,794
On the double, across the road.

918
01:15:08,962 --> 01:15:11,297
Go ahead, Babra,
stay on Kelly's path all the way.

919
01:15:11,465 --> 01:15:13,132
On the double.

920
01:15:14,134 --> 01:15:16,761
Come on, Hustler. Move it.
It's all safe for you, now.

921
01:15:16,929 --> 01:15:19,847
"Move it. " I hope you have
to take the gas pipe. You creep.

922
01:15:20,015 --> 01:15:22,725
- Stay on Kelly's path the whole way.
- Go to hell.

923
01:15:22,893 --> 01:15:24,435
Let's go, Cowboy. Move it.

924
01:15:24,603 --> 01:15:26,521
Come on, Willard. Let's mount up, boy.

925
01:15:26,688 --> 01:15:28,648
Anything we can do for you, corporal?

926
01:15:28,815 --> 01:15:30,274
No, thanks, Cowboy. We're all right.

927
01:15:30,692 --> 01:15:33,569
- Come on, Willard. Hit it.
I'm ready.

928
01:15:34,279 --> 01:15:38,032
Hey. Hey, Kelly.

929
01:15:38,283 --> 01:15:40,201
How did we get talked into this mess?

930
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:42,453
It took 10 seconds to talk you into this.

931
01:15:42,871 --> 01:15:46,791
But we were supposed to ride, not walk.
Nobody said anything about mines...

932
01:15:46,959 --> 01:15:49,502
...or schlepping this machine gun
all over the country.

933
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:52,713
Quit your bitching and just remember
what's at the end of the line.

934
01:15:52,881 --> 01:15:56,133
GUTKOWSKl:
Kelly. Kelly.

935
01:16:02,182 --> 01:16:03,808
Joe, there's a patrol coming in.

936
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:06,269
All right, Kelly, spread them out
across the road.

937
01:16:06,436 --> 01:16:08,813
Move it. Your crabs will leave you now.

938
01:16:08,981 --> 01:16:12,024
Get that gun set up
on the other side of the wall.

939
01:16:16,071 --> 01:16:17,530
Move.

940
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:19,949
Move it, Petuko, move it.

941
01:16:20,117 --> 01:16:22,868
- Don't forget about the broads.
- You horny bastard.

942
01:16:34,715 --> 01:16:38,301
Sergeant? Get the hell out of there.

943
01:16:38,802 --> 01:16:42,263
Corporal. You'll never make it.
We'll cover you from the road.

944
01:16:42,681 --> 01:16:45,933
- Don't move unless they spot you.
- Right. Go on.

945
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:50,855
Set up the B.A.R. there, Mitchell.

946
01:17:04,161 --> 01:17:07,913
All right, stay down, load up.
Stay down, load up.

947
01:17:11,835 --> 01:17:14,920
Stay down. Stay down, hold your fire.

948
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:23,596
Fisher. Grenades.

949
01:17:38,612 --> 01:17:42,031
- Let's get out of here. Let's go back.
Take it easy.

950
01:17:42,199 --> 01:17:44,867
It's too late, now.
We' re better off here, anyway.

951
01:17:45,202 --> 01:17:46,869
Get your head down.

952
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:20,861
Nice and easy.

953
01:18:48,348 --> 01:18:50,057
Stay down.

954
01:19:23,341 --> 01:19:26,010
All right. Get ready.

955
01:19:32,392 --> 01:19:33,893
Hold it.

956
01:19:34,853 --> 01:19:36,854
Fire.

957
01:20:22,776 --> 01:20:25,110
Let's go.

958
01:20:45,590 --> 01:20:48,509
- Jam.
- Clear it.

959
01:22:24,606 --> 01:22:26,523
Let's move it out.

960
01:22:30,111 --> 01:22:32,446
All right, you heard me.
I said, move it out.

961
01:22:37,118 --> 01:22:39,370
Maybe they' re only wounded.

962
01:22:39,704 --> 01:22:42,289
They' re dead, so forget it. Let's move.

963
01:23:39,431 --> 01:23:41,098
Hey.

964
01:23:41,474 --> 01:23:42,766
Hey.

965
01:23:42,934 --> 01:23:45,602
There's a whole column
of Shermans coming over the hill.

966
01:23:48,314 --> 01:23:51,150
Go get your packs.
Pick up your equipment.

967
01:24:01,786 --> 01:24:04,288
Go on down and load up.

968
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:07,583
Ready.

969
01:24:09,544 --> 01:24:11,336
Fire.

970
01:24:19,596 --> 01:24:22,139
I thought you said three Shermans.

971
01:24:22,307 --> 01:24:24,516
Those nuts have brought half the Army
with them.

972
01:24:32,817 --> 01:24:36,487
Okay, keep a move on.
Let's keep on coming.

973
01:24:36,946 --> 01:24:40,616
Come on. Okay, move on out.

974
01:24:50,043 --> 01:24:51,960
Are you ready for this?

975
01:24:52,128 --> 01:24:54,880
Split how many ways, stupid?

976
01:24:56,007 --> 01:24:58,008
Come on, Willard.

977
01:25:04,015 --> 01:25:07,810
What is this, huh? What is this,
a ball game? Who are these guys?

978
01:25:07,977 --> 01:25:09,561
They' re my friends, Crapgame.

979
01:25:09,729 --> 01:25:11,897
Friends? Where'd you find them?

980
01:25:12,065 --> 01:25:13,649
Here and there.

981
01:25:13,817 --> 01:25:17,194
- There's a bunch of refugees over there.
- It's a band.

982
01:25:17,612 --> 01:25:19,696
A band? What do we need a band for?

983
01:25:20,573 --> 01:25:24,076
Have a little faith, Crapgame.
They' re beautiful people.

984
01:25:25,245 --> 01:25:28,789
Kid, pull yourself together.
We ain't in the middle of Central Park.

985
01:25:28,957 --> 01:25:29,998
Oddball.

986
01:25:30,583 --> 01:25:34,628
How do you figure on moving through
enemy terrain with a column a mile long?

987
01:25:34,796 --> 01:25:37,673
Easy. We can fight. We got an army.

988
01:25:38,049 --> 01:25:42,302
Those freaks? That ain't an army,
it's a circus.

989
01:25:43,346 --> 01:25:45,222
Take it easy, Big Joe.

990
01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:48,350
Some of these people
have got sensitive feelings.

991
01:25:48,685 --> 01:25:51,520
- Who's the guy in charge?
- I am.

992
01:25:51,688 --> 01:25:53,730
What's the deal with the gold?

993
01:25:53,898 --> 01:25:57,109
Any man who gets to the town
and hits the bank, gets an equal share.

994
01:25:57,277 --> 01:25:59,736
But don't try to cross us.
There's gonna be trouble.

995
01:25:59,904 --> 01:26:02,239
- Who's going to make it, boy?
- I am.

996
01:26:02,407 --> 01:26:05,409
- Well, get out and start it.
Take it easy, big mouth.

997
01:26:05,577 --> 01:26:08,287
You get out of here.
Everybody else up on the tanks.

998
01:26:08,454 --> 01:26:10,747
Come on, let's move out.
- Don't double-cross us.

999
01:26:10,915 --> 01:26:13,584
- Any double-crossing will be your fat lip.
- Get moving.

1000
01:26:13,751 --> 01:26:14,751
Shut up.

1001
01:26:14,919 --> 01:26:17,421
Everybody up on that tank. Let's go.

1002
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:25,262
Kelly, we're not going
with those cowboys, are we?

1003
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:29,850
We got $16 million up for grabs and we're
not gonna let those clods beat us to it.

1004
01:26:30,018 --> 01:26:32,561
- Now, let's get moving.
- Yeah, yeah.

1005
01:26:55,084 --> 01:26:59,171
I say, Booker? Booker.

1006
01:26:59,380 --> 01:27:00,589
Yes, sir?

1007
01:27:00,757 --> 01:27:03,008
The old man was just on the line.

1008
01:27:03,426 --> 01:27:06,470
He says I've broken through
a long and entire front.

1009
01:27:06,638 --> 01:27:07,846
Why wasn't I told?

1010
01:27:08,348 --> 01:27:09,806
I don't know, sir.

1011
01:27:09,974 --> 01:27:12,142
You' re the communications officer,
ain't you?

1012
01:27:12,310 --> 01:27:14,478
You' re supposed to be able
to communicate.

1013
01:27:14,646 --> 01:27:17,481
Who's broken through
and how far have they gone?

1014
01:27:17,649 --> 01:27:19,066
Well, no one has, sir.

1015
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:21,818
It seems someone's found a hole
in the right flank.

1016
01:27:21,986 --> 01:27:25,697
They' re trying to push elements
of the 321 st and the 35th into it.

1017
01:27:25,865 --> 01:27:29,451
"Seems," Booker?
"Elements of the 321 st and 35th"?

1018
01:27:29,619 --> 01:27:32,329
Who's pushing them in there,
and where the hell are they?

1019
01:27:32,747 --> 01:27:34,331
I don't know, sir.

1020
01:27:34,499 --> 01:27:36,500
I'm coming down there, Booker.

1021
01:27:36,834 --> 01:27:40,212
What's the sense of a communications
officer who can't communicate?

1022
01:27:40,838 --> 01:27:43,757
Communication? He's more
like a damn military censor.

1023
01:27:43,925 --> 01:27:46,176
I'm back from Paris.
I got everything you wanted.

1024
01:27:46,344 --> 01:27:49,221
All I want is to know
whether we have broken through or not.

1025
01:27:49,389 --> 01:27:52,391
It's hard to say for certain, sir.
Nothing's been confirmed yet.

1026
01:27:52,809 --> 01:27:54,559
We've intercepted some signals...

1027
01:27:54,727 --> 01:27:58,522
...that suggest some kind of action
at a bridge near Clermont.

1028
01:27:58,690 --> 01:28:01,400
- Is that Clermont, Booker?
- Yes, sir.

1029
01:28:01,567 --> 01:28:03,402
Then why in the hell didn't you say so?

1030
01:28:03,987 --> 01:28:07,698
That's 30 miles beyond their lines.
You got them on the radio?

1031
01:28:07,865 --> 01:28:10,409
Yes, sir, but it's hard to pick them up
clearly, sir...

1032
01:28:10,576 --> 01:28:13,578
...this time in the morning.
Something to do with the ionosphere.

1033
01:28:13,746 --> 01:28:16,873
Get the ionosphere the hell off the air
and get them on.

1034
01:28:17,041 --> 01:28:19,543
Get out of there.
Do something else. Let me in.

1035
01:28:19,711 --> 01:28:22,087
- What's the frequency?
- 300 KC, sir.

1036
01:28:22,255 --> 01:28:25,090
You' re not gonna find them easy
to follow.

1037
01:28:25,258 --> 01:28:28,010
- They're using some kind of code.
- What kind of code?

1038
01:28:28,177 --> 01:28:31,430
Words like "bank heist, crapgame, big joe,
little joe, oddball... "

1039
01:28:31,597 --> 01:28:34,349
Hey, can
anybody get rid of that machine gun for me?

1040
01:28:34,517 --> 01:28:37,602
- There, yes, sir, there. That's it, that's them.
- Where?

1041
01:28:37,770 --> 01:28:41,315
There. Right on 300, sir. Right there.

1042
01:28:41,607 --> 01:28:44,901
There they are, sir. Those are the signals
we've been picking up.

1043
01:28:45,069 --> 01:28:47,404
Shut up and let me listen
to what they're saying?

1044
01:28:47,572 --> 01:28:50,240
Put Kelly on. Over.
Wilco. Over.

1045
01:28:50,408 --> 01:28:52,034
Oddball, this is Kelly.

1046
01:28:52,201 --> 01:28:55,162
Hey, Kelly, what the hell's
going on out there, man?

1047
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:59,207
It's cleared of infantry. What do
you hear from those other two tanks? Over.

1048
01:28:59,375 --> 01:29:03,754
No chance, man. They've both had it.
One's in the river, the other's burning.

1049
01:29:04,547 --> 01:29:07,257
Yeah, I can see them from here. Over.

1050
01:29:08,384 --> 01:29:09,426
Where's Big Joe?

1051
01:29:09,802 --> 01:29:13,263
Over on the other side. Get off
the line, I'll get in touch with him.

1052
01:29:13,431 --> 01:29:16,308
Fire. Okay. Over and out.

1053
01:29:17,226 --> 01:29:20,479
Kelly to Big Joe. Kelly to Big Joe. Over.

1054
01:29:20,646 --> 01:29:23,148
Kelly, it's Crapgame.
What's happening there? Over.

1055
01:29:23,691 --> 01:29:27,069
They' re dropping artillery
all over the place. That's what's happening.

1056
01:29:27,236 --> 01:29:28,320
Where's Big Joe? Over.

1057
01:29:28,905 --> 01:29:31,782
He's not here. He's pinned down
under the bridge. Over.

1058
01:29:31,949 --> 01:29:34,242
- Well, get him for me. Over.
Okay.

1059
01:29:34,410 --> 01:29:37,746
Damn. Are we losing them?
We just had them good a minute ago.

1060
01:29:37,914 --> 01:29:40,082
I'm doing it, Booker.

1061
01:29:40,416 --> 01:29:41,541
Quiet.

1062
01:29:41,709 --> 01:29:43,460
What do you want me to do with this?

1063
01:29:43,628 --> 01:29:47,130
Get the hell out of here.
We've got the game on.

1064
01:29:57,850 --> 01:29:59,184
Kelly, this is Big Joe.

1065
01:29:59,769 --> 01:30:02,479
It's pretty clear over here,
except for the artillery.

1066
01:30:02,647 --> 01:30:06,691
The bridge is too far gone to get vehicles
across. You can bring the men over by foot.

1067
01:30:06,859 --> 01:30:08,693
Get them moving. Over.

1068
01:30:08,861 --> 01:30:12,114
Okay, I'll send them over
in twos and threes. Out.

1069
01:30:12,281 --> 01:30:16,618
Petuko, Willard, drop your packs
and take the equipment across the bridge.

1070
01:30:18,329 --> 01:30:20,580
Kelly, what did Big Joe say?

1071
01:30:21,791 --> 01:30:23,500
Says he's sending them across.

1072
01:30:23,668 --> 01:30:26,670
Tell him to hurry up.
It's getting hotter than hell here.

1073
01:30:30,091 --> 01:30:31,967
- What's going on?
- We're crossing over.

1074
01:30:32,135 --> 01:30:35,637
- You're not crossing over without us.
- Then grab your trucks and come on up.

1075
01:30:35,805 --> 01:30:39,015
- That bridge is too badly damaged to hold.
- You want to come, fix it.

1076
01:30:39,183 --> 01:30:41,351
Half my equipment's jammed up
in the rear.

1077
01:30:41,519 --> 01:30:46,106
Un-jam them. We've lost two tanks already.
I'm not sticking around to lose a third.

1078
01:30:46,274 --> 01:30:47,858
Listen, we made a deal.

1079
01:30:48,025 --> 01:30:51,695
Not with me, you didn't. Here. You talk
to Kelly. Cowboy, stay with the truck.

1080
01:30:51,863 --> 01:30:53,822
- Right.
Ready?

1081
01:30:53,990 --> 01:30:56,658
This is Bellamy for Kelly. Kelly?

1082
01:30:56,826 --> 01:30:59,953
We can't use the bridge.
We can't ford the river. The bed's too soft.

1083
01:31:00,121 --> 01:31:02,497
So what do we do?
- Go, team, go. Go.

1084
01:31:02,665 --> 01:31:04,541
You've got bridging equipment. Over.

1085
01:31:04,959 --> 01:31:08,712
That's a five-hour operation.
Can you hold on for five hours? Over.

1086
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:11,256
No, no. Move. On, on. Move.

1087
01:31:11,674 --> 01:31:14,968
Bellamy, we're not gonna hold on
for five minutes. You can catch up.

1088
01:31:15,136 --> 01:31:18,763
Kelly, we're all in this together.
You can't go it alone. Over.

1089
01:31:19,223 --> 01:31:23,185
We' re not gonna wait five hours, either.
If you can't keep up, that's your problem.

1090
01:31:23,352 --> 01:31:26,104
Now, we're pulling out
and we're pushing forward. Over.

1091
01:31:26,272 --> 01:31:27,731
Attack. Attack. Attack.

1092
01:31:27,899 --> 01:31:31,193
That's the fighting spirit
I was talking about. Listen to that guy.

1093
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:33,778
- If he was a major, he's a colonel now.
Kelly.

1094
01:31:33,946 --> 01:31:38,241
This is a Grave Diggers Registration
Unit. We got a stake in this advance, too.

1095
01:31:38,409 --> 01:31:40,994
Did you ever hear enthusiasm
like that in all your life?

1096
01:31:41,162 --> 01:31:45,248
They've even got the damn Grave Diggers.
What the hell am I doing here?

1097
01:31:45,416 --> 01:31:48,418
Bonsor. Get me my uniform.

1098
01:31:49,337 --> 01:31:50,587
Get on!
Wonder where Cowboy is?

1099
01:31:50,755 --> 01:31:52,547
Give me that gun.

1100
01:31:52,715 --> 01:31:54,382
Break up that radio.

1101
01:31:54,550 --> 01:31:56,343
Faster, faster.

1102
01:31:56,511 --> 01:31:58,595
Hurry up, you guys,
we haven't got much time.

1103
01:31:58,763 --> 01:31:59,804
Get up.

1104
01:31:59,972 --> 01:32:01,932
Crapgame, do you like the Army?

1105
01:32:02,099 --> 01:32:04,267
Let's go. Let's get out of here.

1106
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:07,354
All right, let's move them out.

1107
01:32:09,774 --> 01:32:13,276
- This is it, Penn. We' re on our way, baby.
Cowboy, come on. Hurry up.

1108
01:32:13,444 --> 01:32:15,529
Here we go.
Come on.

1109
01:32:15,696 --> 01:32:19,115
Come on, Cowboy.
This train's leaving, boy.

1110
01:32:19,408 --> 01:32:21,660
Somebody grab that radio.

1111
01:32:22,203 --> 01:32:25,580
There you go. Come on, up, up.

1112
01:32:25,748 --> 01:32:27,791
Attaboy, come on.

1113
01:32:28,668 --> 01:32:30,460
That's it.

1114
01:32:35,424 --> 01:32:38,843
Booker, tell General Castle
that I want every man in this Army...

1115
01:32:39,011 --> 01:32:41,054
...on the road within the hour.
- Yes, sir.

1116
01:32:41,222 --> 01:32:42,806
I'm pushing on to the Rhine.

1117
01:32:42,974 --> 01:32:45,976
But, sir, Clermont's 30 miles
behind enemy lines.

1118
01:32:46,143 --> 01:32:48,019
That you, Maitland?

1119
01:32:48,187 --> 01:32:49,396
Just back from Paris, sir.

1120
01:32:49,564 --> 01:32:51,731
Get my vehicle and driver around here.

1121
01:32:51,899 --> 01:32:53,775
Bonsor, you get my box of medals.

1122
01:32:53,943 --> 01:32:57,070
I'm gonna decorate every man in this
penetration, whoever they are.

1123
01:32:57,238 --> 01:32:59,573
They saved the reputation
of this entire Army.

1124
01:32:59,740 --> 01:33:02,993
You' re supposed to fight this battle.
You don't even know where it is.

1125
01:33:03,160 --> 01:33:07,747
I'll tell you where it is. It's 30 miles
beyond where you thought it was, Booker.

1126
01:33:07,915 --> 01:33:10,667
Come on, now, let's get this Army of mine
back in the war.

1127
01:33:10,835 --> 01:33:12,335
Will you send that?

1128
01:34:04,889 --> 01:34:07,098
Think you ought to wait,
let the Army get there?

1129
01:34:07,266 --> 01:34:11,227
History waits for no man. I've got an
appointment with destiny in Clermont.

1130
01:34:11,395 --> 01:34:12,854
Take this weapon, Maitland.

1131
01:34:13,022 --> 01:34:14,856
All right, boy. Make this thing fly.

1132
01:34:15,024 --> 01:34:17,567
- General, your medals.
- Good luck, sir.

1133
01:34:59,652 --> 01:35:01,653
Kelly?
Yeah, Cowboy?

1134
01:35:01,821 --> 01:35:03,947
Kelly, we're in the bell tower
of the church.

1135
01:35:04,115 --> 01:35:07,117
You can see the whole town
from up here, almost.

1136
01:35:07,326 --> 01:35:10,286
There's not much happening.
I think they're still asleep.

1137
01:35:10,454 --> 01:35:14,165
There's three Tigers
in the square right down below us.

1138
01:35:14,542 --> 01:35:17,335
Do you see anything
that looks like it might be a bank?

1139
01:35:17,628 --> 01:35:20,463
Yeah, it's got to be this building
here to the right of us.

1140
01:35:20,631 --> 01:35:22,215
Can you see it from where you are?

1141
01:35:22,383 --> 01:35:24,884
They've got two machine guns
and guards on the roof.

1142
01:35:26,929 --> 01:35:30,473
I don't think I can see much
of the center of town from up here.

1143
01:35:32,268 --> 01:35:37,313
No, just a lot of rooftops
and bombed-out buildings.

1144
01:35:39,525 --> 01:35:43,027
Beside the tanks, can you see anything
that might house support units?

1145
01:35:43,821 --> 01:35:47,490
There's a big brown building
right behind the bank with a jeep...

1146
01:35:47,950 --> 01:35:51,161
...and two guards and about three trucks.

1147
01:35:51,328 --> 01:35:52,746
Hold it.

1148
01:35:57,501 --> 01:36:02,046
There's a German officer walking around
the bank towards the brown building.

1149
01:36:02,339 --> 01:36:03,548
Well, what do you think?

1150
01:36:03,716 --> 01:36:06,217
We shouldn't have trouble
unless it's with the Tigers.

1151
01:36:06,385 --> 01:36:09,012
We can take the machine gunners
on the roof from here.

1152
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:11,181
If you can keep them guys busy
for a while.

1153
01:36:11,348 --> 01:36:14,017
Or maybe we can go down
and get a closer look.

1154
01:36:14,185 --> 01:36:15,685
No, stay there. Keep an eye out.

1155
01:36:15,853 --> 01:36:18,354
See if you can find out
where those troops are housed.

1156
01:36:18,522 --> 01:36:19,647
Right.

1157
01:36:20,649 --> 01:36:22,317
What do you think, Oddball?

1158
01:36:22,485 --> 01:36:26,529
It's a wasted trip. Nobody said
nothing about locking horns with Tigers.

1159
01:36:26,697 --> 01:36:30,492
Look. You just keep those Tigers busy,
and we'll take care of the rest.

1160
01:36:30,659 --> 01:36:34,871
Ha, ha. The only way I got to keep the Tigers
busy is to let them shoot holes in me.

1161
01:36:35,873 --> 01:36:38,875
We just want you to keep them interested
for a while, that's all.

1162
01:36:39,043 --> 01:36:41,085
Man. You guys are crazy.

1163
01:36:41,253 --> 01:36:44,339
When we was in the bocage country,
we was assaulted by them Tigers.

1164
01:36:44,507 --> 01:36:47,258
You know what I mean by "assaulted"?
Well, I mean assaulted.

1165
01:36:47,426 --> 01:36:50,929
Why don't you knock it off
with them negative waves?

1166
01:36:51,347 --> 01:36:54,516
Why don't you dig
how beautiful it is out here?

1167
01:36:54,683 --> 01:36:59,979
Why don't you say something righteous
and hopeful for a change?

1168
01:37:00,147 --> 01:37:01,523
Crap.

1169
01:37:01,690 --> 01:37:04,776
All right, so it's a beautiful day.
Now, let's get down to cases.

1170
01:37:05,361 --> 01:37:07,946
The Tiger is an open-country tank.

1171
01:37:08,489 --> 01:37:12,075
We happen to have these in a small town
with narrow streets.

1172
01:37:12,243 --> 01:37:15,703
- And we do have the element of surprise.
- Yeah.

1173
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:20,416
Look, Kelly, a Tiger has
only one weak point. That's its ass.

1174
01:37:20,584 --> 01:37:23,753
You gotta hit it point blank
and you've gotta hit it from behind.

1175
01:37:23,921 --> 01:37:25,755
We do not have
the element of surprise.

1176
01:37:25,923 --> 01:37:30,635
They'll hear our Detroit motors
long before we even get inside that town.

1177
01:37:32,555 --> 01:37:36,975
What if I show you a way to get
into that town so they don't hear you?

1178
01:37:38,227 --> 01:37:39,435
Hey, Oddball?

1179
01:37:40,271 --> 01:37:44,482
This is your hour of glory,
and you're chickening out.

1180
01:37:44,984 --> 01:37:48,653
To a New Yorker like you,
a hero is some type of weird sandwich.

1181
01:37:48,821 --> 01:37:51,698
Not some nut who takes on three Tigers.

1182
01:37:52,116 --> 01:37:54,534
Nobody's asking you to be a hero.
No?

1183
01:37:55,077 --> 01:37:56,828
Then you sit up in that turret, baby.

1184
01:37:57,246 --> 01:37:59,247
No. Because you're gonna be up there,
baby.

1185
01:37:59,415 --> 01:38:02,959
And I'll be right outside
showing you which way to go.

1186
01:38:04,044 --> 01:38:06,629
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1187
01:38:08,424 --> 01:38:13,136
Crazy. I mean, like, so many positive waves,
maybe we can't lose. You're on.

1188
01:38:22,146 --> 01:38:25,106
- You guys got anything?
- No, not much.

1189
01:38:25,274 --> 01:38:28,860
They just keep coming and going
from the brown building behind the bank.

1190
01:38:30,404 --> 01:38:31,863
- Cowboy?
Yeah?

1191
01:38:32,031 --> 01:38:33,865
In 20 minutes, start ringing that bell.

1192
01:38:34,033 --> 01:38:36,159
And keep ringing it
as long as you can. Got it?

1193
01:38:36,327 --> 01:38:37,368
Right, Kelly.

1194
01:38:37,536 --> 01:38:41,497
Five minutes after that bell starts,
you get the guards on top of the bank.

1195
01:38:41,665 --> 01:38:42,707
Okay, Kelly.

1196
01:38:47,254 --> 01:38:49,213
All right, let's move out.

1197
01:39:45,479 --> 01:39:46,938
Kelly?

1198
01:39:48,190 --> 01:39:51,526
Kelly. Kelly.

1199
01:40:47,166 --> 01:40:50,293
- Hold it.
- Hold it.

1200
01:40:57,676 --> 01:40:58,718
Cowboy?

1201
01:40:58,886 --> 01:41:01,179
Yeah, Kelly, where in the heck are you,
man?

1202
01:41:01,680 --> 01:41:04,599
We' re just outside of town.
How's it look up there?

1203
01:41:04,767 --> 01:41:07,393
Well, it doesn't look too good from here.

1204
01:41:07,561 --> 01:41:09,896
They've got all those Tigers fired up
down there.

1205
01:41:10,064 --> 01:41:13,107
Looks like they're getting ready
for some heavy-duty action.

1206
01:41:13,275 --> 01:41:15,526
I think we ought to pull out of here, pal.

1207
01:41:15,694 --> 01:41:18,029
No, stay right there. What do you think?

1208
01:41:18,197 --> 01:41:19,363
That's just routine.

1209
01:41:19,531 --> 01:41:23,951
The Tigers turn their engines over
for, like, 20 minutes every three, four hours.

1210
01:41:24,119 --> 01:41:25,912
Just routine, Cowboy. You stay put.

1211
01:41:26,455 --> 01:41:28,206
Routine?

1212
01:41:29,291 --> 01:41:31,626
Boy, I sure hope you're right, Kelly.

1213
01:41:31,794 --> 01:41:35,171
Our asses are gonna be hanging out
up here if you ain't. I'm not kidding.

1214
01:41:35,339 --> 01:41:39,592
Nothing's gonna be hanging out.
Now, just relax. Out.

1215
01:41:40,094 --> 01:41:43,346
- Sure you're right about those Tigers?
- Sure, I'm right.

1216
01:41:43,514 --> 01:41:47,016
If those engines are turning over,
we can sneak right up the edge of town.

1217
01:41:47,184 --> 01:41:49,644
- Nobody would hear us. Right?
- Right.

1218
01:41:50,604 --> 01:41:52,396
Shall I move out?

1219
01:41:52,606 --> 01:41:54,023
Good man.

1220
01:41:54,191 --> 01:41:55,983
Move out.

1221
01:42:27,850 --> 01:42:29,517
Babra.

1222
01:43:19,943 --> 01:43:20,943
All right.

1223
01:43:55,479 --> 01:43:56,938
Come on.

1224
01:44:12,120 --> 01:44:13,913
Hold it.

1225
01:44:18,627 --> 01:44:21,337
Stay here, until I signal you.

1226
01:47:53,467 --> 01:47:55,176
I'm mounting up, partner.

1227
01:47:55,343 --> 01:47:58,512
Now, don't you get lonely up here
without me, now, you hear?

1228
01:50:21,573 --> 01:50:23,866
All right, let's go.
Switch it on and move it out.

1229
01:51:18,171 --> 01:51:21,465
- Hold it.
- Hold it.

1230
01:51:33,061 --> 01:51:35,354
Give me that hand radio.

1231
01:51:43,029 --> 01:51:45,948
Gutkowski? Gutkow...

1232
01:51:53,623 --> 01:51:56,125
The bell's making so damn much noise,
he can't hear.

1233
01:51:56,292 --> 01:51:58,293
I thought that was what you wanted.

1234
01:51:58,461 --> 01:52:02,798
So the Germans can't hear us.
Now, move them out. Slow.

1235
01:52:02,966 --> 01:52:05,426
Move out. Slow.

1236
01:52:47,385 --> 01:52:48,844
Now.

1237
01:53:14,871 --> 01:53:17,706
Hold it. Hold it.
Hold it.

1238
01:54:00,583 --> 01:54:02,251
Hold it.

1239
01:54:24,357 --> 01:54:28,026
It's a Mark 6. And we got it by the ass.

1240
01:55:12,739 --> 01:55:14,615
Fire.

1241
01:55:43,811 --> 01:55:45,938
Aah!

1242
01:56:08,086 --> 01:56:09,753
Stay down.

1243
01:56:36,572 --> 01:56:38,532
All right, move out.

1244
01:56:57,635 --> 01:56:58,677
Let's go.

1245
01:57:11,399 --> 01:57:13,025
All right, get out of here.

1246
01:57:13,401 --> 01:57:15,110
Moving out.

1247
01:58:23,846 --> 01:58:25,013
Crapgame?

1248
01:58:29,185 --> 01:58:30,852
Yeah.

1249
01:58:57,088 --> 01:58:58,713
Over there.

1250
01:58:59,132 --> 01:59:01,299
Come on, you idiot.

1251
01:59:08,266 --> 01:59:10,475
Hey. Hey, you jerk. Hey.

1252
01:59:10,643 --> 01:59:13,270
Hey, will you knock it off
with those cockamamie bells?

1253
01:59:13,437 --> 01:59:14,729
Kelly told me to ring them.

1254
01:59:14,897 --> 01:59:18,608
I know he told you, but they know
we're here already. So, knock it off.

1255
01:59:18,860 --> 01:59:22,696
God Almighty. Whoo. Phew.

1256
01:59:22,864 --> 01:59:25,323
You guys smell like you fell
into a dung heap.

1257
01:59:25,825 --> 01:59:28,243
It kind of makes you homesick, don't it?

1258
01:59:30,580 --> 01:59:34,749
- It does kind of, don't it, old buddy?
- Yeah. Heh.

1259
01:59:42,300 --> 01:59:43,717
Pull it.

1260
02:00:13,873 --> 02:00:16,333
- Let's go.
- All right, move out.

1261
02:00:28,304 --> 02:00:30,680
All right, ready to turn right.

1262
02:00:31,098 --> 02:00:32,641
Turn.

1263
02:00:37,396 --> 02:00:40,106
Now, hold it.

1264
02:00:42,902 --> 02:00:44,736
Fire.

1265
02:00:48,824 --> 02:00:50,242
- Wow.
- That's paint.

1266
02:00:50,409 --> 02:00:51,451
Load up.

1267
02:01:14,475 --> 02:01:17,310
Okay? Fire.

1268
02:01:34,704 --> 02:01:36,413
Hey.

1269
02:01:50,469 --> 02:01:53,847
We need explosives to get these open.
This place is built like Fort Knox.

1270
02:01:54,015 --> 02:01:56,850
Cowboy, check around and see
if there's a back door.

1271
02:02:03,357 --> 02:02:05,150
Can you see anything?

1272
02:02:06,068 --> 02:02:08,278
There's a big lump
in the middle of the floor.

1273
02:02:08,446 --> 02:02:11,156
There's a Tiger coming down the street.

1274
02:02:25,046 --> 02:02:27,422
Cowboy. Cowboy, come here.

1275
02:02:33,054 --> 02:02:36,723
Get ahold of his arm.
Take it easy, boy.

1276
02:02:37,099 --> 02:02:38,141
Easy, easy does it.

1277
02:02:38,309 --> 02:02:40,185
Don't tell me to take it easy.
You take it easy.

1278
02:03:39,912 --> 02:03:41,871
Hi, man.

1279
02:03:42,039 --> 02:03:43,164
What are you doing?

1280
02:03:43,332 --> 02:03:47,210
I'm drinking wine and eating cheese,
and catching some rays. You know?

1281
02:03:48,212 --> 02:03:49,879
What's happening?

1282
02:03:50,214 --> 02:03:52,966
The tank's broken
and they're trying to fix it.

1283
02:03:53,134 --> 02:03:54,509
Why aren't you helping them?

1284
02:03:55,052 --> 02:03:56,761
Oh, man.

1285
02:03:56,929 --> 02:03:59,973
I only ride them,
I don't know what makes them work.

1286
02:04:03,686 --> 02:04:05,437
Oh, creeps.

1287
02:04:07,398 --> 02:04:10,316
Definitely an anti-social type.

1288
02:04:11,068 --> 02:04:12,694
Arf, arf, arf, arf!

1289
02:04:12,862 --> 02:04:15,280
That's my other dog imitation.

1290
02:04:24,498 --> 02:04:27,459
- Where did he get it?
- Well, he got it right here in the leg.

1291
02:04:27,626 --> 02:04:29,752
- Anything else?
- What do you mean?

1292
02:04:30,379 --> 02:04:32,380
Ain't that enough for you?

1293
02:04:33,132 --> 02:04:36,009
- How do you feel, Hustler?
- Great.

1294
02:04:36,218 --> 02:04:38,178
Since when did you give a damn
how I felt?

1295
02:04:41,932 --> 02:04:44,392
Okay, wise guy, forget it.

1296
02:04:45,519 --> 02:04:47,228
Hey, Joe.

1297
02:04:48,189 --> 02:04:50,648
- Yeah?
- Come here.

1298
02:04:55,863 --> 02:04:57,322
What do you want?

1299
02:04:57,656 --> 02:04:59,491
How are things going with the bank?

1300
02:05:01,702 --> 02:05:02,994
Nothing.

1301
02:05:03,162 --> 02:05:07,207
The Sherman's broken down and nobody's
gonna move that Tiger out of the square.

1302
02:05:07,750 --> 02:05:10,210
- Then make a deal.
- What kind of a deal?

1303
02:05:10,753 --> 02:05:13,004
A "deal" deal.

1304
02:05:13,172 --> 02:05:14,714
Maybe the guy's a Republican.

1305
02:05:16,884 --> 02:05:18,927
Business is business.

1306
02:05:20,137 --> 02:05:21,262
Right?

1307
02:05:24,266 --> 02:05:25,600
Okay, big mouth.

1308
02:05:32,858 --> 02:05:36,444
Come on, Jonesey.
Get it going. Let's go. Get it going.

1309
02:05:36,612 --> 02:05:38,655
Come on, let's go. Get in there.
Come on.

1310
02:05:38,822 --> 02:05:41,157
Come on, let's go. Roll it in there.

1311
02:05:41,534 --> 02:05:44,035
Bellamy, come on.
We' re almost finished.

1312
02:05:44,203 --> 02:05:45,912
- What?
- It's ready.

1313
02:05:46,080 --> 02:05:48,998
Right. Okay, let's go.
Let's move it out here.

1314
02:05:49,166 --> 02:05:51,459
Come on, bring them around.

1315
02:05:51,877 --> 02:05:53,795
Ten-hut!

1316
02:05:54,255 --> 02:05:55,838
Where are you from, sergeant?

1317
02:05:56,048 --> 02:05:57,882
Jersey City.

1318
02:05:59,385 --> 02:06:02,095
Stand up straight
when the general speaks to you.

1319
02:06:02,388 --> 02:06:03,888
Don't you feel bad about it.

1320
02:06:04,348 --> 02:06:07,600
You' re a hell of a soldier,
and I just want to shake your hand.

1321
02:06:07,768 --> 02:06:11,104
All America's real proud of you today.

1322
02:06:11,897 --> 02:06:13,773
All right, come on.

1323
02:06:14,483 --> 02:06:17,193
I got a medal here in the jeep for you.

1324
02:06:17,945 --> 02:06:19,362
A medal?

1325
02:06:19,863 --> 02:06:23,533
16 million bucks, shot.

1326
02:06:24,118 --> 02:06:25,243
It's shot, Kelly.

1327
02:06:27,037 --> 02:06:29,497
Maybe we can use the fuel pump
from that Tiger.

1328
02:06:29,665 --> 02:06:31,541
No, it won't work on this motor.

1329
02:06:31,709 --> 02:06:34,252
- Mechanical genius.
Oh, man.

1330
02:06:34,628 --> 02:06:39,215
Oddball, I can't make it work without
the parts no matter how positive I think.

1331
02:06:39,633 --> 02:06:44,304
This guy in the Tiger, the least we could
do is get him on the radio and talk to him.

1332
02:06:44,471 --> 02:06:47,348
Are you crazy?
That guy's gotta be a full fanatic freak.

1333
02:06:47,516 --> 02:06:50,184
Otherwise he would've split
20 minutes ago.

1334
02:06:50,352 --> 02:06:54,731
Hey, all this guy is doing
is guarding the bank like he was told.

1335
02:06:55,983 --> 02:06:57,859
Yeah, maybe.

1336
02:06:58,652 --> 02:07:01,362
But I wonder if he knows what's in it.

1337
02:10:04,004 --> 02:10:06,464
- Cigarette?
No smoke.

1338
02:10:06,840 --> 02:10:10,802
The fuel system is rotten.
We have gasoline all over the place.

1339
02:10:13,347 --> 02:10:14,931
It's all right.

1340
02:10:15,349 --> 02:10:17,350
Hey, look, uh, Max...

1341
02:10:17,518 --> 02:10:20,645
...you and us, we' re just soldiers, right?

1342
02:10:20,813 --> 02:10:23,064
We don't even know
what this war's all about.

1343
02:10:23,232 --> 02:10:25,733
All we do is we fight and we die.
And for what?

1344
02:10:25,901 --> 02:10:28,027
We don't get anything out of it.

1345
02:10:28,362 --> 02:10:32,323
In about a half an hour, the American
Army's gonna be coming down that road.

1346
02:10:32,491 --> 02:10:37,203
Why don't you do yourself a big fat favor
and get the hell out of here?

1347
02:10:37,704 --> 02:10:39,080
I have orders.

1348
02:10:39,248 --> 02:10:42,083
This bank isn't to fall into the hands
of the American Army.

1349
02:10:42,501 --> 02:10:45,336
This bank's not gonna fall in the hands
of the American Army.

1350
02:10:45,504 --> 02:10:47,338
It's gonna fall in our hands.

1351
02:10:47,506 --> 02:10:49,924
You see, we're just
a private enterprise operation.

1352
02:10:50,551 --> 02:10:52,343
You the American Army.

1353
02:10:53,637 --> 02:10:56,013
No, baby, we ain't.

1354
02:10:56,431 --> 02:10:59,100
You know what's inside that bank, man?

1355
02:11:00,769 --> 02:11:05,273
There's $16 million worth of gold
in that bank, sweetheart.

1356
02:11:15,576 --> 02:11:20,288
That's about 65 million marks.

1357
02:11:20,455 --> 02:11:21,497
And, sergeant...

1358
02:11:22,541 --> 02:11:25,918
...all you have to do to have an equal share
of this money...

1359
02:11:26,128 --> 02:11:30,590
...is crank this turret around
and blow a hole in that door.

1360
02:13:42,806 --> 02:13:44,598
I told you.

1361
02:13:51,273 --> 02:13:52,314
No more payments.

1362
02:14:54,377 --> 02:14:56,670
You got it. Hit it.

1363
02:14:57,589 --> 02:14:59,715
Come on, Little Joe.

1364
02:14:59,883 --> 02:15:01,592
What are you going to do with yours?

1365
02:15:01,760 --> 02:15:04,345
Get me a new Hudson
with an electric shift.

1366
02:15:04,513 --> 02:15:09,850
I'm going to get me a ranch in Texas,
with about 10, 20, 35 women...

1367
02:15:10,811 --> 02:15:12,853
...and let it go. Ha-ha-ha.

1368
02:15:15,607 --> 02:15:19,693
- I told you it'd work, I told you.
- No, you never told me.

1369
02:15:19,861 --> 02:15:22,780
- You never told me.
- Come on, Babra, keep it moving.

1370
02:15:22,948 --> 02:15:26,033
One Cadillac coming up, Willard.
- No, I'm getting a pickup truck.

1371
02:15:29,162 --> 02:15:31,413
Okay, Crapgame, we got our cut,
I'm moving out.

1372
02:15:31,957 --> 02:15:34,125
Right. Take it easy, kid.

1373
02:15:35,460 --> 02:15:37,253
See you, Big Joe.

1374
02:15:37,420 --> 02:15:39,839
Heh. Okay. Stay lucky, you nut.

1375
02:15:40,215 --> 02:15:42,800
Mmm. See you, babe.

1376
02:15:47,055 --> 02:15:48,222
These are getting heavy.

1377
02:15:48,390 --> 02:15:50,224
- Buy you a lot of broads.
- I'll drink to that.

1378
02:15:52,060 --> 02:15:53,769
Come on, let's go. Move it out.

1379
02:15:54,771 --> 02:15:56,397
Come on, Babra, keep it moving.

1380
02:15:56,565 --> 02:15:58,691
We have small car full.

1381
02:15:58,859 --> 02:16:00,609
We go now.

1382
02:16:01,570 --> 02:16:03,445
Yeah. You take care of yourself now, huh?

1383
02:16:04,114 --> 02:16:05,698
Thank you.

1384
02:16:07,242 --> 02:16:09,827
Come on, we gotta get out of here.

1385
02:16:09,995 --> 02:16:12,037
Cowboy, come on.

1386
02:16:12,455 --> 02:16:14,832
Move it.
I got it, let's go.

1387
02:16:35,187 --> 02:16:37,021
Hold.

1388
02:16:38,690 --> 02:16:41,108
Eh? See? What did I tell you, huh?

1389
02:16:41,776 --> 02:16:45,571
Now look, Oddball. The trade
for the uniforms I can understand.

1390
02:16:45,739 --> 02:16:48,657
But to buy this tank, you gotta be crazy.

1391
02:16:50,035 --> 02:16:51,994
It's a mother, beautiful tank.

1392
02:16:52,162 --> 02:16:53,829
It's a piece of junk.

1393
02:16:53,997 --> 02:16:56,165
The fuel system leaks all over the place.

1394
02:16:56,333 --> 02:16:58,167
It's a piece of junk.

1395
02:17:00,587 --> 02:17:03,088
Always with the negative waves,
Moriarty.

1396
02:17:03,256 --> 02:17:06,091
Always with the negative waves.

1397
02:17:06,259 --> 02:17:07,509
Crap.

1398
02:17:33,745 --> 02:17:37,164
- Joe. Joe.
Yeah.

1399
02:17:37,332 --> 02:17:39,792
The general's on the edge of town,
right this minute.

1400
02:17:39,960 --> 02:17:42,836
Okay, Gutkowski.
You go help with the gold.

1401
02:17:44,005 --> 02:17:47,424
- Hey. Hey, hey. Hey, Fisher?
- Yeah, what do you want?

1402
02:17:48,009 --> 02:17:53,847
Listen, after splitting with Oddball and
the Germans we should have 125 boxes.

1403
02:17:54,015 --> 02:17:56,433
At $8400 a box.

1404
02:17:57,018 --> 02:17:58,185
That's how much?

1405
02:17:58,353 --> 02:18:00,980
That's 10,500,000.

1406
02:18:03,400 --> 02:18:05,985
Correct. Split 12 ways?

1407
02:18:06,403 --> 02:18:08,487
875,000 each.

1408
02:18:10,490 --> 02:18:13,367
Very good, Fisher. You win a cookie.

1409
02:18:14,202 --> 02:18:15,452
Thanks.

1410
02:18:23,878 --> 02:18:25,004
Thank you very much.

1411
02:18:25,547 --> 02:18:29,341
I just wanted you to know
that we appreciate it very much. All of us.

1412
02:18:29,509 --> 02:18:33,762
And we...
The general's coming. Eisenhower.

1413
02:18:33,930 --> 02:18:37,474
Eisenhower. That's right. Yeah.

1414
02:18:38,184 --> 02:18:41,353
You don't understand.
De Gaulle. De Gaulle.

1415
02:18:41,521 --> 02:18:43,230
De Gaulle.

1416
02:18:43,523 --> 02:18:47,568
The General de Gaulle is coming.
Right now. De Gaulle.

1417
02:18:47,736 --> 02:18:50,571
- De Gaulle. De Gaulle.
- De Gaulle.

1418
02:18:50,739 --> 02:18:52,406
- De Gaulle.
- De Gaulle.

1419
02:18:52,574 --> 02:18:54,742
De Gaulle.

1420
02:19:07,255 --> 02:19:09,548
All right, keep it moving.

1421
02:19:10,550 --> 02:19:14,345
Kelly, come on, Kelly, move it.
The cavalry's coming down the road.

1422
02:19:14,512 --> 02:19:16,263
Give us a hand.

1423
02:19:21,686 --> 02:19:25,606
- What are they saying, Maitland?
- They seem to think you' re de Gaulle.

1424
02:19:25,774 --> 02:19:28,650
De Gaulle? He ain't even in this war.

1425
02:19:28,818 --> 02:19:31,445
Hey!

1426
02:19:35,617 --> 02:19:37,951
Victory.

1427
02:19:41,539 --> 02:19:47,127
Ha-ha-ha. Cowboy, we did it.
- We got it. We did it.

1428
02:19:47,295 --> 02:19:49,463
We did it.
