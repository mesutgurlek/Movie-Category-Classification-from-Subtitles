1
00:01:20,807 --> 00:01:22,798
Get your bag off the table.
People eat there.

2
00:01:22,887 --> 00:01:24,479
They eat on plates.

3
00:01:24,567 --> 00:01:26,683
Don't give me crap, Maizy.

4
00:01:26,767 --> 00:01:28,837
I'm telling. You said ''crap.''

5
00:01:28,927 --> 00:01:32,556
- There's nothing wrong with ''crap.''
- Really? I thought that was a swear.

6
00:01:32,647 --> 00:01:35,115
- You're thinking of ''shit.''
- Right.

7
00:01:38,527 --> 00:01:40,358
Do you mind?

8
00:01:40,447 --> 00:01:43,245
A sixth-grader chased me with his bike
and I was running.

9
00:01:43,327 --> 00:01:45,921
When I got exhausted and fell down,
he waled me with his shoe.

10
00:01:46,007 --> 00:01:49,158
- Thankyour parents for that.
- How come?

11
00:01:49,247 --> 00:01:51,203
It was their brilliant idea
to move here.

12
00:01:51,287 --> 00:01:53,596
They weren't making enough cash
in Indianapolis.

13
00:01:53,687 --> 00:01:55,405
Forget that we were
perfectly happy.

14
00:01:55,487 --> 00:01:57,921
So thank them for getting treated
like shit every day.

15
00:01:58,007 --> 00:02:01,363
- I'm telling on that one.
- Shut your face.

16
00:02:06,367 --> 00:02:09,962
- Your book bag doesn't go on the floor.
- Always have a cow.

17
00:02:11,687 --> 00:02:14,326
- Your nails are digging into my arm!
- Pick it up!

18
00:02:16,367 --> 00:02:18,722
You'rejust supposed
to open the door for us.

19
00:02:18,807 --> 00:02:20,684
You're not supposed
to kick us around.

20
00:02:20,767 --> 00:02:23,201
I'm an American.
I have rights!

21
00:02:23,287 --> 00:02:25,118
Maizy, did I kickyou around?

22
00:02:25,207 --> 00:02:28,404
No, but you said ''shit'' twice.
But only once for real.

23
00:02:29,327 --> 00:02:32,364
I've got better things to do
than baby-sit you, you little stain.

24
00:02:32,447 --> 00:02:35,484
Like what, hang out with friends
you don't have?

25
00:02:35,567 --> 00:02:38,286
Why don't you just shut up?

26
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:40,278
Want to make me?

27
00:02:40,367 --> 00:02:45,316
When our mother fii gure isn't here,
I'm in charge.

28
00:02:45,407 --> 00:02:48,524
- I'm sick ofyou calling her that.
- Too bad.

29
00:02:50,807 --> 00:02:52,798
You moron!

30
00:02:52,887 --> 00:02:56,675
- Why do we need boys? They're so loud.
- Shut up!

31
00:02:56,767 --> 00:02:59,679
- Shut up yourself!
- We need boys...

32
00:02:59,767 --> 00:03:04,522
so they can grow up, get married
and turn into shadows.

33
00:03:06,967 --> 00:03:08,798
Let the dog out.

34
00:03:08,887 --> 00:03:10,286
Percy!

35
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:27,485
This is such a wonderful dinner, Mother.
How do you fii nd the time?

36
00:03:30,247 --> 00:03:31,600
Miles.

37
00:03:33,327 --> 00:03:35,477
Maizy, put that down.

38
00:03:35,567 --> 00:03:39,162
- Did you win at hockey yesterday?
- Hockey's been over for two weeks.

39
00:03:44,527 --> 00:03:48,520
I guess you don't want a hockey stick
foryour birthday.

40
00:03:53,247 --> 00:03:56,284
You know what?

41
00:03:56,367 --> 00:04:00,645
When Dad goes to New York,
I'm going to take a week off work.

42
00:04:00,727 --> 00:04:02,797
So you can interview
new housekeepers?

43
00:04:04,007 --> 00:04:07,283
- I've had enough ofyour ugliness.
- Really?

44
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:12,119
We're all a little tired ofthe act.

45
00:04:27,087 --> 00:04:29,726
- This is really a good idea.
- Thankyou.

46
00:04:30,807 --> 00:04:33,605
- How's the pie?
- Not bad.

47
00:04:34,887 --> 00:04:37,526
Will you be at work in the morning?

48
00:04:37,607 --> 00:04:39,438
I can't avoid it.

49
00:04:39,527 --> 00:04:41,518
You don't seem happy about it.

50
00:04:42,727 --> 00:04:47,198
Ifyou've got to know, I'm not excited
about working for my girlfriend.

51
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,845
There, I said it.

52
00:04:49,887 --> 00:04:51,605
Buck, I love you.

53
00:04:51,687 --> 00:04:55,566
I can't help myself. I want to get
married and have a family with you.

54
00:04:55,647 --> 00:04:57,763
The clock is ticking away.

55
00:04:57,847 --> 00:05:01,044
I would like to hear the pitter-patter
oftiny feet before I die.

56
00:05:01,127 --> 00:05:04,199
I'll get you a mouse
and a piece ofsheet metal.

57
00:05:05,967 --> 00:05:09,482
- Lighten up, will you?
- Don't push my buttons.

58
00:05:09,567 --> 00:05:11,876
I'm not pushing your buttons.
I know me.

59
00:05:11,967 --> 00:05:13,878
I know what I like.

60
00:05:13,967 --> 00:05:16,242
I like my friends, my freedom.

61
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:21,679
I like knowing I can go golfii ng
anytime I want.

62
00:05:21,767 --> 00:05:24,235
I don't hurt anybody.
I don't see what the problem is.

63
00:05:24,327 --> 00:05:26,761
That is the best formula for loneliness
I ever heard.

64
00:05:27,767 --> 00:05:30,281
- Why are we arguing?
- We're talking.

65
00:05:30,367 --> 00:05:32,562
I said I'd be at work in the morning.
I'll be there.

66
00:05:34,087 --> 00:05:35,645
Okay.

67
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,518
I've got to get this out.

68
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:44,043
I know I'm harping,
but let me say it.

69
00:05:44,127 --> 00:05:47,119
I'm working on history,
on the past.

70
00:05:47,207 --> 00:05:50,483
You're gonna show up? Swear to God?
In the a.m.? Promise?

71
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:52,876
Chanice, I'll be honest with you.

72
00:05:52,967 --> 00:05:56,357
If I could think ofan excuse
that you would buy, I'd use it.

73
00:06:11,207 --> 00:06:12,560
Hello.

74
00:06:16,567 --> 00:06:19,127
- Oh, God!
- What?

75
00:06:19,207 --> 00:06:21,562
Just a second.
It's your aunt.

76
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:23,603
What happened?

77
00:06:23,687 --> 00:06:25,757
Your dad had a heart attack.

78
00:06:29,767 --> 00:06:32,122
Who's gonna watch the kids?

79
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:35,761
Marcie.
She's right across the street.

80
00:06:35,847 --> 00:06:38,315
She's the last person
I'd ask for a favor.

81
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:42,198
What about the Nevilles?

82
00:06:44,687 --> 00:06:46,564
Would you call them?

83
00:06:46,647 --> 00:06:49,036
I want to leave as soon as we can.

84
00:06:50,807 --> 00:06:53,082
I am so helpless here.

85
00:06:53,167 --> 00:06:56,762
Don't start getting down
on why we moved.

86
00:06:56,847 --> 00:06:58,917
It has nothing to do
with what happened.

87
00:06:59,007 --> 00:07:00,406
Sorry.

88
00:07:03,127 --> 00:07:05,243
This isjust a thought.

89
00:07:05,327 --> 00:07:08,319
What about Buck?
I'm sure he'd be glad to help out.

90
00:07:08,407 --> 00:07:11,205
This is not the time
to discuss your brother.

91
00:07:11,287 --> 00:07:14,404
- I don't want him here.
- It'sjust a suggestion.

92
00:07:14,487 --> 00:07:18,446
He doesn't have kids. He isn't married.
He doesn't even work!

93
00:07:20,047 --> 00:07:24,279
He's a little out there,
but he's responsible and he's family.

94
00:07:24,367 --> 00:07:29,725
Buck is not the kind of guy
I feel comfortable leaving my kids with.

95
00:07:29,807 --> 00:07:32,321
The trashy people he hangs out with.

96
00:07:32,407 --> 00:07:35,797
That woman who sells tires.

97
00:07:35,887 --> 00:07:38,720
The horse racing, the gambling.
Can you see him in this house?

98
00:07:39,727 --> 00:07:40,716
Okay.

99
00:07:44,447 --> 00:07:46,483
Call the Nevilles.

100
00:07:50,647 --> 00:07:53,286
Are we going to Indianapolis?

101
00:07:53,367 --> 00:07:55,483
Daddy and I are.

102
00:07:55,567 --> 00:07:58,161
And we're not?

103
00:07:58,247 --> 00:08:00,283
No, that's not a good idea.

104
00:08:02,887 --> 00:08:04,798
Thanks.

105
00:08:04,887 --> 00:08:06,923
I loved my father very much.

106
00:08:07,007 --> 00:08:09,396
So why did you move away from him?

107
00:08:12,727 --> 00:08:16,402
If my family moved away from me,
I'd have a heart attack too.

108
00:08:22,767 --> 00:08:24,200
I see.

109
00:08:26,127 --> 00:08:28,880
- Who will take care of us?
- Mr. and Mrs. Neville.

110
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:31,640
- Is that a joke?
- You don't like the Nevilles?

111
00:08:31,727 --> 00:08:34,924
- The dog's a ball sniffer.
- Don't talk like that.

112
00:08:35,007 --> 00:08:38,886
Mr. Neville yelled at Michael because
their dog was sniffii ng Michael's balls.

113
00:08:38,967 --> 00:08:41,003
- Don't use that word.
- I don't know another word.

114
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:43,601
We can talk to Mr. Neville
about the dog.

115
00:08:43,687 --> 00:08:46,679
Sorry, honey.
They're in Florida.

116
00:08:49,327 --> 00:08:51,158
You get in bed.

117
00:08:51,247 --> 00:08:53,477
You have to get up for school.

118
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:56,001
- Who's in Florida?
- Get back in bed.

119
00:08:56,087 --> 00:08:58,965
- What's the other word for balls?
- Get in bed.

120
00:09:01,487 --> 00:09:02,966
Nuts.

121
00:09:06,247 --> 00:09:08,317
What do we do?

122
00:09:08,407 --> 00:09:10,477
I don't think we have much choice.

123
00:09:12,327 --> 00:09:13,680
Can we trust him?

124
00:09:16,447 --> 00:09:17,562
Yeah?

125
00:09:17,647 --> 00:09:19,717
Buck, this is Bob.

126
00:09:19,807 --> 00:09:22,640
Bob? Bob who?

127
00:09:25,447 --> 00:09:27,438
It's your brother.

128
00:09:28,647 --> 00:09:32,242
Bobby!
Hang on a minute.

129
00:09:52,487 --> 00:09:55,001
Just used your Christmas present.

130
00:09:55,087 --> 00:09:57,317
The Clapper.

131
00:09:57,407 --> 00:10:00,683
You little pissant, how you doing?

132
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,644
Geez! Are you drunk?

133
00:10:04,167 --> 00:10:05,520
You knowsomething?

134
00:10:05,607 --> 00:10:09,361
We gotta get together. I haven't been
overyour house since you moved in.

135
00:10:09,447 --> 00:10:13,918
I'm sorry about those bushes too.
Ihadno idea...

136
00:10:14,007 --> 00:10:16,885
that they would catch on fii re like that.

137
00:10:16,967 --> 00:10:19,686
You were right. I should never
have put the barbecue that close.

138
00:10:19,767 --> 00:10:22,918
Cindy's father
had a heart attack tonight.

139
00:10:23,007 --> 00:10:26,363
We'dIike toget to IndianapoIis
assoon aspossibIe.

140
00:10:26,447 --> 00:10:29,200
But we have a problem
with the kids.

141
00:10:29,287 --> 00:10:33,280
We're stuck for somebody to watch them.
Ifyou're not doing anything--

142
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:36,245
Is this okay with Cindy?
It's got Cindy's approval?

143
00:10:36,967 --> 00:10:38,320
Oh, yeah.

144
00:10:38,407 --> 00:10:41,922
That'd be great. I'd be honored.

145
00:10:42,007 --> 00:10:45,363
I've still got the one bedroom.
I'm going to get a bigger place.

146
00:10:45,447 --> 00:10:48,086
But they can bring their sleeping bags.
We'll have fun.

147
00:10:48,167 --> 00:10:50,840
We'll make tents.
Get some toys and peanut butter.

148
00:10:50,927 --> 00:10:53,646
- We'IIhave a bIast.
- I thought you could come here.

149
00:10:53,727 --> 00:10:55,638
The kids have school.

150
00:10:55,727 --> 00:10:57,763
What am Ithinking?Sure.

151
00:10:57,847 --> 00:10:59,883
Tonight or in the morning?

152
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:02,037
Tonight would be best
ifyou could do it.

153
00:11:02,127 --> 00:11:05,676
Tonight will be fii ne.
Don't worry.

154
00:11:05,767 --> 00:11:07,758
I'll pack a few things
and I'm on my way.

155
00:11:07,847 --> 00:11:10,042
Thanks. See you soon.

156
00:11:11,927 --> 00:11:15,806
He can do it.
He was asleep and I woke him up.

157
00:11:17,527 --> 00:11:21,315
At this hour, that's a good sign.
We're all set.

158
00:11:29,247 --> 00:11:31,681
Okay, this, this and this.

159
00:11:35,727 --> 00:11:37,638
Bag, bag, bag.

160
00:11:39,447 --> 00:11:41,278
This will do.

161
00:11:51,967 --> 00:11:53,161
Hello.

162
00:11:53,247 --> 00:11:55,124
Chanice, honey?

163
00:11:56,567 --> 00:11:58,444
I have bad news.

164
00:11:58,527 --> 00:12:00,563
Let me guess.

165
00:12:00,647 --> 00:12:02,797
You are not coming in to work
in the morning.

166
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,404
Just let--

167
00:12:09,567 --> 00:12:11,523
No, but-- You don't--

168
00:12:11,607 --> 00:12:14,565
Would you just--
Give me--

169
00:12:14,647 --> 00:12:17,081
Let me get--

170
00:12:17,167 --> 00:12:19,317
You're not-- Give me a--

171
00:12:20,327 --> 00:12:21,726
Good-bye.

172
00:12:24,727 --> 00:12:27,639
Boy, I haven't seen those kids
in a while.

173
00:12:29,287 --> 00:12:31,642
Tia's got to be nine.

174
00:12:31,727 --> 00:12:34,560
Nine, maybe ten.
Oh, boy.

175
00:12:34,647 --> 00:12:37,684
And the two new ones.
They're--

176
00:12:37,767 --> 00:12:39,485
Larry and--

177
00:12:40,847 --> 00:12:42,200
Larry and...

178
00:12:44,567 --> 00:12:45,920
Betsy.

179
00:12:46,007 --> 00:12:47,406
Betsy--

180
00:12:48,807 --> 00:12:50,923
Jennifer.

181
00:12:51,007 --> 00:12:53,123
Larry and Jennifer.
Nice kids.

182
00:12:58,207 --> 00:13:02,883
Honey, he's 40 years old.
He knows his way around.

183
00:13:02,967 --> 00:13:08,087
Why don't you fii nish packing?
I'll watch out for Buck.

184
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:31,480
What the hell?

185
00:13:31,567 --> 00:13:33,398
Where is everybody?

186
00:13:40,847 --> 00:13:42,200
Bob?

187
00:13:45,767 --> 00:13:48,759
This isn't funny.
Come on. Wake up!

188
00:13:48,847 --> 00:13:52,806
- I'm freezing my ass off out here.
- Oh, shit!

189
00:13:52,887 --> 00:13:55,276
I'm getting mad, Bob.

190
00:13:57,847 --> 00:13:58,996
Buck?

191
00:14:02,767 --> 00:14:04,200
Over here!

192
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:15,721
Do you know how many big white houses
there are on this street?

193
00:14:17,207 --> 00:14:18,560
What?

194
00:14:18,647 --> 00:14:21,081
- Keep it down.
- What?

195
00:14:21,167 --> 00:14:24,557
- What should I do with my car?
- For crying out loud!

196
00:14:24,647 --> 00:14:26,126
Sorry, Mr. Hatfiield.

197
00:14:26,207 --> 00:14:28,243
It's 2:00 a.m.!

198
00:14:28,327 --> 00:14:30,795
How you doing?
Sorry I'm late.

199
00:14:30,887 --> 00:14:34,084
- No. Thanks for coming.
- What happened to the mustache?

200
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:36,362
- Had to shave it off.
- How's Cindy?

201
00:14:36,447 --> 00:14:38,324
- Not well.
- Her dad?

202
00:14:38,407 --> 00:14:41,558
- Hard to say.
- Those medical terms. An infarction?

203
00:14:50,167 --> 00:14:53,955
I stopped smoking cigarettes.
Isn't that something?

204
00:14:55,047 --> 00:14:57,880
I'm on to cigars.
I'm on a fiive-year plan.

205
00:14:57,967 --> 00:15:01,004
I eliminated cigarettes,
then I go to cigars, then to pipes...

206
00:15:01,087 --> 00:15:03,442
then to chewing tobacco,
then the nicotine gum.

207
00:15:04,407 --> 00:15:05,760
Good.

208
00:15:07,287 --> 00:15:08,879
Money.

209
00:15:08,967 --> 00:15:12,562
- I'll leave you blank checks.
- No, I've got lots of money.

210
00:15:14,167 --> 00:15:16,397
No, please.

211
00:15:16,487 --> 00:15:18,523
I've got the money.
I'd like to do this.

212
00:15:18,607 --> 00:15:20,996
All right?
Come on, please.

213
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,681
I'll pay you back when we get home.

214
00:15:27,167 --> 00:15:29,556
I won't have any problem cashing...

215
00:15:29,647 --> 00:15:32,241
a second-party
out-of-state paycheck, will I?

216
00:15:32,327 --> 00:15:37,242
I've been so busy,
I haven't been able to do my banking.

217
00:15:37,327 --> 00:15:39,841
- I don't think there'll be a problem.
- Let me leave you the checks.

218
00:15:39,927 --> 00:15:42,441
- Only if it's comfortable foryou.
- That'll be easier.

219
00:15:42,527 --> 00:15:44,916
I guess.
Do you have a plunger?

220
00:15:45,007 --> 00:15:48,841
While I'm thinking ofthese things.
For the morning.

221
00:15:48,927 --> 00:15:51,316
My plumbing is bad.
Ofcourse, yours is good.

222
00:15:51,407 --> 00:15:54,001
I would imagine.
Don't worry about it.

223
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:56,760
Everything will be fii ne.
I've been bound up lately.

224
00:15:56,847 --> 00:16:00,157
It's driving me crazy. I've been eating
a lot ofcheese for some reason.

225
00:16:00,247 --> 00:16:03,922
I got a craving for the stuff.
Do you think maybe that's an allergy?

226
00:16:05,367 --> 00:16:06,766
Yeah.

227
00:16:06,847 --> 00:16:10,965
I don't know, I can't get enough cheese.
I feel like a big mouse.

228
00:16:11,927 --> 00:16:14,202
- I don't know.
- Oh, well.

229
00:16:14,287 --> 00:16:18,405
Let's see.
Oh, Miles' birthday.

230
00:16:18,487 --> 00:16:21,047
We'll be back by that time.

231
00:16:21,127 --> 00:16:23,243
Okay, then.
This should do.

232
00:16:23,327 --> 00:16:26,876
I probably won't use them.
Just in case.

233
00:16:26,967 --> 00:16:29,197
- Right.
- Great. Okay.

234
00:16:38,167 --> 00:16:40,840
I know I've forgotten something.
What else?

235
00:16:40,927 --> 00:16:44,966
All right? That looks nice.
Give me your arm.

236
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:48,756
It should only be a few days.
I promise I'll call you tomorrow.

237
00:16:48,847 --> 00:16:51,042
- You've got all the phone numbers?
- Yeah.

238
00:16:51,127 --> 00:16:54,324
- We're off. Thanks, Buck.
- Take care ofyourself.

239
00:16:54,407 --> 00:16:57,444
- We appreciate this.
- Thanks. Thankyou.

240
00:16:57,527 --> 00:17:01,042
- Say hi to your dad. Drive safely.
- You can do it.

241
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,646
That's for sure.

242
00:17:41,447 --> 00:17:42,800
Unbreakable.

243
00:17:49,247 --> 00:17:51,158
Shit!

244
00:17:52,527 --> 00:17:54,358
It's 7.:02 in the a.m.

245
00:17:54,447 --> 00:17:56,642
You're listening to
W-I-Don't-Have-To-Go-To-Work-Today...

246
00:17:56,727 --> 00:17:58,558
brought to you by
Kobolowski Tires.

247
00:17:58,647 --> 00:18:00,877
For the best in tires,
see Chanice Kobolowski.

248
00:18:30,687 --> 00:18:32,086
Tia!

249
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:37,841
You remember me?

250
00:18:41,127 --> 00:18:43,118
Uncle Buck.

251
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:45,038
The Uncle Buck.

252
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:55,123
Coffee drinker, huh?

253
00:19:09,847 --> 00:19:12,361
- Hungry?
- No.

254
00:19:12,447 --> 00:19:16,042
Sure you are. Everybody loves breakfast.
You gotta have a good breakfast.

255
00:19:16,127 --> 00:19:18,766
Start the day off right.

256
00:19:22,367 --> 00:19:25,598
- So where are the other ones?
- Other ones what?

257
00:19:25,687 --> 00:19:28,281
The other kids.

258
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:31,723
They have names.
Miles and Maizy.

259
00:19:31,807 --> 00:19:33,684
Are Miles and Maizy up yet?

260
00:19:33,767 --> 00:19:35,598
I woke them, thankyou.

261
00:19:39,367 --> 00:19:40,720
There you go.

262
00:19:40,807 --> 00:19:42,843
Are you deaf?
I said I wasn't hungry.

263
00:19:42,927 --> 00:19:44,758
That's one of my specialties.

264
00:19:49,287 --> 00:19:50,800
I'd rather starve.

265
00:19:50,887 --> 00:19:52,878
Does your mom know
you drink coffee?

266
00:19:53,807 --> 00:19:56,799
I'm not doing it to impress you.

267
00:19:56,887 --> 00:19:58,798
I appreciate that.

268
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,921
Is there a reason why
you're giving me a hard time?

269
00:20:04,727 --> 00:20:07,560
Am I giving you a hard time?

270
00:20:07,647 --> 00:20:10,923
Well, I don't know.

271
00:20:11,007 --> 00:20:13,282
- How you doin'?
- Who are you?

272
00:20:13,367 --> 00:20:14,959
I'm your Uncle Buck.

273
00:20:15,767 --> 00:20:17,997
- Do I have an uncle?
- Unfortunately.

274
00:20:19,487 --> 00:20:20,840
Holy smokes!

275
00:20:20,927 --> 00:20:23,077
He's cooking our garbage.

276
00:20:29,447 --> 00:20:31,722
Where's your sister--

277
00:20:31,807 --> 00:20:35,163
Her name is Maizy,
for the second time.

278
00:20:36,407 --> 00:20:38,796
Sorry.

279
00:20:40,007 --> 00:20:42,282
You must be hungry.

280
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,642
Just foryou.

281
00:20:44,727 --> 00:20:48,640
Oh, my God!
He put onions in the eggs.

282
00:20:48,727 --> 00:20:50,445
I'm gonna check on Maizy.

283
00:20:50,527 --> 00:20:53,678
I'll fiix you cereal when I get back.

284
00:21:09,487 --> 00:21:11,603
- Can I askyou something?
- What?

285
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:14,478
Is she always this pleasant?

286
00:21:14,567 --> 00:21:17,559
No, she's usually in a bad mood
in the morning.

287
00:21:21,127 --> 00:21:24,358
Do you want knots in your hair?
Cut it out.

288
00:21:24,447 --> 00:21:27,280
- I want Mom to do it.
- Mom's not here.

289
00:21:27,367 --> 00:21:29,198
- She is too.
- No, she's not.

290
00:21:29,287 --> 00:21:32,484
- She and Dad went to Indianapolis.
- They did not.

291
00:21:32,567 --> 00:21:34,922
- Okay, they didn't.
- They did?

292
00:21:35,007 --> 00:21:37,680
Yes. And I'm taking care ofyou.

293
00:21:37,767 --> 00:21:40,201
But you can't drive.

294
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:43,359
- Where do you live?
- In the city.

295
00:21:43,447 --> 00:21:44,960
- Do you own a house?
- Apartment. Rent.

296
00:21:45,047 --> 00:21:47,197
- What do you do for a living?
- Lots ofthings.

297
00:21:47,287 --> 00:21:49,847
- Where's your offiice?
- I don't have one. I don't need one.

298
00:21:49,927 --> 00:21:52,600
- Where's your wife?
- Don't have one. It's a long story.

299
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:55,679
- Do you have kids?
- I don't. It's an even longer story.

300
00:21:55,767 --> 00:21:58,406
-Are you my dad's brother?
-What's your record for questions asked?

301
00:21:58,487 --> 00:22:01,047
- Thirty-eight.
- I'm your dad's brother.

302
00:22:01,127 --> 00:22:03,277
You have more nose hair than my dad.

303
00:22:03,367 --> 00:22:05,676
- Nice ofyou to notice.
- I'm a kid. That's myjob.

304
00:22:38,287 --> 00:22:41,165
That is my car.

305
00:23:00,687 --> 00:23:02,917
Tying your shoe?

306
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:13,160
- What time should I pickyou up?
- Don't bother. I'll get a ride.

307
00:23:13,247 --> 00:23:15,238
No, I've got orders.
What time?

308
00:23:16,247 --> 00:23:18,715
Are you really this stupid?
I said I would get a ride.

309
00:23:18,807 --> 00:23:20,399
I always get a ride.

310
00:23:20,487 --> 00:23:23,445
I'll call the school,
fii nd out what time and meet you here.

311
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:26,678
Go ahead, call the school.
I won't be here.

312
00:23:26,767 --> 00:23:30,043
Stand me up today,
and tomorrow...

313
00:23:30,127 --> 00:23:34,166
I'll drive you to school in my pajamas
and walkyou to your fii rst class.

314
00:23:35,087 --> 00:23:39,444
- 4:00 okay?
- I'm stunned I'm related to you.

315
00:23:40,567 --> 00:23:43,240
You get the pole out ofyour keister,
we'll get along fii ne.

316
00:23:46,087 --> 00:23:48,726
Did you ever have anyone
embarrass you like this?

317
00:23:57,167 --> 00:23:59,283
No.

318
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:18,404
- You think she hates me?
- With a passion.

319
00:24:18,487 --> 00:24:21,399
- Is it the hat?
- No.

320
00:24:21,487 --> 00:24:26,402
A lot of people hate this hat.
The sight of it angers people.

321
00:24:26,487 --> 00:24:29,638
I'll tell you a story about that
on the way to school.

322
00:24:34,007 --> 00:24:35,838
Right. Listen, Buck.

323
00:24:35,927 --> 00:24:39,636
For eight years you have been
making plans and breaking plans.

324
00:24:39,727 --> 00:24:41,718
What are you talking about?

325
00:24:41,807 --> 00:24:45,595
Didn't we talk last night about this?

326
00:24:45,687 --> 00:24:48,520
What did we talk about?
Me playing the father!

327
00:24:48,607 --> 00:24:52,725
I'm glad you can do it foryour brother.
You sure can't do it for me.

328
00:24:52,807 --> 00:24:55,321
How could I do it foryou?
We don't have kids.

329
00:24:55,407 --> 00:24:57,443
What areyou taIking about?

330
00:24:57,527 --> 00:25:00,997
Buck, I know you think thejob
is pointless...

331
00:25:01,087 --> 00:25:04,363
and in some way I'm trying
to manipulate you and control you...

332
00:25:04,447 --> 00:25:07,325
andruinyourIife.

333
00:25:07,407 --> 00:25:11,878
I have to fii ll the position.
It's important to the company and me.

334
00:25:11,967 --> 00:25:15,198
Unless you tell me different,
I'll offer thejob to somebody else.

335
00:25:15,287 --> 00:25:20,042
Give me a week to think about it.
I don't know how long I'll be here.

336
00:25:20,127 --> 00:25:23,199
If, during that week...

337
00:25:23,287 --> 00:25:25,960
you see somebody
who will fii ll the bill...

338
00:25:26,047 --> 00:25:28,766
hire him on a part-time basis
or whatever.

339
00:25:28,847 --> 00:25:33,284
That way I'll make up my mind and
we'll see where we are at that point.

340
00:25:33,367 --> 00:25:35,642
Okay, I have to go now.

341
00:25:35,727 --> 00:25:37,718
Bye-bye, hon.

342
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:50,322
Eight more. Come on.

343
00:25:50,407 --> 00:25:52,557
Work it.
Get the circuIationgoing.

344
00:25:52,647 --> 00:25:54,478
Step it up.

345
00:25:55,407 --> 00:25:57,079
Isn 'tpeace wonderfuI?

346
00:25:57,167 --> 00:26:01,718
MikhaiI Gorbachev, the most improbabIe

captivates Manhattan...

348

wows the U.N. by announcing a uniIateraI
cut in theSoviet miIitary...

351
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:30,518
Take that, KarIMax.

352
00:26:59,807 --> 00:27:02,480
Would you like to talk about
a possible lunch trade?

353
00:27:49,727 --> 00:27:51,922
Coveryour ears.
Just do it.

354
00:27:58,407 --> 00:28:01,843
Do you know how whipped
an engine has to be to blow that loud?

355
00:28:10,007 --> 00:28:11,918
Call me.

356
00:28:13,407 --> 00:28:16,444
You ever hear ofa tune-up?

357
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:21,200
You ever hear ofa ritual killing?

358
00:28:22,407 --> 00:28:23,760
I don't get it.

359
00:28:23,847 --> 00:28:26,520
Gnaw on her face in public
like that again and you'll be one.

360
00:28:37,567 --> 00:28:39,922
- Are you crazy?
- I can be.

361
00:28:40,007 --> 00:28:42,567
- You could've taken his head off.
- But would he notice?

362
00:28:42,647 --> 00:28:44,956
Can we get something straight?

363
00:28:45,047 --> 00:28:47,277
The guy's a predator
and you're his prey.

364
00:28:47,367 --> 00:28:49,005
- Really?
- You bet.

365
00:28:49,087 --> 00:28:51,681
- How do you know?
- When I was his age, I was the guy...

366
00:28:51,767 --> 00:28:54,565
zooming the girls like you.

367
00:28:54,647 --> 00:28:56,365
Pretty face, big chip on your shoulder.

368
00:28:56,447 --> 00:28:59,086
I recommend you stay out
of my personal life.

369
00:28:59,967 --> 00:29:01,798
Do your parents stay out
ofyour personal lie?

370
00:29:01,887 --> 00:29:04,845
They don't know my personal life.

371
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:09,956
- Have they met Twiddle Dink?
- His name is Bug.

372
00:29:12,487 --> 00:29:14,557
- First or last?
- First.

373
00:29:14,647 --> 00:29:17,366
What's his last name, Spray?

374
00:29:19,927 --> 00:29:22,202
You should talk, Buck.

375
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:41,563
No. No.

376
00:29:41,647 --> 00:29:45,242
N-O. Don't look at me like that.

377
00:29:46,287 --> 00:29:48,164
Don't!

378
00:29:48,247 --> 00:29:50,283
That's not fair.

379
00:29:55,367 --> 00:29:59,042
Don't you have a favorite doll
or something?

380
00:29:59,127 --> 00:30:02,597
Why don't we get your doll
and put your dad's pajamas on him?

381
00:30:09,247 --> 00:30:11,807
Your brother!
What about your brother?

382
00:30:13,087 --> 00:30:14,964
How about the dog?
You know the dog.

383
00:30:20,767 --> 00:30:22,917
You can't.
You just can't.

384
00:30:24,407 --> 00:30:26,602
It's a new law.
That's it.

385
00:30:26,687 --> 00:30:28,723
It's in the books.

386
00:30:30,007 --> 00:30:31,884
You don't want to sleep with me.

387
00:30:32,887 --> 00:30:35,879
Can somebody get that, please?

388
00:30:37,367 --> 00:30:40,484
Do I have to do everything
around here?

389
00:30:45,047 --> 00:30:47,925
- Yo.
- Hi, sweetie. Howareyou?

390
00:30:48,007 --> 00:30:52,000
Fine. I'm earning my keep.
Uncle Buck's got me bustin' my hump.

391
00:30:52,087 --> 00:30:54,840
Hesays hard work
wiIIput hair on my chest.

392
00:30:54,927 --> 00:30:56,599
At Ieast I'm Iearning a trade.

393
00:30:56,687 --> 00:31:00,157
That's good.
Grandpa's feeling better.

394
00:31:00,247 --> 00:31:03,319
Hesendsyou
big hugs andkisses.

395
00:31:03,407 --> 00:31:04,999
Tell him to hang in there.

396
00:31:06,207 --> 00:31:09,722
- Can you get Uncle Buck?
- Will do, chickie.

397
00:31:09,807 --> 00:31:11,206
Mom?

398
00:31:11,287 --> 00:31:13,596
- Hi.
- Next timeyou take off...

399
00:31:13,687 --> 00:31:16,247
why don't you hire a murderer
to watch the house?

400
00:31:16,327 --> 00:31:18,841
Thisguy's ajoke.

401
00:31:18,927 --> 00:31:22,363
Why don't you go your way
and let him go his?

402
00:31:23,327 --> 00:31:25,636
While he systematically
dismantles my life?

403
00:31:25,727 --> 00:31:28,764
Another drawback is
that I'm a big drooler.

404
00:31:28,847 --> 00:31:32,044
You could wake up
thinking you were asleep in a swamp.

405
00:31:32,127 --> 00:31:34,800
- Mom's on the phone.
- Good. I'll be right there.

406
00:31:34,887 --> 00:31:37,799
The guy took off
and left Miles and Maizy alone.

407
00:31:39,367 --> 00:31:42,165
Plus he drinks.

408
00:31:42,247 --> 00:31:45,364
- Did you brush your teeth?
- Yeah. Feel my toothbrush.

409
00:31:45,447 --> 00:31:49,599
I have a friend who works at
the crime lab at the police station.

410
00:31:49,687 --> 00:31:52,645
I could give him your toothbrush
and he could run a test on it to see...

411
00:31:52,727 --> 00:31:56,481
ifyou actually brushed your teeth
or ran your toothbrush under the faucet.

412
00:32:04,487 --> 00:32:08,560
Ifthat's true, we're going to really
have to start brushing our teeth.

413
00:32:09,887 --> 00:32:11,206
How are you?

414
00:32:11,287 --> 00:32:14,723
- I'm okay. How's everything?
- Good, good.

415
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:17,446
- Yousure?
- Everything is fine here.

416
00:32:17,527 --> 00:32:19,995
- Everything's fine.
- Kids are okay?

417
00:32:20,087 --> 00:32:22,999
The kids are great!
We're having a great time together.

418
00:32:23,087 --> 00:32:24,645
How'syourdad?

419
00:32:24,727 --> 00:32:27,195
He's okay.
He's getting better. Thanks.

420
00:32:27,287 --> 00:32:29,357
That'sgoodnews.
That's encouraging.

421
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:31,563
I've got agoodfeeIing about this.
He'sgonna be fine.

422
00:32:31,647 --> 00:32:33,717
I got a few questions foryou.

423
00:32:33,807 --> 00:32:37,197
Yougot an interesting set ofpIates
in the Iiving room.

424
00:32:37,287 --> 00:32:38,800
-Are they oId?
- Yeah.

425
00:32:38,887 --> 00:32:40,240
They are.

426
00:32:41,367 --> 00:32:43,358
Where would you fii nd
something like that?

427
00:32:43,447 --> 00:32:45,677
In an antique shop downtown?

428
00:32:47,407 --> 00:32:48,760
In England.

429
00:32:55,687 --> 00:32:58,076
How many times a day
do you feed a dog like that?

430
00:32:58,167 --> 00:33:02,558
How many times a day
do you think he eats?

431
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,126
Four or fiive.

432
00:33:04,207 --> 00:33:07,040
He eats once a day.

433
00:33:07,127 --> 00:33:09,482
Just once.

434
00:33:09,567 --> 00:33:12,684
What does he Iike to drink?
Water?

435
00:33:12,767 --> 00:33:16,157
Yes, he drinks water.
I would keep water out.

436
00:33:16,247 --> 00:33:19,205
I've been leaving the toilet seats up.

437
00:33:19,287 --> 00:33:21,118
Yeah.

438
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:23,163
The blue water's not good for him?

439
00:33:25,327 --> 00:33:27,636
That might account for something.

440
00:33:27,727 --> 00:33:29,843
Nothing.

441
00:33:29,927 --> 00:33:32,885
Just an odd coloration
out on the grass.

442
00:33:33,687 --> 00:33:35,086
Buck...

443
00:33:37,127 --> 00:33:40,597
I want you to know it makes me
feel secure to know you're there.

444
00:33:43,927 --> 00:33:45,280
Thankyou very much.

445
00:33:45,367 --> 00:33:47,278
Okay, bye-bye.

446
00:33:53,727 --> 00:33:55,126
Bob?

447
00:35:26,287 --> 00:35:27,640
Cindy?

448
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:38,125
Open up.

449
00:35:40,647 --> 00:35:42,000
Hello?

450
00:35:50,367 --> 00:35:52,358
I'm getting mad.
All right.

451
00:35:52,447 --> 00:35:54,677
Get ready.
Here I come.

452
00:35:54,767 --> 00:35:58,282
Come on! Do I have
to talk dirty to you?

453
00:35:58,367 --> 00:36:00,676
Open up for daddy.

454
00:36:00,767 --> 00:36:02,598
There we go.

455
00:36:02,687 --> 00:36:05,076
Nice and easy.

456
00:36:05,167 --> 00:36:07,761
Come on, here we go.
Take that!

457
00:36:07,847 --> 00:36:09,758
You don't want the crowbar, do you?
Come on!

458
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:12,480
Open up!

459
00:36:12,567 --> 00:36:13,920
Come on!

460
00:36:14,007 --> 00:36:16,805
I'm gonna shove my load into you
whetheryou like it or not.

461
00:36:16,887 --> 00:36:18,400
Come on!

462
00:36:18,487 --> 00:36:21,763
Come on, you son ofa bitch,
open up.

463
00:36:40,607 --> 00:36:42,882
- Freeze!
- Who are you?

464
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:45,435
- Cindy!
- She's in Indianapolis.

465
00:36:45,527 --> 00:36:49,042
- What's she doing in Indianapolis?
- Her father had a heart attack.

466
00:36:49,127 --> 00:36:52,199
Who are you, and how do you know
her father had a heart attack?

467
00:36:52,287 --> 00:36:53,845
I'm her brother-in-law.

468
00:36:53,927 --> 00:36:56,680
Yeah? Who you talking dirty to?

469
00:36:58,807 --> 00:37:00,160
The washing machine.

470
00:37:00,247 --> 00:37:03,523
I don't know how to work it, so I was
kicking it and swearing at it...

471
00:37:03,607 --> 00:37:06,963
which is not
an uncommon thing to do.

472
00:37:07,047 --> 00:37:08,878
And you thought--

473
00:37:10,007 --> 00:37:12,362
- I apologize.
- Okay.

474
00:37:14,287 --> 00:37:16,084
Boy, that's funny.

475
00:37:17,687 --> 00:37:19,803
I live across the street.

476
00:37:19,887 --> 00:37:22,685
- My name is Marcie.
- Buck Russell.

477
00:37:23,887 --> 00:37:25,240
Marcie Dahlgren-Frost.

478
00:37:25,327 --> 00:37:28,125
Dahlgren is my maiden name.
Frost is my married name.

479
00:37:28,207 --> 00:37:31,279
I'm single again,
but I never bothered to lose the Frost.

480
00:37:32,847 --> 00:37:36,601
- I get compliments on the hyphen.
- I'm sure you would.

481
00:37:37,727 --> 00:37:39,797
I came to invite Cindy to lunch...

482
00:37:39,887 --> 00:37:42,560
but since she's not here,
do you have plans?

483
00:37:42,647 --> 00:37:45,878
I've got a lot ofthings to do
around here.

484
00:37:45,967 --> 00:37:47,241
Rain check?

485
00:37:48,527 --> 00:37:50,358
I'm only gonna be here
a couple days.

486
00:37:50,447 --> 00:37:52,802
Cindy said it would only be
a couple ofdays?

487
00:37:52,887 --> 00:37:55,162
She didn't specify.
I just assumed.

488
00:37:55,247 --> 00:37:57,886
My father's heart attack,
I was out oftown three weeks.

489
00:37:57,967 --> 00:38:00,356
No wonder Cindy didn't call me.

490
00:38:00,447 --> 00:38:04,281
You need a relative
for an imposition ofthis size.

491
00:38:13,047 --> 00:38:14,799
Waiting foryour sex?

492
00:38:14,887 --> 00:38:16,445
Shut up!

493
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:18,119
Tia?

494
00:38:22,647 --> 00:38:25,002
Why'd you blow all that makeup?
We'rejust going bowling.

495
00:38:26,207 --> 00:38:27,720
I'm not going bowling.

496
00:38:27,807 --> 00:38:31,402
It's a great sport, and it's impossible
to get pregnant while doing it...

497
00:38:31,487 --> 00:38:33,318
ifyou catch my drift.

498
00:38:33,407 --> 00:38:37,798
You're disgusting.
I'll die before I go anywhere with you.

499
00:38:37,887 --> 00:38:40,526
- It's going to be fun.
- They have rent-a-shoes.

500
00:38:40,607 --> 00:38:42,677
And rent-a-foot-disease.

501
00:38:42,767 --> 00:38:46,316
We've done the battle ofthe wills.
The deck's stacked in my favor.

502
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,398
You'll lose again.

503
00:38:48,487 --> 00:38:49,840
Try me.

504
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:52,964
How'd you like to spend
the next few nights wondering...

505
00:38:53,047 --> 00:38:55,242
ifyour crazy, out-of-work bum uncle...

506
00:38:55,327 --> 00:38:58,399
will shave your head
while you sleep?

507
00:38:58,487 --> 00:39:00,842
See you in the car.

508
00:39:34,927 --> 00:39:37,043
Come on up.

509
00:39:38,247 --> 00:39:40,715
There you go.
This is a bowling ball.

510
00:40:14,167 --> 00:40:17,398
How you doing?
Never seen you here before.

511
00:40:17,487 --> 00:40:21,366
I know about everybody.
That's why they call me ''Pal.''

512
00:40:22,407 --> 00:40:26,320
Buy you a beer?
You must be a college student.

513
00:40:27,447 --> 00:40:29,722
Cheerleader probably.

514
00:40:31,007 --> 00:40:32,998
You look fii rm.

515
00:40:33,087 --> 00:40:35,601
Give it a push.
That's it.

516
00:40:35,687 --> 00:40:39,043
You like all-terrain vehicles?

517
00:40:39,127 --> 00:40:44,247
I've got a brand-new Bronco
right out in the parking lot. Red.

518
00:40:44,327 --> 00:40:46,318
Want to go for a ride?

519
00:40:50,927 --> 00:40:53,316
Ifthe object ofthe game were
to get the ball as close to the pins...

520
00:40:53,407 --> 00:40:55,477
without knocking any ofthem over...

521
00:40:55,567 --> 00:40:57,922
you would be champion ofthe world.

522
00:40:58,007 --> 00:40:59,998
- Really?
- Really.

523
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:09,562
My throat hurts.
I can't talk.

524
00:41:09,647 --> 00:41:11,797
I've got a cure for that.

525
00:41:18,367 --> 00:41:20,358
You got a game going?

526
00:41:20,447 --> 00:41:24,042
You're not going to get any strikes
sitting there, are you? Move it!

527
00:41:24,127 --> 00:41:25,526
Get out!

528
00:41:28,327 --> 00:41:30,921
Shithead, where the hell you been?

529
00:41:36,287 --> 00:41:38,482
Sit down.
I want you to meet my niece.

530
00:41:38,567 --> 00:41:40,364
Tia, this is Rog.
Rog, Tia.

531
00:41:40,447 --> 00:41:44,565
How are you?
E. Roger Coswell.

532
00:41:44,647 --> 00:41:47,798
Come on, it ain't gonna bite.

533
00:41:49,047 --> 00:41:52,039
Okay. You've got to let
somebody know where you are.

534
00:41:52,127 --> 00:41:54,516
I've been checking car trunks
foryour corpse.

535
00:41:54,607 --> 00:41:59,078
I'm sorry. I've been in the suburbs
watching my brother's kids a few days.

536
00:41:59,167 --> 00:42:00,759
They're cuties.

537
00:42:00,847 --> 00:42:03,566
Art Linkletter was right. Kids do say
the goddamnedest things.

538
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:05,046
Is Chanice here?

539
00:42:06,167 --> 00:42:08,078
I'm flying solo tonight.

540
00:42:08,167 --> 00:42:09,998
I want to let her have it
for not marrying you.

541
00:42:10,087 --> 00:42:13,796
Ifshe'd marry your worthless butt,
I would be able to fii nd you.

542
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:16,481
I gotta talk business.
I can't fii nd you.

543
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:19,365
Why don't we step
into my offiice then?

544
00:42:19,447 --> 00:42:22,280
Excuse us.
Come on, big mouth.

545
00:42:22,367 --> 00:42:25,837
- It was nice meeting you.
- I'll remember it always.

546
00:42:28,847 --> 00:42:30,200
Cute kid.

547
00:42:31,207 --> 00:42:34,483
-Jimmy Bean called.
- Yeah?

548
00:42:34,567 --> 00:42:37,604
He's coming in for the Winter Million
at Burlington Park on Friday.

549
00:42:37,687 --> 00:42:42,044
He says it's a boat race,
very easy money. He owes you and me.

550
00:42:42,127 --> 00:42:46,439
He says to show up an hour before
post time and he'll give us the tip.

551
00:42:46,527 --> 00:42:50,281
Consider this, Buck. With this score,
your whole year's covered.

552
00:42:55,207 --> 00:42:57,038
Maybe I can make it work.

553
00:42:58,047 --> 00:42:59,878
I'll see you Friday night.

554
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:01,400
Thanks, Rog.

555
00:43:01,487 --> 00:43:03,557
Watch the Sterno, will you?

556
00:43:08,487 --> 00:43:10,125
Watch your fii ngers.

557
00:43:14,007 --> 00:43:16,316
What's a ''Chanice''?

558
00:43:16,407 --> 00:43:18,796
That's someone who's sometimes seen
around a Buck.

559
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:21,003
Your girlfriend?

560
00:43:21,087 --> 00:43:23,601
A friend.
And, yes, she is a girl.

561
00:43:23,687 --> 00:43:25,484
Are you supposed to marry her?

562
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:29,162
The subject has come up,
but nothing serious.

563
00:43:29,247 --> 00:43:32,284
Maybe ifyou got married,
you'd stop being such an asshole.

564
00:43:37,447 --> 00:43:40,484
- Cigar?
- No, thanks.

565
00:43:40,567 --> 00:43:42,922
- Let me know ifyou change your mind.
- I will.

566
00:43:44,407 --> 00:43:46,796
I'll get it nice and juicy foryou.

567
00:43:55,247 --> 00:44:00,002
This is where you separate
the men from the boys.

568
00:44:01,927 --> 00:44:03,360
Easy. Easy.

569
00:44:03,447 --> 00:44:07,281
There you go.
Yeah, I got you now.

570
00:44:18,007 --> 00:44:20,282
Happy birthday!

571
00:44:23,007 --> 00:44:25,601
I hope you're hungry.

572
00:44:25,687 --> 00:44:29,236
You should see the toast.
I couldn't get it through the door.

573
00:44:37,887 --> 00:44:41,766
Announcement here. There's going
to be a delay on the clown.

574
00:44:41,847 --> 00:44:45,044
- What clown?
- Miles' mom hired a clown.

575
00:45:00,407 --> 00:45:02,079
You don't like clowns?

576
00:45:02,167 --> 00:45:04,886
Yeah, about fiive years ago.
Now they're so boring...

577
00:45:04,967 --> 00:45:07,481
they make me puke.

578
00:45:07,567 --> 00:45:12,436
The vest, the flower.
Screw them. That's all they get.

579
00:45:14,847 --> 00:45:17,759
I'm Pooter the Clown.
Put it there.

580
00:45:20,287 --> 00:45:21,640
Kids will love that.

581
00:45:21,727 --> 00:45:24,002
I didn't orderyou.
My sister-in-law did.

582
00:45:24,087 --> 00:45:26,282
She's not here.
I'm the uncle.

583
00:45:26,367 --> 00:45:29,837
- Buck Russell's the name.
- I'm sorry I'm late.

584
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:33,158
I was at this
all-night bachelorette party.

585
00:45:33,247 --> 00:45:35,078
Need any dildojokes?

586
00:45:35,167 --> 00:45:37,044
I'm the guy!

587
00:45:40,727 --> 00:45:42,957
Did you have a few drinks this morning?

588
00:45:44,127 --> 00:45:45,640
I thinkyou did, didn't you?

589
00:45:45,727 --> 00:45:49,197
Are you Mother Cabrini?
You never touch the stuff?

590
00:45:49,287 --> 00:45:53,405
No, but I wouldn't be drinking
if I was gonna entertain some kids.

591
00:45:53,487 --> 00:45:57,036
I don't have to take any shit from you.
You know who I am?

592
00:45:57,127 --> 00:46:01,040
In the fiield of local,
live home entertainment, I'm a god!

593
00:46:02,687 --> 00:46:06,202
Get in your mouse
and get out of here.

594
00:46:06,287 --> 00:46:08,847
Let me tell you something,
you lowlife...

595
00:46:08,927 --> 00:46:11,600
lying, four-flushing sack ofshit.

596
00:46:34,047 --> 00:46:36,641
Let's go out to the car.

597
00:46:38,487 --> 00:46:40,796
Why?

598
00:46:41,847 --> 00:46:43,963
What do you mean ''why''?

599
00:46:48,407 --> 00:46:50,477
Not now.

600
00:46:50,567 --> 00:46:51,920
It's fii ne.

601
00:46:53,967 --> 00:46:56,197
It's not fii ne.

602
00:46:56,287 --> 00:46:57,686
Why not?

603
00:46:59,127 --> 00:47:01,118
I don't feel right yet.

604
00:47:02,887 --> 00:47:05,082
You ever going to feel right?

605
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:12,158
I don't get where we're going.

606
00:47:12,247 --> 00:47:14,966
I told you 25 times.
We're going to pick up Tia.

607
00:47:15,047 --> 00:47:18,722
- She's eating at a cheerleader's house.
- So she says.

608
00:47:18,807 --> 00:47:22,197
Since when do cheerleaders
live in the woods?

609
00:47:25,327 --> 00:47:27,158
I'll take you home.

610
00:47:29,247 --> 00:47:31,602
I don't want to go home.

611
00:47:35,247 --> 00:47:36,999
I'm okay.

612
00:47:37,087 --> 00:47:38,440
Sure?

613
00:47:42,887 --> 00:47:44,286
Trust me.

614
00:47:55,767 --> 00:47:57,120
Shit!

615
00:48:13,087 --> 00:48:15,442
Well, well, well.

616
00:48:15,527 --> 00:48:19,076
They are scraping the bottom of
the barrel for cheerleaders these days.

617
00:48:20,367 --> 00:48:22,403
What are you doing here?

618
00:48:22,487 --> 00:48:26,480
We were going out for ice cream.
Thought you might like tojoin us.

619
00:48:26,567 --> 00:48:30,401
I said I'd be home at 1 0:00.
It's not even 9:00.

620
00:48:33,367 --> 00:48:37,406
Who said anything about that? I thought
you'd like tojoin us for ice cream.

621
00:48:37,487 --> 00:48:41,480
Maybe your ''Bug'' here can join us.
We can talk about burying the hatchet.

622
00:48:41,567 --> 00:48:44,718
- Do you know what a hatchet is, Bug?
- It's an ax?

623
00:48:44,807 --> 00:48:46,843
Sort of, yeah.

624
00:48:46,927 --> 00:48:49,202
I got one in the car
ifyou'd like to see it.

625
00:48:50,407 --> 00:48:52,682
- I'll pass.
- Fair enough.

626
00:48:52,767 --> 00:48:57,682
I like to carry it. You never know
when you're going to need it.

627
00:48:57,767 --> 00:49:00,565
A situation may come up.

628
00:49:00,647 --> 00:49:03,115
For example,
someone's been drinking...

629
00:49:03,207 --> 00:49:05,675
and about to drive
a loved one home.

630
00:49:05,767 --> 00:49:07,883
Then I like to know I have it.

631
00:49:07,967 --> 00:49:11,596
Not to kill, no.
Just to maim.

632
00:49:11,687 --> 00:49:14,360
Take a little off the shoulder.

633
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:17,363
The elbow.
Shave a little meat...

634
00:49:17,447 --> 00:49:19,563
off the old kneecap.

635
00:49:20,967 --> 00:49:22,923
You got both kneecaps?

636
00:49:23,007 --> 00:49:28,400
I like to keep mine razor-sharp.
Sharp enough to shave with them.

637
00:49:28,487 --> 00:49:30,955
I've been known
to circumcise a gnat.

638
00:49:31,047 --> 00:49:33,322
You're not a gnat, are you, Bug?

639
00:49:33,407 --> 00:49:35,284
Wait a minute.

640
00:49:35,367 --> 00:49:37,244
Bug. Gnat.

641
00:49:38,887 --> 00:49:41,162
Is there a similarity there?

642
00:49:42,927 --> 00:49:45,395
Whoa, I think there is.

643
00:49:47,687 --> 00:49:49,882
You understand
what I'm talking about?

644
00:49:51,367 --> 00:49:56,077
I don't thinkyou do.
I'll be right back.

645
00:50:02,527 --> 00:50:04,643
I'm sorry.

646
00:50:04,727 --> 00:50:06,683
I thinkyou'd better split.

647
00:50:06,767 --> 00:50:09,042
I don't want him going berserk
with an ax on me.

648
00:50:09,127 --> 00:50:10,480
He's all talk.

649
00:50:10,567 --> 00:50:13,161
Here it is!

650
00:50:13,247 --> 00:50:16,796
Come on over!
I want to show it to you.

651
00:50:18,207 --> 00:50:19,560
Maybe later.

652
00:50:27,367 --> 00:50:31,599
He's gone in a few days.
Just relax.

653
00:50:33,047 --> 00:50:35,083
I'll get him back.

654
00:50:48,647 --> 00:50:51,957
That's a stupid thing to do
during flu season.

655
00:50:52,047 --> 00:50:54,356
I bet she's getting the tongue.

656
00:51:54,207 --> 00:51:55,560
Just looking.

657
00:53:11,607 --> 00:53:12,642
Next.

658
00:53:15,367 --> 00:53:18,325
Let me go in fii rst.
I'll cover foryou.

659
00:53:18,407 --> 00:53:22,320
Give you more time to relax.
All right?

660
00:53:29,327 --> 00:53:30,965
Morning.

661
00:53:38,047 --> 00:53:39,958
I'm Anita Hoargarth.

662
00:53:40,047 --> 00:53:44,040
Buck Melanoma,
Moley Russell's wart.

663
00:53:46,847 --> 00:53:50,886
Not her wart.
I'm the wart.

664
00:53:50,967 --> 00:53:54,801
She's my tumor, my growth,
my pimple.

665
00:53:54,887 --> 00:53:56,764
I'm ''Uncle Wart.''

666
00:53:56,847 --> 00:53:58,963
Just old Buck ''Wart'' Russell,
they call me.

667
00:53:59,047 --> 00:54:02,357
Or Melanoma Head.
They'll call me that.

668
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:04,597
''Melanoma Head's'' coming.

669
00:54:04,687 --> 00:54:08,919
I'm sor-- Uncle, Maizy Russell's uncle.
I'm her uncle.

670
00:54:10,047 --> 00:54:12,845
Her mother set up
this conference with you.

671
00:54:12,927 --> 00:54:15,441
I'm assistant principal here...

672
00:54:15,527 --> 00:54:19,566
as you've probably noticed
from the indications on the door.

673
00:54:22,767 --> 00:54:24,758
- This door?
- The outer door!

674
00:54:24,847 --> 00:54:27,486
The outer door.
'Cause there's nothing on this one.

675
00:54:27,567 --> 00:54:29,444
That's about enough ofthat.

676
00:54:31,087 --> 00:54:32,679
Sorry.

677
00:54:33,927 --> 00:54:39,285
I've been an educator
for 31 .3 years...

678
00:54:39,367 --> 00:54:42,677
and in that time,
I've seen a lot of bad eggs.

679
00:54:42,767 --> 00:54:46,077
I say ''eggs'' because
at the elementary level...

680
00:54:46,167 --> 00:54:49,159
we are not dealing
with fully-developed individuals.

681
00:54:52,607 --> 00:54:57,556
I see a bad egg
when I look at your niece.

682
00:54:57,647 --> 00:55:00,559
She is a twiddler, a dreamer...

683
00:55:00,647 --> 00:55:03,957
a silly heart
and she is a jabberbox.

684
00:55:04,047 --> 00:55:06,117
And, frankly...

685
00:55:06,207 --> 00:55:08,767
I don't think she takes a thing...

686
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:13,557
in her life or her career
as a student seriously.

687
00:55:15,367 --> 00:55:17,039
She's only six.

688
00:55:17,127 --> 00:55:22,201
That is not a valid excuse!
I hear that every day and I dismiss it.

689
00:55:22,287 --> 00:55:26,041
I don't want to know a six-year-old
who isn't a dreamer or a silly heart.

690
00:55:26,127 --> 00:55:30,245
I sure don't want to know one who
takes their student career seriously.

691
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:33,956
I don't have a college degree.
I don't even have a job.

692
00:55:35,327 --> 00:55:39,718
Does anyone have a special story
to tell about something that happened?

693
00:55:41,607 --> 00:55:43,563
My uncle was microwaving my socks...

694
00:55:43,647 --> 00:55:46,480
and the dog threw up on the couch
for about an hour.

695
00:55:46,567 --> 00:55:49,923
Honest? Why was your uncle
microwaving your socks?

696
00:55:50,007 --> 00:55:52,999
He can't get the goddamn
washing machine to work.

697
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:54,725
Blasphemer!

698
00:55:54,807 --> 00:55:57,401
Iknowagoodkid when Isee one.

699
00:55:57,487 --> 00:55:59,443
Because they're aIIgoodkids...

700
00:55:59,527 --> 00:56:02,325
untiIdried-out, brain-deadskags
Iikeyou...

701
00:56:02,407 --> 00:56:04,796
drag them down andconvince them
they're nogood.

702
00:56:04,887 --> 00:56:08,562
You so much as scowl at my niece
or any other kid in this school...

703
00:56:08,647 --> 00:56:11,320
and I hear about it,
I'm coming looking foryou.

704
00:56:13,727 --> 00:56:17,276
Take this quarter.
Go downtown...

705
00:56:17,367 --> 00:56:19,756
and have a rat gnaw that thing
offyour face.

706
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:23,357
Good day to you, madam.

707
00:56:30,447 --> 00:56:31,675
Next.

708
00:56:31,767 --> 00:56:33,917
Ah, yeah!

709
00:56:52,647 --> 00:56:55,366
Hi, Chanice.
This is Terry.

710
00:56:55,447 --> 00:56:57,836
WaIt Bern--

711
00:56:57,927 --> 00:57:02,284
Would you get with the program?
Bernstein is his name.

712
00:57:02,367 --> 00:57:04,597
Iforgot togiveyou the number.
Don't get mad.

713
00:57:04,687 --> 00:57:07,599
I hope somebody knows
what they're doing down there.

714
00:57:07,687 --> 00:57:09,996
Chanice?Buck.

715
00:57:11,687 --> 00:57:13,837
Ihate these machines.

716
00:57:13,927 --> 00:57:17,283
I'mjust caIIing to say
Imissyou.

717
00:57:18,647 --> 00:57:21,400
IknowyouprobabIy don't beIieve it,
but it's true.

718
00:57:21,487 --> 00:57:23,398
No, Ihaven't been drinking.

719
00:57:23,487 --> 00:57:25,637
I've been thinking a Iot aboutyou...

720
00:57:25,727 --> 00:57:27,558
and what we've taIkedabout
thepast weeks.

721
00:57:27,647 --> 00:57:29,365
Ithinkaboutyou aII the time...

722
00:57:29,447 --> 00:57:32,883
andabout those two dimpIes
onyourbuns.

723
00:57:32,967 --> 00:57:34,480
Dimples.

724
00:57:34,567 --> 00:57:36,603
What did we caII them?

725
00:57:36,687 --> 00:57:39,963
The right wasLyndon
andthe Ieft wasJohnson.

726
00:57:40,047 --> 00:57:41,958
No, that wasyourboobs.

727
00:57:42,047 --> 00:57:45,278
No, yourboobs were Minnie andMickey.
Irememberthat because ofDisney WorId.

728
00:57:45,367 --> 00:57:47,483
AndFeIix is what we caIIedyour--

729
00:57:48,887 --> 00:57:51,685
Goddamn kids!

730
00:57:51,767 --> 00:57:54,406
Okay, come on, you,
get in the house.

731
00:57:54,487 --> 00:57:57,206
What are you doing out here
making all this noise?

732
00:57:57,287 --> 00:57:59,676
Get in the house where you belong.
Come on!

733
00:58:02,447 --> 00:58:06,076
- Who let the cat out?
- We don't have a cat.

734
00:58:06,167 --> 00:58:08,283
Come on, get out.

735
00:58:08,367 --> 00:58:10,244
Go on, shoo! Shoo!

736
00:58:19,607 --> 00:58:21,518
Open up.

737
00:58:28,367 --> 00:58:29,356
Hello?

738
00:58:29,447 --> 00:58:32,803
Hi. May I speak to Buck Russell?
This is a friend of his.

739
00:58:32,887 --> 00:58:34,400
Chanice KoboIowski.

740
00:58:36,487 --> 00:58:40,560
I'm sorry, Chanice.
He's not here right now.

741
00:58:42,087 --> 00:58:45,124
- Can you tell me when he'll be back?
- He went out with Marcie.

742
00:58:45,207 --> 00:58:47,926
The lady who lives across the street.

743
00:58:48,007 --> 00:58:50,043
They usually stay out pretty late.

744
00:58:54,327 --> 00:58:56,158
Do you want to leave a message?

745
00:59:02,767 --> 00:59:04,678
No, there's no message.

746
00:59:22,887 --> 00:59:24,718
No message.

747
00:59:48,887 --> 00:59:50,240
Hot!

748
01:00:03,047 --> 01:00:08,201
- Is there a big sexy guy in here?
- Please don't let it be true.

749
01:00:10,727 --> 01:00:14,402
Oh, my God!
What are you doing?

750
01:00:14,487 --> 01:00:16,717
The laundry.
What's it look like?

751
01:00:16,807 --> 01:00:20,277
Washing machine's still broken
so I thought I'd use the microwave.

752
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:23,040
Nuke them up.
Heats them up pretty good.

753
01:00:23,127 --> 01:00:25,436
It kills the germs
and odors that they cause.

754
01:00:25,527 --> 01:00:27,358
You don't know what you're doing.

755
01:00:27,447 --> 01:00:30,803
You're bored out ofyour mind.
You need adult supervision.

756
01:00:31,847 --> 01:00:33,121
Excuse me?

757
01:00:47,447 --> 01:00:50,837
- Come on.
- I don't want to dance.

758
01:00:50,927 --> 01:00:54,044
I don't feel like it. I'm not a dancer.
This is ridiculous.

759
01:00:54,127 --> 01:00:56,163
I'm not gonna leave
unless you do.

760
01:00:56,247 --> 01:00:58,715
Okay. One dance. That's it.

761
01:00:58,807 --> 01:01:01,765
I really have to take a nap and--

762
01:01:01,847 --> 01:01:04,281
One dance. That's it.

763
01:01:13,367 --> 01:01:14,766
What's this?

764
01:01:17,047 --> 01:01:20,005
Come on. The dog is watching.
What are you doing?

765
01:01:20,087 --> 01:01:22,476
Is that dirty dancing?

766
01:01:23,527 --> 01:01:26,280
Isn't that where you get the girl
by the neck and dip her?

767
01:01:27,527 --> 01:01:28,755
Remember that?

768
01:01:28,847 --> 01:01:30,439
Dips. Dips.

769
01:01:39,767 --> 01:01:41,997
Am I bleeding?

770
01:01:43,247 --> 01:01:46,000
Will you get off?
My back!

771
01:01:51,527 --> 01:01:53,597
Hello!

772
01:01:57,527 --> 01:01:59,404
I mean it.

773
01:02:01,527 --> 01:02:05,679
This is fun, isn't it?
I guess.

774
01:02:05,767 --> 01:02:09,760
My aerobic workout today.
Heart's beating like a rabbit here.

775
01:02:31,407 --> 01:02:32,760
Hi, Chanice.

776
01:02:33,847 --> 01:02:35,246
Surprise!

777
01:02:37,047 --> 01:02:39,197
- This is--
- Marcie.

778
01:02:42,807 --> 01:02:46,197
Yeah, Marcie.
And she lives across the road.

779
01:02:46,287 --> 01:02:49,085
- She came over to--
- Shut up, Buck.

780
01:02:49,167 --> 01:02:51,203
That's a good idea.

781
01:02:52,967 --> 01:02:55,083
Is this who you were out with
last night?

782
01:02:58,407 --> 01:03:01,717
What? I didn't go out last night.

783
01:03:03,727 --> 01:03:06,082
Honest! Honest!
I'm telling you the truth.

784
01:03:06,167 --> 01:03:09,443
- You son ofa bitch!
- Don't say that.

785
01:03:09,527 --> 01:03:11,882
Don't walk away. Chanice!

786
01:03:12,887 --> 01:03:14,400
Come here!

787
01:03:14,487 --> 01:03:16,318
Come here, hon.

788
01:03:19,127 --> 01:03:20,162
Wait!

789
01:03:20,247 --> 01:03:22,238
Wait. Let me explain.

790
01:03:23,287 --> 01:03:26,040
Chanice, I'm warning you.
You're wrecking the driveway.

791
01:03:28,687 --> 01:03:30,723
Come on!

792
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:32,445
I love you!

793
01:03:49,687 --> 01:03:51,405
What flew up her nose?

794
01:03:57,727 --> 01:04:00,958
You better go home.
Okay, Marcie?

795
01:04:01,047 --> 01:04:03,925
Pick up your records.
The party's over.

796
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:17,526
So, I'll just go home and wait
for the Federal Express man.

797
01:04:26,007 --> 01:04:28,919
Good night, Uncle Buck.

798
01:04:29,007 --> 01:04:30,838
Good night, sweetheart.

799
01:04:39,847 --> 01:04:42,486
- Uncle Buck?
- Yeah?

800
01:04:42,567 --> 01:04:46,242
- Got a minute?
- I got lots of minutes.

801
01:04:46,327 --> 01:04:50,206
Now everything's okay with my grandpa,
I want to go out tomorrow night.

802
01:04:50,287 --> 01:04:53,643
You can go crazy after I leave.
Until then, I'm not letting you out.

803
01:05:00,007 --> 01:05:04,159
- You can't fii nd any way to be cool?
- You mean easy? No.

804
01:05:04,247 --> 01:05:06,477
- I mean decent!
- You mean blind.

805
01:05:06,567 --> 01:05:10,719
Who are you trying to score points with?
My parents?

806
01:05:10,807 --> 01:05:13,082
How many times have they had you here
since we moved?

807
01:05:13,167 --> 01:05:16,443
Try none, until they went up shit creek
and got stuck.

808
01:05:16,527 --> 01:05:19,200
Get used on your parents' time.

809
01:05:20,847 --> 01:05:22,724
Yeah?

810
01:05:22,807 --> 01:05:25,082
Have a bad day today?

811
01:05:27,767 --> 01:05:30,759
It hurts when someone screws
with your life, doesn't it?

812
01:05:48,687 --> 01:05:50,166
Last call.

813
01:05:54,367 --> 01:05:56,403
There you go.

814
01:05:59,047 --> 01:06:01,038
A little foryou,
a little for me.

815
01:06:06,647 --> 01:06:08,160
Boy!

816
01:06:10,167 --> 01:06:14,957
People used to say to me,
''Buck, you are one lucky son ofa bitch.

817
01:06:17,207 --> 01:06:19,516
You got it made, Buck.''

818
01:06:19,607 --> 01:06:21,598
And I did.

819
01:06:21,687 --> 01:06:23,882
They'd say, ''Man, look at you.

820
01:06:23,967 --> 01:06:25,923
You don't have any kids,
any wife.

821
01:06:26,007 --> 01:06:29,397
You don't have a desk,
an offiice.

822
01:06:29,487 --> 01:06:32,684
You don't have a boss
to worry about.''

823
01:06:35,927 --> 01:06:39,203
They were right.
I had it made.

824
01:06:44,527 --> 01:06:47,758
Only thing now is, Perce...

825
01:06:48,807 --> 01:06:51,321
nobody says that anymore.

826
01:06:55,527 --> 01:06:57,438
Oh, boy.

827
01:06:57,527 --> 01:06:59,483
But...

828
01:06:59,567 --> 01:07:01,842
it'll all be better tomorrow.

829
01:07:04,247 --> 01:07:06,124
It always is.

830
01:07:08,487 --> 01:07:12,002
Because tomorrow,
we go to the track...

831
01:07:12,087 --> 01:07:15,682
win some dough,
some serious dough.

832
01:07:19,607 --> 01:07:22,326
Make a lot of money tomorrow, kiddo.

833
01:07:22,407 --> 01:07:24,841
Want a little pretzel
with your beer?

834
01:07:30,767 --> 01:07:32,883
U.B. went to school
to pickyou up.

835
01:07:32,967 --> 01:07:35,720
Tell U.B. when he gets home
that he lost. Okay?

836
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:37,399
Lost what?

837
01:07:37,487 --> 01:07:40,843
Just tell him. He'll know what it means.
I'll see you guys Sunday.

838
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:43,805
- What day is today?
- Friday.

839
01:07:43,887 --> 01:07:46,526
- You know what that means.
-Jumbo party.

840
01:07:46,607 --> 01:07:49,644
You can put that on a platter
and serve it up hot.

841
01:08:47,407 --> 01:08:48,886
U.B.'s home.

842
01:08:48,967 --> 01:08:51,037
Tia? Tia!

843
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:52,958
You guys seen Tia?

844
01:08:53,047 --> 01:08:54,605
She took a breeze.

845
01:08:57,807 --> 01:09:01,516
And she promised me she was going
to look afteryou guys this evening.

846
01:09:01,607 --> 01:09:04,599
She promised me!
So much for promises.

847
01:09:04,687 --> 01:09:07,520
Does anyone in this house
know how to keep a promise?

848
01:09:07,607 --> 01:09:10,075
I know you two do.

849
01:09:10,167 --> 01:09:13,318
I had somewhere important
to go tonight.

850
01:09:13,407 --> 01:09:15,557
This is how I make my living.

851
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:19,196
This was very important to me.
My whole year was based on tonight.

852
01:09:19,287 --> 01:09:22,723
It may be peanuts to your dad,
but it's my living.

853
01:09:22,807 --> 01:09:26,959
I have no choice. I don't care
what your parents will say.

854
01:09:27,047 --> 01:09:29,003
- I have to take you with me tonight.
- Where?

855
01:09:29,087 --> 01:09:31,521
To a racetrack.

856
01:09:33,967 --> 01:09:37,118
Here we go.
Do you have to go to the bathroom?

857
01:09:37,207 --> 01:09:39,038
- You sure?
- Yep.

858
01:09:39,127 --> 01:09:42,358
This is going to be fun.
Beautiful horses, interesting people.

859
01:09:43,567 --> 01:09:46,525
- And we'll win some serious coin?
- Sometimes.

860
01:09:46,607 --> 01:09:50,156
That's not the real reason
people go there. People go...

861
01:09:50,247 --> 01:09:53,557
because ofthe beautiful horses...

862
01:09:53,647 --> 01:09:56,002
and colorful jockeys, and--

863
01:09:56,087 --> 01:09:58,555
Bug picked up Tia?

864
01:09:58,647 --> 01:10:00,717
She said she was going to a party.

865
01:10:00,807 --> 01:10:04,243
She said she'd be back Sunday.
Must be a slumber party.

866
01:10:06,687 --> 01:10:09,599
Hop in the back.
Get your belts on.

867
01:10:10,567 --> 01:10:14,162
Let her go to a party all weekend!
She's old enough to know better.

868
01:10:15,087 --> 01:10:17,885
She doesn't listen to anybody anyway.

869
01:10:17,967 --> 01:10:19,366
Damn kids.

870
01:11:01,007 --> 01:11:02,679
Yeah? Kobolowski Tires.

871
01:11:03,447 --> 01:11:05,005
Hi. It's me.

872
01:11:05,087 --> 01:11:07,726
Can't you ever take a hint?

873
01:11:07,807 --> 01:11:11,243
It's not about me.
I got a problem at the house.

874
01:11:11,327 --> 01:11:13,477
Ineedsomebody to watch the kids.

875
01:11:13,567 --> 01:11:15,398
No, I'll tell you what you need.

876
01:11:15,487 --> 01:11:18,047
Your horse fiixer's in town
and you need to get to the track.

877
01:11:18,127 --> 01:11:20,197
I ran into Rog.
He told me all about it.

878
01:11:20,287 --> 01:11:23,245
The idiot hadthe nerve
to ask me fora Ioan.

879
01:11:23,327 --> 01:11:26,683
What, you can't take children when
you're going to cheat on a horse race?

880
01:11:26,767 --> 01:11:28,917
You got some religion
out there in the 'burbs?

881
01:11:29,007 --> 01:11:32,124
I came close. I had them in the car.

882
01:11:32,207 --> 01:11:35,324
Can we put our personal problems aside?

883
01:11:35,407 --> 01:11:38,524
Tia took off on me. I was supposed
to pick her up after school.

884
01:11:38,607 --> 01:11:40,518
- She wasn 't there.
- She ran away?

885
01:11:40,607 --> 01:11:43,804
I guess. I don't know.

886
01:11:43,887 --> 01:11:46,196
She's 1 5. She's angry.

887
01:11:46,287 --> 01:11:49,802
She's confused.
AndIneedto findher.

888
01:11:50,807 --> 01:11:53,116
Can you help me?

889
01:11:53,967 --> 01:11:56,117
I'm reaIIystuck.

890
01:11:59,087 --> 01:12:03,683
All right. I will help you
because there's kids involved.

891
01:12:03,767 --> 01:12:05,837
But as far as you and I
are concerned...

892
01:12:05,927 --> 01:12:07,758
it is over.

893
01:12:08,767 --> 01:12:10,598
However it has to be.

894
01:12:12,527 --> 01:12:14,438
- I'll be there.
- Thankyou.

895
01:12:14,527 --> 01:12:16,643
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.

896
01:12:37,327 --> 01:12:39,158
Your car's on fii re.

897
01:12:39,247 --> 01:12:41,363
No. It'sjust a little oil.

898
01:12:41,447 --> 01:12:44,041
I'm looking for a party
somewhere around here.

899
01:12:44,127 --> 01:12:45,958
That's on Totowa Lane.

900
01:12:46,047 --> 01:12:47,878
My niece is there.

901
01:12:47,967 --> 01:12:50,037
- Our son is there.
- Kids!

902
01:12:50,127 --> 01:12:53,244
I don't thinkyou ought to go in there
with that hat on. They'll kill you.

903
01:12:53,327 --> 01:12:55,318
Really? Thanks for the tip.

904
01:13:39,247 --> 01:13:43,479
I'm supposed to come over
and watch you.

905
01:13:46,127 --> 01:13:50,803
Hi. I'm Chanice Kobolowski.
I'm Uncle Buck's friend.

906
01:13:50,887 --> 01:13:52,605
May I see your driver's license?

907
01:13:53,807 --> 01:13:55,399
Yeah.

908
01:13:55,487 --> 01:13:58,684
Sure. Good idea.

909
01:13:59,887 --> 01:14:02,276
Wait. I got it.

910
01:14:03,847 --> 01:14:05,724
See. Look.

911
01:14:05,807 --> 01:14:08,560
- Please take it out.
- Take it out?

912
01:14:31,527 --> 01:14:33,597
You okay?

913
01:14:33,687 --> 01:14:35,917
What's the matter?

914
01:14:59,007 --> 01:15:01,521
Coming through. How you doing?

915
01:15:02,647 --> 01:15:04,558
Having a good time?

916
01:15:04,647 --> 01:15:07,241
Have you seen
a guy named Bug?

917
01:15:08,367 --> 01:15:11,120
I'm Tia Russell's uncle.
You know Tia?

918
01:15:11,207 --> 01:15:15,120
No? She's kind of new.
I'm her uncle.

919
01:15:15,207 --> 01:15:18,836
You haven't seen the Bug
around here, have you?

920
01:15:18,927 --> 01:15:20,918
Nice guy.

921
01:15:21,007 --> 01:15:23,567
Hey, come back here with that!

922
01:15:29,527 --> 01:15:33,406
How you doing?
Anybody seen Bug around here?

923
01:15:33,487 --> 01:15:36,365
Hey, nice music.

924
01:15:36,447 --> 01:15:39,962
Who is that, the Grass Roots?
I'm kidding. I know my music.

925
01:15:45,767 --> 01:15:48,281
Stop it, please.

926
01:15:50,727 --> 01:15:54,686
What the hell is that?
Hey, party time!

927
01:15:54,767 --> 01:15:58,521
Let's get down here!
You seen Bug around here?

928
01:15:58,607 --> 01:16:01,679
You seen Bug?
That's good stuff.

929
01:16:03,207 --> 01:16:05,243
Keep it up.

930
01:16:05,327 --> 01:16:07,397
Nice work.

931
01:16:07,487 --> 01:16:10,285
How you doing?
Excuse me.

932
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:11,959
Crowded, huh?

933
01:16:15,327 --> 01:16:17,682
I don't want to do this.

934
01:16:17,767 --> 01:16:19,678
Just relax.

935
01:16:21,487 --> 01:16:25,196
Hello, young fellow.
I'm Tia Russell's uncle, Buck Russell.

936
01:16:25,287 --> 01:16:28,757
Have you seen the Bug around?
No? I'm looking for him.

937
01:16:28,847 --> 01:16:32,044
You're Tia Russell's uncle?
Really?

938
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:34,402
Hey, give me that!

939
01:16:34,487 --> 01:16:37,001
Take my hat, you punk!

940
01:16:37,087 --> 01:16:39,203
- Don't mention it.
- All right, Pop.

941
01:16:41,447 --> 01:16:45,725
You haven't seen a guy named Bug,
have you? Everybody knows Bug. Hip guy.

942
01:16:45,807 --> 01:16:49,322
Let me through, will you?
Your mother know you do that?

943
01:16:52,687 --> 01:16:54,837
This room's taken.

944
01:16:54,927 --> 01:16:56,918
- I want to go.
- No, you don't.

945
01:17:00,367 --> 01:17:03,803
That door opens,
I'm going to kick somebody's ass!

946
01:17:04,767 --> 01:17:06,644
Did you hear me?

947
01:19:12,727 --> 01:19:14,604
You were right.

948
01:19:16,047 --> 01:19:18,800
Everything you said
would happen happened.

949
01:19:20,447 --> 01:19:23,200
I don't want to talk about it.
I just want to get you home.

950
01:19:57,047 --> 01:19:58,924
Is this a trick?

951
01:20:03,527 --> 01:20:05,404
No.

952
01:20:08,367 --> 01:20:10,358
You know what happened?

953
01:20:12,767 --> 01:20:14,120
Yeah.

954
01:20:17,247 --> 01:20:20,239
Are you going to tell my parents
about everything that's been going on?

955
01:20:22,767 --> 01:20:24,997
No.

956
01:20:26,767 --> 01:20:28,598
Thanks.

957
01:20:31,567 --> 01:20:35,845
I've been riding your butt all week
about how you live your life.

958
01:20:37,927 --> 01:20:41,363
I realized maybe somebody
should have been riding mine.

959
01:20:41,447 --> 01:20:44,757
I'm probably the last guy in the world
you'd want to help...

960
01:20:47,567 --> 01:20:50,081
but I really could use your advice
vis-a-vis Chanice.

961
01:20:51,727 --> 01:20:53,319
I've been...

962
01:20:53,407 --> 01:20:58,003
stringing her along
for about eight years now.

963
01:20:58,087 --> 01:21:01,204
Maybe you could fii gure out
what the hell is wrong with me.

964
01:21:02,607 --> 01:21:04,996
I did such a greatjob earning
your trust and admiration...

965
01:21:05,087 --> 01:21:08,159
I'm confused why
I can't do the same with Chanice.

966
01:21:17,167 --> 01:21:19,522
You know, there's...

967
01:21:21,487 --> 01:21:24,559
one family charity case...

968
01:21:25,887 --> 01:21:28,196
that loves you very much.

969
01:21:29,567 --> 01:21:30,761
I'm sorry.

970
01:21:32,287 --> 01:21:34,278
Come on.

971
01:21:34,367 --> 01:21:37,006
Nothing to be sorry about.

972
01:21:37,087 --> 01:21:40,636
I'm just kind of glad
I got a chance to know you again.

973
01:21:44,607 --> 01:21:47,405
Did you do anything to Bug?

974
01:21:53,847 --> 01:21:55,599
Oh, my God!

975
01:21:56,647 --> 01:21:58,877
What did you do?

976
01:22:08,687 --> 01:22:11,645
You shithead!
I could have suffocated!

977
01:22:11,727 --> 01:22:14,685
Do you know what I'd like you to do?

978
01:22:14,767 --> 01:22:18,840
You could be doing both of us a favor.
I'd like you to apologize to the lady.

979
01:22:18,927 --> 01:22:21,157
I'm sorry!

980
01:22:22,607 --> 01:22:24,279
Okay, asshole?

981
01:22:24,367 --> 01:22:26,005
I'm sorry!

982
01:22:26,087 --> 01:22:29,716
I don't know if I've told you this,
but I'm an amateur dentist.

983
01:22:30,327 --> 01:22:32,716
Oh, yes, he is.

984
01:22:40,207 --> 01:22:41,435
I'm sorry.

985
01:22:42,287 --> 01:22:43,800
Get him out.

986
01:22:43,887 --> 01:22:46,959
Yeah? It was halfhearted.
We'll let him.

987
01:22:47,047 --> 01:22:50,039
- I'm really sorry.
- I'm sure you are.

988
01:22:50,127 --> 01:22:53,039
- I am.
- Let me get you. There you go.

989
01:22:53,127 --> 01:22:56,039
I didn't mean to hurt anybody.

990
01:22:56,127 --> 01:22:57,560
There you go.

991
01:22:57,647 --> 01:22:59,319
I'm sorry.

992
01:23:06,407 --> 01:23:08,318
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

993
01:23:14,647 --> 01:23:17,844
Yeah? Come on back
and I'll kickyour ass, man!

994
01:23:17,927 --> 01:23:21,237
Chicken shit! You're dead!

995
01:23:21,327 --> 01:23:22,965
Shit.

996
01:23:28,407 --> 01:23:30,682
I'm going to sue your balls off, man!

997
01:23:30,767 --> 01:23:34,601
Why don't you come and get me, man?
Come on!

998
01:23:35,607 --> 01:23:39,964
Come on, man. I'm going to sue you
and your whole family!

999
01:23:40,047 --> 01:23:43,323
Okay, pal,
time for a golf lesson.

1000
01:23:43,407 --> 01:23:45,637
My dad's a lawyer!
You're history!

1001
01:23:45,727 --> 01:23:48,605
A little fiive wood.

1002
01:23:50,447 --> 01:23:53,678
What? What?
What are you doing, man?

1003
01:23:56,887 --> 01:24:00,084
You're history. You're wasted. I'm going
to sue you for everything you've got!

1004
01:24:00,167 --> 01:24:02,840
You're going to be broke
so come and get me!

1005
01:24:04,367 --> 01:24:06,597
You fat sucker!

1006
01:24:06,687 --> 01:24:07,836
Yes, sir!

1007
01:24:09,007 --> 01:24:11,805
You son ofa bitch!
That hurt!

1008
01:24:11,887 --> 01:24:15,516
Hey! I'm not sorry, all right?

1009
01:24:15,607 --> 01:24:18,041
I ain't sorry for shit!

1010
01:24:20,847 --> 01:24:24,044
What do you see in that guy anyway?

1011
01:24:24,127 --> 01:24:26,721
I can't for the life of me
fii gure that one out.

1012
01:24:26,807 --> 01:24:29,924
Don't answer. You don't have to.

1013
01:24:32,647 --> 01:24:35,719
I appreciate the confession.
Thanks a lot.

1014
01:24:35,807 --> 01:24:37,877
But my problems with Buck
go deeper...

1015
01:24:37,967 --> 01:24:40,117
than a misunderstanding
with a neighbor lady.

1016
01:24:40,207 --> 01:24:42,038
Don't you think he loves you?

1017
01:24:44,047 --> 01:24:45,958
If he does, he'd never say it.

1018
01:24:46,047 --> 01:24:47,719
What if he did?

1019
01:24:47,807 --> 01:24:50,241
Then I would suspect
he needed a new set oftires.

1020
01:24:51,447 --> 01:24:52,800
Seriously.

1021
01:24:52,887 --> 01:24:56,084
Seriously, you're very sweet
to talk about this.

1022
01:24:57,407 --> 01:24:59,477
But you don't understand
the bigger picture.

1023
01:24:59,567 --> 01:25:02,240
Buck's a charming man
who wants to remain a boy forever.

1024
01:25:04,687 --> 01:25:08,726
At my age, that doesn't make
for a lasting relationship.

1025
01:25:10,567 --> 01:25:13,365
I think he'd make
a wonderful husband and father.

1026
01:25:13,447 --> 01:25:15,165
- You do?
- Oh, yeah.

1027
01:25:15,247 --> 01:25:16,885
My sister and brother adore him.

1028
01:25:18,327 --> 01:25:23,117
He really has changed
since he's been here this week.

1029
01:25:23,207 --> 01:25:25,562
He really has changed.

1030
01:25:25,647 --> 01:25:28,844
He's responsible, caring...

1031
01:25:28,927 --> 01:25:30,997
loving...

1032
01:25:31,087 --> 01:25:34,841
and enthusiastic.

1033
01:25:34,927 --> 01:25:39,717
- Energetic.
- And energetic and decent.

1034
01:25:41,647 --> 01:25:43,126
Kind and--

1035
01:25:45,247 --> 01:25:47,158
And humble...

1036
01:25:47,247 --> 01:25:49,317
and honest and forthright.

1037
01:25:49,407 --> 01:25:50,681
Sense of humor.

1038
01:25:50,767 --> 01:25:52,723
And he's really got
a great sense of humor.

1039
01:25:52,807 --> 01:25:55,480
Did he put you up to this?

1040
01:25:55,567 --> 01:25:57,319
No!

1041
01:25:57,407 --> 01:26:01,116
No. I'vejust gathered this
from my own observations.

1042
01:26:03,527 --> 01:26:05,438
- It'sjust the way he is.
- Really?

1043
01:26:13,087 --> 01:26:15,965
- Really?
- Oh, yeah!

1044
01:26:16,047 --> 01:26:18,641
So unlike him.

1045
01:26:32,967 --> 01:26:34,923
Check this out.

1046
01:26:39,887 --> 01:26:41,639
Hi, honey.

1047
01:26:41,727 --> 01:26:43,957
Is the coffee ready?

1048
01:26:45,007 --> 01:26:46,838
A little thirsty.

1049
01:26:46,927 --> 01:26:50,158
By the way, I have told you
I loved you...

1050
01:26:50,247 --> 01:26:53,000
and it wasn't for tires, sweetheart.

1051
01:26:53,087 --> 01:26:55,123
It was for shocks, remember?

1052
01:27:00,127 --> 01:27:02,277
Are they sweethearts or what?

1053
01:27:02,367 --> 01:27:05,916
This one's smart as a whip.
I'm going to miss them like crazy.

1054
01:27:06,007 --> 01:27:08,840
They're beautiful children.
What happened to you?

1055
01:27:08,927 --> 01:27:11,487
Recessive gene,
skips every nine generations.

1056
01:27:11,567 --> 01:27:14,081
I got it this time.
Tragic.

1057
01:27:14,167 --> 01:27:16,283
It isn't so bad, is it?

1058
01:27:16,367 --> 01:27:17,720
What?

1059
01:27:17,807 --> 01:27:19,638
The house, the family, the kids.

1060
01:27:19,727 --> 01:27:22,799
Oh, yeah. It was great.
This is great.

1061
01:27:22,887 --> 01:27:26,926
We should have done this
a long time ago, you and I.

1062
01:27:40,447 --> 01:27:42,324
They're here.

1063
01:27:47,687 --> 01:27:50,997
What are we doing?

1064
01:27:51,087 --> 01:27:52,759
Your mother...

1065
01:27:52,847 --> 01:27:54,997
and your sister have to...

1066
01:27:55,087 --> 01:27:58,159
sort some things out.

1067
01:27:58,247 --> 01:28:00,238
So we're going to be very quiet
for them.

1068
01:28:00,327 --> 01:28:02,795
So why don't we put a button on it...

1069
01:28:06,127 --> 01:28:08,118
and a zipper like that...

1070
01:28:08,207 --> 01:28:10,437
and a lock.

1071
01:28:10,527 --> 01:28:13,963
I can't talk at all.
I throw the key away.

1072
01:29:06,127 --> 01:29:10,439
It's going to be real different.
I promise.

1073
01:29:10,527 --> 01:29:12,916
I love you.

1074
01:29:24,367 --> 01:29:25,561
Shit!

1075
01:29:25,647 --> 01:29:28,923
- Bye.
- Bye, Uncle Buck.

1076
01:29:29,007 --> 01:29:31,316
Could I get out the door, please?

1077
01:29:31,407 --> 01:29:33,363
- I'm going!
- This is heavy.

1078
01:29:33,447 --> 01:29:36,086
Bye, Chanice.

1079
01:29:36,167 --> 01:29:37,680
Thanks again, Buck.

1080
01:29:37,767 --> 01:29:41,555
Next time you're downtown,
maybe we can go out for a coffee.

1081
01:29:45,927 --> 01:29:48,919
We really had a good time.
I know it's ridiculous.

1082
01:29:49,007 --> 01:29:52,204
We did leave the house a little messy.
We tried. We're not so good at clean.

1083
01:29:52,287 --> 01:29:55,165
- What?
- We're going home. We're not dying.

1084
01:29:55,247 --> 01:29:58,444
I'm saying good-bye.
Is that all right? Nice guy!

1085
01:29:58,527 --> 01:30:02,406
Tell the neighbors we're sorry about
having that parked in the driveway.

1086
01:30:02,487 --> 01:30:05,524
- He's getting a new company car Monday.
- The hell I am!

1087
01:30:05,607 --> 01:30:08,724
- It's good for another 1 00,000 miles.
- Too bad you're not.

1088
01:30:08,807 --> 01:30:12,436
That's funny, Chanice. See what
I put up with? And don't drive fast.

1089
01:30:12,527 --> 01:30:15,724
I'm not fiixing
any more tickets foryou.
