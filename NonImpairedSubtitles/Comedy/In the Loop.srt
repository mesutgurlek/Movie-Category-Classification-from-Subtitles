1
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,551
(hammering)

2
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,679
Good morning,
my little chicks and cocks.

3
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,631
Malcolm, monitoring... All the usual.

4
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,035
How did your team do at the weekend?

5
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,754
- All right, yeah, we won.
- (whispers) Wanker.

6
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,758
Sam, morning. How are you?

7
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,952
Well, pop-pickers,
what disc shall we start with today?

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,389
Wonky Ron
or how about Simon Foster?

9
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,432
On the Eddie Mair
PM programme on the BBC.

10
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,120
(recording) MAlR:
Well, I'm joined by Simon Foster,

11
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,435
the Minister
for lnternational Development.

12
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,437
You've been in the job for 18 months.

13
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,391
Do you think you're making headway?

14
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,317
S I MON FOSTE R :
Yes, I do.

15
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,034
You'd expect me to say that, I suppose.

16
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,598
WOMAN :
Mark.

17
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,280
You're co-ordinating
the Millennium Goals press release?

18
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,118
Co-ordinate it better, please.

19
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,071
Is that the minister?

20
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,428
OK.

21
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,397
Have we heard anything from Malcolm
about last night's interview?

22
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,351
No, not yet.

23
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,517
- Perhaps he didn't hear it.
- Or maybe he's dead.

24
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,119
He might be dead!

25
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,516
He might have finally had that
massive stroke he's been heading for.

26
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,710
It's been in the fucking post.

27
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,719
Preventable sickness in many of the
poorest countries around the world.

28
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,956
And of course,
the big one is diarrhoea...

29
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,755
Ah, diarrhoea. This is the M inister
for I nternational Development.

30
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,871
He should be talking about
food parcels,

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,150
not fucking arse-spraying mayhem.

32
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,431
So if we can tackle the easy things
like diarrhoea, then we can...

33
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,790
Oh, say it again. Yes, very good.

34
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,831
What is this, the shitting forecast?

35
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,837
..hopefully that will strike another blow

36
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,791
in the war against
preventable diseases.

37
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,717
MAl R: You mentioned the word "war".
- Steady, Eddie.

38
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,592
FOSTE R :
Against preventable diseases.

39
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,950
MAl R :
All the evidence now points to

40
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,277
a US military intervention
in the Middle East.

41
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,277
Is that your view?

42
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,870
FOSTE R : Well, personally,
I think that war is unforeseeable.

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,433
Sam. Sam!

44
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,073
MAl R : Unforeseeable?
FOSTE R : Yes.

45
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,919
No, you do not think that!

46
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,031
Sam, I'm going to have to go

47
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,630
to lnternational Development
to pull Simon Foster's fucking hair.

48
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,591
He did not say "unforeseeable".

49
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,553
You may have heard him say that,
but he did not say that.

50
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,079
And that is a fact.

51
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,031
Now, he's gonna want you to row back

52
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,879
on that "unforeseeable" thing
on Question Time tonight.

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,879
On Question Time, you know the funny
question they always have at the end?

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,194
Yes.

55
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,151
I think we should prep that now.

56
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,510
Cos I'd like to shine on
the funny question.

57
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,756
I'm a funny guy, with a light touch.

58
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,031
There's this guy, he's a property
tycoon. He bought a South Sea island.

59
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,152
It might be something like that.
If you had to spend the rest of your life

60
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,635
on a desert island with someone,
who would it be with?

61
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,274
Well...I can't say my wife
cos I haven't got one.

62
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,836
I can't say my girlfriend, because
I haven't got one of those either.

63
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,589
- And don't say Mandela. That's...
- No, no, boring. And a bloke.

64
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,119
Or Keira Knightley.

65
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,231
That's a good idea.

66
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,874
Pervert. Sex. Minister.
People don't want to know.

67
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,433
I don't think so.

68
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,596
Did you take
the washing out of the machine?

69
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,392
- No.
- What do you mean "no"?

70
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,636
No, I didn't take
the washing out of the machine.

71
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,910
- It's gonna go really stale...
- lt'll be fine.

72
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,235
- It's not fine.
- It's fine. I'll wear stale pants.

73
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,555
I don't want to go out
with someone in stale pants.

74
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,636
Well, there we go.
I could go commando.

75
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,115
But I don't think
that's accepted in government.

76
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,595
Have you got everything
you need for your first day?

77
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,551
Oh, yes, all in here.
My massive intellect

78
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,875
and an apple for Simon Foster.

79
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,831
Simon "Fluster", don't you mean?

80
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,076
Don't call him that. I'm rebranding him.

81
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,509
He was absolutely crap
on the radio last night.

82
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,710
He sounded like a chicken
with a wasp up its arse.

83
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,592
You give me a week,
I'll have him sounding

84
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,551
Iike a chicken
without a wasp up its arse.

85
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,274
Good luck at the Foreign Office.
Try not to annoy Russia.

86
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,197
- See you later.
- See you later.

87
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,595
I'll give you a call later.
Keep your phone on.

88
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,314
- Be careful. Cars.
- Oh, really? Thanks for that.

89
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,396
Helpful...

90
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,950
OK, OK, go ahead
and print "unforeseeable".

91
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,672
Listen, assume I tell your wife

92
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,314
about you and Angela Heaney
at the Blackpool conference,

93
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,829
what would be best,
an e-mail, a phone call or what?

94
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,679
I could write it on a cake!
With those little silver balls.

95
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,439
"Your hack husband
betrayed you on October 4th...

96
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,516
and congratulations on the new baby."

97
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,870
Yeah,
maybe it's better to spike it, yeah.

98
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,831
OK, fuckity bye.

99
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,076
WOMAN: (on phone)
Did you put away the lasagne?

100
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,111
Yes, of course, it's in the fridge.

101
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,390
It's got Clingfilm on it and everything.

102
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,317
Why did you put Clingfilm on it?

103
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,360
Because that keeps it fresh.
That's the point of Clingfilm.

104
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,118
No, I don't want to hold.

105
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,229
It might dry out.

106
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,509
That's an amateur mistake.

107
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,996
I'm not holding any longer. What's
he waiting for, a fucking sex change?

108
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,269
It's not carcinogenic.

109
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,197
What, Simon Foster?

110
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,117
Clingfilm doesn't give you cancer.

111
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,037
Diarrhoea Of A Nobody. I like that.

112
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,991
- Aluminium foil...
- Apropos of that...

113
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,953
..gives you AlDS, or, you know,
lasagne gives you syphilis.

114
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,548
- It's not a thing.
- No, you relax!

115
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,159
God, who's that?

116
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,111
MALCOLM:
Get me fucking Brian!

117
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,152
Ifyou don't get me fucking Brian,
I'm gonna come over there.

118
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,316
I'm gonna lock you in
a fucking flotation tank

119
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,635
and pump it full of sewage
until you fucking drown.

120
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,638
- Paris Hilton.
- Are you serious?

121
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,193
- Lily Allen.
- No, no women.

122
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,833
(phone rings)

123
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,757
- Yeah?
- The Olsen twins.

124
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,314
- Thank you.
- Who's that?

125
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,671
- Malcolm. He's coming to see you.
- Oh, shit, he's still alive.

126
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,916
- When's he due?
MALCOLM: Now!

127
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,713
And don't say you weren't prepared,
because I rang ahead.

128
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,070
Give us a minute,
could you, please, love?

129
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,909
In the words
of the late, great Nat King fucking Cole,

130
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,349
unforeseeable, that's what you are.

131
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,436
WOMAN:
Who's that geezer?

132
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,877
Oh, I know who he is.

133
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,230
You're Dan, right?

134
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,590
- Daniel? The new adviser?
- Toby.

135
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,631
Toby. Oh. Sorry about the "Dan" thing.

136
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,593
You guys are often called "Dan"
so it's worth a punt.

137
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,438
I'm Judy, by the way. Judy Molloy.

138
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,233
Director of Communications
for lnternational Development.

139
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,429
Is this a normal morning?

140
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,516
The minister was rubbish
on last night's interview...

141
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,790
- He was rubbish?
- Yes. Rubbish.

142
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,390
Come on, Malcolm, he asked me for...
for a personal opinion.

143
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,671
Why didn't you say? He asked you.
Fuck, of course, that explains it.

144
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,951
If he'd asked you to fucking black up,
or to give him your PlN number

145
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,116
or to shit yourself,
would you have done that?

146
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,754
Blacked up, yes.
It was radio, nobody would've known.

147
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,029
Very good.

148
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,515
War is basically unforeseeable, isn't it?

149
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,677
That is not our line.
Walk the fucking line.

150
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,792
We've got Karen Clark
over from Washington today.

151
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,229
We've got enough
fucking Pentagon goons here

152
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,793
to stage a fucking coup d'état.

153
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,070
- Minister.
MALCOLM: Not the time, love.

154
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,031
- I'm busy. Fuck off.
- This is Toby.

155
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,357
Toby, hi. I'm glad you could make it.
It's a bit of an odd morning here.

156
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,948
Welcome to the madhouse.
I apologise for Malcolm.

157
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,674
Don't apologise for me.
Apologise for yourself.

158
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,519
Did I not just tell you to fuck off
and yet you're still here?

159
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,437
It's true, I am, yes, still here.

160
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,039
Hi, foetus boy,

161
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,674
Iesson one, I tell you to fuck off,
what do you do?

162
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,631
Eff off?

163
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,591
You'll go far.

164
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,597
- Now, fuck off.
- Right.

165
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,510
Judy and I were thinking that I could
row back on Question Time tonight.

166
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,915
You're not on Question Time.
You've been disinvited.

167
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,589
- We've been prepping Question Time.
- Why wasn't I told about this?

168
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,757
Why the fuck would I tell you about it?
I told you to fuck off twice.

169
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,509
It's a scheduled media appearance by
this department's secretary of state

170
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,517
so it falls well within my purview.

171
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,119
- Within your purview?
- Yes.

172
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,676
Where do you think you are, some
fucking Regency costume drama?

173
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,270
This is a government department,
not a fucking Jane fucking Austen novel.

174
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,198
SlMON: Malcolm...
- Allow me to pop a jaunty little bonnet

175
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,392
on your purview and ram it up
the shitter with a lubricated horse cock.

176
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,351
Your swearing does not impress me.

177
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,153
My husband works for Tower Hamlets
and believe me,

178
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,874
those kids make you sound like...
Angela Lansbury.

179
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,638
She's married? Poor bastard.

180
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:52,038
Malcolm, Judy's lubricated horse cock
aside for a second,

181
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,755
are you saying I'm now no longer
allowed to make media appearances?

182
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,599
Correct. Not until we can trust you
to keep the line.

183
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,234
I was going to keep to the line.
I was going to say,

184
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,669
I don't think war is unforeseeable...

185
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,598
- What is it, then?
- I dunno. Foreseeable? No.

186
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,518
No! Not foreseeable.
That's fucking declaring war.

187
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,437
Do you want to fucking declare war?

188
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,518
I'm a Cabinet minister.
I didn't get here by screwing up

189
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,756
every media appearance I ever had.

190
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,758
Write this down. It's neither
foreseeable nor unforeseeable.

191
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,633
Right, so not inevitable, but not...

192
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,751
You'd better walk on this fucking line.

193
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,279
..evitable.

194
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,029
You, hey, put the snifter out there
that if the BBC ambushes a minister

195
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,277
with another surprise question about
the war, I'll drop a bomb on them.

196
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,231
I can't do that, can l? That's political.

197
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,432
Does that not fit within your purview,
Marie Antoinette?

198
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,120
Why don't you just scuttle off back
to fucking Cranford

199
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,516
and play around with your tea and your
cakes and your fucking horse cocks.

200
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,189
Let them eat cock! Hey, you!
Ron Weasley, you do it.

201
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,269
No, no, you needn't worry about
the Canadians,

202
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,231
they're just happy to be there.

203
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,716
Yes, well, they always look surprised
when they're invited.

204
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,513
Shall I just give Toby a call
about this Simon Foster thing?

205
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,870
Yes, good idea.
No, I'm not talking to you.

206
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,991
Get me the Angolan chargé d'affaires.

207
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,475
Yes, well stop him playing football.

208
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,794
Hello.

209
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,876
So, how's it going? Found the bogs?

210
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,831
It's a bit...manic.

211
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:18,033
Never like this at Agriculture. People
tend not to get so sweary about wheat.

212
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,799
Sorry, Michael, do you mind
just turning it down a bit?

213
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,310
(classical music)
- Just a little bit...grating. Bloody music.

214
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,034
Listen,
I've got a bit of leg-up for you, actually.

215
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,517
Yeah. I think we can get Simon Foster
into the three o'clock with Karen Clark.

216
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,278
TOBY:
Karen Clark?

217
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,631
Was she the woman who went round
Britain in a coracle for leukaemia?

218
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,718
No, Toby. Karen Clark,
US Assistant Secretary of State.

219
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,593
Oh, right, Karen Clark. Wow, great.

220
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,280
- Michael wants to say something.
- Meat.

221
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,879
Meat?

222
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,039
His man is only going to be meat in
the room. No talking. He's just padding.

223
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,958
The Americans don't feel like
they're getting a proper meeting

224
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,514
unless there's 30 people on each side,

225
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,756
so he's basically like bulk in the room.

226
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,440
He's not exactly going to be relevant,
but he 'll be present.

227
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,198
I won't tell him that, to be honest.

228
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,517
- OK, I've got to go, darling. I love you.
- OK, yes, likewise.

229
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,232
Affirmative on that one.

230
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,555
All right, darling, take care, bye.

231
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,955
Can I turn it back up now?

232
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,878
You're on sexual health, aren't you?
That's ironic.

233
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,831
Right, Toby, quick tour.

234
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,520
- I should probably just go and...
- This is Mike.

235
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,279
Just leave it to Mike,
cos he knows what he's doing.

236
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,231
- Don't you, Mike?
- What?

237
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,715
Exactly. He's an idiot.

238
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,389
Listen, I understand your hostility
at new wood being brought in.

239
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,636
Sorry, that's the end of the tour,
I'm afraid.

240
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,719
There is really a lot of very important
people that you ought to know about,

241
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,558
but I have to...

242
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,237
- Toby, hi.
- All right, boss.

243
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,669
I'm sorry about earlier. Malcolm.

244
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,189
- He's a bit of an alpha male, isn't he?
- Yes.

245
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,117
Listen,

246
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,037
I was just um...

247
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,957
- Don't sit on Anna's desk.
- Sorry.

248
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:02,757
I have managed to get you into the big
Foreign Office meeting this afternoon.

249
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,394
The Karen Clark meeting?
Really? Shit.

250
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,999
How did you do that?

251
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,588
I did it through sheer bloody hard work.

252
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,358
- Judy?
- Yeah?

253
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,678
Tobes here has got me into the big
Karen Clark meeting this afternoon.

254
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,074
JUDY:
Oh!

255
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,031
The big "meat".

256
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,913
Impressive, eh?
How are you spelling that, by the way?

257
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,837
Two "E"s.

258
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,109
Oh, right.

259
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,037
TOBY:
Just one thing.

260
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:31,312
Talkingwise, you might find once
we get in there, that the bulk of it...

261
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,431
- Can we just wait for Judy?
- Of course.

262
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,516
Simon.

263
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,675
Michael, hi.

264
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,597
Hello. Welcome.

265
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,358
- Michael?
- Yes.

266
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,916
I'm Chad. We'd like a dual horseshoe
formation for the meeting set-up.

267
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,350
An enclave for Ms Clark. An enclave
for the Pentagon delegation.

268
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,516
And, politely, we request the presence

269
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,029
of both carbonated
and non-carbonated waters.

270
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,832
Right.

271
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,190
- Is that all?
- Yeah, that's it. Thank you so much.

272
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,232
Not at all. Wow, who was that?
Young Lankenstein?

273
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,993
He's probably running
something relatively major.

274
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,951
They're all kids in Washington.

275
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,799
It's like Bugsy Malone,
but with real guns.

276
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,832
(spoon tapping glass)

277
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,712
Thank you all for coming today

278
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,354
to the lnterim Anglo-American
Resources Forum.

279
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,232
I'd particularly like to welcome...

280
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,271
What's your view like?

281
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,834
- Well, it's pretty basic.
- OK, can we swap?

282
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,838
I don't want a consensus
forming around the premise

283
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:30,556
that military action is necessarily
the primary option at this point.

284
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,719
This paper which was authored
by one of my aides, Liza Weld...

285
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,752
Liza, I hope you don't mind
if I foreground this paper.

286
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,189
It's not strictly mypaper.

287
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,437
In the sense that you were the one
who put in the requests...

288
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,870
Miss Weld is very, very modest,
but this is her paper.

289
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,798
And she's highlighted several reasons

290
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,913
why we cannot envision a theatre
deployment for at least 1 2 months.

291
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,430
Should I say something? She invited
me. I should say something.

292
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,676
If you don't say something
in the first ten minutes,

293
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,756
then you might as well
not say anything at all.

294
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,836
I really think
you shouldn't say anything.

295
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,236
- No, I should say something.
- No, Simon, don't, just don't...

296
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,998
Don't pull my hand down.

297
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,873
The committee feels
a quicker deployment is possible.

298
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,194
Ah, which committee?

299
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,550
It was discussed
in a number of committees.

300
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,910
- If I mentioned one committee...
- You did.

301
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,837
..then it was a slip of the tongue.

302
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:23,509
What, because you've accidentally
alluded to a secret committee,

303
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,119
a war committee?

304
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,789
If I may intercept. I understand
we are rather pressed for time.

305
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,753
Liza, do you know if Linton
has set up a secret war committee?

306
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,996
- No. I have no idea.
- Get me on it.

307
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,271
I think it's worth noting
that ministers in the UK government,

308
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,517
such as our colleague here,
Simon Foster,

309
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:45,270
have made it very clear that they feel
currently war is unforeseeable.

310
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,039
Isn't that right, Simon?

311
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,877
Er...well, yes.

312
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,275
That's... That's what I said.

313
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,789
And I stick to what I said.

314
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,188
That doesn't mean that what I said
won't change...in the future.

315
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,117
Um...it's not immutable

316
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,071
or mutable.

317
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,077
It's... It's... It's...

318
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,031
It's a developing...

319
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,515
MlCHAEL: I think there are
areas of mutual discussion

320
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:17,519
that we could come onto now, and then
maybe if there's time left at the end...

321
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,632
Judy, can you just pass that on?
Is that fine?

322
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,558
Yes, that's all fine, thank you.

323
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,997
Right, come here. We need to talk.
What do you mean, "Stop being a tit?"

324
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,951
In what way was I being a tit?

325
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,832
Why am I even over here?

326
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,155
You were just meat in the room, Simon.

327
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,111
- Yeah...
- Meat in the room?

328
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,037
Yeah.

329
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,436
For fuck's sake, Judy, I've taken
an hour out to come over here

330
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,152
and be room meat.

331
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,111
Yes, but... but a prime cut,

332
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,673
you know, not offal.

333
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,677
Oh, great. I'm not liver.

334
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,631
What was l, tit meat?

335
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,591
Well, no, I just...

336
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,917
SlMON:
Come on. Let's get back.

337
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,837
- Hey, Liza.
- Hey.

338
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,236
I just want to say congratulations.
Your paper got a major citation.

339
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,828
You must be psyched
that Karen brought it up.

340
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,838
Yeah, well, that was,
you know, her call. Not mine.

341
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,075
You couldn't write a paper

342
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,272
that clashes more violently with
the current climate if you were trying.

343
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,038
It seems like you almost were trying.

344
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,232
- I wasn't trying! Believe me.
- You're like the woman in The Omen.

345
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,794
You've given birth to a demon
and now it's gonna kill you.

346
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,559
You probably identify
with the kid from The Omen.

347
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,989
See, you're an only child, aren't you?

348
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,917
I don't understand how my parents'

349
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,873
Iimited reproductive ability
reflects badly on me.

350
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,956
I'm the sperm that made it, so...

351
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,036
- Liza.
- I'm being called by our boss.

352
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,958
- OK, retreat. See you later.
- Yeah, have fun with yourself.

353
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,116
Have fun with your career kryptonite.

354
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,799
What's going on down there?
That looks important.

355
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,036
My teeth are killing me.
Are they chipped?

356
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,515
I think that one
has always been there, right?

357
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,029
It was a chip on the veneer.

358
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,357
- Don't look at my teeth for a long time.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

359
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,436
- It just surprised me.
TOBY: Liza!

360
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,595
Toby.

361
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,836
Toby! Hi.

362
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,791
- Hi.
- Give me a call!

363
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,309
- Yeah.
- OK.

364
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,989
Liza Weld. She did the
Kennedy Scholarship at my college.

365
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,918
- I had a little thing for her at the time.
- I can imagine, yeah.

366
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,031
Don't think she remembered me,
to be honest.

367
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,390
That is one
of the side-effects of Rohypnol.

368
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,670
Linton has set up
a secret war committee. I just know it.

369
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,837
I mean, Linton is an absolute lunatic,
Liza.

370
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,313
- He is dangerous.
- It's not good.

371
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,749
The voices in his head
now sing barbershop together.

372
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,551
I really, really hope there isn't a war,
it's going to be a nightmare.

373
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,240
It's bad enough having to cope
with the fucking Olympics.

374
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,555
- Minister?
- Just a quick word, sir?

375
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,399
This is your chance to nail the line.
Do you want to nail the line?

376
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,829
No, I'll freestyle it.
Hello, there. Hi.

377
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,871
So is war unforeseeable, Minister?

378
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,278
Look, all sorts of things,
that are actually very likely

379
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,391
are also unforeseeable.

380
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:55,913
For the plane in the fog,
the mountain is un... unforeseeable,

381
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:00,079
but then it is suddenly
very real and inevitable.

382
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,397
Is this your opinion or is this
the government position?

383
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,999
The mountain in the metaphor is

384
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,271
a completely hypothetical mountain
that could represent anything.

385
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,550
So, who is the plane,
and who is the mountain?

386
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,148
- Is the government lost in the fog?
- What I'm saying is...

387
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,191
that to walk the road of peace...

388
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:20,872
sometimes we need to be ready
to climb...the mountain of conflict.

389
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,638
Thank you so much.

390
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,070
Thank you. That's it,
ladies and gentlemen, thank you.

391
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,795
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,
why didn't we nail the line?

392
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,751
Simon, I did try to warn you.

393
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,758
Yes, you tried to warn me, but
you didn't actually stop me, did you?

394
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,598
I can't tackle you to the ground.

395
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,030
That's like shouting "Train!"
at somebody as they get hit by a train.

396
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,435
You should go "Train!
There's a fucking train!"

397
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,232
(mobile rings)
- Bollocks!

398
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,874
- Fuck, it's Malcolm.
- It's Malcolm for me, too.

399
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,831
How does he do that?

400
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,873
Simon, I don't like finding out about
people employed by this government

401
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,116
via the news, unless they've just died.

402
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,389
Be here, now.

403
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,317
The British Government
must be prepared

404
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,839
to climb the mountain of conflict.

405
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,110
It's unclear if his view
is shared by the Prime Minister.

406
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,073
TOBY:
Maybe we should get it out there.

407
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,272
Float the idea that the war
is a resigning issue for you.

408
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,437
You can't say it's a resigning issue,
because then you have to resign.

409
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,518
You're having a really great first day,
you know that?

410
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,200
You are supposed to be
a Cabinet minister!

411
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,039
You are supposed to be Officer Class!

412
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,958
Don't do this,
don't make fucking waves.

413
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,275
SlMON: We can do without
the ritual humiliation.

414
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,152
You know I'm against
talking up the war.

415
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,713
You're against talking up the war?

416
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,354
Is that why you said
"climb the mountain of conflict"?

417
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,913
Do you know what you sounded like?

418
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,235
A fucking Nazi Julie Andrews.

419
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:39,559
I'm just saying I might be forced
to the verge of making a stand.

420
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,636
A stand?

421
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,154
Right, The White Stripes, outside.

422
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,032
Uh-uh.

423
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,514
There's only two people
in The White Stripes.

424
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,991
I um...

425
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,438
I admire you.

426
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,311
I really do, I admire you.

427
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,317
Making a stand.

428
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,070
So, I take it, I can tell the PM that you...
you don't want to go to Washington?

429
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,316
- To where?
- To Washington.

430
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,908
See, the PM, he wants you...
Well, he wanted you

431
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,917
to go on a fact-finder, you know.

432
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,749
Problems we might have to face if it
all goes boombastic in the Middle East.

433
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,518
Oh, right.

434
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,632
But, you know, that's you,
you're on the verge, aren't you?

435
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,115
You're on the verge of your stand, so...

436
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,878
Well, Malcolm, come on,

437
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,912
I don't know what words I used
in the heat of the moment.

438
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,271
Maybe in a sense, yeah, I am on the
verge, but that's the important thing.

439
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,836
I'm on the verge.
I'm not in any way decided.

440
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,520
Christ on a bendy-bus.
Don't be such a fucking faff arse.

441
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,393
No, I'm standing my ground,
on the verge.

442
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,670
Right, OK,
well, when you go to America,

443
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,030
talk to Karen Clark
at the State Department, yeah?

444
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,072
- Right, OK. I'll give it a whirl.
- Keep away from Linton Barwick.

445
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,031
He's pushing the war
for Caulderwood's lot.

446
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,675
I'll deal with him. He uses a live hand
grenade as a fucking paper weight.

447
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,438
That's a true story.

448
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,676
Wow, I won't talk to him.

449
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,076
Talk to as few people as possible,
that would be best for you.

450
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,998
OK, Liza, the priorities are shower,
get me on Linton's war committee

451
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,351
and get me to a dentist,
not necessarily in that order.

452
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,152
Shower later.

453
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,510
What has Linton been up to
while we've been gone?

454
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,596
Have we declared war
on California yet?

455
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,278
Ah, Karen.

456
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,153
- How was London? Good meetings?
- Very good meetings.

457
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,431
You know we had some
great discussions there, I think our...

458
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,677
Thank you very much, and I will read
your words when they come through.

459
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,631
Thank you so much, Karen, hm. Bob.

460
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,716
You won't read the words, Linton.

461
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,632
Is Chad coming? Chad?

462
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,832
No, he's probably doing
his desperate chorus girl thing,

463
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:48,192
hanging around Linton's office,
trying to catch an eye, you know.

464
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,392
That's why he's wearing his
push-up bra today. Have you noticed?

465
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,239
- Assistant Secretary of State, hi.
- Brad, how are you?

466
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,998
- Chad.
- Yep, yep, yep, exactly.

467
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,918
- Can l...?
- Yep, you betcha, OK.

468
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,631
Hey, listen, the war committee.

469
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,591
What you have to do
is you've got to look for

470
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,917
the ten dullest-named committees
happening out of the executive branch.

471
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:10,555
Because Linton is not going to call it
the "Big Horrible War Committee".

472
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,752
He's gonna hide it
behind a name like "Diverse Strategy".

473
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,678
Something so dull
you're just gonna want to self-harm.

474
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,712
Get me General Miller
at the Pentagon, please.

475
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,796
My teeth hurt.

476
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,990
My teeth hurt like hell.

477
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,120
I'm sick of hearing about
the teeth, frankly.

478
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,039
Hi, yeah.
I'm checking the status on a paper

479
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,832
that was circulated by a staffer here.

480
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,439
It's called...

481
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:38,758
"Post War Planning. Parameters,
lmplications and Possibilities".

482
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,078
This is the one by...
this is the one by Liza Weld, right?

483
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,191
"PWlP PlP"?

484
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,231
Oh, God, it already has an acronym.

485
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,828
You know another acronym? DOA...

486
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,190
Your career.

487
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:58,111
My golly, I can't see why anyone would
choose to work in a glass office, huh?

488
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,994
Glass offices,
in my opinion, are for perverts.

489
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,917
I could request the glass be frosted.

490
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,792
Frosting is on cakes, huh?

491
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,753
Now, what else happened in London?

492
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,235
Ah, generally positive, two glitches...

493
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,839
Really, what?

494
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,394
Karen flagged a report
by one of her staffers.

495
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,230
She's obviously trying to use it as some
kind of roadblock. It's called PWlP PlP.

496
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,590
- PWlP what?
- PWlP PlP.

497
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,598
What is it, a report on bird calls?
What does it even stand for?

498
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,076
I can't recall. It's factish.
Intel for and against intervention.

499
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,988
We have all the facts on this we need.
We don't need any more facts.

500
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,156
In the land of truth, my friend...

501
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,230
..the man with one fact is the king.

502
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,113
You said there was something else,
what is that?

503
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,310
In the meeting with the Foreign Office,

504
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,557
the committee was accidentally
and briefly alluded to.

505
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,238
Which committee?

506
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,430
The... The war committee, sir.

507
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,518
All right,
Karen is not to know about this, huh?

508
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,030
She is an excitable, yapping she-dog.

509
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,628
Get a hold of those minutes.
I have to correct the record.

510
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,796
- We can do that?
- Yes, we can.

511
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,036
Those minutes are an aide-mémoire
for us.

512
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:08,711
They should not be a reductive record
of what happened to have been said,

513
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:12,628
but they should be more a full record of
what was intended to have been said.

514
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,558
I think that's the more accurate version,
don't you?

515
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,193
- Sir.
- Right.

516
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,754
I don't like this section, let's cut that.

517
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,677
Aye aye, sir.

518
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,119
Let's reverse this.

519
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,071
That was something Karen said, sir.

520
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,270
Well, it's not right, so let's change it.

521
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,073
- Aye, aye, sir.
- And... And I like...I like this.

522
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,792
Ah, thank you, sir.

523
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,309
Yeah, let's say
everyone agreed with that, huh?

524
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,592
So... So the car
will pick you up from the airport.

525
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,870
It's supposed to be
quite a good one, I believe.

526
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,753
The Americans are doing that.
I've just got the contact numbers.

527
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,836
What's she so fucking happy about?

528
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,837
She's probably just on a personal call.

529
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,757
(Judy laughs)

530
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,030
Why has she got control of the blinds?

531
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,149
I think it's...

532
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:57,796
I'm a government minister and
I don't have control of my own blinds.

533
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,959
I could order you some blinds. I could
order you some nice, heavy curtains,

534
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,196
with swags and a pelmet maybe.

535
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,788
Yes, do that.

536
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,672
OK.

537
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,551
Will you come with me?

538
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,639
So, listen...my team for the US,
Team Simon...

539
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:26,275
I'm thinking of taking you
and leaving Judy.

540
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,838
I could work with that, definitely.

541
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,552
Plus, she can be a bit, you know...

542
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,114
"Everything's a bit shit, isn't it?"
Like that.

543
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,958
Yeah, it's true. No, she can be,

544
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:39,073
"Oh, so you're the President and
I'm supposed to be impressed by that?"

545
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,078
"My husband works in Tower Hamlets.
Meh, meh, meh."

546
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,430
"Which is much harder
than being President."

547
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:48,109
Yeah, OK. Well, that's settled. Fuck it,
she's staying here. Go and tell her.

548
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,753
What?

549
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,997
KAREN: Well, that moves us on
to any other business.

550
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,510
I think I've flagged everything
that I need to discuss, as I usually do.

551
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,517
Everything you're preparedto discuss.

552
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,993
What is that? What are you doing?

553
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,669
I understand you've started a new
committee, Linton. What is that called?

554
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,153
What makes you think that?

555
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,396
It was mentioned
at our meeting in London.

556
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,794
Well, you must have misheard me.

557
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,150
No. I misheard the word "committee"?

558
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,157
Maybe it was another word.

559
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,077
Like, say, Khomeini.

560
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,431
- You're sitting on a new Khomeini?
- Possibly. There are a lot of words.

561
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,516
Kansas City. Kitty.

562
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,232
- ltty.
- "ltty?"

563
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,588
"ltty" is not a word, Bob.

564
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,234
- Commissary.
- Thank you, James...

565
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,555
Why don't you just recap for me,
at the moment,

566
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,910
all the committees
that you're currently sitting on?

567
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,919
I'm sorry, Karen, but you... you appear
to be bleeding from the teeth.

568
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,632
Let me see that. Holy Mother of...

569
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,149
Well, don't try to change the subject.

570
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,953
I'm sorry, everyone. I'm sorry.
Just ignore the blood.

571
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:46,197
- We haven't finished the meeting.
- I can't ignore...I'm sorry.

572
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,595
I don't mean to be rude,
but this is a tad repulsive.

573
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,030
I'm sorry. Excuse me.
Liza, come with me, I need you.

574
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,149
Chad, stay here.

575
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,874
Go, Buffy, you belong
to the vampire queen now.

576
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,797
- Liza.
- I'm coming.

577
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,673
Oh, my God. Shit! He's in there alone.

578
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,109
I cannot stand to see
a woman bleed from the mouth.

579
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,313
It reminds me of country and western
music, which I cannot abide. Huh?

580
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,193
That stuff is just choking the airwaves.

581
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,550
- Look, sorry, we just need...
- Oh, my God!

582
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,752
- It's really bad. It's really bad.
- I can't touch anything...

583
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,440
- Nobody was joking.
- It's... I need to catch it.

584
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,437
How far are you with the committees?

585
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,198
I've got it down to two, actually.

586
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,993
One is the "Aims and
Policy Alignment Committee".

587
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,190
The other is the
"Future Planning Committee".

588
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,629
It's not the first one,
because I set that up.

589
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,957
Does it really sound dull to you?
I thought it was a good name.

590
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,992
Right, no...it is a good name.

591
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:39,510
Well, find out if it really is the...
"Future Planning Committee".

592
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,631
Find out if it really is that.

593
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,309
Um...OK, well, I might go and do that.

594
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,113
You're not going to shout at me
if I go and do that, are you?

595
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,117
I'm not a monster, Liza. OK?

596
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,312
Will you stop implying
that I'm some kind of monster?

597
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,312
Bob!

598
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,237
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

599
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,069
I wanted to tell you
we're having this stupid

600
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,510
"hunk of the month of the office"
kind of contest.

601
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,349
And I just didn't want, you know,
you to feel objectified in any way,

602
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,630
- or anything like that.
- No, not at all.

603
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,274
And Karen knows about
the Future Planning Committee.

604
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,556
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

605
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,671
- No?
- No.

606
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,472
Excuse me.

607
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,114
Future Planning Committee,
that's what it is.

608
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,997
TOBY:
Wow!

609
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,951
This is fucking cool.

610
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,878
Don't be callow, Toby,
we're on official business.

611
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,434
- This way, gentlemen.
- Oh, thanks.

612
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,315
That was a little bit fucking cool.

613
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,759
Yep.

614
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,348
- Did you book a car?
- Me? No.

615
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,074
Well, Judy will have booked a car.

616
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,394
Judy?

617
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,715
- Hi.
- For fuck's sake!

618
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,637
I was wondering
what the car situation is?

619
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,638
It's Robbie's job to book it
and your job to check it.

620
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:08,196
There's obviously...
some snarl-up at her end, I think.

621
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,276
- "Simon Forester."
- Oh.

622
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,079
Thank you very much.

623
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,998
"England Government,
Simon Forester."

624
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,315
My name's Simon Foster,
it's British Government.

625
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,396
(siren)

626
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,833
Hey, Gav, I'm in a fucking motorcade.

627
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,313
Yeah.

628
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,793
I feel like we should have hookers,
do you know what I mean?

629
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,876
I mean in here...now.

630
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:43,279
- Do you want girls?
- No, no, no, no, no, no. Absolutely not.

631
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,153
No, sorry.
No hookers, it was just a joke.

632
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,274
I hate hookers. Not in
an aggressive way, but, no, thank you.

633
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,592
Strange hotel.

634
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,837
TOBY: It's like a hangar
for businessmen, isn't it?

635
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,797
- That's better, isn't it?
- It's big, yeah.

636
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,876
Just bring them here, that's fine.

637
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,440
Tobes, have you got any m...

638
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,796
Well, I haven't been to an ATM,
so I've not... I've only got English.

639
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,990
I mean,
I don't suppose English money is...

640
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,997
This and this, sorry that's...

641
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,076
TOBY:
It's usually a dollar a bag.

642
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,717
Ooh, well, there's the Capitol,

643
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,229
you can see there through
that window and that tree.

644
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,796
Technically,
you've got a Capitol Hill view.

645
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,071
(classical music)

646
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,510
Hi.

647
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,596
Excuse me.

648
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,153
Hello. How are you doing?

649
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,589
Was it something I said?
I haven't seen you in a month.

650
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,870
I haven't felt that in years. Thank you.

651
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,115
You're beautiful.

652
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,118
Oh, thank you.
I'm sure you say that to all the girls.

653
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,391
Yes, I do...
and some of the soldiers, too.

654
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,080
That's why you shouldn't
run for office, bimbo eruptions.

655
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,839
Come on, don't believe that shit.
I'm not gonna run for office.

656
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,235
I'm just trying to do something different.

657
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,998
It's one of the reasons I like you.

658
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,509
I know your passion
about education and housing and...

659
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,074
- Lingerie. Bestiality.
- There you go.

660
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,316
I'd forgotten about that.

661
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,590
Are you still allergic to the dog?

662
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,871
Yes, yes, I wake up and my eyes
are closed and my head is swollen

663
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,752
and I look like a giant ball sac.

664
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,518
Oh, my God. You know,

665
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,518
they do have modern medication
for that sort of thing.

666
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,710
- Beautiful ball sac, though.
- Thank you very much.

667
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,990
- How's the Pentagon?
- It's kicked up a little.

668
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,509
They're talking invasion
reasonably seriously.

669
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,756
Is there somewhere
we can talk about this?

670
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,711
- I don't know.
- There must be.

671
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,035
- I don't live here.
- Follow me.

672
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,958
- Go that way.
- Don't let people know we're leaving.

673
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,992
This is good. Her daughter's not home,
I talked to her.

674
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,917
- In here?
- Yeah.

675
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,749
Although, I don't know what we'll say
if somebody comes in right now.

676
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,155
No, I can't think
of a good possible excuse, no.

677
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,838
No, me neither, me neither.

678
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,552
- What?
- Come here.

679
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,591
Just be careful, don't mess stuff up.

680
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,030
- Oh, come on, it's toys.
- Let's sit down.

681
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,116
- So...
- Yeah.

682
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,752
Not enough troops.

683
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,996
Total minimum
European Theatre requirement.

684
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,951
The Far East, Asia.

685
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,514
- OK. That's how many we have?
- Total there, yes.

686
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,870
And then we have the contingency
already deployed.

687
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,877
OK, I don't... You've lost me.

688
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,070
Hold on a minute...

689
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,031
Oh, fuck this.

690
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,718
What?

691
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,198
TOY:
* La la la, la la la la, la la la.

692
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,355
Good.

693
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,040
Your military hardware
is impressive, General.

694
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,116
Yeah, well, not any more, it isn't.

695
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,879
- So, you add these together.
(toy sound effects)

696
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:47,398
So this is the number of combat troops
available for an invasion,

697
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,919
according to these figures.

698
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,519
TOY:
12!

699
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,198
Thousand?

700
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,117
No, 1 2. 1 2 troops.

701
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,753
Oh, come on, you're shitting me?

702
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,236
I am shitting you.
1 2,000 troops, 1 2,000 troops,

703
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:04,114
but that's not enough...
that's the amount that are going to die.

704
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,834
And at the end of a war
you need some soldiers left, really,

705
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,678
or else it looks like you've lost.

706
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,711
TOY:
Bye, for now.

707
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,513
You know what? I've got some Brits
I have to meet tomorrow.

708
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,198
A guy named Simon Foster.

709
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,958
Who's Simon Foster?

710
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,390
He's this guy that said publicly
that war was unforeseeable.

711
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,239
And I think he could be very useful
on the war committee.

712
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,920
He can internationalise the dissent,
start to.

713
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,793
You're going to use him
as a little meat puppet?

714
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,157
Tobes...hi.

715
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,077
Hi.

716
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,919
What are we gonna...do tonight?

717
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,672
Gonna do tonight?

718
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:56,509
Yes, what are we up to, my...
my chief aide...?

719
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,234
Well...yeah, I mean,
I sort of thought tonight

720
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,113
we'd probably be just a bit tired, really.

721
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,677
No, I am tired.
But I'm also a career politician, Toby,

722
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:10,270
in the political powerhouse of the world
for 48 hours,

723
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:14,518
and I thought it might be nice to go out
rather than just sitting in my room

724
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,074
trying to spank one out
over a shark documentary,

725
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,792
because I'm scared if I watch a porno

726
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:22,151
it'll end up in
the register of members' interests. So...

727
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,312
What have you got...for us to do?

728
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,159
Right, what have I got?
Well, so far we've got...

729
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,078
Well, there's a leaflet through the door

730
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,510
for happy hour at the bar
which might be interesting.

731
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,590
Also I do have the number of a guy

732
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:41,315
I was at uni with
who works for CNN out here.

733
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,396
- No.
- No?

734
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,189
- Where are you?
- I'm waving at you.

735
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,912
I don't see you, be more visible.

736
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:53,635
I'm, like, practically on top of you, I'm
coming to you, is what I'm going to do.

737
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,876
You can stop talking
on your cellphone now.

738
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,638
Of course I can.

739
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,274
Look, I have to leave.
Phone Simon Foster's guy.

740
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,311
Tell them, come to the war committee.

741
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,000
I'll give them some face time
tomorrow around ten o'clock.

742
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,157
It'll be coffee and Danish.
Tea. They'll want tea.

743
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,919
Tea and sympathy,
tea and a hand job, whatever.

744
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,432
..great deal that is unknown
about hammerhead sharks,

745
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,834
such as their mating habits.

746
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,235
You can definitely spot
the female ones.

747
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,389
Hello.

748
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,557
Hi, Toby, what are you doing tonight?

749
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:27,433
Well, no, it's unbelievably hectic.
Actually we're...

750
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,516
Their courtship is a violent affair.

751
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:32,871
The male will bite the female
until she acquiesces.

752
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,753
The war committee, that's a big thing,
Liza.

753
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,838
Yeah, well,
I have been on committees before,

754
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,509
the Challenges For The Cheese
Market, that was one of the big ones.

755
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,995
Yeah, God, yeah. Love a drink.

756
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,315
40 minutes is perfect, yeah, yeah.

757
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,795
Bye-bye. Bye. Bye. Bye, bye.

758
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,991
- Matty, how's CNN?
- Great.

759
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,758
I can't, mate, no.

760
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:59,395
Liza Weld has got us onto the Future
Planning Committee in the morning.

761
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,909
The "war committee"
to the likes of you and me.

762
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,632
What are you talking about?

763
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,957
The Future Planning Committee
is Linton's war committee.

764
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:10,311
Do you not work for CN N
or is it the Cartoon News Network?

765
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,271
(knocking at door)

766
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,356
(continued knocking)

767
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,514
Come in.
I just wasn't expecting to see you here.

768
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,029
Physically here.
Obviously you're always in my heart.

769
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:24,118
I'm here, I'm there, I'm fucking
everywhere, I'm the egg man.

770
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,515
Have you come to insult me
in a different time zone?

771
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,155
Yeah. No, sorry, I'm just off out
for a drink with her just now.

772
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:33,192
No. You're barking up
the wrong cock there, my friend.

773
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,959
Little Toby is staying very much
in his hammock this evening.

774
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,991
- Simon, I've got us on the...
- Hiya.

775
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,076
Jesus Christ, fucking hell, Malcolm.

776
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,589
You're supposed to shit yourself
in there, not out here.

777
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,952
I've got us on Linton's Future Planning
Committee for tomorrow morning.

778
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,275
Brilliant. What is that?

779
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,197
It's the war committee.

780
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,993
What? The actual war...
the actual war committee?

781
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:57,510
- Who's going to be there?
- Karen Clark, Liza Weld,

782
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,437
me and Simon...

783
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,357
Simon and me.

784
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,074
How about the rest of the committee,
who are they going to be?

785
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,509
Jimmy Osmond, Gwyneth Paltrow?
It's a diversion.

786
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,154
The real committee,
that's happening at the White House.

787
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,589
I'll text you the details,
because I'm going to go out

788
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:14,154
for a drink with
some State Department bods just now.

789
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,238
Don't mention this to the press, OK?
Don't mention it to anyone.

790
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:20,079
If the press get a whiff
that there's a war committee

791
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,316
even a cardboard one,
every fucker in this town

792
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,237
is gonna turn up and try and get on it.

793
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:27,113
So no matter what gay bar
you end up in, keep it shtoom.

794
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,952
SlMON:
I was watching that.

795
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,230
Yeah, well,
I have to have a word with you.

796
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,590
You might want
to slip into your negligee.

797
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,516
(heavy rock music)

798
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,750
- You see this mosh pit?
- Yeah.

799
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:47,270
Well, they're mostly house staffers,
senators' interns.

800
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,597
Tonight they rage hard,
but tomorrow they go back to the Hill

801
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,678
and argue noise-reduction legislation.

802
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,673
- Is this yours or mine?
- I don't know, I've got three.

803
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,711
So one of these has got to be yours.

804
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,957
Those are like fluids that I've never...
would you call wax a fluid?

805
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,991
No, it's not a fluid, it's more of a...

806
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,839
- It's very intimate.
- It's an ooze...it's an ooze.

807
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,916
Ooo...eugh!

808
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:19,159
Karen will want you to say
"War is unforeseeable."

809
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,955
And Linton will want you to talk up the
"climbing the mountain of conflict" line.

810
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,911
You say nothing, OK?

811
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,589
You stay detached, otherwise
that's what I will do to your retinas.

812
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,551
Right. Can I go to bed now, please?

813
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,636
No, no, no, no.
We're going to stay here

814
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,149
and you are going to rehearse
saying nothing.

815
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,838
Am I being tortured?

816
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,918
TOBY:
You look worried.

817
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,157
It's the paper that I wrote for Karen.

818
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:47,158
It's called PWlP PlP, it's about war.

819
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,352
The pros and cons,
and I came up with too many cons.

820
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,948
I'm, like, fucking worried because...

821
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:56,231
this is, like, my career on the line.

822
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,431
I thought you were worried,
because you were looking worried.

823
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:04,519
But you know, don't...
I mean, don't... don't worry.

824
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,197
- Thank you.
- OK.

825
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,276
- Sure.
- Thank you.

826
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,671
LlZA:
God damn it!

827
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,192
TOBY: Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm just taking off my shoes.

828
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,197
Why is that? Is it a mosque?

829
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,151
It's just, like...

830
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,077
Is it... Is it a bouncy castle?

831
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,156
(laughter)

832
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,072
(kissing)

833
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,270
Can I just say,
what happens in Washington,

834
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,356
stays in Washington, yeah?

835
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:41,552
Well, I live in Washington, so that
doesn't, like, really work for me.

836
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,599
TOBY:
Yeah?

837
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,838
A number for a cab company
in Washington DC, please.

838
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,511
Just straight through, straight through.
Hi, I need a cab.

839
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:12,993
Well, I don't know.
I'm outside number 1 427, moving on...

840
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,588
I don't know,
it's a nice street, it's quite leafy,

841
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,676
federal houses.

842
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,798
Marcel's is nice.

843
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,512
I like their wraps.

844
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,950
And you should go to La Taverna,
the Greek place, that's fantastic.

845
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,116
They do that thing
where they set fire to the cheese.

846
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,912
What's that called? It's a lot of fun.

847
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,110
Yes, it sounds fun.

848
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,991
And, well, there's the Aerospace
Museum and the National Gallery.

849
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,076
Do they set fire to the pictures?

850
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,511
Yeah.

851
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:57,192
Hi, sorry I'm so late for the meeting.
One or two issues getting here, but...

852
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,276
- I'm Karen.
- Hi. Toby.

853
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,879
Pull an all-nighter?

854
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:06,229
- Well, l... I was led astray.
- Oh. By who?

855
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:11,638
I... I just ran into some people
from the MoD and...

856
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,512
Not Penny Grayling?

857
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,278
No.

858
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,153
Another...gang.

859
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:21,033
Wow, I didn't realise we had
so many delegations in town.

860
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,754
No, well..."The British are coming!"

861
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,112
So...

862
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:34,676
Yeah, you know what? I have a lot
of things to check on just now.

863
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,156
So this would probably be
a good place to break things up.

864
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,429
No problem.

865
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,629
Brilliant.

866
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,318
Bye.

867
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,430
I've brought your bag for you.

868
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,559
Cheers, man.

869
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,558
Tobes, I don't want to have to
read you the riot act here,

870
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:56,070
but I am going to have to read you
some extracts from the riot act.

871
00:40:56,200 --> 00:41:00,955
Like section one, paragraph one: don't
leave your boss twisting in the wind,

872
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:05,676
and then burst in late
smelling like a pissed seaside donkey.

873
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,074
(lamely): "The British are coming."

874
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,760
All right, I was late for the meeting.
I am sorry,

875
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,348
but it's not like I threw up in there, is it?

876
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,436
No, you're right, I'm being unfair.

877
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,918
I should be thanking you
for not throwing up.

878
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:23,510
Well done, you're a star.
You didn't wet yourself, did you?

879
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:27,189
You're in the right city.
You didn't say anything overtly racist.

880
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,993
You didn't pull your dick out
and start plucking it

881
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,429
and shouting, "Willy banjo."

882
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,676
No, I'm being really unfair.

883
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,634
You'd got so much right
without actually being there

884
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:42,309
for the beginning of one of the
most important moments of my career.

885
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,033
Thanks, you're a legend.

886
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:55,835
That was just the beginning, do you
think? Are we going back in there?

887
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,518
I don't know, we barely said hello.

888
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,358
I've had muggings
that lasted longer.

889
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,675
All we talked about
was flammable cheese.

890
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:05,839
TOBY: What if our meeting has
finished? What if Karen comes back,

891
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,791
and then we're still sitting here?

892
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,754
It's going to be embarrassing, isn't it?
We're going to look like groupies.

893
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,518
What if the meeting hasn't finished?

894
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,437
And she comes back
and we've disappeared?

895
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,312
Maybe I could call Judy? She could...

896
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,876
Please can we try
and just do one thing without Judy?

897
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:21,830
Fine.

898
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:28,718
I think we've drawn long enough
from that...teat.

899
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,508
Surprisingly enough, a lot of the marble
in the building is not imported.

900
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,551
- Really?
- It's really interesting...

901
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,319
- If you study the stonework...
- Not at the moment.

902
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,317
So, you made it in OK, right?

903
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,829
Yeah, hunky-dory, thanks.
Can I get a coffee?

904
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,632
Sure, sure.

905
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,469
If we just get started, my assistant
should be bringing in coffee shortly.

906
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,437
Your assistant?

907
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,949
Yeah. So, item.

908
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:58,311
We need to have a conversation about
the mood of the British Parliament,

909
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,795
the bumps in the road ahead
and what not.

910
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:05,357
I'm sorry, I don't...
This situation here is... is this it?

911
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:07,675
No offence, son,
but you look like you should still be

912
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,950
at school with your head down
a fucking toilet.

913
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:13,675
Your first point there, the offence?
I'm afraid I'm going to have to take it.

914
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,395
Your second point, I'm 22, but item,
it's my birthday in nine days, so...

915
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,193
if it will make you feel more
comfortable, we could wait.

916
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,151
Don't get sarcastic with me, son.

917
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:25,158
We burned this tight-arsed city
to the ground in 1 81 4.

918
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,239
And I'm all for doing it again,
starting with you, you frat fuck.

919
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,112
You get sarcastic with me again

920
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,913
and I will stuff so much cotton wool
down your fucking throat

921
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,600
it'll come out your arse
like the tail on a Playboy bunny.

922
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,349
I was led to believe
I was attending the war committee.

923
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,711
Yes, Assistant Secretary of State
Linton Barwick asked me to brief you

924
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:46,149
on the work of
the Future Planning Committee.

925
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,111
I'm away.

926
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,515
And here we are.
The fucking Vice President

927
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,551
has also graced us with his presence.

928
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,636
Give him a bottle of milk.

929
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,557
You didn't wake me up.

930
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:59,717
The thought crossed my mind,
but you just looked so sweet there.

931
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,637
You know, with the jet lag and all.

932
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,149
I don't know, I thought
you knew what you were doing.

933
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:07,113
Well, no. Obviously I didn't know
what I was doing, I was asleep.

934
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:10,038
That's how people walk through
windows, that's how that happens.

935
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,116
Hey, Liza? I've got another call

936
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:15,232
for you about the committee
from Senator Crudden's office.

937
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,316
Crudden? What is going on?

938
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,590
I mean, how did CNN
know about the committee?

939
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:23,349
Did Linton post, like,
an invite on Facebook or something?

940
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:26,950
Liza? Everyone is so hot for this paper,
I just wanted to let you know.

941
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,877
I'm about to run off another ten copies.

942
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,798
- Just stop.
- It's like a Harry Potter book,

943
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,639
if Harry Potter
made people really, really angry.

944
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:37,274
You're in hot water,
you're lobsterising.

945
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,960
Do you smell lobster?
Because I smell lobster.

946
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:43,152
Strong...bisque wafting this way.

947
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,157
How far would you go with Linton?

948
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,111
You freaky little stalker.

949
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:50,312
Downtown?
Or all the way up Brokeback Mountain?

950
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,715
Smells like bisque. Smells like bisque.

951
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,398
(mobile rings)

952
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:03,034
Where's the war committee?
I thought I was going.

953
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,993
Simon's going. I thought
you were doing your one-to-one?

954
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,599
Where the fuck is it happening?

955
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:10,359
It's in the State Department
on the seventh floor.

956
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,232
- Malcolm?
- What?

957
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:15,875
Do you like how I'm telling you
what's going on where you are?

958
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,514
Let me tell you what's going on
where you are, sweetheart.

959
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,234
A certain vinegar-faced,
manipulative cowbag is about

960
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,112
to discover that she's out of a fucking...

961
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:27,074
job. Fucking hung up, haven't you?
You fucking hoity-toity fucking...

962
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,509
Hey, buddy?
Enough with the curse words, all right?

963
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:32,359
Kiss my sweaty balls, you fat fuck.

964
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,514
- There's the grenade.
- I know, I'm looking at it.

965
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:40,916
He's got "Climb the mountain
of conflict" on his picture.

966
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,996
TOBY:
He's picked up on that?

967
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,996
I'm a bumper sticker.

968
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,997
Shit, there's Karen Clark.

969
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,838
Have a meeting, have a meeting.

970
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,990
What about the dialectic, as it spreads
across the different territories?

971
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,076
- lnteresting dialectic...
- Oh, hi.

972
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,509
Hi. I'll see you at the committee.

973
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,676
We're just sorting out a bit of prep...

974
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,995
Very good, that's great.

975
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:09,157
- Liza. They're still here.
- I know. I told them where it was.

976
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,793
OK, let's go, let's go. Come on.

977
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:13,832
Quick, we've got to keep up
with them, now. Let's roll.

978
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:16,838
No, you can't say "let's roll",
they don't like it here.

979
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:20,669
That's just who asked to be in
on the committee, it's crazy.

980
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,268
- Yeah.
- Hello.

981
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,312
Are you joining us
or shall we see you there?

982
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,158
Oh, I'm so sorry. No, see you there.

983
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,953
I don't need to do any of the things

984
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,833
that you need to go in there to do,
so I'll just see you there.

985
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,916
- Toby, do you need to use the...?
- No, no, no.

986
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:38,838
- I don't need the restroom.
- All right, OK.

987
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,791
Yeah, they're insane.

988
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,751
Where is it?

989
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,711
I don't know. We can wait here.

990
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:49,196
Wait round here. When they come out,
we'll follow them again.

991
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,632
Plenty of room down the back.

992
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:03,231
We seem to be
overrun with insurgents, Bob, huh?

993
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,794
BOB: There must have been a leak.
- Really, no kidding?

994
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:09,754
- Unbelievable!
- Is this the wrestling? Is that the ring?

995
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,279
There's General Miller.

996
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:15,598
I think it's best that we move,
reconvene to a bigger, a larger venue.

997
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,995
- If you follow my lead...
- Take an agenda.

998
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,554
Please take an agenda,
we want to stick to that.

999
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:24,559
KAREN: This is a cluster fuck.
How did CNN know about this?

1000
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:27,752
- Hold onto that one!
- Could you get Miller to sign it?

1001
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:30,838
If we could do this
with a certain amount of energy.

1002
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,791
Just this way, folks.

1003
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,876
Moo!

1004
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,950
Find a chair,
wherever you're comfortable.

1005
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:44,513
More this way.

1006
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,995
Excellent. I'm room meat again.

1007
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:50,829
This is a massive abattoir
of room meat.

1008
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:54,508
Just so you know,
Karen and I did not appreciate

1009
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,756
having to skulk around
like Mulder and Scully

1010
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,518
to find out about the committee.

1011
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,677
Well, you're both here now, huh,
John and Yoko?

1012
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,358
We need to talk.

1013
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:06,233
How about my office,
1 2:30 tomorrow, huh?

1014
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,759
OK, off you go.

1015
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:10,155
- What do you mean?
- I've got this covered.

1016
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:13,670
Go and find the next thing. Talk to that
Chad boy, the boy from The Shining.

1017
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,119
He knows things.

1018
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:18,152
- Don't make me pump Chad.
- No, I'm making you pump Chad.

1019
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,635
Go on, it'll be easy-peasey
lemon-squeezy.

1020
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:25,276
No, it won't. It'll be difficult, difficult,
lemon difficult, that is what it'll be.

1021
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,595
Have a lovely afternoon.
Stop a war for me.

1022
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:31,508
So, welcome
to the somewhat engorged

1023
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:34,632
session of
the Future Planning Committee.

1024
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:37,354
KAREN:
Yes, Assistant Secretary, on point six,

1025
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:41,029
it feels like there's already been
an assumption that we're invading

1026
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:45,790
and don't you think that we should
discuss the practical implications?

1027
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,593
I mean, this is,
after all, the war committee.

1028
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,109
This is the Future Planning Committee.

1029
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:54,152
Well, unofficially,
it is called the war committee.

1030
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:57,636
Well, Karen, unofficially,
we can call anything whatever we want.

1031
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:02,311
I mean, unofficially, this is a shoe, but
it's not, Karen, it is a glass of water.

1032
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:05,512
And this is
the Future Planning Committee.

1033
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:08,393
Well, unofficially,
this appears to be bullshit.

1034
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:12,515
Hey.

1035
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,790
- What's all this?
- "Climb the mountain of conflict!"

1036
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:17,514
We're just choosing a font
for what looks appropriate.

1037
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:19,392
What about that font the SS used?

1038
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,511
Have you thought about
using that one?

1039
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:23,756
Er...well,
that obviously has bad connotations.

1040
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:25,677
Heavy metal?

1041
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,597
- No, the SS.
- Oh, right.

1042
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:37,036
Has a decision already been made,
in principle, to advocate invasion?

1043
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:39,310
I would refer you
to the recent comments

1044
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:44,150
of our colleague from the UK,
Mr Simon Foster, in that regard.

1045
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:48,717
Yes, I think that Mr Foster
would have something to say to that.

1046
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,993
I'm... I'm certainly hearing both sides.

1047
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:57,831
In England we have a saying
for a situation such as this,
