1
00:00:00,228 --> 00:00:02,708
Hello. My name is Marty DiBergi.

2
00:00:02,868 --> 00:00:06,188
I'm a filmmaker.
I make a lot of commercials.

3
00:00:06,348 --> 00:00:10,988
That dog that chases the covered wagon
underneath the sink? That was mine.

4
00:00:12,068 --> 00:00:14,468
In 1966,

5
00:00:14,588 --> 00:00:19,148
I went down to Greenwich Village
to a rock club called The Electric Banana.

6
00:00:19,308 --> 00:00:23,948
Don't look for it. It's not there any more.
But that night, I heard a band

7
00:00:24,108 --> 00:00:27,148
that, for me,
redefined the word "rock'n'roll".

8
00:00:27,788 --> 00:00:33,228
I remember being knocked out by their...
their exuberance, their raw power,

9
00:00:33,388 --> 00:00:35,428
and their punctuality.

10
00:00:35,588 --> 00:00:39,148
That band was Britain's
now legendary Spinal Tap.

11
00:00:40,108 --> 00:00:46,268
17 years and 15 albums later,
Spinal Tap is still going strong.

12
00:00:46,428 --> 00:00:51,748
And they've earned a place in rock history
as one of England's loudest bands.

13
00:00:51,868 --> 00:00:54,388
So in the late fall of 1982,

14
00:00:54,508 --> 00:00:58,508
when I heard that Tap was releasing
a new album called Smell The Glove

15
00:00:58,668 --> 00:01:02,828
and was planning a tour of the US
to promote that album,

16
00:01:02,988 --> 00:01:06,588
I jumped at the chance
to make the documentary,

17
00:01:06,748 --> 00:01:10,988
the, if you will, rockumentary
that you're about to see.

18
00:01:11,148 --> 00:01:16,388
I wanted to capture the sights,
the sounds, the smells

19
00:01:16,548 --> 00:01:19,508
of a hard-working rock band on the road.

20
00:01:19,668 --> 00:01:21,588
And I got that.

21
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,428
But I got more.

22
00:01:23,588 --> 00:01:25,708
A lot more.

23
00:01:25,868 --> 00:01:29,748
But enough of my yakkin'.
Whaddaya say? Let's boogie.

24
00:01:39,388 --> 00:01:41,228
Gives me energy. Makes me happy.

25
00:01:41,388 --> 00:01:43,028
Heavy metal's deep.

26
00:01:43,188 --> 00:01:45,148
The way they dress, the leather.

27
00:01:45,308 --> 00:01:50,228
- Is this La Guardia?
- No, this is JFK. New York, New York.

28
00:01:54,388 --> 00:01:56,108
Watch its mouth!

29
00:02:07,268 --> 00:02:12,428
It's like you become one with the guys
in the band. I mean, there's no division.

30
00:02:12,588 --> 00:02:14,428
You just...

31
00:02:14,588 --> 00:02:19,268
The music just unites people...
with the players.

32
00:02:19,388 --> 00:02:23,708
Comin' live, direct from hell... Spinal Tap!

33
00:02:24,348 --> 00:02:28,068
You're hot, you take all we've got.
Not a dry seat in the house

34
00:02:29,148 --> 00:02:31,028
Next day we'll be on our way

35
00:02:31,188 --> 00:02:33,508
- But tonight I'm gonna rock you
- Tonight I'm gonna rock you

36
00:02:33,668 --> 00:02:35,988
- Yeah, tonight I'm gonna rock you
- Tonight I'm gonna rock you

37
00:02:36,148 --> 00:02:37,388
Tonight!

38
00:02:42,468 --> 00:02:46,948
We are Spinal Tap from the UK!
You must be the USA!

39
00:02:50,468 --> 00:02:53,788
DAVID ST HUBBINS

NIGEL TUFNEL

00:03:01,268 --> 00:03:03,828
DEREK SMALLS

VIV SAVAGE
Keyboards

44
00:03:13,868 --> 00:03:17,588
Little girl, it's a great big world
but there's only one of

45
00:03:19,228 --> 00:03:22,028
Me!

46
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:42,908
Let's talk about your history.

47
00:03:43,068 --> 00:03:49,108
Nigel, you and David originally started
the band back in... when was it, 1964?

48
00:03:49,268 --> 00:03:53,188
Before that I was in a group
called The Creatures-a skiffle group.

49
00:03:53,348 --> 00:03:56,228
I was in Lovely Lads,
and then we looked at each other

50
00:03:56,348 --> 00:03:59,508
and said we might as well join up,
you know?

51
00:04:00,308 --> 00:04:04,508
So we became The Originals.
And we had to change our name.

52
00:04:04,668 --> 00:04:07,628
There was another group
called The Originals

53
00:04:07,788 --> 00:04:11,148
- And we had to rename ourselves.
- The New Originals.

54
00:04:11,308 --> 00:04:15,108
- Then they became...
- They changed back to The Regulars,

55
00:04:15,268 --> 00:04:18,708
so we could've been The Originals,
but what's the point?

56
00:04:18,868 --> 00:04:21,148
We became
The Thames Men at that point.

57
00:04:22,948 --> 00:04:24,268
Stop wastin' my time

58
00:04:24,428 --> 00:04:26,268
"POP, LOOK & LISTEN"
(British TV - 1965)

59
00:04:26,428 --> 00:04:28,348
You know what I want

60
00:04:29,668 --> 00:04:31,628
You know what I need

61
00:04:33,228 --> 00:04:34,828
Or maybe you don't

62
00:04:36,508 --> 00:04:40,988
Do I have to come right flat out
and tell you everythin'?

63
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:43,428
Gimme some money

64
00:04:44,308 --> 00:04:46,788
Gimme some money

65
00:04:53,588 --> 00:04:55,108
Your first drummer was...

66
00:04:55,268 --> 00:04:58,508
- The Peeper.
- John "Stumpy" Pepys. Great, great...

67
00:04:58,668 --> 00:05:01,588
Tall, blond geek with glasses.

68
00:05:02,988 --> 00:05:05,708
- Good drummer.
- Great look. Good drummer.

69
00:05:05,868 --> 00:05:08,148
- What happened to him?
- He died.

70
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,868
He died in a bizarre gardening accident
some years back.

71
00:05:12,028 --> 00:05:13,948
It was one of those things.

72
00:05:14,108 --> 00:05:16,188
It was... the authorities said

73
00:05:16,348 --> 00:05:20,148
best leave it, you know, unsolved,
really, you know?

74
00:05:20,308 --> 00:05:23,948
- And he was replaced by?
- Stumpy Joe. Eric "Stumpy Joe" Childs.

75
00:05:24,108 --> 00:05:26,388
And what happened to Stumpy Joe?

76
00:05:26,548 --> 00:05:28,988
Well, it's not a very pleasant story.

77
00:05:29,148 --> 00:05:32,228
- But, er... he died.
- He passed on.

78
00:05:32,388 --> 00:05:38,708
He choked on... The official explanation
was he choked on vomit.

79
00:05:38,868 --> 00:05:43,748
- And he passed away.
- It was actually someone else's vomit.

80
00:05:43,908 --> 00:05:45,828
There's no real...

81
00:05:45,988 --> 00:05:48,148
They can't prove whose vomit it was.

82
00:05:48,308 --> 00:05:51,068
They don't have facilities
in Scotland Yard.

83
00:05:51,228 --> 00:05:53,468
You can't really dust for vomit.

84
00:05:54,468 --> 00:05:56,388
Here we go.

85
00:05:56,788 --> 00:06:00,108
- SoHo, they call this. SoHo.
- So-what?

86
00:06:01,548 --> 00:06:05,988
OPENING NIGHT PARTY
New York City

87
00:06:06,148 --> 00:06:08,788
How are you?!

88
00:06:08,948 --> 00:06:12,068
lan... Hi, fellas!

89
00:06:12,228 --> 00:06:13,908
How ya doin'?

90
00:06:14,068 --> 00:06:16,028
I want you to meet everybody.

91
00:06:16,188 --> 00:06:18,108
- Bobbi Flekman.
- Who's that?

92
00:06:18,268 --> 00:06:22,188
- Bobbi Flekman.
- Who is it? With the record company?

93
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:26,548
Yes, Bobbi Flekman!
The hostess with the mostest!

94
00:06:26,748 --> 00:06:28,428
You know! You know!

95
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:31,148
Hi, handsome. How ya doin'?

96
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:35,548
I want you to all meet Sir Denis
Eton-Hogg. He's the head of Polymer.

97
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:38,628
You don't talk so much.
Just smile and look smart.

98
00:06:38,788 --> 00:06:41,188
Denis, come here! Come here.

99
00:06:41,348 --> 00:06:43,988
I want you to meet Spinal Tap,
our guests of honour.

100
00:06:44,148 --> 00:06:47,148
- How very nice to meet you.
- This is Sir Denis Eton-Hogg.

101
00:06:47,308 --> 00:06:51,708
- This is Nigel.
- Thanks a lot for letting us... er...

102
00:06:51,868 --> 00:06:54,828
Let's go over here
and we'll take a picture.

103
00:06:54,988 --> 00:06:59,628
Where's my photographer? Come here,
honey. What's your name? Christine?

104
00:06:59,788 --> 00:07:02,428
OK, right over here.

105
00:07:03,148 --> 00:07:04,708
Good! Good!

106
00:07:04,868 --> 00:07:08,428
- He's not into Negro music.
- No, it's not Negro.

107
00:07:08,588 --> 00:07:12,788
Guys, you look fantastic.
You would never know you're almost 40.

108
00:07:12,948 --> 00:07:15,908
If I looked this good
from the stage, too-it's amazing.

109
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:17,828
- I did the bird.
- Do the dead bird.

110
00:07:17,988 --> 00:07:19,668
Get the dwarf cannolies.

111
00:07:19,828 --> 00:07:23,468
- I did the bird.
- Don't talk back. Mime is money. Move it!

112
00:07:23,628 --> 00:07:27,428
Now, we here at Polymer,
we're all looking forward to a long

113
00:07:27,588 --> 00:07:30,468
and fruitful relationship with Spinal Tap.

114
00:07:30,628 --> 00:07:34,468
We wish them great success
on their North American tour.

115
00:07:34,628 --> 00:07:39,148
And so say all of us - Tap into America!

116
00:07:44,468 --> 00:07:47,628
Excuse me.
Are you reading Yes, I Can?

117
00:07:47,788 --> 00:07:50,548
- Yeah. Have you read it?
- Yeah. By Sammy Davis, Jr?

118
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:51,548
Yeah.

119
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:54,188
You know what the title
of that book should be?

120
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:58,228
Yes, I Can... If Frank Sinatra Says It's OK.

121
00:07:58,388 --> 00:08:00,588
Cos Frank calls the shots
for all those guys.

122
00:08:00,748 --> 00:08:04,788
Did you get to the part yet where
Sammy's comin' outta The Copa,

123
00:08:04,948 --> 00:08:08,668
and it's about three o'clock
in the morning, and he sees Frank.

124
00:08:08,828 --> 00:08:11,748
Frank's walkin' down Broadway
by himself...

125
00:08:13,908 --> 00:08:16,228
Fuckin' limeys.

126
00:08:16,388 --> 00:08:19,548
Well, they're not used to that world,
and Frank Sinatra.

127
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,948
It's a different world that they're in.

128
00:08:22,108 --> 00:08:26,868
You know, it's just people like this,
you know... They get all they want,

129
00:08:27,028 --> 00:08:30,348
so they don't really understand
about a life like Frank's.

130
00:08:30,508 --> 00:08:33,668
You know, when you've loved and lost
the way Frank has,

131
00:08:33,828 --> 00:08:35,908
then you know what life's about.

132
00:08:36,028 --> 00:08:38,028
The New York Times may do something.

133
00:08:38,148 --> 00:08:39,828
IAN FAITH
Manager, Spinal Tap

134
00:08:39,988 --> 00:08:42,388
When do we get the album released?

135
00:08:42,548 --> 00:08:44,948
It doesn't matter how good the press is...

136
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:49,828
As I explained last night, we're not gonna
saturate the New York market.

137
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:52,788
Now, Philly is a real rock'n'roll town.

138
00:08:52,948 --> 00:08:57,348
The album will be available
all through the Philadelphia area.

139
00:08:57,508 --> 00:09:00,108
So you are hitting that market...

140
00:09:00,268 --> 00:09:03,188
We're certainly...
I'm doing everything I can.

141
00:09:03,348 --> 00:09:05,508
You know that we're not blaming you.

142
00:09:05,668 --> 00:09:08,108
But these guys have
an effect on an audience.

143
00:09:08,268 --> 00:09:10,828
Kids go to their concert,
have a great time.

144
00:09:10,948 --> 00:09:13,988
But it's... It's a passing thing. It's, uh...

145
00:09:14,948 --> 00:09:20,148
I would never tell them this,
but this is a... this is a fad.

146
00:09:29,908 --> 00:09:32,948
FIDELITY HALL
Philadelphia

147
00:09:41,028 --> 00:09:45,068
The bigger the cushion,
the sweeter the pushin'

148
00:09:45,228 --> 00:09:46,428
That's what I said

149
00:09:48,828 --> 00:09:52,788
The looser the waistband,
the deeper the quicksand

150
00:09:52,948 --> 00:09:55,028
Or so I have read

151
00:09:57,468 --> 00:10:01,268
My baby fits me like a flesh tuxedo

152
00:10:01,428 --> 00:10:05,388
I'd like to sink her with my pink torpedo

153
00:10:05,868 --> 00:10:07,588
Big bottom

154
00:10:07,988 --> 00:10:09,508
Big bottom

155
00:10:09,668 --> 00:10:13,068
Talk about bum cakes, my girl's got 'em

156
00:10:14,148 --> 00:10:17,228
Big bottom, drive me out of my mind

157
00:10:17,788 --> 00:10:21,508
How could I leave this behind?

158
00:10:27,588 --> 00:10:31,428
I met her on Monday,
'twas my lucky bun day

159
00:10:31,588 --> 00:10:33,308
You know what I mean

160
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:40,108
I love her each weekday,
each velvety cheek day

161
00:10:40,268 --> 00:10:41,988
You know what I mean

162
00:10:44,468 --> 00:10:47,588
My love gun's loaded
and she's in my sights

163
00:10:48,268 --> 00:10:52,348
Big game is waiting there
inside her tights, yeah

164
00:10:52,508 --> 00:10:54,108
Big bottom

165
00:10:54,828 --> 00:10:56,268
Big bottom

166
00:10:56,428 --> 00:10:59,748
Talk about mud flaps, my girl's got 'em

167
00:11:00,908 --> 00:11:03,868
Big bottom, drive me out of my mind

168
00:11:04,508 --> 00:11:08,828
How could I leave this behind?

169
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:19,748
Let's talk about your reviews,
regarding Intravenus de Milo.

170
00:11:19,948 --> 00:11:24,228
"This tasteless cover is a good indication
of the lack of musical invention within."

171
00:11:24,388 --> 00:11:27,948
"The musical growth rate of this band
cannot even be charted."

172
00:11:28,108 --> 00:11:31,708
"They're treading water in a sea
of retarded sexuality and bad poetry."

173
00:11:31,868 --> 00:11:33,108
That's nit-picking.

174
00:11:33,268 --> 00:11:35,348
The Gospel According To Spinal Tap.

175
00:11:35,508 --> 00:11:39,028
"This pretentious, ponderous collection
of religious rock psalms

176
00:11:39,188 --> 00:11:41,188
is enough to prompt the question,

177
00:11:41,348 --> 00:11:44,188
what day did the Lord create Spinal Tap,

178
00:11:44,348 --> 00:11:47,268
and couldn't he have rested
on that day, too?"

179
00:11:47,428 --> 00:11:49,868
I never heard that one. That's a good one.

180
00:11:50,028 --> 00:11:55,268
The review on Shark Sandwich, which
was merely a two-word review, just said:

181
00:11:55,428 --> 00:11:57,828
"Shit sandwich."

182
00:11:57,988 --> 00:12:01,828
- Where did that appear?
- That's not real, is it?

183
00:12:02,108 --> 00:12:03,948
RECORDING INDUSTRY CONVENTION
Atlanta, Georgia

184
00:12:04,108 --> 00:12:08,228
All those arguments about touring...
We belong on tour.

185
00:12:08,388 --> 00:12:12,588
All that stuff about you being
too old and being too white...

186
00:12:12,748 --> 00:12:16,708
What about the album, lan?
This is beginning to be a refrain here.

187
00:12:16,868 --> 00:12:20,388
There's no way
to promote something that doesn't exist.

188
00:12:20,548 --> 00:12:24,628
It's just that they're
just experimenting with, er,

189
00:12:24,788 --> 00:12:26,948
with new packaging materials.

190
00:12:27,108 --> 00:12:29,708
Experimenting?
They got monkeys opening it?

191
00:12:29,868 --> 00:12:33,188
The other thing is
that the Boston gig has been cancelled.

192
00:12:33,348 --> 00:12:36,508
I wouldn't worry about it.
It's not a big college town.

193
00:12:39,348 --> 00:12:41,948
You boys got an album
coming out or anything?

194
00:12:42,108 --> 00:12:44,428
Smell The Glove. It should be out...

195
00:12:44,588 --> 00:12:47,028
- Smell The Glove?
- Smell The Glove, yeah.

196
00:12:47,188 --> 00:12:50,508
- Provocative title.
- Wait till you see the cover.

197
00:12:50,668 --> 00:12:52,308
Very provocative indeed.

198
00:12:52,468 --> 00:12:55,948
Bobbi, can I tear you away from all this?

199
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,828
- Do you have a drink?
- I don't really need one.

200
00:12:58,988 --> 00:13:02,948
But, um, listen. I really do have to
talk to you a bit about this...

201
00:13:03,108 --> 00:13:05,268
lan, just tell me what's on your mind.

202
00:13:05,428 --> 00:13:07,348
- The issue of the cover.
- Yeah.

203
00:13:07,508 --> 00:13:11,508
Um... we, er, I mean, we feel,
and it seems to be fact,

204
00:13:11,668 --> 00:13:14,788
that the company's rather down
on the cover. Is that the case?

205
00:13:14,948 --> 00:13:16,868
- Yes.
- You can give it to me straight.

206
00:13:17,028 --> 00:13:19,228
Listen... they don't like the cover.

207
00:13:19,388 --> 00:13:22,828
- Well, that's straight.
- They find it offensive and sexist.

208
00:13:22,988 --> 00:13:24,628
What do you find offensive?

209
00:13:24,788 --> 00:13:29,788
lan, you put a greased,
naked woman on all fours

210
00:13:29,948 --> 00:13:32,988
with a dog collar around her neck
and a leash,

211
00:13:33,148 --> 00:13:36,108
and a man's arm extended out up to here

212
00:13:36,268 --> 00:13:41,188
holding onto the leash and pushing
a black glove in her face to sniff it.

213
00:13:41,348 --> 00:13:44,068
You don't find that offensive and sexist?

214
00:13:44,228 --> 00:13:46,668
- This is 1982!
- That's right, it's 1982.

215
00:13:46,828 --> 00:13:49,588
We don't have this mentality any more.

216
00:13:49,748 --> 00:13:52,748
You should've seen the cover
they wanted to do!

217
00:13:52,908 --> 00:13:55,508
This is something you have to talk about.

218
00:13:55,668 --> 00:14:00,468
- We're not laying down any conditions...
- A sexy cover isn't why an album sells.

219
00:14:00,628 --> 00:14:03,428
You tell me - The White Album?
What was that?

220
00:14:03,588 --> 00:14:05,908
There was nothing
on that goddamn cover.

221
00:14:06,068 --> 00:14:08,948
Excuse me. We'll talk about this after.

222
00:14:09,788 --> 00:14:11,148
Hello?

223
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:13,228
Oh, hi, Denis.

224
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:17,348
Uh-uh. OK.
Why don't you tell him?

225
00:14:17,508 --> 00:14:22,068
OK, hold on. Lan, it's Eton-Hogg.
He wants to talk to you.

226
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:25,588
- OK. Thank you, darling.
- You're welcome... dear.

227
00:14:26,228 --> 00:14:28,148
Hello? Sir Denis!

228
00:14:28,308 --> 00:14:30,308
Hi. How are you?

229
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:34,028
Oh...

230
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:37,828
Fuckin' old poofter!

231
00:14:38,108 --> 00:14:42,548
But it's really not that offensive,
Sir Denis! Come on!

232
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:45,828
OK. I'll call you
absolutely first thing in the morning.

233
00:14:48,068 --> 00:14:51,428
Oh, shit!
They're not gonna release the album,

234
00:14:51,588 --> 00:14:54,908
because they have decided
that the cover is sexist.

235
00:14:55,068 --> 00:14:58,388
So what? What's wrong with being sexy?
I mean, there's no...

236
00:14:58,548 --> 00:15:00,148
Sex-ist!

237
00:15:00,308 --> 00:15:02,268
OK, I wanted to tell you this,

238
00:15:02,428 --> 00:15:05,948
but I didn't know
what Denis's decision was going to be.

239
00:15:06,108 --> 00:15:08,748
But at this point,
both Sears and K-Mart stores

240
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:13,148
won't handle the album. They're
boycotting it because of the cover.

241
00:15:13,308 --> 00:15:16,988
If the company is behind an album,
it can shove it down their throats!

242
00:15:17,148 --> 00:15:19,588
Money talks and bullshit walks.

243
00:15:19,748 --> 00:15:23,708
And if the first album was a hit,
then we could have told them...

244
00:15:23,868 --> 00:15:27,948
- Every cut on this album...
- I don't give a shit...

245
00:15:28,108 --> 00:15:30,828
It was a joke
and they're making it a big deal.

246
00:15:30,988 --> 00:15:35,228
If we said she should be forced
to smell the glove,

247
00:15:35,388 --> 00:15:38,468
then you'd have a point.
But it's all a joke.

248
00:15:38,628 --> 00:15:42,068
- We're making fun of it.
- She should be made to smell it.

249
00:15:42,228 --> 00:15:44,228
But not over and over.

250
00:15:44,388 --> 00:15:49,028
We can work something out. I'll talk to
Denis and maybe we can compromise.

251
00:15:49,188 --> 00:15:51,588
A new design concept
we can all live with.

252
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:56,428
- You guys were schoolmates?
- We... We're not university material.

253
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:58,428
- What's on your finger?
- My gum.

254
00:15:58,588 --> 00:16:01,308
- Why is it on your finger?
- I might need it later.

255
00:16:01,468 --> 00:16:05,108
- Put it on the table. It's terrible.
- I might forget it on the table.

256
00:16:05,268 --> 00:16:08,508
- Can't take him anywhere!
- How old were you guys when you met?

257
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:11,428
About eight years old. Eight or nine.

258
00:16:11,588 --> 00:16:15,588
- You were eight and I was seven.
- That's right.

259
00:16:15,748 --> 00:16:19,308
Do you remember
the first song you wrote together?

260
00:16:19,468 --> 00:16:20,628
All The Way Home.

261
00:16:20,788 --> 00:16:22,548
- All The Way Home?
- Yeah.

262
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:25,588
Can you remember it?
I'd love to hear it.

263
00:16:25,748 --> 00:16:28,668
Christ! Some black coffee,
maybe we could do it.

264
00:16:28,868 --> 00:16:30,788
How's it go?

265
00:16:31,268 --> 00:16:34,268
- I was standin'
- Beside the railroad track

266
00:16:35,548 --> 00:16:38,468
And I'm waitin' for that train
to bring you back

267
00:16:38,868 --> 00:16:40,788
Bring you back

268
00:16:41,948 --> 00:16:45,388
If she's...
If she's not on the 5.19

269
00:16:45,548 --> 00:16:47,828
Then I'm gonna
know what sorrow means

270
00:16:47,988 --> 00:16:51,108
And I'm gonna cry, cry, cry,
all the way home

271
00:16:51,988 --> 00:16:54,388
- All the way home
- All the way home

272
00:16:54,548 --> 00:16:56,548
- All the way home
- All the way home

273
00:16:57,028 --> 00:17:00,948
- Cry... cry, cry, all the way home.
- Cry, cry, cry, all the way home.

274
00:17:01,068 --> 00:17:05,228
There was about six words in it.
Just repeating them over and over again.

275
00:17:05,388 --> 00:17:07,548
Let's talk about your music today.

276
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:12,108
One thing that puzzles me, um,
is the make-up of your audience.

277
00:17:12,268 --> 00:17:16,868
It seems to be predominantly young boys.

278
00:17:17,028 --> 00:17:18,668
Well, it's a sexual thing.

279
00:17:18,828 --> 00:17:22,068
Aside from
the identifying that the boys do with us,

280
00:17:22,188 --> 00:17:26,068
there's also, like,
a reaction of the female to our music.

281
00:17:26,188 --> 00:17:28,468
Really, they're quite fearful.

282
00:17:28,628 --> 00:17:32,268
They see us onstage with tight trousers...

283
00:17:32,428 --> 00:17:35,028
We've got, you know,
armadillos in our trousers.

284
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:37,548
It's really quite frightening, the size.

285
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:40,028
And... and they run screaming.

286
00:17:40,308 --> 00:17:44,708
VANDERMINT AUDITORIUM
Chapel Hill, North Carolina

287
00:17:44,868 --> 00:17:47,148
lan, can I have a word with you?

288
00:17:47,308 --> 00:17:49,228
Yes, of course. What?

289
00:17:49,788 --> 00:17:54,228
There are a couple of problems
with the arrangements backstage.

290
00:17:54,388 --> 00:17:57,588
- What exactly?
- Well, there are some problems here.

291
00:17:57,748 --> 00:17:59,868
I don't even know where to start.

292
00:18:00,028 --> 00:18:03,268
- Sound check? What?
- No, no, no, no. This. Look.

293
00:18:03,428 --> 00:18:05,988
There's a problem with... Look. This.

294
00:18:06,068 --> 00:18:10,468
This miniature bread. I've been working
with this for about half an hour.

295
00:18:10,628 --> 00:18:14,668
I can't figure out... Let's say
I want a bite, right? You got this...

296
00:18:14,828 --> 00:18:17,628
- You'd like bigger bread?
- Exactly! I don't understand...

297
00:18:17,788 --> 00:18:19,268
You could fold this.

298
00:18:19,428 --> 00:18:22,668
- Then it's half the size.
- Not the bread. You fold the meat.

299
00:18:22,828 --> 00:18:27,148
- Then it breaks apart like this.
- No, you put it on the bread like this.

300
00:18:27,308 --> 00:18:30,228
- But if you fold it, it breaks.
- Why fold it?

301
00:18:30,388 --> 00:18:32,428
Everything has to be folded.

302
00:18:32,588 --> 00:18:38,468
And then it's this, and I don't want this.
I want large bread, so that I can put this...

303
00:18:40,148 --> 00:18:44,028
So then it's like this,
but this doesn't work because it's all...

304
00:18:44,188 --> 00:18:45,668
Because it hangs out?

305
00:18:45,828 --> 00:18:49,668
- Would you hold this?
- I wouldn't want to put that in my mouth.

306
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:52,988
And then we move on to this. Look! Look!

307
00:18:53,148 --> 00:18:56,908
Who's in here? No one.
Then in here, there's a little guy.

308
00:18:57,068 --> 00:18:58,868
It's a complete catastrophe!

309
00:18:59,028 --> 00:19:01,788
You're right, Nigel,
but calm down, calm down.

310
00:19:01,948 --> 00:19:04,348
- It's no big deal. It's a joke.
- I'm sorry.

311
00:19:04,508 --> 00:19:06,668
It's just some cracker university.

312
00:19:06,828 --> 00:19:09,428
I don't want it to affect your performance.

313
00:19:09,588 --> 00:19:12,668
It won't affect my performance.
Don't worry.

314
00:19:12,828 --> 00:19:17,548
I just hate it. It does disturb me.
But I'll rise above it. I'm a professional.

315
00:19:22,148 --> 00:19:24,908
It's better in a hellhole

316
00:19:25,548 --> 00:19:28,748
You know where you stand in a hellhole

317
00:19:29,188 --> 00:19:32,828
Folks lend a hand in a hellhole

318
00:19:32,988 --> 00:19:37,068
Girl, get me back to my hellhole

319
00:20:29,068 --> 00:20:30,868
Do Stonehenge!

320
00:20:31,028 --> 00:20:34,548
Do you play...
Do you actually play all these?

321
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,948
I play them and I cherish them.

322
00:20:37,068 --> 00:20:38,788
This is at the top of the heap.

323
00:20:38,948 --> 00:20:41,948
No question about it.
Look at the flame on that one.

324
00:20:42,068 --> 00:20:44,988
It's just... It's quite unbelievable.

325
00:20:45,148 --> 00:20:49,388
This one is just... It's perfect, 1959.

326
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:51,348
You know, it just... Listen.

327
00:20:51,508 --> 00:20:53,468
- How much...
- Just listen.

328
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:56,988
- The sustain-listen to it.
- I'm not hearing anything.

329
00:20:57,148 --> 00:21:01,428
You would if it were playing.
Because it's famous for its sustain.

330
00:21:01,588 --> 00:21:04,748
- You can just hold it...
- So you don't...

331
00:21:04,908 --> 00:21:08,588
You can go and have a bite
and you'd still be hearing that one.

332
00:21:08,748 --> 00:21:10,628
- Can you hold this a sec?
- Sure.

333
00:21:10,788 --> 00:21:14,068
This one... This, of course,
is a custom three pick-up.

334
00:21:14,188 --> 00:21:16,308
This is my radio unit.

335
00:21:16,428 --> 00:21:21,228
So I strap this piece on
right down in here when I'm onstage.

336
00:21:21,388 --> 00:21:23,708
- It's a wireless.
- Wireless. Exactly.

337
00:21:23,868 --> 00:21:27,828
- I can play without all the muck.
- You can run anywhere onstage with it.

338
00:21:27,988 --> 00:21:30,548
This is special, too. Look, see?

339
00:21:30,668 --> 00:21:33,628
It's still got the tagger on it.
Never even played it.

340
00:21:33,788 --> 00:21:35,868
- You just bought it...
- Don't touch it.

341
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:37,748
I wasn't gonna touch it.

342
00:21:37,908 --> 00:21:40,308
- I was just pointing at it.
- Don't point.

343
00:21:40,468 --> 00:21:43,388
- Don't even point?
- No. It can't be played. Never.

344
00:21:43,548 --> 00:21:46,108
- Can I look at it?
- No. You've seen enough.

345
00:21:46,228 --> 00:21:48,308
This is what we use onstage.

346
00:21:48,468 --> 00:21:52,028
But it's very, very special
because, if you can see,

347
00:21:52,188 --> 00:21:55,068
the numbers all go to 11.

348
00:21:55,228 --> 00:21:58,788
Look. Right across the board.
11... 11... 11...

349
00:21:58,948 --> 00:22:01,508
- And most amps go up to ten?
- Exactly.

350
00:22:01,628 --> 00:22:06,028
- Does that mean it's louder?
- Well, it's one louder, isn't it?

351
00:22:06,188 --> 00:22:09,988
It's not ten. See, most blokes
are gonna be playing at ten.

352
00:22:10,148 --> 00:22:13,068
You're on ten here,
all the way up, all the way up.

353
00:22:13,308 --> 00:22:16,948
You're on ten-where can you go
from there? Where?

354
00:22:17,108 --> 00:22:19,028
- I don't know.
- Nowhere. Exactly!

355
00:22:19,188 --> 00:22:23,348
If we need that extra push over the cliff,
you know what we do?

356
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,988
- Put it up to 11.
- Exactly. One louder.

357
00:22:26,148 --> 00:22:29,628
Why don't you make ten louder,
make ten the top number,

358
00:22:29,788 --> 00:22:32,348
and make that a little louder?

359
00:22:33,908 --> 00:22:35,348
These go to 11.

360
00:22:36,548 --> 00:22:37,428
Are you Spinal Tap?

361
00:22:37,588 --> 00:22:39,788
- This is Spinal Tap.
- Welcome to Memphis.

362
00:22:39,948 --> 00:22:43,828
- Gentlemen, we have a slight problem.
- How slight?

363
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:46,548
- You wanted seven suites.
- Seven suites.

364
00:22:46,668 --> 00:22:49,588
He's put you on
the 7th floor with one suite.

365
00:22:49,748 --> 00:22:52,148
That's considerably more than minor.

366
00:22:52,308 --> 00:22:55,628
But it's a good-sized room.
It's a king leisure.

367
00:22:55,788 --> 00:22:58,828
How are we going to get 14 people
in a king leisure bed?

368
00:22:58,988 --> 00:23:01,108
- Don't tempt me, sir.
- Have a good time.

369
00:23:01,268 --> 00:23:03,828
- I'll take care of it.
- Welcome, gentlemen.

370
00:23:03,948 --> 00:23:06,028
- Very attractive...
- Listen to me!

371
00:23:06,188 --> 00:23:10,148
We want these suites. These people are
tired. We've a sound check in an hour.

372
00:23:10,308 --> 00:23:12,548
- What's the problem?
- Give me a hand, please.

373
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:16,628
I'll tell you what's wrong.
This twisted old fruit here

374
00:23:16,788 --> 00:23:19,508
- Tells me that...
- I'm just as God made me, sir.

375
00:23:19,668 --> 00:23:22,628
What's the difference between
golf and miniature golf?

376
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:25,508
Uh-oh, here they come.

377
00:23:25,668 --> 00:23:28,068
Duke! Duke! Would you...

378
00:23:29,388 --> 00:23:31,308
Can I have your autograph?

379
00:23:31,468 --> 00:23:34,588
Duke. It's OK, we know him.
It's Spinal Tap.

380
00:23:34,748 --> 00:23:36,988
- David St Hubbins, Spinal Tap.
- How ya doin'?

381
00:23:37,148 --> 00:23:38,548
Derek Smalls.

382
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:41,668
- We gotta get going.
- Where are you playin'?

383
00:23:41,828 --> 00:23:45,908
We're doin' the... Enormo Dome.
We sold it out.

384
00:23:46,068 --> 00:23:48,548
That's a big place. You sold it out?!

385
00:23:48,708 --> 00:23:51,028
We really should run, you know.

386
00:23:51,188 --> 00:23:55,388
Good heavens! How are you?
Great to see you, Ter.

387
00:23:55,548 --> 00:23:57,548
- Um... Liam!
- Lan.

388
00:23:57,708 --> 00:23:59,028
lan!

389
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:03,628
We'd love to chat, but we gotta sit
in the lobby and wait for the limo.

390
00:24:03,788 --> 00:24:06,468
- OK.
- Great to see you again, Terry.

391
00:24:06,628 --> 00:24:08,988
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

392
00:24:09,148 --> 00:24:10,988
Great. Great to see you.

393
00:24:11,148 --> 00:24:14,268
- Good days. Good days.
- Nice to see you.

394
00:24:14,428 --> 00:24:16,788
Fuckin' wanker. What a wanker.

395
00:24:16,948 --> 00:24:20,068
He's got this much talent.
This much if he's lucky.

396
00:24:20,228 --> 00:24:22,788
We had to apologise for him with our set.

397
00:24:22,948 --> 00:24:26,388
People were still booin' him
when we were on. It's all hype.

398
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:30,108
- We got our rooms. Big fat suites.
- Can I ask you something?

399
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:33,308
Have you seen
Duke Fame's current album?

400
00:24:33,468 --> 00:24:35,788
- Um... yes.
- You've seen the cover?

401
00:24:35,948 --> 00:24:38,948
- No, I don't think I have.
- It's a rather lurid cover.

402
00:24:39,108 --> 00:24:41,908
It's, like, naked women and...

403
00:24:42,068 --> 00:24:46,988
He's tied down to this table and they've
got whips and they're all semi-nude.

404
00:24:47,148 --> 00:24:50,668
- What's your point?
- It's much worse than Smell The Glove.

405
00:24:50,828 --> 00:24:53,228
He releases that and he's number three.

406
00:24:53,388 --> 00:24:57,588
But he's the victim. Their objections
were that she was the victim.

407
00:24:57,748 --> 00:25:00,228
If the singer's the victim, it's not sexist.

408
00:25:00,388 --> 00:25:03,948
- He did a twist on it.
- We should've thought of that.

409
00:25:04,108 --> 00:25:06,948
If we'd had you guys tied up,
that would've been fine.

410
00:25:07,108 --> 00:25:10,668
It's such a fine line between stupid and...

411
00:25:10,828 --> 00:25:12,988
- And clever.
- It's just that turnabout.

412
00:25:13,148 --> 00:25:16,548
I have a piece of bad news.
Although it may not be that bad.

413
00:25:16,708 --> 00:25:19,588
We're, er... we're cancelled here.

414
00:25:19,748 --> 00:25:22,948
- At the hotel?
- No, the gig is cancelled.

415
00:25:23,108 --> 00:25:24,428
Fuck!

416
00:25:24,588 --> 00:25:29,228
"Memphis show cancelled
due to lack of advertising funds."

417
00:25:29,508 --> 00:25:35,188
The last time Tap toured America, they
were... booked into 10,000-seat arenas

418
00:25:35,348 --> 00:25:39,748
and 15,000-seat venues. And it seems
that now, on the current tour,

419
00:25:39,908 --> 00:25:44,268
they're being booked into
1200-seat arenas, 1500-seat arenas.

420
00:25:44,428 --> 00:25:48,548
I was wondering, does this mean
the popularity of the group is waning?

421
00:25:48,708 --> 00:25:51,868
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, not at all.

422
00:25:52,028 --> 00:25:56,788
I just think that... that their appeal
is becoming more selective.

423
00:25:58,188 --> 00:26:00,548
I notice you got this cricket bat here.

424
00:26:00,708 --> 00:26:04,468
- Do you play?
- No. I carry this partly out of...

425
00:26:04,628 --> 00:26:07,188
I don't know. Sort of...

426
00:26:08,068 --> 00:26:10,948
- I suppose... What's the word?
- Affectation?

427
00:26:11,108 --> 00:26:14,108
Yes. It's a kind of totemistic thing,
you know.

428
00:26:14,268 --> 00:26:18,068
To be frank, it's come in useful
in a couple of situations.

429
00:26:18,228 --> 00:26:21,148
Certainly in the
topsy-turvy world of heavy rock.

430
00:26:21,308 --> 00:26:25,988
Having a good solid piece of wood
in your hand is quite often... useful.

431
00:26:26,268 --> 00:26:28,068
I miss you too, darling.

432
00:26:28,228 --> 00:26:30,508
Um, not too well, actually.

433
00:26:30,668 --> 00:26:34,188
We got to Memphis
and there's no gig in Memphis.

434
00:26:34,348 --> 00:26:37,548
And we find out
this promoter in the Midwest

435
00:26:37,708 --> 00:26:40,868
has pulled out of St Louis
and Kansas City,

436
00:26:41,028 --> 00:26:43,188
and, um,

437
00:26:43,348 --> 00:26:45,068
oh, Des Moines.

438
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:47,428
I don't know. It's in Indiana or something.

439
00:26:49,508 --> 00:26:51,588
I thought...

440
00:26:51,748 --> 00:26:54,668
Oh, don't tease me. That's not until April.

441
00:26:54,828 --> 00:26:58,828
Great! We'll do it! Oh, fuckin' great!

442
00:26:59,748 --> 00:27:02,388
Milwaukee. Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

443
00:27:02,548 --> 00:27:05,308
I have no idea.
You might have to fly to New York

444
00:27:05,468 --> 00:27:08,748
and then go to Milwaukee from there.

445
00:27:09,388 --> 00:27:11,108
Oh, God, I love you too!

446
00:27:11,268 --> 00:27:12,988
OK. Bye.

447
00:27:15,348 --> 00:27:19,548
Well, my problems are solved, mate.
Jeanine, she's gonna come meet us.

448
00:27:19,708 --> 00:27:25,348
She was supposed to do this window
layout for Neil Khyatt's boutique, but...

449
00:27:25,508 --> 00:27:29,108
- Is she coming to drop some stuff off?
- No, she's coming on the road.

450
00:27:29,268 --> 00:27:32,668
She's gonna travel with us.
She's gonna go on the road with us.

451
00:27:32,828 --> 00:27:35,988
She says she can hear that
I'm eating too much sugar on the phone.

452
00:27:36,148 --> 00:27:38,188
She says my larynx is fat.

453
00:27:38,348 --> 00:27:43,268
You might want to come next door.
The radio's playing a bit of your past.

454
00:27:44,388 --> 00:27:46,308
Are you happy for me?

455
00:27:50,428 --> 00:27:53,548
- I don't believe it!
- Just have a listen, man.

456
00:27:57,708 --> 00:28:00,948
How sad it must end
but I'm glad I've a friend

457
00:28:01,108 --> 00:28:03,948
Sharing cups and cakes with me

458
00:28:04,108 --> 00:28:09,268
And cakes with me

459
00:28:09,428 --> 00:28:12,628
Oh, yeah! Goin' all the way back to 1965!

460
00:28:13,188 --> 00:28:17,548
Doesn't it feel good with
The Thames Men and "Cups & Cakes"?

461
00:28:17,708 --> 00:28:22,108
The Thames Men later became Spinal Tap
and had a couple of nice-sized hits.

462
00:28:22,268 --> 00:28:25,068
They're currently in the
"Where Are They Now?" file.

463
00:28:25,228 --> 00:28:27,788
Johnny Q with you on Golden 106,
and right after we...

464
00:28:30,148 --> 00:28:32,868
I'm not sure this was a good idea.
I don't feel any better.

465
00:28:33,028 --> 00:28:34,788
GRACELAND
Memphis, Tennessee

466
00:28:36,308 --> 00:28:39,548
He was gonna do a TV special
from here before he died.

467
00:28:39,708 --> 00:28:43,108
Yeah, a musical version
of Somebody Up There Likes Me.

468
00:28:46,028 --> 00:28:48,668
Well, since my baby left me

469
00:28:48,828 --> 00:28:51,508
I found a new place to dwell

470
00:28:51,668 --> 00:28:54,268
Well, it's down at the end
of Lonely Street

471
00:28:54,428 --> 00:28:57,348
At Heartbreak Hotel

472
00:28:57,508 --> 00:28:59,988
- Do it with the harmony parts.
- All right.

473
00:29:00,148 --> 00:29:01,788
Well, since my baby

474
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:03,948
The same key, though, I think.

475
00:29:04,108 --> 00:29:06,268
Well, since my baby left me

476
00:29:06,428 --> 00:29:10,148
If I'm going:
Since my baby left me

477
00:29:10,308 --> 00:29:13,148
- Me
- No, you can't hit that note.

478
00:29:14,068 --> 00:29:16,708
Since my baby left me

479
00:29:16,868 --> 00:29:19,508
Well, I found a new place to dwell

480
00:29:20,268 --> 00:29:22,948
- That's all right.
- Not really.

481
00:29:23,108 --> 00:29:26,508
- It sounds raga. You don't wanna go raga.
- Not with this, it don't.

482
00:29:26,668 --> 00:29:29,628
- Since my baby left me
- It sounds fuckin' barbershop.

483
00:29:29,788 --> 00:29:32,108
- Barbershop raga.
- Watch the language.

484
00:29:32,268 --> 00:29:35,188
- You're in the presence of the King.
- Oh. Sorry.

485
00:29:36,788 --> 00:29:38,988
This is thoroughly depressing.

486
00:29:39,148 --> 00:29:41,708
Really puts a perspective on things,
doesn't it?

487
00:29:41,868 --> 00:29:45,588
Too much. There's too much fuckin'
perspective now.

488
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:50,708
In 1967, that was the first time
Spinal Tap came into existence.

489
00:29:50,868 --> 00:29:52,908
The whole world was changing
in those days.

490
00:29:53,068 --> 00:29:57,468
We had the world's ear because we had
just released an enormous-selling single.

491
00:29:57,628 --> 00:29:59,828
- Listen To The Flower People.
- Flower People.

492
00:29:59,988 --> 00:30:02,108
We toured the world.
We toured the States.

493
00:30:02,268 --> 00:30:05,108
- Toured the world and elsewhere.
- A dream come true.

494
00:30:05,268 --> 00:30:09,908
Listen to what the flower people say

495
00:30:10,068 --> 00:30:13,468
"JAMBOREEPOP"
(American TV - 1967)

496
00:30:13,628 --> 00:30:20,028
Listen, it's getting louder every day

497
00:30:22,468 --> 00:30:27,748
Listen, it's like a bolt out of the blue

498
00:30:31,108 --> 00:30:36,588
Listen, it could be calling out for you

499
00:30:54,668 --> 00:30:57,508
In the Flower People period,
who was your drummer?

500
00:30:57,668 --> 00:30:59,508
Stumpy's replacement,
Peter "James" Bond.

501
00:30:59,668 --> 00:31:02,548
He also died in mysterious
circumstances.

502
00:31:02,708 --> 00:31:05,988
We were playing a jazz blues festival.
Where was that?

503
00:31:06,148 --> 00:31:09,028
- Blues jazz, really.
- Blues jazz festival.

504
00:31:09,188 --> 00:31:11,108
That was in the Isle...

505
00:31:11,268 --> 00:31:13,508
The Isle of Lucy jazz and blues festival.

506
00:31:13,668 --> 00:31:18,188
And it was tragic, really.
He exploded onstage.

507
00:31:18,348 --> 00:31:20,108
- Just like that.
- He just went up.

508
00:31:20,268 --> 00:31:22,988
He just was like a flash of green light...

509
00:31:23,788 --> 00:31:28,188
- And that was it. Nothing was left.
- It's true. This really did happen.

510
00:31:28,348 --> 00:31:30,908
There was a little green globule
on his drum seat.

511
00:31:31,028 --> 00:31:34,188
- Like a stain, really.
- More of a stain than a globule.

512
00:31:34,348 --> 00:31:38,468
You know, several... dozens of people
spontaneously combust each year.

513
00:31:38,628 --> 00:31:41,828
It's just not really widely reported.

514
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:43,748
SHANK HALL
Milwaukee, Wisconsin

515
00:31:43,908 --> 00:31:45,428
Testing!

516
00:31:45,828 --> 00:31:47,828
Test, test, test.
This is mike number one.

517
00:31:47,988 --> 00:31:50,268
This is mike number one.
Isn't this a lot of fun?

518
00:31:50,428 --> 00:31:52,028
OK, he's got the mikes.

519
00:31:52,188 --> 00:31:55,108
Let's do GSM, all right? GSM.

520
00:31:58,148 --> 00:32:00,068
Stop wastin' my time

521
00:32:01,428 --> 00:32:03,308
You know what I want

522
00:32:03,628 --> 00:32:05,028
Heavy up!

523
00:32:05,188 --> 00:32:08,148
You know what I n-n-n-need

524
00:32:09,028 --> 00:32:11,108
Or maybe you don't

525
00:32:13,308 --> 00:32:17,948
Or do I have to come right
smack-dab out and tell you everythin'

526
00:32:18,108 --> 00:32:21,028
Gimme some money!

527
00:32:22,108 --> 00:32:25,028
Gimme some money!

528
00:32:25,188 --> 00:32:26,708
Oh, yeah

529
00:32:32,228 --> 00:32:34,468
Hello, darling!

530
00:32:34,628 --> 00:32:36,828
Hello! I've got a surprise for you!

531
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:40,708
- Where'd you come from?
- Where do you think I came from?

532
00:32:40,868 --> 00:32:43,748
The bloody aeroplane, didn't I? Right?

533
00:32:45,988 --> 00:32:46,828
David?

534
00:32:46,988 --> 00:32:49,548
David? David?

535
00:32:50,188 --> 00:32:51,508
David?

536
00:32:51,668 --> 00:32:53,948
Oh, that feels good!

537
00:32:54,108 --> 00:32:57,348
Oh, I've been wanting to do that
for a long time!

538
00:32:58,708 --> 00:33:01,868
- Want me to carry it about with me?
- What's all this?

539
00:33:02,028 --> 00:33:04,948
That's the film crew. I told you about this.

540
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:08,828
- Martin, this is Jeanine.
- Hello.

541
00:33:09,868 --> 00:33:12,788
Here it is! Here it is, lads!

542
00:33:13,828 --> 00:33:16,028
Smell The Glove, me old beauties!

543
00:33:16,188 --> 00:33:18,108
Gather round. Where's David?

544
00:33:18,268 --> 00:33:19,988
David! David, get up here!

545
00:33:20,708 --> 00:33:24,068
David, Smell The Glove is here.
Hello, Jeanine.

546
00:33:24,228 --> 00:33:26,788
The moment we've all been waiting for!

547
00:33:26,948 --> 00:33:30,268
- I never thought I'd see the day.
- Plenty for everybody!

548
00:33:31,908 --> 00:33:34,268
- What do you think?
- Is this the test pressing?

549
00:33:34,428 --> 00:33:35,908
No, this is it.

550
00:33:36,068 --> 00:33:40,628
- This is Smell The Glove by Spinal Tap?
- That's the jacket cover

551
00:33:40,788 --> 00:33:44,548
- That's going out across the country.
- This is the compromise you made?

552
00:33:44,708 --> 00:33:47,148
- Is it going to say anything here?
- Nope, it's not gonna say anything.

553
00:33:47,308 --> 00:33:51,428
- So it's just gonna be all black?
- Simple, beautiful, classic.

554
00:33:51,588 --> 00:33:56,268
It does look like black leather.
You can see yourself in both sides.

555
00:33:56,828 --> 00:33:58,508
It's like a black mirror.

556
00:33:58,628 --> 00:34:01,588
I think it looks like death.
It looks like mourning.

557
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:06,148
Every movie in every cinema
is about death. Death sells.

558
00:34:06,308 --> 00:34:10,028
I think he's right. There's something
about this that is so black,

559
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:15,668
it's, like, how much more black could
this be? And the answer is... none. None...

560
00:34:15,828 --> 00:34:20,868
You're rationalising this whole thing
like it's something you did on purpose.

561
00:34:21,028 --> 00:34:25,028
I think we're stuck with a very stupid
and dismal-looking album.

562
00:34:25,148 --> 00:34:29,948
It's something you wear around your arm.
You don't put it on your fuckin' turntable!

563
00:34:30,108 --> 00:34:34,948
This is the turning point, OK?
I think this is... We're on our way now.

564
00:34:35,108 --> 00:34:37,148
It's time... It's time to kick arse.

565
00:35:08,708 --> 00:35:12,628
When there was darkness
and the void was king

566
00:35:12,788 --> 00:35:16,028
And ruled the elements

567
00:35:16,148 --> 00:35:18,908
When there was silence, and the hush

568
00:35:19,068 --> 00:35:21,988
Was almost deafening

569
00:35:25,388 --> 00:35:29,028
- Out of the emptiness
- Salvation

570
00:35:29,148 --> 00:35:30,908
Salvation

571
00:35:32,228 --> 00:35:34,788
Rhythm and light and sound

572
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:38,708
'Twas a rock'n'roll creation

573
00:35:38,868 --> 00:35:41,108
'Twas a terrible big bang

574
00:35:41,988 --> 00:35:45,468
It was the ultimate mutation

575
00:35:45,748 --> 00:35:48,508
Yin was searching for his Yang

576
00:35:48,628 --> 00:35:52,988
And he looked
and he saw that it was good

577
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:09,788
I look to the stars
and the answer is clear

578
00:36:10,348 --> 00:36:16,988
I look in the mirror and see what I fear

579
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:35,028
'Tis the rock'n'roll creation

580
00:36:35,548 --> 00:36:38,468
'Tis the absolute rebirth

581
00:36:38,828 --> 00:36:41,748
It is the rolling of the ocean

582
00:36:42,068 --> 00:36:44,388
And the rocking of the earth

583
00:36:45,108 --> 00:36:49,468
And I looked and I saw that it was good

584
00:37:12,388 --> 00:37:16,348
Given the history of Spinal Tap
drummers in the past,

585
00:37:16,508 --> 00:37:19,868
do you have any fears, uh... for your life?

586
00:37:20,028 --> 00:37:22,188
When I did join, they did tell me.

587
00:37:22,348 --> 00:37:26,388
They took me aside and said,
"Mick, you know, it's like this."

588
00:37:26,548 --> 00:37:30,868
And it did kind of freak me out a bit,

589
00:37:31,028 --> 00:37:34,108
but it can't always happen to every...
Can it?

590
00:37:34,268 --> 00:37:37,108
The law of averages says you will survive.

591
00:37:37,268 --> 00:37:37,868
Yeah.

592
00:37:41,548 --> 00:37:44,268
Whoa, quite exciting.

593
00:37:44,388 --> 00:37:47,068
Quite exciting, this computer magic.

594
00:37:48,548 --> 00:37:53,148
- How many planets have you destroyed?
- About four for a fifth time round, I think.

595
00:37:53,308 --> 00:37:56,108
We're doing really fine.
A few galaxies gone, you know.

596
00:37:58,708 --> 00:38:02,108
- This is Cindy's first moustache.
- Is it?

597
00:38:03,228 --> 00:38:05,788
- Can I take it off now?
- Why, are you too hot in it?

598
00:38:05,948 --> 00:38:09,828
No, it's... I thought I might go back
and see what they were up to.

599
00:38:09,988 --> 00:38:13,708
I don't think they need to see this
until you're finished with it, you know?

600
00:38:13,868 --> 00:38:16,388
You were reading. You can read here.

601
00:38:16,548 --> 00:38:19,228
Yeah, but they got
the new game back there.

602
00:38:19,388 --> 00:38:22,788
I thought I could maybe
have a look at the new game.

603
00:38:22,948 --> 00:38:26,628
- It's like a submarine thing.
- You've got stuff over you again.

604
00:38:26,788 --> 00:38:29,908
Before I met Jeanine,
my life was a shambles.

605
00:38:30,068 --> 00:38:35,348
I was using whatever Eastern philosophy
happened to drift through my transom.

606
00:38:36,028 --> 00:38:41,388
And she sort of sorted it out for me.
Gave me a path, you know, to follow.

607
00:38:41,548 --> 00:38:44,988
Do you have as much influence
over his musical expression?

608
00:38:45,148 --> 00:38:50,348
Oh, yeah. I mean, I listen to him
when he's experimenting-don't I?

609
00:38:50,508 --> 00:38:54,628
He plays things to me sometimes
when he's worked out...

610
00:38:54,788 --> 00:38:57,348
He's got a new bit
he wants to tell me about.

611
00:38:57,468 --> 00:39:00,988
And I say that's good or that's bad
or that's shit or whatever.

612
00:39:03,148 --> 00:39:05,308
She's very honest. She's brutally frank.

613
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:08,548
How does that go over
with the other band members?

614
00:39:08,708 --> 00:39:12,908
She gives me the brutally frank version,
and I sort of tart it up for them.

615
00:39:13,548 --> 00:39:15,988
It's so strange because Nigel

616
00:39:16,148 --> 00:39:21,908
and Jeanine are so similar
in so many ways, but they just can't...

617
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:23,788
They don't dislike each other.

618
00:39:23,948 --> 00:39:26,308
- There's great love between them.
- Oh, yes.

619
00:39:26,468 --> 00:39:30,988
But there's some sort of communication
that's just blocked or something.

620
00:39:45,708 --> 00:39:48,508
- It's pretty.
- Yeah, I like it.

621
00:39:48,628 --> 00:39:51,708
Been foolin' about with it
for a few months now.

622
00:39:51,868 --> 00:39:53,428
Very delicate.

623
00:39:53,588 --> 00:39:57,948
It's a bit of a departure from
the kind of thing you normally play.

624
00:39:58,108 --> 00:40:00,788
Yeah, well, it's part of a trilogy, really.

625
00:40:00,948 --> 00:40:03,508
A musical trilogy that I'm doing

626
00:40:03,628 --> 00:40:08,948
in D... minor, which I always find
is really the saddest of all keys, really.

627
00:40:09,108 --> 00:40:13,068
I don't know why but it makes people
weep instantly if you play it.

628
00:40:15,308 --> 00:40:18,228
- It's a horn part.
- It's very pretty.

629
00:40:20,388 --> 00:40:23,588
You know, just simple lines, intertwining.

630
00:40:23,748 --> 00:40:26,988
Very much like...
I'm really influenced by Mozart and Bach.

631
00:40:27,148 --> 00:40:30,268
And it's sort of in between those,
like a Mach piece.

632
00:40:30,388 --> 00:40:32,148
What do you call this?

633
00:40:32,308 --> 00:40:35,268
This piece is called Lick My Love Pump.

634
00:40:41,108 --> 00:40:43,348
Do you have any metal objects
in your pockets?

635
00:40:43,508 --> 00:40:46,068
- Yeah.
- Put them in the bucket.

636
00:40:46,748 --> 00:40:49,068
Coins... keys...

637
00:40:52,148 --> 00:40:54,228
Tuning fork.

638
00:40:54,388 --> 00:40:57,108
Musician.
I have to stay in tune, you know?

639
00:41:00,468 --> 00:41:02,108
Oh. OK.

640
00:41:02,268 --> 00:41:07,428
- Could you take this jacket off, please?
- Oh, it's the zipper. Sets off the machine.

641
00:41:07,588 --> 00:41:09,508
Let's go, hurry up!

642
00:41:12,988 --> 00:41:15,308
Step over here, please.

643
00:41:15,468 --> 00:41:17,068
Raise your arms.

644
00:41:17,228 --> 00:41:22,548
Departure at gate 12 has been
delayed for approximately 20 minutes.

645
00:41:36,148 --> 00:41:39,788
- Do you have artificial plates or limbs?
- Not really, no.

646
00:41:41,348 --> 00:41:43,268
Would you, um...

647
00:42:00,228 --> 00:42:02,188
I don't need a woman

648
00:42:02,348 --> 00:42:05,148
I won't take me no wife

649
00:42:06,628 --> 00:42:11,268
I got the rock'n'roll and that'll be my life

650
00:42:14,348 --> 00:42:19,548
No page in history, baby,
that I don't need

651
00:42:20,868 --> 00:42:24,388
I just wanna make some eardrums bleed

652
00:42:26,228 --> 00:42:27,868
- Heavy
- Heavy

653
00:42:28,028 --> 00:42:30,068
- Duty
- Duty

654
00:42:30,228 --> 00:42:33,148
Heavy duty rock'n'roll

655
00:42:38,548 --> 00:42:39,908
- Heavy
- Heavy

656
00:42:40,068 --> 00:42:41,508
- Duty
- Duty

657
00:42:42,108 --> 00:42:47,388
Brings out the duty in my soul

658
00:43:12,508 --> 00:43:14,308
CHICAGO, ILLINOIS

659
00:43:17,868 --> 00:43:21,108
Hi. Artie Fufkin, Polymer Records.
How are you?

660
00:43:21,268 --> 00:43:24,148
- How you doing? You are... Derek.
- Derek.

661
00:43:24,308 --> 00:43:26,228
Artie Fufkin, Polymer Records.

662
00:43:26,388 --> 00:43:29,348
I'm your promo man here in Chicago.
I love you guys.

663
00:43:29,508 --> 00:43:33,068
And, of course, Nigel.
I love you. Nigel Tufnel.

664
00:43:33,228 --> 00:43:35,348
I love your stuff. I go back with you guys.

665
00:43:35,508 --> 00:43:37,388
Artie Fufkin, Polymer Records.

666
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:40,228
- And who are you, darlin'?
- This is my special new friend, Cindy.

667
00:43:40,388 --> 00:43:42,228
- Hello, Cindy.
- And this is Belinda.

668
00:43:42,388 --> 00:43:44,988
Hello, Belinda.
Artie Fufkin, Polymer Records.

669
00:43:45,148 --> 00:43:49,828
And I... Oh, what's going on here? Hi!
Hi, guys. Artie Fufkin, Polymer Records.

670
00:43:49,988 --> 00:43:52,348
Nice to see you. And where is David?

671
00:43:52,508 --> 00:43:56,028
David, hi! Artie Fufkin.
How are you? Nice to see you.

672
00:43:56,188 --> 00:44:00,428
- We've got something happening...
- It's the food! It's the food!

673
00:44:00,588 --> 00:44:04,228
Oh! Thank God! Civilisation!
Where do I put this?

674
00:44:29,668 --> 00:44:34,148
What are you doin' to me here? I thought
we had a relationship. What happened?

675
00:44:34,308 --> 00:44:36,668
Business is terrible. What can I tell you?

676
00:44:36,828 --> 00:44:40,508
A record store with a promotion
and nobody shows up?

677
00:44:40,668 --> 00:44:42,588
This isn't a personal thing.

678
00:44:42,748 --> 00:44:45,148
Forget personal thing.
We had a relationship.

679
00:44:45,308 --> 00:44:46,988
What about our relationship?

680
00:44:48,988 --> 00:44:51,988
I feel like a schlub.
I don't know what's happening.

681
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:54,508
It's me, that's what is happening. It's me.

682
00:44:54,668 --> 00:44:56,308
I did it. It's my fault.

683
00:44:56,468 --> 00:44:58,588
We were told massive radio support.

684
00:44:58,748 --> 00:45:02,588
We did! We did massive.
We saturated. We over-saturated.

685
00:45:03,028 --> 00:45:05,108
It's me. I did it. I fucked up.

686
00:45:05,788 --> 00:45:09,468
I fucked up the timing, that's all.
I got no timing. I got no timing.

687
00:45:09,628 --> 00:45:12,108
- You know what I want you to do?
- What?

688
00:45:12,268 --> 00:45:15,268
Do me a favour. Just kick my ass, OK?

689
00:45:15,428 --> 00:45:16,908
Kick this ass.

690
00:45:17,308 --> 00:45:19,428
Kick my ass. Enjoy. Come on!

691
00:45:19,588 --> 00:45:22,188
I'm not asking, I'm telling with this.
Kick my ass.

692
00:45:24,988 --> 00:45:28,548
XANADU STAR THEATER
Cleveland, Ohio

693
00:45:34,388 --> 00:45:37,308
We've kept 'em waitin' long enough.
Let's do it.

694
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:39,748
Come on, Mick!

695
00:45:39,908 --> 00:45:43,028
- Let's go, Mr Shrimpton!
- Rock'n'roll!

696
00:45:43,188 --> 00:45:45,068
Rock'n'roll!

697
00:45:47,348 --> 00:45:49,068
Let's have some rock'n'roll!

698
00:45:49,228 --> 00:45:51,788
Rock'n'roll! Let's go, then.

699
00:45:55,708 --> 00:45:58,028
- It's gonna be a hot one.
- It's gonna be great.

700
00:45:58,188 --> 00:46:00,788
- Not an exit.
- We don't want an exit.

701
00:46:00,948 --> 00:46:03,308
- No, that's true.
- This way.

702
00:46:03,468 --> 00:46:05,788
Yeah, this way. Let's go.

703
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:10,548
Um...

704
00:46:10,708 --> 00:46:14,148
- Wait. This looks familiar, though.
- Listen!

705
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:19,828
Shit!

706
00:46:21,788 --> 00:46:23,668
Let's not lose it, let's not lose it.

707
00:46:23,828 --> 00:46:25,868
Where the fuck is lan?
He should be here.

708
00:46:26,028 --> 00:46:28,028
Tap! Tap! Tap! Tap!

709
00:46:28,908 --> 00:46:32,828
We've gotta get to it some way.
We've been onstage, right?

710
00:46:34,148 --> 00:46:37,468
We're in the group.
We're in the group that's playin' tonight.

711
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:42,428
You go straight through this door here,
down the hall, turn right,

712
00:46:42,588 --> 00:46:46,228
and then there's a little jog,
about 30 feet. Jog to the left.

713
00:46:46,388 --> 00:46:49,708
- We don't have time for that.
- Go straight ahead,

714
00:46:49,868 --> 00:46:51,948
turn right at the next two corners.

715
00:46:52,108 --> 00:46:55,348
On the first door is a sign:
"authorised personnel only".

716
00:46:55,508 --> 00:46:57,988
- Open that door. That's the stage.
- You think so?

717
00:46:58,148 --> 00:47:00,708
You're authorised.
You're musicians, aren't ya?

718
00:47:00,868 --> 00:47:02,708
Thank you. Thank you very much.

719
00:47:02,868 --> 00:47:04,588
Rock'n'roll!

720
00:47:04,748 --> 00:47:05,708
Rock'n'roll!

721
00:47:05,868 --> 00:47:08,188
Let's get it! Let's get it!

722
00:47:08,348 --> 00:47:10,428
- This way?
- No, this way.

723
00:47:10,588 --> 00:47:12,548
Straight through. Rock'n'roll!

724
00:47:12,708 --> 00:47:15,628
Hello, Cleveland! Hello, Cleveland!

725
00:47:17,588 --> 00:47:20,988
- Fuck!
- You must've made a wrong turn.

726
00:47:21,388 --> 00:47:26,428
- We gotta go another way.
- Other way, other way. Other way!

727
00:47:26,988 --> 00:47:31,388
I hate to keep harping on, but the notion
of a black album has cursed us.

728
00:47:31,548 --> 00:47:35,348
We're getting substantial reports
of airplay. Don't worry about that.

729
00:47:35,508 --> 00:47:40,028
But... it might have been better if the, uh...
album had been mixed right.

730
00:47:40,188 --> 00:47:43,388
Well, no use crying over that,
but of course that's true.

731
00:47:43,548 --> 00:47:45,908
Well, it was mixed all wrong, wasn't it?

732
00:47:46,068 --> 00:47:48,268
It was mixed wrong? Were you there?

733
00:47:48,428 --> 00:47:53,028
- But she's heard the record.
- So your judgment is it was mixed wrong.

734
00:47:53,188 --> 00:47:56,588
- You couldn't hear the lyrics.
- You don't agree?

735
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:59,308
- No, I do not agree.
- Well, I think maybe...

736
00:47:59,428 --> 00:48:02,988
- It's interesting she's bringing it up.
- She'd like to hear the vocals.

737
00:48:03,148 --> 00:48:06,908
It's like me saying you're using
the wrong conditioner for your hair.

738
00:48:07,068 --> 00:48:09,468
It looks sort of frizzy.

739
00:48:09,628 --> 00:48:13,628
- You don't do 'eavy metal in Dubly.
- In what? In what?

740
00:48:16,148 --> 00:48:20,148
- In Dubly. You can't...
- She means Dolby, all right?

741
00:48:20,308 --> 00:48:21,788
You know what she means.

742
00:48:22,428 --> 00:48:24,868
You shan't recover from this one.

743
00:48:25,028 --> 00:48:29,988
Can I have the floor for just one moment?
I've got something I'd like to show you.

744
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:33,548
Jeanine's been working
on these very hard.

745
00:48:33,708 --> 00:48:36,988
- These are a new direction...
- A new presentation.

746
00:48:37,148 --> 00:48:40,388
The stage look of the band,
based on the signs of the zodiac.

747
00:48:40,548 --> 00:48:42,028
We need a new presentation.

748
00:48:42,188 --> 00:48:47,948
This is a look for Viv. He's a Libra.
There's the sort of Yin/Yang sort of look.

749
00:48:48,108 --> 00:48:50,948
This is Nigel. He's Capricorn.

750
00:48:51,388 --> 00:48:53,388
- Sort of a goat look.
- With a beard.

751
00:48:53,548 --> 00:48:55,628
- Is this a joke?
- This...

752
00:48:55,788 --> 00:48:59,228
- Excuse me. Is this a joke?
- Just bear with us for one moment.

753
00:48:59,388 --> 00:49:02,068
This... I love this.
I wish I were Cancer.

754
00:49:02,228 --> 00:49:04,788
- That's attractive.
- This is your crab face.

755
00:49:04,948 --> 00:49:06,668
Give it a chance.

756
00:49:06,828 --> 00:49:10,228
- And this is...
- David, wait, please. Wait a minute.

757
00:49:10,388 --> 00:49:15,668
Have you any idea what it will cost
to dress up the band as animals?

758
00:49:15,828 --> 00:49:18,708
- Oh, it don't cost nothin'.
- They're not animals...

759
00:49:18,868 --> 00:49:22,068
It's a way to fight the drabs.
We've got the drabs.

760
00:49:22,228 --> 00:49:26,348
That's true. I think mine would look better
in Dubly. If it was done in Dubly...

761
00:49:26,508 --> 00:49:28,108
Shut up!

762
00:49:28,268 --> 00:49:31,788
- If you're not open-minded enough...
- David...

763
00:49:31,948 --> 00:49:34,268
There are solutions to our problems.

764
00:49:34,428 --> 00:49:37,628
- I think we know what they are.
- I've yet to hear them.

765
00:49:37,788 --> 00:49:40,748
We can take a rational approach.
We can say...

766
00:49:40,908 --> 00:49:44,668
- May I make a suggestion?
- Oh, let's hear your suggestion.

767
00:49:44,828 --> 00:49:47,228
Stonehenge. Stonehenge.

768
00:49:47,388 --> 00:49:49,388
Best production value we've ever had.

769
00:49:49,548 --> 00:49:53,228
But we haven't got the equipment.
We haven't got Stonehenge.

770
00:49:53,388 --> 00:49:55,188
Please, please. Just a moment.

771
00:49:55,348 --> 00:49:58,588
- Musically, we all know it.
- It's not a bad idea.

772
00:49:58,748 --> 00:50:03,148
No problems musically.
We go right onstage and it's quite simple.

773
00:50:03,308 --> 00:50:05,308
lan can take care of this.

774
00:50:05,948 --> 00:50:09,148
But we don't have
that piece of scenery any more.

775
00:50:09,308 --> 00:50:11,748
I know! So we build a new one.

776
00:50:12,708 --> 00:50:16,428
- And this is it.
- Consider it done.

777
00:50:16,588 --> 00:50:20,348
You're just gonna take care of it like that?
Using that as the plans?

778
00:50:20,508 --> 00:50:22,628
- Let's try.
- If you can do it, I'll do the number.

779
00:50:23,388 --> 00:50:25,828
Do you feel that,
in collaboration with David,

780
00:50:25,988 --> 00:50:30,228
that you are afforded the opportunity
to express yourself musically

781
00:50:30,388 --> 00:50:33,748
- The way you would like to?
- Well, I think I do, in my solos.

782
00:50:33,908 --> 00:50:35,428
My solos are my trademark.

783
00:51:20,788 --> 00:51:23,028
Perfect. It's the right proportions.

784
00:51:23,108 --> 00:51:25,028
- It'll be this colour, right?
- Yeah.

785
00:51:25,188 --> 00:51:28,428
That's just terrific.
It almost looks like the real thing.

786
00:51:28,588 --> 00:51:29,948
- You got it.
- Yeah.

787
00:51:30,108 --> 00:51:31,868
When we get the actual set,

788
00:51:32,028 --> 00:51:35,788
it'll follow exactly these specifications?
Even these contours?

789
00:51:35,948 --> 00:51:39,428
Um... I don't understand you.
The actual piece?

790
00:51:39,588 --> 00:51:44,028
- When you build the actual piece...
- But this is what you asked for, isn't it?

791
00:51:44,188 --> 00:51:46,668
- What?
- Well, this is the piece.

792
00:51:46,828 --> 00:51:48,828
- This is the piece?
- Yes.

793
00:51:48,988 --> 00:51:53,668
Are you telling me that this is it?
This is scenery?

794
00:51:53,828 --> 00:51:55,748
Have you ever been to Stonehenge?

795
00:51:55,908 --> 00:51:59,788
The triptychs are 20 feet high!
You can stand four men up 'em!

796
00:51:59,948 --> 00:52:03,388
lan, I was asked to build it 18 inches high!

797
00:52:03,548 --> 00:52:06,308
Look. This is what I was asked to build.

798
00:52:06,468 --> 00:52:09,988
18 inches. Right here.
It's specified, 18 inches.

799
00:52:10,148 --> 00:52:13,468
- I was given this napkin.
- Forget this! Fuck the napkin!

800
00:52:18,308 --> 00:52:20,508
In ancient times,

801
00:52:22,188 --> 00:52:26,108
hundreds of years
before the dawn of history,

802
00:52:27,548 --> 00:52:30,468
lived an ancient race of people.

803
00:52:32,828 --> 00:52:34,148
The Druids.

804
00:52:43,788 --> 00:52:46,348
No one knows who they were

805
00:52:48,228 --> 00:52:50,108
or

806
00:52:50,268 --> 00:52:52,588
what they were doing.

807
00:52:53,788 --> 00:52:56,348
But their legacy remains.

808
00:52:57,388 --> 00:52:59,308
Hewn

809
00:53:00,148 --> 00:53:02,588
into the living rock

810
00:53:02,748 --> 00:53:04,868
of Stonehenge.

811
00:53:16,308 --> 00:53:19,268
Stonehenge-where the demons dwell

812
00:53:19,428 --> 00:53:23,028
Where the banshees live
and they do live well

813
00:53:23,188 --> 00:53:26,388
Stonehenge-where a man is a man

814
00:53:26,548 --> 00:53:29,868
And the children dance
to the pipes of Pan

815
00:53:34,668 --> 00:53:36,668
And you, my love

816
00:53:36,828 --> 00:53:38,948
Won't you take my hand

817
00:53:40,788 --> 00:53:42,708
We'll go back in time

818
00:53:43,828 --> 00:53:46,148
To that mystic land

819
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:50,628
Where the dewdrops cry

820
00:53:51,028 --> 00:53:52,828
And the cats meow

821
00:53:54,308 --> 00:53:56,668
I will take you there

822
00:53:57,588 --> 00:54:00,388
I will show you how

823
00:54:16,708 --> 00:54:19,388
And, oh, how they danced,

824
00:54:19,548 --> 00:54:22,908
the little children of Stonehenge,

825
00:54:23,068 --> 00:54:27,028
beneath the haunted moon,

826
00:54:27,188 --> 00:54:30,348
for fear that daybreak

827
00:54:30,508 --> 00:54:33,428
might come too soon.

828
00:54:54,548 --> 00:54:58,588
The problem wasn't that the band was
down. The problem may have been

829
00:54:58,748 --> 00:55:04,268
that there was a Stonehenge monument
in danger of being crushed... by a dwarf.

830
00:55:04,428 --> 00:55:08,588
All right? That tended to understate
the hugeness of the object.

831
00:55:08,748 --> 00:55:13,068
- You're making too big a thing out of it.
- Making a big thing was the idea.

832
00:55:13,228 --> 00:55:15,788
Nigel gave me a drawing
that said 18 inches.

833
00:55:15,948 --> 00:55:16,868
I know...

834
00:55:17,028 --> 00:55:20,988
Whether he knows the difference between
feet and inches is not my problem.

835
00:55:21,148 --> 00:55:25,508
But you're not as confused as him. It's not
your job to be as confused as Nigel is.

836
00:55:25,668 --> 00:55:29,908
It's my job to do what I'm asked to do
by the creative element of this band.

837
00:55:30,068 --> 00:55:32,908
- The audience were laughing.
- So it became a comedy number.

838
00:55:33,068 --> 00:55:37,188
Yes, it fuckin' did, and it was not pleasant
to be part of the comedy onstage.

839
00:55:37,348 --> 00:55:39,668
Backstage, perhaps it was very amusing.

840
00:55:39,828 --> 00:55:43,588
Maybe we just fix the choreography,
keep the dwarf clear.

841
00:55:43,748 --> 00:55:46,068
- What do you mean?
- So he won't trod upon it.

842
00:55:46,228 --> 00:55:49,708
That's not the issue.
I think it's symptomatic of taking on more

843
00:55:49,868 --> 00:55:53,428
than you can, er... er... handle.

844
00:55:53,588 --> 00:55:56,348
It's not the first time
you've messed things up, is it?

845
00:55:56,508 --> 00:56:01,188
There have been some gaping holes
in the business end...

846
00:56:01,348 --> 00:56:05,628
Excuse me. This is a band meeting, right?
Are you here for some reason?

847
00:56:05,788 --> 00:56:09,108
- She's with me.
- Is she now in the band?

848
00:56:09,268 --> 00:56:11,348
I care what happens to the band.

849
00:56:11,508 --> 00:56:15,788
David, whenever a single ruffle comes
into this adolescent fantasy world

850
00:56:15,948 --> 00:56:18,188
you guys have built around yourself,

851
00:56:18,348 --> 00:56:21,308
you start screaming like a bunch
of poncey hairdressers!

852
00:56:21,468 --> 00:56:24,708
It's just a problem! It gets solved!

853
00:56:24,868 --> 00:56:29,908
It doesn't! If it got solved, that would be
all right, but it doesn't get solved.

854
00:56:30,068 --> 00:56:32,668
I mean, what got solved tonight?

855
00:56:32,828 --> 00:56:37,028
For one single thing that goes wrong,
a hundred things go right.

856
00:56:37,188 --> 00:56:39,228
Do you know what
I spend my time doing?

857
00:56:39,388 --> 00:56:43,148
I sleep two or three hours a night.
There's no sex and drugs for lan, David.

858
00:56:43,308 --> 00:56:45,228
You know what I do?
I find lost luggage.

859
00:56:45,388 --> 00:56:47,948
I locate mandolin strings
in the middle of Austin.

860
00:56:48,108 --> 00:56:50,268
I prise the rent out of the local Hebrews.

861
00:56:50,428 --> 00:56:53,188
Get someone else to find luggage,

862
00:56:53,348 --> 00:56:55,828
and you concentrate on the stage.

863
00:56:55,988 --> 00:57:00,188
- You'd like me to be road manager?
- No! All bad blood aside...

864
00:57:00,348 --> 00:57:03,828
What Dave is trying to say,
if you'd let him get a word through,

865
00:57:03,988 --> 00:57:08,868
- Is you could maybe do with some help.
- Some help?

866
00:57:09,028 --> 00:57:11,508
- Managing the band.
- It's very simple.

867
00:57:11,668 --> 00:57:15,268
Maybe there's someone already here...
We don't have to pay insurance.

868
00:57:15,428 --> 00:57:19,388
We don't have to pay extra room...
since she's already here, among us,

869
00:57:19,548 --> 00:57:23,468
- And she's capable of taking over.
- "She"? Wait a minute.

870
00:57:23,628 --> 00:57:25,748
Who do you think I'm talking about?

871
00:57:25,908 --> 00:57:28,948
I would never have dreamed
it was her you were talking about.

872
00:57:29,188 --> 00:57:31,668
I am offering to help out here.

873
00:57:31,828 --> 00:57:34,308
You're offering to co-manage
the band with me.

874
00:57:34,468 --> 00:57:36,868
Yes, that is exactly it.

875
00:57:37,028 --> 00:57:41,068
I'm not gonna co-manage with some girl
just cos she's your girlfriend!

876
00:57:41,228 --> 00:57:45,628
Oh! "Girlfriend", is it? I don't know
what you're doing managing the band!

877
00:57:45,788 --> 00:57:48,228
- Why don't we just...
- Shut up!

878
00:57:48,388 --> 00:57:52,308
This is my position. I am not managing it
with you or any other woman.

879
00:57:52,468 --> 00:57:56,188
Especially one who dresses like an
Australian's nightmare. So fuck you!

880
00:57:56,348 --> 00:58:00,588
Fuck all of you! Because I quit, all right?
That's it. Good night.

881
00:58:10,068 --> 00:58:13,508
Can I raise a practical question
at this point?

882
00:58:13,668 --> 00:58:15,708
Are we gonna do Stonehenge tomorrow?

883
00:58:15,868 --> 00:58:18,908
No, we're not gonna
fuckin' do Stonehenge!

884
00:58:19,068 --> 00:58:21,468
OK, we're all set. Thank you.

885
00:58:21,868 --> 00:58:27,468
All right, fellas. I got the tickets. We're on
the 3.10 flight at gate 24, all right?

886
00:58:27,628 --> 00:58:32,188
It arrives at 4 o'clock in Colorado. Then
we got a limo to take us to the Lodge.

887
00:58:32,348 --> 00:58:35,028
It's about 100 yards
from Rainbow Trout Studio.

888
00:58:35,188 --> 00:58:39,668
What I've done is to arrange
a whole load of charts.

889
00:58:39,828 --> 00:58:44,388
- This is so great.
- We know that the band's sign is Virgo.

890
00:58:44,548 --> 00:58:49,188
You see, Saturn's in the third house,
and it's a bit rocky.

891
00:58:49,348 --> 00:58:54,988
But because Virgo is one of the most
highly intelligent signs of the zodiac,

892
00:58:55,148 --> 00:58:57,948
we're gonna pull through this
with great aplomb.

893
00:58:58,108 --> 00:58:59,548
Has someone not got one?

894
00:58:59,708 --> 00:59:04,588
Nigel hasn't got one.
Nigel! Nigel! We got pages for you here.

895
00:59:05,428 --> 00:59:07,348
He's got one. He's got it.

896
00:59:07,508 --> 00:59:10,668
Think what a jumble
a tour book usually is...

897
00:59:10,828 --> 00:59:12,748
- He's got one.
- Right.

898
00:59:12,908 --> 00:59:16,268
What I want to explain to you
is that Denver...

899
00:59:16,948 --> 00:59:20,868
How would you characterise your
relationship with David over the years?

900
00:59:21,028 --> 00:59:23,468
- Has it changed in any way?
- Not really.

901
00:59:23,628 --> 00:59:28,828
I mean, you know, we've grown up...
but really it's not...

902
00:59:28,988 --> 00:59:33,108
No, not really.
We feel like children much of the time,

903
00:59:33,268 --> 00:59:35,428
even when we're playing.

904
00:59:35,588 --> 00:59:37,908
We're closer than brothers.

905
00:59:38,548 --> 00:59:40,468
Brothers always fight.

906
00:59:40,628 --> 00:59:43,628
Sort of... disagreements and all that.

907
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:47,628
We really have a relationship that's way,
way past that.

908
00:59:53,628 --> 00:59:56,748
- He can't play any more.
- You know the parts.

909
00:59:56,908 --> 00:59:59,788
If he knew the fuckin' part,
he'd play it, wouldn't he?

910
00:59:59,948 --> 01:00:04,508
- Are you walking out? Great!
- Just tell me what we're supposed to do.

911
01:00:04,668 --> 01:00:07,068
We're supposed to play the fuckin' thing!

912
01:00:07,228 --> 01:00:09,908
- We've spent an hour and a half...
- I'm doing my part!

913
01:00:10,068 --> 01:00:13,628
You know what would make this a lot
simpler? I hate to cut right to it here.

914
01:00:13,788 --> 01:00:18,268
Why don't you play this alone, without
some angel hanging over your head?

915
01:00:18,428 --> 01:00:21,228
Jesus Christ!
This is fuckin' all we need.

916
01:00:21,388 --> 01:00:24,828
You can't fuckin' concentrate
because of your fuckin' wife!

917
01:00:24,988 --> 01:00:27,188
- It's your fuckin' wife!
- She's not my wife.

918
01:00:27,348 --> 01:00:31,188
Whatever the fuck she is,
we can't fuckin' do the track!

919
01:00:31,348 --> 01:00:34,868
- This is unbelievable!
- No, it's not unbelievable at all!

920
01:00:35,028 --> 01:00:38,988
Am I losing my fuckin' mind?!
Could you check me on this?

921
01:00:39,148 --> 01:00:41,708
I don't understand
what this has to do with anything!

922
01:00:41,868 --> 01:00:46,628
We're very lucky, in a sense,
that we've got two visionaries in the band.

923
01:00:46,788 --> 01:00:49,348
David and Nigel are both like...

924
01:00:50,228 --> 01:00:53,068
Like poets,
like Shelley or Byron or people like that.

925
01:00:53,548 --> 01:00:56,388
They're two totally distinct
types of visionaries.

926
01:00:56,548 --> 01:00:58,908
It's like fire and ice, basically.

927
01:00:59,068 --> 01:01:02,468
I feel my role in the band is to be
kind of in the middle of that,

928
01:01:02,628 --> 01:01:04,628
kind of like lukewarm water, in a sense.

929
01:01:10,148 --> 01:01:12,348
SEATTLE, WASHINGTON

930
01:01:12,508 --> 01:01:16,748
There's no time to go to the hotel.
You'd better go straight to the base.

931
01:01:16,908 --> 01:01:18,668
- Base?
- The gig.

932
01:01:18,828 --> 01:01:22,068
- To the Civic Arena, right?
- No.

933
01:01:22,228 --> 01:01:27,868
Wait a second. Hold it. Do you know
about this and we don't know about this?

934
01:01:28,028 --> 01:01:31,548
- We're going to the air-force base.
- Why go to an air-force base?

935
01:01:31,708 --> 01:01:33,828
Because the original gig fell through!

936
01:01:38,508 --> 01:01:40,708
- Lieutenant Hookstrat?
- Hookstratten.

937
01:01:40,868 --> 01:01:45,068
- You are Spinal Tarp?
- I'm Jeanine and this is Spinal Tap.

938
01:01:45,228 --> 01:01:49,468
Spinal Tap. I'm Bob Hookstratten.
Welcome to Lindbergh Air Force Base.

939
01:01:49,628 --> 01:01:52,468
Is this your first visit
to a military facility?

940
01:01:52,628 --> 01:01:55,588
May I start by saying
how thrilled we are to have you here.

941
01:01:55,748 --> 01:01:58,828
We are such fans of your music
and all of your records.

942
01:01:58,988 --> 01:02:02,228
Not yours personally,
but the whole genre of rock'n'roll

943
01:02:02,388 --> 01:02:04,588
and the exciting things in music today.

944
01:02:04,748 --> 01:02:08,908
Let me explain what's going on.
This is our monthly at ease weekend.

945
01:02:09,548 --> 01:02:13,668
It gives us a chance to let down our hair,
although I see you have a head start!

946
01:02:13,828 --> 01:02:16,268
These haircuts wouldn't pass
military muster!

947
01:02:16,468 --> 01:02:18,788
My hair's getting a little shaggy, too.

948
01:02:18,948 --> 01:02:23,468
Better not get too close. They'll think
I'm in the band! I'm joking, of course.

949
01:02:24,468 --> 01:02:27,028
Walk this way, please.
Right through here.

950
01:02:27,188 --> 01:02:31,588
Did you ever run into a group, works out
of Kansas City - Four Jacks And A Jill?

951
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:38,068
If you're ever there and wanna hear some
good music, you might wanna drop by.

952
01:02:38,228 --> 01:02:43,628
I would like to get the playing on
about 1900 hours, if that's satisfactory.

953
01:02:43,788 --> 01:02:47,468
- When would that be?
- I make it now... it's about 1830 hours.

954
01:02:47,628 --> 01:02:50,428
- So that's what? 50 hours?
- 120 hours?

955
01:02:50,588 --> 01:02:53,828
That's actually about 30 minutes...
give or take a few minutes.

956
01:02:53,988 --> 01:02:57,828
I don't wanna rush you. The idea is
we can get it on and we get it over with.

957
01:02:57,988 --> 01:03:01,108
And would you play a couple
of slow numbers so I can dance?

958
01:03:01,268 --> 01:03:03,468
Working on a sex farm

959
01:03:05,628 --> 01:03:08,628
Ploughing through your bean field

960
01:03:09,748 --> 01:03:12,308
Gettin' out my pitchfork

961
01:03:13,708 --> 01:03:15,788
Pokin' your hay

962
01:03:17,588 --> 01:03:21,828
Sex farm woman,
I'm gonna mow you down

963
01:03:21,988 --> 01:03:25,908
Sex farm woman,
I'll rake and hoe you down

964
01:03:26,068 --> 01:03:30,388
Sex farm woman,
don't you see my silo risin' high?

965
01:03:30,548 --> 01:03:32,468
High, high, high

966
01:03:32,908 --> 01:03:35,548
Hi-i-i-i-gh...

967
01:03:54,388 --> 01:03:56,588
Working on a sex farm

968
01:03:58,788 --> 01:04:01,908
Tryin' to raise some hard love

969
01:04:03,028 --> 01:04:05,588
Gettin' out my pitchfork

970
01:04:13,908 --> 01:04:17,268
He totally ruined the gig there.
He walks off and then...

971
01:04:17,428 --> 01:04:21,708
He can't sit at home and get money.
We gotta get someone else in there.

972
01:04:21,868 --> 01:04:24,868
Has he done this before?
Has he quit the band before?

973
01:04:25,028 --> 01:04:28,788
No, but you gotta understand that,
in the world of rock'n'roll,

974
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:32,388
there are certain changes
that sometimes occur.

975
01:04:32,548 --> 01:04:35,268
And you've just got to
sort of roll with them.

976
01:04:35,428 --> 01:04:39,868
You saw exactly how many people
have been in this band over the years.

977
01:04:40,028 --> 01:04:42,228
37 people have been in this band
over the years.

978
01:04:42,908 --> 01:04:46,388
I mean, six months from now,
I can't see myself missing Nige

979
01:04:46,548 --> 01:04:49,948
any more than I might miss
Ross McLachness

980
01:04:50,108 --> 01:04:53,828
or Ronnie Pudding or Danny Uppam
or Danny Schindler or any of those.

981
01:04:53,988 --> 01:05:00,068
I can't believe that. I can't believe that
you're lumping Nigel in with

982
01:05:01,028 --> 01:05:03,508
the people you played with
for a short time.

983
01:05:03,668 --> 01:05:08,188
Well, I'd feel much worse if I weren't
under such heavy sedation, but

984
01:05:08,348 --> 01:05:11,348
you've gotta be realistic
about this sort of thing.

985
01:05:11,508 --> 01:05:13,588
So what happens to the band now?

986
01:05:14,548 --> 01:05:16,788
- What do you mean?
- He's not coming back or...

987
01:05:16,948 --> 01:05:19,668
No. We shan't work together again.

988
01:05:22,708 --> 01:05:26,828
THEMELAND AMUSEMENT PARK
Stockton, California

989
01:05:28,148 --> 01:05:29,508
- Oh, no.
- Great.

990
01:05:29,668 --> 01:05:32,828
If I told them once,
I told them a hundred times

991
01:05:32,988 --> 01:05:36,308
to put Spinal Tap first
and Puppet Show last.

992
01:05:36,468 --> 01:05:38,548
It's a morale builder, isn't it?

993
01:05:38,708 --> 01:05:41,788
You got a big dressing room...
You got a big dressing room.

994
01:05:41,948 --> 01:05:44,988
A bigger dressing room than the puppets?
That's refreshing.

995
01:05:45,148 --> 01:05:48,668
I've got some of this Mendocino rocket
fuel that's supposed to be really nice.

996
01:05:48,828 --> 01:05:52,548
Can you play... Excuse me, Viv.
Can you play a bass line

997
01:05:52,708 --> 01:05:54,988
like Nigel used to on Big Bottom?

998
01:05:55,148 --> 01:05:57,868
Can you double that?
You remember it? It's in fifths.

999
01:05:58,028 --> 01:05:59,988
Oh, yeah, yeah. I got two hands here.

1000
01:06:00,148 --> 01:06:04,148
- So we can play that one.
- Hole is out, Heavy is out.

1001
01:06:04,308 --> 01:06:06,228
Right, right, right, right.

1002
01:06:06,388 --> 01:06:09,428
America we can't do. It's Nigel's tune.
It's not my tune.

1003
01:06:09,588 --> 01:06:12,988
- That's a nice, cosy ten-minute set.
- What are we gonna do?

1004
01:06:13,148 --> 01:06:16,308
- We got nothing to play.
- I'll tell you what we're gonna do.

1005
01:06:16,468 --> 01:06:19,148
- What?
- Jazz Odyssey.

1006
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:25,348
We're not about to do a free-form jazz
exploration in front of a festival crowd.

1007
01:06:26,348 --> 01:06:31,588
You are witnesses at the new birth
of Spinal Tap, Mark 2.

1008
01:06:34,388 --> 01:06:36,948
Hope you enjoy our new direction.

1009
01:06:56,348 --> 01:06:59,868
On the bass - Derek Smalls.
He wrote this.

1010
01:07:06,988 --> 01:07:08,908
END OF TOUR PARTY
Los Angeles

1011
01:07:09,068 --> 01:07:11,628
So tonight's the last show of the tour.

1012
01:07:11,748 --> 01:07:14,828
Is this your last waltz?
Are we talking the end of Spinal Tap

1013
01:07:14,988 --> 01:07:17,948
or are you gonna try to milk it
for a few more years in Europe?

1014
01:07:18,108 --> 01:07:23,508
Well, I don't really think that the end...
can be assessed... er...

1015
01:07:23,668 --> 01:07:25,988
as of itself as being the end.

1016
01:07:26,148 --> 01:07:29,188
What does the end feel like?
It's like saying when you try

1017
01:07:29,348 --> 01:07:31,748
to extrapolate the end of the universe.

1018
01:07:31,908 --> 01:07:35,628
If the universe is indeed infinite,
then what does that mean?

1019
01:07:35,788 --> 01:07:39,628
How far is all the way?
And then if it stops, what's stopping it?

1020
01:07:39,788 --> 01:07:44,828
And what's behind what's stopping it?
"What's the end?" is my question to you.

1021
01:07:44,988 --> 01:07:47,628
- It's a good crowd, good crowd.
- It is, isn't it?

1022
01:07:47,788 --> 01:07:50,188
Yeah. Some of these things,
you know, don't mean much.

1023
01:07:50,348 --> 01:07:54,828
It's hard to get at the last minute.
You can't arrange it all overnight.

1024
01:07:54,988 --> 01:07:57,068
David, we had a 15-year ride, mate.

1025
01:07:57,228 --> 01:08:00,588
Who wants to be
a 45-year-old rock'n'roller farting around

1026
01:08:00,748 --> 01:08:03,188
in front of people less than half their age,

1027
01:08:03,308 --> 01:08:07,588
cranking out some mediocre
head-banging bullshit we've forgotten?

1028
01:08:07,748 --> 01:08:11,348
- It's beneath us. Who wants to see that?
- Absolutely right.

1029
01:08:11,508 --> 01:08:15,308
We can take all those projects
we didn't have time for.

1030
01:08:15,468 --> 01:08:19,628
We didn't have time because of Tap.
Bring 'em back to life, maybe.

1031
01:08:19,748 --> 01:08:22,308
- Do you remember what...
- At the Luton Palace,

1032
01:08:22,468 --> 01:08:26,628
we were talking about a rock musical
based on the life of Jack the Ripper.

1033
01:08:26,748 --> 01:08:29,268
- Yeah. Saucy Jack.
- Now is the time to do that.

1034
01:08:29,428 --> 01:08:31,588
- You're a naughty one
- Saucy Jack

1035
01:08:31,748 --> 01:08:33,908
You're a haughty one, Saucy Jack

1036
01:08:34,068 --> 01:08:36,828
It's a freeing up, innit?
It's all this free time.

1037
01:08:36,988 --> 01:08:39,908
- Suddenly time is so elastic.
- It's a gift. A gift of freedom.

1038
01:08:40,068 --> 01:08:43,668
I've always wanted to do
a collection of my acoustic numbers

1039
01:08:43,788 --> 01:08:46,588
with the London Philharmonic,
as you know.

1040
01:08:46,748 --> 01:08:50,148
We're lucky.
People should be envying us, you know.

1041
01:08:50,268 --> 01:08:53,028
- I envy us.
- Yeah. Me too.

1042
01:09:00,548 --> 01:09:02,748
It's gonna be fine, right?

1043
01:09:03,908 --> 01:09:06,828
- We'll make 'em miss us.
- Nice thought.

1044
01:09:08,908 --> 01:09:11,548
I'm in. I'm in tune.

1045
01:09:11,708 --> 01:09:15,308
- The last tuning.
- I think we should go in.

1046
01:09:15,468 --> 01:09:17,868
I think it's time to go, right?

1047
01:09:18,028 --> 01:09:20,748
- Wanna go?
- Yeah.

1048
01:09:20,948 --> 01:09:25,388
We're gonna do Reach Out When You Die
In My Champagne.

1049
01:09:39,468 --> 01:09:41,708
Come to see the show?

1050
01:09:42,108 --> 01:09:45,628
- Yeah. Hello, mate.
- Nige.

1051
01:09:49,468 --> 01:09:52,628
So did you just come here
to hang around backstage?

1052
01:09:52,748 --> 01:09:56,108
- Is that what you're doin'?
- I'm really a messenger.

1053
01:09:56,268 --> 01:09:59,268
- Oh, a messenger.
- Yeah. I bumped into lan and, er...

1054
01:09:59,428 --> 01:10:00,908
lan?

1055
01:10:01,068 --> 01:10:02,988
Oh, the other dead man, yeah.

1056
01:10:03,148 --> 01:10:08,268
Seems that Sex Farm
is on the charts in Japan.

1057
01:10:08,428 --> 01:10:10,628
Spinal Tap's recording of Sex Farm?

1058
01:10:10,748 --> 01:10:13,748
It was at number five last week, actually.

1059
01:10:13,908 --> 01:10:16,868
So he asked me

1060
01:10:18,188 --> 01:10:21,428
to ask you, Tap,

1061
01:10:21,588 --> 01:10:24,308
if you'd be interested in re-forming

1062
01:10:24,468 --> 01:10:27,908
and, er... doing a tour. Japan.

1063
01:10:28,428 --> 01:10:31,588
So you've come back to re-plug
our life-support systems in?

1064
01:10:31,748 --> 01:10:35,548
By the grace of your...
By the stroke of your hand...

1065
01:10:35,708 --> 01:10:38,788
You're gonna bring us back to life?
Is that why you've come?

1066
01:10:38,948 --> 01:10:42,268
- No, I've come...
- I mean... The fuckin'...

1067
01:10:42,428 --> 01:10:45,388
nerve that you've displayed...

1068
01:10:45,548 --> 01:10:48,788
I'm just passing on the information, really.

1069
01:10:48,948 --> 01:10:53,668
Well, it's time to go in. We haven't got
time to discuss this now. Come on.

1070
01:11:19,748 --> 01:11:21,748
David,

1071
01:11:22,108 --> 01:11:24,188
do a good show, all right?

1072
01:11:25,428 --> 01:11:27,348
Yeah, OK.

1073
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:54,188
Little girl, it's a great big world

1074
01:11:54,308 --> 01:11:56,268
But there's only one of me

1075
01:11:57,588 --> 01:11:59,468
You can't touch cos I cost too much

1076
01:11:59,628 --> 01:12:02,228
- But tonight I'm gonna rock you
- Tonight I'm gonna rock you

1077
01:12:02,388 --> 01:12:04,788
- Tonight I'm gonna rock you
- Tonight I'm gonna rock you

1078
01:12:04,948 --> 01:12:06,148
Tonight!

1079
01:12:15,548 --> 01:12:17,268
You're sweet but you're just four feet

1080
01:12:17,428 --> 01:12:19,628
And you still got your baby teeth

1081
01:12:20,628 --> 01:12:22,868
You're too young and I'm too well hung

1082
01:12:23,028 --> 01:12:25,468
- But tonight I'm gonna rock you
- Tonight I'm gonna rock you

1083
01:12:25,628 --> 01:12:28,028
- Tonight I'm gonna rock you
- Tonight I'm gonna rock you

1084
01:12:28,188 --> 01:12:30,108
Tonight!

1085
01:12:31,268 --> 01:12:33,188
Oh, yeah

1086
01:12:53,508 --> 01:12:55,868
Nigel Tufnel, lead guitar!

1087
01:13:18,548 --> 01:13:20,308
You're hot, you take all we've got

1088
01:13:20,468 --> 01:13:23,468
JOE "MAMA" BESSER
Drums

1089
01:13:23,628 --> 01:13:25,748
Next day, we'll be on our way

1090
01:13:25,908 --> 01:13:26,868
But tonight I'm gonna rock you

1091
01:13:27,028 --> 01:13:29,348
KOBE HALL
Tokyo, Japan

1092
01:13:29,508 --> 01:13:30,508
Tonight I'm gonna rock you

1093
01:13:30,668 --> 01:13:32,588
Tonight!

1094
01:13:40,788 --> 01:13:44,228
Little girl, it's a great big world
but there's only one of

1095
01:13:46,308 --> 01:13:48,708
Me!

1096
01:14:04,468 --> 01:14:07,788
Do you feel that playing rock'n'roll music

1097
01:14:07,948 --> 01:14:12,268
keeps you a child? Keeps you
in a state of arrested development?

1098
01:14:12,428 --> 01:14:14,908
No, no. I feel it's like...

1099
01:14:15,068 --> 01:14:18,188
It's more like going
to a national park or something,

1100
01:14:18,308 --> 01:14:20,508
and they've preserved the moose.

1101
01:14:20,668 --> 01:14:24,388
And that's... my childhood
up there onstage is that moose.

1102
01:14:24,548 --> 01:14:27,868
So when you're playing, you feel
like a preserved moose onstage?

1103
01:14:28,028 --> 01:14:32,628
I've been listening to the classics.
I belong to a great series.

1104
01:14:32,748 --> 01:14:35,428
It's called
The Namesake Series of cassettes.

1105
01:14:35,588 --> 01:14:40,228
They send you works of famous authors
done by actors with the same last name.

1106
01:14:40,388 --> 01:14:43,628
So I've got Denholm Elliott
reading TS Eliot on this one.

1107
01:14:43,748 --> 01:14:45,228
- Interesting.
- Yes.

1108
01:14:45,388 --> 01:14:49,108
I've got Danny Thomas doing A Child's
Christmas In Wales by Dylan Thomas.

1109
01:14:49,268 --> 01:14:54,428
Next month it's McLean Stevenson
reads Robert Louis Stevenson.

1110
01:14:54,588 --> 01:14:57,628
- Treasure Island, I believe.
- Interesting. Fascinating.

1111
01:14:57,748 --> 01:15:01,028
There's also the shorter works
of Washington Irving

1112
01:15:01,188 --> 01:15:03,388
read by someone called Dr J.

1113
01:15:03,548 --> 01:15:08,988
- That's Julius Irving.
- There you go, in keeping with the series.

1114
01:15:09,148 --> 01:15:11,268
- You like this?
- Looks like Halloween.

1115
01:15:11,428 --> 01:15:15,868
This is my exact inner structure
done in a T-shirt.

1116
01:15:16,028 --> 01:15:18,788
Exactly medically accurate, see?

1117
01:15:18,948 --> 01:15:22,188
So, if we were to take
all your flesh and blood...

1118
01:15:22,308 --> 01:15:26,188
- This is what you'd see.
- It wouldn't be green, though.

1119
01:15:26,308 --> 01:15:29,908
It is green.
See how your blood looks blue?

1120
01:15:30,068 --> 01:15:33,988
That's just the vein, the colour of the vein.
The blood is actually red.

1121
01:15:34,148 --> 01:15:37,748
Oh, maybe it's not green, then.
Anyway, this is what I sleep in.

1122
01:15:37,908 --> 01:15:43,068
Denis Eton-Hogg, President of Polymer
Records, was recently knighted.

1123
01:15:43,228 --> 01:15:46,508
What were the circumstances
surrounding his knighthood?

1124
01:15:46,668 --> 01:15:50,948
The specific reason why he was knighted
was for the founding of Hoggwood,

1125
01:15:51,108 --> 01:15:54,708
which is a summer camp
for pale young boys.

1126
01:15:56,548 --> 01:16:00,468
David St Hubbins. I must admit
I've never heard anybody with that name.

1127
01:16:00,628 --> 01:16:04,628
It's an unusual name. He was an unusual
saint. He's not a very well-known saint.

1128
01:16:04,748 --> 01:16:07,668
- Oh, there was a St Hubbins?
- Yes. That's right, yes.

1129
01:16:07,788 --> 01:16:11,468
- What was he the saint of?
- The patron saint of quality footwear.

1130
01:16:11,628 --> 01:16:16,668
You play to predominantly...
predominantly a white audience.

1131
01:16:16,788 --> 01:16:18,948
Do you feel your music
is racist in any way?

1132
01:16:19,108 --> 01:16:21,308
- No, of course not.
- No, not at all.

1133
01:16:21,468 --> 01:16:25,028
We say, "Love your brother."
We don't say it really, but...

1134
01:16:25,188 --> 01:16:28,268
We don't literally say it.
We don't literally mean it.

1135
01:16:28,428 --> 01:16:31,948
- We're not racists.
- But... that message should be clear.

1136
01:16:32,108 --> 01:16:33,508
We're anything but racists.

1137
01:16:33,668 --> 01:16:37,228
We've grown musically. You listen
to some of the rubbish we did early on.

1138
01:16:37,388 --> 01:16:39,428
It was stupid, and now we're...

1139
01:16:39,588 --> 01:16:43,908
I mean, a song like Sex Farm,
we're taking a sophisticated view

1140
01:16:44,068 --> 01:16:48,908
- Of the idea of sex and music.
- And putting it on a farm.

1141
01:16:49,068 --> 01:16:55,188
If I were to ask you your philosophy of life
or your creed, what would that be?

1142
01:16:55,308 --> 01:16:58,148
Have a good time

1143
01:16:58,988 --> 01:17:01,308
all the time.

1144
01:17:01,588 --> 01:17:03,508
That's my philosophy, Marty.

1145
01:17:03,668 --> 01:17:06,588
I believe virtually everything I read,
and I think that

1146
01:17:06,748 --> 01:17:12,028
is what makes me more selective than
someone who doesn't believe anything.

1147
01:17:12,188 --> 01:17:15,508
Do you have a philosophy
or a creed that you live by?

1148
01:17:15,668 --> 01:17:17,588
Well, personally,

1149
01:17:17,748 --> 01:17:21,308
I like to think about sex and drugs
and rock'n'roll. That's my life.

1150
01:17:21,468 --> 01:17:24,868
If you were to have something written
as your epitaph...

1151
01:17:26,188 --> 01:17:29,108
Here lies David St Hubbins,

1152
01:17:31,148 --> 01:17:33,548
and why not?

1153
01:17:34,388 --> 01:17:38,548
- You feel that sums up your life?
- No. It's the first thing I could think of.

1154
01:17:38,708 --> 01:17:40,628
It doesn't sum up anything, really.

1155
01:17:40,748 --> 01:17:43,748
I'm a real fish nut. I really like fish.

1156
01:17:43,908 --> 01:17:48,148
- What kind of fish?
- Well, in the United States, you have cod.

1157
01:17:48,268 --> 01:17:50,788
I like cod. And I love tuna.

1158
01:17:50,948 --> 01:17:54,508
Those little cans you've got here.
Tuna fish... I love that.

1159
01:17:54,668 --> 01:17:56,908
- No bones.
- Yeah.

1160
01:17:57,788 --> 01:18:01,028
If you could not play rock'n'roll,
what would you do?

1161
01:18:01,188 --> 01:18:03,028
I'd be a full-time dreamer.

1162
01:18:03,188 --> 01:18:06,988
I'd probably get a bit stupid and start
to make a fool of myself in public,

1163
01:18:07,148 --> 01:18:08,988
cos there wouldn't be a stage.

1164
01:18:09,148 --> 01:18:11,068
Probably work with children.

1165
01:18:11,948 --> 01:18:16,508
As long as there's, you know, sex and
drugs, I can do without the rock'n'roll.

1166
01:18:18,188 --> 01:18:24,468
Well, I suppose I could work in a shop
of some kind, or do freelance selling

1167
01:18:24,628 --> 01:18:27,188
of some sort of product.

1168
01:18:27,308 --> 01:18:30,908
- A salesman?
- Like, maybe in a haberdasher,

1169
01:18:31,068 --> 01:18:35,428
or maybe like a... um...
a chapeau shop or something.

1170
01:18:36,468 --> 01:18:40,868
You know, "What size do you wear, sir?"
and then you answer me.

1171
01:18:41,028 --> 01:18:44,508
- Seven and a quarter.
- "I think we have that."

1172
01:18:44,668 --> 01:18:46,588
Something like that I could do.

1173
01:18:46,748 --> 01:18:50,268
- You think you'd be happy...
- "No, we're all out. Do you wear black?"

1174
01:18:50,428 --> 01:18:53,148
See, that sort of thing
I think I could muster up.

1175
01:18:53,268 --> 01:18:56,148
Do you think you'd be happy doing that?

1176
01:18:56,268 --> 01:18:58,548
I don't know. What are the hours?

1177
01:18:58,708 --> 01:18:59,628
