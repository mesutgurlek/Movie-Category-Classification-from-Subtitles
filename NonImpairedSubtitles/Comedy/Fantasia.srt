3
00:00:56,081 --> 00:00:58,249
How do you do?

4
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:01,252
It's my very pleasant duty
to welcome you here...

5
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:05,757
...on behalf of Walt Disney, Leopold Stokowski
and all the other artists...

6
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:10,970
...and musicians whose combined talents
went into the creation of this new form of entertainment...

7
00:01:11,012 --> 00:01:14,724
..."Fantasia"

8
00:01:14,766 --> 00:01:18,937
What you are going to see, are the designs
and pictures and stories...

9
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,191
...that music inspired in the minds
and imaginations of a group of artists.

10
00:01:24,776 --> 00:01:28,947
In other words they're not going to be
the interpretations of trained musicians.

11
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:31,491
Which I think is all to the good.

12
00:01:31,533 --> 00:01:37,455
So now we present the "Toccata and Fugue
in D minor" by Johann Sebastian Bach...

13
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:41,084
...interpreted in pictures
by Walt Disney and his associates...

14
00:01:41,126 --> 00:01:47,382
...and the music by the Philadelphia Orchestra
and its conductor Leopold Stokowski.

15
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:40,141
You know it's funny how wrong
an artist can be about his own work.

16
00:11:40,183 --> 00:11:45,647
Now, the one composition of Tchaikovsky's
that he really detested was his Nutcracker suite.

17
00:11:45,689 --> 00:11:48,149
Which is probably the most popular
thing he ever wrote.

18
00:11:48,191 --> 00:11:51,903
Incidentally, you won't see
any nutcracker on the screen.

19
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:56,116
There is nothing like to him
but the title.

20
00:26:25,735 --> 00:26:29,781
And now we are going to hear
a piece of music that tells a very definite story.

21
00:26:29,823 --> 00:26:33,827
It's a very old story,
one that goes back almost 2000 years.

22
00:26:33,868 --> 00:26:37,580
A legend about a sorcerer
who had an apprentice.

23
00:26:37,622 --> 00:26:40,834
He was a bright young lad,
very anxious to learn the business.

24
00:26:40,875 --> 00:26:43,545
As a matter of fact,
he was a little bit too bright...

25
00:26:43,586 --> 00:26:47,716
...because he started practising
some of the boss's best magic tricks...

26
00:26:47,757 --> 00:26:50,093
...before learning how to control them.

27
00:36:11,321 --> 00:36:15,492
Mister Stokowski, Mister Stokowski...

28
00:36:17,077 --> 00:36:20,163
My congratulations, sir.

29
00:36:20,205 --> 00:36:24,376
- Congratulations to you, Mickey.
- Gee, thanks.

30
00:36:24,793 --> 00:36:26,419
Well, so long!

31
00:36:26,461 --> 00:36:29,130
I'll be seeing you.

32
00:36:29,172 --> 00:36:33,343
Good-bye.
