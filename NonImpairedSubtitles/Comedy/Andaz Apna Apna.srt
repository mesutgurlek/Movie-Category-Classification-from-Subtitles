1
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:41,709
Excuse me! Can I help you?

2
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:54,083
Goodness!
It's Juhi Chawla!

3
00:02:54,084 --> 00:02:57,958
I've to attend a shoot and
my car's broken down.

4
00:02:58,416 --> 00:03:01,875
Can you give me a lift?

5
00:03:02,292 --> 00:03:06,750
I?!
Why not? Please come!

6
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:12,667
I'm very fortunate to have found you.

7
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,249
I'll never forget this favor of
yours for the rest of my life.

8
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,415
No favor at all!
This is only my duty.

9
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:23,416
They don't 'make' them
like you anymore.

10
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:33,875
Madam's arrived!
Hurry up!

11
00:03:40,667 --> 00:03:47,125
You will meet me again, won't you?

12
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,582
Why did you summon me
so suddenly, Miss Juhi?

13
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:57,999
There was no reason, really.
I just felt like meeting you.

14
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,707
It's a very romantic place, isn't it?

15
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:05,417
Yes, it is.

16
00:04:13,084 --> 00:04:16,917
There are times when I think of
the fate that would befall me...

17
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:21,415
...if I didn't have these strong
shoulders supporting me.

18
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:26,249
Give me your word... you
will always be with me!

19
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,749
What's this you're saying, Miss Juhi?

20
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,042
Not 'Miss Juhi'... simply Juhi!

21
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:41,415
- Goodness! Govinda?!
- Who are you?

22
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:44,792
Meet Mr. Amar, Govinda.

23
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,707
Haven't I told you about him?

24
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:50,833
So, he's the one who helped
you at every step, eh?

25
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:55,249
You're a very handsome young man.

26
00:04:55,250 --> 00:05:00,292
Your tastes are improving, Juhi!

27
00:05:00,917 --> 00:05:02,415
She's feeling shy...

28
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:05,916
Listen, when you're so handsome,
why don't you try a career in films?

29
00:05:05,917 --> 00:05:10,792
I've received many offers.
But I'm being selective...

30
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:21,707
Come into my arms!

31
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:24,207
No, Gopal!
This can't be!

32
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,415
Why not?
Only because I'm poor?

33
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:29,166
And you're rich? No power
on earth can keep us apart!

34
00:05:29,167 --> 00:05:31,415
Come into my arms!

35
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:34,999
But try to understand a
woman's helplessness, Gopal!

36
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,415
This heartless world...

37
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:40,458
...this world full of enemies will not let us live.

38
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,083
- And that is the truth.
- The truth is that you love me!

39
00:05:44,084 --> 00:05:46,707
You love me and I love you.
Only this is true...

40
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:49,624
...the rest is fake! Forget it!
Come and embrace me!

41
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:55,875
Embrace her tightly, Govinda!

42
00:05:56,917 --> 00:06:02,166
- What happened?!
- I felt Shah Rukh Khan had arrived!

43
00:06:03,084 --> 00:06:06,792
Shah Rukh Khan, Sunny Deol, Govinda
...they're the ones in your life!

44
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:11,833
I'm told you're doing many films with Sunny?

45
00:06:11,834 --> 00:06:15,917
Yes.
People like us paired together.

46
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:19,958
- And you?
- I like it, too.

47
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:22,415
He's very handsome.

48
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:25,582
Why did you ask?
Are you feeling jealous?

49
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,415
I'm afraid I might kill someone!

50
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:30,666
You're upset?

51
00:06:30,667 --> 00:06:34,290
I was only joking.
You're everything to me...

52
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:37,582
...you're my beloved.

53
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:42,582
It's true, Amar.
I can't live without you now.

54
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,749
Let's get married somewhere.

55
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:48,124
- Oh yes!
- I'll quit acting for you!

56
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:50,624
No!
There's no need to do that!

57
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:53,708
Go ahead and act. I'll handle
everything, including the money!

58
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:57,875
But I'll choose your lead-men.
And you must maintain a distance!

59
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:07,457
I treat God as witness and...

60
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:13,457
...accept you with all my heart and soul.

61
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,749
I too treat God as witness and...

62
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:21,666
...accept you with heart, soul and wealth!

63
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:25,582
Oh, Dad!
You ruined my beautiful dream!

64
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:28,749
Did you have to arrive just as
I was about to marry the heroine?

65
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,916
- Couldn't you wait for 2 minutes?
- Shut up and get up!

66
00:07:31,917 --> 00:07:33,833
He sits at the cash-counter and goes to sleep.

67
00:07:33,834 --> 00:07:36,916
Haven't I told you, Babulal, not
to let him near the cash-counter?

68
00:07:36,917 --> 00:07:39,749
How much of money does your
cash-counter have anyway?

69
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:43,499
A beggar of Bombay would have
more loose change than you do!

70
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,750
Be careful, Babulal. Don't cut his
ear off, like you did yesterday.

71
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:49,582
- Careful!
- How can currency notes be here?

72
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:51,749
He took a hundred rupees
yesterday and blew it up!

73
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,791
Not blew it up,
I 'spent' it.

74
00:07:53,792 --> 00:07:56,082
I had a haircut at
Taj Mahal's saloon yesterday.

75
00:07:56,083 --> 00:08:02,417
What?! I shave a hundred people
to put together Rs. 100/...

76
00:08:02,834 --> 00:08:06,750
...and you tip people at the Taj?!
Your hair hasn't been cut, too!

77
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:13,583
They've been cut in a style you can never tell.

78
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:16,582
Speaking a lot of English, eh?

79
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:21,041
You fool! It was with the 'change'
from this cash-counter that I...

80
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:25,792
...got you educated with;
threats and intimidation's.

81
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:28,207
I somehow got you into college, too.

82
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:31,290
But they even kicked you out of there!

83
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:34,207
I wasn't kicked out...
I quit on my own!

84
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:37,916
In fact, the Principal couldn't
understand what I said.

85
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:42,000
I have many ideas in my
brains... dying to pop out!

86
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:46,083
They're meant for the nation,
and for this generation...

87
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:48,457
And especially so, for the fathers!

88
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:52,083
Because, till the parent does not
improve, the nation cannot, too!

89
00:08:52,834 --> 00:08:55,332
The Principal's son could understand this...

90
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:56,999
...but the Principal couldn't.

91
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,249
But you...

92
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,499
I'll shave off your hair
without even applying water!

93
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,999
Oh come on, Pop!

94
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,040
If you shave my hair, people'll think you've...

95
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:08,500
- Shut up, donkey!
- Peace, father, peace...

96
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:11,666
I have a new idea.
Why don't we sell this shop?

97
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:13,040
We'll get good money.

98
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:17,542
I mean, we can open a
bangles-shop with that money.

99
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:21,500
- A bangles-shop?
- Yes. A bangles-shop.

100
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,457
Just imagine...

101
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:26,917
...we'll be surrounded by beautiful faces all day.

102
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,416
I'll make the daughter's try out the bangles...

103
00:09:30,417 --> 00:09:33,582
...while you will be busy with the mothers.

104
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:36,792
The sound of laughter...
and the meeting of eyes...

105
00:09:37,417 --> 00:09:42,249
...the spread of their tresses
and the slipping of their veils!

106
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:46,834
Their pretty and delicate hands
will be in your fat, ugly paws!

107
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,040
You'll very lovingly make
them wear the bangles.

108
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:51,541
They'll gracefully make sounds of protest.

109
00:09:51,542 --> 00:09:55,749
You will, meanwhile, make noises of mischief!

110
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:59,249
I told you to take care of his ears!

111
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,416
- It's because of you!
- Because of me?!

112
00:10:01,417 --> 00:10:05,583
You're distracting him!
Get out! Get out!

113
00:10:05,584 --> 00:10:09,333
Watch it, Pop. I can't say about
you, but I command respect here.

114
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:12,874
Respect indeed!
You steal change from the counter!

115
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:16,249
You beggar!
Pretending to be a hero, eh?

116
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,207
You're angry now, father.
I'll explain it this evening.

117
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:20,708
You mean you will return in the evening?!

118
00:10:20,709 --> 00:10:23,834
No father can possibly have
such a useless son as you are!

119
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,082
Indeed there must be!

120
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:31,958
Like father, like son!

121
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:38,125
My left-eye's twitching a lot today.

122
00:10:38,709 --> 00:10:40,791
That's considered to be a good omen!

123
00:10:40,792 --> 00:10:43,082
You'll receive good news from everywhere.

124
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:45,999
Good news, my foot!

125
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,625
The day I became a father
was the last of my good days!

126
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,207
From that day to the present...

127
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:55,958
...my son Prem has never given
me the opportunity to be happy!

128
00:10:56,292 --> 00:10:59,375
I make the hard-earned
money, and he blows it up!

129
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:01,957
Who are you cribbing about?

130
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:04,374
My son!
But what brings you here?

131
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:07,624
Have you forgotten?
You owe the moneylender Rs.500.

132
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,374
What nonsense!

133
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:12,625
Oh yes!
The money must be paid, right?

134
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:18,749
Here's the money in
5 crisp 100-rupee notes!

135
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,040
Prem has cleaned out my money-box!

136
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:22,499
Why are you making excuses?

137
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,915
That poor chap's sitting at "Wow Wow Studios"

138
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:28,124
- "Wow Wow Studious", eh?
- Yes.

139
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:30,624
The film-bug, Johny, has bitten him real badly!

140
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,583
He's swindling my son!

141
00:11:32,584 --> 00:11:37,875
This Johny had sent my father to
Bombay, promising a career in films!

142
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,374
He still hasn't returned!

143
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:44,207
You find him standing like this in
the crowd scenes in some films.

144
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:47,542
He's conning my son, this Johny!
Where's my stick?

145
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:06,749
Wow!
What a face!

146
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,249
What a mug!

147
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,291
It's the only one of its kind!

148
00:12:11,292 --> 00:12:14,875
- What was that?
- I spat to ward off evil!

149
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,124
Well, teacher,
I'll become a star, won't it?

150
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:22,207
'Become' a star?
You're already a star, pal!

151
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:26,167
Get on with the
Production now!

152
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,583
It's already started.
I've even spoken to Amitabh.

153
00:12:29,584 --> 00:12:32,832
- What about me?
- You'll play the main lead!

154
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:35,790
He'll only play your father.

155
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:38,875
- Will he 'do'?
- Do?! It's more than done!

156
00:12:41,167 --> 00:12:45,584
Amitabh and I... the father and the son...

157
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:48,708
...and the ensuing clash between the two!

158
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:51,790
Wow!
What a scene!

159
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:55,124
Steaming hot... the tea at
"Wow Wow Productions"

160
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:56,708
Here you are, sir!

161
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:58,957
Get him a cold drink.

162
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:02,333
Any news of the call we were
to receive from Subhash Ghai?

163
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:05,832
Oh, that?!
It's due any moment!

164
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:09,040
I had sent your photographs to Subhash Ghai.

165
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:13,082
He needs a new 'mug' like
yours, for a film he's making.

166
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:18,750
It's called
'The Romance of Dracula"

167
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:25,082
Don't forget my role!

168
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:29,708
Yes, 'Subbu'?
It's Subhash Ghai on the line!

169
00:13:30,292 --> 00:13:31,915
Convey my respects, too, Sir!

170
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:35,417
Did you like the photographs?

171
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:39,625
What?! It's created a furors
in the whole of Bombay?!

172
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:43,707
Have people liked it so much?

173
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:46,874
What?!
Oh no...

174
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:50,915
Is that so?

175
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:54,000
He showed your photographs to Madhuri Dixit.

176
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:58,665
What did she say?
She'll work only with him?

177
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:02,665
And with nobody else?!
That's wonderful!

178
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,874
She even kept a snap of his with herself?!

179
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:08,874
Oh no!

180
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:17,083
There are two heroines in the film.
He's spoken to Juhi, too.

181
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:20,790
She has your address.
She'll be here to meet you.

182
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,124
Will both of them 'do'?

183
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:26,583
'Do' did you ask?!
Of course they will!

184
00:14:26,584 --> 00:14:29,707
Hey, get up!
Listen to me...

185
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:32,499
Your work is now accomplished.

186
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,500
But the respect and honor of
"Wow Wow Productions" is ruined!

187
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:40,459
The shopkeeper says that if he
does not get Rs.500/- immediately...

188
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:44,915
...he'll take away your camera from here!

189
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:47,416
I try to give the
Film Industry new faces...

190
00:14:47,417 --> 00:14:50,041
...and they want to take away my camera!

191
00:14:50,042 --> 00:14:53,124
It's only a camera, after all.
Not his good-fortune!

192
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,541
- Give away the camera!
- Wait!

193
00:14:55,542 --> 00:14:58,249
He wants to pay up!
Give it to him...

194
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,374
Throw this money in his face!

195
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:03,333
I'll do the hitting on your face!

196
00:15:03,334 --> 00:15:06,500
You're squandering away
my money on this baldie!

197
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:09,541
- He's making me a star!
- A star, eh?

198
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:11,583
He can't be a peon himself!

199
00:15:11,584 --> 00:15:15,166
I'll make you the hero in my film, too, uncle!

200
00:15:15,167 --> 00:15:20,791
You old sinner!
You've even conned my father!

201
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,082
And you're pretending to be young, eh?

202
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,582
Listen carefully...

203
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:28,250
...if you fool my foolish son any further...

204
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:32,583
...I'll put a needle in one ear
and pull it out of your other!

205
00:15:32,917 --> 00:15:36,166
I'll seal your ears, not to speak of shut mouths!

206
00:15:36,167 --> 00:15:39,459
Call me a fool if you like, but
I'll achieve something in life!

207
00:15:39,917 --> 00:15:42,749
- Hello!
- Hello, yourself!

208
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,916
Stitch-up your lips and hold the
tailors' scissors in your hand!

209
00:15:45,917 --> 00:15:47,916
- I can't do that, father!
- Can't do it?

210
00:15:47,917 --> 00:15:49,749
Would you like a begging-bowl then?

211
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:53,334
No, father...
I can see my goal ahead!

212
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,999
There's the Police Station
and the graveyard ahead!

213
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,832
Which of the two is your goal, son?

214
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,082
How do I explain?

215
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:07,375
The 'star' of my destiny, is about to shine!

216
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:18,582
Is it true that you've come
to India only to get married?

217
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:21,708
Yes.
What's so surprising?

218
00:16:22,167 --> 00:16:24,790
The only daughter of the
filthy-rich Ramgopal Bajaj...

219
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:28,417
...you've been to the whole of the world.

220
00:16:28,917 --> 00:16:31,582
But why did you choose
India to get married?

221
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:33,374
I mean, why the Indian boys.

222
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:36,750
I believe that people here
are in love with love...

223
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:41,250
I mean, they use their hearts, not their brains.

224
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,374
I too am looking for one such crazy chap.

225
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:46,999
You'll find him!
It's a country of crazy people!

226
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,333
You'll find thousands of them!

227
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,082
You haven't said something, have you?

228
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,208
- You've heard nothing, right?
- Oh nothing!

229
00:16:59,209 --> 00:17:02,708
I spoke a little.
Can something go wrong if I speak?

230
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,665
You say something, they
understand another thing...

231
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,749
...they understand little, but write a lot...

232
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,916
...they write here, it's published elsewhere...

233
00:17:09,917 --> 00:17:12,458
...whatever is published, is strange...

234
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:15,041
...and that strange something
could lead to everything strange!

235
00:17:15,042 --> 00:17:17,916
Yes...
It'll lead to something.

236
00:17:17,917 --> 00:17:20,749
Who are you, 'Miss Something'?

237
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:25,625
This is Karisma.
She's my...

238
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,957
One last question.
If you come across two boys...

239
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:34,791
...one intelligent and the other
large-hearted, whom will you choose?

240
00:17:34,792 --> 00:17:37,874
They will both be rejected.

241
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:41,000
Because she likes boys a bit large-hearted.

242
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:45,958
And intelligent, too.

243
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:49,791
Isn't Mr. Rustom there?

244
00:17:49,792 --> 00:17:52,582
Why does she sell stale eatables?

245
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:53,957
How are you, Amar?

246
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,333
Hasn't the strike been called off, Mr. Ahmed?

247
00:17:56,334 --> 00:17:59,082
- No, it's still continuing.
- I can't understand Govt. Policies.

248
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:02,082
For all that the leaders do, we pay for it, right?

249
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:08,500
Looks like I'll have to do something.

250
00:18:11,792 --> 00:18:14,540
The bum's arrived at last!

251
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:19,083
Are you newly employed?
Switch on the fan.

252
00:18:19,084 --> 00:18:20,749
The old thing can fall on your head at any time.

253
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,041
The Beauty from London now in India.

254
00:18:23,042 --> 00:18:24,749
In search of an eligible bachelor.

255
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,333
What a babe!
She looks like a film-star!

256
00:18:27,334 --> 00:18:30,916
She's come here to get married.
Go on and read...

257
00:18:30,917 --> 00:18:34,334
The person whom she marries
will inherit Rs.50 crores!

258
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:38,666
- Besides two factories in London.
- A diamond-business in Switzerland!

259
00:18:39,334 --> 00:18:41,083
There's a farmhouse, too!

260
00:18:41,084 --> 00:18:44,499
She's not a girl, she's a jackpot!

261
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,249
That's enough!
This news is for me!

262
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,374
- For you?!
- Of course!

263
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:52,208
- She's my heroine!
- Am I dead, then?!

264
00:18:52,209 --> 00:18:54,540
She's here in India, only for me!

265
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,582
Bravo, my boy!

266
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:59,666
Manage to trap her just once...

267
00:19:00,084 --> 00:19:03,917
...like I've trapped you... I mean,
like I've made you the hero...

268
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:08,499
...and bring her here.

269
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:13,750
Our "Wow Wow Productions" will then
become an international company.

270
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,582
After which, we'll make films only in English.

271
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:23,750
We'll need lots of money for this!

272
00:19:24,042 --> 00:19:27,582
Money can be arranged.

273
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:31,541
Sell your father's shop and his house.

274
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:36,500
Give me half the money, and
vanish with the other half.

275
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:41,042
I'll sit here and finalize the
story, set-up and music.

276
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:45,875
Only bring the girl, and become a star.

277
00:19:51,667 --> 00:19:54,124
You ungrateful wretch!

278
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:56,457
You compete with me, before my very shop!

279
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:59,083
It's not my own business, sir, it's yours!

280
00:19:59,084 --> 00:20:02,083
Amar drove everybody out of the shop, sir.

281
00:20:02,084 --> 00:20:05,292
I wonder what's happened to Amar.
He's mumbling to himself!

282
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,749
Mumbling to himself?!

283
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,124
You?!
Hats off to you!

284
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:16,084
I always knew you had it...
But so much!

285
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:21,540
Amar salutes you!

286
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:25,041
- What's going on?
- I asked you stand outside.

287
00:20:25,042 --> 00:20:27,749
- You donkey!
- Father?! It's you!

288
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,958
I was awaiting you.

289
00:20:29,959 --> 00:20:35,625
You're great! You're exemplary!
There's no father like you!

290
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:38,832
You're worth worshipping.
You're supreme!

291
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:42,208
In fact, I've realized that you're not even man...

292
00:20:42,209 --> 00:20:45,540
You're a great-soul!

293
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:49,333
Great! Simply superb!
You're the Knowledgeable One!

294
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,832
At last you've heard my prayers, O Lord!

295
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,332
He did that 26 years ago!

296
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,791
Where are your feet?
I want to fall at them!

297
00:20:57,792 --> 00:21:00,249
Oh forget it, son.
But tell me...

298
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,374
...what did you suddenly discover in me?

299
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,582
You don't know your own virtues, father!

300
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:11,041
You're so great, because you
happen to be Amar's father!

301
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:15,792
I recognize you now.
Everybody will, too, in the future.

302
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:19,999
They'll say, "there goes Amar's father"

303
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,791
The cops will say that, too!

304
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,582
"There goes Amar's father"

305
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:26,124
Whenever I'm happy, you
seem to be sad, father!

306
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:29,250
What else can I do?

307
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,833
As and when you've been happy,
I've been ruined.

308
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:39,542
Do you remember, when I
first bought you a bicycle?

309
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,415
You were very happy.

310
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:46,166
But you crashed into my father's legs.

311
00:21:46,167 --> 00:21:49,500
And till the time he died, he
was known as the lame-duck.

312
00:21:50,084 --> 00:21:53,374
The next time you were happy was when...

313
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:56,999
...I bought you a firework
called Ram Bharose Rocket...

314
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,959
...you fired it, and burnt down Gupta's shop.

315
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:06,125
I'm still paying for the damages.

316
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:09,749
The third time you were happy was when...

317
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:13,207
...you pulled the string from your aunt's slip...

318
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:14,999
Forget the past!

319
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,083
I'm about to do something for which I was born!

320
00:22:19,084 --> 00:22:20,916
And what is that?

321
00:22:20,917 --> 00:22:23,374
Stop worrying and imagine...

322
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:28,166
...a cigar worth Rs.50 in your hand
instead of a 50 paise 'beedi'!

323
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:31,707
And a hat instead of this cap!

324
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:34,834
A suit and imported shoes!

325
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:42,582
- How does it feel, dad?
- Great!

326
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:46,708
But how will all this be possible?

327
00:22:47,917 --> 00:22:51,792
- I'm going to marry a rich girl!
- Is it?

328
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,833
We'll be rich after that!

329
00:22:54,834 --> 00:22:58,916
I'll open many such shops for you.

330
00:22:58,917 --> 00:23:01,959
Then why don't you get married quickly?

331
00:23:02,667 --> 00:23:06,042
You'll have to sell off your
third-rate saloon for that...

332
00:23:06,917 --> 00:23:08,958
...and give me Rs.25,000!

333
00:23:08,959 --> 00:23:13,792
Rs. 25,000/-?!
You won't get a penny!

334
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:17,249
Get out!
Out you go!

335
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,541
Here's the money.
Return the 25 paise.

336
00:23:19,542 --> 00:23:21,791
The big noise you make for 25 paise!

337
00:23:21,792 --> 00:23:25,042
That's how I've built this house of mine!

338
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:29,875
Hi! How was your pilgrimage?
Could you see the deity?

339
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,749
There was a big crowd...

340
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:35,165
...but somehow I managed to get in.

341
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:38,207
What's the noise for? Has the
money lender's house been sold?

342
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,124
Not the moneylender's; your house's sold.

343
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:43,208
My house is sold?!
Hold this!

344
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:45,916
...who sold it?!

345
00:23:45,917 --> 00:23:48,207
But why are you dragging me?

346
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:50,582
- Keep the stuff down!
- Father!

347
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:53,041
He even screams!

348
00:23:53,042 --> 00:23:55,999
F-A-T-H-E-R!

349
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,332
- What's it, son?
- Who's this?

350
00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:00,541
- He's Liyaqat.
- Liyaqat who?

351
00:24:00,542 --> 00:24:03,249
He owns a butcher's shop at Chimney Street.

352
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:07,542
You mean he'll slaughter animals
instead of using the scissors!

353
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,958
- Who are you?
- Who am I?

354
00:24:09,959 --> 00:24:14,208
I own this house.
I went out and you occupied it!

355
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:16,374
So what if you did!

356
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:19,708
So, it's you, eh?
Greetings!

357
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:21,541
When were you discharged from the hospital?

358
00:24:21,542 --> 00:24:24,583
Your son said you were being
treated for a mental disorder.

359
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:26,791
Mental disorder?
What's all this?

360
00:24:26,792 --> 00:24:29,082
You have a good son.

361
00:24:29,083 --> 00:24:31,874
He said he needed money
for his father's treatment.

362
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:35,582
I gave him Rs. 22,000 for this house.

363
00:24:35,583 --> 00:24:37,833
He took the money!
This is my ancestral property, Sir!

364
00:24:37,834 --> 00:24:40,374
It used to be.
It no longer is.

365
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:45,666
I'll deal with you, Prem!

366
00:24:45,959 --> 00:24:49,124
Bravo, Babulal, my loyal friend...

367
00:24:49,125 --> 00:24:51,999
...you're continuing my business even outside!

368
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,249
Not your business anymore, sir.
It's my own, this time.

369
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:58,709
Your business is closed.
Your shop has been sold!

370
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:03,041
Amar sold it to Shankar when
you went away for 2 days.

371
00:25:03,917 --> 00:25:07,125
Your son has sold this shop to me.

372
00:25:07,667 --> 00:25:10,791
I'll sell bangles in this shop now!

373
00:25:10,792 --> 00:25:15,666
He left a note for you.

374
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:21,249
Wealth worth Rs.50 crores.

375
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:24,749
The only heir.

376
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:27,416
I had seen her when she was small.

377
00:25:27,417 --> 00:25:31,041
The poor thing will see
very few days of her youth.

378
00:25:32,792 --> 00:25:35,582
She's coming to India to get married...

379
00:25:35,583 --> 00:25:39,374
It's funny how death drags
a person all over the world.

380
00:25:39,375 --> 00:25:43,833
It's good... it'll be an interesting game to play.

381
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:48,041
Ask Bhalla to take D'Souza's
place at Shanti Villa.

382
00:25:48,375 --> 00:25:50,124
Yes, sir.

383
00:25:50,125 --> 00:25:53,375
But Mr. Bhalla has a fantastic idea, sir...

384
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:57,917
...why don't we throw D'Souza
from a cliff at Junagadh...

385
00:25:58,583 --> 00:26:04,250
Keep Bhalla's ideas to yourself.

386
00:26:06,583 --> 00:26:10,875
How each card of this game has to be dealt...

387
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:14,249
...is something
I know very well.

388
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:19,082
This is the biggest game of my life.

389
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:22,166
I'll make each and every move very carefully.

390
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:26,624
None of them is any good, Robert!

391
00:26:26,625 --> 00:26:29,165
They all have some defect or the other.

392
00:26:29,166 --> 00:26:33,333
Coming to India was a waste of time!

393
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:36,249
I'm very angry with my manager, D'Souza!

394
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:39,291
How dare he present such pictures to me!

395
00:26:39,292 --> 00:26:42,833
- Where is he, by the way?
- He's no more, Madam.

396
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:44,999
Who are you?
Who's he, Robert?

397
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,082
He's our new manager.

398
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:52,542
The name's Vinod... but everybody
in town calls me Bhalla.

399
00:26:53,208 --> 00:26:57,000
- But where's D'Souza?
- Yes?

400
00:26:57,542 --> 00:26:59,457
He's 'off', Madam.

401
00:26:59,458 --> 00:27:03,041
He means D'Souza is on a long-holiday.

402
00:27:03,709 --> 00:27:06,957
Now I will make all the arrangements here.

403
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:10,458
I can't figure out anything.
Okay, you may leave now.

404
00:27:11,292 --> 00:27:15,417
Madam wants to rest, and we've got work to do.

405
00:27:22,125 --> 00:27:26,750
Oh Mother!

406
00:27:32,333 --> 00:27:34,165
It was the same again.

407
00:27:34,166 --> 00:27:36,124
Okay, please go ahead.

408
00:27:36,125 --> 00:27:38,082
- You go ahead.
- No, you go on.

409
00:27:38,083 --> 00:27:40,999
- Go ahead.
- Please do.

410
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,999
A couple of aristocratic gentlemen
lost their train in this manner.

411
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,583
Mr. Raj Kapoor has dealt
with this in detail in 'Bobby'.

412
00:27:46,584 --> 00:27:49,625
So, before the bus departs,
let me get in. You can follow me.

413
00:27:50,167 --> 00:27:55,167
Oh sure! Please do!
Come on...

414
00:27:56,083 --> 00:27:59,416
- What do you do?
- Nothing.

415
00:27:59,417 --> 00:28:02,750
I mean, I don't have to work at all.

416
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:06,749
My father has made a pile.
He's got a flourishing business.

417
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:09,040
What business?

418
00:28:09,041 --> 00:28:12,417
We're into garments.
We export garments...

419
00:28:13,208 --> 00:28:16,583
Nothing is sold here... everything is exported!

420
00:28:16,584 --> 00:28:20,125
You must have heard the name...
Chaudhary and Sons!

421
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:24,584
Oh yes!
Chaudhary and Sons!

422
00:28:24,916 --> 00:28:27,541
- I've heard the name.
- You have?

423
00:28:27,542 --> 00:28:31,332
The raw material you use, is from our company.

424
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:34,584
The Mehta Group... it's a very big company.

425
00:28:35,584 --> 00:28:37,957
We give a lot of people goods on credit...

426
00:28:37,958 --> 00:28:42,208
I think Chaudhary and
Sons owes us money, too.

427
00:28:42,625 --> 00:28:45,207
That's okay.
I'll check the accounts!

428
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:48,082
"Mehta Textiles!"

429
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:51,958
"When there's no Chaudhary & Sons
how can there be Mehta Textiles?"

430
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:55,999
"Chaudhary & Sons, eh?"

431
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,082
"He looks like a worker in
an Indian-smokes factory!"

432
00:28:59,083 --> 00:29:01,874
"The bloody rotten mango!"

433
00:29:01,875 --> 00:29:04,082
Where did you buy that cap from?
From France?

434
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:06,374
Oh no, it's from Switzerland.

435
00:29:06,375 --> 00:29:09,874
I go there very often.
I like the Sunset there.

436
00:29:09,875 --> 00:29:13,000
The cap's very nice, too.
It looks good on you.

437
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:17,207
"He looks like an ape with
a watermelon on his head!"

438
00:29:17,208 --> 00:29:21,958
Where did you get this jacket from?
Is it a Chaudhary & Sons product?

439
00:29:22,417 --> 00:29:24,249
- Oh no.
- It must be from America then.

440
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:26,708
Oh no,
I got it from New York.

441
00:29:26,709 --> 00:29:29,875
Oh?!
I thought it was American.

442
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:34,417
"He's as big a liar as I am"

443
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:38,790
"He looks like a monkey
retired from the circus!"

444
00:29:38,791 --> 00:29:41,541
- Where are you both going?
- To Ooty.

445
00:29:41,542 --> 00:29:44,416
- I'm going to Ooty, too.
- Is it? You too?

446
00:29:44,417 --> 00:29:50,209
- We seem to have the same goal.
- We'll have a nice trip.

447
00:30:37,167 --> 00:33:08,375
EROS

448
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:53,041
Hey! What are two cups for?
Take away one of them!

449
00:33:53,042 --> 00:33:56,167
- I'll also have tea.
- We'll share the tea, pal!

450
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,249
- It strengthens friendship.
- Does it?

451
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:00,291
Go on and drink.

452
00:34:00,292 --> 00:34:06,250
We're not sharing tea, my friend.
We're sharing love.

453
00:34:07,583 --> 00:34:11,208
What are you doing? I'll pay!
Take the money back!

454
00:34:11,209 --> 00:34:13,749
- But why?
- It's not fair. Take it back!

455
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:17,041
- It doesn't matter.
- It does. Take it back!

456
00:34:17,042 --> 00:34:18,707
- That's no friendship...
- Okay.

457
00:34:18,708 --> 00:34:21,208
- I'll take it...
- Pay for it, if you insist.

458
00:34:21,209 --> 00:34:27,375
But I'll pay the next time.
You can't always pay it!

459
00:34:28,083 --> 00:34:31,250
Hey Danny boy!
Take this.

460
00:34:34,375 --> 00:34:37,625
Our friendship will set an
example in the days to come.

461
00:34:38,917 --> 00:34:43,292
Amar! Look at that... your future sister-in-law!

462
00:34:48,917 --> 00:34:51,874
Are you getting married to Madhuri Dixit?

463
00:34:51,875 --> 00:34:57,417
No, not that picture.
The one below that.

464
00:35:01,042 --> 00:35:04,665
She's not my sister-in-law,
but yours, understand?

465
00:35:04,666 --> 00:35:07,124
- Amar, our friendship...
- To hell with it!

466
00:35:07,125 --> 00:35:09,124
I'll get married to her!

467
00:35:09,125 --> 00:35:12,416
- You're doing a somersault!
- So what?

468
00:35:13,084 --> 00:35:15,999
I could tell from the look of you!
Marry Raveena, my foot!

469
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,665
Do you know how you look
in that two-penny cap?

470
00:35:18,666 --> 00:35:20,832
It looks like a watermelon on an ape's head!

471
00:35:20,833 --> 00:35:26,000
Insult?! And you?! This jacket
from the street-shops...

472
00:35:26,334 --> 00:35:29,999
...makes you look like a
retired monkey from a circus!

473
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,415
- Bloody monkey!
- Rotten-mango! I won't spare you!

474
00:35:33,416 --> 00:35:36,958
I won't spare you!

475
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,291
Careful!

476
00:35:47,292 --> 00:35:52,334
Rascals! Getting into fights?!
I'll lock you up!

477
00:35:52,792 --> 00:35:56,042
- Come on!
- We won't fight, Sir!

478
00:35:57,625 --> 00:36:00,832
Our bags are in the bus, sir!

479
00:36:00,833 --> 00:36:06,625
Peace! Peace!

480
00:36:10,583 --> 00:36:14,415
That's a good combination!

481
00:36:14,416 --> 00:36:16,582
This looks like a new
Police Station, sir.

482
00:36:16,583 --> 00:36:17,999
It's brand new!

483
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,083
- Sir, they...
- Quiet. We're talking.

484
00:36:20,084 --> 00:36:23,291
- You remain quiet.
- It's new. Built in 2 months.

485
00:36:23,292 --> 00:36:26,415
- Sir, they both...
- I know they’re Amar and Prem.

486
00:36:26,416 --> 00:36:28,999
You mustn't interfere when
there are big people talking.

487
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,083
- Quiet!
- But they were...

488
00:36:31,084 --> 00:36:34,791
Everything here is new; including the furniture!

489
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:38,208
I'm only waiting for someone to cut the 'ribbon'.

490
00:36:38,209 --> 00:36:41,291
The lock-up will have to
be inaugurated, you see!

491
00:36:41,292 --> 00:36:44,458
For that, I need a thief, a rascal, a loafer...

492
00:36:44,792 --> 00:36:49,375
...he'll inaugurate the
lock-up and I'll enjoy myself!

493
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,999
We'll take your leave now, sir.

494
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,083
It's been a pleasure meeting you.

495
00:36:56,084 --> 00:37:00,167
I'd brought them here for the inauguration, sir!

496
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:03,832
They're both ruffians.

497
00:37:03,833 --> 00:37:06,791
They were fighting it out on the streets!

498
00:37:06,792 --> 00:37:09,499
- It wasn't me. It was him!
- Yes, sir...

499
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:12,249
- No, sir! It was him.
- He started it, sir.

500
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:14,791
- He hit me first, sir.
- But who kicked first?

501
00:37:14,792 --> 00:37:17,332
- Why did you abuse me?
- Didn't you abuse me, too?

502
00:37:17,333 --> 00:37:19,958
But I didn't abuse him, sir!

503
00:37:19,959 --> 00:37:23,249
- I'll lock both of you!
- Look at my face, sir...

504
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,582
...do I look capable of fighting?

505
00:37:25,583 --> 00:37:27,749
I'm a follower of non-violence, sir.

506
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,999
He's a liar, sir.
He's being 'misled' by your looks!

507
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,791
- He thinks you're a fool!
- Fool?!

508
00:37:31,792 --> 00:37:34,791
He called you a fool!
He abused you!

509
00:37:34,792 --> 00:37:38,166
I too could have called you
a donkey? But did I? No!

510
00:37:38,167 --> 00:37:42,499
Because I know that your
appearance is deceptive.

511
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:47,374
The two of you are calling me
names in 'my' Police Station!

512
00:37:47,375 --> 00:37:50,416
Where is it...
I'll shoot you both!

513
00:37:50,667 --> 00:37:53,499
He abused you. Lock him up!
Let me go!

514
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:57,000
The Inspector's busy... to
hell with the Commissioner!

515
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:00,791
It was the Commissioner's phone!

516
00:38:00,792 --> 00:38:02,624
He's put you to trouble, sir!

517
00:38:02,625 --> 00:38:05,249
Look at his audacity!
He wants me locked up!

518
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:08,708
I know you're great and have
recognized him at the first glance!

519
00:38:09,583 --> 00:38:12,290
He's flattering you, sir!

520
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:15,249
- He's cut the ribbon, sir!
- There's less of sugar.

521
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:18,041
- Get some sugar!
- He had your tea, sir!

522
00:38:18,042 --> 00:38:19,791
My tea!

523
00:38:19,792 --> 00:38:21,582
Throw him in the cell, sir!

524
00:38:21,583 --> 00:38:23,916
He drank my tea; called me names!

525
00:38:23,917 --> 00:38:25,791
I'm fed up with both of you!

526
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:27,624
- Can we go, sir?
- N-O!

527
00:38:27,625 --> 00:38:29,457
I'll deal with both of you separately.

528
00:38:29,458 --> 00:38:31,166
With me first, sir.
I'm in a hurry.

529
00:38:31,167 --> 00:38:35,124
I'm not in a hurry, sir!

530
00:38:35,125 --> 00:38:38,582
Go away... go and sit there.
Go!

531
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:41,624
- Sit down.
- He waves his gun for nothing!

532
00:38:41,625 --> 00:38:45,332
I had picked Prem's pocket.

533
00:38:45,333 --> 00:38:48,874
Let me see how much 'bread'
the bloody millionaire has!

534
00:38:48,875 --> 00:38:51,332
The bloody ape!

535
00:38:51,333 --> 00:38:55,083
Is there nothing?

536
00:38:55,084 --> 00:38:59,916
"Shame on you, thief?!"

537
00:39:02,625 --> 00:39:04,749
Okay...
Go and sit there.

538
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:08,124
- But, sir...
- Sit down there!

539
00:39:08,125 --> 00:39:11,500
- Come here.
- Who? I?

540
00:39:12,042 --> 00:39:16,584
Come here!

541
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:23,332
Oh Mother!

542
00:39:23,333 --> 00:39:26,375
- Listen to me!
- But... sir...

543
00:39:26,875 --> 00:39:30,208
I'll show you something instead.
Come with me...

544
00:39:30,708 --> 00:39:32,874
Come with me and
look at this...

545
00:39:32,875 --> 00:39:35,249
...I've brought the thief you were looking for!

546
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:37,833
Don't let his innocent face deceive you!

547
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:41,499
He is, in fact, a dangerous criminal!

548
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:44,374
Now lock him up, after
charging him appropriately.

549
00:39:44,375 --> 00:39:47,457
Wait a minute...

550
00:39:47,458 --> 00:39:49,290
What are you looking at me and the snap for?

551
00:39:49,291 --> 00:39:51,916
Look at him and then at the snap!

552
00:39:51,917 --> 00:39:56,000
- That's not me, Sir!
- Shall we go?

553
00:39:56,583 --> 00:39:59,290
He's a twin-brother!

554
00:39:59,291 --> 00:40:04,708
"My father always said I'd
make a big name for myself"

555
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:08,457
Give him a big hand!

556
00:40:08,458 --> 00:40:13,291
"Our darling son will
accomplish something so big..."

557
00:40:14,875 --> 00:40:16,666
Here's your wallet.

558
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:19,916
Would I leave your wallet,
when you had picked mine?

559
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:23,208
It has 5 bucks.
You'll need the dough. Bye!

560
00:40:26,208 --> 00:40:28,916
There's no vacant room in this lodge.

561
00:40:28,917 --> 00:40:30,791
- Give me a cot then.
- There's no cot, too!

562
00:40:30,792 --> 00:40:32,958
I'll manage under the cot, too.

563
00:40:32,959 --> 00:40:35,290
- Now listen...
- Look. God's looking at you!

564
00:40:35,291 --> 00:40:38,499
Like you, I'm
His devotee too!

565
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:41,290
I'll die, if I don't find place to sleep today.

566
00:40:41,291 --> 00:40:44,124
Suppose I die, my blind sister...

567
00:40:44,125 --> 00:40:47,666
...and my poor mother, who's a widow...

568
00:40:47,667 --> 00:40:53,625
My blind sister and my mother who's a widow...

569
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:57,249
God! I was about to commit a grave sin!

570
00:40:57,250 --> 00:41:00,457
- Listen, I have a room upstairs.
- It'll do.

571
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:03,207
- There's a lot of stuff there...
- It will do.

572
00:41:03,208 --> 00:41:06,207
- Let's go.
- You're not a man...

573
00:41:06,208 --> 00:41:08,833
- What?!
- You're a Great Soul!

574
00:41:08,834 --> 00:41:11,290
Don't talk...
Just listen.

575
00:41:11,291 --> 00:41:14,583
Where have you brought me, Mr. Sewaram?

576
00:41:14,917 --> 00:41:17,207
Don't talk. Only listen.

577
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:19,332
- You don't snore, do you?
- Oh no.

578
00:41:19,333 --> 00:41:23,916
There's a graveyard nearby;
the dead shouldn't complain.

579
00:41:23,917 --> 00:41:26,582
Have a bath between 1 and 2 in
the morning when there's water.

580
00:41:26,583 --> 00:41:30,040
- Between 1 and 2 in the morning...
- Don't talk. Listen...

581
00:41:30,041 --> 00:41:33,541
Don't mess with the ceiling-fan.
It can fall anytime.

582
00:41:33,542 --> 00:41:36,875
And don't switch on the
lights after Sunset.

583
00:41:37,291 --> 00:41:39,624
But it's only after Sunset...

584
00:41:39,625 --> 00:41:42,749
What I mean is how will I change?

585
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,749
Why do you need lights
to change your clothes?

586
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:46,541
Take them off and go to sleep!

587
00:41:46,542 --> 00:41:48,708
- Do you plan to show something?
- Oh no!

588
00:41:48,709 --> 00:41:52,249
The fatso doesn't even allow
the lights to be switched on!

589
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:53,749
That's okay, sonny-boy...

590
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:57,582
...once you get Raveena,
there'll be lights all around.

591
00:41:57,583 --> 00:41:59,499
Lights all around.

592
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:04,750
I'm exhausted...

593
00:42:06,291 --> 00:42:11,666
This is the bed...
let's sleep now.

594
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:19,332
Your Amar has arrived, Raveena.

595
00:42:19,333 --> 00:42:22,165
Prem really put me into trouble.

596
00:42:22,166 --> 00:42:25,457
But it was your love which saved me.

597
00:42:25,458 --> 00:42:28,875
There must be many donkeys
dreaming about you, Raveena.

598
00:42:29,375 --> 00:42:32,834
But when you meet Prem (Love)...

599
00:42:33,333 --> 00:42:37,542
...you'll fall head over heels in love with him!

600
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,957
My love!

601
00:42:39,958 --> 00:42:43,750
- What are you doing here?
- And what are you doing here?

602
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,458
I think the idiot's dead.
His spirit is roaming...

603
00:42:48,834 --> 00:42:50,541
It must be your spirit.

604
00:42:50,542 --> 00:42:52,916
- Get lost!
- You get lost!

605
00:42:52,917 --> 00:42:56,709
- Go... get lost... damn you...
- Go... get lost... Oh mother!

606
00:42:57,750 --> 00:43:00,541
Hey, Amar...
How are you?

607
00:43:00,542 --> 00:43:03,541
- 'First Class'. How are you?
- 'Tip Top'!

608
00:43:03,542 --> 00:43:06,625
- Y-O-U?!
- Y-O-U?!

609
00:43:06,916 --> 00:43:08,374
- What are you doing here?
- How about you?

610
00:43:08,375 --> 00:43:10,249
- I came here first!
- By conning me!

611
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:13,040
- You picked my pocket first!
- You did!

612
00:43:13,041 --> 00:43:14,499
What did you say?!

613
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:19,417
What's going on?
Fighting and arson in my lodge?!

614
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:23,041
Not fighting!
This is affection!

615
00:43:23,709 --> 00:43:29,000
We were separated in our childhood.
Which explains the affection!

616
00:43:29,333 --> 00:43:34,166
Lots of love!
Why did you get separated?

617
00:43:34,584 --> 00:43:38,250
It wasn't me... we were separated
in the fair held at Kumbh!

618
00:43:39,292 --> 00:43:42,624
It was because he left my hand.
Why did you do that?

619
00:43:42,625 --> 00:43:46,792
Come and embrace me, brother...

620
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,624
Never leave me now!

621
00:43:51,625 --> 00:43:57,167
You've become very fat!
Naughty boy!

622
00:44:07,916 --> 00:44:11,165
Make up for the lost years.
Your love and affection...

623
00:44:11,166 --> 00:44:14,082
...reminds me of that episode of
Raman and Sagar's "Ramayan"...

624
00:44:14,083 --> 00:44:17,625
...in which Lord Rama and Bharat were united.

625
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,791
Not two... take away one cup of tea...

626
00:44:42,792 --> 00:44:45,124
...we'll share the tea.
It'll strengthen our friendship.

627
00:44:45,125 --> 00:44:46,749
Keep it there!

628
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:49,832
What friendship?
To hell with it!

629
00:44:49,833 --> 00:44:51,791
I'm telling you
Raveena's not for you.

630
00:44:51,792 --> 00:44:53,416
You don't understand and instead get angry!

631
00:44:53,417 --> 00:44:55,624
Be a good boy and return to Bhopal.

632
00:44:55,625 --> 00:44:57,583
You're threatening me!

633
00:44:57,584 --> 00:45:00,332
Do you see these muscles?
I'll crush you!

634
00:45:00,333 --> 00:45:03,624
Flexing muscles, idiot?!
Raveena's mine! Hear that!

635
00:45:03,625 --> 00:45:05,207
Yes.
She's your sister-in-law.

636
00:45:05,208 --> 00:45:07,124
What are you fighting for?

637
00:45:07,125 --> 00:45:10,166
The deserving person from the trio will get her.

638
00:45:10,167 --> 00:45:13,082
- Who's the third?
- Who's the third, punk?

639
00:45:13,083 --> 00:45:15,249
- I'm there, too.
- You?!

640
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:17,957
How dare you?!
How could you even imagine!

641
00:45:17,958 --> 00:45:19,374
Just as you did!

642
00:45:19,375 --> 00:45:21,666
That's enough.
I've got a nasty temper!

643
00:45:21,667 --> 00:45:25,082
- And then? What will you do?
- I... I'll think...

644
00:45:25,083 --> 00:45:27,040
There's no time to waste.

645
00:45:27,041 --> 00:45:30,958
Do you think we're the only aspirants here?

646
00:45:31,333 --> 00:45:34,624
Go there and take a look...
there are thousands there!

647
00:45:34,625 --> 00:45:38,250
There's a big queue. Tokens are
being distributed for the interview.

648
00:45:38,791 --> 00:45:40,915
I had to wait for 20 hours to even get a token!

649
00:45:40,916 --> 00:45:44,833
Oh Mother! No. 717...
Raveena's in great demand!

650
00:45:45,333 --> 00:45:47,708
It's disgusting...

651
00:45:47,709 --> 00:45:50,790
...there's a limit to unemployment.
Youngsters ought to be ashamed!

652
00:45:50,791 --> 00:45:54,166
One rich girl and everybody's
make a beeline for her!

653
00:45:54,167 --> 00:45:56,166
Even though they lack in looks and talent!

654
00:45:56,167 --> 00:45:58,832
You're one of us, too!

655
00:45:58,833 --> 00:46:00,499
My case is different.

656
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:03,749
We'll have to do something to begin with.

657
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:07,500
We'll have to ruin the chances of all
those who have assembled here.

658
00:46:08,041 --> 00:46:10,541
After that, the deserving person will get her.

659
00:46:10,542 --> 00:46:14,124
The deserving will surely get her!

660
00:46:14,125 --> 00:46:16,207
Okay.
Let's go.

661
00:46:16,208 --> 00:46:19,374
Let's go...
I already have her.

662
00:46:19,375 --> 00:46:22,667
You illiterate, ill-mannered, insolent donkey!

663
00:46:23,584 --> 00:46:25,082
You dare ask us for our identity!

664
00:46:25,083 --> 00:46:29,916
Introduce us, Mr. Dhamru!

665
00:46:30,208 --> 00:46:33,333
This is the Nawab Noorali Nizamuddin
Barkatali, alias Bade Miyan.

666
00:46:33,584 --> 00:46:37,584
And this is Ameerali, Ashleelali,
Asli, alias Chhote Miyan.

667
00:46:38,125 --> 00:46:41,790
And I am Damru Tehmurlang Turk.

668
00:46:41,791 --> 00:46:44,666
So many names?
Where are the rest of them?

669
00:46:44,667 --> 00:46:46,790
They're their names.

670
00:46:46,791 --> 00:46:50,625
- Who are you?
- I'm her Sr. Executive Manager.

671
00:46:51,083 --> 00:46:53,416
- And I'm the Junior.
- They appear to be servants.

672
00:46:53,417 --> 00:46:55,207
Their faces say it all.

673
00:46:55,208 --> 00:47:02,500
- We can't see our little girl.
- I'm looking for her, too.

674
00:47:03,042 --> 00:47:05,374
Who's the 'little one'?
Raveena Bajaj has a function here.

675
00:47:05,375 --> 00:47:08,624
She's the 'little one'.
She used to play in my lap!

676
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:10,665
And I used to carry her on my shoulder!

677
00:47:10,666 --> 00:47:14,334
- She used to call me 'Uncle'...
- And I was younger uncle...

678
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:16,749
Oh, so you're her uncle!

679
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:18,874
You've come at the right time.
Today she...

680
00:47:18,875 --> 00:47:22,124
...she will choose her bridegroom.

681
00:47:22,125 --> 00:47:25,041
- Bridegroom?
- There are many suitors here...

682
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:27,957
Because of which we
arranged the function here.

683
00:47:27,958 --> 00:47:30,583
- Idiot! Where are the suitors?
- Over there!

684
00:47:30,584 --> 00:47:33,416
Take me there...
Shame on them!

685
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:35,333
Look, there they are!

686
00:47:35,334 --> 00:47:39,666
Hey young men!
Come here and listen to me!

687
00:47:41,417 --> 00:47:44,416
Just forget the idea of
getting married to Raveena!

688
00:47:44,417 --> 00:47:46,749
Because she was engaged
when she was a child!

689
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:48,082
To Prem Singh, that is!

690
00:47:48,083 --> 00:47:51,916
- Go away all of you. Get lost!
- No!

691
00:47:52,417 --> 00:47:55,124
We will not leave!
We will not go!

692
00:47:55,125 --> 00:47:58,417
- Deal with them, Dhumro!
- As you wish, Sir!

693
00:48:03,542 --> 00:48:08,124
Go and bring Raveena here!
Come on! Hurry up!

694
00:48:08,125 --> 00:48:11,665
- Congratulations.
- To you, too.

695
00:48:11,666 --> 00:48:13,333
There are two elderly gentlemen outside.

696
00:48:13,334 --> 00:48:17,875
They claim that they've had
your father playing in their laps!

697
00:48:18,584 --> 00:48:21,583
They also claim that you
used to call them 'Uncle'.

698
00:48:21,584 --> 00:48:25,584
- Uncle?
- Recognize me? I'm your Uncle!

699
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:29,791
You're scaring the girl!
Come to me, dear...

700
00:48:30,167 --> 00:48:33,041
...do you remember, dear?
We used to go for those walks?

701
00:48:33,042 --> 00:48:35,665
Remember that sweet-meats shop?
Those sweets?

702
00:48:35,666 --> 00:48:39,375
And also the zoo with all those animals...

703
00:48:41,208 --> 00:48:42,999
Step aside!

704
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,125
Come and embrace your uncle!
Come dear, come to me!

705
00:48:46,917 --> 00:48:49,749
She's embraced you enough
when she was a kid.

706
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:51,790
But I was her favorite!

707
00:48:51,791 --> 00:48:54,833
My sweet, honey, darling!

708
00:48:55,958 --> 00:48:59,917
He seems to be hungry!
Give him something to eat!

709
00:49:00,583 --> 00:49:02,249
Oh no! I'm not hungry!

710
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:07,125
What are you looking back for, all the time?

711
00:49:07,459 --> 00:49:10,082
The old man suffers fits of epilepsy!

712
00:49:10,083 --> 00:49:12,249
And clings to anyone who comes before him!

713
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:17,083
Is that so? You have those sweets.
I'll go take a look.

714
00:49:17,417 --> 00:49:20,790
Sweet-meats?!
They're nice indeed!

715
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:24,541
You're more beautiful than
any of your photographs!

716
00:49:24,917 --> 00:49:28,208
Which is why I've fixed your
marriage with Amar Singh.

717
00:49:28,209 --> 00:49:30,832
- Who's Amar Singh?
- Don't you know Amar Singh?!

718
00:49:30,833 --> 00:49:33,749
- No.
- Amar Singh is the handsome youth...

719
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:37,167
...who makes girl swoon when
he walks through their streets!

720
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:41,083
- They really do.
- How can I believe you?

721
00:49:41,459 --> 00:49:45,209
You ill-mannered wretch!
You doubt my words!

722
00:49:45,708 --> 00:49:49,917
People still don't get married in
Aligarh without consulting me!

723
00:49:50,459 --> 00:49:53,749
Not a single marriage!
That's my experience!

724
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:59,291
My hair hasn't turned gray out
of inexperience, you know!

725
00:50:03,292 --> 00:50:06,458
There are many tales revolving
around me and my brother.

726
00:50:06,459 --> 00:50:10,209
We've done everything since
the Independence of India.

727
00:50:12,042 --> 00:50:14,458
So, you know Raveena
since she was a child, right?

728
00:50:14,459 --> 00:50:18,541
Not only our darling Raveena,
I know her father too!

729
00:50:18,875 --> 00:50:20,749
What else do you know?

730
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:24,500
When Raveena sat in my
lap, she just wouldn't get up!

731
00:50:24,958 --> 00:50:29,125
She used to pester me for things
to eat and to roam around the city!

732
00:50:29,666 --> 00:50:32,291
Which is why you even chose
the bridegroom for her, right?

733
00:50:32,292 --> 00:50:34,999
What a boy! He's one in a million!
Prem Singh!

734
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,209
- But he said it was Amar Singh.
- The old man's getting senile!

735
00:50:38,583 --> 00:50:41,374
Neither can he see nor hear properly!

736
00:50:41,375 --> 00:50:47,208
What can we do for you?

737
00:50:52,417 --> 00:50:56,541
Just tell me where the other old gentleman is.

738
00:50:57,042 --> 00:50:59,416
He's gone to sleep.

739
00:50:59,417 --> 00:51:02,582
I'm not feeling very good, too...

740
00:51:02,583 --> 00:51:05,041
...I think I too will
lie down for sometime.

741
00:51:05,042 --> 00:51:07,665
We've made all the
arrangements for you to lie down!

742
00:51:07,666 --> 00:51:12,792
- Where's my cane?
- Cane? Here it is!

743
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:18,792
You should have let me know,
if your disguise had come off.

744
00:51:19,334 --> 00:51:22,333
I too would have fled with you.

745
00:51:22,334 --> 00:51:25,124
May even my enemies not
have friends like you are!

746
00:51:25,125 --> 00:51:28,333
So, return to Bhopal.
This is simply not your ball-game.

747
00:51:28,334 --> 00:51:31,249
What are two cups for?
Take away one!

748
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:33,665
We'll share the tea.
It'll strengthen our friendship.

749
00:51:33,666 --> 00:51:35,916
Keep it there and scoot!

750
00:51:35,917 --> 00:51:37,916
To hell with your friendship!

751
00:51:37,917 --> 00:51:40,832
You always get me beaten up!
You think I'm a fool, eh?

752
00:51:40,833 --> 00:51:44,041
- I...
- Freeze!

753
00:51:44,042 --> 00:51:45,916
One punch and you'll break to pieces!

754
00:51:45,917 --> 00:51:48,083
Only my back is broken...
Not my elbow!

755
00:51:48,084 --> 00:51:49,957
- Threatening me with your elbow?
- No...

756
00:51:49,958 --> 00:51:52,415
What are you fighting for?

757
00:51:52,416 --> 00:51:55,750
There are only the two of you now.
I've already quit the race.

758
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:59,333
When were you in the race?
You can't be compared with me!

759
00:51:59,334 --> 00:52:02,374
I was in the race, too!

760
00:52:02,375 --> 00:52:05,917
But I forgot all about
romance, after seeing his fate.

761
00:52:06,334 --> 00:52:11,042
I'm happy as I am. But I'll always
help you. Till I breathe my last!

762
00:52:11,792 --> 00:52:15,249
Learn a thing or two from him!
Look how wise he's being!

763
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:17,499
Henceforth, you too start helping me, okay?

764
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:20,333
You'll see it, God will never forgive you!

765
00:52:20,334 --> 00:52:23,083
Why don't you people take turns in trying?

766
00:52:23,084 --> 00:52:26,083
That's a good idea!
I'll make the first attempt.

767
00:52:26,084 --> 00:52:29,041
First get into the position of making an attempt!

768
00:52:29,042 --> 00:52:30,957
You'll suffer the consequences of my curse!

769
00:52:30,958 --> 00:52:35,084
- Have you seen the film 'Sholay'?
- Yes. At least 10 times!

770
00:52:35,708 --> 00:52:38,166
- His father wrote it.
- Don't drag him into this!

771
00:52:38,167 --> 00:52:45,084
In 'Sholay', Amitabh and Dharmendra
tossed a coin to decide everything.

772
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:48,166
You do that, too. The winner
will make the first attempt.

773
00:52:48,167 --> 00:52:51,124
Yes!
Now, that's a good idea!

774
00:52:51,125 --> 00:52:53,083
We'll leave it to the toss.

775
00:52:53,084 --> 00:52:55,916
Winners are 'Conquerors'
losers are apes!

776
00:52:55,917 --> 00:52:59,249
Now listen...
Heads I win, Tails you lose.

777
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:01,749
- Is that okay?
- No! Reverse that!

778
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:04,874
Okay...
Tails you lose, Heads I win.

779
00:53:04,875 --> 00:53:08,708
Here goes the coin... and the winner...

780
00:53:09,167 --> 00:53:12,083
Tails you lose,
Heads I win!

781
00:53:12,084 --> 00:53:15,374
Here I come, Raveena!

782
00:53:15,375 --> 00:53:18,875
If he wins Heads, you win Tails.
You haven't lost! You've won!

783
00:53:19,416 --> 00:53:22,374
Oh yes!
I'm the conqueror!

784
00:53:22,375 --> 00:53:24,374
But he's made an ape out of you!

785
00:53:24,375 --> 00:53:27,582
My plan will take me straight
to the girl's bedroom!

786
00:53:27,583 --> 00:53:29,083
- To the bedroom?
- Absolutely!

787
00:53:29,084 --> 00:53:32,667
Once you reach the bedroom, it
won't take much to reach her heart.

788
00:53:33,042 --> 00:53:35,540
- Oh no!
- But there's a problem.

789
00:53:35,541 --> 00:53:38,083
- The stick.
- Stick?

790
00:53:38,084 --> 00:53:41,833
The girl must be somehow
made to give me the stick.

791
00:53:42,416 --> 00:53:45,707
- But why will she hit you?
- Because I'll worry her.

792
00:53:45,708 --> 00:53:49,333
- So, you'll worry her, too?!
- Yes, a lot...

793
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:52,959
- But why?
- Because I want her to hit me.

794
00:53:53,291 --> 00:53:54,999
Will you quietly get hit?

795
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,582
- With pleasure.
- Don't worry. I'll supply the stick.

796
00:53:58,583 --> 00:54:03,208
- Really?

797
00:54:38,583 --> 00:58:10,917
EROS

798
00:59:03,375 --> 00:59:06,207
She's killed him!
Is anybody there?!

799
00:59:06,208 --> 00:59:08,416
No! I haven't done this!

800
00:59:08,417 --> 00:59:10,916
I saw you doing it!

801
00:59:10,917 --> 00:59:13,249
It was your hand!
It was your club!

802
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:16,417
One hit and the poor chap died!

803
00:59:16,875 --> 00:59:19,749
Listen to me!
The club kept coming before me...

804
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:23,416
...and he continued misbehaving.
I held myself from hitting him...

805
00:59:23,417 --> 00:59:25,416
But you struck at last!

806
00:59:25,417 --> 00:59:27,957
Listen! Please don't call the Police!

807
00:59:27,958 --> 00:59:31,125
- Who else can I call?
- He's breathing! He'll get up.

808
00:59:31,583 --> 00:59:33,291
How will the poor chap wake up?

809
00:59:33,292 --> 00:59:35,749
It’ll take four people to haul him up now.

810
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:38,834
He's left the world for good!
He died at a young age!

811
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:44,000
No! Don't call the Police!
I'll get him cured!

812
00:59:44,834 --> 00:59:49,375
Please give me a hand!

813
00:59:55,584 --> 00:59:58,958
Where am I? Who am I?
Who are you people?

814
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:03,584
Where have I come from?
What's my name?

815
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,833
The poor chap's struck by amnesia!

816
01:00:06,834 --> 01:00:10,333
All this happened because
of the blow you gave him!

817
01:00:12,125 --> 01:00:14,040
Why do you keep scolding me?!

818
01:00:14,041 --> 01:00:17,583
Why is she crying? What blow?
Which blow?

819
01:00:17,584 --> 01:00:19,249
I can't understand anything.

820
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:22,292
Won't you people tell me?
You tell me! You'll have to!

821
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:27,624
What have you done, Raveena?

822
01:00:27,625 --> 01:00:30,583
You too scold me?!
I won't speak to anyone!

823
01:00:30,584 --> 01:00:32,541
I'll have to call the police now!

824
01:00:32,542 --> 01:00:35,457
Don't call the police.
Please!

825
01:00:35,458 --> 01:00:38,457
It was I who hit him,
I'll have him treated too.

826
01:00:38,458 --> 01:00:41,792
Till he recovers his memory,
I'll keep him here. Care for him!

827
01:00:42,625 --> 01:00:45,667
You're so nice...
So beautiful...

828
01:00:46,208 --> 01:00:48,416
...how much you care for me.

829
01:00:48,417 --> 01:00:51,416
What's your name, Miss Raveena?

830
01:00:51,417 --> 01:00:54,457
It's necessary for you to recover soon.

831
01:00:54,458 --> 01:00:57,875
- What's the hurry?
- Mr. Bajaj is arriving tomorrow.

832
01:00:58,584 --> 01:01:02,750
I've made a mistake, sir...
I forgot to tell you.

833
01:01:03,125 --> 01:01:06,916
Mr. Bajaj called from London
to say he's coming next week.

834
01:01:07,625 --> 01:01:10,666
Father's funny too!
He's left us here all alone.

835
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:13,833
There's some problem everyday.
He's not bothered about us!

836
01:01:14,208 --> 01:01:16,541
I think so, too.
He doesn't care for you.

837
01:01:16,542 --> 01:01:19,957
What kind of a father is he?
He should've been here. With you.

838
01:01:19,958 --> 01:01:23,333
Just think; two girls, poor things,
all alone in a strange city...

839
01:01:23,709 --> 01:01:28,917
Robert, dial his number.
I'll talk to him.

840
01:01:29,041 --> 01:01:35,375
Who am I?
Where am I?

841
01:01:41,333 --> 01:01:44,207
Who is this?

842
01:01:44,208 --> 01:01:47,709
You seemed to be pretty
decent in your younger days.

843
01:01:49,875 --> 01:01:51,541
You were fooled, weren't you?

844
01:01:51,542 --> 01:01:55,874
That's the game!
He's my brother, my twin-brother.

845
01:01:55,875 --> 01:01:57,583
Mr. Ramgopal Bajaj.

846
01:01:57,584 --> 01:02:03,708
My name's not Teja... it's Shyamgopal Bajaj.

847
01:02:05,208 --> 01:02:06,957
He was my father's pet.

848
01:02:06,958 --> 01:02:10,749
My old man used to love him a lot.

849
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:13,416
I wonder what spell he had them under...

850
01:02:13,417 --> 01:02:16,749
...but he was always considered to
be Lord Rama and I was Ravana.

851
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:22,375
I decided then that I'd knock off
my father and clear his cards, too.

852
01:02:23,083 --> 01:02:25,040
And I gave it a good try.

853
01:02:25,041 --> 01:02:29,584
As it happened, our clerk,
Harishankar, spilled the beans.

854
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:34,417
But it was good. He used to bore
me with a lot of holy mumbo-jumbo.

855
01:02:35,125 --> 01:02:40,083
I was sentenced to 10 years
of imprisonment in that case.

856
01:02:40,625 --> 01:02:42,666
I was in jail for 10 years!

857
01:02:42,667 --> 01:02:45,416
When I came out, the
whole scene had changed.

858
01:02:45,417 --> 01:02:48,709
He had gone away to London
and multiplied his 1 crore to 30!

859
01:02:49,208 --> 01:02:52,541
But sir, why didn't you go to London, too?

860
01:02:52,542 --> 01:02:56,459
How could I go to London?
The police is on my trail.

861
01:02:57,584 --> 01:03:02,083
Mogambo's nephew is hunting
me for the 5 lakhs I swindled.

862
01:03:02,459 --> 01:03:05,749
Don't I want to see London?
But how could I go?

863
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:10,500
But now the bad days are behind us.

864
01:03:11,083 --> 01:03:14,207
That girl is his daughter!

865
01:03:14,208 --> 01:03:17,374
Let him enter my domain just once...

866
01:03:17,375 --> 01:03:20,584
...I will not be defeated
like Ravana was!

867
01:03:21,083 --> 01:03:24,708
I'll 'lay out' all his cards!

868
01:03:26,375 --> 01:03:29,583
A profit of millions for only one murder?!

869
01:03:29,584 --> 01:03:32,999
Leave that to me, Mr. Teja.

870
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:37,167
I'll kill him in a manner he
won't even realize he's dead.

871
01:03:37,833 --> 01:03:41,125
But you will kill him only when
he comes to India, won't you?

872
01:03:41,916 --> 01:03:45,458
But when will he come to India?
When will he?

873
01:03:45,459 --> 01:03:48,500
His daughter's here, sir.
He'll certainly come, too!

874
01:03:49,459 --> 01:03:52,875
Good!
That's very good!

875
01:03:54,708 --> 01:04:00,708
Kill his daughter then!

876
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:04,875
- Who's that? Miss Raveena?
- What's it, Tilu?

877
01:04:05,417 --> 01:04:10,708
When I got up this morning,
I saw that I had lost my eye-sight.

878
01:04:11,334 --> 01:04:16,207
Where are we, by the way?

879
01:04:16,208 --> 01:04:19,416
The world seemed strange
when I lost my memory...

880
01:04:19,417 --> 01:04:22,833
...and now it's turning dark,
when I've lost my eye-sight.

881
01:04:23,625 --> 01:04:25,333
Get a grip on yourself, Tilu.

882
01:04:25,334 --> 01:04:28,375
Control, my foot!
Excuse me... step aside!

883
01:04:34,750 --> 01:04:36,458
Leave me! Leave me!

884
01:04:36,459 --> 01:04:38,458
- No!
- Let me go!

885
01:04:38,459 --> 01:04:40,333
I have right to live!

886
01:04:40,334 --> 01:04:44,417
- What's going on here?
- He's committing suicide.

887
01:04:44,833 --> 01:04:48,166
Oh?!
There's someone to see you, Madam.

888
01:04:48,167 --> 01:04:50,207
Let go of me!
Let me go, I said!

889
01:04:50,208 --> 01:04:54,416
Oh God!

890
01:04:54,417 --> 01:04:56,583
- Who are you?
- What is it?

891
01:04:56,584 --> 01:05:00,375
Please don't worry.
I'm a Police Doctor.

892
01:05:00,916 --> 01:05:03,832
Just as the police smells out the criminals...

893
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:07,375
...I reach the patients with the scent I get, too.

894
01:05:12,791 --> 01:05:17,458
Old?

895
01:05:17,875 --> 01:05:22,750
Khurana... not Purana (Old)...
Dr Prem Khurana!

896
01:05:24,375 --> 01:05:27,832
I have information that there's
a patient hiding in your house.

897
01:05:27,833 --> 01:05:31,207
I didn't do it deliberately...
I was only standing with the club...

898
01:05:31,208 --> 01:05:33,749
I know that!
But where is he?

899
01:05:33,750 --> 01:05:36,041
How should we have known
that he'd lose his memory?

900
01:05:36,042 --> 01:05:38,333
Tilu's eye-sight is failing him, too.

901
01:05:38,334 --> 01:05:41,458
- Tilu?
- Yes, we found him at the Lake...

902
01:05:41,459 --> 01:05:43,790
...so we call him Tilu.

903
01:05:43,791 --> 01:05:47,374
He'll see everything clearly
when he catches sight of me!

904
01:05:47,375 --> 01:05:49,416
Hasn't he recognized me?!

905
01:05:49,417 --> 01:05:52,665
- Will he get back his memory then?
- Of the last seven births!

906
01:05:52,666 --> 01:05:55,750
- I know this ailment well.
- Who's he, Miss Raveena?

907
01:05:56,250 --> 01:05:57,874
He's a doctor.

908
01:05:57,875 --> 01:06:00,917
I'm a pretty old hand.

909
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:04,041
He seems more like a carpenter!

910
01:06:04,042 --> 01:06:06,749
- My father was a carpenter.
- I don't want him treating me.

911
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:09,082
Give me poison instead.
I'd rather die.

912
01:06:09,083 --> 01:06:12,374
I'll fulfill that wish too.
Leave her hand.

913
01:06:12,375 --> 01:06:14,916
- No.
- Let go of her hand!

914
01:06:14,917 --> 01:06:18,665
He has a contagious disease!

915
01:06:18,666 --> 01:06:21,874
Everything will be okay, now that I've come.

916
01:06:21,875 --> 01:06:24,874
The name's Prem...
Prem Khurana.

917
01:06:24,875 --> 01:06:30,458
See how I set him right now.

918
01:06:47,209 --> 01:06:49,624
Our friendship?! Have you forgotten?
I'm your friend, after all!

919
01:06:49,625 --> 01:06:51,582
- To hell with it!
- I feel like strangling you!

920
01:06:51,583 --> 01:06:55,334
I'll give you an injection meant
for horses. You'll neigh, too!

921
01:06:55,958 --> 01:06:59,416
What are you discussing with him?

922
01:06:59,417 --> 01:07:04,834
- That's very confidential.
- Confidential?

923
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,374
Distractions! Tilu!
The treatment!

924
01:07:15,375 --> 01:07:16,749
What's all this?

925
01:07:16,750 --> 01:07:19,749
You can understand this, Miss.
I don't want my memory.

926
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:21,874
I'll manage with what little I have.

927
01:07:21,875 --> 01:07:25,041
This is a disease which spreads at his touch!

928
01:07:25,042 --> 01:07:28,750
To treat him, you must
keep him away from food.

929
01:07:29,334 --> 01:07:33,042
Will he recover his memory if
he's hit on the same spot again?

930
01:07:33,375 --> 01:07:35,457
- That's possible.
- Oh no!

931
01:07:35,458 --> 01:07:37,832
Can we give him another blow then?

932
01:07:37,833 --> 01:07:45,083
He must be hit on the same spot.
A hard blow!

933
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:49,042
I'll hit him! I'll succeed if
I give him two or four blows!

934
01:07:49,666 --> 01:07:52,540
I've had it!

935
01:07:52,541 --> 01:07:55,749
You hit him earlier, Miss Raveena.
Let me try now.

936
01:07:55,750 --> 01:08:00,541
You're going to get a sound thrashing!

937
01:08:06,084 --> 01:08:08,083
Leave this to me.

938
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:12,042
Only tell me when and how
many blows he must be given.

939
01:08:12,583 --> 01:08:13,749
Can I try, sir?

940
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:16,917
Two and two...
Four in all!

941
01:08:22,708 --> 01:08:28,125
Everybody will be given a fair chance.

942
01:08:29,084 --> 01:08:31,582
Give him two blows, when he gets up.

943
01:08:31,583 --> 01:08:34,999
Keep giving him two blows, as
and when he wants to sleep.

944
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:40,208
I get up before everybody else does, sir.

945
01:08:58,875 --> 01:09:00,624
There's nothing to worry about, is there Doctor?

946
01:09:00,625 --> 01:09:03,792
I've given him the injection.
He needs blessings and blows now.

947
01:09:04,292 --> 01:09:05,791
Don't forget to keep hitting him.

948
01:09:05,792 --> 01:09:08,166
Till he recovers,
I'll stay here.

949
01:09:08,167 --> 01:09:11,624
- An unwanted guest?
- That's how I am.

950
01:09:11,625 --> 01:09:13,916
Accommodate him in the outhouse, Robert.

951
01:09:13,917 --> 01:09:16,707
Not there; In this house, near your room.

952
01:09:16,708 --> 01:09:19,916
- Give me the room opposite mine.
- Is there nothing adjoining?

953
01:09:19,917 --> 01:09:26,292
- There is. Near mine.
- Opposite will do. Thanks.

954
01:09:28,541 --> 01:09:31,083
The doctor's very nice. Isn't he?

955
01:09:31,084 --> 01:09:33,582
Gone crazy over him, have you?

956
01:09:33,583 --> 01:09:37,916
Hurry up...
We've to give Tilu some blows.

957
01:09:37,917 --> 01:09:41,209
- This is a unique bouquet, Robert.
- It's beautiful, sir.

958
01:09:41,583 --> 01:09:44,999
- I've kept a time-bomb in it.
- You hold it.

959
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,832
It's time for Raveena to come out.

960
01:09:47,833 --> 01:09:52,292
When she smilingly picks it up,
it'll blast at the appointed time.

961
01:09:52,750 --> 01:09:56,291
And that will be the
last 'time' of her life.

962
01:09:56,292 --> 01:09:58,999
It's time for you to keep the bouquet.

963
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,374
But if I keep it, the police will...

964
01:10:01,375 --> 01:10:05,291
Don't worry, Robert.
I've written Tilu's name on it.

965
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:09,500
Tilu will go to prison, and Raveena to heaven.

966
01:10:10,042 --> 01:10:13,625
It's like killing two people using the same arrow!

967
01:10:13,875 --> 01:10:17,458
It's like killing two, with one arrow.

968
01:10:18,250 --> 01:10:21,333
Go now. There's very little
time in the time-bomb left.

969
01:10:21,708 --> 01:10:26,375
Have you switched it on?!

970
01:10:30,375 --> 01:10:34,707
- Is the car ready, Robert?
- No! Yes... it is!

971
01:10:34,708 --> 01:10:39,041
No!

972
01:10:39,042 --> 01:10:42,167
I've kept the time-bomb on the table, sir.

973
01:10:42,708 --> 01:10:44,415
Raveena will be out soon.

974
01:10:44,416 --> 01:10:48,500
Good-timing is okay, but
when will good times come?

975
01:10:48,959 --> 01:10:52,374
Good times will be upon us very soon...

976
01:10:52,375 --> 01:10:56,999
What's that?
Flowers?!

977
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,208
For Raveena? From Tilu?!

978
01:10:59,209 --> 01:11:01,666
You dare do this!
I'll put my name there...

979
01:11:01,667 --> 01:11:06,541
What's going on, Doctor?
Who are you giving the bouquet to?

980
01:11:07,416 --> 01:11:10,457
And what's this behind you?
What are you hiding?

981
01:11:10,458 --> 01:11:13,749
For Raveena, is it?
...Tilu!

982
01:11:13,750 --> 01:11:15,415
Your name instead of mine, eh?

983
01:11:15,416 --> 01:11:18,666
Don't mess with me...
Mr. Tilu!

984
01:11:18,667 --> 01:11:20,582
Who's Tilu?
I'll give you a kick!

985
01:11:20,583 --> 01:11:22,415
What's up?
What's happening, Tilu?

986
01:11:22,416 --> 01:11:26,250
I brought you flowers, but the
doctor wants to beat me up!

987
01:11:27,167 --> 01:11:30,374
- Well, doctor?
- I brought the flowers!

988
01:11:30,375 --> 01:11:31,999
- I brought them!
- I did!

989
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:37,083
- I brought them!
- I did!

990
01:11:56,667 --> 01:11:58,290
Start counting, Robert.

991
01:11:58,291 --> 01:12:02,958
Have the good times arrived?

992
01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:08,125
- You threw it!
- You did!

993
01:12:22,208 --> 01:12:24,041
What you mean to say is that...

994
01:12:24,042 --> 01:12:27,458
...you couldn't play the 'game'
because of those two clowns.

995
01:12:28,333 --> 01:12:30,874
Very good.

996
01:12:30,875 --> 01:12:35,041
I've got great satisfaction.

997
01:12:35,042 --> 01:12:38,249
Sorry, sir.
We made a mistake my oversight.

998
01:12:38,250 --> 01:12:40,541
Those two boys are very smart, sir.

999
01:12:40,542 --> 01:12:42,541
At breakfast yesterday...

1000
01:12:42,542 --> 01:12:47,750
Please don't worry, Mr. Teja.

1001
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:52,834
A snoring rat can't awaken a lion, can it?

1002
01:12:53,834 --> 01:12:56,999
- According to our new plan...
- Shut up!

1003
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,041
You and your 'plans'!

1004
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:02,332
I'm going through a bad patch!

1005
01:13:02,333 --> 01:13:07,166
They speak like lions and are
not even rats themselves!

1006
01:13:07,667 --> 01:13:09,958
I don't want any excuses this time.

1007
01:13:09,959 --> 01:13:12,207
Do anything, but finish the 'game'.

1008
01:13:12,208 --> 01:13:15,749
And this time, come here
with the news of their death!

1009
01:13:15,750 --> 01:13:18,374
I'll come with the corpse, if you wish.

1010
01:13:18,375 --> 01:13:21,999
Or better still, I'll kill her here in your presence.

1011
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:27,166
We've very smartly managed to
discover something more, Sir.

1012
01:13:27,792 --> 01:13:32,250
Mr. Bajaj of London has converted
all his wealth into diamonds.

1013
01:13:32,708 --> 01:13:35,041
He'll arrive here in 10 days.

1014
01:13:35,042 --> 01:13:40,791
We heard that when he was talking
to his daughter over the phone.

1015
01:13:41,291 --> 01:13:44,041
- What did boss say?
- I couldn't hear him.

1016
01:13:44,042 --> 01:13:48,375
But he definitely must have said 'smart boy'!

1017
01:13:50,208 --> 01:13:52,749
Will I get food today,
Miss Raveena?

1018
01:13:52,750 --> 01:13:54,874
- Yes, you will.
- Really?

1019
01:13:54,875 --> 01:13:56,874
Certainly.

1020
01:13:56,875 --> 01:14:00,542
- Has the doctor left?
- Forget him and eat. Okay?

1021
01:14:03,208 --> 01:14:05,249
So much of food?!
For me?!

1022
01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:08,333
Careful!

1023
01:14:11,042 --> 01:14:14,916
Who hit me?

1024
01:14:14,917 --> 01:14:18,166
All that food is for us.

1025
01:14:18,917 --> 01:14:21,374
And this food is for you.

1026
01:14:21,375 --> 01:14:26,250
Pepper-balls, ginger sweets...

1027
01:14:27,834 --> 01:14:33,499
...bitter gourd soup and chilies-salad.

1028
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:36,709
I think I'm recovering my memory!

1029
01:14:37,792 --> 01:14:41,165
- Anything else?
- No.

1030
01:14:41,166 --> 01:14:43,124
Your treatment continues then.

1031
01:14:43,125 --> 01:14:46,040
Eat it, Tilu.
You'll recover soon.

1032
01:14:46,041 --> 01:14:49,625
Eat it as if it were medicine.
The doctor himself made it.

1033
01:14:50,375 --> 01:14:54,125
I'd rather die than eat this!

1034
01:14:55,792 --> 01:14:58,791
How can you die like this, Tilu?

1035
01:14:58,792 --> 01:15:02,208
We won't let you die so easily, after all.

1036
01:15:03,125 --> 01:15:07,291
Feed him with your hands, Miss.
He'll have to eat then...

1037
01:15:07,875 --> 01:15:11,709
Else, it'll break her heart.

1038
01:15:12,458 --> 01:15:17,000
Eat this...

1039
01:15:36,417 --> 01:15:42,458
You're very smart, doctor.

1040
01:15:53,041 --> 01:15:54,666
Who's all that food for, Robert?

1041
01:15:54,667 --> 01:15:56,874
It's for the doctor, sir.

1042
01:15:56,875 --> 01:16:00,834
- Is it something special?
- Yes. Especially for him.

1043
01:16:01,958 --> 01:16:04,457
With lots of butter and clarified butter.

1044
01:16:04,458 --> 01:16:06,249
I can't hope for all this.

1045
01:16:06,250 --> 01:16:10,041
Could you get my medicines from
upstairs? I'll live on them now.

1046
01:16:10,625 --> 01:16:12,666
- I'll get it, sir.
- Hurry.

1047
01:16:12,667 --> 01:16:18,667
Pepper-balls for me and
mutton-soup for you, eh?!

1048
01:16:19,208 --> 01:16:22,915
Here's purgative meant for horses.
It really knocks them out!

1049
01:16:22,916 --> 01:16:28,625
- You'll crave for food!
- Is dinner served, Robert?

1050
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:36,499
Does it have enough of butter, Robert?

1051
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:41,000
This is delicious...

1052
01:16:48,834 --> 01:16:50,291
Is anything left?

1053
01:16:50,292 --> 01:16:55,207
No...
The food was excellent today.

1054
01:16:55,208 --> 01:16:57,207
- Where's Miss Raveena, Robert?
- Upstairs.

1055
01:16:57,208 --> 01:17:03,458
"For the very first time, I've seen
Love in my beloved's eyes"

1056
01:17:04,333 --> 01:17:08,500
"Now is when my heart is contented, too"

1057
01:17:12,542 --> 01:17:18,875
It's you?
Please come, doctor.

1058
01:17:19,375 --> 01:17:22,541
- Stop calling me doctor.
- Well?

1059
01:17:22,542 --> 01:17:25,791
You can call me Prem.

1060
01:17:25,792 --> 01:17:30,500
Have some oranges.

1061
01:17:31,041 --> 01:17:35,417
- I want to say something to you.
- Yes?

1062
01:17:36,875 --> 01:17:42,209
Actually, this has to do with the heart.

1063
01:17:42,584 --> 01:17:47,458
Yes...
From quite some time now...

1064
01:17:47,709 --> 01:17:52,292
Go on.

1065
01:17:53,292 --> 01:17:58,750
- Yes?
- Give me two minutes.

1066
01:18:09,041 --> 01:18:12,916
- Please come, doctor.
- I asked you not to call me doctor.

1067
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:19,374
- Call me Prem.
- Have some oranges.
