1
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:31,615
Motherfucking cocksucker.
Motherfucking shit fucker!

2
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,867
What am I doing?
What am I doing?

3
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:37,162
I don't know what I'm doing.
I'm doing the best that I can.

4
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:39,540
I know that's all
I can ask of myself.

5
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:42,626
But is that good enough?
Is my work doing any good?

6
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:45,921
Is anybody paying attention?
Is it hopeless to try and change things?

7
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:48,298
The African guy's a sign, right?
Because if he isn't...

8
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,801
then nothing in this world
makes any sense to me.

9
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,387
I'm fucked. Maybe I should quit.
Don't quit.

10
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:55,722
Maybe I should just fucking quit.
Don't fucking quit.

11
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:58,559
I don't know what the fuck
I'm supposed to fucking do anymore.

12
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:01,144
Fucker. Fuck! Shit!

13
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:03,647
I'm glad we saved
a piece of this marsh.

14
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,149
I know it's small,
but at least it's something.

15
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:08,610
Don't stop fighting.

16
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:11,154
We're going to save
a lot more of this place.

17
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:14,491
To celebrate, I have
a poem I'd like to read.

18
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:17,494
"Nobody sits
like this rock sits.

19
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:21,498
"You rock, rock.
The rock just sits and is.

20
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:25,043
You show us how to just sit here,
and that's what we need."

21
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:29,214
Yeah, we did it.

22
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:33,218
- Any press come?
- Yeah, local paper's here. What's wrong?

23
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:36,847
Nothing. It's just I have an appointment
to check out this African guy.

24
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,642
- What African guy?
- Exactly. What African guy?

25
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:15,511
Come on.

26
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:40,345
Hello. Albert Markovski.
I have a 1::00 appointment.

27
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,431
Sorry, I'm late.
This place is like a maze.

28
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:44,516
Have a seat.
We'll be right with you.

29
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:14,421
Why don't you just tell me
what your situation is.

30
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:18,509
Look, I'm not really sure I know exactly
what you guys do here, all right?

31
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:21,178
Well, we, uh... We'll investigate
and solve your case.

32
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,722
- How?
- If you sign a contract, we'll follow you.

33
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:25,098
- You'll spy?
- Yes.

34
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:26,767
- On me?
- Yes.

35
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:29,686
- Will you be spying on me in the bathroom?
- Yes.

36
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,813
- In the bathroom?
- Yes.

37
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:33,857
- Why?
- There's nothing too small.

38
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:37,319
You know when police find the slightest
bit of D.N.A. And build a case?

39
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,613
If we might see you...
you floss or masturbate...

40
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:42,074
that could be the key
to your entire reality.

41
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,159
- So I'm hiring you to spy on me.
- That's right.

42
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:47,579
So we can figure out your situation
and resolve your crisis.

43
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,916
In addition, my associate will approach
your case from a different angle.

44
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,752
What do you mean a different angle?
What does that mean?

45
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:57,756
Regarding your perception of reality.
He'll tell you about that.

46
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:01,134
- Who sent you here?
- Nobody. I found your card.

47
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:05,430
- Where?
- In some fancy restaurant
that I'd never been to before.

48
00:05:05,556 --> 00:05:10,102
I didn't have the proper attire.
So they let me borrow a suitjacket.

49
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:13,730
I reached into my pocket,
and there was your card.

50
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,899
The weird thing is
I always have a jacket.

51
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:17,943
- But not that day?
- No.

52
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:22,239
- Brad Stand.
- Hey.

53
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,742
- Kind of a coincidence.
- Yes, exactly. My case is a coincidence.

54
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,704
- About the restaurant and thejacket?
- No, no. That-That's...

55
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:31,957
I'm talking about a big coincidence.
It involves one man.

56
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:34,668
It's a three-parter.
Okay. Ready?

57
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:36,795
First part.

58
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,214
I went to a place
called Schottinger's photo archives.

59
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:41,508
I was there getting stills
of early Bob Dylan.

60
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:44,720
In comes this tall African guy.
He's like 18 years old or something.

61
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:47,264
You know, he's in there getting photos
of Morris Chestnut...

62
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,349
Shaquille O'Neal,
Jim Carrey.

63
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:52,102
He's an autograph hound.
Kind of guy likes to get...

64
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:54,104
glossies of famous people
and get them signed.

65
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:56,231
Two weeks later, I see
the same African guy.

66
00:05:56,315 --> 00:05:58,317
He's working as a doorman
at my friend's building.

67
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:00,277
Oh, my God!

68
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,071
- Who's your friend?
- Jay Wendorff. But it's not his apartment.

69
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:05,199
- It's his girlfriend's.
- What's her name?

70
00:06:05,324 --> 00:06:09,286
Uh, Kelly. Kelly Coulter.
So, okay, that's two.

71
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,371
One time at Schottinger's
photo archive...

72
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,665
second time
as the doorman.

73
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:17,628
Third, I see this man,
he's in a van at the mall.

74
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,422
- What are you doing at the mall?
- I'm working.

75
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:23,091
I'm making a statement for the open spaces.

76
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:25,928
Yeah, he's back.
You crazy bastard.

77
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:28,222
You don't plant no tree
in this parking lot!

78
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:32,476
I gotta come take that tree,
remove it and let traffic through.

79
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,645
You'rejust creatin'
more work for me.

80
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:40,108
- They're not always meaningful.
- Yeah, it's meaningful.

81
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:44,154
- Meaningful how?
- That's what I want you to find out.

82
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:47,074
- About your life.
- Yeah, about my life.

83
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,744
And about the whole thing.
About the universe, you know? The big one.

84
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:54,373
I mean, should I keep doing
what I'm doing? Is it hopeless?

85
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:56,583
Mr. Markovski, we see
a lot of people in here...

86
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,878
who claim they want to know
the ultimate truth about reality.

87
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:02,673
They want to peer under the surface
at the big everything...

88
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:05,342
but this can be a very painful
process full of surprises.

89
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,886
It can dismantle the world
as you know it.

90
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:11,849
That's why most people prefer to remain
on the surface of things.

91
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,434
Maybe you should go home.
Let sleeping dogs lie.

92
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,812
Take it easy.
What do you say?

93
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:19,523
I say don't give me
the brush-off. Please.

94
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:22,359
I want to know.
This is big.

95
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:26,530
- Have you ever transcended space and time?
- Yes. No.

96
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:29,658
Uh, time not space. No, I don't know
what you're talking about.

97
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:32,411
I take it you don't
make very much money, Mr. Markovski.

98
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:35,205
Is that gonna be a problem?
Are you expensive, what you do?

99
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:38,834
We have a sliding scale.
Some of our clients pay $30 a week.

100
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:41,170
Some of our wealthy clients
pay several thousand a week.

101
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:44,590
I can't believe you guys actually exist.
How long have you been doing this?

102
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:47,217
- Seventeen years, 352 cases.
- That's crazy.

103
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:50,345
I'm gonna have to ask you
to please steer clear of my office...

104
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:53,056
because my work situation
is a little shaky, all right?

105
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,100
You want us to stay
away from your job?

106
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:57,394
Yeah. If you come snooping
around my office...

107
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,439
it could make me look unstable
and it could hurt me.

108
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:04,610
I want you
to meet my colleague.

109
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,446
- Bernard?
- Uh-huh.

110
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:09,281
- This is Mr. Markovski.
- Hi.

111
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:12,743
- He's going to have to be pro bono.
- Okay. Sounds good.

112
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,953
Thank you very much
for taking on my case.

113
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:17,289
- Oh, you're welcome. You're welcome.
- Hold on.

114
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:20,417
- He hasn't signed a contract.
- Let's do this and then we'll get to the contract.

115
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:24,421
- It's too much too soon.
- It's always too much too soon.
That's the nature of the beast.

116
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:26,590
- Approach, patience, finesse.
- Will you stop?

117
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:29,051
- Come on.
- We need to start with his specifics, Bernard.

118
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:31,553
We need to go past logic though.
Come on. Let's go.

119
00:08:31,637 --> 00:08:33,722
- Give me a kiss. Come on.
- Okay.

120
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:40,020
Will you tell me where
we're having dinner tonight?

121
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:43,106
- Korean barbecue.
- Really?

122
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:48,737
Okay, let's get started.

123
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,948
Is this part
of my investigation?

124
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:55,077
Yes. Say this blanket represents all the matter
and energy in the universe, okay?

125
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,162
You, me, everything.

126
00:08:57,287 --> 00:09:00,249
Nothing has been left out, all right?
All the particles, everything.

127
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:03,001
- What's outside this blanket?
- More blankets. That's the point.

128
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,212
- Blanket's everything.
- Exactly. This is everything.

129
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:08,924
Let's just say
that this is me, all right?

130
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:11,885
And I'm, what, 60-odd years old
and I'm wearing a gray suit.

131
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,930
Blah, blah, blah.
And let's say over here, this is you.

132
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:17,975
And, you're... I don't know,
you're 21. You got dark hair, etc.

133
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:22,229
And over here, this is Vivian,
my wife and colleague.

134
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:26,233
Then over here, this is
the Eiffel tower, right? It's Paris.

135
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:29,319
And this is a war.
And this is, uh, a museum.

136
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:31,989
And this is a disease.
And this is an orgasm.

137
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,157
And this is a hamburger.

138
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:37,744
- Everything is the same even if it's different.
- Exactly.

139
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:41,248
But our everyday mind forgets this.
We think everything is separate.

140
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:44,459
Limited. I'm over here.
You're over there. Which is true.

141
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:47,546
But it's not the whole truth
because we're all connected.

142
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:49,631
Because we... are connected.

143
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:51,717
- Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure.
- Okay?

144
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:54,761
- Yeah.
- All right, now, we need to learn...

145
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:58,140
how to see the blanket truth
all the time.

146
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:01,768
Right in the everyday stuff.
And that's what this is for.

147
00:10:01,894 --> 00:10:04,479
- Why?
- Why what?

148
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:08,150
Why do I need to learn how to see the blanket
thing all the time in the everyday stuff?

149
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,611
You wouldn't want to miss out
on the big picture, would you?

150
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:12,863
- Uh-uh.
- That's partly why you're here, right?

151
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,115
And this is it. I'm talking
about it right now.

152
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,326
It will take a while
for you to get it, you know?

153
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:19,912
But... it will help you.

154
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:24,458
- How?
- When you get the blanket thing you can relax...

155
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:30,422
because everything you could ever want
or be, you already have and are.

156
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:33,383
- That sound pretty good?
- That sounds very good.

157
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:36,220
- All right, get in.
- You want me to get in?

158
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:39,264
- So, get in here?
- Yeah.

159
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:42,893
- What's going to happen to me in there?
- Oh, hey, you're gonna see.

160
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,937
You'll find out.

161
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:58,867
The purpose of this suit, Mr. Markovski,
is to help shut down...

162
00:10:58,951 --> 00:11:03,330
your everyday perceptions
and give up your usual identity...

163
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:06,750
that you think separates you from everything.

164
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:09,628
This room,
this street...

165
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:13,715
this town, this country,
this economy...

166
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:16,635
this history,
this planet.

167
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,555
Your body,
your senses, yourjob.

168
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:21,974
Everything that
you identify with.

169
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:27,145
Hey, man. How's it going?
You're an asshole.

170
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:29,773
We will fucking
destroy you, deary.

171
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:33,485
Got Shaquille O'Neal. I like Shaq.

172
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,571
Hey.

173
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:39,950
- Brad Stand.
- Hey, how are you?

174
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,160
So what's the Open Spaces
take on that?

175
00:11:42,286 --> 00:11:45,080
Well, I think you guys
can definitely rebuild in areas...

176
00:11:45,164 --> 00:11:47,875
that are already run-down
instead of tearing up new land.

177
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,169
- New land. New land.
- We're open to that.

178
00:11:50,294 --> 00:11:52,713
That's who we are at Open Spaces.
We can't throw that away.

179
00:11:52,838 --> 00:11:56,175
We're not asking you to throw that away.
I'm not gonna bullshit you, right?

180
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,636
Part of this is we took a beating in the press
for all our growth.

181
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,889
Opening so many stores
in such a short time.

182
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:05,017
So if we work with you
and your Open Spaces Coalition...

183
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:07,853
is that gonna help
the Huckabees image?

184
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:10,898
Yes. Does it
help me? Yes.

185
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:14,860
Do I benefit from getting some great P.R.
For Huckabees when we need it? Absolutely.

186
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:19,281
But do I care about
saving the open spaces? Yes, I do.

187
00:12:24,036 --> 00:12:26,622
Don't look at me.
What's wrong with you?

188
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:28,790
Beat it, you little pussy.

189
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:34,630
- What's wrong with you?
- Pussy.
- You're an asshole.

190
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:37,216
- How are you? Okay? You doing okay?

191
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:39,927
I thought you said that
was going to relax me.

192
00:12:40,052 --> 00:12:42,554
Eventually, but you have to
practice at home. Okay?

193
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:45,933
You got a lot of layers
in there, don't you? Huh? All right?

194
00:12:46,058 --> 00:12:48,018
- Yeah.
- Okay.

195
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,687
How am I supposed to practice at home?
I don't have one of these.

196
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:52,856
It doesn't matter.
What you can do... It...

197
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:56,068
Just use an eye mask
or shut your eyes, okay?

198
00:12:56,193 --> 00:12:57,402
Oh.

199
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:58,237
Oh.

200
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:26,765
Um, hi. What should
I be doing?

201
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,892
Whatever you normally do.

202
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,869
I wanted to thank you
for what you did with the oak tree.

203
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:31,663
I played in that tree when I was little.
I thought we had a chance...

204
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,790
but they chopped it to pieces.

205
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:36,418
Hi. I have some questions...

206
00:14:36,502 --> 00:14:40,881
about power lines over the playground
where my daughter goes to school.

207
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:44,301
Please call me.
I'm Marjorie at 96...

208
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,679
- Hey, we got to talk, man.
- Hey, what's going on? Where is everybody?

209
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:49,932
- Brad moved the meeting.
- He what?

210
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:52,643
- To Huckabees corporate.
- Listen. Okay. I want you to do this.

211
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:55,938
I want you to get me the national office
on the phone right now.

212
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:59,525
Call Orrin Spence and tell him
that Brad is trying to hijack my coalition.

213
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:02,486
- This should've gone
to the other chapter a week ago.
- I want those flyers...

214
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:05,072
- outta the parking lot.
- It's a free country. The poems work.

215
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:07,241
- Oh, you are pissing people off.
- Oh, no, I'm not.

216
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:09,743
- Yeah, you really are. You're pissing people...
- No, I'm not.

217
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:12,871
If my poems had gone out with the
Shania mailing, it'd be a different story.

218
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:15,541
You know what? You're not leading
this coalition anymore.

219
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:18,126
- I am the coalition. I wrote the charter.
- Uh-huh. Not for long.

220
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:21,380
- Tell him it's important.
- I'm not going to any meeting at Huckabees.

221
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:24,633
- I can't get 'em.
- Can you just keep trying? Just keep trying.

222
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:27,261
Orrin Spence. Brad cannot
do this to us, all right?

223
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:29,680
- How can she get you out of the charter, man?
- She can't!

224
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:33,433
This is my work situation, the one
I was telling you about. It's a little...

225
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:35,978
I'll describe it later
to you if we could just...

226
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:39,815
- Don't worry, Albert. We're gonna
knock that meeting on its ass.
- Copy these and get these out.

227
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:43,735
You're fighting suburban sprawl and this fellow,
Brad Stand, and you have had a falling out.

228
00:15:43,861 --> 00:15:46,446
Remember, I told you
not to come by my work?

229
00:15:46,572 --> 00:15:49,700
Oh, yes, I remember. Now, tell me,
did the coalition inspire the poetry?

230
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:52,286
- Or did the poetry inspire the coalition?
- This is looking weird.

231
00:15:52,411 --> 00:15:55,455
- Can we schedule a time when you can come by?
- This thread of your...

232
00:15:55,581 --> 00:15:59,459
This has nothing to do with my coincidence.
My coincidence has to do with an African man.

233
00:15:59,585 --> 00:16:03,380
Viv! Viv! Mr. Corn is having a crisis.
You better talk to him. Mr. Corn, crisis.

234
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,591
- Tommy, what is it?
- I got a serious situation here.

235
00:16:05,716 --> 00:16:08,844
- Tell me what's happening.
- She wants to talk about my work situation.

236
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:11,722
- I want to know about my coincidences.
- What's happening now?

237
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:13,974
This is what's happening now.
She's spying...

238
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:16,810
- Talking about the blanket.
- I don't want to do the blanket right now.

239
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:18,937
Like this.

240
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:33,410
Wait a minute. Whoa.
What's going on?

241
00:16:33,494 --> 00:16:35,662
I need facts, Bernard,
to piece together a theory.

242
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:38,665
No time for infinity?
Gotta piece together a theory?

243
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,959
- This isn't cool.
- What? What?

244
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:44,421
Listen, you go visit Mr. Corn.
His wife is leaving him.

245
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:46,757
I think I've got a really
hot lead, Bernard.

246
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,885
Albert, the universe is an infinite sphere
whose center is everywhere...

247
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:52,095
and whose circumference
is nowhere.

248
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:54,473
Well, how can the center
be everywhere if...

249
00:16:56,975 --> 00:17:00,771
- She just dove into the back of Angela's car.
- You gotta keep using the method.

250
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:04,233
I gotta check on... on, uh,
Mr. Corn right now, okay?

251
00:17:04,316 --> 00:17:07,945
That method works.
Don't forget to use it, all right?

252
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,491
Mmm. Mmm! Mm.

253
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:34,513
Jimbo, everything
on this lawn goes.

254
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:37,015
The microwave,
the coffee grinder.

255
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:40,143
Baby! Baby, come on.

256
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:42,312
Don't do this, please.

257
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:45,107
Hey, don't do this.

258
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:48,527
- You don't need anyone.
- That's not true. I need you guys.

259
00:17:48,652 --> 00:17:50,612
If nothing matters,
how can I matter?

260
00:17:50,696 --> 00:17:53,156
I don't know if nothingness matters
or somethingness matters.

261
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,576
I'm trying to figure that out
and I want you to help me.

262
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:57,661
Somethingness, nothingness.
You know what?

263
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:00,914
L-l-l... You figure it out.
Let go! Let go of me!

264
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,584
Okay, uh, hold on now.
Tell me what happened. Okay?

265
00:18:03,709 --> 00:18:05,836
She won't stay
and share this with me.

266
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,547
- T-Tell me what that is.
- It's important to me. I see it so clearly.

267
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:11,049
- Yeah?
- You use petroleum, you're
a murderer. That's a fact.

268
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:13,177
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Murderer. A murderer?

269
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,929
One... killin' the ozone
and all the creatures that it's hurting?

270
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:19,266
- Calm down.
- Two... killing Arabs in oil-
producing dictatorships...

271
00:18:19,391 --> 00:18:22,269
where everybody is poor...
that is cruelty and it's inhumane.

272
00:18:22,394 --> 00:18:25,105
- You've talked to me about this.
- So if this world is temporary...

273
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,065
- Yeah.
- Identity is an illusion...

274
00:18:27,191 --> 00:18:29,735
- Yeah.
- Then everything is meaningless
and it doesn't matter if you...

275
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,820
- No. It...
- That's got me very confused.

276
00:18:31,904 --> 00:18:34,114
No, it matters. It matters.
It matters. Look, Tommy.

277
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:36,783
See, this is the universe.
And that's our galaxy over here.

278
00:18:36,909 --> 00:18:40,037
- What universe?
- What universe? This. Tommy, come on.

279
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,122
Come on. There's dust
and gas there.

280
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:43,916
- Yeah?
- There's us over here...

281
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:46,043
and good and bad luck
in the middle.

282
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:48,629
- That's chaos. That's my "B."
- This doesn't sound like you.

283
00:18:48,754 --> 00:18:51,215
- No, Vauban talks about space.
- Where'd you get that book?

284
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:54,468
- You sent it to me.
- No, no. We would never give you this book.

285
00:18:54,593 --> 00:18:58,096
- You didn't send this?
- Caterine Vauban's full of shit.
What is she doing here?

286
00:18:58,222 --> 00:19:00,265
God, she never leaves Paris.
This is insane.

287
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,893
- This is a pretty good book. You should read this.
- What?

288
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:05,270
She says nothing's connected,
doesn't matter what you do...

289
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:07,648
you can drive a car,
you can burn up gas...

290
00:19:07,773 --> 00:19:10,025
- Yeah?
- Which would explain the way things actually are...

291
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:12,486
where people do destructive things
like it doesn't matter.

292
00:19:12,611 --> 00:19:15,447
Tommy, Tommy, everything is connected
and everything matters.

293
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:17,866
There's not an atom
in our bodies...

294
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:20,118
that has not been forged
in the furnace of the sun.

295
00:19:20,244 --> 00:19:22,287
- Now, isn't that cool? Huh?
- Yes.

296
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:24,456
- That's a cool thing, isn't it?
- But...

297
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:26,625
But what? You tell me where
she contradicts that.

298
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,794
- Oh, right here.
- Where? Where?

299
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:31,380
- There...
- Where?

300
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:36,051
"Less than 5% of the cosmos is composed of
the same elements that compose human life."

301
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:38,554
- You know...
- There you go. That means we're all alone...

302
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:40,264
and we're miserable
and isolated.

303
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:42,349
Molly, if you...
Listen. If you...

304
00:19:42,474 --> 00:19:45,143
If you leave him before he gets
done dismantling...

305
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:48,063
he will never make it
to the other side, okay?

306
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:50,274
You know what? I'm done
with the dismantling.

307
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:53,652
- You don't want to ask these questions?
- No! I want to live my life!

308
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:56,321
What is that life, baby?
What are we part of? Who are we?

309
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:58,824
Look at this. Do you know where
these come from?

310
00:19:58,949 --> 00:20:00,993
- Yeah, my closet.
- Indonesia.

311
00:20:01,118 --> 00:20:04,329
- The store.
- Baby, this is the truth, okay?

312
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:07,416
Little girls like you,
they have to work in dark factories...

313
00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:11,253
where they go blind for $1.60 a month
just to make Mommy her pretty shoes.

314
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:14,840
- Can you imagine that, Caitlin?
- I don't want the children to work in factories!

315
00:20:14,965 --> 00:20:16,633
Don't listen, honey.
Daddy is crazy.

316
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:18,927
Daddy's not crazy, baby.
The world is crazy.

317
00:20:19,011 --> 00:20:22,139
- It's important to ask questions.
- Don't let them go blind!

318
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:25,100
Mommy doesn't ask
'cause Mommy doesn't care.

319
00:20:25,184 --> 00:20:27,644
- Don't stop asking questions, baby.
- Damn you!

320
00:20:27,728 --> 00:20:30,230
- How dare you!
- Skippy, put her in the car, will ya?

321
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:33,108
- "Less than 5% of the cosmos...
- Give me the teddy!

322
00:20:33,192 --> 00:20:36,069
Is composed of the same elements
that compose human life."

323
00:20:36,195 --> 00:20:39,489
- What does that matter?
- You should be asking these questions, Skip.

324
00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:42,784
Guys, give him a break.
His therapist is down here to help him out.

325
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:44,745
Excuse me.
What did you call me?

326
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:47,539
- You're his therapist?
- No, I'm... not his therapist.

327
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:51,168
We need to talk 'cause this book
is making a lot of sense to me and I want...

328
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:53,629
And what is Caterine Vauban
doing in the United States?

329
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:55,839
What the hell
are you talking about?

330
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:21,949
No, no, wait. This is really good.

331
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:28,580
You think that's funny?
I got a story for you.

332
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:32,626
- It's only four months old.
- Wait. Wait. Listen. Listen.
Listen to the master, all right?

333
00:21:32,751 --> 00:21:36,046
I'm with Shania. We're opening
a megastore down by the loop.

334
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:38,423
Shania's there
promoting her apparel, right?

335
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:43,136
It's 4:00 and she's starving. So I order
a ton of tuna fish sandwiches, no mayo.

336
00:21:43,262 --> 00:21:45,055
Stop it!

337
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:47,099
Tick, tick,
tick, tick, tick.

338
00:21:47,224 --> 00:21:50,686
Shania hates mayo, all right?
And she can't eat chicken salad.

339
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:55,023
That's no joke, all right? We gave it to her once,
she threw up in the limo.

340
00:21:55,107 --> 00:21:57,985
- She's vomiting all over the limo.
- The lady hates chicken salad.

341
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:01,363
So I bring out a bunch of tuna fish sandwiches.
She still doesn't believe me.

342
00:22:01,446 --> 00:22:03,949
I say, "Shania,
I'm allergic to mayo."

343
00:22:04,074 --> 00:22:08,954
- Which, by the way, is a lie.
- He loves mayo! He loves it.

344
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:13,208
Shania still doesn't believe me so I eat two
of the sandwiches in front of her to prove it.

345
00:22:13,292 --> 00:22:16,795
So she eats one and a half sandwiches.
One and a half sandwiches...

346
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,257
before she realizes...
it's chicken salad.

347
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:24,803
- And she actually likes it.
- She did not vomit.

348
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:30,559
He made her change her mind. And that's
what they want upstairs in corporate, okay?

349
00:22:33,979 --> 00:22:35,981
Excuse me? Can I help you?

350
00:22:36,106 --> 00:22:39,109
- Shh. Shh. Shh.
- Excuse me?

351
00:22:39,193 --> 00:22:42,237
Yes, I'm here for
the Open Spaces meeting with Brad Stand.

352
00:22:42,321 --> 00:22:45,240
Okay, well, then you are in the wrong
area entirely. Come on.

353
00:22:45,324 --> 00:22:48,202
- I'll show you where to go.
- You're very, very helpful. Thanks a lot.

354
00:22:48,327 --> 00:22:52,206
There's no reason for you to be up here.
This is an executive private floor.

355
00:22:52,331 --> 00:22:55,792
It's for... Come on.
Let's pick it up. Heel to toe.

356
00:22:55,876 --> 00:22:58,754
Unless you're an executive or
an executive's assistant...

357
00:22:58,837 --> 00:23:00,839
or someone who is a...

358
00:23:00,964 --> 00:23:05,385
No. No, ma'am. Shania has no song for you.
Let's move it along this way.

359
00:23:05,511 --> 00:23:08,889
You're supposed to be on another floor.
Security is very tight in this building.

360
00:23:09,014 --> 00:23:11,808
Or at least I thought it was
very tight in this building.

361
00:23:11,892 --> 00:23:14,311
Of course, every
now and then we get somebody...

362
00:23:14,394 --> 00:23:16,438
who gets off
on the wrong floor.

363
00:23:16,522 --> 00:23:18,524
And then people
flitting about...

364
00:23:18,649 --> 00:23:23,278
At Huckabees, the everything store.

365
00:23:23,362 --> 00:23:25,781
Let me try that one more time.

366
00:23:25,864 --> 00:23:27,950
L... l... Okay.

367
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:34,248
Tops and mops.
50% off all women's shirts and hair products.

368
00:23:34,373 --> 00:23:38,877
This week only.
At Huckabees, the everything store.

369
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:41,672
Uh, Dawn, can we do it one more time?

370
00:23:41,755 --> 00:23:43,715
I think we can do it better.

371
00:23:46,552 --> 00:23:49,096
- I suck, Daryl. I really sucked.
- You're doing great, Dawn.

372
00:23:49,221 --> 00:23:51,974
- I can't do this. I can't do it.
- Don't give me that face.

373
00:23:52,057 --> 00:23:54,059
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

374
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:57,437
Your voice is the trademark voice
of Huckabees.

375
00:23:57,563 --> 00:23:59,857
Oh, there she is!
You're one sneaky lady.

376
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,234
I was almost in the elevators.
We're going now.

377
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:06,572
Let's move it along. There we go.
I'll show you where you need to go.

378
00:24:10,242 --> 00:24:12,870
Moved my meeting to
the Huckabees corporation.

379
00:24:12,953 --> 00:24:15,622
I saved this rock.
I'm going to save this place.

380
00:24:15,747 --> 00:24:17,833
They're not gonna
save this place.

381
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:21,795
Rat-fucking-bastard
Brad Stand.

382
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:25,382
Corporate prick bastard.
Oh, motherfucking dickhead.

383
00:24:26,717 --> 00:24:31,597
"Betrayed"
by Albert Markovski.

384
00:24:31,722 --> 00:24:35,434
Is it possible for anybody in this world
to work together to make it better?

385
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:37,561
I don't think so.

386
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:40,898
It was Albert's vision.
This whole thing was Albert's vision.

387
00:24:40,981 --> 00:24:44,484
- Tell me about Brad.
- Albert let him in, which was a mistake.

388
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:47,362
- Fuck!
- He has been enormously helpful...

389
00:24:47,446 --> 00:24:50,908
He dropped Albert's poems
from the benefit. And the mailing.

390
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:53,785
Settle down. Someone tell me
about the woods and the marsh.

391
00:24:53,911 --> 00:24:56,788
MaryJane, this is your story.
Why don't you do it?

392
00:24:56,914 --> 00:25:01,210
My great grandfather owned
the woods and the marsh.

393
00:25:01,293 --> 00:25:05,464
We deeded them over
to the municipality in 1972.

394
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:09,134
In perpetuity for the public.

395
00:25:09,259 --> 00:25:12,471
- Tell me why.
- We just wanted to share this beautiful place.

396
00:25:12,596 --> 00:25:16,725
And now the town
is looking at subclauses.

397
00:25:16,808 --> 00:25:20,145
- All of the sudden wants yet another mall...

398
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:22,940
and houses on
this beautiful marsh.

399
00:25:23,023 --> 00:25:24,983
- So we're fighting it.
- We are fighting it.

400
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:27,986
- We have to save the marsh.
- Sorry I'm late, guys.

401
00:25:28,111 --> 00:25:31,657
I got the photo
of the wetlands right here!

402
00:25:31,782 --> 00:25:33,534
It looks beautiful!

403
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:36,787
Here's the marsh and woods
we're going to save.

404
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:39,122
This photo says
good times and peace.

405
00:25:39,206 --> 00:25:41,583
Shania's right here.
No silly poetry.

406
00:25:41,667 --> 00:25:44,628
Let the beauty speak
for itself.

407
00:25:44,711 --> 00:25:47,297
This is where
the littlejack-in-the-pulpits live.

408
00:25:47,381 --> 00:25:50,133
An image is always better.
You've gotta reach people quick.

409
00:25:50,217 --> 00:25:54,012
They don't understand poems. They don't want
to hear poems. They have no time for them.

410
00:25:54,137 --> 00:25:58,183
They think too much.
Open Spaces T's for everyone. MaryJane.

411
00:25:58,308 --> 00:26:01,603
- Extra small for your grandson, right?
- You shouldn't have.

412
00:26:01,687 --> 00:26:04,690
Open Spaces T's
and here is the schedule for the benefit.

413
00:26:04,815 --> 00:26:06,817
First up, cocktails.
Then, MaryJane...

414
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,612
you introduce the marsh video,
background story, animals, plants and stuff.

415
00:26:10,696 --> 00:26:15,325
Angela, you speak. Marty speaks
for Huckabees. I speak. Then Shania sings.

416
00:26:18,036 --> 00:26:20,873
Shania Twain entertains us.

417
00:26:20,998 --> 00:26:23,959
- Hi, have we met?
- No. Vivian Jaffe.

418
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:26,628
- Brad Stand.
- She's a perspective from...

419
00:26:26,712 --> 00:26:28,714
Albert Markovski.

420
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:31,258
- Sorry, that's not gonna work.
- What's the matter with that?

421
00:26:31,383 --> 00:26:33,719
- How are you connected?
- Through an investigation.

422
00:26:33,844 --> 00:26:37,139
I worry about that guy. He alienates people.
What kind of investigation?

423
00:26:37,222 --> 00:26:40,559
Existential. I'd like to ask a few questions
if you don't mind.

424
00:26:40,684 --> 00:26:44,563
Actually we do. We do because
we've got to meet, and we're a little late.

425
00:26:44,688 --> 00:26:47,024
Sounds kind of interesting though.
Have you got a card?

426
00:26:47,107 --> 00:26:49,026
- Yes.
- I don't mean to give you a hard time.

427
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:51,278
Existential? Is that
like a therapy?

428
00:26:51,403 --> 00:26:54,156
Okay, let's go, sneaky lady.
Let's step it outside.

429
00:26:54,239 --> 00:26:57,326
I told you to stay away
from my work situation!

430
00:26:57,409 --> 00:27:01,830
To solve your coincidence, we have to put it
into context. Brad Stand seems very important.

431
00:27:01,914 --> 00:27:05,334
So you come by Huckabees corporate and
say you're my fucking existential detectives?

432
00:27:05,417 --> 00:27:09,922
- I'm lucky if I last another day!
- We can solve your case sooner
if you're straight with us.

433
00:27:10,047 --> 00:27:12,090
I'm being straight with you.
Brad smeared me...

434
00:27:12,216 --> 00:27:14,301
and took the coalition
in a different direction.

435
00:27:14,426 --> 00:27:17,971
- That's straight.
- At Schottinger's photo archive
where you met Mr. Nimieri...

436
00:27:18,096 --> 00:27:20,140
Who's Mr... Who's that?

437
00:27:20,265 --> 00:27:23,060
- The African guy.
- That's the African guy from my coincidence.

438
00:27:23,143 --> 00:27:27,147
- This is what I wanna talk about.
- It wasn't your first time at Schottinger's, was it?

439
00:27:27,272 --> 00:27:29,608
- Did I say it was?
- You did. You agree it wasn't?

440
00:27:29,733 --> 00:27:31,985
Sure. It wasn't my first time.
Big deal.

441
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:35,906
It was more like a regular thing with you.
And you weren't finding a still of Bob Dylan.

442
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:38,492
You were planting photos
of yourself in the archive.

443
00:27:38,617 --> 00:27:43,038
- What are you getting at?
- Why would you do something like that?

444
00:27:43,121 --> 00:27:47,084
To be noticed.
Maybe urgently.

445
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:50,128
- Maybe, yeah.
- Uh-huh.

446
00:27:50,254 --> 00:27:52,798
How did that affect things
with Brad at the coalition?

447
00:27:52,923 --> 00:27:55,467
How did it affect things at
the coalition? I don't know.

448
00:27:55,592 --> 00:27:58,011
You know, it was a drag.
It really was a drag.

449
00:27:58,136 --> 00:28:01,640
Because I wanted my poems to go out
with the fund-raiser mailing. Brad didn't.

450
00:28:01,765 --> 00:28:04,059
He was all obsessed
with Shania and Pete Sampras.

451
00:28:04,142 --> 00:28:08,105
Not what we were really
supposed to be focusing on... hurt.

452
00:28:08,188 --> 00:28:13,151
You planted photos of yourself and your poems
at Schottinger's. Brad didn't respect you.

453
00:28:13,277 --> 00:28:16,613
- No, he didn't.
- And yet you brought him into
the open spaces coalition.

454
00:28:16,697 --> 00:28:20,117
- Why is that?
- I needed the sponsor to take
my cause to another level.

455
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,286
That's why.
Why else would I do it?

456
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:25,455
- Like we said. To be noticed.
- This is absurd. Show me my folder.

457
00:28:25,539 --> 00:28:29,960
- No. That is not productive.
- At the photo archive, you spent a lot of time...

458
00:28:30,043 --> 00:28:32,671
Iooking at old Jessica Lange
bathing suit stills, why?

459
00:28:32,796 --> 00:28:34,965
That's only because Lange
comes before Markovski.

460
00:28:35,048 --> 00:28:38,427
I was putting my head shots under Markovski,
and then "L" is right before it.

461
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:42,347
I might've looked at a little bit of Lange
on the way out. What's the big deal?

462
00:28:42,472 --> 00:28:46,727
- Albert, baby, come on.
- What, is it a crime? Is it a crime to look at Lange?

463
00:28:46,852 --> 00:28:49,646
- Have you ever been in love?
- What kind of question is that?

464
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:53,692
- Do you even believe in love?
- Or do you only have fantasy relationships...

465
00:28:53,817 --> 00:28:56,945
because anything else
would be too painful?

466
00:28:57,029 --> 00:28:59,281
Bernard, excuse me. But I'm
making some progress here.

467
00:28:59,364 --> 00:29:02,534
So am I, darling.
So am I.

468
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:06,038
Oh, no, no. I'm not going in that thing.
Every time I go in there...

469
00:29:06,163 --> 00:29:09,166
it's all hating faces
that I have to chop up with a machete.

470
00:29:09,249 --> 00:29:13,921
And then they multiply.
And we're going to address that right now.

471
00:29:14,046 --> 00:29:16,006
- Okay?
- I'll leave it to you.

472
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:19,968
Come on. You can't retreat.
Back into the fray, Albert. Let's go.

473
00:29:21,261 --> 00:29:24,348
I'm in your corner.

474
00:29:28,185 --> 00:29:31,730
Okay, Albert, I want you to melt
your usual identity like you did before.

475
00:29:31,855 --> 00:29:35,776
Stop looking at me.

476
00:29:35,901 --> 00:29:37,861
I said stop looking at me.

477
00:29:37,945 --> 00:29:40,823
- Dawn is gonna love doing
spots for the open spaces.
- Who's Dawn?

478
00:29:40,906 --> 00:29:43,534
Miss Huckabees.
Dawn.

479
00:29:43,617 --> 00:29:46,787
- She loves your poems. The one about the rock.
- Nobody sits like this rock sits.

480
00:29:46,912 --> 00:29:50,123
That's the one. She loves poems.
She loves forests, meadows, getting outside.

481
00:29:50,249 --> 00:29:53,794
We'll just throw theJet Skis
on the trailer and head to the mountains.

482
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:55,712
Wait, you guys...
You go with MissHuckabees?

483
00:29:55,796 --> 00:29:59,007
- She was doing some print work for us...
- Albert? Albert?

484
00:29:59,091 --> 00:30:02,803
Forget Brad. Come back to me.
Where are you? Where are you?

485
00:30:02,928 --> 00:30:07,599
Albert.
Picture a tree in a field.

486
00:30:07,724 --> 00:30:10,644
Good. Now put someone
you respect in the tree.

487
00:30:10,769 --> 00:30:13,146
- Hey, dickweed.
- Still Brad Stand.

488
00:30:13,272 --> 00:30:15,274
- Add someone else.
- Like who?

489
00:30:15,399 --> 00:30:18,110
You know, someone who can understand
things. Someone who can help you.

490
00:30:18,235 --> 00:30:23,615
- Who's your guide?
- Well, I use Magritte, a Belgian surrealist.

491
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,912
- I got someone.
- Who is it?

492
00:30:28,996 --> 00:30:32,374
Mrs. Schirmir. She was my high school
English teacher. She helped me.

493
00:30:32,457 --> 00:30:35,252
- All right, good.
- He pushed her out of the tree.

494
00:30:35,335 --> 00:30:40,132
Okay, Mrs. Schirmir has a vacuum cleaner,
Albert, that sucks up fear.

495
00:30:42,634 --> 00:30:47,723
Now she's going to send you
rays of security and complete acceptance.

496
00:30:50,809 --> 00:30:53,562
He chopped her head off!

497
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:02,029
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
You're doing well.

498
00:31:02,154 --> 00:31:04,198
Now, don't give up now.
Didn't she vacuum a lot?

499
00:31:04,323 --> 00:31:07,493
But then he vacuumed her.
I had to chop him up with a machete.

500
00:31:07,618 --> 00:31:10,454
Okay, Albert. I can let you
in on a couple of secrets.

501
00:31:10,537 --> 00:31:12,706
One, your mind is always
occupied on something...

502
00:31:12,831 --> 00:31:16,919
so it may as well be something helpful
like Mrs. Schirmir and her vacuum cleaner.

503
00:31:17,002 --> 00:31:20,923
Two, there is
no such thing as you and me.

504
00:31:21,006 --> 00:31:23,133
So then there's
just nothing?

505
00:31:23,217 --> 00:31:25,636
Three, there's
no such thing as nothing.

506
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:28,722
There is no remainder
in the mathematics of infinity.

507
00:31:28,847 --> 00:31:31,058
There's only the blanket.

508
00:31:31,183 --> 00:31:34,019
I thought I understood the blanket.
Now I'm not sure.

509
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:39,191
Flags and bags! Huckabees says,
"Happy birthday, Mr. President."

510
00:31:39,316 --> 00:31:42,861
50% off all knapsacks
and pocketbooks.

511
00:31:42,986 --> 00:31:47,157
Oh, say, can you see
how good this looks?

512
00:31:47,241 --> 00:31:49,868
Let freedom ring.
At Huckabees...

513
00:31:49,993 --> 00:31:53,121
the everything store.

514
00:31:53,205 --> 00:31:56,041
"Huckabees cornucopia
of stuff we all want.

515
00:31:56,166 --> 00:31:59,837
"But what happened to the gazelles?
Were they squashed...

516
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,964
under the CD department?"

517
00:32:02,047 --> 00:32:04,842
- Hey, Albert, how's it goin'?
- What are you doing here, Brad?

518
00:32:04,925 --> 00:32:07,052
I met Brad when
I was investigating you.

519
00:32:07,177 --> 00:32:10,430
He called with his own existential
conundrum. That's all.

520
00:32:10,556 --> 00:32:13,308
- I'm really glad I found out about these people.
- That's bullshit.

521
00:32:13,392 --> 00:32:15,394
He doesn't care about
things like this.

522
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,688
Bring me the African guy.
Where's that African guy?

523
00:32:17,771 --> 00:32:20,941
- Dude, what're you talking about?
- Why does he get to write poetry?

524
00:32:21,066 --> 00:32:23,318
There's no gazelles in North America.
Just so you know.

525
00:32:23,402 --> 00:32:26,530
And that building squashing nature
is my imagery. You don't write poetry.

526
00:32:26,613 --> 00:32:29,283
Everyone's intake procedure is different.

527
00:32:29,408 --> 00:32:31,535
I asked Brad to write a poem.

528
00:32:31,618 --> 00:32:34,204
And it wasn't enough that
you came to my coalition...

529
00:32:34,288 --> 00:32:36,707
now you have to
come here and do... Okay, okay.

530
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:40,377
All right, that's good.

531
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:44,923
We're the same, Brad.
It's all the blanket.

532
00:32:45,048 --> 00:32:47,009
There you go.
Give it a shot.

533
00:32:47,092 --> 00:32:49,970
- That is wonderful, Albert.
- Oh, honey, he's got it.

534
00:32:50,095 --> 00:32:52,347
How are things
at the coalition, Brad?

535
00:32:52,431 --> 00:32:54,933
Great. Much smoother.

536
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:58,729
Great, I look forward to coming back
and working with you.

537
00:32:58,812 --> 00:33:01,231
I don't think that's going
to happen, my friend.

538
00:33:01,315 --> 00:33:05,277
I'm still in the charter.
I built the coalition from scratch.

539
00:33:05,402 --> 00:33:08,322
Yeah. Yeah. Well, I don't want
to cramp you here.

540
00:33:08,447 --> 00:33:11,617
That's what you mean to do!
That's exactly what you mean to do!

541
00:33:11,742 --> 00:33:13,452
- What?
- What?
- What?

542
00:33:13,577 --> 00:33:16,538
You see what he's doing?
Tell them what you're doing.

543
00:33:16,622 --> 00:33:20,209
- What?
- He's come here to conquer you
like he conquered my coalition.

544
00:33:20,292 --> 00:33:24,630
And now he's here today to unnerve me so
that when Orrin comes to town, I will blow it.

545
00:33:24,755 --> 00:33:26,715
- That's what you mean to do.
- Albert, please!

546
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:29,676
- Oh, my God, Brad. You're killing me.
- What are you talking about?

547
00:33:29,801 --> 00:33:32,721
What am I talking...
Okay, when Orrin comes, I'll blow it.

548
00:33:32,804 --> 00:33:36,850
I'll get kicked out, and then he can do
whatever he wants with the coalition.

549
00:33:36,975 --> 00:33:39,770
- Who's Orrin?
- Orrin is the Open Spaces national director.

550
00:33:39,853 --> 00:33:41,897
He's coming to review
our charter.

551
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:44,942
I hope this isn't about Dawn.
He has a crush on my girlfriend.

552
00:33:45,025 --> 00:33:47,236
- That's crazy!
- Why do you stare at her?

553
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:49,238
She's a model!

554
00:33:49,321 --> 00:33:52,282
- I'm going home.
- Oh, no! Albert, please.
Stay with us for mancala hour.

555
00:33:52,366 --> 00:33:54,576
I'm gonna have a fucking ball
at mancala hour, aren't I?

556
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,662
Maybe Albert
should meet his other.

557
00:33:56,787 --> 00:33:59,248
What? Tommy? No, that's
a bad idea right now.

558
00:33:59,331 --> 00:34:03,126
Yes, a dicey move. Maybe even dangerous,
but potentially inspired.

559
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:05,629
Bernard, give them
both a connection.

560
00:34:05,712 --> 00:34:09,258
Maybe, but Tommy's in a bad direction.
It could spread to Albert.

561
00:34:09,341 --> 00:34:12,094
You said Tommy was gonna be fine.
What are you leaving out?

562
00:34:12,177 --> 00:34:16,390
Nothing. Give him his other.
It's an inspired idea. It's groovy.

563
00:34:16,515 --> 00:34:18,559
The connection will
come back to us, Bernard.

564
00:34:18,684 --> 00:34:23,105
- It all comes around. Like
you say, take the long view.
- Long view.

565
00:34:23,188 --> 00:34:27,067
- What's the other?
- We're going to find out right now. Shh.

567
00:34:30,821 --> 00:34:34,992
There was a drought.

568
00:34:35,075 --> 00:34:39,121
There was no crop.

569
00:34:39,204 --> 00:34:41,206
No olives.

570
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:45,377
No soul of life.

571
00:34:48,255 --> 00:34:50,340
No rabbit in the oven.

572
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,473
We mashed locusts
and made bread.

573
00:35:00,017 --> 00:35:02,186
I have no idea what you guys
are talking about.

574
00:35:02,269 --> 00:35:04,271
I thought we were going
to talk about petroleum.

575
00:35:04,396 --> 00:35:08,025
Mrs. Echevarria visits us
once a year from Spain.

576
00:35:08,108 --> 00:35:10,444
She's sort of a little
treat for our clients.

577
00:35:10,569 --> 00:35:12,654
A kind of
spiritual petit four.

578
00:35:12,738 --> 00:35:15,991
Something that would be useful for you
to be accustomed to.

579
00:35:16,074 --> 00:35:18,785
- Yeah, a real treat.
- You have received your answer.

580
00:35:18,911 --> 00:35:23,165
Senorita, the petroleum situation
was not created by nature...

581
00:35:23,248 --> 00:35:26,335
like the drought or
the olives or any of that.

582
00:35:26,418 --> 00:35:29,505
It was created by people,
and this is the facts.

583
00:35:29,588 --> 00:35:32,341
It was created by people who
act like nothing's happening...

584
00:35:32,424 --> 00:35:35,052
- and that's causing all the problems.
- No, no, Tommy.

585
00:35:35,135 --> 00:35:37,179
- One question only. Uno.
- Okay.

586
00:35:37,262 --> 00:35:39,389
- Here's the question...
- No, no. I think...

587
00:35:39,473 --> 00:35:43,936
You've had your question and the answer,
Tommy, please. Senora is tired.

588
00:35:44,061 --> 00:35:47,272
Senorita, why do people only ask
themselves deep questions...

589
00:35:47,397 --> 00:35:49,525
when something
really bad happens?

590
00:35:49,608 --> 00:35:51,860
Then they forget
all about it after. Right?

591
00:35:51,944 --> 00:35:53,946
How come people are
self-destructive?

592
00:35:54,071 --> 00:35:56,114
And third,
I refuse to use petroleum...

593
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,368
but there's no way I can stop its use
in my lifetime, is there?

594
00:35:59,451 --> 00:36:01,995
Jimmy Carter would have
a great electric car by now.

595
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,915
I could have a Cadillac Escalade,
and it would be electric.

596
00:36:04,998 --> 00:36:07,793
- I wouldn't have to ride on my bicycle.
- That is three questions.

597
00:36:07,918 --> 00:36:10,796
I paid my money and I want a fucking answer.
So just give me a second.

598
00:36:10,921 --> 00:36:14,341
I know, dear boy. We wanted
you to meet Albert.

599
00:36:14,466 --> 00:36:18,220
- I thought you said next week.
- It turns out he can use
a connection sooner than later.

600
00:36:18,303 --> 00:36:20,389
Tommy has been working
with us since that...

601
00:36:20,472 --> 00:36:23,600
The big September thing.
He's going to be your other.

602
00:36:23,684 --> 00:36:26,770
- What is it exactly?
- Like a buddy system I think.

603
00:36:26,854 --> 00:36:30,399
When we dismantle,
it can get kind of rough. And it helps...

604
00:36:30,482 --> 00:36:32,609
to have a friend
going through the same.

605
00:36:39,658 --> 00:36:41,618
Do you drive a car?

606
00:36:41,702 --> 00:36:43,954
A bike.
Sometimes I take the bus.

607
00:36:44,037 --> 00:36:47,708
Good. That's good. I like that.
I can see why they put us together.

608
00:36:47,833 --> 00:36:50,043
- Tommy Corn.
- Albert Markovski.

609
00:36:50,169 --> 00:36:53,213
- I'll be your other.
- Join us for mancala hour.

610
00:36:53,338 --> 00:36:57,467
- Come. Come. Gracias, senora.

611
00:37:12,524 --> 00:37:14,526
- What's happening with your case?
- I don't know.

612
00:37:14,651 --> 00:37:17,529
- What do you mean?
- They won't let me see my coincidence file.

613
00:37:17,654 --> 00:37:20,866
You want them to solve a coincidence?
That's why you came here?

614
00:37:20,991 --> 00:37:24,703
- Yeah, that's why I came here.
- Who's the girl?

615
00:37:24,828 --> 00:37:28,707
The face of Huckabees.

616
00:37:28,832 --> 00:37:31,668
- Tops and mops?
- That's her.

617
00:37:31,752 --> 00:37:34,713
- I doubt your coincidence is meaningful.
- Why?

618
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:37,716
I have a book by a French thinker
named Caterine Vauban.

619
00:37:37,841 --> 00:37:41,970
She says the same thing they say here about
dismantling your reality to see the big picture.

620
00:37:42,054 --> 00:37:45,390
- What's the difference?
- Here, they say everything's
connected in the blanket.

621
00:37:45,516 --> 00:37:49,394
Vauban says nothing's connected. It's all
random and cruel. It doesn't matter what you do.

622
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,480
That's nihilism, Tommy!

623
00:37:51,563 --> 00:37:54,399
They find it threatening.
But it is very convincing.

624
00:37:54,525 --> 00:37:57,069
You know, my ex-girl
won't let me see my daughter.

625
00:37:57,194 --> 00:37:59,488
She's brainwashing her
not to think or feel.

626
00:37:59,571 --> 00:38:01,615
- What kind of reality is that?
- Not this one.

627
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:05,118
Exactly. I think you shouldjust look
in your file if you want to.

628
00:38:05,244 --> 00:38:08,247
- How am I gonna look at my file?
- You wanna see your file?

629
00:38:08,372 --> 00:38:10,666
I'll distract them.
You slip in for it.

630
00:38:10,749 --> 00:38:12,876
Act naturally.
Here comes your boy.

631
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:16,797
Hey, you play mancala?

632
00:38:16,922 --> 00:38:19,842
Didn't know you were interested in
existential issues, Brad.

633
00:38:19,925 --> 00:38:23,887
Why? 'Cause I'm a dumb sales executive
instead of a sensitive artist like you?

634
00:38:23,971 --> 00:38:26,890
No, I just never heard you
talk about it. That's all.

635
00:38:26,974 --> 00:38:30,102
Why do you think
I joined the Open Spaces Coalition, man?

636
00:38:30,227 --> 00:38:32,855
- I thought you cared about the issues.
- I do.

637
00:38:32,938 --> 00:38:35,357
Obviously you had
a different agenda, didn't you?

638
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,486
- What books do you read?
- What books do I read?

639
00:38:39,611 --> 00:38:41,780
PhilJackson's
Sacred Hoops.

640
00:38:41,905 --> 00:38:45,325
Really. I read the galleys when it arrived
at Huckabees, and you know what?

641
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:48,287
Seriously, that book's
got some good questions. You should read it.

642
00:38:48,412 --> 00:38:51,748
Isn't it sports questions
in that book?

643
00:38:51,832 --> 00:38:56,211
No, wise ass. PhilJackson's a smart guy.
All right, come on.

644
00:38:56,295 --> 00:38:58,547
It was
an honest question, Brad.

645
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:01,884
Felt a little hostile.
I feel the same thing from him.

646
00:39:01,967 --> 00:39:04,511
- Who the hell are you?
- Who the hell are you?

647
00:39:04,636 --> 00:39:09,141
You wanna go?
Get out of here man.

648
00:39:09,266 --> 00:39:11,768
Hey, don't be a jerk, buddy.
Come on. Don't be a...

649
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:18,233
- That's funny! He pushed him!
- It is not funny!

650
00:39:18,317 --> 00:39:21,153
- Hey, he assaulted me, man. He tried to attack me.
- Hey!

651
00:39:21,278 --> 00:39:23,280
- I tried to... You're dancing with my girl.
- Yeah.

652
00:39:23,363 --> 00:39:25,324
- You wanna dance?
- No, I don't wanna dance.

653
00:39:25,449 --> 00:39:27,117
- Look at me. Come on.
- What?

654
00:39:27,201 --> 00:39:28,744
- You want to go at him, right?
- Yeah.

655
00:39:28,827 --> 00:39:32,122
No, I don't want to go.
He grabbed my girl.

656
00:39:32,206 --> 00:39:35,459
All right, you guys wanna have
a go at each other, right?

657
00:39:35,542 --> 00:39:38,587
You wanna have a go at each other.

658
00:39:40,172 --> 00:39:42,382
You want to go backwards?

659
00:39:42,508 --> 00:39:44,551
The reptiles have been
eating each other for years.

660
00:39:44,676 --> 00:39:47,387
You want to be back on all fours?
Right? Primitive?

661
00:39:47,513 --> 00:39:52,267
Come on! That's spirit you wanna
keep for the battles inside.

662
00:39:54,353 --> 00:39:56,730
- What are you doing?
- I, um...

663
00:39:56,855 --> 00:40:00,400
Bernard... The dismantling thing with the
whole... You know, all the poetry stuff...

664
00:40:00,526 --> 00:40:04,571
But I got it. It's no big deal.
Because I got it now, okay?

665
00:40:04,696 --> 00:40:08,659
Every relationship is possible,
guys. Brothers, husbands, child.

666
00:40:08,742 --> 00:40:10,828
Security breach.
He broke into his file.

667
00:40:10,911 --> 00:40:13,413
- What did you do, Albert?

668
00:40:13,539 --> 00:40:15,499
This is my investigation now!

669
00:40:15,582 --> 00:40:18,460
You think you know what you're doing?
You haven't even begun...

670
00:40:18,544 --> 00:40:21,380
to dismantle your identity
or your fear.

671
00:40:21,505 --> 00:40:24,550
Albert's gotta do what he's gotta do.
Anybody think they know better?

672
00:40:24,675 --> 00:40:27,094
- Want to take a shot?
- It's my coincidence.

673
00:40:27,219 --> 00:40:29,263
Nobody?
Yeah, nobody.

674
00:40:29,388 --> 00:40:31,515
Sorry I grabbed you.

675
00:40:31,598 --> 00:40:33,851
- Reptilian.
- Man, come on.

678
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:07,885
- Hey, is that him there?
- Yeah, that's him.

679
00:41:12,222 --> 00:41:14,308
- Hey.
- My goodness, it is you.

680
00:41:14,433 --> 00:41:17,561
Yeah, it's me Albert. How are you?
This is my friend Tommy.

681
00:41:17,644 --> 00:41:19,646
Hey. Tommy Corn.
How are you?

682
00:41:19,771 --> 00:41:23,066
- This is the fourth coincidence?
- No, I came here on purpose.

683
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:25,444
I was wondering about our coincidences
and what they mean.

684
00:41:25,569 --> 00:41:28,322
We were just wondering if we spent time,
maybe try to understand it.

685
00:41:28,447 --> 00:41:31,492
- Perhaps you can be my guests for dinner.
- That would be great, huh?

686
00:41:31,617 --> 00:41:34,536
- Yeah, that'd be great.
- Wait here. I must ask my mom.

687
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:37,289
Guys, guys!
My ball! My ball!

688
00:41:39,249 --> 00:41:42,127
Thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.

689
00:41:42,252 --> 00:41:46,548
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses...

690
00:41:46,632 --> 00:41:49,468
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

691
00:41:49,593 --> 00:41:53,180
And lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil.

692
00:41:53,305 --> 00:41:58,185
For thine is the kingdom, the power
and the glory. Forever and ever, Amen.

693
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:00,312
Amen.

694
00:42:02,314 --> 00:42:04,691
Steven, how'd you end up
working as a doorman?

695
00:42:04,817 --> 00:42:08,070
It is our immigration agreement.
We must work.

696
00:42:08,153 --> 00:42:11,365
The building supervisor hired Steven
as a member of our congregation.

697
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:15,118
- He was so skinny.
- Skeleton man from Africa. Skeleton man...

698
00:42:15,202 --> 00:42:20,290
- What did we say about that?
- I don't want to hear it again.
It'll be no Internet tonight.

699
00:42:20,374 --> 00:42:24,711
Didn't know what a can opener was.
He opened cans with a big knife like at the camp.

700
00:42:24,837 --> 00:42:28,465
There aren't lions roaming here but there were
in Sudan, and the orphan boys got chased.

701
00:42:28,549 --> 00:42:32,386
- And one time, a big alligator
bit his friend's head off.
- It was a crocodile.

702
00:42:32,511 --> 00:42:36,348
He wanted to know where all the meat
comes from since he didn't see any cows.

703
00:42:36,473 --> 00:42:38,475
Guys, that's enough!

704
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:40,769
Albert, what brought you
to the philosophical club?

705
00:42:40,853 --> 00:42:43,063
You mean
the existential detectives?

706
00:42:43,188 --> 00:42:45,607
- Sounds like a support group.
- Why can't he use a church?

707
00:42:45,691 --> 00:42:48,527
Sometimes people
have additional questions to be answered.

708
00:42:48,652 --> 00:42:50,612
- Like what?
- Well, um, for instance...

709
00:42:50,696 --> 00:42:53,448
If the forms of this world die,
which is more real...

710
00:42:53,532 --> 00:42:55,701
the me that dies
or the me that's infinite?

711
00:42:55,826 --> 00:42:59,413
Can I trust my habitual mind or do I need
to learn to look beneath those things?

712
00:42:59,538 --> 00:43:01,999
Sounds like we got
a philosopher.

713
00:43:02,082 --> 00:43:04,918
We don't have to ask those kinds
of questions, do we, Mom?

714
00:43:05,043 --> 00:43:07,087
- No, honey.
- What happened to the cat, Albert?

715
00:43:07,212 --> 00:43:10,048
H-How'd you know
about my cat?

716
00:43:10,174 --> 00:43:13,343
- The cat was killed by curiosity.
- Right. That cat.

717
00:43:13,427 --> 00:43:16,388
- What do you do?
- I'm the director of the Open Spaces Coalition.

718
00:43:16,513 --> 00:43:19,099
- We fight suburban sprawl.
- What's suburban sprawl?

719
00:43:19,224 --> 00:43:21,852
Ask Steven. He could have used a little
suburban sprawl in Sudan.

720
00:43:21,935 --> 00:43:23,896
Excuse me, Dad?

721
00:43:24,021 --> 00:43:26,773
Industry, houses, jobs,
restaurants, medicine...

722
00:43:26,899 --> 00:43:29,818
You can preserve a lot of open spaces
and have jobs for people with...

723
00:43:29,902 --> 00:43:32,362
- I beg your pardon, Albert. I wasn't finished.
- Sorry, sir.

724
00:43:32,446 --> 00:43:35,324
Clothes, videos, toys, cheeseburgers, cars,
a functioning economy.

725
00:43:35,407 --> 00:43:39,536
You can still have a functioning economy and
preserve open spaces with a little planning.

726
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:42,539
- Yeah.
- Socialism. Complete disaster.

727
00:43:42,623 --> 00:43:45,417
- Theodore Roosevelt was a socialist? And Yeats?
- Theodore Roosevelt...

728
00:43:45,542 --> 00:43:49,379
Henry David Thoreau, Robinson Jeffers,
the National Geographic Society, all socialists?

729
00:43:49,463 --> 00:43:52,424
- You're talking about socialism.
- No, I'm not. I'm talking about...

730
00:43:52,549 --> 00:43:55,052
not covering every square inch
with houses and strip malls...

731
00:43:55,135 --> 00:43:58,555
until you can't remember what happens
when you stand in a meadow at dusk.

732
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:01,141
- What happens in the meadow at dusk?
- Everything.

733
00:44:01,266 --> 00:44:03,227
- Nothing!
- Everything!

734
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:05,354
- It's beautiful.
- It's beautiful.

735
00:44:05,437 --> 00:44:07,523
I work for an electrical
engineering firm, son.

736
00:44:07,606 --> 00:44:09,817
We do a lot of commercial
and residential contracts.

737
00:44:09,942 --> 00:44:11,985
If development stops,
so does my paycheck.

738
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:15,364
Then Steven couldn't be here as our guest,
could he? So your ideas hurt Steven.

739
00:44:15,447 --> 00:44:17,616
I'm not hurting Steven.
That's an outrageous accusation.

740
00:44:17,741 --> 00:44:20,911
- Don't use that tone of voice in my house.
- I think you started that tone.

741
00:44:20,994 --> 00:44:24,623
And I think it's entirely possible for your
engineering firm to have jobs for people...

742
00:44:24,748 --> 00:44:27,292
preserve open spaces,
have contracts, do the...

743
00:44:29,628 --> 00:44:30,629
Whoa.

744
00:44:30,629 --> 00:44:31,964
Whoa.

745
00:44:32,089 --> 00:44:35,133
- What's he doing?
- Why's he closing his eyes?

746
00:44:35,259 --> 00:44:38,804
Cricket, I don't know.

747
00:44:38,929 --> 00:44:41,390
- Do you have a job, Tom?
- I'm a firefighter.

748
00:44:41,473 --> 00:44:43,684
Oh, God bless you. A hero.

749
00:44:43,809 --> 00:44:47,896
I'm not a hero. We'd all be heroes if we
quit using petroleum though.

750
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:51,150
- Excuse me?
- Say you're Christians living
byJesus' principles. Are you?

751
00:44:51,275 --> 00:44:54,570
Jesus is never mad at us if we
live with him in our hearts.

752
00:44:54,653 --> 00:44:57,656
I hate to break it to you, but he is.
He most definitely is.

753
00:44:57,781 --> 00:45:01,827
All right. That's enough. Steven, I don't know
what this is about. Why they're here...

754
00:45:01,952 --> 00:45:06,957
- Sorry, Mom. Sorry, Dad. I did not know.
- Stevo, I'm so disappointed.

755
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,917
It's all right.
Look, he's sad. He's sad.

756
00:45:09,001 --> 00:45:11,545
I'm sorry, Stevo.
My bad. You didn't know.

757
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:14,298
- You should be ashamed of yourself.
- I should be what?

758
00:45:14,381 --> 00:45:17,593
- You should be ashamed of yourself.
- Why should I be ashamed?

759
00:45:17,676 --> 00:45:19,678
- You're a hypocrite.
- I'm a what?

760
00:45:19,803 --> 00:45:22,723
You're misleading these children.
'Cause you're the destroyer, man.

761
00:45:22,848 --> 00:45:25,434
- How am I the destroyer?
- I saw that S.U. V. Out there.

762
00:45:25,517 --> 00:45:29,229
My car's the destroyer? You wanna know
how many miles per gallon I get?

763
00:45:29,354 --> 00:45:31,773
Steven, I need to ask a question.
It's why I came here.

764
00:45:31,857 --> 00:45:33,859
Why are autographs
so important to you?

765
00:45:33,984 --> 00:45:36,528
It is a pastime with this family
which they have taught me.

766
00:45:36,653 --> 00:45:39,490
- Which I can now carry on.
- It's just for fun.

767
00:45:39,573 --> 00:45:42,117
For entertainment.
No games at the table, please.

768
00:45:42,201 --> 00:45:44,369
Yes. 260. And I've reached
the omega level.

769
00:45:44,495 --> 00:45:46,538
Destroyer. Destroyer. Destroyer.

770
00:45:46,663 --> 00:45:50,459
God gave us oil! He gave it to us!
How can God's gift be bad?

771
00:45:50,542 --> 00:45:53,420
He gave you a brain too
and you messed that up pretty good...

772
00:45:53,545 --> 00:45:56,256
I want you sons of bitches
out of my house now.

773
00:45:56,381 --> 00:45:59,218
If Hitler were alive, he'd tell you
not to think about oil.

774
00:45:59,343 --> 00:46:01,887
You're the Hitler! We took a Sudanese
refugee into our home!

775
00:46:02,012 --> 00:46:04,348
You did. But how did
Sudan happen, ma'am?

776
00:46:04,431 --> 00:46:06,558
Could it possibly be related
to dictatorships...

777
00:46:06,683 --> 00:46:08,685
that we support
for some stupid reason?

778
00:46:08,769 --> 00:46:13,273
- You shut up! You get out.
- You shut up. Come on. Let's get out of here.

779
00:46:13,398 --> 00:46:17,486
- Later, Steve.
- God bless you.

780
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,741
- Wow.
- What's going on in there?

781
00:46:22,866 --> 00:46:25,702
- Crazy.
- I can't believe them.

782
00:46:25,786 --> 00:46:27,871
- Hi, guys.
- Oh, Christ.

783
00:46:27,955 --> 00:46:31,667
You guys get anything good
in there? You didn't, did you?

784
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:34,545
You hesitated over the mention of a cat.
What does that mean?

785
00:46:34,628 --> 00:46:38,048
- It means nothing. Just like my coincidence.
- Cat seemed to hit a nerve.

786
00:46:38,131 --> 00:46:41,176
Yeah, I had a cat once.
You caught me. You're amazing.

787
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:43,971
The method worked. I saw it.
It seemed to calm you down, right?

788
00:46:44,096 --> 00:46:46,223
What method?
Come on with that method.

789
00:46:46,306 --> 00:46:48,392
That's a tranquilizer
so people don't get pissed...

790
00:46:48,475 --> 00:46:51,019
about the painful,
ugly truth... you know it.

791
00:46:51,103 --> 00:46:54,148
No, Tommy. It penetrates a unified
infinity of everything.

792
00:46:54,273 --> 00:46:55,983
We're not in infinity.
We're in the suburbs.

793
00:46:56,108 --> 00:46:58,443
Infinity is everywhere.
That's what makes it infinity.

794
00:46:58,569 --> 00:47:01,196
Okay, how does this connect?
Mr. Nimieri's an orphan from Sudan...

795
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,282
who was chased by
soldiers and crocodiles.

796
00:47:03,407 --> 00:47:06,326
- How does the love glow fit into that, man?
- It's connected.

797
00:47:06,451 --> 00:47:10,164
Albert and Mr. Nimieri
share a great deal. It's just that...

798
00:47:10,289 --> 00:47:13,417
- Oh! Oh, my God.
- What's she doing here?

799
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,794
That's Caterine.

800
00:47:15,919 --> 00:47:18,463
- This is worse than I thought.
- Oh, it's much worse.

801
00:47:18,589 --> 00:47:23,051
The meeting's going down
at Huckabees right now. Let's go.

802
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:26,805
- Hey, everybody. Calm down.

803
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:28,932
The national office
recognizes the charter.

804
00:47:29,016 --> 00:47:32,311
We're here today to give
the director a chance to even the keel.

805
00:47:32,436 --> 00:47:35,314
- So just give him a break.
- Thank you, Orrin.

806
00:47:35,439 --> 00:47:38,442
- Okay, first director now. Silence.
- Excuse me.

807
00:47:38,525 --> 00:47:41,403
First, I would like to apologize
for my part of the fight...

808
00:47:41,487 --> 00:47:44,781
that I had with Brad Stand
a little while ago over the poems...

809
00:47:44,865 --> 00:47:47,201
that did not go out
with the Shania mailing.

810
00:47:47,326 --> 00:47:50,746
- Where's Brad?
- Brad. Brad. Brad. It's all Brad, Brad.

811
00:47:50,829 --> 00:47:52,831
The big benefit's
coming up with Brad...

812
00:47:52,956 --> 00:47:55,626
and Brad's running it
and it's going to go great.

813
00:47:55,709 --> 00:47:58,712
So, look, we're overlooking
our core issues.

814
00:47:58,837 --> 00:48:01,840
- Brad is not here.
- So to get us back on track...

815
00:48:01,965 --> 00:48:04,176
I have a new poem
I'd like to read.

816
00:48:04,301 --> 00:48:06,595
Point of order, please.
Apoint of order.

817
00:48:06,678 --> 00:48:10,766
I want to discuss this strategy of poems,
which are getting us nowhere.

818
00:48:10,849 --> 00:48:14,061
Excuse me, ma'am. Ma'am.
Poems are amazing, okay?

819
00:48:14,186 --> 00:48:16,522
They will help you
and your mind transform.

820
00:48:16,647 --> 00:48:18,732
Who the hell are you?

821
00:48:18,857 --> 00:48:21,235
I'm with Albert.
It will help you...

822
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,654
to transform your mind
into thinking differently.

823
00:48:23,737 --> 00:48:27,407
- You guys need this, okay? This is great.
- Where's Brad?

824
00:48:27,533 --> 00:48:29,952
This is called
"An Open Meadow."

825
00:48:30,035 --> 00:48:32,371
"An open meadow,
an open marsh in a cloudless sky.

826
00:48:32,496 --> 00:48:34,498
- Boring.
- A crane flies."

827
00:48:34,581 --> 00:48:38,043
- Oh, Brad's here!
- Look what I got you, MaryJane.

828
00:48:38,168 --> 00:48:40,295
- Oh, is that for my grandson?
- It most certainly is.

829
00:48:40,379 --> 00:48:42,673
I'm talking here.
Come on. Shit.

830
00:48:42,756 --> 00:48:44,842
You know what?
Let me just finish reading my poem...

831
00:48:44,925 --> 00:48:46,844
and then we'll review
our strategy, okay?

832
00:48:46,927 --> 00:48:49,137
- Good job, Albert.
- Can it be taped?

833
00:48:49,221 --> 00:48:52,140
Excuse me, Brad. I would like to finish
reading my poem, please. Thank you.

834
00:48:52,224 --> 00:48:55,227
- Relax. Not doing your poem.
- Don't give me the relax thing, Brad.

835
00:48:55,352 --> 00:48:58,230
Let him read the poem, man.
He was in the middle of it.

836
00:48:58,355 --> 00:49:02,526
That man is not in our coalition. He has
no right to be here and no right to speak.

837
00:49:02,609 --> 00:49:05,654
No, ma'am, I'm not a member,
but I am a local firefighter.

838
00:49:05,737 --> 00:49:08,407
He's a great firefighter
and exactly who we want on our side.

839
00:49:08,532 --> 00:49:11,243
I don't know who these men are.
They're not members of our coalition.

840
00:49:11,368 --> 00:49:15,372
They're working on the benefit.
They're bringing a lot of support for our cause.

841
00:49:15,455 --> 00:49:17,374
- Conflict is an illusion.
- Shut up, Brad.

842
00:49:17,457 --> 00:49:19,877
Hey, Albert, that's not
the way a director behaves.

843
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:24,047
Why are you guys wasting all
your time fighting each other?

844
00:49:24,131 --> 00:49:28,177
I mean, come on. Serious.
Put the egos aside for a second, guys, please.

845
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:32,264
Deal with this issues, okay. We have a deadly
petroleum situation, not to mention...

846
00:49:32,389 --> 00:49:35,809
- Shut up! Shut...

847
00:49:35,934 --> 00:49:39,813
- Cystic Fibrosis. Civil war in Africa.

848
00:49:39,938 --> 00:49:43,650
Toxic fish. You have children
in your own community going to prison.

849
00:49:43,775 --> 00:49:46,570
Father Flavin doesn't have
the money to help them.

850
00:49:46,653 --> 00:49:48,822
Ma'am, listen to me.

851
00:49:48,947 --> 00:49:51,408
This is exactly the unfocused,
idealistic approach...

852
00:49:51,492 --> 00:49:54,995
- by Mr. Markovski that's killing us dead.

853
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:58,373
Killing us dead.
Our mission has nothing to do...

854
00:49:58,457 --> 00:50:00,792
with this nut's
petroleum fixation.

855
00:50:00,918 --> 00:50:03,170
- What did you just call me?
- Cystic toxic what?

856
00:50:03,295 --> 00:50:06,548
America wants to drive cars, right?
I have a B.M.W. S.U.V.

857
00:50:06,632 --> 00:50:09,760
And I like driving it.
I'm sorry.

858
00:50:13,013 --> 00:50:15,390
Excuse me. You got to give me
a chance, all right?

859
00:50:15,474 --> 00:50:18,018
- This is my meeting. I'm the director.
- We gave you a chance.

860
00:50:18,143 --> 00:50:21,730
- You're out of the charter.
- He can't be out of the charter. He is the charter.

861
00:50:21,814 --> 00:50:25,609
- I wrote it.
- Marty, call security. I think you should call...

862
00:50:25,692 --> 00:50:28,237
- I move to vote.
- Second!

863
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:31,448
All in favor of Brad becoming
the new leader of the coalition, say aye.

864
00:50:31,532 --> 00:50:33,534
- Aye!
- Hey, come on.

865
00:50:33,659 --> 00:50:36,286
- That's bullshit.
- Congratulations.

866
00:50:38,163 --> 00:50:41,208
Be strong. Be strong 'cause
you're going to be back.

867
00:50:41,333 --> 00:50:44,503
Don't worry about those people.
They don't appreciate you.

868
00:50:44,628 --> 00:50:48,257
Albert, what happened
in there is reality.

869
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:52,719
It's cruelty and it's chaos. The detectives
are wrong. What were you trying to do?

870
00:50:52,845 --> 00:50:56,265
You were trying to do a good thing, right?
Well, look what happened.

871
00:50:56,348 --> 00:50:59,268
I'm going to the other side, Albert.
I seriously suggest...

872
00:50:59,351 --> 00:51:04,064
you consider coming with me...
as my other.

873
00:51:04,189 --> 00:51:06,275
- Albert...
- You're wrong!

874
00:51:06,358 --> 00:51:10,445
- You're full of shit. You guys
got nothing to offer, man.
- Tommy, no...

875
00:51:10,529 --> 00:51:12,698
- This is the money right now. Yes?
- No!

876
00:51:12,823 --> 00:51:17,202
You know how hurt you feel?
This is the perfect opportunity to dismantle now.

877
00:51:17,327 --> 00:51:21,206
- Stay away from me!
- Stop! Look! Listen! Throughout infinity...

878
00:51:21,331 --> 00:51:23,917
your energy recycles
into every possible relation...

879
00:51:24,042 --> 00:51:27,004
to everyone else's energy,
even Brad's.

880
00:51:27,087 --> 00:51:28,964
You've been predator
and prey with him.

881
00:51:29,047 --> 00:51:33,093
Friends, enemies, brother,
sister, mother, child.

882
00:51:33,218 --> 00:51:35,387
I give and I give
and I give...

883
00:51:35,512 --> 00:51:38,015
and he takes and he
takes and he takes.

884
00:51:39,433 --> 00:51:42,978
- Mama.
- All right, baby. All right.

885
00:51:43,061 --> 00:51:45,772
- Yahhh!
- It's a romantic fantasy.

886
00:51:45,898 --> 00:51:48,066
And you left that
part out, okay?

887
00:51:48,192 --> 00:51:50,777
When you were taking
my cash. I want it back.

888
00:51:50,903 --> 00:51:53,947
Yeah, and if I wasn't pro bono,
I'd want my money back too.

889
00:51:54,072 --> 00:51:57,075
Send it to
my ex for my kids.

890
00:51:57,201 --> 00:52:00,662
- Hey, sign your bike out. Sign your bike out!
- Tommy, come on!

891
00:52:00,746 --> 00:52:02,915
Go! I'll block for you.

892
00:52:26,939 --> 00:52:30,567
Cocksucker! Motherfucking
bitch ass motherfucking cocksucker!

893
00:52:30,651 --> 00:52:34,613
You're all a bunch
of big babies!

894
00:52:34,738 --> 00:52:38,492
Maybe I should just quit.
I mean, what's the point of life anyway?

895
00:52:38,617 --> 00:52:41,453
I can answer
these questions for you.

896
00:52:41,578 --> 00:52:45,082
You can? Because I don't think
the other guys are doing such a hot job.

897
00:52:46,625 --> 00:52:48,752
Believe me, I can.

898
00:53:07,354 --> 00:53:09,648
You're the writer
Tommy's into?

899
00:53:09,773 --> 00:53:12,359
Are you unhappy
with their work?

900
00:53:12,484 --> 00:53:15,279
Yeah, I'm ready to
cross over to your side.

901
00:53:15,362 --> 00:53:18,866
- Tell me about your case.
- Well, you seem to be following me pretty closely.

902
00:53:18,991 --> 00:53:21,702
- Why don't you tell me about it?
- You are miserable.

903
00:53:21,827 --> 00:53:24,204
Obsessed with
your strange coincidence.

904
00:53:24,329 --> 00:53:28,625
Yeah. Yeah, but they just want
to talk about Brad Stand.

905
00:53:28,709 --> 00:53:31,461
They betrayed you,
as he did.

906
00:53:31,545 --> 00:53:34,548
- That's right.
- Betrayal embodies the universal truth you seek.

907
00:53:34,673 --> 00:53:36,675
What truth?

908
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:40,470
Cruelty, manipulation...

909
00:53:40,554 --> 00:53:43,307
meaninglessness.

910
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:45,475
Yeah.

911
00:53:54,485 --> 00:53:57,029
- Did they follow you?
- No. I lost them on Route 4.

912
00:53:57,154 --> 00:53:59,823
- Thanks for helping me out back there.
- No problem.

913
00:53:59,907 --> 00:54:04,453
Glad you're here, Albert.
This is the place to be.

914
00:54:04,536 --> 00:54:07,664
Once you realize the universe sucks,
you got nothing to lose.

915
00:54:07,748 --> 00:54:11,543
- That's what gives you la force.
- The force?

916
00:54:11,668 --> 00:54:15,881
- La force. It's French for strength.
- La force.

917
00:54:16,006 --> 00:54:18,342
You guys got
a method here?

918
00:54:18,425 --> 00:54:21,094
Yeah. Deconstruct your mind
to the blackness, okay?

919
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:23,889
Just accept it
for what it is. Nothing.

920
00:54:24,014 --> 00:54:27,935
There's no glowing guys, no infinite mothers.
None of that bullshit.

921
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:30,103
My coincidence is
meaningless, isn't it?

922
00:54:30,229 --> 00:54:32,606
Think, Albert. Have
you betrayed yourself?

923
00:54:32,731 --> 00:54:35,108
Wait a second.
What are we doing here?

924
00:54:35,234 --> 00:54:38,987
- I don't want to go to this building. Stop!
- Trust her, Albert.

925
00:54:44,785 --> 00:54:47,496
- This is for you.
- Oh, thank you.

926
00:54:50,415 --> 00:54:53,836
- Hey, hey, hey. What did she give you?
- No, stay away from me.

927
00:54:53,919 --> 00:54:57,214
- I don't want to talk to you.
- Thanks, Steven.

928
00:55:02,427 --> 00:55:04,847
- Well, this is a rare occasion.
- Where is she?

929
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:06,932
- Who?
- Caterine.

930
00:55:07,057 --> 00:55:09,893
- Who's Caterine?
- The woman who's spying on me. Where is she?

931
00:55:09,977 --> 00:55:11,979
I don't think
this is funny.

932
00:55:12,104 --> 00:55:14,648
Oh, God, here we go again.
What's happening?

933
00:55:14,773 --> 00:55:16,775
He's just making
a joke on me.

934
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:18,861
- Are you making fun of your mother?
- No.

935
00:55:18,944 --> 00:55:21,071
Why can't you
get along with her?

936
00:55:21,155 --> 00:55:23,615
- So, how's your poetry job?
- I got fired from it.

937
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:25,784
Oh, couldn't even
hold down a poetry job.

938
00:55:25,909 --> 00:55:29,163
- Brenda, what the hell did you do?
- I didn't touch it.

939
00:55:29,288 --> 00:55:33,625
Bullshit! I have this programmed
on my favorite stations on a timer.

940
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:35,836
Can I please have some time
with my son?

941
00:55:35,961 --> 00:55:38,922
I want to show him an article I have here
on marketing internship. You see this?

942
00:55:39,006 --> 00:55:41,550
- That's great, Mom. It's right up my alley.
- But it is. It's a new hot...

943
00:55:41,633 --> 00:55:44,761
- I sent this to you. Why don't
you ever listen to me...
- Have you seen this system?

944
00:55:44,845 --> 00:55:47,681
State of the art.
We got speakers all through the house.

945
00:55:47,806 --> 00:55:49,766
- But listen to this.

946
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:58,400
- It'll be easier to talk now.

947
00:55:58,484 --> 00:56:00,694
- Where did she come from?
- What's going on?

948
00:56:00,819 --> 00:56:03,238
- See, I wasn't making a joke.
- What's her name?

949
00:56:03,322 --> 00:56:07,075
I would like to discuss
some curious findings.

950
00:56:07,159 --> 00:56:10,913
- Who is this lady?
- I found here in your apartment...

951
00:56:10,996 --> 00:56:14,416
a rather troubling
piece of evidence.

952
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:17,544
- What evidence?
- Do you recognize the
handwriting, Mr. Markovski...

953
00:56:17,669 --> 00:56:20,422
- excuse me, Mr. Silver?
- This is silly. Let's go.

954
00:56:20,506 --> 00:56:23,258
No.

955
00:56:23,342 --> 00:56:25,969
- I wanna go.
- Could you please read the date for me?

956
00:56:26,053 --> 00:56:30,265
"November 17, 1989."
Albert was nine. This is his journal.

957
00:56:30,349 --> 00:56:32,559
Would you mind
reading this out loud?

958
00:56:32,684 --> 00:56:34,645
- No.
- Please.

959
00:56:34,728 --> 00:56:37,564
This stuff doesn't matter.
Let's go.

960
00:56:37,689 --> 00:56:39,650
Oh, my God.

961
00:56:43,403 --> 00:56:47,658
"I came home from school.
Mom was in the kitchen with a strange lady.

962
00:56:47,741 --> 00:56:51,286
"Mom told me to go back to my room.
I thought I was in trouble.

963
00:56:51,370 --> 00:56:55,290
"She closed my door and said,
'Purree got hit by a car and killed.'

964
00:56:55,374 --> 00:56:57,376
"And then she took me back
to the lady in the kitchen...

965
00:56:57,501 --> 00:57:00,671
"and told me to spell words
to show how I'm a good speller.

966
00:57:00,754 --> 00:57:02,923
"I said I had to go
to the bathroom.

967
00:57:03,048 --> 00:57:05,968
"I climbed out the window.
I went down the block.

968
00:57:06,051 --> 00:57:09,471
"I saw Barney playing punch ball.
He said I look sad.

969
00:57:09,555 --> 00:57:12,516
"I told him what happened to my cat.
He said, 'That's sad.'

970
00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:16,436
"Then I cried, but I tried not to show.
Some of the kids laughed.

971
00:57:16,562 --> 00:57:20,774
Barney said he cried when his dog died.
And the kids stopped laughing."

972
00:57:20,899 --> 00:57:23,485
His cat died. He was sad.
What's your point?

973
00:57:23,569 --> 00:57:26,280
- Nothing strikes you as odd?
- See? It's nothing. Let's go.

974
00:57:26,405 --> 00:57:29,032
These things happen.

975
00:57:29,116 --> 00:57:31,451
Oui. C'est vrai.
The universe is cruel.

976
00:57:31,577 --> 00:57:36,165
But tell me this, Mrs. Silver, this lady
you gave the coffee to...

977
00:57:36,248 --> 00:57:39,418
Was Helen's sister. I don't remember her name.
I met her the once.

978
00:57:39,543 --> 00:57:41,753
Was there some painful thing
about this stranger...

979
00:57:41,879 --> 00:57:44,006
that required
your immediate attention?

980
00:57:44,089 --> 00:57:48,594
No. Helen wasn't home,
so I offered her sister a cup of coffee.

981
00:57:48,719 --> 00:57:51,346
But you agree that Purree
meant a great deal to Albert?

982
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:53,891
You can't make a federal case out of the cat.

983
00:57:53,974 --> 00:57:56,143
Answer the question, please.

984
00:57:56,268 --> 00:57:59,521
I don't know much about the cat.
I traveled a lot for work.

985
00:57:59,605 --> 00:58:02,149
We're not talking about this anymore.
It's embarrassing me.

986
00:58:02,274 --> 00:58:04,526
- Precisely the point.
- What?

987
00:58:04,610 --> 00:58:08,155
You were embarrassed for feeling sad
about the death of your cat.

988
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:11,241
It's painful enough
to feel sad, but on top of it...

989
00:58:11,325 --> 00:58:13,619
to feel embarrassed for feeling,
that is the killer.

990
00:58:13,744 --> 00:58:16,747
How is that my fault?
I didn't tell him to be embarrassed.

991
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:20,167
But you did. It was more important
to have a cup of coffee...

992
00:58:20,292 --> 00:58:23,170
with a perfect stranger
than to talk to Albert...

993
00:58:23,295 --> 00:58:26,798
- about what for a small boy is a large tragedy.
- This is ridiculous.

994
00:58:26,924 --> 00:58:30,427
He climbed out his window,
a criminal in his own house.

995
00:58:30,511 --> 00:58:32,513
- Why?
- I don't know.

996
00:58:32,638 --> 00:58:33,555
- I think you do.
- I don't.

997
00:58:33,639 --> 00:58:35,349
- Yes, you do.
- Oh, stop it!

998
00:58:35,474 --> 00:58:37,601
- I think you should go.
- No, I will not go.

999
00:58:37,684 --> 00:58:40,521
Albert has a place here,
a place you have denied.

1000
00:58:40,646 --> 00:58:43,565
This is my home.
I can tell him what I want.

1001
00:58:43,649 --> 00:58:48,403
- Yes, your home is a lie.
- What does that mean? I gave
my life to this selfish bas...

1002
00:58:48,487 --> 00:58:50,531
So he could be
an ornament to you, not a person.

1003
00:58:50,656 --> 00:58:52,616
God, what are you, a bitch?

1004
00:58:52,699 --> 00:58:54,701
You're a bitch.
How many kids do you have, bitch?

1005
00:58:54,827 --> 00:58:57,913
Listen. Listen.
This is your mother.

1006
00:59:08,507 --> 00:59:12,469
- You asked me to come up here?
- What does the doorman have to do with this?

1007
00:59:15,389 --> 00:59:19,226
He was orphaned by civil war.
You were orphaned by indifference.

1008
00:59:19,351 --> 00:59:22,104
This is but one part of your puzzle.
Do you see?

1010
00:59:26,692 --> 00:59:30,487
Oh, now the timer's
all fucked up. Brenda!

1011
00:59:30,571 --> 00:59:32,823
Gee, is it that hard?
Go ahead and do it.

1012
00:59:32,906 --> 00:59:36,160
- All I'm gonna do is listen...
- I spent what? I spent $2,000 on this?

1013
00:59:36,243 --> 00:59:37,744
I wanna listen
to a radio!

1014
00:59:37,744 --> 00:59:38,787
I wanna listen
to a radio!

1015
01:00:04,521 --> 01:00:08,192
Thanks. We'll meet you later
by the rock.

1016
01:00:12,571 --> 01:00:15,991
I'm sorry, man. I need, like, a minute
to figure this out.

1017
01:00:16,074 --> 01:00:19,411
- She had to get you to see.
- See what?

1018
01:00:19,536 --> 01:00:22,289
You were trained
to betray yourself right here.

1019
01:00:22,414 --> 01:00:26,126
That's why you betrayed
yourself by going to Brad.

1020
01:00:26,251 --> 01:00:29,254
Why didn't you figure this out?
Why didn't you bring me here?

1021
01:00:29,379 --> 01:00:32,341
Because you lied to us.
You told us that the African guy...

1022
01:00:32,424 --> 01:00:35,802
was the... the doorman at your friend's building,
not at your parents' building.

1023
01:00:35,928 --> 01:00:38,847
You encrypted the truth.
That's how good you are at betraying yourself.

1024
01:00:38,931 --> 01:00:42,392
- Right.
- I told you that he wasn't ready for infinity.

1025
01:00:42,476 --> 01:00:45,187
- Don't start with that
magic blanket bullshit, okay?
- It's not magic.

1026
01:00:45,270 --> 01:00:48,690
It's just the way things are. You and me
and the air are actually tiny particles...

1027
01:00:48,774 --> 01:00:50,776
that are swirling
around together.

1028
01:00:50,901 --> 01:00:54,071
- Look right here. You see?
- Okay. But look at the cracks...

1029
01:00:54,154 --> 01:00:58,283
between these particles and the cracks
we fall through, the holes of nothingness.

1030
01:00:58,408 --> 01:01:02,120
- Exactly. Because that's what
I just experienced upstairs.
- Look closer.

1031
01:01:02,246 --> 01:01:04,665
There are tiny particles
connecting the larger cubes.

1032
01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:06,959
Yeah, and then tinier cracks
between the connections.

1033
01:01:07,084 --> 01:01:10,295
- And even tinier connections.
- And even tinier cracks.

1034
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:14,466
Yeah, but if you look close enough,
you can't tell where my nose ends...

1035
01:01:14,591 --> 01:01:17,594
and space begins,
because they're unified.

1036
01:01:17,678 --> 01:01:20,514
- See?
- So what? You can't see any of this anyway!

1037
01:01:20,639 --> 01:01:22,599
- Do you see anything?
- No.

1038
01:01:22,683 --> 01:01:24,893
But I want to debate
this particle cube thing.

1039
01:01:24,977 --> 01:01:28,897
You live all the time with things you can't see.
You can't see electricity, can you?

1040
01:01:28,981 --> 01:01:31,525
- You can't see radio waves, but you accept them.
- Trust.

1041
01:01:31,650 --> 01:01:33,986
- Fuck trust!
- You better stay away from Caterine, Albert...

1042
01:01:34,111 --> 01:01:36,071
'cause she's gonna lead you
down the path of darkness.

1043
01:01:36,155 --> 01:01:38,574
She was our prize graduate
student till she went astray.

1044
01:01:38,657 --> 01:01:41,660
I think that I am gonna stay with her,
the cracks, the pain, the nothingness...

1045
01:01:41,785 --> 01:01:43,745
because that's more real to me,
that's what I feel.

1046
01:01:43,829 --> 01:01:45,831
- Word.
- Okay. We're not sweatin' it.

1047
01:01:45,956 --> 01:01:48,584
- No, we're gonna work with Brad.
- It'll all come back to you...

1048
01:01:48,667 --> 01:01:51,128
- and interconnection.
- Brad? Are you kidding me?

1049
01:01:51,211 --> 01:01:54,798
I'm gonna work on that prick, and it's all gonna
come back to pain and no connection!

1050
01:01:54,882 --> 01:01:56,884
- No.
- It's on.

1051
01:01:57,009 --> 01:01:59,386
- We'll see.

1052
01:01:59,511 --> 01:02:01,513
We'll see.

1053
01:02:07,853 --> 01:02:09,855
Ooh, damn.

1054
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:12,274
Come on.

1055
01:02:18,363 --> 01:02:20,324
Oh, shit. Fuck.

1056
01:02:33,879 --> 01:02:36,507
Oh, look at this. Kafka.

1057
01:02:40,177 --> 01:02:42,554
- He's planting garbage for us.
- Kafka.

1058
01:02:42,679 --> 01:02:45,015
- Kafka.
- Look at that. So fishy.

1059
01:02:45,098 --> 01:02:48,727
Ooh, she found his poem.

1060
01:02:48,852 --> 01:02:52,356
Oh, this is good.
I was hoping for a break like this.

1061
01:02:52,439 --> 01:02:54,441
- Don't go in my den.
- Whoa. Whoa.

1062
01:02:54,566 --> 01:02:56,527
- I'm not unhappy to be with you!
- Let me see this!

1063
01:02:56,610 --> 01:02:58,445
"Putting on a show.
Can't say no.

1064
01:02:58,570 --> 01:03:00,531
Inside I'm drowning,
sighing and frowning."

1065
01:03:00,614 --> 01:03:03,408
That doesn't sound very happy to me.
Does it sound very happy to you?

1066
01:03:03,534 --> 01:03:06,078
I only wrote "frowning"
to rhyme with "drowning."

1067
01:03:06,203 --> 01:03:08,372
- Then why did you need "drowning"?
- To rhyme with "frowning."

1068
01:03:08,455 --> 01:03:10,624
- There... There's nothing in it.
- What does that mean? Look!

1069
01:03:10,749 --> 01:03:14,336
And why do they have to go through our yard
and go through the garbage?

1070
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:19,758
- What is he doing? Stop that.

1071
01:03:19,883 --> 01:03:21,969
Why is he sniffing my blouse?

1072
01:03:22,094 --> 01:03:24,972
Perspiration levels indicate stress,
and that's kind of high.

1073
01:03:25,097 --> 01:03:27,724
Brad signed a rather comprehensive contract...

1074
01:03:27,808 --> 01:03:29,893
allowing unfettered access
to your home.

1075
01:03:29,977 --> 01:03:32,229
Well, it's my home too,
and I didn't sign anything.

1076
01:03:32,312 --> 01:03:34,940
You're going to have to
work that out with Brad.

1077
01:03:35,065 --> 01:03:37,734
The mortgage is in his name,
and you're not married.

1078
01:03:37,818 --> 01:03:40,070
- Are these from this year?

1079
01:03:40,154 --> 01:03:42,156
Last year.
We went to Saint Bart's.

1080
01:03:42,281 --> 01:03:44,449
- What about this year?
- We didn't take a trip this year.

1081
01:03:44,575 --> 01:03:46,535
- How come?
- Too busy. A lot of work.

1082
01:03:46,618 --> 01:03:50,205
- Too busy to go have fun?
- Hon... Honey, why are you involved with this?

1083
01:03:50,289 --> 01:03:53,125
- You don't believe in therapy.
- No, see, I don't see this as therapy.

1084
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:55,335
I'm proactive.
These people are action oriented.

1085
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:58,088
It's like the company retreats
at Hilton Head. Remember?

1086
01:03:58,172 --> 01:04:01,341
- No, hey. Get out of there. Hey! Hey!
- No. Now, unfettered access.

1087
01:04:01,466 --> 01:04:04,511
- Remember last year, the trust
thing? The paragliding?
- A quick look at your label.

1088
01:04:04,636 --> 01:04:06,972
- It's just like that.
- No, it's not like that! This is...

1089
01:04:07,097 --> 01:04:09,933
Actually it is. No, it is.
Everything will end up nice.

1090
01:04:10,017 --> 01:04:12,561
It seemed like they were helping Albert.
They can help me.

1091
01:04:12,644 --> 01:04:14,646
Help the Open Spaces.
Help Huckabees.

1092
01:04:14,771 --> 01:04:17,983
- What are you talking about?
- He did mention that in his application...

1093
01:04:18,108 --> 01:04:21,528
that he felt exhausted from having
to constantly charm everyone...

1094
01:04:21,653 --> 01:04:24,406
but doesn't see
any alternative because...

1095
01:04:24,490 --> 01:04:28,243
"You need to get people to like you to be
successful to get things done in this world."

1096
01:04:28,327 --> 01:04:31,538
- End quote.
- Duh. Brad likes to be charming.
It comes naturally.

1097
01:04:31,663 --> 01:04:33,832
I only put those things
in the garbage as a joke.

1098
01:04:33,957 --> 01:04:36,877
- Yeah, see? That's funny.
- Back door way to charm.

1099
01:04:37,002 --> 01:04:39,087
That's joking as
a disguised request for approval.

1100
01:04:39,171 --> 01:04:41,465
That's saying, "Joke,"
but really love me.

1101
01:04:41,548 --> 01:04:44,676
- Joke, love me.
- Ms. Campbell, how have
you felt about being pretty?

1102
01:04:44,801 --> 01:04:48,430
- Oh, please. I don't think
of myself as being that pretty.

1103
01:04:48,514 --> 01:04:51,433
Yes, that's changed
at Huckabees, but, you know...

1104
01:04:51,517 --> 01:04:53,519
I was never the pretty girl.

1105
01:04:53,644 --> 01:04:55,437
- Really?
- No.

1106
01:04:55,521 --> 01:04:58,482
I just have to keep up
with this gorgeous hottie.

1107
01:04:58,565 --> 01:05:00,609
- How's the sex?
- How is the sex?

1108
01:05:00,692 --> 01:05:04,780
- The sex?
- Come on, guys. Come on. That's private.

1109
01:05:04,863 --> 01:05:06,865
- That's gross.
- A preliminary surveillance...

1110
01:05:06,990 --> 01:05:10,619
indicates it's been infrequent and short...
eight to nine minutes...

1111
01:05:10,702 --> 01:05:13,038
- typically.
- Surveillance? You watched us?

1112
01:05:13,163 --> 01:05:15,499
- No, just listened.
- So, your surveillance is wrong.

1113
01:05:15,582 --> 01:05:18,585
Yeah. It's quantity,
not quality.

1114
01:05:18,710 --> 01:05:22,130
- What?
- She meant quality, not quantity.

1115
01:05:22,214 --> 01:05:24,967
- I know. I was onlyjoking.
- Were you joking...

1116
01:05:25,050 --> 01:05:28,095
- when you said quantity and not quality?
- In regards to sex?

1117
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:30,305
- We're not gonna discuss this.
- We're private about...

1118
01:05:30,389 --> 01:05:32,599
- our seven minutes of heaven.
- It's longer than that.

1119
01:05:32,724 --> 01:05:34,935
Eight minutes of heaven!
It's not quality, it's quantity!

1120
01:05:37,521 --> 01:05:40,858
- You oughta see her after a couple margaritas.
- Oh, my God! I'm crying.

1121
01:05:42,234 --> 01:05:44,444
- Honey...
- What is it?

1122
01:05:44,570 --> 01:05:48,073
Why did you have to write this poem? How
come we can't discuss these things ourselves?

1123
01:05:48,198 --> 01:05:51,034
Where is
this relationship going, huh?

1124
01:05:51,118 --> 01:05:54,121
Why is marriage and kids so important?
There's an overpopulation problem.

1125
01:05:54,246 --> 01:05:56,206
- Whoa.

1126
01:05:56,290 --> 01:05:58,667
- That came out of left field.
- All right.

1127
01:05:58,750 --> 01:06:03,088
Why is having children the ultimate
performance for successful people? Why?

1128
01:06:03,213 --> 01:06:05,966
Well, it doesn't have
to be a performance.

1129
01:06:06,091 --> 01:06:08,343
You know, we don't
have to have kids.

1130
01:06:08,427 --> 01:06:11,305
We could just, you know,
think about it, or not.

1131
01:06:11,430 --> 01:06:14,433
Could just be ourselves,
Jet Skiing, whatever.

1132
01:06:14,558 --> 01:06:16,518
This is not why
I hired you.

1133
01:06:16,602 --> 01:06:19,605
Then why did you
hire them?

1134
01:06:21,773 --> 01:06:23,734
Well, I have a meeting.

1135
01:06:23,817 --> 01:06:25,944
Oh. There it is.

1136
01:06:34,411 --> 01:06:37,456
- Would you like some tea?
- With a little lemon.

1137
01:06:42,002 --> 01:06:46,131
So, I've never really done
anything like this before.

1138
01:06:46,256 --> 01:06:49,760
Um, where...
where would we start?

1139
01:07:02,272 --> 01:07:04,650
Now. Now.

1140
01:07:10,697 --> 01:07:13,116
- Did you get it?
- Yeah.

1141
01:07:14,993 --> 01:07:17,371
I did. I felt it.

1142
01:07:17,496 --> 01:07:20,249
It's hard to describe.

1143
01:07:20,332 --> 01:07:23,001
Very, very good.
Your turn.

1144
01:07:24,670 --> 01:07:27,923
Now.

1145
01:07:28,006 --> 01:07:30,008
- Not so hard.
- Sorry.

1146
01:07:33,637 --> 01:07:36,974
Now. Now. Now.

1147
01:07:37,057 --> 01:07:39,017
Now!

1148
01:07:43,981 --> 01:07:46,400
Did you get it?

1149
01:07:46,525 --> 01:07:48,485
Yeah, you stop thinking.

1150
01:07:52,156 --> 01:07:55,409
Yes.
It's fantastic.

1151
01:07:55,534 --> 01:07:58,245
It's like I'm here,
but I'm not...

1152
01:07:58,370 --> 01:08:00,956
So, I'm not here.
It-It's just...

1153
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:03,292
l... l... I don't know.
Do it one more time.

1154
01:08:08,881 --> 01:08:12,342
It's like I'm a rock
or a dish of mold.

1155
01:08:12,426 --> 01:08:16,054
I'm whatever else is around.
So I'm free to just exist.

1156
01:08:16,180 --> 01:08:19,016
This is the answer.
We just have to be this all day, every day.

1157
01:08:19,099 --> 01:08:21,560
- That's the answer.
- Yes.

1158
01:08:21,685 --> 01:08:24,188
- Do it again. Do it again.
- Now.

1159
01:08:29,401 --> 01:08:31,862
Careful, my young students...

1160
01:08:31,945 --> 01:08:33,947
you cannot stay
in this state all day.

1161
01:08:34,072 --> 01:08:36,033
- Why not?
- Yeah, why not?

1162
01:08:36,116 --> 01:08:39,036
It is inevitable that you are
drawn back into human drama.

1163
01:08:39,119 --> 01:08:41,830
Desire, suffering... everything that exists
in this imperfect world.

1164
01:08:41,914 --> 01:08:45,792
- Shit.
- So we get drawn back into human drama...

1165
01:08:45,918 --> 01:08:47,878
and how important
we think that is.

1166
01:08:47,961 --> 01:08:50,547
Then we do crazy stuff.
We have to go back to the ball...

1167
01:08:50,631 --> 01:08:54,134
so we can get the freedom
of being like a... like a dish of mold.

1168
01:08:54,259 --> 01:08:56,553
Yes. And then back
to the drama, the suffering.

1169
01:08:56,637 --> 01:09:00,390
- It's kind of a crappy deal.
- C'est exactement a.

1170
01:09:00,474 --> 01:09:02,935
An absurd theatrical
we must play out, back and forth...

1171
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:05,479
from pure being
to human suffering.

1172
01:09:05,604 --> 01:09:08,732
But isn't the drama and suffering less
if we do the ball thing every day?

1173
01:09:08,816 --> 01:09:12,236
Don't call it "the ball thing."
Call it "pure being."

1174
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:15,113
Doesn't the pure being, ball thing
make the day-to-day suffering easier?

1175
01:09:15,239 --> 01:09:16,949
- Yeah.
- No, it doesn't.

1176
01:09:17,074 --> 01:09:19,409
You're wrong. We're gonna
do this every day.

1177
01:09:19,493 --> 01:09:23,497
- We'll show you. It'll make it easier.
- I'll prove it to you.

1178
01:09:23,622 --> 01:09:25,666
Human drama
is inevitable.

1179
01:09:25,791 --> 01:09:28,168
Suffering cannot be diminished.
You cannot escape, Tommy.

1180
01:09:28,293 --> 01:09:30,712
You'll see.
Existence is a cruel joke...

1181
01:09:30,796 --> 01:09:32,798
that entices in a form
of desire.

1182
01:09:32,923 --> 01:09:36,802
- Absurd theater of desire.
- I know, buddy, it hurts. It's painful.

1183
01:09:38,011 --> 01:09:39,972
- Wait here.
- Where you goin'?

1184
01:09:41,348 --> 01:09:44,434
To meditate
on desire and suffering.

1185
01:09:44,518 --> 01:09:46,979
- Can I come?
- No.

1186
01:09:47,104 --> 01:09:49,064
Okay.

1187
01:09:49,148 --> 01:09:52,151
I'll see you in a little bit.
We'll do more, um, pure being? Pain...

1188
01:09:52,276 --> 01:09:54,236
I hope so.

1189
01:09:58,031 --> 01:09:59,992
Don't fucking leave me.

1190
01:11:18,111 --> 01:11:21,740
You look ugly! No, no, no.

1191
01:11:26,245 --> 01:11:28,664
- Hold up.
- No. No.

1192
01:11:28,747 --> 01:11:31,500
- No, go back inside.
- Can I have my car keys?

1193
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:34,545
You can't keep coming to work
if you dress like that.

1194
01:11:34,628 --> 01:11:36,755
Me and Daryl made some spots
Marty's gonna love.

1195
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:39,633
These are the best tops around.

1196
01:11:39,758 --> 01:11:42,553
Last time, last year,
not so good.

1197
01:11:42,636 --> 01:11:45,764
But now, this is the truth.

1198
01:11:56,900 --> 01:11:59,403
Marty's gonna hate them, Dawn.

1199
01:11:59,486 --> 01:12:03,198
- He's gonna hate them.
- There's glass between us.

1200
01:12:03,282 --> 01:12:05,909
You can't deal with
my infinite nature, can you?

1201
01:12:05,993 --> 01:12:09,037
That is so not true.
Wait, what does that even mean?

1202
01:12:09,121 --> 01:12:12,666
We've talked about your intimacy problem.
What's the core of it?

1203
01:12:12,791 --> 01:12:15,085
Intimacy is combo
of infinites.

1204
01:12:15,169 --> 01:12:18,922
I'm definitely gonna have an intimacy problem
with you if you keep dressing like that.

1205
01:12:19,006 --> 01:12:21,925
- Well, it's only been a week.
- One day is too much.

1206
01:12:22,009 --> 01:12:24,094
The people at the office
are freaking out.

1207
01:12:24,178 --> 01:12:27,389
You could get free, Brad, but you think
you have to be Superman in control.

1208
01:12:27,473 --> 01:12:31,143
And that means you are the source
instead of part of the infinite.

1209
01:12:31,268 --> 01:12:35,856
- And that makes it too hard for us, baby.
- Stop talking to me like that.

1210
01:12:35,981 --> 01:12:40,569
- You hired the detectives.
- You don't have to listen to every word they say.

1211
01:12:40,652 --> 01:12:44,490
- How am I supposed to know
which parts to listen to?
- I'll tell you.

1212
01:12:44,615 --> 01:12:46,783
- No, that's confusing.

1213
01:12:46,867 --> 01:12:49,870
- Take that off. Take it off.
- No. Can I have my car keys, please?

1214
01:12:49,995 --> 01:12:51,330
- Give me my glasses.
- No.

1215
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:53,040
- Give me my glasses.
- You give me my car keys.

1216
01:12:53,165 --> 01:12:54,333
- No.
- Yes.

1217
01:12:54,458 --> 01:12:56,418
You stay at home.
Till you dress normal...

1218
01:12:56,502 --> 01:12:58,504
you don't come to work.

1219
01:13:01,965 --> 01:13:03,926
Trees and bees...

1220
01:13:04,009 --> 01:13:06,512
- Hey, Daryl, where are you?
- Hi, honey.

1221
01:13:06,637 --> 01:13:08,597
- Dawn, this is Heather.
- Hey, I'm Heather.

1222
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:10,224
- Let's do it.
- Let's make a commercial.

1223
01:13:10,349 --> 01:13:12,476
- I'm a really big fan of yours.
- Well, thanks.

1224
01:13:12,559 --> 01:13:14,895
- It's so weird to meet my voice.
- Welcome to the family.

1225
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:19,483
What? This script only has my lines,
and I don't see another character here.

1226
01:13:19,566 --> 01:13:22,152
- I told you, you are the
trademark voice of Huckabees.
- So...

1227
01:13:22,236 --> 01:13:24,404
- Right. So what's the problem?
- She's the voice.

1228
01:13:24,530 --> 01:13:26,698
- I'm the face.
- Go, Heather.

1229
01:13:26,824 --> 01:13:29,326
- Girl, you could...
- Yeah, yeah.

1230
01:13:29,409 --> 01:13:31,703
All this,
and brains too.

1231
01:13:33,997 --> 01:13:36,333
Son of a bitch, Daryl!

1232
01:13:36,416 --> 01:13:38,627
They want me back in a bikini?

1233
01:13:38,710 --> 01:13:41,171
- Dawn, please.
- Wake up, pretty girl.

1234
01:13:41,255 --> 01:13:44,258
- The joke's on you! The joke is on you!
- Ow! Ow!

1235
01:13:44,383 --> 01:13:47,427
- No, stop.
- Don't look at me. I just want to be left alone.

1236
01:13:47,553 --> 01:13:51,098
I'm sick of this.
I'm sick of you all looking at me.

1237
01:13:51,223 --> 01:13:53,976
Look at me. Please,
please, please, everybody.

1238
01:13:54,059 --> 01:13:57,646
Everybody look at me now. I am so pretty.
I am so pretty. Look at me.

1239
01:13:57,729 --> 01:13:59,898
Everybody just wants
to be me. I'm pretty.

1240
01:14:00,023 --> 01:14:03,235
- Shania's on the stage.
We've got the executives here...
- That's great.

1241
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:06,113
Working their way back
to the, uh, lesser donators.

1242
01:14:06,238 --> 01:14:08,824
Right. Well, when we did
the Garth benefit in Dallas...

1243
01:14:08,907 --> 01:14:11,285
- we put the $10,000 donors up here.
- Wow, Garth.

1244
01:14:11,410 --> 01:14:13,370
Was that Garth Garth,
or Chris Garth?

1245
01:14:13,453 --> 01:14:16,248
- That's classic Garth. The best.
- Classic Garth costs.

1246
01:14:16,373 --> 01:14:19,585
Yeah, so, when we did the Garth benefit
in Dallas, that's what we...

1247
01:14:19,710 --> 01:14:21,920
Where's Marty?
Where is he?

1248
01:14:22,045 --> 01:14:23,964
Have you even seen
my commercials?

1249
01:14:24,089 --> 01:14:27,467
- Have you? I'm doing this for you.
- Oh, my God.

1250
01:14:27,593 --> 01:14:30,304
- They're your detectives,
and they gave me this truth.
- Wow. Nutty.

1251
01:14:30,429 --> 01:14:33,599
Do you understand?
There's glass between us!

1252
01:14:33,724 --> 01:14:36,685
Don't look at me like that!

1253
01:14:38,604 --> 01:14:40,856
- Hey, hey. Hey...
- There you are, Marty.

1254
01:14:40,939 --> 01:14:45,068
- Why don't you like my spots?
- Honey, this look is hurting you,
and it's hurting Huckabees.

1255
01:14:45,152 --> 01:14:48,489
- This is myself.
- Then you won't speak at the benefit as yourself.

1256
01:14:48,614 --> 01:14:51,366
- That is not Huckabees.
- I am still Huckabees.

1257
01:14:51,450 --> 01:14:53,994
- Not in that bonnet.
- It's in my eyes, Marty.

1258
01:14:54,119 --> 01:14:56,079
It's like that story
of the cave.

1259
01:14:56,163 --> 01:14:58,457
What in God's name
is happening to you?

1260
01:14:58,582 --> 01:15:01,668
We trusted you. We took care of you.
We made you into a national icon.

1261
01:15:01,793 --> 01:15:05,339
Pulled you out of a mall.
Eh, you've been given everything by Huckabees.

1262
01:15:05,464 --> 01:15:07,424
- Fuck-a-bees!
- Ooh.

1263
01:15:07,508 --> 01:15:10,177
- Wow, wow, wow.
- Bradley, there's board members here.

1264
01:15:10,302 --> 01:15:13,013
- She's knocking on the glass...
- That's not gonna look too good
for a new corporate guy.

1265
01:15:13,138 --> 01:15:14,890
- What? I got corporate?
- You got corporate.

1266
01:15:14,973 --> 01:15:17,601
- I got corporate?
- Yeah, you got corporate. Now go and contain her.

1267
01:15:17,684 --> 01:15:19,394
All right?
She said, "Fuck-a-bees."

1268
01:15:19,478 --> 01:15:22,231
- Yeah.
- She said fuck...

1269
01:15:32,491 --> 01:15:34,785
What are you doing?

1270
01:15:34,868 --> 01:15:36,870
What are you
doing to us?

1271
01:15:36,995 --> 01:15:39,540
I'm in my tree.
I'm talking to the Dixie Chicks...

1272
01:15:39,665 --> 01:15:41,708
and they're making me
feel better.

1273
01:15:41,834 --> 01:15:46,046
Well, I think the Dixie Chicks would like you
to know that I just got promoted.

1274
01:15:46,171 --> 01:15:48,924
- What?
- V.P. For public affairs.

1275
01:15:49,007 --> 01:15:51,134
I got corporate, Dawn.

1276
01:15:51,218 --> 01:15:54,012
I'm sorry you had to go through all this.
It's for the greater good.

1277
01:15:54,138 --> 01:15:57,349
I went to the detectives to shake Albert
out of the coalition.

1278
01:15:57,474 --> 01:16:00,602
- I admit that.
- This doesn't make sense.

1279
01:16:00,686 --> 01:16:02,855
Sweetheart, you're
mixing yourself up.

1280
01:16:02,980 --> 01:16:05,107
Listen, you're mixing
it all up.

1281
01:16:05,190 --> 01:16:07,234
- Wait a second.
- Huh.

1282
01:16:07,359 --> 01:16:09,945
Do you even care about
the marsh and the woods?

1283
01:16:10,028 --> 01:16:14,533
Yes, I care about the marsh and the woods.
Albert was not gonna save 'em his way.

1284
01:16:14,658 --> 01:16:17,870
You don't go through the back door
with a poem and a bonnet.

1285
01:16:17,995 --> 01:16:21,248
You go through the front door with a tie,
and you own the marsh and the woods.

1286
01:16:21,373 --> 01:16:23,333
That's how you're
gonna save 'em.

1287
01:16:23,417 --> 01:16:25,252
- Let's celebrate.
- Mm-hmm.

1288
01:16:25,377 --> 01:16:27,337
- You want some new clothes?
- Yeah.

1289
01:16:27,421 --> 01:16:30,591
- I'll get you whatever you want.
What do you need?
- I don't know.

1290
01:16:30,716 --> 01:16:33,927
- Pedicure?
- Yeah, but do I have to be pretty all the time?

1291
01:16:34,052 --> 01:16:37,389
Well, you know,
you have a choice.

1292
01:16:37,514 --> 01:16:40,934
But, no, it's not a choice.
I do have to be pretty.

1293
01:16:41,059 --> 01:16:44,396
Well, I'm pretty sure the Dixie Chicks
would want you to spread your love...

1294
01:16:44,521 --> 01:16:46,482
here where you can
at Huckabees.

1295
01:16:46,565 --> 01:16:48,817
Right. That's good.

1296
01:16:48,901 --> 01:16:52,237
You know what?
You got Albert fired.

1297
01:16:52,362 --> 01:16:58,118
Stay positive. Bermuda. Jet Skis.
Pia coladas. All right?

1298
01:16:58,243 --> 01:17:01,205
- Yeah.
- When you leave the office, will
you go through the back door?

1299
01:17:01,288 --> 01:17:04,082
Okay? 'Cause you
don't look so good today.

1300
01:17:04,208 --> 01:17:06,460
Okay. Okay.

1301
01:17:06,585 --> 01:17:08,420
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

1302
01:17:19,598 --> 01:17:21,600
Hey, Tom, Tom.

1303
01:17:23,268 --> 01:17:25,270
Go for it, man.

1304
01:17:44,081 --> 01:17:47,543
The woods are hopeless.
Don't waste your time. They will be destroyed.

1305
01:17:47,626 --> 01:17:50,045
So will the marsh.
It is a losing game...

1306
01:17:50,128 --> 01:17:52,965
mankind has played
for more than a century.

1307
01:17:53,090 --> 01:17:55,717
Sadness is what you are.
Do not deny it.

1308
01:17:55,801 --> 01:17:59,012
The universe is a lonely place,
a painful place.

1309
01:17:59,138 --> 01:18:01,515
This is what we can share
between us, period.

1310
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:03,851
Whoa!

1311
01:18:03,976 --> 01:18:05,936
H'yah!

1312
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:10,691
What are you doing?

1313
01:18:10,816 --> 01:18:13,193
You told me you were done
with this stupid method.

1314
01:18:13,318 --> 01:18:15,612
- Why can't I do it?
- Because it is a fantasy.

1315
01:18:15,696 --> 01:18:18,699
- Do you want to lead a fake life?
- You don't have to get so threatened.

1316
01:18:18,824 --> 01:18:20,909
- I can mix your thing with their thing.
- No, you can't!

1317
01:18:20,993 --> 01:18:23,537
- Why not?
- Because they are completely different.

1318
01:18:23,662 --> 01:18:26,790
And theirs is a lie. For the last time,
forget the tree fantasy.

1319
01:18:26,874 --> 01:18:29,168
And as for Brad,
you must do to him for real...

1320
01:18:29,293 --> 01:18:31,503
what he did to you, and...

1321
01:18:37,551 --> 01:18:41,221
You ditched me.
First my family, and now you guys.

1322
01:18:41,346 --> 01:18:45,058
- She's my teacher too, Albert.
- And she's still your teacher, Tom.

1323
01:18:45,184 --> 01:18:47,269
No. It's all different now.

1324
01:18:47,352 --> 01:18:50,314
I thought we were a platonic trio,
not some sick sex dance.

1325
01:18:50,397 --> 01:18:52,524
You said that was bullshit.

1326
01:18:52,649 --> 01:18:56,195
Learn from this, Tommy.
Painful truth.

1327
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:58,614
I warned you... human drama.

1328
01:18:58,697 --> 01:19:01,575
Is that why
you're doing this, to teach me?

1329
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:05,537
- Yeah, is that why you're doing this, to teach him?
- Of course it is.

1330
01:19:05,662 --> 01:19:09,208
There are unique moments when two people
share the deep sorrow of existence.

1331
01:19:09,333 --> 01:19:11,335
All right. That's what
I wanted to hear.

1332
01:19:11,418 --> 01:19:14,421
- How can you believe that bullshit?
- T-Tom... Tom, I'm sorry.

1333
01:19:14,546 --> 01:19:16,757
This just happened.
I've never done anything like this before.

1334
01:19:16,882 --> 01:19:20,093
- We could still be... You can
still be my other, right?
- Shut up, Albert.

1335
01:19:20,219 --> 01:19:24,431
I brought you here. I wanted to share
la force with you, and you ruined it.

1336
01:19:24,556 --> 01:19:27,643
- You fell in love.
- Do not defile it with clich.

1337
01:19:27,726 --> 01:19:31,396
- It is unnameable.
- Yeah? Well, I reject unnameable!

1338
01:19:33,357 --> 01:19:35,692
It leaves me out!

1339
01:19:35,776 --> 01:19:38,862
Where is your pure being now, Tommy?
I told you.

1340
01:19:41,532 --> 01:19:43,450
I'm just gonna accept
my loneliness.

1341
01:19:43,575 --> 01:19:46,078
And I'm gonna go
to an even darker place of nothingness.

1342
01:19:46,203 --> 01:19:49,581
From an even farther,
more extreme nothingness on my own!

1343
01:19:49,706 --> 01:19:53,460
- Who needs you guys?
- Ahh, sublime.

1344
01:19:53,627 --> 01:19:56,755
Hey, welcome.
You like my new office?

1345
01:19:56,880 --> 01:20:00,217
- Let's start with the method.
- Let's start with the method.

1346
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:02,302
- We'd like to discuss...
- We'd like to discuss...

1347
01:20:02,427 --> 01:20:04,388
- Okay. What are you doing?
- Okay. What are you doing?

1348
01:20:04,471 --> 01:20:06,473
- What are you doing?
- I'm jokin' around, guys.

1349
01:20:06,598 --> 01:20:08,559
But seriously, I want to quit
the process with you.

1350
01:20:08,642 --> 01:20:11,270
Nothing personal. I appreciate
what you've done for me, but I'm over it.

1351
01:20:11,395 --> 01:20:14,648
- You can't quit until the case is over.
- Ah, I can fire you.

1352
01:20:14,773 --> 01:20:16,358
- No, you can't.
- No, you can't.

1353
01:20:16,441 --> 01:20:18,569
- Sure I can.
- No, you can't.

1354
01:20:18,652 --> 01:20:21,280
Paragraph 201.
"Neither client nor detective...

1355
01:20:21,405 --> 01:20:26,201
"may terminate case prior to resolution
as defined by paragraph 314, subclause 'D'...

1356
01:20:26,285 --> 01:20:28,287
- which states..."
- That's not binding.

1357
01:20:28,412 --> 01:20:30,372
- Oh, it's binding.
- I'll find a lawyer.

1358
01:20:30,455 --> 01:20:32,833
- Oh?
- Or maybe even go to the FBI. How about that?

1359
01:20:32,958 --> 01:20:36,461
- Go ahead.
- Oh, I will. I'm not kidding.

1360
01:20:36,587 --> 01:20:39,047
No, Brad, this is how it works.
You go to the police.

1361
01:20:39,173 --> 01:20:41,800
You... You tell them
that you went to the existential detectives.

1362
01:20:41,925 --> 01:20:44,386
They ask why.
You say, "For personal reasons."

1363
01:20:44,470 --> 01:20:47,431
Or, maybe you wanted to
work the politics at your corporation...

1364
01:20:47,514 --> 01:20:50,476
- by rattling Albert Markovski.
- I never told you that.

1365
01:20:50,601 --> 01:20:53,270
- Well, give us a little credit.
- The police go to Huckabees.

1366
01:20:53,353 --> 01:20:56,732
They talk to them.
The board learns that rising star, Brad Stand...

1367
01:20:56,815 --> 01:20:58,817
has weird existential issues.

1368
01:20:58,942 --> 01:21:00,903
- Or he fakes them.
- Which is odd.

1369
01:21:00,986 --> 01:21:04,865
Which is worse.
And your girlfriend, the voice of Huckabees...

1370
01:21:04,990 --> 01:21:08,911
- is dressing like an Amish bag lady.
- Okay, I get it.

1371
01:21:08,994 --> 01:21:11,788
You know, Brad, suddenly
your star isn't rising anymore. It's sinking.

1372
01:21:11,872 --> 01:21:14,666
- Okay. I said I get it, Bernie. Relax.
- Passive-aggressive.

1373
01:21:14,791 --> 01:21:17,085
- Shut up.
- Aggressive-aggressive.

1374
01:21:17,169 --> 01:21:20,297
- Does Dawn want to quit?
- Dawn's into this crap for real...

1375
01:21:20,380 --> 01:21:23,801
which is the stupidest thing
I've ever seen in my life.

1376
01:21:23,884 --> 01:21:26,178
Shall we get back
to the case?

1377
01:21:26,303 --> 01:21:28,055
All right.
What you got on me? Nothin'.

1378
01:21:28,180 --> 01:21:31,600
Our staff did a little
field work in, uh, Cleveland.

1379
01:21:31,683 --> 01:21:35,521
- What? Talk to my family?
- Mommy and daddy look awesome.

1380
01:21:35,646 --> 01:21:40,067
- So do you. But this guy.
- Wha... Ah, he doesn't look too good.

1381
01:21:40,192 --> 01:21:44,780
- You bastards.
- He doesn't
look too good, does he, Brad?

1382
01:21:46,406 --> 01:21:49,993
How could you do this?

1383
01:21:57,251 --> 01:21:59,211
Ooh.

1384
01:21:59,336 --> 01:22:01,338
Mm-hmm.

1385
01:22:01,421 --> 01:22:06,635
Are you kidding me? He weighs 250.
He t... He talks about geckos all the time.

1386
01:22:06,718 --> 01:22:09,847
- What's the point?
- I thought he was a sweet, sensitive young man.

1387
01:22:09,930 --> 01:22:12,558
Oh, excuse me. You...
You spoke to my fat, sad brother?

1388
01:22:12,683 --> 01:22:15,060
- Yes, Brad, on the phone.
- Indeed, I did, at length.

1389
01:22:15,185 --> 01:22:19,356
Well, if he's so sensitive, why doesn't he lose
70 pounds and stop talking about geckos.

1390
01:22:19,439 --> 01:22:23,819
- Maybe he'll find some friends.
- Well, your brother feels
that you're ashamed ofhim.

1391
01:22:23,902 --> 01:22:27,614
Are you sympathetic to him?

1392
01:22:27,739 --> 01:22:31,160
- Are you kidding me? I gave him a car.
- Mm-hmm.

1393
01:22:31,243 --> 01:22:33,328
- I send him shirts.
- Mm-hmm.

1394
01:22:33,412 --> 01:22:36,123
L... Look.

1395
01:22:36,248 --> 01:22:38,250
Here, guys. Geckos.

1396
01:22:38,375 --> 01:22:41,003
And I keep 'em.

1397
01:22:41,086 --> 01:22:43,297
I'm a pretty good
older brother.

1398
01:22:43,422 --> 01:22:45,799
He wishes you would
listen to him more.

1399
01:22:45,924 --> 01:22:48,177
About what, geckos?

1400
01:22:48,260 --> 01:22:50,262
L... I don't have
all the answers.

1401
01:22:50,387 --> 01:22:52,848
But maybe he should listen
to me more and learn a little.

1402
01:22:52,973 --> 01:22:56,351
You have several stories that
you like to tell over and over and over.

1403
01:22:56,435 --> 01:22:59,688
Ohh. Oh-ho. That's not...
Come on. That's a lie.

1404
01:22:59,771 --> 01:23:03,901
- L... I'm not boring like him.
- Like the mayonnaise story. The mayo story.

1405
01:23:05,444 --> 01:23:07,404
May 18, sales meeting.

1406
01:23:07,488 --> 01:23:10,699
Shania's there, you know,
promoting her apparel, right?

1407
01:23:10,782 --> 01:23:13,660
- It's 4:00. She's starving.

1408
01:23:13,785 --> 01:23:16,288
She hates mayonnaise, right?
Allergic to it.

1409
01:23:16,413 --> 01:23:19,750
So I order a ton of tuna fish sandwiches.
Back then that's all she's eating.

1410
01:23:19,833 --> 01:23:21,919
Tuna fish. No mayo, darling.

1411
01:23:22,002 --> 01:23:24,171
June 5, driving range.

1412
01:23:24,296 --> 01:23:27,049
Nojoke.
We gave her a chicken salad sandwich once...

1413
01:23:27,132 --> 01:23:29,134
she threw up
in the back of the limo.

1414
01:23:29,259 --> 01:23:32,137
June 30, the lake.

1415
01:23:32,262 --> 01:23:34,848
Shania's there promoting her apparel, right?

1416
01:23:34,973 --> 01:23:37,184
It's 4::00, and she's starving.
She's a busy lady.

1417
01:23:37,309 --> 01:23:40,729
I order a ton of tuna fish sandwiches.
That's all she's eating back then, tuna fish.

1418
01:23:40,854 --> 01:23:44,274
July 9, Flight 27 to Chicago.

1419
01:23:44,358 --> 01:23:47,986
Shania's there promoting her apparel, right?
It's 4::00. She's starving.

1420
01:23:48,111 --> 01:23:51,240
The lady hates chicken salad.
Gave it to her once, she threw up.

1421
01:23:51,323 --> 01:23:55,828
- August 17, conference call.
- Shania's there promoting her apparel, right?

1422
01:23:55,953 --> 01:24:00,249
No mayo. She hates it. And she cannot eat
chicken salad. That's nojoke.

1423
01:24:00,332 --> 01:24:03,377
September 3, in traffic,
your cell phone.

1424
01:24:03,502 --> 01:24:07,089
Shania's there promoting her apparel, right?
Back then that's all she's eating, tuna fish.

1425
01:24:07,172 --> 01:24:10,008
No mayo. I eat two
of the sandwiches in front ofher.

1426
01:24:10,134 --> 01:24:13,095
She now eats one and a half.
Now she believes me.

1427
01:24:13,178 --> 01:24:17,141
She eats one and a half sandwiches
before she realizes it's chicken salad.

1428
01:24:23,564 --> 01:24:26,984
Why do you think that
you tell the mayo story so much?

1429
01:24:27,067 --> 01:24:29,069
- I don't know. Why?
- It's propaganda.

1430
01:24:29,194 --> 01:24:31,989
- For mayonnaise?
- For you.

1431
01:24:32,072 --> 01:24:35,951
Specifically, you're so impressive
because you know Shania.

1432
01:24:36,034 --> 01:24:38,245
And you're so strong,
because you pull one on her.

1433
01:24:38,370 --> 01:24:41,790
- You're a funny guy, a good guy.
- Keeping everyone laughing...

1434
01:24:41,915 --> 01:24:46,253
so that maybe, quote,
you don't get depressed.

1435
01:24:46,378 --> 01:24:48,422
Well, what's so great
about depression?

1436
01:24:48,547 --> 01:24:50,841
Nothing.
Unless it holds the key...

1437
01:24:50,924 --> 01:24:52,926
to something
you compulsively avoid...

1438
01:24:53,051 --> 01:24:55,179
so it will never be
examined or felt...

1439
01:24:55,262 --> 01:24:57,473
hence your behavior becomes
repetitive like the story.

1440
01:24:57,556 --> 01:24:59,558
- Like the story.
- Like the story.

1441
01:24:59,683 --> 01:25:02,019
- Like the story. Like the story.
- Like the story.

1442
01:25:02,102 --> 01:25:04,563
Shut up.

1443
01:25:10,235 --> 01:25:13,363
All right.
I don't have to tell stories.

1444
01:25:13,447 --> 01:25:16,742
What do you think would happen
if you didn't tell the stories?

1445
01:25:16,867 --> 01:25:19,119
- Are you being yourself?
- How am I not myself?

1446
01:25:19,244 --> 01:25:21,205
- "How am I not myself?"
- Myself.

1447
01:25:21,288 --> 01:25:23,248
- Myself.
- "How am I not myself?"

1448
01:25:23,373 --> 01:25:26,043
- How am I not myself?
- "How am I not myself?"

1449
01:25:26,126 --> 01:25:29,338
- How am I not myself?
- "How am I not myself?"

1450
01:25:30,464 --> 01:25:32,633
How am I not myself?

1451
01:25:32,758 --> 01:25:35,135
How am I not myself?

1452
01:25:35,260 --> 01:25:37,221
How am I not myself?

1453
01:25:37,304 --> 01:25:40,849
How am I not myself? How am I not myself?

1454
01:25:40,933 --> 01:25:44,853
How am I not myself?
How am I not myself?

1455
01:25:44,937 --> 01:25:48,982
How am I not myself?
How am I not myself?

1456
01:25:49,107 --> 01:25:51,443
- How am I not myself?
- Bradley?

1457
01:25:51,568 --> 01:25:53,821
She's starving.
She's a busy lady.

1458
01:25:53,946 --> 01:25:57,616
I order a ton of tuna fish sandwiches.
That's all she was eating back then, tuna fish.

1459
01:25:57,741 --> 01:26:02,246
- No mayo...
- Hey, Bradley, how do you like
the corporate men's room?

1460
01:26:02,329 --> 01:26:04,331
Freakin'awesome, man.

1461
01:26:04,456 --> 01:26:07,084
- Hey, Brad, you want
to hear something funny?

1462
01:26:07,167 --> 01:26:09,503
The Dundalee Cups are blowin'out
in the Sunbelt franchises.

1463
01:26:09,628 --> 01:26:12,756
How's that for super weird?
That's a good thing to bring to the table today.

1464
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:16,426
Right? You arejust
what the doctor ordered, my friend.

1465
01:26:16,510 --> 01:26:19,054
- Right?
- Right on.

1466
01:26:19,138 --> 01:26:22,808
Well, let's go, dude. I'm gonna introduce you
to the board of directors, my friend.

1467
01:26:22,933 --> 01:26:24,643
- John, what did Legal say?
- Jerry?

1468
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:26,979
- We have a legal problem.
- Well, I disagree.

1469
01:26:27,104 --> 01:26:30,357
Give him the Salmon Stripper, call it the
Bass Basher. They don't read English anyway.

1470
01:26:30,482 --> 01:26:33,610
- Just call it "Tuna Tornado."
- There you go. Legal can cover that.

1471
01:26:33,694 --> 01:26:36,196
Speaking of Shania and tuna,
Brad has the most incredible story.

1472
01:26:36,321 --> 01:26:39,158
- Go ahead, Brad.
- There's a Bass Basher
in Japan? What's that about?

1473
01:26:39,283 --> 01:26:41,869
- Well, we've got a trademark issue in Japan.
- You got a legal problem?

1474
01:26:41,994 --> 01:26:44,538
L-Let's hear the Shania story. I mean,
that's what they wanna hear.

1475
01:26:44,663 --> 01:26:47,708
- Yeah, come on, tell the Shania story.
- Come on, Brad.

1476
01:26:47,833 --> 01:26:49,668
I don't want
to tell that story.

1477
01:26:49,793 --> 01:26:51,753
- What?
- I don't want to tell that story, Marty.

1478
01:26:51,837 --> 01:26:54,840
Come on. You and Shania
are downtown in the loop in Chicago.

1479
01:26:54,965 --> 01:26:58,385
You're opening up the store.
Shania, she all of a sudden, she gets...

1480
01:26:58,510 --> 01:27:00,762
- She gets...
- Hungry.

1481
01:27:00,846 --> 01:27:05,392
- Really hungry. Right. And so, you order...
- Tuna sandwiches.

1482
01:27:05,517 --> 01:27:08,145
- Yeah, tuna fish.
- I thought she was a vegetarian.

1483
01:27:08,228 --> 01:27:12,524
You order tuna fish, okay,
but you realize that she's allergic to...

1484
01:27:12,649 --> 01:27:14,818
- Marty, no.
- She's allergic... Yes.

1485
01:27:14,902 --> 01:27:16,904
Come on.
She's allergic to what?

1487
01:27:25,496 --> 01:27:29,750
Why don't you and me go outside
and have a... have a talk? Come on.

1488
01:27:29,875 --> 01:27:32,419
- I'll be back in five.
- Five minutes?

1489
01:27:32,544 --> 01:27:35,631
- Is he gonna put a bonnet on?
- Be right back.

1490
01:27:35,714 --> 01:27:37,716
What the fuck was that?

1491
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:50,938
Fuck!

1492
01:28:12,459 --> 01:28:15,587
- You're gonna get on the truck like everybody else.
- Get on the bike.

1493
01:28:15,712 --> 01:28:17,381
- Truck! Truck!
- Bike.

1494
01:28:21,218 --> 01:28:23,178
Engine Company 54, stand by.

1495
01:28:23,262 --> 01:28:26,431
- I'm free as a bird!

1496
01:28:26,557 --> 01:28:29,143
You're just sittin'
in your gas guzzlers.

1497
01:28:29,268 --> 01:28:32,229
- So long, suckers!

1498
01:28:43,115 --> 01:28:46,076
Where are you guys?
I'm at the fire, man.

1500
01:30:16,917 --> 01:30:19,169
- Here we are.
- Pull it down.

1501
01:30:30,222 --> 01:30:34,059
Creation, destruction.
Creation, destruction.

1502
01:30:34,184 --> 01:30:38,063
Creation, destruction.
Creation, destruction.

1503
01:30:38,188 --> 01:30:40,149
Creation, destruction.

1504
01:30:47,531 --> 01:30:52,077
Oh, ho-ho-ho, no. Oh, no!

1505
01:30:54,955 --> 01:30:57,749
Everything. My life.

1506
01:31:00,544 --> 01:31:02,588
Why?

1507
01:31:02,713 --> 01:31:04,923
- Oh, Brad, look at yourself.
- My life.

1508
01:31:05,048 --> 01:31:08,635
- You're sitting in a big pile of shit.
- Brad, it's okay. Believe me.

1509
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:10,762
Nothing's okay.

1510
01:31:10,888 --> 01:31:13,891
Nothing's okay, so it's okay.

1511
01:31:16,310 --> 01:31:18,562
You think it's bad, right...

1512
01:31:18,645 --> 01:31:23,275
'cause your house is burning
and you might have lost yourjob?

1513
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:26,361
I gotta go...
I gotta go to a benefit.

1514
01:31:26,445 --> 01:31:28,572
Don't... Don't tell anybody.

1515
01:31:30,574 --> 01:31:35,078
No, tell everybody.
I don't care. Tell everybody!

1516
01:31:35,162 --> 01:31:37,164
- Oh, maybe not.
- Wait a second.

1517
01:31:37,289 --> 01:31:38,957
Oh, no, please,
don't tell anybody.

1518
01:31:39,082 --> 01:31:41,668
You didn't see me cry.

1519
01:31:41,793 --> 01:31:44,463
Nobody sees that picture!

1520
01:31:44,588 --> 01:31:48,050
- Nobody sees that picture! Why did you do that?
- No, no, no, no.

1521
01:31:48,133 --> 01:31:50,260
We didn't do this.
We would never do something like this.

1522
01:31:50,344 --> 01:31:52,971
- Never. Oh, maybe
sometimes. We didn't do this.
- Never.

1523
01:31:53,096 --> 01:31:55,682
Who the hell
is that lady with the camera?

1524
01:31:55,808 --> 01:31:59,394
- See-See... See, this isn't our thing.
- That is her thing.

1525
01:31:59,478 --> 01:32:03,148
We wouldn't do it like that.

1526
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:09,112
Why did you do that to me?

1527
01:32:32,886 --> 01:32:35,681
All right. I'm gonna go
to the benefit.

1528
01:32:35,806 --> 01:32:37,766
Screw all you bastards.

1529
01:32:37,850 --> 01:32:39,852
- Brad!
- Brad!

1530
01:32:39,977 --> 01:32:42,354
- Brad, we didn't do this.
- She did it, Brad.

1531
01:32:42,479 --> 01:32:45,524
Yes, I did.

1532
01:32:45,649 --> 01:32:49,570
That fire was
a bitch-ass thing to do.

1533
01:32:49,695 --> 01:32:51,655
No, it liberated you
from the Brad.

1534
01:32:51,738 --> 01:32:54,324
Or did it bond me to Brad
in the insanity of pain...

1535
01:32:54,408 --> 01:32:56,618
until I saw that
I'm Brad and he's me?

1536
01:32:56,702 --> 01:32:58,787
- Yes.
- No.

1537
01:32:58,871 --> 01:33:01,331
Come on.
You guys work together, don't you?

1538
01:33:01,415 --> 01:33:04,668
- We don't work together at all.
- Really? It's not like some secret deal...

1539
01:33:04,751 --> 01:33:07,421
where she picks up where you leave off,
and then we come back to you?

1540
01:33:07,546 --> 01:33:10,966
- There is no secret deal.
- Well, there should be,
'cause that's the way it works.

1541
01:33:11,091 --> 01:33:14,094
You're too dark, and you're not dark enough.
You three were close, right?

1542
01:33:14,219 --> 01:33:17,139
Maybe too close. Then it went sour
and propelled you into one extreme...

1543
01:33:17,222 --> 01:33:19,224
and you into
another extreme.

1544
01:33:19,349 --> 01:33:22,436
So, voil! Two overlapping,
fractured philosophies...

1545
01:33:22,561 --> 01:33:24,646
were born out of
that one pain.

1546
01:33:26,231 --> 01:33:28,984
Albert!

1547
01:33:29,067 --> 01:33:31,403
Wow.
What happened to him?

1548
01:33:31,528 --> 01:33:33,363
I don't know.

1549
01:34:14,112 --> 01:34:18,158
Hi. Welcome to the Omni Hotel.
Uh, we don't... We don't check bikes, sir.

1550
01:34:18,283 --> 01:34:22,079
- Yeah, treat it like it's a car.
- It... It's not a car. It's my job.

1551
01:34:36,510 --> 01:34:39,721
Tenth floor.

1552
01:34:39,805 --> 01:34:44,393
Welcome to the Huckabees
Open Spaces gala event.

1553
01:34:44,476 --> 01:34:46,353
Huckabees pledges to...

1554
01:34:46,353 --> 01:34:47,396
Huckabees pledges to...

1555
01:34:50,774 --> 01:34:53,485
- Davy, come on.
- Mr. Stand, you're not on the list.

1556
01:34:53,610 --> 01:34:56,905
- Let's talk to Marty.
- What are you calling me Mr. Stand for?

1557
01:34:56,989 --> 01:35:00,200
- Let me in. Marty, I'm me. I made it.
- Marty, will you let Brad in?

1558
01:35:00,325 --> 01:35:02,494
Brad, shh.
Keep him out.

1559
01:35:02,619 --> 01:35:05,080
- Has everybody lost their minds?
- What is this shit? Come on.

1560
01:35:05,205 --> 01:35:07,958
- I put this together. I put this together!
- I know it's tough.

1561
01:35:08,041 --> 01:35:10,127
Josh, I put this together.

1562
01:35:12,296 --> 01:35:15,132
Shania.

1563
01:35:15,215 --> 01:35:17,217
Shania!

1564
01:35:17,342 --> 01:35:20,012
- It's the new Miss Huckabees.
- Sorry. I thought you were Shania.

1565
01:35:20,137 --> 01:35:23,474
Can I get
your autograph, please?

1566
01:35:23,557 --> 01:35:26,059
These are still
the old pictures.

1567
01:35:26,185 --> 01:35:28,770
This is a collector's item
for sure. Thank you so much.

1568
01:35:33,358 --> 01:35:36,528
- What's this, Dawn?
- Do you love me?

1569
01:35:38,238 --> 01:35:41,658
- I think so.
- With the bonnet?

1570
01:35:43,410 --> 01:35:46,788
Uh... N...

1571
01:35:46,872 --> 01:35:48,874
It's over, Brad.

1572
01:35:48,999 --> 01:35:51,126
I had a fire and almost died,
and he came.

1573
01:35:51,210 --> 01:35:54,254
And he almost died
'cause he cares about the same things.

1574
01:35:54,379 --> 01:35:57,633
- And that shows there's
no nothing, even when you die.
- It's okay.

1575
01:35:57,716 --> 01:36:01,428
And he likes the bonnet.

1576
01:36:01,553 --> 01:36:03,555
Excuse me.
We have a V.I.P. Function here.

1577
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:05,766
I need to ask you guys
to leave, please.

1578
01:36:05,891 --> 01:36:08,560
The gentleman behind the bush,
you have to leave, please.

1579
01:36:14,399 --> 01:36:19,947
One world. One store.
Huckabees, the everything store.

1580
01:36:20,072 --> 01:36:23,867
Shopping, nature,
together.

1581
01:36:36,421 --> 01:36:40,259
- Did they let you in to the benefit?
- I didn't even try to get in.

1582
01:36:40,384 --> 01:36:43,345
Brad, I thought about chopping your head off
with a machete many times.

1583
01:36:43,428 --> 01:36:45,973
I thought about hacking you up
with an ax, Albert...

1584
01:36:46,098 --> 01:36:48,392
and smashing your face in
with a baseball bat.

1585
01:36:48,475 --> 01:36:50,561
Eighteenth floor.

1586
01:36:52,729 --> 01:36:54,690
- You going up?
- We're going down.

1587
01:36:54,773 --> 01:36:57,734
- Uh, no, I think you're going up.
- Right you are. Come on in.

1588
01:36:57,818 --> 01:36:59,778
Ma'am.

1589
01:37:01,405 --> 01:37:03,866
- Oh... Uh.
- MaryJane!

1590
01:37:03,949 --> 01:37:06,994
- Oh, at last.
- How could you?

1591
01:37:07,119 --> 01:37:10,956
- How could you do that to us, you liar?
- This is a win for us. Come on.

1592
01:37:11,081 --> 01:37:15,043
A Dexicorp mall in my grandfather's forest
is not exactly a win.

1593
01:37:15,169 --> 01:37:18,172
And they've already started surveying to...
to start construction.

1594
01:37:18,297 --> 01:37:20,340
- We saved the marsh.
- By giving them the woods.

1595
01:37:20,466 --> 01:37:22,759
Are we going up or what?

1596
01:37:22,843 --> 01:37:25,596
All you did was make Huckabees look good.
That's all you did.

1597
01:37:25,679 --> 01:37:27,931
Albert, how can you be calm?
Did you hear what Brad did?

1598
01:37:28,015 --> 01:37:31,101
- I'm dealing with it.
- Sit with me and Shania. You'll
see this is a win for us.

1599
01:37:31,185 --> 01:37:34,021
- Shania doesn't give a shit!
- Oh, Shania cares.

1600
01:37:34,146 --> 01:37:35,939
- Let's go!
- Shania doesn't give a shit!

1601
01:37:36,023 --> 01:37:38,775
- We saved the marsh...
- Fuck him!

1602
01:37:38,859 --> 01:37:41,987
- So you sold out the woods?
- This new mall is going to be very eco-friendly.

1603
01:37:42,112 --> 01:37:44,990
I saved half the trees.
Did I sell out the woods?

1604
01:37:45,115 --> 01:37:49,161
I don't know. I tried to do some good.
You know, I saved half of'em.

1605
01:37:49,286 --> 01:37:52,372
- Brad, I torched yourJet Skis.

1606
01:37:52,498 --> 01:37:55,125
- And my house?
- No, just yourJet Skis.

1607
01:37:55,209 --> 01:37:57,377
It spread to the house.
I'm sorry.

1608
01:37:57,503 --> 01:37:59,797
Thirty-sixth floor.

1609
01:38:02,341 --> 01:38:04,343
- You guys going down?

1610
01:38:04,468 --> 01:38:06,428
Good.

1611
01:38:08,889 --> 01:38:10,891
Who is that?
You or me?

1612
01:38:11,016 --> 01:38:13,936
Give me...

1613
01:38:14,019 --> 01:38:16,897
- Ow!

1614
01:38:17,022 --> 01:38:18,982
Give me that!

1615
01:38:27,199 --> 01:38:29,201
Hit the alarm.

1616
01:38:29,326 --> 01:38:31,954
- You're only smashing yourself, Brad!
- Yeah.

1617
01:38:34,206 --> 01:38:36,917
And now
I'm smashing myself!

1618
01:38:37,042 --> 01:38:39,002
Now I'm smashing myself!

1619
01:38:42,548 --> 01:38:44,842
- Stop it!
- Twenty-first floor.

1620
01:38:44,925 --> 01:38:46,927
Shania.

1621
01:38:47,052 --> 01:38:50,264
Brad, do you realize
when they destroy the woods...

1622
01:38:50,389 --> 01:38:53,767
- No, let me explain.
- The average temperature of
the marsh rises five degrees?

1623
01:38:53,892 --> 01:38:56,728
- The entire food chain is
degraded, starting with frogs.
- Let me explain.

1624
01:38:56,854 --> 01:38:59,523
Let me explain.
Okay, but we saved half the woods.

1625
01:38:59,606 --> 01:39:02,776
I'm a vegetarian, Brad.
I eat tofu tuna.

1626
01:39:02,901 --> 01:39:04,736
With the mayo,
and you liked it!

1627
01:39:04,862 --> 01:39:07,406
Shania, I'm Albert. I used to run the
Open Spaces Coalition.

1628
01:39:07,531 --> 01:39:10,659
- She knew my name. See?
- So what if she knew your name?

1629
01:39:10,742 --> 01:39:12,744
I was only joking, man.
Come on.

1630
01:39:15,038 --> 01:39:17,666
Yeah, okay,
I'm caught up in that shit.

1631
01:39:17,749 --> 01:39:21,420
- So am I. That's how I bought into you.
- Eighteenth floor.

1632
01:39:21,545 --> 01:39:25,507
Albert, we owe you an apology.
We should've stayed with you.

1633
01:39:25,632 --> 01:39:28,135
Thanks, Angela.
See you at the meeting on Tuesday.

1634
01:39:28,260 --> 01:39:30,429
We're gonna stop
those bulldozers.

1635
01:39:32,431 --> 01:39:35,309
- Oh, my goodness.
- I don't have a job.

1636
01:39:35,434 --> 01:39:37,811
I don't even know
who I am.

1637
01:39:37,936 --> 01:39:40,397
That's exactly
how I felt.

1638
01:39:41,773 --> 01:39:44,401
Try this lady.

1639
01:39:53,911 --> 01:39:56,246
Ah, here he comes!

1640
01:39:56,330 --> 01:40:01,168
- Oh, boy.
- The man-poet who banged France's
dark lady of philosophy.

1641
01:40:01,293 --> 01:40:04,630
The parking lot
crusader of truth...

1642
01:40:04,755 --> 01:40:09,009
who turned his back on his other
like a cold-blooded gangsta.

1643
01:40:09,134 --> 01:40:11,094
I know.

1644
01:40:11,178 --> 01:40:13,972
- You hurt my feelings.
- I'm sorry.

1645
01:40:14,097 --> 01:40:17,935
- But you had to do it anyway, didn't ya?
- She's a very powerful person.

1646
01:40:18,018 --> 01:40:20,687
- And I haven't been with a lot of women.
- Obviously.

1647
01:40:20,813 --> 01:40:26,193
And she used me to teach us
about the inevitability of human drama.

1648
01:40:26,318 --> 01:40:29,363
So? Is that where
you get off the ride?

1649
01:40:29,488 --> 01:40:32,282
Hell no.

1650
01:40:32,366 --> 01:40:35,327
I didn't think so.

1651
01:40:35,452 --> 01:40:38,831
- Looks like you saw some truth.
- Looks like you saw some truth.

1652
01:40:38,956 --> 01:40:42,376
- What'd you see?
- Well, the interconnection
thing is definitely for real.

1653
01:40:42,501 --> 01:40:45,754
- It is! I didn't think it was.
- I can't believe it. It's so fantastic!

1654
01:40:45,838 --> 01:40:47,339
- That's amazing.
- I know.

1655
01:40:47,464 --> 01:40:49,383
But it's also
nothing special.

1656
01:40:49,508 --> 01:40:52,302
Yeah, because it grows from
the manure of human trouble.

1657
01:40:52,386 --> 01:40:56,014
You see, the detectives,
they just wanted to gloss right over that.

1658
01:40:56,140 --> 01:40:59,268
But in fact,
no manure, no magic.

1659
01:40:59,351 --> 01:41:02,146
- Did you hear some of that?
- Some of it sounds pretty good.

1660
01:41:02,229 --> 01:41:04,857
I think...

1661
01:41:04,982 --> 01:41:07,192
I think this case
is closed.

1662
01:41:07,317 --> 01:41:09,278
Is it ever
really closed?

1663
01:41:09,361 --> 01:41:12,364
Hmm.

1664
01:41:20,038 --> 01:41:24,460
- What are you doing tomorrow?
- I was thinking about
chaining myself to a bulldozer.

1665
01:41:24,543 --> 01:41:27,504
- Do you want to come?
- What time?

1666
01:41:27,588 --> 01:41:30,549
Mm, 1:00, 1:30.

1667
01:41:30,674 --> 01:41:34,136
Sounds good.
Should I bring my own chains?

1668
01:41:34,219 --> 01:41:36,221
We always do.
