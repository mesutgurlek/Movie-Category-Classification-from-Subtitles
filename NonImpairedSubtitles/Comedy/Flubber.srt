1
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,957
Oh. Hmm.

2
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,877
Oh. Oh.

3
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,672
I`m up!

4
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,274
- Ah.
- Phillip, it`s 7:00. Are you awake?

5
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,477
Up and ready for a new day.

6
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,518
- Oh!
- Oh what a beautiful morning

7
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,477
Oh what a beautiful day

8
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,236
- I can`t find my socks.
- They`re in your shoes.

9
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,715
- Where are my shoes?
- They`re on your feet.

10
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,631
Thank you.

11
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,589
Thank you, Weber.

12
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,437
Hi.

13
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,198
- Have you seen the paper this morning?
- Oh, yes, I did.

14
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,311
You know, if I could solve
this whole metastable compound business,

15
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,351
I could save the college.

16
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,596
A new energy source
would be worth a fortune.

17
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,871
You better hurry up. The loan`s due
at the end of the school year.

18
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,350
Not to worry, Weebo.
I`m very close.

19
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,436
May I see my schedule, please?

20
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,552
Ahhhh. After school
there`s something.

21
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,477
I know there is. What is it?

22
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,795
- This is your complete schedule.
- Hmm. Let`s see.

23
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,751
Unless you didn`t
tell me something.

24
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,876
What is it? There`s something.
There`s something there.

25
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,831
What is it? Oh.

26
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,916
It`s something to do with white.

27
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,508
Oh, what is it? I know it`s
something important. I know it!

28
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,313
Well, I don`t know. I`m sorry.
I know it`s so frustrating, isn`t it?

29
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,795
I just hate that.
I wish I could help you.

30
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,878
- But I can`t.
- Haircut!

31
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,191
Ha! Hmm!

32
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,071
They can`t just
close down the school.

33
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,833
Outside of the lvy League,
name me one private college...

34
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,157
or university that isn`t
in financial trouble.

35
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,879
Oh, all right. Name another.

36
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,590
- You don`t think it`s too much?
- No. It`s elegant.

37
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,235
And it`s a wonderful idea to go
with the big wedding this time.

38
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,357
It does put the pressure
on the professor to show up.

39
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,755
If he forgets this time,
that`s it.

40
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,394
Well, in his case,
once is justifiable...

41
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,393
and twice is understandable,
but three times--

42
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,637
Coming through!

43
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,355
Morning-- or afternoon,
whatever the case may be.

44
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,950
We have a lot to talk about today,
so let`s get into it without delay.

45
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,396
Oh! Oh, uh, thank you,
whoever gave me the plate of fruit...

46
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,556
and the dead pheasant,

47
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,477
but it does not count
as extra credit.

48
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,194
Last time we were talking about
Newton`s Law of Gravitation.

49
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,592
To review: We see this "G"
is like the "C" in E=MC squared.

50
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,712
It`s a constant, constant universe,
as much as anything
is constant in the universe.

51
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,115
It`s saying that the force of
attraction between two bodies...

52
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,879
is in direct proportion to
the product of their masses...

53
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,150
and in inverse proportion to the square
of the distance between them.

54
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,513
An example would be-- Let`s make, uh,
naked man, "M-1." Naked lady, "M-2."

55
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,750
Now, according to this formula,
their attractive forces...

56
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,474
would want to close
the distance to zero.

57
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,353
Why don`t they? Hmm?

58
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,357
The Earth! Ah.

59
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:16,268
So, in essence that is
gravity and this...

60
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,109
is "Dr Richards Life Drawing."

61
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,515
It`s not my class, is it?

62
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,589
Phillip! Over here!

63
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,314
Sara! Ooh! Very sorry.

64
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,468
And so, momentum.

65
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,229
May I sit here? Thank you.

66
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,312
Hello, Sara.
What a pleasant surprise.

67
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,278
- Hello, Ruthie.
- Martha.

68
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,311
- Martha what?
- Martha. Me Martha.

69
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,874
You Martha. Me professor.

70
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,719
- Yes, I know.
- I was just gonna, you know,

71
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,473
grade my lunch, eat a few tests
and hope for the best.

72
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,989
- How do you hold it in?
- Well, like everybody else, Ruthie.

73
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,680
I just cross my legs real tight.

74
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,955
No. I was talking
about your excitement.

75
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,833
- Excitement?
- The wedding.

76
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,032
Congratulations!

77
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,270
The wedding! Sara and l.
Oh, the wedding.

78
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,436
Oh, l`m looking forward to it.
Aren`t you, honey?

79
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,193
- It`s today.
- Are you sure?

80
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,200
- The wedding is today. Okay?
- I believe you.

81
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:31,199
6:30 at the Presbyterian Church
on Beach Street.

82
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,676
- I`ve been there.
- We had our rehearsal there last night.

83
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,554
That`s right, we did!
It went well?

84
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,477
- Yes, it did, but it doesn`t count.
- Good.

85
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,114
- No?
- The wedding counts,
and I want you to promise me...

86
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,192
on everything between us
that you`ll be there, okay?

87
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,111
I`d rather die
than disappoint you.

88
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,756
Well, this is going to be
the very last time I try to marry you.

89
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,110
I imagine so.

90
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,031
I know that I love you,

91
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,953
but l`m not sure
that you can love me.

92
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,157
That`s ridiculous.

93
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,071
I love you with all my heart.

94
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,913
With every cell, with every
molecule, with every atom.

95
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,195
I love you on a subatomic level.

96
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,078
Hmm! Prove it to me
tonight at 6:30.

97
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,997
Prove what, honey?

98
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,510
- That you love me.
- I love you.

99
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,113
- 6:30.
- Good luck.

100
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,077
Thank you, Betty.

101
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,873
I knew I shouldn`t
have come, but--

102
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,389
Oh, l`m very crazy about him,
you see, Miss French.

103
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,516
And this is the God`s truth:

104
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,239
I want him to have
what he wants,

105
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,351
even if it means
you instead of me.

106
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,870
No, no! You love him.
Don`t give him up.

107
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,235
Hey! l`m watching something!

108
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,233
- Weber!
- Why don`t you be quiet?

109
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,788
I`m watching TV.

110
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,514
Download some manners! Ohh!

111
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,995
Oh, but he ain`t in love
with me, Miss French.

112
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,475
Mmm. Tell me about it.

113
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,477
Hello, Phil.

114
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,114
What are you working on?

115
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,158
Can`t remember?

116
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,396
I understand.

117
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,636
It`s a damn shame they`re
shutting your college down.

118
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,513
I read about it in the paper.

119
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,670
- It`s not over yet.
- Oh, we`re doing fine at Rutland.

120
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,394
No such financial problems. Hey!

121
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,556
Are you still working on
that lighter-than-air compound?

122
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,676
It`s a, uh,
propulsive polymer and--

123
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,075
I don`t mean to be rude,
Wilson, but l-- I have to go.

124
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,111
You don`t seem too happy
to see me, Phil.

125
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,470
- I`m not.
- Well--

126
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,553
All the years we`ve known
each other, studying, working together.

127
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:03,959
- What happened between us, Phil?
- Well, I just got tired of you
stealing my ideas, Wilson.

128
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,032
And what would you have done with them?
You would have misplaced them,

129
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,913
forgotten them, lost them.

130
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,871
There`s no doubt you`re
the brighter of the two of us.

131
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,673
You have a genius for science.
I grant you that.

132
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,995
It`s just the science
of daily life that eludes you.

133
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,432
I`ve heard that copper psych
before. Excuse me. That`s very volatile.

134
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,596
I won`t deny that I hate you
for your brilliance.

135
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,035
I`m petty, corrupt.

136
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,391
I probably would have gone mad trying
to compete with you in pure thought.

137
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,438
But, uh, l`m not
an innovator like you, Phil.

138
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,511
I`m an adapter, and to that end,

139
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,989
I have profited from your ideas.

140
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,509
- Why are you here?
- Well, to be honest,

141
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,631
I`m here this weekend
to steal your fiancee...

142
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,671
and make her my wife.

143
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,315
Well, I think you`ll be
sadly disappointed.

144
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,635
I`ll see you
at the wedding then.

145
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,031
Eh, it`s a little crooked.

146
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,957
- Yeah. There you go.
- Weebo?

147
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,991
- Mm-hmm?
- The wedding was not on my schedule.

148
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,548
- Mm, no?
- Why was that information deleted?

149
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,916
Hmm. I don`t really know.

150
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,110
- Do you have another virus?
- You know, now that you mention it,

151
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,031
- I am feeling a little feverish.
- Really?

152
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,951
Mm-hmm.

153
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,917
You are a little hot. Say "ah."

154
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,233
- Ah.
- Ah.

155
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,158
Ah!

156
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,635
Oh, yes!

157
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,394
Hot. Cold. Hot. That`s it.

158
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,397
The hydrocarbons have been
inhibiting the cooper pairs.

159
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,516
But if you go from hot
to cold very quickly,

160
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:35,758
you get a conductive polymer
and you complete the metastable sphere.

161
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,274
Behold! There it is.

162
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,755
Now it`ll work. Yes!

163
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,638
But, uh, w-what about
your wedding?

164
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,235
Sorry, Sara.

165
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,838
Should I call the church
and tell them you`ll be late?

166
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,954
Very good. Right.

167
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,274
Very good. Ah.

168
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,831
Flowing from the condenser
to the pressure reactor.

169
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,757
Yes.

170
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,996
Yes! Oh! lt`s ready.

171
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,148
Organic catalyst.

172
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,077
The positive...

173
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,909
and the negative.

174
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,190
Little touch of electricity.

175
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,876
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

176
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,234
Oh!

177
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,920
Wow. What a bang.

178
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,037
Yeah. Little touch
of electricity.

179
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,390
That`s not helpful.

180
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,317
Oh.

181
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,233
Mmm. Mmm.

182
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,275
- Oh, boy. This is not good.
- No, sir.
- Weebo?

183
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,119
- What?
- Get a broom.
- That`ll help.

184
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,191
Two years.

185
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,991
Wow.

186
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,435
Oh.

187
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,950
Oh, bless you. You have a cold.

188
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,150
You should.
It`s 77 degrees Kelvin.

189
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,674
That`s very cold.

190
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,274
Look. Come on.

191
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,039
All right, uh,
let`s try and describe you.

192
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:07,153
Uh, you`re an elastomer.
Yes, uh, um--

193
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,077
Ooh! You`re highly viscous.

194
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,997
But yet you can
phase-shift. Hoo!

195
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,997
Well, uh, let`s see.

196
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,475
You`re mouldable. Oh.

197
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,677
It`s a little ticklish.

198
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,035
Oh!

199
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,675
You`re foldable.
You`re gullible.

200
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,360
Oh. All right. Let`s see.

201
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,991
Oh, wait a minute. Okay. And--

202
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,953
Ooh. You`re ductile.

203
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,838
Oh! Oh. You`re elastic.

204
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,235
Let`s just see
how elastic you are. Okay.

205
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,635
I`m the hackeysack king.

206
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,950
Hoo!

207
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,833
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

208
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,428
Hey, hey!
Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey!

209
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,356
Bravo! Encore!

210
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,552
- Oh, boy. Uh, Weebo?
- Yes, sir?

211
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,240
- Take a picture.
- Okay. Look this way. Smile!

212
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,751
Yeow!

213
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,711
Ow!

214
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,070
- Weebo! lt`s amazing!
- Professor? Excuse me.

215
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,197
- It`s miraculous! lt`s--
- Professor, it`s gone!

216
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,630
It is! Oh! Oh!

217
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,072
Professor, I think you gave it
a little too much free will.

218
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,516
Oh, no.

219
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,549
There`s not a darn thing
to be afraid of, pal.

220
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,955
How can anything
get in your window?

221
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,877
It`s closed, okay?

222
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,036
Whoa!

223
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,913
Hey! Huh?

224
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,475
Oh! Huh!

225
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,872
- Whoa-oh!
- Yeah!

226
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,998
Ha!

227
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,712
Mmm! Whoa, Weebo! I got it!

228
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,274
Great. Now what are you
gonna do with it?

229
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,516
Oh! It has incredible inertia.

230
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,637
Mm, maybe it`s
just glad to see you.

231
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,751
- Weebo?
- Yes?

232
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,229
- Do you know what this is?
- Flying rubber?

233
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,238
Yes. That`s what it is.

234
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,954
It`s flying rubber.

235
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,355
It`s flubber!

236
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,515
Ouch.

237
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,669
- Thank you for waiting so long.
- Yes, ma`am.

238
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,677
I`m sorry, Sara.

239
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,316
Are you going to tell me,
"l told you so"?

240
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,391
No, no.

241
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,273
- I`m going to give you a ride home.
- Thank you.

242
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,436
There you are.

243
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,949
Careful. Watch your gown.

244
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,275
I`ve got it. Thank you.

245
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,076
It`s perfectly safe, Weebo. It`s just
an ordinary radioactive isotope...

246
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,475
that Weber is now removing
from the lead containment unit.

247
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,915
Very good, Weber.

248
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,190
Then you place
the radioactive isotope...

249
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,754
carefully behind
the sliding shutter.

250
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,029
You see, the sliding shutter
works just like a camera.

251
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,912
It regulates the flow
of gamma radiation.

252
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,073
Instead of billions of random particles,
you have a precise stream of energy.

253
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,558
Now we carefully place
the sliding shutter mechanism...

254
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,114
underneath the flubber.

255
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,629
And l`m burning up in here!
Weebo!

256
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,557
Over here.

257
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,592
The gamma radiation triggers a
metastable decay in the flubber itself.

258
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,511
- Right.
- Which releases enormous
quantities of energy,

259
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,431
- and that`s what propels the flubber.
- Of course.

260
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,590
Now doing it this way,
I believe, is a lot more scientific...

261
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,517
than dropping it
or kicking it...

262
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,596
or bombarding it
with light bulb photon flashes.

263
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,190
- Absolutely.
- I believe...

264
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,919
by controlling
the gamma radiation flux,

265
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,630
we can control the movement
of the flubber itself.

266
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,274
- Cross your fingers, Weebo.
- Here`s hoping!
- Good luck.

267
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,271
Oh, yes!

268
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,595
It works!

269
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,317
Descent, gradually.

270
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,038
Back up again. Yeah!

271
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,239
My wedding. Oh!

272
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,311
- I`ve gotta go, Weebo.
- But you haven`t finished
the experiment yet.

273
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,159
You`re just getting started.
You can`t just stop in the middle.

274
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,754
The wedding. Oh, I can`t
miss this one, Weebo.

275
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,831
I`m aware of the time.
Thank you.

276
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,480
But your days are wrong.
I`m getting married Friday, 6:30 p.m.

277
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,070
- No. No, you`re not.
- Why not?

278
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,038
Because you`re not
getting married, Phillip.

279
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,993
- Yes, I am.
- You missed the wedding.

280
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,356
It`s 6:30 in the morning.

281
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,755
No. No.

282
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,189
Yes. I`m sorry.

283
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,149
- It is?
- Yeah.

284
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,829
Sara.

285
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,071
Sara?

286
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,239
You have a lot of nerve
to show your face around here...

287
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,079
after what you did to me
last night.

288
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,799
Will you please let me explain?

289
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:48,914
No. There`s nothing to explain.
You weren`t there.

290
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,639
For the third time you left me
standing at the altar.

291
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,274
I`m sorry with all my heart.

292
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,430
But please listen to me, Sara.
Please. You know me.

293
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,233
You know how sometimes I can get
really fixated on an idea?

294
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,151
- I don`t want to hear it.
- Sara, you`ve got to hear it.

295
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:08,268
Sara, this is the reason
I didn`t make it last night.

296
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,480
It`s flubber.

297
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,034
Flubber! lt`s a metastable
compound, Sara.

298
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,594
In layman`s terms, if you apply
a small amount of energy,

299
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,237
it liberates an enormous
quantity of energy.

300
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,157
But the total effect
is transient, Sara.

301
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:27,114
The moment you stop applying energy,
it returns to a quasi-plasmoid state.

302
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,829
- Isn`t it remarkable, Sara?
- What`s remarkable, Phillip,

303
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,757
is that I ever fell
in love with you.

304
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,952
You broke my heart...

305
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,871
so that you could stay home
and make some green goo.

306
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,110
Sara, it`s much more than that.

307
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,158
Flubber could save this college.
Let me demonstrate.

308
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,391
- No, no, no.
- Just give me one minute, okay?

309
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,949
The flubber is placed
in my back pocket.

310
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,713
When I exit this window,
I will fall to the ground.

311
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:58,749
When I hit the ground, the flubber will
send me right back up unharmed. Watch.

312
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,914
- Ta-ta, my love.
- Are you nuts?

313
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,476
- I`ll be right back.
- Phillip!

314
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,953
Ah!

315
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,876
- Ouch.
- Phillip, are you hurt?

316
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,991
Just my pride.

317
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,629
Well, if you think that
you are going to get my sympathy,
you are wasting your time.

318
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,479
Ooh! We are finished!

319
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,713
Sara.

320
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,712
Oh!

321
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,756
Junior`s home.

322
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,192
Dad? Dad!

323
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,277
Dad?

324
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:09,832
Somebody in your organization
screwed up big time.

325
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,115
I got thrown off
the basketball team.

326
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:17,638
I flunked chemistry.
I`m on, uh, academic probation.

327
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,513
- How did this happen?
- I`m supposed to get A`s.

328
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,393
- At least, that`s what I was told.
- The only reason...

329
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,829
I loaned this "jerknut"
college money...

330
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:30,277
was so he could get straight A`s
and go to Harvard Business School.

331
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,755
- This isn`t supposed to happen.
- Yes, sir.

332
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:36,150
We talked to the, uh, that Brainard guy,
the chemistry professor.

333
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,840
Now, either he did not
understand us, or he forgot.

334
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,315
The-The boy knew we were having
persuasion problems, sir.

335
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,274
I have a science requirement,
you morons!

336
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,391
Quiet.

337
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,556
We`ll have to get the "F"
changed to an "A."

338
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:54,675
It won`t work. This guy? He
doesn`t live in the real world.

339
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,109
- He has principles.
- Get something on him...

340
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,993
that we can use to force him
to change the kid`s grade.

341
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,556
When a man says he has
principles, what he means is...

342
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,240
he can`t be bought cheap.

343
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,797
Hmm. Hmm.

344
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,830
Adding 500 milligrams...

345
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,191
crystallized flubber
to common hand cream.

346
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,117
Stirring in solution.

347
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,077
Hmm.

348
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,197
Hmm. I just need one
spherical test subject.

349
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,951
Mm. Perfect.

350
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,996
Yeah. Now, about two--

351
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,193
Applying flubber
in a solution...

352
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,710
externally to golf ball.

353
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,317
All right. Very good.

354
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,517
Evenly over the entire surface.

355
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,437
Kinetic test number one.

356
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,510
Oh. Oh! Oh!

357
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,389
Ooh! Ah!

358
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,073
Are you all right?

359
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,395
All right.

360
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,756
Applying light coating
of flubber...

361
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,836
to surface of bowling ball.

362
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,751
All right.

363
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,394
Oh. Very good.

364
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,230
- Right in the head.
- That golf ball was really moving.

365
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,157
- How`d he do that?
- I don`t know.

366
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,113
Commencing kinetic energy
test number two.

367
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,949
Controlling horizontal momentum.

368
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,877
Commencing now.

369
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,550
Hit the deck!

370
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,193
This definitely has applications
in the field of sports.

371
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,390
Ho, ho, ho! Yes!

372
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,836
Oh!

373
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,231
What?

374
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,117
Fluid flubber...

375
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,437
with a convenient
spray applicator.

376
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,831
It`s clogged. Hmm.

377
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,719
- You seen enough?
- Plenty.

378
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,759
All right, after the bowling
ball hits, we break for the car.

379
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,760
Oh, wait a minute.
You can adjust it.

380
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,510
Go!

381
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,871
Oh, damn! Oh!

382
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,710
- Yes! Weebo?
- Yes, sir?

383
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,950
- It`s gonna work.
- I hope so.

384
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,315
Now, let me show you how.

385
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,638
I connected the accelerator
to a sliding shutter.

386
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,593
If I press down on the accelerator,
it releases the gamma rays,

387
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,557
and that increases the thrust.

388
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,399
Ah. Listen to that baby chirp.

389
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:33,195
Now, the steering wheel
controls lateral motion.

390
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,236
- Mm-hmm.
- If you turn right,

391
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,157
- Okay.
- it`ll steer right.

392
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,317
- Ah! Turns right.
- Turn the wheel left, it steers left.

393
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,318
So, it functions a lot like
a normal automatic shift...

394
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,595
- with drive, park, neutral, reverse.
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.

395
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,439
- It`s that easy. See, Weebo?
- Professor!

396
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,670
- Weebo?
- Help! Let me out!

397
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,030
- Oh, Weebo!
- Professor!

398
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,111
- Oh!
- What were you doing in there?

399
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,351
- Flirting with the alternator.
- Hope you didn`t touch anything.

400
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,910
It`s not the time to play. We`re about
to make a major breakthrough.

401
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,713
Okay, here we go.

402
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,394
Yeah. I think we`re ready.

403
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,516
- Weebo?
- Yes?

404
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:14,309
What do you say
we take her for a ride?

405
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,233
- Fly me to the moon!
- That`s it. That`s the spirit.

406
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:20,392
We`ll fly over to Sara`s house,
park this baby on the roof,

407
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,311
and then maybe she`s
gonna change her tune.

408
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,868
You know, maybe you should
just go without me.

409
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,474
- Why?
- Because I get carsick.

410
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,516
- Oh, come on.
You`re not gonna blow chips.
- No?

411
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,636
- You don`t have a stomach.
- I have a queasy gyro.

412
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,719
Now get over it. This is not
about cars. This is about Sara.

413
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,628
- Now get in here.
- No!

414
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,551
- Now.
- All right.

415
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,031
Oh! We`re fine now.

416
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,429
- Ah! Out into the world.
- Okay, here we go.

417
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:51,996
Look at this! Let`s see
what this baby will do!

418
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,835
Oh! It works!

419
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,837
- Yes, it does.
- I`m psyched!

420
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:02,356
Oh, boy.

421
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,277
- You know what this means, Weebo?
- What?

422
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,994
I`ll never have
to buy tyres again.

423
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,435
Ah. Let`s see what`s
on the radio, Weebo.

424
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:12,870
Ho! Latin!
Bam ba-bum, ba-bum, ba-bum

425
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,111
Bum ba-bum ba-bum
Hey!

426
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,077
Bum-bum be-bum bum

427
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,229
Right turn.

428
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,788
Whoa! Yes!

429
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:35,156
Huh? Huh? Oh!

430
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,194
Ah! We`re fine.

431
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,791
Whoa! Oh.

432
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:49,152
- It`s all right. I saw it.
- I don`t think so.

433
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,475
Weebo, there is
nothing to worry about.

434
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,109
Oh-- Mayday!

435
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,672
Come on. Easy.

436
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,278
Oh! Sorry.
First-time flyer. Shh!

437
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,799
I`m very sorry!

438
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:33,356
Hang on, Weebo!
Oh! Ha, ha, ha! Oh!

439
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,750
Whoa! Oh! Oh, Weebo!

440
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,836
Oh, now, we`re cookin`!

441
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,751
Whoa!

442
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:49,312
Oh!

443
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,637
Oh! Yes!

444
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,515
Oh, Weebo. Come on up.

445
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,955
Please. You`ve gotta see this.

446
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:09,397
Wow! ls this
what you call heaven?

447
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,711
Almost. Look at it.

448
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,759
The whole world below
and beyond.

449
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,348
- It`s beautiful.
- The solitude up here.

450
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,677
The stillness.

451
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,677
- The silence.
- Uh-oh.

452
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,191
Silly me turned it off.
Turns right back on.

453
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,999
The shutter`s jammed probably,
Weebo. We`re okay.

454
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,632
Start right up.
Oh, please turn over!

455
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,835
For the love of Newton,
turn over!

456
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,111
Abandon ship!

457
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,029
Oh!

458
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,111
Yes!

459
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,837
It`s such a pleasure
to spend time with you...

460
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,076
without having Brainard
hovering above us.

461
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,997
Mmm.

462
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:16,317
- More wine?
- No. No, thank you.

463
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,271
I have to say good night.

464
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,595
I have a busy,
busy day tomorrow.

465
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,471
Mmm.

466
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,597
Rutland would die to have you.

467
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,792
We`d be together
with nothing but time.

468
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,076
Sara?

469
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,156
Mmm.

470
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,156
I`m sorry, Wilson.

471
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:58,392
Forget it. It`s okay.
We have lots of time.

472
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:03,150
Listen, l`m-l`m driving up
on Thursday to Rutland for the game.

473
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:06,471
- I`ll see you there.
- Should I make dinner reservations?

474
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,154
Since Rutland is going
to lose, l`ll pay.

475
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,317
All right. If your team wins,
you can buy me dinner.

476
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:15,352
If your team loses, we go up to
the mountains for the weekend.

477
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,476
- Mmm--
- Cad!

478
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,509
- Do we have a bet?
- I`ll think about it.

479
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,311
I can`t lose. She`s mine!

480
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,635
Sir lsaac.

481
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,911
Out!

482
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,354
All right.

483
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:51,155
One more time. What happened?

484
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,113
He took a golf ball,
he rubbed this cream on it,

485
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,630
and then the golf ball
took off and...

486
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,557
popped Smith in the head.

487
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,716
- Several times.
- Mm-hmm.

488
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:06,351
- I got hit with a bowling ball.
- Repeatedly.

489
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,711
- Were you drinking?
- No.

490
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,877
Two beers at dinner.
Wesson had a white wine.

491
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,996
- With dinner.
- Right.

492
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,670
It`s this stuff
he`s got, sir. It`s--

493
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,837
I don`t know what it is. I don`t
know where it comes from, but...

494
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,239
it will give you
one heck of a headache.

495
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:33,796
Oh, goodness.

496
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,510
I-l wish I could
make you feel better.

497
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,797
Hmm. So do l.

498
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:44,037
Well, maybe l`m old-fashioned,
but I believe...

499
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,355
a woman should love a man
for what he is,

500
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,074
and not for what
she wants him to be.

501
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,436
Thanks for the
sentiment, Weebo, but...

502
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:56,235
this is really not an area you`re
qualified to offer perspective on.

503
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,471
Well, I don`t have much of
a smile, but I do have a brain.

504
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,989
I have to deal with this alone.

505
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,917
It`s a human matter,

506
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,031
not for computers.

507
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,515
It`s for people.

508
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,592
- Good night, Weebo.
- Good night, Professor.

509
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,597
Hmm.

510
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,228
- I got it!
- Oh, no!

511
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:16,432
I gotta turn this thing off.
This is so embarrassing.

512
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,791
Weebo, I just had
this amazing dream!

513
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,269
- Weebo!
- Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry!

514
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:26,277
Weebo! Weebo!

515
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,834
- Weebo! Wake up!
- Mmm.

516
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:35,234
- I`ve solved all our problems.
- I`m all ears.

517
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:39,638
Flubber is going
to the basketball game.

518
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,029
- Basketball?
- Yes!

519
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,471
Testing, testing.

520
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,275
Applying a thin layer
of fluid flubber...

521
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,920
to synthetic leather surface
of basketball.

522
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,876
Application complete.

523
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,791
Wow!

524
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,559
Oops.

525
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,957
Two points.

526
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,514
Implementing plan "B."

527
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,393
Very tight. Tight.

528
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,239
And careful, careful,
careful, careful.

529
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,191
Secondary flubber experiment.

530
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,510
Control elements: bungee cord,

531
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:48,428
three-to-one elasticity ratio,
fifty-pound ballast.

532
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:50,829
Commencing now.

533
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,751
Wish me luck.

534
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:57,430
Oh! Whoa!

535
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,276
Yes!

536
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,516
Ha, ha!

537
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:07,189
Whoa! I got it!

538
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:14,591
Oh! Bungee! Bungee!

539
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,517
Oh! Oh!

540
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,870
Uh, help.

541
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,070
Uh, yeow!

542
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,231
It worked!

543
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,876
Yes!

544
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,797
End test.

545
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:53,719
Did you fully fix the flubber
on each tack before we painted?

546
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,553
Excuse me, Darth Vader,
but what did you say?

547
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:00,474
Did you fully fix a 15%
flubber solution to each tack
before Weber started painting?

548
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:03,353
- Yes, l`m positive.
- Excellent.

549
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,710
And how long does it take
the paint to wear off?

550
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:08,070
- Uh, 30 minutes.
- Be a little suspicious...

551
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,037
if the flubber started
working immediately.

552
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:14,039
- Uh, isn`t this cheating?
- No, it`s not cheating.
It`s equalizing.

553
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,469
You`ve seen the team. They
should have their own telethon.

554
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,670
Come on! We`ve got
to win this game.

555
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,633
I`ve gotta do it to prove to
Sara that flubber really works.

556
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:25,469
I`m gonna do it right under
Wilson Croft`s nose.

557
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,397
Don`t fail me.

558
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,438
- Weebo.
- Yes?

559
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,670
- While l`m out, you`re in charge, okay?
- Okay.

560
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,115
- No phone calls to Russia again.
- I think that was Weber.

561
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:48,432
Oh! Make sure the flubber
stays in the tank.

562
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,869
- Got it.
- Under no circumstances
are you to release it.

563
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,797
- Of course.
- Because you know what would happen.

564
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:56,276
- Ho, ho, ho.
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir, I understand.

565
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,676
- Promise?
- Have no fear.

566
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:02,633
That`s my girl.

567
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:06,349
Go Medfield!

568
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,630
Okay.

569
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:11,798
Good evening, everybody,
and welcome to Rutland Arena...

570
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,832
for the 86th meeting of the Rutland
Rangers and the Medfield Squirrels.

571
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,076
Rutland, if they can just
stay awake, should be able...

572
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,230
to steamroll the Squirrels
here tonight at the--

573
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,555
All right, Squirrels,

574
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:24,712
Iisten up here now.

575
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:29,032
Okay, Rutland may have us
in height and reach,

576
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,395
weight and power,

577
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,590
agility, speed and talent.

578
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,598
They have the advantage
on offence...

579
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,870
and defence.

580
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,719
Sure, they`re-they`re
better coached,

581
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,711
better trained,

582
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:48,914
and their will to win is
unmatched in the conference.

583
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,560
They`re undefeated
in their last...

584
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:55,434
one hundred and eight games.

585
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:59,593
But that doesn`t mean we can`t
whip these guys. Right?

586
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,076
- Yeah!
- Ohh!

587
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:23,000
Rutland! Rangers!

588
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:26,271
Rutland! Rangers!

589
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,393
Okay, flubber, it`s time
that you and l...

590
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,311
got to know each other.

591
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,032
Ow!

592
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,514
Another easy basket
for the Rutland Rangers.

593
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:58,354
They have built up a commanding
lead in the first half.

594
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:07,036
- Evening, Sara.
- Excuse me?

595
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:09,390
What a coincidence.

596
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,834
Dunk it! Dunk it!

597
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,837
Take it!

598
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,317
Come on, you guys!
You gotta do--

599
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,635
Not now, Ernie! Not now!

600
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,557
Go Medfield!

601
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:33,713
- Ow!
- Oh, sorry. Sorry, Wilson.

602
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,996
See if you can get me
another ten grand on Rutland.

603
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:50,038
- You got a problem, Bennett?
- You`re betting against my team?

604
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,709
It`s not your team. They
threw you off, remember that?

605
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:00,350
Ooh. Oh, baby.
That`s gotta hurt.

606
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,199
He fouled him!
He threw his hip into that!

607
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,988
Flubber? Flubber!
Where are you?

608
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,909
Mambo

609
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,591
Mambo!

610
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,556
Yeah!

611
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:41,555
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

612
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:44,633
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey!

613
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,917
Yeah!

614
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,517
Yeah!

615
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,673
Welcome back to Rutland Arena
for half number two.

616
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,872
The Medfield Squirrels tonight
are getting their nuts buried,

617
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,230
trailing by 51 at intermission.

618
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:49,189
If Coach Barker has any sense,
he has to be thinking forfeiture--

619
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,033
...for half number two.

620
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,116
Come on, boys.
Expect the unexpected.

621
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:56,629
Dale. Come on now, son.
You can do it.

622
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:59,877
Come on, Bruce. There we go.
Werner, be a flying squirrel!

623
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,310
Bart, the impossible`s possible.
Come on, Lawrence!

624
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,476
- Rodents rule!
- Loser!

625
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,757
Show time.

626
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:19,279
Keep going! Open!

627
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,877
Oh!

628
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:36,354
- Yeah! Get `em!
- Come on!
- Defence, defence!

629
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,356
- Come on!
- That`s pretty good.

630
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:43,998
Yeah!

631
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:49,070
Okay! Go! Beat them! Let`s go!

632
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,354
Oh!

633
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,396
- Yes! Yes!
- Gosh! We`ve never--

634
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:09,712
Yeah! Did you see that?
Did you see that, Dad? Yes!

635
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,191
What the--

636
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,913
We did it!

637
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,275
Wow! Wow!

638
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,198
Hey, are you blind? They`re doin`
something illegal out there.

639
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,590
Coach, nowhere in the rule book does
it say anything about jumpin` too high.

640
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:36,150
Now sit down!

641
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:38,874
Looks like a lonely weekend
in the mountains for you, Croft.

642
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,911
Come on, Squirrels!

643
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:55,679
Yea!

644
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,075
Did you see that, Croft?

645
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,436
Down, down!

646
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:11,637
Yes!

647
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,397
Yeah, yeah!

648
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,311
A tack.

649
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:35,308
Oh. Dale!

650
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,550
No!

651
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:40,433
Dale! Not the tacks!

652
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:43,313
- I don`t know.
- Okay, now, this game is not over yet.

653
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,635
You just wanna steal the ball
and then score!

654
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,591
Pardon me, boys.
Educator coming through.

655
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:50,797
Coach, I know very little about
basketball, but I do know chemistry.

656
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:53,713
And l-l believe that Dale is having
a problem, not with motivations,

657
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:56,439
but with some sort of adhesive buildup
on the bottom of his shoes.

658
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:59,114
- Do you have any ethyl alcohol?
- What?

659
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,873
- Excuse me. Hello, Dale.
- Coach.
- Oh, hello, Professor Brainard.

660
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:04,030
- May I see your sole?
- Wh--

661
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:07,470
- I mean, the bottom of your shoe.
- Oh, oh.

662
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:11,559
Now, the game`s not over yet. Keep your
chin up and your potential energy high.

663
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,875
`Cause you know why, Dale?

664
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:17,473
Son of a--

665
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:20,956
Get the ball.
Jump with all your soul.

666
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:22,911
B-- But l`m
on this end, sir. I--

667
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,951
Jump! Or l`ll flunk you.

668
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:27,469
- Uh-- What?
- You heard me.

669
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:31,275
Jump, or l`ll flunk you out
of my department for good.

670
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,471
Okay.

671
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,671
I think that`s
a little harsh, but--

672
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:41,877
- Jump!
- A-T-T-A-C-K!

673
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,470
The Medfield Squirrels are trying
to complete this astonishing comeback.

674
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:50,116
- Nice and patient, Rutland.
Plenty of time, baby.
- Rutland has the lead
with the clock winding down.

675
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,595
These rodents have fought
their little hearts out tonight,

676
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:56,116
but it looks like the Squirrels
are gonna come up a couple
of nuts short of a bushel.

677
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:58,998
Playing keep-away are the Rangers.
Here`s a wide-open "J" by Hatch.

678
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:00,911
Jump, Dale! Jump!

679
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,909
Jepner is soaring
into the air, makes the steal.

680
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:08,919
Look at him go! Jepner, with wings
on his shoes, soaring to the other end!

681
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,309
He`s all over it.
He dives. He`s through!

682
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:15,149
And Medfield upsets Rutland
on an incredible play by Dale Jepner!

683
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,236
- No!
- And the Squirrels are going nuts.

684
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:19,629
- Yeah!
- We won!
- Oh, we did it!
- Foul!

685
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,910
- We did it!
- Foul! Foul!

686
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:25,555
Since when is it within the
rules for a player to accompany
the ball through the hoop?

687
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:28,797
Oh, I don`t know. Come on.
I owe you dinner.

688
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:32,594
- Sara?
- Good night, Phillip.

689
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,591
Good night.

690
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,954
Brainard had something
to do with this.

691
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:43,749
It-lt`s the same stuff we saw
the other night over at his house.

692
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:45,398
Right.

693
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:52,119
I don`t know how, but l`m absolutely
certain your team cheated.

694
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,395
Oh, you`re just being
a sore loser.

695
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:58,638
Sara, m-m-may I speak
to you for a moment? Alone?

696
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:01,188
What you have to say to her,
you can say to both of us,

697
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:03,748
if you can remember.

698
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,717
Sara?

699
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:09,394
- Flubber.
- Flubber?

700
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:12,040
Sounds like baby shampoo.

701
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:16,870
Flubber is what won the game.

702
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,076
That amazing aerial ballet...

703
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,634
was because I flubberized
the boys` shoes.

704
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:24,911
A little on the bottom-- Whoo!

705
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:28,237
You are remarkable.

706
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,397
Sara?

707
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:36,114
Good night, Phillip.

708
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:38,634
Watch yourself.

709
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:42,833
Now what do we have to do
to get you to take a hint?

710
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,757
It`s over, Phillip. You lost.

711
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:47,189
Go home. Play with your rubber.

712
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:18,797
What kind of car does
that Brainard fellow drive?

713
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:21,553
Old T-Bird. Why?

714
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:25,036
- I just saw it.
- So?

715
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:27,429
It was flying.

716
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,958
You heard me. Flying.

717
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,309
- Hey, who won?
- We did.

718
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:46,029
Um, Professor,

719
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:48,315
why the long face?

720
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:55,639
- I think you know why.
- Would it be a Sara issue?

721
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:59,789
Wish I understood human beings.

722
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:04,197
Wish I understood women.

723
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:07,949
Wish I understood emotions and passions.
I wish I understood any of that.

724
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:11,789
If I did, I wouldn`t have had to spend
my entire life in a laboratory...

725
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,956
trying to figure out
how the world works.

726
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:16,833
I would`ve been out in the world
trying to figure out why it works.

727
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,631
I know I love her, Weebo.

728
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:28,110
Every neuron in my limbic system
is saturated with phenylethylamine.

729
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:32,119
That triggers euphoria,
elation, exhilaration.

730
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:34,231
Truth is, Weebo,

731
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:38,239
I`m not absent-minded because
l`m selfish or crazy or--

732
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:41,193
or inconsiderate.

733
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,635
I`m absent-minded because l`m
in love with Sara.

734
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:45,557
Oh, Professor.

735
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:49,388
That doesn`t matter any more,

736
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,234
`cause I don`t get
any more chances with her.

737
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:57,399
That`s not true. There`s always another
chance. I mean, you never know, right?

738
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:59,431
Probably just as well
that it`s over.

739
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:02,956
- Why?
- She has to move on.

740
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:05,600
- Oh.
- I`m not right for her.

741
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:07,790
- But you knew that, didn`t you, Weebo?
- Huh?

742
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:10,514
You never wanted me
to marry her.

743
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:15,509
Well, you were right.
I wasn`t right for her.

744
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:18,518
You`re the one for me, Weebo.

745
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:20,511
Just the two of us.

746
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:23,795
And flubber makes three.

747
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:27,914
- Good night, Weeb.
- Good night.

748
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:31,317
Uh, Professor--

749
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:38,596
And this is the God`s truth:

750
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:41,359
I want him to have
what he wants,

751
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:44,079
even if it means you
instead of me.

752
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:06,191
Ooh!

753
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:21,069
Sara? Sara, it`s me.

754
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,953
- Weebo?
- May I come in?

755
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:26,508
Oh, l`m sorry
to wake you like this,

756
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:30,633
but I can`t ring the doorbell.

757
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:33,075
- Is everything okay with Phillip?
- Oh, yeah.

758
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:35,839
It`s not
a conventional emergency.

759
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:39,635
Oh, Phillip would be very angry
if he knew I left,

760
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:41,955
but I have
to show you something.

761
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:44,435
Do you have a minute?

762
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:46,476
Listen.

763
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:50,519
I know I love her, Weebo.

764
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:54,030
Every neuron in my limbic system
is saturated with phenylethylamine.

765
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:57,789
That triggers euphoria,
elation, exhilaration.

766
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:00,992
Truth is, Weebo, l`m not absent-minded
because l`m selfish...

767
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:04,669
or crazy or-- or inconsiderate.

768
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:08,913
I`m absent-minded because l`m
in love with Sara.

769
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:10,837
Oh.

770
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:18,754
And this will be
our little secret.

771
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,914
Phillip.

772
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:39,431
Oh.

773
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:44,078
- Sara?
- Uh-huh.

774
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:06,951
This is it.
This is the solution.

775
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:10,271
This is how we save the school.

776
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:13,119
That`s what l`ve been saying.
Flubber.

777
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:15,435
- You saw what it did at the game.
- Yes.

778
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:17,351
Imagine the line of shoes
we could develop.

779
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:19,556
Oh, no, no, no, Phillip,
not shoes.

780
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:21,636
No. Look.

781
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:24,115
This. Flight.

782
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:26,554
- Flight?
- Yes.

783
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:28,750
- Oh, of course.
- A-Air travel.

784
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:30,751
Oh, Sara! Air travel.

785
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:32,598
- Yes.
- Oh.

786
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:36,110
- We`d better sell this
to a car company.
- Oh, Phillip.

787
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:53,629
- Hey!
- Dr Reynolds.

788
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:57,150
Professor. It`s a pleasure
to finally meet you.

789
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:00,909
I believe you know my son.

790
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,798
He used to play basketball
for Medfield.

791
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:07,588
Lovely old car.

792
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:10,752
Mind if I take a look
under the hood?

793
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:13,348
Yes, I do.

794
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:17,956
And I don`t appreciate you gentlemen
letting yourselves onto my property.

795
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:22,119
I expected something
more complex.

796
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:25,835
There`s a lot of money
in your discovery.

797
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:28,115
Perhaps we could make a deal.

798
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:32,832
Any discovery I make will belong
to Medfield College.

799
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:35,918
At the end of the term there isn`t
going to be a Medfield College.

800
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,549
- We`ll see about that.
- You could make a lot of money.

801
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:45,468
If we were interested in making money,
we wouldn`t have become teachers.

802
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:48,273
You think you`ll be able to sell
it for what you owe me...

803
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:50,237
by the end of the term?

804
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:52,271
We-- We will.

805
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:56,075
I`ll forget the debt right now.

806
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:59,152
No, l`m not selling.

807
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:02,670
When I leave,
I take my offer with me.

808
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:05,837
We understand.

809
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:07,751
Good luck.

810
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:13,036
Come on.

811
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:14,951
Watch your back, smart guy.

812
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:17,110
Bad move, Professor.

813
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:31,431
Good morning!

814
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:36,756
Pardon me, Mr Seldon.

815
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:39,633
Are you interested in seeing
a Phillip Brainard?

816
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:44,157
- Who?
- He`s the college professor
you spoke to on the sixth...

817
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:46,271
about a brand-new car design.

818
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:49,472
Tell him l`m busy.
Thank him for the interest.

819
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:52,592
- And send him a hat.
- Well, he`s here.

820
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:56,235
He`s right outside.

821
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:16,438
It`s one of the rarest looks
in watches you can actually own.

822
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:18,715
This watch we have here
is called the scarab.

823
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:20,671
It has Swiss--

824
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:24,995
Good night, Weber.

825
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:42,355
What?

826
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:07,151
One goon.

827
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:11,639
Two goons.

828
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:35,957
- Hey.
- What?

829
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:39,077
- I think I found it.
- You found it, all right!

830
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:48,910
- What was that?
- Take two.

831
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:08,752
Knock, knock!

832
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,797
Kiss me, big boy!

833
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:39,953
Did you get it?

834
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:41,877
Yeah.

835
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:56,597
Oh, l-l`ve never seen
so many zeroes.

836
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:59,632
When they saw us flying,
they couldn`t wait to write the cheque.

837
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:02,280
This will save the school,
Phillip.

838
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:20,271
Weebo?

839
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:27,111
Weebo?

840
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:37,034
They took the flubber.

841
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:39,554
Weebo?

842
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:49,755
- Weeb--
- Oh.

843
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:52,440
Um, sh-she`s leaking
battery fluid.

844
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:56,514
Weebo, it`s me.

845
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:03,874
Do you have signal?
Do you have audio signal?

846
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,833
Tracking. It`s me.
Professor Brainard.

847
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:09,912
Focus. Weebo?

848
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:12,429
Can you see me?

849
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:16,673
She sees me.

850
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:21,108
Weebo.

851
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:24,357
It`s all right. I`ve-l`ve-- I need
to get some sort of extension cord,

852
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:27,040
something so I can recharge her.

853
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:29,549
I`ve gotta-- I`ve gotta
download her, quick.

854
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:31,636
Weebo?

855
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:33,995
It`s all right. It`s okay.

856
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:37,390
Weebo, can you hear me?

857
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:43,754
It`s gonna be all right.

858
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:47,628
It`s like that time you ran into
the wall when I first made you.

859
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:50,188
We`ll get you upstairs,
onto AC and--

860
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:54,510
She`s-She`s losing--

861
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:58,991
She`s losing power.
It`s okay. It`s all right.

862
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:01,236
We just gotta get you
to the docking station...

863
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:03,954
till I can make repairs.

864
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:12,997
Weebo?

865
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:19,475
Goodbye, my friend.

866
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:30,993
Gone. I have no idea what--

867
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:34,077
Goodbye.

868
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:57,716
I don`t know what
to do with her.

869
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:03,756
What happens to the soul
of a machine, Sara?

870
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:10,074
Can you fix her?

871
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,634
I can make repairs,

872
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:16,070
but I can never bring back
the life it was she had.

873
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:18,833
That`s gone.

874
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:22,396
I never knew what it was to begin with.
It was some sort of glorious accident.

875
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:27,310
I kept trying to recreate it
and isolate it and find out what it was.

876
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:29,709
I never could.

877
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:34,113
What was that word
she was displaying...

878
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:36,800
on her screen at the end?

879
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:39,388
Probably a file name.

880
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:41,590
Why was she displaying it?

881
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:45,110
She was damaged-- It`s, you know--
download-- random piece of information.

882
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:47,310
- I don`t know.
- What was that word?

883
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:51,475
Oh, can you remember?

884
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,989
No, l--

885
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:56,913
- Try.
- I am.

886
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:04,111
It began with "S."

887
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:15,439
Hello, Phillip. It`s me. Weebo.

888
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:18,080
If I was human, that is.

889
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:21,829
If you`re watching this,
l`m no longer here.

890
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:26,477
I hope my demise didn`t
cause you any undue distress.

891
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:30,030
Phillip,

892
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:33,874
a full and complete design
of me is in this file.

893
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,231
You didn`t forget it.
I never showed it to you.

894
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:40,954
I`ve made a few changes.

895
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:43,833
I`ve removed a few
of my flaws...

896
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:47,589
and added a little of you.

897
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:53,077
I hope you that
you can love my daughter...

898
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:55,316
as much as I loved you.

899
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:34,833
Ooh.

900
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:45,952
Surprise, surprise.

901
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:49,038
Professor Brainard.
Dr Reynolds.

902
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:51,759
Good evening. Sit down.

903
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:56,470
You look, uh--

904
01:14:56,600 --> 01:15:00,388
- Weary.
- Yes. Weary.

905
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:02,596
You came to repay your loan?

906
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:07,157
- No.
- I know you didn`t. I was
just having a little fun.

907
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:09,435
I`m here to sell you
the flubber.

908
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:12,199
You been to your house recently?

909
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:15,915
- Yes.
- Do I really need to buy it?

910
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:19,636
Flubber`s
a very quixotic substance.

911
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:23,958
It`s very difficult to handle.
Have you tried to do anything with it?

912
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:27,709
My man is working on it.
It won`t be a problem.

913
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:31,594
Well, I could make it
a lot easier for you.

914
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:34,069
If you give us a 30-day
extension on the loan,

915
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:36,077
I`ll tell you everything
I know...

916
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:39,038
and make you
a great deal of flubber.

917
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:41,151
I`ll give you the 30 days,

918
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:44,636
and after that
you give me two years.

919
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:48,116
Whatever you come up with
over the next two years is mine.

920
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:50,196
That`s not fair!

921
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:52,714
Shop somewhere else, lady.

922
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:55,633
Sara, Sara. I`ll do it.

923
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:04,039
- May I see the flubber?
- Would you like to show these
good people to the library?

924
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:46,797
You`re going to enjoy this.
Professor?

925
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:51,159
I got you a little help.

926
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:58,040
- The lovebirds.
- Wilson. Shame on you.

927
01:16:58,120 --> 01:17:01,590
- Welcome.
- So you finally gave up teaching.

928
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:06,589
How could I pass up the opportunity
to transform the energy industry?

929
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:10,235
Flubber. Very interesting, Phil.

930
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:12,430
Too bad it`s so unstable.

931
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:16,678
I was just looking over the formula.
Dangerous mix.

932
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:19,792
You just have to know how to
deal with it, really. It just
takes a few simple precautions--

933
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:21,836
Hey, hey. Hang on, "Einsteen."

934
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:24,718
- Stein.
- Whatever.

935
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:32,399
- What`s this?
- Well, it-it`s a hand cream that
acts as a separating agent.

936
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:35,313
- Right.
- Um--

937
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:40,433
It`s so I can handle
the flubber.

938
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:42,829
- It`s okay.
- Thank you.

939
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:47,232
She needs to assist me.
Rub it on your hands.

940
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:56,550
It`s a, uh--

941
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:01,636
squirt gun.

942
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:06,675
- What`s it for?
- I use that to lower
the temperature of the tank.

943
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:08,597
Let him have it.

944
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:15,631
No, no. Give it to him.
N-No, no. Give it to him.

945
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:18,194
W-- Stop that
and give it to him.

946
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:22,318
Put-Put it in his hand
and give it to him.

947
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:26,518
No, no, no, no, no.
Give the gun to him.

948
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:30,068
Oh.

949
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:32,111
- Thank you.
- You`re welcome.

950
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:58,999
You okay? lt`s me.

951
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:07,158
There you go.

952
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:09,350
Oh. Shh.

953
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:19,154
Do it for Weebo.

954
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:21,396
Look out!

955
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,718
Ooh.

956
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:33,511
Get him!

957
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:41,513
- Oh, dear.
- Sara? Going somewhere?

958
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:43,431
Wilson.

959
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:47,312
Ooh.

960
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:55,714
Left, left, left,
right, right, left.

961
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:02,356
- Sara!
- Huh?
- Grab her.

962
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:04,755
- What?
- Jump!

963
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:06,751
I`m coming, Sara!

964
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:08,757
Yo!

965
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:18,835
Ooh!

966
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:25,510
Hey, Lumpy. Hmm?

967
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:27,955
- Come on.
- Let`s go, smart guy.

968
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:38,672
- Ow.
- Phillip, look out!

969
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:51,157
Sara!

970
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:55,915
- Get him.
- This one`s for Weebo.

971
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:10,117
Ooh.

972
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:29,871
Oh, Mommy--

973
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:44,920
Wow.

974
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:56,069
Oh.

975
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:09,477
Beautiful.

976
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:14,238
For as much as these
two people have finally...

977
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:16,874
consented together
in holy wedlock...

978
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:21,238
and have witnessed the same
before God and this company,

979
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:24,557
I pronounce, believe it or not,

980
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:28,315
that they be
husband and wife together.

981
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:31,557
- You may now kiss the video screen.
- Oh.

982
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:41,477
Love you, Sara.

983
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:44,597
I love you.

984
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:53,794
I`ll meet you at the reception. I`m
almost done. It`s gonna be remarkable.

985
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:56,036
Phillip, please be careful.

986
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:59,596
Don`t worry. These chemicals
are completely compatible.

987
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:04,037
There`s no chance
that anything could go wrong!

988
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:23,158
Hey, pal. We`re 30,000 feet
up in the air.

989
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:26,676
There`s no monsters or bad guys
way up here, okay?

990
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:29,075
You can look out the window.

991
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:48,276
Mom. Mom!

992
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:51,796
Flubber`s gone. Get back here!

993
01:23:56,840 --> 01:23:59,308
When we get to the hotel,
I don`t care what you say,

994
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:01,556
I`m not sharing a room with him.

995
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:04,274
Look at him. He`s gross.
He bounces all the time.

996
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:06,516
He squeaks. He phase-shifts.

997
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:08,636
I mean, he`s a quasi-plasmoid.

998
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:10,910
If it`s hot in Hawaii,
I hope he melts.

999
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:17,551
Ow
