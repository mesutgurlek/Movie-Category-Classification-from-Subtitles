there was an island...

2

...some Dutch, some Indians
and some beads.

781
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:59,946
Already had a nervous breakdown.
No, believe me--

782
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,448
He seems to be having a good time now.

783

CARRION:
People think that Spaniards don't work...

784
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:08,663
...that we just take siestas
and drink Rioja and go to the beach.

785
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:12,333
There was a jumbo shrimp free-for-all
at the raw bar.

786

-I'm gonna be-- I'll be right back.
-Okay.

787
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:20,007
Every night before bed,
I am on my knees praying:

788
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:22,385
"Please, God, let it stay up."

789
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:29,559
-Please let what stay up?
-Hi. The stock market.

790
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,228
-This is Carmen Garcia Carrion.
-Carrion.

791
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:33,646
-Carrion.
-Very good.

792
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:36,858
She is the Senior Vice President
of the Bank of Madrid.

793
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:38,651
-Hi.
CARRIE: Hi.

794
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,820
-This is--
-Carrie Preston. Hi.

795
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:44,323
Oh, Carrie Preston. Nice to meet you.
Your husband is very charming.

796
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:45,992
Isn't he?

797
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:50,663
So you were right about the catered food
and the shoving.

798
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:53,249
So I'm ready to go whenever you are.

799
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:55,042
Oh.

800
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:58,129
-Well, nice to meet you both.
-Nice to meet you.

801

MAN 1 [ON TV]:
Is that all you got?

MAN 2: I mean, all we're trying to do is just
keep from getting dead.

Damn!

808
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:23,196
MAN 3: Since the very first Deadliest Catch
cameras rolled seven seasons ago--

809
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:25,239
It's a little loud.

810
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:27,700
--the fleet has gone on
more than 60 voyages.

811
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:34,207
And for the record,
that is not a black-and-white movie.

812
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:35,792
What?

813
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:39,378
That was supposed to be
for black-and-white movies...

814
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:42,256
...and that
is not a black-and-white movie.

815
00:46:44,843 --> 00:46:48,721
When the gay guy hit on me
at the wedding you thought it was funny.

816
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,058
I'm not upset about the flirt.

817
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:56,729
I like the flirt. In fact, you could dial up
the flirt around here a little more.

818
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:59,315
I get TV and take-out guy...

819
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:02,235
...and Bank of Madrid lady,
she gets sparkle guy.

820
00:47:05,864 --> 00:47:08,825
I'm sorry. Are we having a discussion
or watching television?

821
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:11,077
What is it with you and this television?

822
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:13,246
I don't wanna be one of those couples...

823
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:17,458
...lying in bed,
watching television and not talking.

824
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:20,586
That is not the relationship
I signed up for.

825
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:23,631
It's a television,
not the end of the world.

826
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:26,175
Well, maybe to you it's not.

827
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:29,011
The Bering Sea has many faces.

828
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:35,852
You're not happy in,
and you're not happy out.

829
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:39,313
What does that mean?

830
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:41,274
Well, what do you want from me?

831
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:44,068
I put on the shirt, I went to the thing...

832
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:48,072
...and now you're hammering me
about lying in bed and watching a little TV?

833
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,032
I mean, what is the problem?

834
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:57,874
Look...

835
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:01,168
...it's just going to be you and me...

836
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:04,463
...every night, for the rest of our lives.

837
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:07,633
And I think that we are going...

838
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:10,303
...to have to work on the sparkle...

839
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:12,471
...for the rest of our lives.

840
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:14,974
Sparkle.

841
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:16,475
Got it.

842
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:29,405
Listen to that!

When it starts really screaming, the waves
stack up, and you've got these big, nasty--

You are the most important person

If you don't do it, who will?

849

Juicing is the easy way to help save
your life. And I guarantee it.

MAN 1:
So don't delay. Drink yourself healthy.

Start enjoying the benefits of fresh,

Order your Jack LaLanne
Power Juicer now.

853

CARRIE: The last two years
weren't exactly the best time...

854
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:39,100
...to put an apartment on the market.

855
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:40,643
So we didn't.

856
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,562
And from time to time,
I'd come here to write.

857
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,569
Or to visit the clothes.

[PHONE RINGS]

859
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:08,129
-Hello?
-What time did you wake up?

860
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:10,631
I don't know, about 6.

861
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:15,803
I'm worried about the Vogue article,
so I wanted to get started.

862
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:18,014
You haven't written over there in a while.

863
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:20,099
Yeah, I know. I know. I just--

864
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:23,769
I don't know, I thought it would be easier
to work here. No distractions.

865
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:26,439
-Okay.
-Anyway, it's due Thursday...

866
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:30,109
...and I'm not even sure
what I'm writing yet, so, um....

867
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:32,611
Maybe I should just stay here
until I get it done.

868
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:34,405
You're going to stay there?

869
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:36,949
Just two days.
You know, just to bang it out.

-Is that all right?
-Whatever you need.

-Everything okay?
-Yeah.

872
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:46,333
No, I just feel like I really need
to lock myself in a room...

873
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:51,297
...and not think about anything
but writing.

874
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:52,840
Okay?

875
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,300
Okay.

-Okay.
-Bye.

Bye.

879
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:04,894
And I did think about nothing but writing.

880
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:08,564
Until the next day, when I could think
about nothing but food.

881
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:12,234
And as long as I was going to break
to eat anyway, I thought:

882
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:13,819
"Why not call the girls?"

883
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:16,238
One week in Abu Dhabi,
all expenses paid.

884
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:20,659
I've always been fascinated by
the Middle East. You know, desert moons...

885
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:23,621
...Scheherazade, magic carpets.

886

-Like Jasmine in Aladdin?
-Yes, sweetie, just like Jasmine.

887
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:29,835
But with cocktails.

888
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:35,716
-It is exciting. When are you gonna go?
-I don't know. When can you all be free?

889
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:39,845
You didn't think I was going
without my gals.

890
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:42,348
-What?
-I told the sheikh I'd go on one condition:

891
00:51:42,682 --> 00:51:45,017
I'd get to bring my three best girlfriends.

892
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:46,977
-Get out of town.
-My point exactly.

893
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:50,564
And we are being flown
on the sheikh's own airline.

894
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:52,525
-He has his own airline?
-Mm-hm.

895
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:56,529
-Oh, that is one chic sheikh.
SAMANTHA: Super, super, super first class.

-Oh, my God.
SAMANTHA: All expenses paid for...

...everything for all of us.
All we have to do is pick the week.

899
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:08,374
And the sooner, the better.
I can hear the decadence calling.

Let me just check my work schedule.
Yeah. All clear.

901

I gotta check with the old ball and chain,
but I'm good to go. Middle East me.

We have to go this month. Next month,
it gets so hot, you burst into flames.

Yes, yes, but you have a husband.

909
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:35,067
And a full-time nanny. You said so yourself.

00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:11,538
I missed you.

934
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:14,124
I missed you.

935

We had a wonderful dinner out.

936
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:23,926
And back at home...

937
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:28,389
...the television stayed off
the entire night.

938
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:36,188
And pretty soon,
the Middle East was upon us.

939
00:54:36,564 --> 00:54:38,649

-One more to go.

00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:46,532
I had an idea I wanted
to talk to you about.

942
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:50,077
Remember when you took those
two days away to finish your article...

943
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:53,163
-...and then we had that great night?
-Mm-hm.

944
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:55,582
Maybe we should think
about doing that every week.

Hear me out.

946

After you took those two days
at your old apartment, I started thinking:

947
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:05,551
What if I got a place?

948
00:55:06,219 --> 00:55:10,139
-You want your own apartment?
-No, not my own apartment.

949
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:12,766
Just a place that I can go
two days a week...

950

...lie around, watch television,
do the shit I wanna do that bugs you.

951
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,230
And then the other five days...

952
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:23,235
...I'd be here and available
for dinners and sparkle or whatever.

953
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:28,407
So you're telling me that you want
two days off a week from our marriage.

954
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:30,451
And you'd have the same two days.

958
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:39,585
But I don't wanna do things without you.

Can you honestly tell me you didn't enjoy
those two days to yourself?

961
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:49,470
Two days, yes,
but I don't need it every week.

962

Are you saying you need it every week?

963
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:57,269
I don't know, it was just an idea.
Something to think about.

964
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:00,814
Marriage doesn't work like that.

965
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:04,818
I thought we were supposed to be
making up our own rules.

966
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:15,245
So two days, then four days,
then what, no days?

-Is that where this is heading?
-I never would've brought it up if I thought...

a little easier for us to live together.

Well, something is.

"Big and I are taking two days a week off...

1240
01:13:16,308 --> 01:13:17,809
You did not dismiss me.

1241
01:13:17,976 --> 01:13:21,187
Oh. I was supposed to do that?

1242
01:13:22,022 --> 01:13:23,648
Oh.

1243
01:13:23,816 --> 01:13:25,483
I'm sorry, Gaurau, I didn't know.

1244
01:13:25,651 --> 01:13:28,528
It is my pleasure. What can I do for you?

1245
01:13:28,695 --> 01:13:32,115
Nothing, I was just gonna warm
some milk up, but you go, go home.

1246
01:13:32,282 --> 01:13:34,367
No, no, allow me, please. I insist.

1247
01:13:36,787 --> 01:13:37,870
I will bring it to you.

1248

Oh, you don't have to. I'll wait.

1249
01:13:50,175 --> 01:13:53,886
If you will permit me,
might I suggest a touch of cinnamon?

1250
01:13:54,805 --> 01:13:56,556
It is a secret learned from my wife.

1251
01:13:58,183 --> 01:14:02,228
Well, please apologize to your wife
for my keeping you here all night.

1252
01:14:02,396 --> 01:14:04,522
It is fine. She is in India.

CARRIE:
Oh.

I will see her in one month.

1255
01:14:08,152 --> 01:14:11,696
I'm afraid if I apologize then,
it will hardly make sense.

1256
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:17,034
So you work here
and you travel back and forth?

1257
01:14:17,202 --> 01:14:22,623
Yes. Every three months, when I have a
break in work and can afford the plane fare.

1258
01:14:25,711 --> 01:14:26,878
Isn’t that hard?

1259
01:14:28,046 --> 01:14:29,213
What, miss?

1260
01:14:29,548 --> 01:14:33,634
Just, you know, being married
and spending all that time apart.

1261
01:14:36,221 --> 01:14:38,181
Time does not matter.

1262
01:14:38,348 --> 01:14:41,893
When we see each other, each time...

1263
01:14:42,561 --> 01:14:43,644
...it is very wonderful.

1264
01:14:45,939 --> 01:14:48,065
I'm a lucky man.

1265
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:57,783
Okay, now I'm gonna try
one of these little date confections.

1266
01:15:05,584 --> 01:15:07,627
I think my butler's gay.

1267
01:15:07,794 --> 01:15:10,505
-First, he's way too cute.
-That's genetics.

1268
01:15:10,672 --> 01:15:13,591
I asked about his dating life
and he said it was private.

1269
01:15:13,759 --> 01:15:15,134
That's appropriate.

1270
01:15:15,302 --> 01:15:18,262
When I asked how to pronounce
his name he said:

1271
01:15:18,430 --> 01:15:20,765
"Abdul. Like Paula."

1272
01:15:20,933 --> 01:15:23,976
-And that's gay.
-Yeah.

1273
01:15:24,144 --> 01:15:26,103
-Morning.
MIRANDA: Morning.

1274
01:15:26,271 --> 01:15:27,939
-Morning.
-How'd you sleep?

1275
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:29,941
All right.

1276
01:15:31,652 --> 01:15:33,778
-Samantha, what are you eating?
-Mm. Hummus.

1277
01:15:34,404 --> 01:15:38,449
I read online that chickpeas are high
in natural estrogen.

1278
01:15:38,617 --> 01:15:41,452
So are yams.
Paula Abdul's getting me some later.

1279
01:15:42,329 --> 01:15:44,205
Is she here too?

1280
01:15:45,374 --> 01:15:49,126
Good morning, miss.
What can we bring you for breakfast?

1281
01:15:49,628 --> 01:15:51,128
Just some fruit, please.

1282
01:15:51,296 --> 01:15:53,047
Thank you.

1283
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:56,175
He is so nice. What's his name again?

1284
01:15:56,343 --> 01:15:57,718
Gaurau.

1285
01:15:57,886 --> 01:16:01,472
He's from India.
His wife still lives there.

1286
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:04,976
They only see each other once
every three months when they can afford it.

1287
01:16:05,143 --> 01:16:09,313
And I asked him if that was hard
for them and he said:

1288
01:16:09,481 --> 01:16:11,107
"Time doesn't matter."

1289
01:16:11,275 --> 01:16:15,152
That each time they see each other
it's wonderful.

1290
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:18,823
So, see, there are all kinds
of marriages.

1291

Who's up for a morning trip
to the souk in Old Abu Dhabi?

1292
01:16:30,085 --> 01:16:31,127
What's a souk?

1293
01:16:31,295 --> 01:16:34,380
It's a market where you can buy
gold, spices...

1294
01:16:34,673 --> 01:16:36,507
...textiles and souk things.

1295
01:16:36,675 --> 01:16:39,176
I'm in. One sip then souk.

Oh, okay.

1302

Men may approach you
with black-market wristwatches.

1303
01:17:06,246 --> 01:17:10,374
If you engage them, they'll move you to a
room and try to sell you items. It is illegal.

1304
01:17:10,542 --> 01:17:14,503
Other than that, you'll not have to worry.
People here are very honest.

Allow me to properly introduce myself.
My name is Rikard Spirt.

Yeah, my wife showed me something
on the internet.

You know, she always kind of kept
one eye on you, the one that got away.

1797

Abu Dhabi is so cutting-edge
in so many ways...

01:56:08,920 --> 01:56:10,963
I'm her attorney. I'm gonna stay.

1863
01:56:11,547 --> 01:56:13,048
-Sure.
-We'll be right outside.

1864
01:56:18,972 --> 01:56:24,226
-It's all right.
-So, what is the severity of the situation?

1865
01:56:26,187 --> 01:56:30,065
The gentleman who reported the incident
is very conservative...

1866
01:56:30,233 --> 01:56:33,735
...and has insisted the offending event
be recorded.

1867
01:56:34,195 --> 01:56:37,114
Offending event? It was kissing.

1868
01:56:37,281 --> 01:56:40,242
I understand your feelings.
But we will need your passport.

1869
01:56:40,410 --> 01:56:43,286
My passport? You gotta be kidding me.

1870
01:56:43,454 --> 01:56:46,915
It's just to make a record.
To satisfy the complaining gentleman.

1871
01:56:49,836 --> 01:56:52,421
This is outrageous.

1872
01:56:52,588 --> 01:56:53,588
I know. I know.

1873
01:56:54,757 --> 01:56:57,092
It was just a kiss.

1874
01:56:57,844 --> 01:56:59,428
Thank you.

1875
01:57:13,276 --> 01:57:15,277
I guess I really missed who I used to be...

1876
01:57:15,445 --> 01:57:18,989
...and Aidan was such a big part
of that and--

1877
01:57:19,407 --> 01:57:22,200
Yes, I wanted the flirting,
and, yes, I wanted the attention.

1878
01:57:22,368 --> 01:57:23,994
But I didn't want the kiss.

1879
01:57:24,162 --> 01:57:26,788
The minute I kissed Aidan
I remembered who I used to be.

1880
01:57:26,956 --> 01:57:31,293
Someone just running around New York
like a crazy person...

1881
01:57:31,961 --> 01:57:34,504
...trying to get the one man I loved
to love me back.

1882
01:57:36,174 --> 01:57:37,507
And now he does love me...

1883
01:57:37,675 --> 01:57:42,471
...and he wants to sit on a couch
in New York City with me.

1884
01:57:46,350 --> 01:57:50,020
And I really hope my past hasn't
screwed up my future.

1885
01:57:52,440 --> 01:57:54,399
And what's so bad
about a couch anyway?

1886
01:57:58,237 --> 01:58:01,531
Oh, my God. I'm having a mid-wife crisis.

1887
01:58:06,454 --> 01:58:09,664
I should never have said anything to him.

1888
01:58:09,832 --> 01:58:13,919
The New Yorker was right to slap
a big piece of tape across my mouth.

1889
01:58:17,965 --> 01:58:21,551
And I'm sorry for that thing I said
about your marriage earlier.

1890
01:58:21,928 --> 01:58:23,345
I'm sorry too.

1891
01:58:23,513 --> 01:58:25,263
For what?

1892
01:58:25,765 --> 01:58:29,184
For having an attitude
about that two-day idea.

1893
01:58:30,019 --> 01:58:33,230
I've had two days away,
I've gotten a little sleep...

1894
01:58:33,397 --> 01:58:37,025
...and I am finally starting
to feel like myself again.

1895
01:58:37,193 --> 01:58:40,112
I think there's really something to it.

1896

Maybe.

1897
01:58:46,327 --> 01:58:49,663
Well, let's just hope Big
doesn't want seven days off.

Beydoun, there must be some mistake.

I am a guest of Sheikh Khalid.
There is no room charge.

Yes, I have a record of that.
But not from today on.

02:16:05,824 --> 02:16:07,449
Vows.

2168
02:16:08,201 --> 02:16:11,370
I took the liberty of making up
some vows for you.

2169
02:16:11,538 --> 02:16:14,248
Repeat after me, please.

2170
02:16:14,416 --> 02:16:17,334
I will never kiss another man other
than my husband.

2171
02:16:17,502 --> 02:16:20,254
I will never kiss another man other
than my husband.

2172
02:16:20,422 --> 02:16:23,382
I will stop worrying
about being a boring old married couple...

2173
02:16:23,550 --> 02:16:25,926
...because we never will be.

2174
02:16:26,094 --> 02:16:30,181
I will stop worrying

...because we never will be.

Are you sure?

2177
02:16:35,687 --> 02:16:38,230
It's gonna be just us two.

2178
02:16:39,608 --> 02:16:41,025
Are we enough?

2179

Kid...

2180
02:16:44,279 --> 02:16:45,779
...we're too much.

2181
02:16:50,952 --> 02:16:52,536
How's that for a little sparkle?

2182
02:16:54,080 --> 02:16:56,457
That's a lot of sparkle.

2183
02:16:59,336 --> 02:17:01,462
Why'd you get a black diamond?

2184
02:17:01,880 --> 02:17:04,298
Because you're not like anyone else.

2185
02:17:05,592 --> 02:17:07,009
That's a relief.

2186
02:17:07,177 --> 02:17:10,763
I thought you were gonna say
it's the color of my soul.

2187
02:17:15,727 --> 02:17:19,980
And, like it always will,
time moved us on.

MIRANDA: I am proud to report
that the settlement we attained...

2190
02:17:25,570 --> 02:17:28,781
...for Global Families Incorporated
surpassed their expectations.

2191
02:17:28,949 --> 02:17:33,661
--Miranda learned that at the right law firm,
where her voice was valued...

2192
02:17:33,828 --> 02:17:37,039
...she was also fun at work.

2193
02:17:38,917 --> 02:17:43,045
And that July 4th,
on an East Hampton sand dune...

2194
02:17:44,381 --> 02:17:48,509
...Samantha learned that good things
do come to those who wait...

2195
02:17:48,677 --> 02:17:54,515
...when she and Rikard
resumed their date in the land of the free...

And Charlotte learned that she never
really had anything to worry about.

2199
02:18:09,656 --> 02:18:15,202
Turns out, her hot nanny preferred
the company of other hot nannies.

SAMANTHA: Stanford, here's a refresher.
-Yes, please.

2201
02:18:17,622 --> 02:18:20,833
-Happy birthday.
-What are you doing? You drank it all?

2202
02:18:21,001 --> 02:18:23,043
And as Rose turned 3...

2203
02:18:27,507 --> 02:18:31,135
...and our marriage grew out
of the terrible twos...

2204
02:18:31,303 --> 02:18:36,223
...Big and I found less and less need
to escape to the other apartment.

2205
02:18:39,936 --> 02:18:42,771
But we kept the option open.

2206
02:18:42,939 --> 02:18:46,400
Just in case someone
needed those two days off.

2207
02:19:02,375 --> 02:19:04,793
As for me, I began to think of marriage...

2208
02:19:04,961 --> 02:19:08,756
...much like the Real Housewife
of Abu Dhabi's veil.

You have to take the tradition

-Never take a stubborn woman...
