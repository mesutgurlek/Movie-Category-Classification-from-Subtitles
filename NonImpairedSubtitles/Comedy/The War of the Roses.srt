1
00:02:16,853 --> 00:02:20,243
Do you have some valid reasons
for wanting a divorce?

2
00:02:23,693 --> 00:02:25,684
Excuse me.

3
00:02:26,493 --> 00:02:29,246
My sinuses are very sensitive to irritants.

4
00:02:33,973 --> 00:02:36,567
ln the past five months,

5
00:02:36,653 --> 00:02:41,681
l think l've breathed freely,
with both sides working, maybe a week total.

6
00:02:41,773 --> 00:02:45,243
l gotta cut this out. lt's gonna kill me.

7
00:02:51,493 --> 00:02:53,961
l hadn't smoked for 13 years.

8
00:02:56,133 --> 00:02:58,806
l kept the last cigarette from my last pack.

9
00:03:00,173 --> 00:03:03,245
l said if l never smoke this one cigarette

10
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,642
l'll never smoke again, period.

11
00:03:06,933 --> 00:03:09,447
13 years l kept that cigarette.

12
00:03:11,093 --> 00:03:13,084
Here.

13
00:03:15,773 --> 00:03:18,412
l had this little case made for it.

14
00:03:18,493 --> 00:03:20,484
See?

15
00:03:23,693 --> 00:03:25,684
13 years.

16
00:03:27,933 --> 00:03:30,766
And then, one Thursday afternoon,

17
00:03:32,133 --> 00:03:34,124
Barbara came to see me.

18
00:03:35,613 --> 00:03:38,605
And when she left...

19
00:03:42,373 --> 00:03:44,967
You know where l am
if you change your mind.

20
00:03:57,853 --> 00:04:00,083
Barbara and Oliver Rose.

21
00:04:01,933 --> 00:04:06,723
You'd have heard of 'em, except l kept
what happened out ofthe papers.

22
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:10,647
l think you should hear the story, though.
lt might matter to you.

23
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:13,406
l won't start the clock yet.

24
00:04:13,493 --> 00:04:16,053
My fee is $450 an hour.

25
00:04:16,133 --> 00:04:20,843
When a man who makes $450 an hour
wants to tell you something for free,

26
00:04:20,933 --> 00:04:23,208
you should listen.

27
00:04:25,973 --> 00:04:28,692
They met... Great.

28
00:04:28,773 --> 00:04:30,684
They agreed on that.

29
00:04:30,773 --> 00:04:35,403
But, the way l saw it,
the poor bastards never had a chance.

30
00:04:38,413 --> 00:04:41,689
lt was the final day of
the season in Nantucket.

31
00:04:43,573 --> 00:04:47,202
A nor'easter was blowing the last
of the tourists offthe island.

32
00:05:45,613 --> 00:05:51,245
The next item up for bid is an exquisite
Japanese carving, circa 1700.

33
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:55,485
A rare relief of a Shinto goddess,
very richly detailed.

34
00:05:55,573 --> 00:05:58,212
- The intricacies ofthe Orient...
- $10!

35
00:05:58,293 --> 00:06:01,410
l have $10 from the premature young man
in the grey raincoat.

36
00:06:01,973 --> 00:06:03,770
- Do l hear 15?
- 11.

37
00:06:03,853 --> 00:06:07,084
$11. Ladies and gentlemen,
please, do l hear 15?

38
00:06:07,173 --> 00:06:11,610
- 20.
- $20. l have $20, ladies and gentlemen.

39
00:06:11,693 --> 00:06:14,844
Do l hear 25 for this
exceptionally exotic item?

40
00:06:14,933 --> 00:06:17,242
- $30.
- 31.

41
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:22,487
$31. All right, l have $31, ladies and
gentlemen. ls this my final offer?

42
00:06:22,573 --> 00:06:24,609
Ladies and gentlemen, 31, going once...

43
00:06:24,693 --> 00:06:28,891
- $40.
- $40! 40. Do l hear 45?

44
00:06:28,973 --> 00:06:33,683
- 50. Five-0.
- $50. l have $50. Do l hear 60?

45
00:06:34,493 --> 00:06:38,008
$50, going once. Going twice.

46
00:06:38,093 --> 00:06:41,369
Sold... to the pretty lady in the white sweater.

47
00:06:44,013 --> 00:06:47,403
- Do you know how much it's worth?
- Doesn't matter. l'm not selling.

48
00:06:47,493 --> 00:06:49,484
$250.

49
00:06:50,573 --> 00:06:52,564
Well, l guess l have a good eye.

50
00:06:52,653 --> 00:06:54,644
l gotta catch the last ferry.

51
00:06:54,733 --> 00:06:58,089
Wait a minute. Let me carry that for you.
Here. Put this on.

52
00:07:00,133 --> 00:07:03,125
- l love the rain.
- God, l love it, too.

53
00:07:05,973 --> 00:07:10,205
l know what you're thinking. Harvard Law,
woo, woo, woo! But l got a scholarship.

54
00:07:10,853 --> 00:07:13,606
l'm not rich or anything. l'm brilliant.

55
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:16,008
- What about you?
- l'm not rich or brilliant.

56
00:07:16,093 --> 00:07:19,847
- Where are you going to school?
- Madison. l got a scholarship. Gymnastics.

57
00:07:19,933 --> 00:07:22,891
l don't know, though.
My body's getting kinda big.

58
00:07:22,973 --> 00:07:24,770
lt looks, uh...

59
00:07:24,853 --> 00:07:27,606
Like a pendulum -
the longer it is, the slower you move.

60
00:07:27,693 --> 00:07:31,447
My vaults and tumbling aren't what
they were. My strength moves are good.

61
00:07:31,533 --> 00:07:33,922
Your strength moves?

62
00:07:43,413 --> 00:07:45,802
l love Nantucket.

63
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:50,084
Oh! l'm gonna miss the ferry.

64
00:07:51,853 --> 00:07:54,765
- Thanks for walking me. Bye.
- Wait! What's your name?

65
00:07:55,533 --> 00:07:57,524
Barbara!

66
00:07:58,733 --> 00:08:01,293
Barbara!

67
00:08:01,373 --> 00:08:03,887
Wait a second! l've got a great idea!

68
00:08:17,493 --> 00:08:19,723
l'm sorry! l'm sorry!

69
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:24,162
Never, never, never apologise
for being multiorgasmic.

70
00:08:25,253 --> 00:08:27,892
l honestly didn't know l was.

71
00:08:29,093 --> 00:08:31,084
Oh, bless you!

72
00:08:34,693 --> 00:08:36,684
Bless you.

73
00:08:46,253 --> 00:08:48,608
lf we end up together,

74
00:08:48,693 --> 00:08:52,402
then this is the most romantic day
of my whole life.

75
00:08:53,573 --> 00:08:55,803
And ifwe don't,

76
00:08:55,893 --> 00:08:57,884
then l'm a complete slut.

77
00:09:04,493 --> 00:09:07,849
This is the story
we're gonna tell our grandchildren.

78
00:09:26,293 --> 00:09:30,252
lt's the return ofthe bald avenger.

79
00:09:56,693 --> 00:09:59,890
OK, that's the sixth time.
Now turn it off, honey.

80
00:09:59,973 --> 00:10:02,043
Merry Christmas, Bird.

81
00:10:10,613 --> 00:10:14,322
- Honey, give me those papers.
- Say please.

82
00:10:16,293 --> 00:10:18,488
- Please.
- No.

83
00:10:26,653 --> 00:10:29,804
- Where are they?
- l don't got.

84
00:10:40,493 --> 00:10:42,882
- Nice try.
- Thanks.

85
00:10:48,853 --> 00:10:52,289
Hello! Mom's home!

86
00:10:52,373 --> 00:10:55,729
Get over here, you squeezy! Squozy!

87
00:10:55,813 --> 00:10:58,088
Ohh, up we go!

88
00:10:58,173 --> 00:10:59,572
Come on, you.

89
00:11:02,053 --> 00:11:03,532
Hi, honey.

90
00:11:03,613 --> 00:11:06,081
Yeah, now you go in that chair. Got it?

91
00:11:06,173 --> 00:11:09,085
Well, you're gonna go in this one, lady.

92
00:11:11,453 --> 00:11:13,523
- l got you...
- ls that for me?

93
00:11:13,613 --> 00:11:15,922
- There's green for you.
- Oh, thanks.

94
00:11:16,013 --> 00:11:18,243
And it's red for you.

95
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:21,530
- lt's not a good idea to give them sweets.
- Oh, no. lt is.

96
00:11:21,613 --> 00:11:25,526
l read that kids who are deprived
of sweets and candies all the time,

97
00:11:25,613 --> 00:11:28,411
they get obsessed by it
and they turn out to be obese.

98
00:11:28,493 --> 00:11:31,803
Kids who get it all the time,
it's no big deal - they turn out normal.

99
00:11:31,893 --> 00:11:33,690
And... here.

100
00:11:33,773 --> 00:11:37,448
Being a waitress on Christmas Eve's
very profitable.

101
00:11:38,933 --> 00:11:41,766
- What do you think, guys?
- Ah! Nice!

102
00:11:41,853 --> 00:11:43,844
OK.

103
00:11:45,373 --> 00:11:48,649
l have to put it on the tree! Josh, look!

104
00:11:52,053 --> 00:11:54,044
What do you think?

105
00:11:57,173 --> 00:12:00,643
- Looks like tin foil.
- No, you're right. lt doesn't make it.

106
00:12:00,733 --> 00:12:02,724
l'll learn.

107
00:12:03,693 --> 00:12:05,923
- Let's go for a walk.
- l gotta finish this.

108
00:12:06,013 --> 00:12:09,608
- Just a quick stroll. Come on.
- lt's freezing outside. lt's snowing.

109
00:12:09,693 --> 00:12:12,332
Yes. And l'm still asking you to take a walk.

110
00:12:12,413 --> 00:12:14,244
Why? Huh?

111
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,403
- Where are we going?
- Just to the corner.

112
00:12:16,493 --> 00:12:20,725
Barbara, l have work to do.
l can't be walking around here in the snow.

113
00:12:23,813 --> 00:12:27,442
OK, we're at the corner.
So what do you wanna do now? Walk back?

114
00:12:27,533 --> 00:12:31,242
- No, l wanna go for a ride in your car.
- l don't have a car.

115
00:12:35,933 --> 00:12:37,651
- You got me a Morgan?
- Yes!

116
00:12:39,373 --> 00:12:43,082
l don't believe it! A Morgan! A Morgan!

117
00:12:43,173 --> 00:12:47,724
- The cook's brother brought it from England.
- lt's got a little rust. l'll restore it.

118
00:12:47,813 --> 00:12:50,407
- How much you pay?
- lt's a present. l used my money.

119
00:12:50,493 --> 00:12:52,768
Your money is our money.
Can we afford this?

120
00:12:52,853 --> 00:12:57,290
You are gonna be so successful, this may be
our last opportunity to worry about money.

121
00:12:57,373 --> 00:13:01,446
Come on! Here. Get in.
lt's a right-hand drive.

122
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:06,087
- Well, are you happy?
- l'm more than happy. l'm way past happy.

123
00:13:06,173 --> 00:13:08,164
l'm married.

124
00:13:25,773 --> 00:13:28,890
Sounds like a fairy tale, doesn't it?

125
00:13:28,973 --> 00:13:30,964
And it was.

126
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:37,643
My father used to say: ''There are four things
that tell the world who a man is.''

127
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:41,772
''His house, his car, his wife, and his shoes.''

128
00:13:42,733 --> 00:13:46,965
Oliver didn't have the house yet,
but he was definitely moving up in the world.

129
00:13:47,053 --> 00:13:49,408
He'd only been with the firm six months

130
00:13:49,493 --> 00:13:53,611
when he decided to have the senior partners
over to his new apartment for dinner.

131
00:13:53,693 --> 00:13:56,082
He had his eye on the future.

132
00:13:56,173 --> 00:13:57,925
So did l.

133
00:14:10,693 --> 00:14:12,684
Ah, what a night!

134
00:14:13,973 --> 00:14:16,168
Elke, Elke. Wait a minute.

135
00:14:16,253 --> 00:14:19,245
We're eating with elderly people now.
Keep that closed.

136
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,972
- Where you been? Come on!
- Oliver, this is Elke.

137
00:14:22,053 --> 00:14:23,725
- Elke, this is Oliver.
- Hi.

138
00:14:23,813 --> 00:14:25,565
Come on. Come on.

139
00:14:25,653 --> 00:14:28,406
Here is to Oliver and Gavin

140
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:31,963
for ajob well done
on Kentuckyversus Brunswick Coal.

141
00:14:32,053 --> 00:14:33,042
Hear, hear!

142
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:35,203
- Hell of a litigation.
- Thank you.

143
00:14:35,293 --> 00:14:37,443
l couldn't have done it without you, Oliver.

144
00:14:37,533 --> 00:14:40,923
This man has a face
juries can't help but believe.

145
00:14:41,893 --> 00:14:45,442
Gavin told the state attorney general
that if he didn't settle,

146
00:14:45,533 --> 00:14:47,967
next election he'd be running as a gelding.

147
00:14:49,893 --> 00:14:52,123
Well, let's drink up.

148
00:14:54,413 --> 00:14:56,290
Good night, Mom.

149
00:14:56,373 --> 00:14:57,965
Good night, sweethearts.

150
00:14:58,053 --> 00:14:59,486
- Mom?
- Yeah?

151
00:14:59,573 --> 00:15:01,768
Can l take some more dessert to our room?

152
00:15:01,853 --> 00:15:04,048
OK! Time for bed. Let's go.

153
00:15:04,133 --> 00:15:07,489
- Guess not.
- Kiss... Kiss.

154
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,609
Kiss Daddy.

155
00:15:09,693 --> 00:15:12,127
- Good night, sweetheart.
- Good night.

156
00:15:12,693 --> 00:15:14,809
- Good night, buddy.
- Good night, Dad.

157
00:15:14,893 --> 00:15:16,451
Sleep well.

158
00:15:19,173 --> 00:15:21,528
l used to be chubby as a kid. Yeah.

159
00:15:21,613 --> 00:15:23,012
Let's eat.

160
00:15:32,613 --> 00:15:34,968
Oh, my!

161
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,324
Whatever flavour is this?

162
00:15:38,093 --> 00:15:42,609
No, don't tell me. Let me think now. Uh...

163
00:15:43,733 --> 00:15:47,043
- lt isn't apples.
- You make something with apples.

164
00:15:47,133 --> 00:15:49,852
- No. Unless you mean baked apples?
- Prunes?

165
00:15:49,933 --> 00:15:53,846
No. Wait a minute.
This is a very special taste...

166
00:15:53,933 --> 00:15:56,925
- Raisins!
- lt isn't pears.

167
00:15:59,413 --> 00:16:03,691
Um... fresh fig with, uh... a little cognac.

168
00:16:04,133 --> 00:16:10,129
- Figs! l never would have thought offigs!
- l never would have guessed.

169
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,608
lt's fantastic, isn't it, Elke?

170
00:16:14,693 --> 00:16:16,888
lt's absolutely spectacular.

171
00:16:16,973 --> 00:16:20,204
- Mrs Marshall, more wine?
- Please.

172
00:16:20,973 --> 00:16:23,168
- Your crystal is lovely.
- Thank you.

173
00:16:23,253 --> 00:16:25,448
- lt's not Waterford.
- Baccarat.

174
00:16:27,693 --> 00:16:29,923
Then we are paying our associates too much!

175
00:16:32,813 --> 00:16:35,008
Actually, we got it quite reasonably.

176
00:16:35,093 --> 00:16:38,165
lt's... lt's kind of an interesting story.

177
00:16:38,893 --> 00:16:41,361
Why don't you tell it, Barb?

178
00:16:51,653 --> 00:16:54,042
Well... we were in Paris...

179
00:16:54,373 --> 00:16:56,364
lt was our fifth anniversary.

180
00:16:57,813 --> 00:17:02,648
We'd had lunch in this wonderful place in
the market district, called the Pa-day Crishon.

181
00:17:02,733 --> 00:17:05,247
- Pied de Cochon.
- Thanks.

182
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:08,928
We were wandering around
and we came upon the...

183
00:17:09,373 --> 00:17:11,967
Rue de Paradis,

184
00:17:12,053 --> 00:17:15,409
where the Baccarat
has its factory and museum.

185
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:18,132
l didn't know about this before l met Oliver.

186
00:17:18,573 --> 00:17:21,007
My mother bought her glasses at the A&P.

187
00:17:21,093 --> 00:17:25,371
You know, the kind with the raised flowers
that always chipped off after a few weeks.

188
00:17:25,453 --> 00:17:28,013
They were always yellow, remember?

189
00:17:28,093 --> 00:17:32,848
Anyway, here we were in this immense room
filled with all that Baccarat had ever made.

190
00:17:32,933 --> 00:17:37,882
A field of crystal. lt was so... so pretty.

191
00:17:38,253 --> 00:17:40,244
l mean, l felt...

192
00:17:42,573 --> 00:17:44,609
whatever the word.

193
00:17:44,693 --> 00:17:48,208
And suddenly, from the next room,
we heard the sound of glass breaking.

194
00:17:48,293 --> 00:17:52,889
Well, l looked at Oliver and Oliver
looked at me, and then... Oh... No.

195
00:17:52,973 --> 00:17:55,851
Before that,
there was this big, black limousine.

196
00:17:55,933 --> 00:17:58,845
Now, this is important.
Well, before the limousine...

197
00:17:58,933 --> 00:18:03,006
To make a long story short, a couple
had ordered a design for their anniversary.

198
00:18:03,093 --> 00:18:05,482
When it was ready,
they were getting a divorce.

199
00:18:05,573 --> 00:18:07,450
The woman had smashed her half,

200
00:18:07,533 --> 00:18:11,082
and l convinced the man to sell us
his half cheap -just to spite her.

201
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:19,326
And, uh... that's our Baccarat story.

202
00:18:29,933 --> 00:18:32,811
Well, l think everybody
had a great time, don't you?

203
00:18:32,893 --> 00:18:37,921
- To make a long story short, no.
- l'm sorry. You were just rambling on...

204
00:18:38,013 --> 00:18:41,926
Tell your own story next time you care
so desperately what everybody thinks.

205
00:18:42,013 --> 00:18:44,004
Fuckface!

206
00:18:45,173 --> 00:18:47,812
- They're my bosses.
- They're Gavin's bosses, too.

207
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:50,487
lt didn't stop him from getting
a footjob at dinner.

208
00:18:50,573 --> 00:18:55,408
Gavin doesn't care about making partner.
He doesn't have a wife and kids. l do.

209
00:18:57,933 --> 00:19:00,083
You wanna keep living in this apartment?

210
00:19:00,173 --> 00:19:03,688
Because you do not buy a house
on an associate's salary.

211
00:19:03,773 --> 00:19:06,685
At least, not the kind of house that we want.

212
00:19:06,773 --> 00:19:10,402
OK, l care what they think.
l care, all right? l care.

213
00:19:11,493 --> 00:19:13,449
Shoot me.

214
00:19:13,533 --> 00:19:15,888
And that phoney laugh.

215
00:19:17,613 --> 00:19:19,922
That was a genuine laugh.

216
00:19:21,613 --> 00:19:24,411
All right, all right! Maybe l overdid it.

217
00:19:24,493 --> 00:19:27,246
l was just trying to keep things going.

218
00:19:34,733 --> 00:19:38,043
God, l hope they didn't notice
what ajerk l am.

219
00:19:39,253 --> 00:19:41,687
They never seem to.

220
00:19:49,613 --> 00:19:51,604
''Dear Homeowner,

221
00:19:51,693 --> 00:19:54,161
l love your house!''

222
00:19:54,253 --> 00:20:00,203
''lf you ever consider selling,
please... contact me.''

223
00:20:00,293 --> 00:20:02,011
''Barbara Rose.''

224
00:20:02,093 --> 00:20:05,688
Mom! l'm gonna be late for practice!

225
00:20:05,773 --> 00:20:08,651
You've been doing this for a year
and nobody's called.

226
00:20:08,733 --> 00:20:12,089
This is a great house. l love this house.

227
00:20:12,173 --> 00:20:14,164
lt's a waste oftime.

228
00:20:14,253 --> 00:20:16,926
l bet l get this house. Five bucks.

229
00:20:17,013 --> 00:20:19,004
Five bucks.

230
00:20:30,133 --> 00:20:32,852
- Hello.
- Oh! l was just leaving a note.

231
00:20:32,933 --> 00:20:35,527
How kind. Please, won't you come in?

232
00:20:35,613 --> 00:20:37,604
All right.

233
00:20:45,493 --> 00:20:47,848
l don't believe we've met.

234
00:20:47,933 --> 00:20:50,128
- Barbara Rose.
- l'm Maureen.

235
00:20:50,213 --> 00:20:54,684
l don't remember Mother mentioning you,
but she had so many friends.

236
00:20:56,813 --> 00:20:59,407
Oh! Oh, l'm very sorry.

237
00:20:59,493 --> 00:21:02,087
Thank you. She went peacefully.

238
00:21:02,173 --> 00:21:04,403
What am l going to do with this old place?

239
00:21:04,493 --> 00:21:10,090
l just can't bear to put it up for sale and have
a bunch of strangers tromping through it.

240
00:21:10,173 --> 00:21:14,451
lf l could just find someone
who would love it as much as Mom did.

241
00:21:14,533 --> 00:21:18,526
That's more important to me
than whatever money we get for it.

242
00:21:18,613 --> 00:21:20,968
lf you know anybody
who might be interested...

243
00:21:22,293 --> 00:21:27,321
- Can we go up and pick our rooms?
- We can do whatever we want. lt's our house.

244
00:21:27,413 --> 00:21:30,246
Who gets first pick? As if l had to ask.

245
00:21:31,253 --> 00:21:34,450
Don't get scared. We'll do it together.

246
00:21:34,533 --> 00:21:36,649
l just feel kind of strange.

247
00:21:36,733 --> 00:21:39,247
l mean, this house is so beautiful

248
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:41,324
and we live here.

249
00:21:41,413 --> 00:21:44,325
This is who we are? This is me?

250
00:21:49,453 --> 00:21:51,569
- l'll be home early.
- Where are you going?

251
00:21:51,653 --> 00:21:55,248
To work. l wish l didn't have to,
but somebody's got to pay for all this.

252
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:58,643
- lt's Saturday.
- Come on, this is a great day.

253
00:21:59,853 --> 00:22:02,242
You got the fun part!

254
00:22:10,013 --> 00:22:12,004
Kitchen first.

255
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:17,722
Everything was working for the Roses.

256
00:22:18,533 --> 00:22:20,524
Let me restate that.

257
00:22:21,453 --> 00:22:24,490
The Roses were working for everything.

258
00:22:24,573 --> 00:22:28,725
Over the next six years, Oliver dug in.
Made senior partner.

259
00:22:28,813 --> 00:22:31,532
The kids lopped off 70, 80 pounds.

260
00:22:31,613 --> 00:22:34,173
And Barbara laboured seven days a week

261
00:22:34,253 --> 00:22:38,246
to create the perfect home
that Oliver always dreamed of.

262
00:22:38,853 --> 00:22:41,492
Not easy for a girl who grew up
drinking her milk

263
00:22:41,573 --> 00:22:44,610
from glasses with chipped, yellow flowers.

264
00:22:44,693 --> 00:22:49,005
There were a million choices...
and she sweated every one of 'em.

265
00:22:49,653 --> 00:22:52,213
She refiinishedall the tables herself.

266
00:22:52,293 --> 00:22:55,922
lt took sixmonths
to get the floors exactly right.

267
00:22:56,333 --> 00:23:00,565
A hundred Sundays to fiind the perfect
Staffordshire fiigures andplates

268
00:23:00,653 --> 00:23:03,292
that she put over the fiireplace.

269
00:23:03,373 --> 00:23:05,762
When you work thathard on something,

270
00:23:05,853 --> 00:23:10,210
eventually you have to fiinish
and face the awful question:

271
00:23:10,293 --> 00:23:12,284
''What's left to do?''

272
00:23:17,853 --> 00:23:20,048
- Are you working?
- Yes. ls it important?

273
00:23:20,133 --> 00:23:23,045
Yes. Kind of. l hope so.

274
00:23:24,053 --> 00:23:27,568
Stephanie Mayes called to say
thank you for dinner the other night.

275
00:23:27,653 --> 00:23:31,282
She said the pâté l made was so good
l should go into business.

276
00:23:31,373 --> 00:23:34,285
So l asked her if she really meant it
and she said she did,

277
00:23:34,373 --> 00:23:37,046
so l took a pound over to her
and collected $35.

278
00:23:38,413 --> 00:23:42,088
l'd almost forgotten
what it felt like to make money.

279
00:23:42,173 --> 00:23:46,451
- You sold liver to our friends?
- She paid me in cash, Oliver.

280
00:23:46,533 --> 00:23:50,492
Somehow that felt different from
the money l get cashing a cheque.

281
00:23:50,573 --> 00:23:54,612
lt made me feel like...
trading in the Volvo on one ofthose...

282
00:23:54,693 --> 00:24:00,006
four-wheel drive things with the big,
knobby tyres and the 200-horsepower engine.

283
00:24:00,093 --> 00:24:02,732
So l did. l'm gonna pick it up tomorrow.

284
00:24:04,653 --> 00:24:07,042
Thank you so much for telling me.

285
00:24:08,373 --> 00:24:12,969
And you think that you... need this?
l mean, the Volvo was a fine car.

286
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:17,042
- l'll pay for it with my own money.
- How much does it cost?

287
00:24:17,133 --> 00:24:21,092
All right, l know it was kind of crazy
but l just... wanted it, OK?

288
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:24,288
25,000.

289
00:24:25,773 --> 00:24:29,527
So you only have to sell
700 more pounds of pâté.

290
00:24:30,733 --> 00:24:33,930
Maybe l will. Maybe l'm starting a business.

291
00:24:35,413 --> 00:24:39,247
- But ifyou don't want me to, uh...
- No. No, no, no, no. You do it.

292
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:41,324
Do it. Do it.

293
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:50,324
l'm doing it.

294
00:24:55,853 --> 00:24:59,687
Wait a minute. Wait one minute.
l do not understand. What's the, uh...

295
00:24:59,773 --> 00:25:02,003
what's the attitude?

296
00:25:02,093 --> 00:25:04,084
l told you l would handle it.

297
00:25:04,173 --> 00:25:08,883
Yeah, and l didn't see anything happening
so l went to Ed and l set up the interview.

298
00:25:08,973 --> 00:25:13,012
- l would have done it.
- Yeah, but sometimes you need a little push.

299
00:25:13,893 --> 00:25:16,248
We all need a little push.

300
00:25:17,533 --> 00:25:20,093
We agreed that,
if you're doing this liver bit,

301
00:25:20,173 --> 00:25:23,245
we would need someone
to take care ofthe house, right?

302
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:25,324
Right, Oliver. Right again.

303
00:25:25,413 --> 00:25:29,804
Oh, come on. Let's not argue, OK?
Just think about it for a minute!

304
00:25:33,493 --> 00:25:37,168
lf you don't want to interview the lady,
l will send her home.

305
00:25:37,253 --> 00:25:40,370
l'm only trying to make your life easier.

306
00:25:47,253 --> 00:25:51,326
Somehow the thought of a stranger living
in my house just seems weird, you know?

307
00:25:51,413 --> 00:25:54,689
Doesn't it? l don't mean just for us,
but for you, too.

308
00:25:55,213 --> 00:25:58,250
- Oh, but then l guess you do this all the time.
- No, no.

309
00:25:58,653 --> 00:26:02,771
l try this as a means offinding
room and board and a little money.

310
00:26:03,773 --> 00:26:07,402
l'm also attending a few classes
at William and Mary College.

311
00:26:07,973 --> 00:26:11,170
But that won't interfere with my duties.

312
00:26:11,253 --> 00:26:13,642
That's great. l'm happy for you - really.

313
00:26:14,053 --> 00:26:17,966
- So, do l get the job?
- The fact is, Susan, l don't need a live-in.

314
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:21,324
This was my husband's suggestion.

315
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:25,088
l have raised two kids on my own
and now they're about to go offto college.

316
00:26:25,173 --> 00:26:28,643
- They were both accepted at Harvard.
- That's a nice school, too.

317
00:26:28,733 --> 00:26:30,212
Thanks.

318
00:26:30,293 --> 00:26:32,966
So, anyway, it'll just be
Oliver and me here at home.

319
00:26:33,053 --> 00:26:35,886
Although l am getting going
my own catering business.

320
00:26:35,973 --> 00:26:38,646
But let's face it,
l don't need to work for the money.

321
00:26:38,733 --> 00:26:43,011
And that does not make me one ofthese
women who is married to a successful man

322
00:26:43,093 --> 00:26:46,130
and has dedicated her life
to him and her children,

323
00:26:46,213 --> 00:26:51,162
and then has to validate herself as a human
being, because her children are leaving her,

324
00:26:51,253 --> 00:26:53,687
by studying photography
or opening an art gallery

325
00:26:53,773 --> 00:26:57,607
or going into interior design
in her husband's office. No!

326
00:26:58,333 --> 00:27:02,212
l have a wonderful house,
crammed with beautiful things.

327
00:27:02,293 --> 00:27:05,683
l did this house myself. l did a greatjob.

328
00:27:05,773 --> 00:27:08,685
Not that l am necessarily
a slave to materialism. No.

329
00:27:09,693 --> 00:27:13,402
But l am proud ofwhat l have accomplished,

330
00:27:13,493 --> 00:27:18,521
although l suppose some people find my life
disgusting. Disgusting is too strong a word.

331
00:27:18,613 --> 00:27:23,767
No, l would not say that many people
would respectthe choices l have made,

332
00:27:23,853 --> 00:27:26,811
although women would. Women like me.

333
00:27:27,933 --> 00:27:31,687
But then l don't care what they think
because l can't stand who they are.

334
00:27:31,773 --> 00:27:35,561
What l'm trying to say, Susan,
is that l don't need a live-in.

335
00:27:38,453 --> 00:27:43,925
Well... thanks for the interview
and good luck, and God bless you.

336
00:27:44,773 --> 00:27:46,843
l would like you to understand

337
00:27:46,933 --> 00:27:50,289
that, if l were to hire you,
my life would probably change.

338
00:27:50,373 --> 00:27:52,762
You would be this new element in the house.

339
00:27:54,933 --> 00:27:56,924
Well...

340
00:27:57,653 --> 00:27:59,723
Let me show you where your room is.

341
00:28:08,493 --> 00:28:10,324
Hey, Bennie. Dumb dog.

342
00:28:18,413 --> 00:28:19,926
Hey, Bennie!

343
00:28:20,013 --> 00:28:22,481
Let's see if he'll go for it again.

344
00:28:22,893 --> 00:28:24,485
Bennie...

345
00:28:28,013 --> 00:28:30,004
Yeah, dumb.

346
00:28:41,813 --> 00:28:45,726
Oh, the Bennie boy.
The Bennie-Bennie-Bennie boy. Yes.

347
00:28:45,813 --> 00:28:48,725
He's the best boy. He's the best boy!
We love our good boy.

348
00:28:48,813 --> 00:28:50,849
He's a good boy! We love our Bennie boy.

349
00:28:50,933 --> 00:28:53,288
Yes, a pretty dog! He's a pretty dog!

350
00:29:19,813 --> 00:29:22,247
Rose residence.

351
00:29:22,333 --> 00:29:25,769
- Susan, is that for me?
- lt's for Josh.

352
00:29:25,853 --> 00:29:29,368
- Are you expecting a call?
- Jason Larrabee said he'd confirm lunch.

353
00:29:29,453 --> 00:29:32,092
l'm trying to land him as a client.

354
00:29:32,173 --> 00:29:35,609
The word around town is he's up
for a Cabinet post. l wish he'd call.

355
00:29:35,853 --> 00:29:38,321
He will.

356
00:29:40,213 --> 00:29:43,091
Did you get a chance
to look over that contract for me?

357
00:29:43,173 --> 00:29:46,882
- What contract?
- On the consulate luncheon l'm doing.

358
00:29:47,493 --> 00:29:50,929
- Oh, yeah. No, but l'll read it this weekend.
- OK.

359
00:29:51,293 --> 00:29:53,409
No. No, not OK.

360
00:29:53,493 --> 00:29:57,645
l have to sign it tomorrow. l gave it
to you last week, but it's probably fine.

361
00:29:57,733 --> 00:30:00,645
- l'll read it now.
- Oh, no, don't bother.

362
00:30:00,933 --> 00:30:02,924
No. Get it.

363
00:30:06,333 --> 00:30:08,324
Sure.

364
00:30:19,213 --> 00:30:21,408
What?! What is it?

365
00:30:21,493 --> 00:30:23,484
lt's a fly. Where'd it go?

366
00:30:24,653 --> 00:30:26,644
On the fridge.

367
00:30:28,093 --> 00:30:30,687
Stay upwind of him.

368
00:30:35,213 --> 00:30:37,044
How about that?

369
00:30:37,653 --> 00:30:39,723
Not bad, huh?

370
00:30:39,813 --> 00:30:42,202
l admire your technique.

371
00:30:45,773 --> 00:30:47,092
Hello.

372
00:30:47,173 --> 00:30:51,564
Mr Larrabee, hi. How are you?
No! No, no, it's not too late.

373
00:30:51,653 --> 00:30:54,850
Could you hang on just one second
while l use the other phone?

374
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:57,130
Thank you.

375
00:31:00,173 --> 00:31:02,733
Yes, sir. l'm looking forward to that, too.

376
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:05,642
No, no, no. Course you're not bothering me.

377
00:31:05,733 --> 00:31:08,327
Lawyers, we neversleep.

378
00:31:09,933 --> 00:31:12,083
l'm available to you, sir, 24 hours a...

379
00:31:31,893 --> 00:31:35,568
Who left the appliances on in the kitchen?
lt sounds like who knows what!

380
00:31:35,653 --> 00:31:40,647
l must have hit some switches when l was
cleaning up. You know how that can happen.

381
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:42,769
l got great news.

382
00:31:42,853 --> 00:31:44,923
Lunch is on tomorrow with Larrabee.

383
00:31:46,053 --> 00:31:49,409
l'm gonna meet him
at his club in Philadelphia.

384
00:31:49,493 --> 00:31:51,484
He's mine!

385
00:31:51,573 --> 00:31:54,531
Look how crazy you are
about yourself right now.

386
00:31:54,613 --> 00:31:57,332
- l'm sorry.
- Don't apologise.

387
00:31:57,413 --> 00:32:02,646
l live with the assumption that all guys
owe an apology to the woman they live with.

388
00:32:03,933 --> 00:32:05,412
You're so full of shit.

389
00:32:06,573 --> 00:32:09,690
So, where's that little contract ofyours?

390
00:32:09,773 --> 00:32:12,765
Maybe l can up your price, huh?

391
00:32:12,853 --> 00:32:14,844
Where is it?

392
00:32:15,493 --> 00:32:17,961
- You sure it's all right?
- My fee's going up.

393
00:32:18,053 --> 00:32:20,362
Better get me while you can afford me.

394
00:32:24,293 --> 00:32:27,205
- l don't want you to read it.
- Let me have it.

395
00:32:34,493 --> 00:32:36,723
l got you and l'm not gonna let you get away!

396
00:32:38,853 --> 00:32:40,809
Let me go.

397
00:32:40,893 --> 00:32:43,282
Let me go! Let go!

398
00:32:45,373 --> 00:32:47,364
Let go of it! Let go!

399
00:32:53,693 --> 00:32:55,684
Ah, Jesus!

400
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:08,930
You think you're pretty strong,
don't you?

401
00:33:16,253 --> 00:33:18,892
What the hell is wrong with you?

402
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:27,406
lf you're with a woman for any length oftime,
eventually you'll ask her that question.

403
00:33:27,493 --> 00:33:29,927
lf she doesn't answer, that's trouble.

404
00:33:30,013 --> 00:33:34,404
And when trouble begins, it comes at you
from directions you'd never expect.

405
00:33:34,493 --> 00:33:36,165
Oliver was a sitting duck.

406
00:33:36,253 --> 00:33:39,211
l think you're gonna be
very well served by our firm,

407
00:33:39,293 --> 00:33:41,568
especially ifthe rumours are true.

408
00:33:41,653 --> 00:33:45,771
Well, there may be a Senate
confirmation hearing in my future.

409
00:33:45,853 --> 00:33:49,641
- We could definitely be of help with that.
- Yes. Waiter... Ohh!

410
00:33:49,733 --> 00:33:52,850
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. l'm fine.

411
00:33:52,933 --> 00:33:56,130
- Could l have some more coffee, please?
- Certainly, sir.

412
00:33:56,213 --> 00:33:58,727
Regarding your Senate confirmation,

413
00:33:58,813 --> 00:34:02,852
it may not be a bad idea for us
to have your personal asset liability...

414
00:34:04,373 --> 00:34:06,523
Oliver?

415
00:34:06,613 --> 00:34:09,207
Do you think you're having a heart attack?

416
00:34:12,773 --> 00:34:15,970
- Call an ambulance!
- Wipe that stuff off his chin.

417
00:34:16,053 --> 00:34:18,442
- Hang in there, Oliver.
- Call my wife.

418
00:34:25,493 --> 00:34:27,449
You're doing just fine.

419
00:34:27,533 --> 00:34:31,287
- Somebody called for the defibrillator.
- Right here.

420
00:34:35,253 --> 00:34:37,403
How's it goin'?

421
00:34:37,493 --> 00:34:40,087
You may be the only person
l'm doing better than.

422
00:34:41,773 --> 00:34:44,367
The wife stabbed me in the stomach.

423
00:34:45,693 --> 00:34:48,253
With a nail file this time.

424
00:34:48,333 --> 00:34:50,608
She's training to be a manicurist.

425
00:34:50,693 --> 00:34:55,562
- They make good money, you know?
- l'm trying to get a doctor for you, babe.

426
00:34:55,653 --> 00:34:57,689
They always feel bad after.

427
00:34:57,773 --> 00:35:00,333
Mr Rose? l'm Dr Gordon.
This is my associate.

428
00:35:00,413 --> 00:35:03,849
- Dr Hillerman. Jason Larrabee called us.
- How are his vital signs?

429
00:35:03,933 --> 00:35:06,845
- We were here first.
- We'll be with you in just a moment.

430
00:35:06,933 --> 00:35:10,642
Babes, take it easy.
Can't you see the guy's dying over here?

431
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:12,724
- Did someone call my wife?
- Yes.

432
00:35:12,853 --> 00:35:16,528
l need to write her a note...
in case she doesn't get here in time.

433
00:35:16,613 --> 00:35:19,605
- Let's get him to ClCU.
- Jeff, let's go.

434
00:35:21,093 --> 00:35:23,129
l'll get the pen back once we get there.

435
00:35:25,253 --> 00:35:27,403
- ls my wife here?
- l don't think so.

436
00:35:28,653 --> 00:35:31,167
Get me some pictures. Upper Gl.

437
00:35:31,253 --> 00:35:36,805
You're gonna have to swallow some barium.
But you'll like it. lt's peppermint flavoured.

438
00:35:38,973 --> 00:35:41,612
Nothing is more important
than the hors d'oeuvres.

439
00:35:41,693 --> 00:35:44,161
That's where people
make their firstjudgment.

440
00:35:44,253 --> 00:35:48,371
Perdóname, senora. La senora Rose
ha recibido una llamada urgente.

441
00:35:48,453 --> 00:35:51,206
There's an urgent phone call for you.

442
00:35:52,693 --> 00:35:54,012
Hello?

443
00:35:54,093 --> 00:35:55,845
Oh, God!

444
00:35:55,933 --> 00:35:58,731
Oh, my God! All right. l'm leaving right now.

445
00:35:59,373 --> 00:36:02,729
- My husband's had a heart attack.
- That happened to my mother.

446
00:36:02,813 --> 00:36:07,523
Don't worry. Your luncheon's gonna
be terrific. Everything's gonna be great.

447
00:36:08,293 --> 00:36:12,411
The x-rays showed an oesophageal tear.
lt's commonly known as a hiatal hernia.

448
00:36:12,693 --> 00:36:14,365
Right there.

449
00:36:14,453 --> 00:36:16,762
The pain symptoms are identical to angina.

450
00:36:16,853 --> 00:36:20,084
Stress, coffee, spicy foods, gas.

451
00:36:20,173 --> 00:36:24,963
Your nerve endings get irritated. You know
what that's like. Not pleasant, but not fatal.

452
00:36:25,053 --> 00:36:27,248
Could you get this hiatal hernia, say,

453
00:36:27,333 --> 00:36:30,848
by being squeezed
between someone's legs?

454
00:36:33,013 --> 00:36:34,207
No.

455
00:36:34,293 --> 00:36:37,603
- So l'm not going to die?
- Eventually, but not today.

456
00:36:41,053 --> 00:36:43,248
Thank you.

457
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:47,642
- You can wait right here.
- Thank you.

458
00:36:53,573 --> 00:36:55,803
Oliver! You're alive!

459
00:36:55,893 --> 00:36:59,727
Yeah, it was something else.
lt wasn't the heart, it was a rip. A tear.

460
00:36:59,813 --> 00:37:01,804
You're alive!

461
00:37:02,533 --> 00:37:05,411
- So what are you gonna do?
- Wait for Barbara to pick me up.

462
00:37:05,493 --> 00:37:07,723
- l'll wait with you.
- Good.

463
00:37:10,173 --> 00:37:15,167
Think we can get that nurse to come
back here with a bottle of musk oil?

464
00:37:18,693 --> 00:37:21,491
- She should be here any minute.
- Yeah.

465
00:37:26,213 --> 00:37:28,602
lt's stuffy in these places.

466
00:37:40,373 --> 00:37:43,968
- l got us enough booze for the whole trip.
- Thanks.

467
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:48,331
l couldn't remember whether you wanted
a twist, so l got you some just in case.

468
00:37:48,413 --> 00:37:50,404
Thank you, Gavin.

469
00:37:54,653 --> 00:37:56,928
- Salud.
- Salud.

470
00:38:07,053 --> 00:38:09,328
All those lives going on out there...

471
00:38:09,413 --> 00:38:14,168
People we'll never meet...
experiencing things we'll never know.

472
00:38:15,533 --> 00:38:18,001
We can't know.

473
00:38:18,093 --> 00:38:23,884
ln your own life, by this point,
you think you know what's gonna be but...

474
00:38:24,413 --> 00:38:27,450
- But you don't know.
- You don't know.

475
00:38:29,173 --> 00:38:32,165
lt's always just when you think
you got it figured out

476
00:38:32,253 --> 00:38:36,292
when, bingo, something comes along
and knocks you right on your ass.

477
00:38:37,173 --> 00:38:40,609
Why do you think Barbara
didn't come to the hospital?

478
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:45,566
l don't know.
She probably had a good reason.

479
00:39:12,493 --> 00:39:14,882
Hiya, Bennie. Come here, sweetheart.

480
00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:18,931
Where is everybody, huh?

481
00:39:19,013 --> 00:39:23,564
l guess you're the only one who
gives a damn about me in this family.

482
00:39:44,493 --> 00:39:45,608
Oliver!

483
00:39:45,693 --> 00:39:49,049
You don't know how happy l am to see you!

484
00:39:50,853 --> 00:39:54,163
- You didn't come to the hospital.
- No.

485
00:39:54,253 --> 00:39:56,813
No. Well, l called and...

486
00:39:56,893 --> 00:40:00,169
well, everything seemed to be...
under control.

487
00:40:00,253 --> 00:40:02,767
l just... l didn't want to disturb you.

488
00:40:02,853 --> 00:40:06,892
Disturb me?
Well, l wasn't doing much. Just dying.

489
00:40:06,973 --> 00:40:09,248
Oliver! You weren't dying.

490
00:40:10,053 --> 00:40:13,090
- You didn't even call.
- Of course l did. l talked to someone.

491
00:40:13,173 --> 00:40:15,846
- Not to me.
- Well, l talked to a nurse and...

492
00:40:15,973 --> 00:40:18,168
she said that you weren't dying.

493
00:40:18,253 --> 00:40:20,721
Well, l thought l was dying!

494
00:40:23,693 --> 00:40:27,481
l wrote you a note...
in case you didn't get there in time.

495
00:40:31,253 --> 00:40:33,813
l can't read your handwriting.

496
00:40:34,733 --> 00:40:39,727
l was on a gurney being rushed
to lntensive Care in excruciating pain.

497
00:40:41,013 --> 00:40:43,004
lt says:

498
00:40:44,413 --> 00:40:48,964
''My love, by the time you
receive this, l may be gone.''

499
00:40:49,053 --> 00:40:51,613
''My life was... fun...

500
00:40:51,693 --> 00:40:54,605
..full... beyond my dreams.''

501
00:40:58,173 --> 00:41:01,848
''All l have... and all l am, l owe to you.''

502
00:41:04,173 --> 00:41:07,529
''You gave me courage
to surpass what l know l am,

503
00:41:07,613 --> 00:41:09,604
the strength to...''

504
00:41:10,493 --> 00:41:12,723
Oh, this is where l had a spasm.

505
00:41:13,733 --> 00:41:16,566
l can't read it, but the next line says:

506
00:41:16,653 --> 00:41:20,566
''l lie here, feeling my life ebb away.''

507
00:41:21,653 --> 00:41:24,087
''l cling to your image.''

508
00:41:24,173 --> 00:41:26,687
''l will take you with me to eternity.''

509
00:41:28,453 --> 00:41:30,444
''l cherish you.''

510
00:41:32,893 --> 00:41:35,327
''l thank merciful God for you.''

511
00:41:38,053 --> 00:41:40,521
l didn't have the strength to sign it.

512
00:41:44,773 --> 00:41:47,367
l'm... l'm sure they, um...

513
00:41:48,173 --> 00:41:51,006
they would've told me who it was from.

514
00:41:56,613 --> 00:41:59,411
l can't believe
you didn't call us at school, Mother.

515
00:41:59,493 --> 00:42:04,089
l didn't see any point in alarming you until
there was something to be alarmed about.

516
00:42:07,093 --> 00:42:10,210
Your mother didn't want
to disturb anybody today.

517
00:42:10,693 --> 00:42:13,207
Yeah, well, you still should have called.

518
00:42:14,493 --> 00:42:16,484
You should have.

519
00:42:16,573 --> 00:42:19,565
l'm sure your mother didn't want
to worry you needlessly.

520
00:42:19,653 --> 00:42:22,406
The important thing is your father is alive.

521
00:42:29,813 --> 00:42:32,771
We've always been a family
that communicated.

522
00:42:32,853 --> 00:42:36,971
lf anything important happens,
everyone should know about it.

523
00:42:38,213 --> 00:42:40,488
That's the rule.

524
00:43:28,293 --> 00:43:31,251
- What's going on?
- l'm very upset.

525
00:43:35,413 --> 00:43:39,326
lt's 3 o'clock in the morning.
Turn the television off.

526
00:43:42,333 --> 00:43:46,292
l wasn't sure why l didn't go to the hospital,
but now l think l know.

527
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:48,933
l'd just like to put today behind us, OK?

528
00:43:49,013 --> 00:43:51,004
OK.

529
00:43:53,693 --> 00:43:57,242
l was gonna drive to the hospital,
but l knew you were OK.

530
00:43:58,213 --> 00:44:04,209
Cos l never think that anything really terrible
could happen to me or the kids or you.

531
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:08,282
And l was getting on the expressway,

532
00:44:08,373 --> 00:44:12,127
and suddenly l had this very strong
feeling that you were dead.

533
00:44:13,653 --> 00:44:17,362
And l knew what it would feel like
to be alone in this house,

534
00:44:17,453 --> 00:44:19,444
to not have you in my life.

535
00:44:20,333 --> 00:44:23,530
And l got so scared, l had to pull over.

536
00:44:27,413 --> 00:44:30,450
Well, you don't have to be scared any more.

537
00:44:33,813 --> 00:44:35,963
l got scared because l felt happy.

538
00:44:52,853 --> 00:44:55,321
You were happy because l was dead?

539
00:44:56,333 --> 00:44:58,927
l was happy to be free.

540
00:44:59,013 --> 00:45:01,607
Like a weight had been lifted.

541
00:45:02,693 --> 00:45:05,491
- Like a weight had been lifted?
- Yeah.

542
00:45:07,973 --> 00:45:12,524
So, how am l supposed to respond?
You tell me you wished l was dead?!

543
00:45:13,253 --> 00:45:16,086
l thought it was important.

544
00:45:43,133 --> 00:45:46,125
l think you owe me an apology, Barbara.

545
00:45:46,213 --> 00:45:49,330
lf you have something to say,
l'd like to hear it.

546
00:45:54,573 --> 00:45:56,848
l want a divorce.

547
00:46:00,773 --> 00:46:02,843
No, you don't.

548
00:46:02,933 --> 00:46:05,083
You can't have one!

549
00:46:06,413 --> 00:46:08,847
l've thought about this a lot.

550
00:46:08,933 --> 00:46:11,401
l really don't want to be
married to you any more.

551
00:46:19,093 --> 00:46:21,402
Why do you want a divorce?

552
00:46:21,533 --> 00:46:25,446
Did... did l do something?
Did l... did l notdo something?

553
00:46:27,013 --> 00:46:29,607
l can't give you specifics, Oliver.

554
00:46:31,013 --> 00:46:33,652
- Well, try!
- l don't want to try!

555
00:46:38,613 --> 00:46:41,764
ls there somebody else? Another man?

556
00:46:42,093 --> 00:46:43,412
No.

557
00:46:43,493 --> 00:46:46,246
- A woman?
- You wish.

558
00:46:47,253 --> 00:46:49,244
l should be the one asking for a divorce!

559
00:46:49,333 --> 00:46:51,927
l was rushed to hospital
suffering from severe...

560
00:46:52,413 --> 00:46:54,131
lndigestion.

561
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:58,243
Oh, you're such an expert
at making me look like ajerk.

562
00:46:58,893 --> 00:47:01,487
OK, OK, OK. l'm sorry.

563
00:47:01,573 --> 00:47:04,645
l'm the bad person.
Let's just blame me for this.

564
00:47:04,853 --> 00:47:07,890
No! No. l think l need...

565
00:47:07,973 --> 00:47:09,964
l think you owe me,

566
00:47:10,053 --> 00:47:14,205
after this many pretty goddamn good
years of marriage, a solid reason.

567
00:47:14,293 --> 00:47:18,491
l worked my ass offto make enough money
to provide you with a good life,

568
00:47:18,573 --> 00:47:21,326
and you owe me a reason that makes sense.

569
00:47:22,253 --> 00:47:25,802
So let's hear it.
Come on. Let's hear it. Let's hear it!

570
00:47:26,733 --> 00:47:29,122
Because...

571
00:47:29,213 --> 00:47:31,727
when l watch you eat,

572
00:47:31,813 --> 00:47:34,373
when l see you asleep,

573
00:47:34,453 --> 00:47:36,967
when l look at you lately,

574
00:47:37,053 --> 00:47:39,248
l just wanna smash your face in.

575
00:47:42,853 --> 00:47:47,290
Come on, smash my face.
Come on. You wanna smash my face?

576
00:48:05,013 --> 00:48:08,005
The next time... l hit back.

577
00:48:10,893 --> 00:48:14,363
And you'd better get yourself
a damn good lawyer.

578
00:48:15,013 --> 00:48:17,652
The best your money can buy.

579
00:48:41,013 --> 00:48:43,163
- What does she want?
- Child support.

580
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:45,130
l've always taken care of my kids.

581
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:49,286
And they will be 18 in one year,
which makes it nice for you.

582
00:48:49,373 --> 00:48:55,005
- What about alimony?
- Barbara, against my advice, waives alimony.

583
00:48:55,093 --> 00:48:59,245
l'm making money with my business.
l get a lot of referrals. l can support myself.

584
00:48:59,573 --> 00:49:01,689
Well, l'm a lucky guy.

585
00:49:01,773 --> 00:49:04,571
My client is being more than fair, Mr Rose.

586
00:49:04,653 --> 00:49:09,249
She's waived alimony and she's willing to
waive her rights against your law practice

587
00:49:09,333 --> 00:49:14,566
in exchange for the house and all of
its contents, except your shaving gear and...

588
00:49:15,213 --> 00:49:17,568
his clothing?

589
00:49:17,853 --> 00:49:21,892
- Everything l made went into that house.
- l found that house.

590
00:49:21,973 --> 00:49:25,602
Every piece offurniture is where it is
because l put it there. lt is my house.

591
00:49:25,693 --> 00:49:28,651
lf your client has finished yammering,
explain to her

592
00:49:28,733 --> 00:49:32,692
that a wife does not
automatically get the house.

593
00:49:33,093 --> 00:49:38,042
l thought you told her that
she was entitled to anything and everything.

594
00:49:38,133 --> 00:49:40,601
- l told her what?
- Yes...

595
00:49:41,653 --> 00:49:43,564
Here it is.

596
00:49:43,653 --> 00:49:45,962
l quote: ''My love,

597
00:49:46,773 --> 00:49:49,003
by the time you...''

598
00:49:49,093 --> 00:49:51,084
Boy, what a handwriting.

599
00:49:51,653 --> 00:49:55,362
''By the time you receive this, l may be gone.''

600
00:49:59,253 --> 00:50:03,849
''All l am and all l have, l owe to you.''

601
00:50:05,373 --> 00:50:07,933
You wrote this, Mr Rose?

602
00:50:10,453 --> 00:50:16,323
Excuse me, Mr Thurmont, you tiny,
little, worm-like, infinitesimal prick,

603
00:50:16,413 --> 00:50:19,928
could l have a word with my wife, please?

604
00:50:20,853 --> 00:50:22,730
Certainly.

605
00:50:26,933 --> 00:50:30,243
lf this is a who-can-sink-lowest-fastest
contest, you won.

606
00:50:31,293 --> 00:50:33,363
By showing him my letter,

607
00:50:33,453 --> 00:50:37,890
you have sunk below the deepest layer
of prehistoric frog shit

608
00:50:37,973 --> 00:50:40,533
at the bottom of a New Jersey scum swamp.

609
00:50:43,613 --> 00:50:46,605
l may have let you have the house,
but now...

610
00:50:46,693 --> 00:50:48,843
you'll never get it.

611
00:50:48,933 --> 00:50:51,766
You will never get that house.

612
00:50:52,613 --> 00:50:54,888
Do you understand?

613
00:50:55,773 --> 00:50:59,049
You will never get that house.

614
00:51:02,253 --> 00:51:06,405
- We'll see.
- Yeah... we'll see.

615
00:51:16,133 --> 00:51:18,522
Maybe l shouldn't have
let you see that letter.

616
00:51:18,613 --> 00:51:21,173
Dear girl, by the time this is all over,

617
00:51:21,253 --> 00:51:24,370
you'll think oftoday
as one ofyour lighter moments.

618
00:51:29,093 --> 00:51:33,371
What do you call 500 lawyers
at the bottom ofthe ocean?

619
00:51:33,453 --> 00:51:35,762
An excellent start.

620
00:51:37,493 --> 00:51:40,132
l used to resentjokes like that.

621
00:51:41,813 --> 00:51:44,452
Now l see them as simple truths.

622
00:51:46,493 --> 00:51:49,087
Lawyers...

623
00:51:52,293 --> 00:51:54,329
Hello.

624
00:51:54,413 --> 00:51:57,325
Honey, l can't talk right now.
l'm with a client.

625
00:51:57,413 --> 00:52:00,325
Love you, miss you, want you... Bye!

626
00:52:04,413 --> 00:52:06,688
l recently married.

627
00:52:08,573 --> 00:52:13,567
Which is the last thing l ever thought
l'd do after what happened to the Roses.

628
00:52:13,653 --> 00:52:18,568
When it comes to women...
l hope l'm a better man now than l was.

629
00:52:20,333 --> 00:52:24,121
l know l'm a better lawyer,
when it comes to divorce.

630
00:52:25,413 --> 00:52:29,292
l'll never make another mistake
like l made with Oliver.

631
00:52:31,133 --> 00:52:33,852
Let's just concentrate on the job at hand.

632
00:52:33,933 --> 00:52:36,083
She wants the house. You want the house.

633
00:52:36,573 --> 00:52:40,168
- l'm the one who's living in a hotel room!
- Not for long.

634
00:52:40,253 --> 00:52:43,211
- She claims she found the house.
- She did find it, right?

635
00:52:43,293 --> 00:52:47,684
Yeah, but that's not the point. She says
she made it what it is. She didn't. She didn't.

636
00:52:48,093 --> 00:52:52,450
l'm not keeping score but, if l were,
it'd be about 83 to 6 in my favour.

637
00:52:52,533 --> 00:52:54,842
Of all the really... good stuff.

638
00:52:54,933 --> 00:52:57,811
Those wonderful Staffordshire dogs...

639
00:52:57,893 --> 00:53:02,409
ln fact, most ofthe Staffordshires, l found.
And that Art-Deco rug and, uh...

640
00:53:02,493 --> 00:53:06,611
And that stove in the kitchen? She wouldn't
have bought it if l hadn't pushed her!

641
00:53:07,013 --> 00:53:09,288
Shoes. That's what she's good at buying.

642
00:53:09,373 --> 00:53:13,002
l gotta have shelves in the closet
or she'd have them all over the place!

643
00:53:13,333 --> 00:53:16,131
Here we go. You're gonna love this.

644
00:53:16,213 --> 00:53:19,489
Civil Code, Title 16-9-0-4, Section C.

645
00:53:19,573 --> 00:53:24,601
l used this once for a freebie divorce
l did for my cousin Paulie. Total loser.

646
00:53:24,693 --> 00:53:26,172
Read.

647
00:53:26,253 --> 00:53:29,484
''For the purposes of subsections
one and two of paragraphs...''

648
00:53:29,573 --> 00:53:33,202
Here. Skip down to...
''Parties who have pursued separate lives...''

649
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:36,922
''Parties who have pursued separate
lives sharing neither bed nor board

650
00:53:37,013 --> 00:53:39,083
shall be deemed to have lived apart

651
00:53:39,173 --> 00:53:42,483
even though they reside
under the same roof...''

652
00:53:44,453 --> 00:53:47,047
Even though they reside
under the same roof?

653
00:53:47,133 --> 00:53:49,931
Yeah. The law was put on the books
for poor people:

654
00:53:50,013 --> 00:53:53,608
folks who couldn't afford
separate residences. But we can use it.

655
00:53:53,893 --> 00:53:57,090
- So l can move back in.
- lfyour divorce is settled in court,

656
00:53:57,173 --> 00:54:01,689
it shows you're committed to the property.
Plus, you can see she doesn't sell the assets.

657
00:54:01,773 --> 00:54:04,048
l can work on her,
get her to fold on the house.

658
00:54:04,133 --> 00:54:07,842
No. No, Oliver, you don't even
deal with her. You avoid her.

659
00:54:07,933 --> 00:54:09,924
Women can be a lot meaner than we think.

660
00:54:10,013 --> 00:54:12,971
Never underestimate her as an adversary.
Don't talk to her.

661
00:54:13,053 --> 00:54:16,090
No, no, no, l won't. Don't worry about me.

662
00:54:16,173 --> 00:54:18,004
Gavin...

663
00:54:18,133 --> 00:54:19,885
- Thank you.
- All right.

664
00:54:20,733 --> 00:54:24,521
All right, go on. Go home.

665
00:54:24,853 --> 00:54:28,687
- This is the stupidest thing you've ever done!
- Second stupidest.

666
00:54:28,773 --> 00:54:31,412
- You can't stay here!
- The law says l can.

667
00:54:31,493 --> 00:54:35,202
Title 16-9-0-4, Section C.

668
00:54:36,373 --> 00:54:38,933
Look it up, tootsie pie.

669
00:54:52,373 --> 00:54:54,284
OK, Mom, you're on.

670
00:54:56,493 --> 00:54:58,484
Let me see that bag.

671
00:55:07,413 --> 00:55:10,450
ls that what you're gonna put on top?

672
00:55:10,533 --> 00:55:12,410
- Yes, it is.
- Fine.

673
00:55:12,493 --> 00:55:14,882
Josh, plug it in, please.

674
00:55:32,133 --> 00:55:34,169
- lt's a short.
- lt's not a short.

675
00:55:34,253 --> 00:55:37,211
One ofthe ornaments
is touching the sockets.

676
00:55:40,773 --> 00:55:43,241
Fine.

677
00:55:43,333 --> 00:55:46,131
You take care of it, Oliver.

678
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:53,050
Come on, it's Christmas time.
Let's get festive.

679
00:55:53,933 --> 00:55:56,925
- l have to go out.
- l got stuff l gotta do in my room.

680
00:56:19,133 --> 00:56:22,091
- Oh, God, my house is on fire!
- Mine too, babe!

681
00:56:22,173 --> 00:56:24,368
Really, you idiot!

682
00:56:27,333 --> 00:56:29,051
Wait up, babe!

683
00:56:29,933 --> 00:56:31,605
Oh, my God!

684
00:56:31,933 --> 00:56:33,605
Omar, do something!

685
00:56:33,693 --> 00:56:35,604
- Fire!
- Mom!

686
00:56:35,733 --> 00:56:38,167
Fire! Fire!

687
00:56:38,853 --> 00:56:41,003
Call the police! l'll get the extinguisher!

688
00:56:41,093 --> 00:56:44,210
991. 999. 911.

689
00:56:45,413 --> 00:56:47,404
- Stay out ofthe way!
- Coming through!

690
00:56:47,493 --> 00:56:51,566
''One: store in a cool place.
Two: hold upright, pull pin out.'' OK.

691
00:56:51,653 --> 00:56:55,123
- ''Three: stand back, aim away from face.''
- Do it!

692
00:56:55,213 --> 00:56:58,205
- Dad, hurry!
- All right! OK, OK! All right. OK, OK.

693
00:57:02,533 --> 00:57:04,922
Dad! The curtain!

694
00:57:21,413 --> 00:57:24,291
lt's over. Thank God l was here!

695
00:57:25,453 --> 00:57:27,444
The whole house could have gone up.

696
00:57:27,533 --> 00:57:31,845
OK, OK. l'll get a sponge
and start cleaning up.

697
00:57:32,573 --> 00:57:35,485
Maybe a rake... or a bulldozer.

698
00:57:55,573 --> 00:57:57,689
lt might not have been the lights.

699
00:57:58,693 --> 00:58:01,082
You always know.

700
00:58:19,693 --> 00:58:23,845
Rather than argue about who supposedly
did what, l'd like to reach some accord.

701
00:58:23,933 --> 00:58:26,845
- Time is passing.
- l'd love to be done with this, too.

702
00:58:26,933 --> 00:58:30,608
Right. lfwe leave settlement to the court,
the lawyers get everything!

703
00:58:30,693 --> 00:58:32,923
So l've come up with a fair solution.

704
00:58:33,013 --> 00:58:35,004
- You wanna hear it?
- Yes.

705
00:58:35,093 --> 00:58:39,564
Now, l understand your point of view.
You've invested 18 years in this marriage.

706
00:58:39,653 --> 00:58:44,090
That's worth a lot.
A tremendous amount. $163,800.

707
00:58:45,093 --> 00:58:48,005
- How did you arrive at that number?
- Fairly.

708
00:58:48,093 --> 00:58:52,689
- You do almost the same things as Susan.
- No! She's in college. She should make more.

709
00:58:52,773 --> 00:58:54,252
Barbara!

710
00:58:54,333 --> 00:58:58,042
There is no comparison whatsoever
between what she does and...

711
00:58:58,133 --> 00:59:01,409
Her salary is a base, so l doubled it.

712
00:59:01,493 --> 00:59:04,053
And that wasn't enough,
and then l tripled it,

713
00:59:04,133 --> 00:59:06,931
and that's how l came up with this figure.

714
00:59:07,013 --> 00:59:10,688
$490,633, approximately.

715
00:59:10,773 --> 00:59:13,287
l shall give you that in cash. lt won't be easy.

716
00:59:13,373 --> 00:59:15,841
lt'll be harder than hell,
but l'm gonna do it.

717
00:59:15,933 --> 00:59:19,323
You just have to, you know,
agree to give up the house.

718
00:59:19,413 --> 00:59:23,486
You owe me. You've gotten more out of
knowing me than l've got out of knowing you.

719
00:59:23,573 --> 00:59:28,647
l'm not even gonna ask you what that means.
l found this house! l bought everything in it!

720
00:59:28,733 --> 00:59:32,362
With my money! lt's a lot easier to spend it
than it is to make it, honeybun!

721
00:59:32,453 --> 00:59:35,331
You might not have made it
if not for me, sweet cakes!

722
00:59:35,413 --> 00:59:37,973
You weren't even multiorgasmic
before you met me!

723
00:59:39,013 --> 00:59:41,607
You expect me to keep
reassuring you sexually,

724
00:59:41,693 --> 00:59:44,287
even now when we disgust each other?!

725
00:59:53,493 --> 00:59:56,849
Don't let this bother you.
lt's all gonna work out.

726
01:00:01,173 --> 01:00:03,892
The red areas are hers.

727
01:00:03,973 --> 01:00:06,441
The yellow areas are mine.

728
01:00:06,533 --> 01:00:08,410
Green is neutral.

729
01:00:08,973 --> 01:00:13,330
The kitchen was difficult, but Barbara
came up with the idea oftime allotment.

730
01:00:14,813 --> 01:00:17,566
This seems rational to you both?

731
01:00:18,253 --> 01:00:20,289
Yeah.

732
01:00:21,533 --> 01:00:23,524
Oliver, my father used to say

733
01:00:23,613 --> 01:00:27,208
that a man could never outdo a woman
when it came to love or revenge.

734
01:00:27,293 --> 01:00:31,525
Why don't you let her have the house?
There are other houses. And other women.

735
01:00:31,613 --> 01:00:35,925
No, no, no. l'm going to win because
l've got her to accept the ground rules.

736
01:00:36,013 --> 01:00:40,848
Oliver, there is no winning in this.
lt's only degrees of losing.

737
01:00:42,493 --> 01:00:45,246
l got more square footage.

738
01:01:09,565 --> 01:01:14,036
Sorry to disturb you, but l was wondering
if l could borrow a sleeping tablet.

739
01:01:15,365 --> 01:01:18,835
- Did Oliver send you for it?
- No. Actually, no.

740
01:01:21,685 --> 01:01:23,676
All right, you got me there.

741
01:01:23,765 --> 01:01:26,996
Which is good, because l'm
uncomfortable with the charade.

742
01:01:27,325 --> 01:01:31,477
lt's nice to see somebody still
caring for somebody in this house.

743
01:01:32,245 --> 01:01:35,555
- Good night, Susan.
- So, there will be no pills?

744
01:01:36,165 --> 01:01:39,282
Oh, kitty. Kitty, wait.

745
01:01:39,365 --> 01:01:41,356
Kitty, kitty...

746
01:01:58,285 --> 01:02:01,243
Do you want me to call around
to find an open drugstore?

747
01:02:01,325 --> 01:02:03,316
l'll find one.

748
01:02:04,525 --> 01:02:07,164
- Should l come?
- lt's up to you.

749
01:02:08,165 --> 01:02:10,918
- These are my favourite kind of cars.
- lt's a Morgan.

750
01:02:11,005 --> 01:02:13,041
Of course.

751
01:02:26,125 --> 01:02:28,434
lt's cosy.

752
01:02:46,485 --> 01:02:48,794
- What was that?
- A bump of some sort.

753
01:02:53,005 --> 01:02:55,439
Oh, Kitty! Oh, mein Gott.

754
01:03:00,445 --> 01:03:05,075
Look, why don't you go into the house
and find a large Ziploc bag?

755
01:03:05,165 --> 01:03:07,884
- Ziploc?
- Yeah.

756
01:03:08,325 --> 01:03:11,078
Oh, kitty. Kitty, kitty, kitty.

757
01:03:11,165 --> 01:03:13,633
So much for the nine lives myth.

758
01:03:27,165 --> 01:03:29,918
Here, kitty. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

759
01:03:31,045 --> 01:03:32,717
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty!

760
01:03:32,805 --> 01:03:34,284
Here, puss, puss, puss!

761
01:03:34,765 --> 01:03:36,756
Here, puss, puss, puss!

762
01:03:38,725 --> 01:03:42,195
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

763
01:03:43,205 --> 01:03:45,435
Have you see my cat?

764
01:03:45,525 --> 01:03:48,198
Are you talking to me?

765
01:03:57,085 --> 01:03:59,838
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty. Come on, kitty.

766
01:03:59,925 --> 01:04:02,155
Here, puss, puss, puss, puss.

767
01:04:02,245 --> 01:04:04,839
Where are you, kitty? Come on!

768
01:04:04,925 --> 01:04:07,041
Here, kitty, kitty!

769
01:04:07,125 --> 01:04:09,116
Come on, kitty, kitty. Come on.

770
01:04:09,205 --> 01:04:11,196
Here, puss, puss, puss.

771
01:04:11,285 --> 01:04:15,164
Here, kitty. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty...

772
01:04:30,965 --> 01:04:34,355
- What did you do with my cat?
- You're letting the heat out.

773
01:04:36,525 --> 01:04:40,837
l know something happened. lnstead
of playing this game, what happened?

774
01:04:40,925 --> 01:04:44,235
- You killed your cat, Barbara.
- What?

775
01:04:45,725 --> 01:04:50,116
Yes. One damn Dalmane and
your kitty would be alive.

776
01:04:50,205 --> 01:04:55,518
l had to get up in the middle ofthe night,
looking for Sominex, and l backed out the...

777
01:05:16,165 --> 01:05:18,554
That supposed to scare me?

778
01:05:22,405 --> 01:05:25,283
lf you're looking for trouble,
Barbara, you found it!

779
01:06:02,485 --> 01:06:06,524
What do you expect?
You killed my cat! You're making me nuts!

780
01:06:06,605 --> 01:06:08,880
Will you please...? l'm asking you to leave!

781
01:06:10,005 --> 01:06:12,394
No, it's my house,

782
01:06:12,485 --> 01:06:15,283
and l'm going to stay.

783
01:06:34,645 --> 01:06:38,479
Frankly, l'm concerned about
you, Oliver. You look haggard.

784
01:06:40,565 --> 01:06:42,760
l feel great.

785
01:06:42,845 --> 01:06:46,121
l'll take time off after the Larrabee
confirmation hearings.

786
01:06:46,205 --> 01:06:48,480
Why don't you take time before?

787
01:06:48,765 --> 01:06:52,838
lt's vital to the firm this comes off
without a hitch. l want you at your best.

788
01:06:54,005 --> 01:06:57,600
l'm at my best. l won't let you down.

789
01:06:57,685 --> 01:07:00,199
l'm in fantastic shape.

790
01:07:01,925 --> 01:07:04,075
l thank you so much for caring.

791
01:07:34,725 --> 01:07:37,922
- Mr D'Amato. There's someone in your office.
- Who?

792
01:07:39,245 --> 01:07:41,998
- Use words, Mary Ann.
- Mrs Rose.

793
01:07:42,085 --> 01:07:46,203
l didn't think l should leave her in reception.
What with all the... you know.

794
01:07:46,285 --> 01:07:49,083
Yeah, l know... Yeah, l know!

795
01:07:52,205 --> 01:07:54,480
Barbara.

796
01:07:55,685 --> 01:07:59,997
You really shouldn't be here because
it might be viewed by some as unethical.

797
01:08:00,125 --> 01:08:03,913
Well, l am here... ethical or not.

798
01:08:07,205 --> 01:08:09,514
You don't mind if l tape this

799
01:08:09,605 --> 01:08:13,359
just so no one gets confused
about what was said?

800
01:08:16,445 --> 01:08:18,754
What's on your mind?

801
01:08:19,645 --> 01:08:24,241
Well, since you're the one who
advised Oliver to move back in,

802
01:08:24,325 --> 01:08:26,793
l thought you would
advise him to move out.

803
01:08:27,085 --> 01:08:29,758
Why? Sounds like you two
have things worked out,

804
01:08:29,845 --> 01:08:32,518
with the red areas and the green areas.

805
01:08:32,605 --> 01:08:36,393
Gavin, ever since this thing started,
l've had trouble sleeping.

806
01:08:37,045 --> 01:08:39,764
Most mornings l wake up sobbing.

807
01:08:40,205 --> 01:08:42,321
l'm sorry. That's shitty.

808
01:08:42,885 --> 01:08:46,116
But this morning... l woke up screaming.

809
01:08:47,045 --> 01:08:49,161
And l couldn't stop.

810
01:08:49,245 --> 01:08:53,443
l need this to end. This has to end!

811
01:08:53,885 --> 01:08:56,274
- l suggested selling the house...
- No!

812
01:08:57,285 --> 01:09:00,197
OK. You both seem to agree on that.

813
01:09:00,485 --> 01:09:02,316
Gavin.

814
01:09:02,405 --> 01:09:06,444
l don't have much money,
but l could pay you.

815
01:09:07,805 --> 01:09:10,399
That'd be illegal.

816
01:09:18,765 --> 01:09:20,995
Besides money,

817
01:09:24,285 --> 01:09:28,039
what would it take to get you
to help me, Gavin?

818
01:09:29,205 --> 01:09:32,914
Put your shoes on, Barbara.
l haven't been into feet since '82.

819
01:09:33,005 --> 01:09:35,883
- Have you ever made angry love?
- ls there any other way?

820
01:09:37,885 --> 01:09:40,240
Stop it!

821
01:09:40,325 --> 01:09:43,442
This is ridiculous. Button up!

822
01:09:43,525 --> 01:09:47,837
You wanna settle this? Let's all sit down
and work it out, find some compromise.

823
01:09:48,365 --> 01:09:51,516
- There is no compromise.
- Then l can't help you.

824
01:10:01,005 --> 01:10:02,996
Worth a shot.

825
01:10:11,565 --> 01:10:14,033
You know where l am
if you change your mind.

826
01:10:46,885 --> 01:10:50,844
Sometimes l wonder what might have
happened... if l'd taken her offer.

827
01:10:53,125 --> 01:10:55,116
But l didn't.

828
01:10:57,045 --> 01:11:01,914
l should have seen her toes
in the pit of my crotch as a cry for help.

829
01:11:03,485 --> 01:11:05,476
- Stinking bitch.
- Dumb bastard.

830
01:11:05,565 --> 01:11:07,157
- Slut.
- Scum.

831
01:11:07,245 --> 01:11:09,156
- Filth.
- Faggot.

832
01:11:09,245 --> 01:11:10,997
- Morning, Susan.
- Morning.

833
01:11:17,925 --> 01:11:20,917
- l made you some sandwiches for the trip.
- l'm not hungry.

834
01:11:21,005 --> 01:11:24,520
You may be hungry later.
Why don't you wrap these up?

835
01:11:26,845 --> 01:11:30,599
There's some things l should tell you.
You're going offto college.

836
01:11:30,685 --> 01:11:33,040
- You told me you loved me.
- Yes, l do love you.

837
01:11:33,125 --> 01:11:37,562
And about drugs - don't do 'em. And sex -
don't catch anything. What else is there?

838
01:11:37,645 --> 01:11:40,113
Just... about women.

839
01:11:41,885 --> 01:11:43,876
Don't be led by your emotions.

840
01:11:44,925 --> 01:11:49,794
Just cos you screwed up doesn't mean lwill,
so don't try and put your shit off on me.

841
01:11:49,885 --> 01:11:52,683
Josh. Don't leave like this.

842
01:11:53,365 --> 01:11:57,074
- l'm pissed at you!
- So what do you want to do about it?

843
01:11:57,165 --> 01:11:59,395
You wanna take a swing at me?

844
01:12:00,405 --> 01:12:03,920
ls that gonna make you feel better?
Then go ahead.

845
01:12:13,885 --> 01:12:17,321
What are you and Dad gonna do
to each other once we're not around?

846
01:12:17,405 --> 01:12:19,202
Don't be silly.

847
01:12:19,285 --> 01:12:22,322
Your father and l need some
time alone to work things out.

848
01:12:23,365 --> 01:12:26,243
By the time summer school starts,
we'll have it settled.

849
01:12:26,325 --> 01:12:30,876
Then l'll make a celebration dinner and
l'll bring it up - or you can come here.

850
01:12:30,965 --> 01:12:33,160
We'll work it out.

851
01:12:33,245 --> 01:12:35,440
- You promise?
- Sure.

852
01:12:37,325 --> 01:12:39,555
You know l love you.

853
01:12:40,645 --> 01:12:43,717
- My sweet girl.
- So...

854
01:12:43,805 --> 01:12:45,796
l'll be back for my things.

855
01:12:46,005 --> 01:12:48,599
l will be thinking the best for you.

856
01:12:50,085 --> 01:12:52,076
So long.

857
01:12:52,165 --> 01:12:54,998
- Take care, Susan.
- Goodbye!

858
01:13:01,845 --> 01:13:04,803
- You have a great time, kids.
- Don't worry about us.

859
01:13:04,885 --> 01:13:06,876
Bye!

860
01:13:11,725 --> 01:13:13,716
Here, Bennie.

861
01:13:23,525 --> 01:13:28,519
At 15, l became an evolutionist,
and it all became clear.

862
01:13:28,605 --> 01:13:30,323
We came from mud.

863
01:13:30,405 --> 01:13:35,354
And after 3.8 billion years of evolution,
at our core is still mud.

864
01:13:36,365 --> 01:13:38,595
No divorce lawyer can doubt that.

865
01:13:41,765 --> 01:13:45,883
We can nail her. She's having
a black-tie dinner at 8 o'clock tonight.

866
01:13:45,965 --> 01:13:49,082
The food critic from The Post
called to confirm the time.

867
01:13:49,165 --> 01:13:51,838
She sent me this phoney
exterminator's notice

868
01:13:51,925 --> 01:13:56,077
saying the house is being gassed
for termites, so l'd stay away.

869
01:13:56,165 --> 01:14:00,522
- She can have dinner parties.
- She lied about the exterminator.

870
01:14:00,605 --> 01:14:02,436
She can lie.

871
01:14:02,525 --> 01:14:05,085
She took two of my Staffordshire figures.

872
01:14:05,165 --> 01:14:07,918
Any dealer would give you
at least $1,000 for them.

873
01:14:08,005 --> 01:14:10,473
She is financing her dinner with my things.

874
01:14:10,565 --> 01:14:14,114
l want to file criminal charges
and l want her thrown in jail.

875
01:14:14,725 --> 01:14:19,162
- Unless you have proof, there aren't grounds.
- Wait a minute. Whose side are you on?

876
01:14:19,245 --> 01:14:21,156
Did she get to you?

877
01:14:21,245 --> 01:14:23,713
- Did you bang her?
- Not at all!

878
01:14:25,485 --> 01:14:28,921
She was great. She was a gymnast.

879
01:14:31,525 --> 01:14:33,800
She was?

880
01:14:34,565 --> 01:14:36,760
Yeah.

881
01:14:36,845 --> 01:14:39,075
Look, Oliver...

882
01:14:39,165 --> 01:14:40,996
l lost my train ofthought.

883
01:14:41,085 --> 01:14:43,315
Come on, Gavin. Let's have her arrested.

884
01:14:43,405 --> 01:14:47,921
l don't think you should stay in the house.
Sell the house and divide the proceeds.

885
01:14:48,805 --> 01:14:53,674
No. You're selling me out. You don't
think l got the guts to go to the mat.

886
01:14:53,765 --> 01:14:55,960
You don't want to go to this mat, Oliver.

887
01:14:56,045 --> 01:15:00,641
Look. l respect you, Oliver.
You're a professional. l'm a professional.

888
01:15:00,725 --> 01:15:04,274
As a professional and a friend,
l'm telling you, one way or another,

889
01:15:04,365 --> 01:15:06,799
you're gonna lose. Give it up.

890
01:15:08,125 --> 01:15:10,195
l understand what you're saying.

891
01:15:13,765 --> 01:15:15,756
You're fired.

892
01:15:21,965 --> 01:15:24,525
Now, some ofthe dishes tonight are new.

893
01:15:24,605 --> 01:15:27,244
Some, l've no doubt made for you before.

894
01:15:27,325 --> 01:15:33,082
But they are all my favourite dishes
as you are all my favourite clients.

895
01:15:36,965 --> 01:15:39,479
Hello, darling. Sorry l'm late.

896
01:15:40,165 --> 01:15:44,955
Well, l guess l'd better not sit too close
to anybody because l have a bit of a cold.

897
01:16:01,165 --> 01:16:04,077
Now l guess l'll go in and piss on the fish.

898
01:16:10,965 --> 01:16:14,560
Oliver, these people are my clients.
You are messing with my business.

899
01:16:14,645 --> 01:16:17,637
l have the food editor
from The Postout there.

900
01:16:18,325 --> 01:16:20,520
ls everything all right?

901
01:16:24,205 --> 01:16:28,118
- l would never humiliate you like this.
- You're not equipped to, honey.

902
01:16:36,325 --> 01:16:38,793
Leaving so soon, baby doll? Huh?

903
01:16:39,205 --> 01:16:41,400
A family tiff seems to be developing.

904
01:16:41,485 --> 01:16:46,639
l don't know ifwe should leave, but
l definitely advise skipping the fish course.

905
01:16:57,205 --> 01:16:58,763
No!

906
01:17:06,365 --> 01:17:09,198
What...? What...? What are you doing?!

907
01:17:09,285 --> 01:17:11,674
What...? What are you doing?!

908
01:17:12,845 --> 01:17:15,996
Do you see what she's doing?!
Do you see that?!

909
01:18:23,885 --> 01:18:26,524
Get out ofthe car, hon.

910
01:18:29,085 --> 01:18:31,280
You're gonna have to kill me.

911
01:18:33,725 --> 01:18:35,841
l mean it, Oliver.

912
01:18:35,925 --> 01:18:38,234
You don't have the guts!

913
01:18:38,605 --> 01:18:40,994
Come on. Come on!

914
01:19:10,125 --> 01:19:12,434
This is absurd. lt's just absurd.

915
01:19:31,805 --> 01:19:33,796
OK, the gloves are off.

916
01:19:37,565 --> 01:19:40,398
Look, l don't wanna create a scene.

917
01:19:40,485 --> 01:19:43,522
l mean, l, uh,
live in this neighbourhood, too.

918
01:19:43,605 --> 01:19:45,721
But the gloves are off!

919
01:19:53,005 --> 01:19:54,996
Chickenshit.

920
01:20:14,685 --> 01:20:17,245
Your guests would have loved this.

921
01:20:22,085 --> 01:20:25,122
l expected a little more
imagination from you, Ollie.

922
01:20:30,245 --> 01:20:32,600
Guess l'll go clean up.

923
01:20:53,685 --> 01:20:56,074
Not the Staffordshires.

924
01:20:58,285 --> 01:21:01,675
- You love them as much as l do.
- More.

925
01:21:38,405 --> 01:21:40,600
Don't you touch that.

926
01:21:42,685 --> 01:21:44,676
What are you doing?!

927
01:21:52,405 --> 01:21:54,202
- Give that to me!
- Let go!

928
01:21:54,285 --> 01:21:56,162
Give it to me!

929
01:22:05,805 --> 01:22:07,796
Good night.

930
01:22:27,965 --> 01:22:29,956
Bennie?

931
01:22:31,885 --> 01:22:33,716
Bennie!

932
01:22:36,485 --> 01:22:38,476
Bennie?

933
01:22:46,565 --> 01:22:50,797
The Bermuda high-pressure system is
keeping hot weatherin the Potomac area.

934
01:22:50,885 --> 01:22:52,876
Look fora high today of92 degrees.

935
01:22:52,965 --> 01:22:55,320
Not a good day to do strenuous exercise.

936
01:22:55,405 --> 01:22:58,920
Good advice, especiallyifyou
have respiratoryproblems.

937
01:22:59,005 --> 01:23:01,121
Sara Murphyis at the Pentagon

938
01:23:01,205 --> 01:23:04,595
with a report on whether women
still fiind uniforms sexyformen.

939
01:23:04,685 --> 01:23:07,438
So far, it was a pretty normal
divorce scenario.

940
01:23:07,525 --> 01:23:11,279
A few bruises, some broken dishes,
a pissed-on fish.

941
01:23:11,365 --> 01:23:15,199
But l think you should have
a drink for this next part.

942
01:23:16,725 --> 01:23:21,276
There are two dilemmas...
that rattle the human skull.

943
01:23:23,725 --> 01:23:27,320
How do you hold onto
someone who won't stay?

944
01:23:28,685 --> 01:23:32,473
And how do you get rid of
someone who won't go?

945
01:24:20,245 --> 01:24:23,442
l opened a great old one, to let it breathe.

946
01:24:29,085 --> 01:24:31,394
You look beautiful.

947
01:24:31,885 --> 01:24:34,001
- l feel good.
- l do, too.

948
01:24:34,085 --> 01:24:37,316
The Larrabee confirmation hearing
went very well today.

949
01:24:40,045 --> 01:24:44,960
l was surprised, happily surprised,
by your invitation.

950
01:24:46,645 --> 01:24:50,638
Thank you for the wine.
l hope it's not poisoned.

951
01:25:02,405 --> 01:25:04,396
Same here.

952
01:25:42,605 --> 01:25:45,358
- We've made a mess ofthings, Oliver.
- We sure have.

953
01:25:45,925 --> 01:25:50,043
- l want to start living a normal life again.
- l do too, Barbara.

954
01:25:50,605 --> 01:25:55,633
Sitting here like this, it's...
it's hard to believe we can't be happy.

955
01:25:56,605 --> 01:25:59,836
We can be happy... just not together.

956
01:26:00,725 --> 01:26:03,637
l want to ask you one last time to leave.

957
01:26:05,525 --> 01:26:08,358
l can't do that. l won't.

958
01:26:10,045 --> 01:26:12,479
You make so much money, Oliver.

959
01:26:12,565 --> 01:26:15,204
You can buy another house
and replace everything.

960
01:26:15,405 --> 01:26:17,396
Except you.

961
01:26:18,125 --> 01:26:23,074
You may find this hard to believe...
but l still love you.

962
01:26:23,165 --> 01:26:25,633
l still...

963
01:26:25,725 --> 01:26:27,716
want you.

964
01:26:29,365 --> 01:26:33,995
- l find it hard to believe.
- What you can't believe is l don't want you.

965
01:26:36,205 --> 01:26:39,595
Well, l... Yeah, l have
a problem with that. l mean,

966
01:26:39,685 --> 01:26:41,994
l think l'm a good person, as people go...

967
01:26:44,605 --> 01:26:47,324
What can we do to patch things up?

968
01:26:49,085 --> 01:26:52,077
- l don't know.
- Tell me.

969
01:26:52,165 --> 01:26:54,633
- l can't.
- Please.

970
01:26:54,725 --> 01:26:58,434
- l don't know.
- Please tell me. Please?

971
01:26:58,525 --> 01:27:00,880
- Just tell me.
- Stop it!

972
01:27:03,525 --> 01:27:05,993
l guess you don't wanna talk about it.

973
01:27:06,085 --> 01:27:08,155
No, l don't wanna talk about it.

974
01:27:08,245 --> 01:27:09,963
Oliver,

975
01:27:10,045 --> 01:27:14,755
if you don't get out of here now,
you have no idea how far l'll go.

976
01:27:14,925 --> 01:27:16,916
How far? Tell me.

977
01:27:17,005 --> 01:27:20,236
We've been horrible to each other,
but we had something - we still do.

978
01:27:20,325 --> 01:27:22,555
We haven't passed any point of no return.

979
01:27:23,845 --> 01:27:27,235
- l have.
- l'm not convinced.

980
01:27:27,325 --> 01:27:30,954
Nobody who makes pâté this good
can be all bad.

981
01:27:35,885 --> 01:27:39,195
That depends on what the pâté is made of.

982
01:27:49,085 --> 01:27:51,235
Woof.

983
01:27:59,525 --> 01:28:01,243
Bennie?

984
01:28:04,045 --> 01:28:06,559
A good dog to the last bite.

985
01:28:13,965 --> 01:28:16,399
Goddamn you!

986
01:28:18,405 --> 01:28:20,999
Jesus Christ!

987
01:29:10,045 --> 01:29:12,036
l'll give you the chandelier.

988
01:29:28,165 --> 01:29:29,962
Barbara?

989
01:29:31,325 --> 01:29:32,838
Shit!

990
01:29:32,925 --> 01:29:36,884
You can't get out!
l'm gonna find you, sweetness.

991
01:29:37,325 --> 01:29:39,555
l know this house too well!

992
01:29:40,885 --> 01:29:42,921
Where the hell is she?

993
01:31:08,685 --> 01:31:11,677
l guess l'm on top now. And you're helpless.

994
01:31:12,445 --> 01:31:15,164
l can do anything l want.

995
01:31:15,245 --> 01:31:17,156
Stop it! l mean it! Stop it!

996
01:31:21,885 --> 01:31:24,604
Oh, God. Oh, you smell so dirty-sweet.

997
01:31:26,765 --> 01:31:29,916
Oh, Barbie... Oh, we need this, Barbie. Yeah...

998
01:31:30,005 --> 01:31:31,961
No, don't talk!

999
01:31:32,045 --> 01:31:34,275
Don't talk. Oliver,

1000
01:31:35,165 --> 01:31:39,443
l want to say hello
to the bald avenger. Please.

1001
01:31:42,445 --> 01:31:44,595
You haven't called him that in years.

1002
01:31:47,405 --> 01:31:50,317
Oh, Barbara! Oh, Barbara! Oh!

1003
01:31:52,125 --> 01:31:54,116
Oh, yes!

1004
01:31:57,845 --> 01:31:59,836
Oh, Barbara...

1005
01:32:04,805 --> 01:32:06,796
Oh, God!

1006
01:32:22,165 --> 01:32:24,315
Was it as good for you as it was for me?

1007
01:33:06,445 --> 01:33:08,561
Oh, what's going on here?

1008
01:33:42,325 --> 01:33:44,361
Oh, l'm sorry.

1009
01:33:44,445 --> 01:33:46,481
l thought you were Barbara.

1010
01:33:47,165 --> 01:33:50,714
Mr Rose, what's going on here? Are you OK?

1011
01:33:51,565 --> 01:33:53,920
l'm... l'm fine. Fine.

1012
01:33:54,925 --> 01:33:56,722
Listen, Susan,

1013
01:33:56,805 --> 01:34:01,003
l'm in the middle of something now.
l... l... l really can't talk about it.

1014
01:34:01,085 --> 01:34:02,996
Let me get the door for you.

1015
01:34:03,085 --> 01:34:06,555
- ls Mrs Rose all right?
- Yes, she's fine.

1016
01:34:07,605 --> 01:34:11,075
Where is she? ls she OK?
You're sure she's all right?

1017
01:34:11,165 --> 01:34:14,635
Barbara. Susan's here!

1018
01:34:14,725 --> 01:34:18,161
- She wants to know ifyou're OK.
- Never better.

1019
01:34:22,365 --> 01:34:24,640
Thank you for dropping by, Susan.

1020
01:34:25,405 --> 01:34:27,680
Come outside with me, Mr Rose.

1021
01:34:27,765 --> 01:34:29,756
Let's go.

1022
01:34:33,845 --> 01:34:35,995
Wait a minute. l forgot something.

1023
01:34:36,685 --> 01:34:38,641
What?

1024
01:34:38,725 --> 01:34:40,716
- Barbara.
- No!

1025
01:34:40,805 --> 01:34:43,524
Mr Rose! Mr Rose!

1026
01:34:44,725 --> 01:34:46,716
Oh, no!

1027
01:34:49,245 --> 01:34:52,476
Oh, mein Gott. Mrs Rose!

1028
01:35:45,045 --> 01:35:47,400
What fresh hell is this?

1029
01:36:20,925 --> 01:36:22,916
Hi.

1030
01:36:25,325 --> 01:36:27,600
l brought you a surprise.

1031
01:37:16,485 --> 01:37:18,282
You are ajerk.

1032
01:37:25,045 --> 01:37:27,036
l'll tell you what.

1033
01:37:28,485 --> 01:37:30,919
You say it's mine

1034
01:37:31,005 --> 01:37:33,838
and you can have everything in this house.

1035
01:37:35,405 --> 01:37:37,316
OK.

1036
01:37:37,405 --> 01:37:39,123
lt's mine.

1037
01:38:14,965 --> 01:38:18,719
Barbara! Barbara, l'm sorry.
Are you all right? You OK?

1038
01:38:18,805 --> 01:38:19,954
You OK?

1039
01:39:02,525 --> 01:39:04,800
Well, well, well!

1040
01:39:08,125 --> 01:39:12,004
l'd be glad to help you...
in exchange for the house.

1041
01:39:13,045 --> 01:39:14,524
No.

1042
01:39:14,605 --> 01:39:18,359
Please don't break
the terrazzo floor when you land.

1043
01:39:26,165 --> 01:39:28,520
Oh! That's better.

1044
01:39:34,405 --> 01:39:37,636
l'm gonna save you whether you like it or not.

1045
01:39:37,725 --> 01:39:40,000
That won't work.

1046
01:39:40,645 --> 01:39:43,034
lt's too heavy. lt'll pull you off.

1047
01:39:43,325 --> 01:39:45,714
lt'll work.

1048
01:40:02,405 --> 01:40:03,724
Oliver!

1049
01:40:20,125 --> 01:40:22,116
Almost.

1050
01:40:23,605 --> 01:40:25,994
All right. All right.

1051
01:40:27,405 --> 01:40:30,283
l think l can swing this over to the balcony.

1052
01:40:30,365 --> 01:40:32,481
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

1053
01:40:34,685 --> 01:40:38,394
l loosened the bolt.
l was gonna drop it on you.

1054
01:40:39,605 --> 01:40:41,880
Ooh, that's a good one.

1055
01:40:47,605 --> 01:40:49,675
Gavin! Gavin!

1056
01:40:50,845 --> 01:40:54,520
- Gavin...
- Uh, Susan, let me stop the car first!

1057
01:40:54,605 --> 01:40:57,722
Thank God you're here!
l thought you'd never arrive.

1058
01:40:57,805 --> 01:41:00,160
They're in there. They're over the edge!

1059
01:41:01,805 --> 01:41:06,720
l guess at this point, there's no reason
to be anything but absolutely honest.

1060
01:41:07,845 --> 01:41:12,043
Through all that's happened...
l always loved you.

1061
01:41:14,765 --> 01:41:16,756
l know.

1062
01:41:19,085 --> 01:41:21,804
And through all this,

1063
01:41:21,885 --> 01:41:24,240
you loved me too, didn't you?

1064
01:41:32,365 --> 01:41:34,595
Get that, would you, Oliver?

1065
01:41:37,085 --> 01:41:40,236
- No?
- No, no. OK, we go in.

1066
01:41:43,765 --> 01:41:45,278
Oh, mein Gott.

1067
01:41:46,085 --> 01:41:48,724
Oliver! Barbara!

1068
01:41:48,805 --> 01:41:50,363
- Gavin!
- Gavin!

1069
01:41:50,685 --> 01:41:53,882
- Gavin, get a ladder!
- OK!

1070
01:41:57,845 --> 01:42:00,154
l knew everything would be all right.

1071
01:42:08,165 --> 01:42:09,678
Gavin!

1072
01:42:12,045 --> 01:42:14,957
- Gavin!
- Gavin!

1073
01:42:22,165 --> 01:42:25,362
We're gonna be all right.
You see those two wires?

1074
01:42:25,445 --> 01:42:26,639
Yeah.

1075
01:42:26,845 --> 01:42:31,043
Each ofthem can hold... at least 200 pounds.

1076
01:43:41,725 --> 01:43:43,920
We're coming!

1077
01:44:43,605 --> 01:44:46,483
Mein Gott. They are dead.

1078
01:45:07,005 --> 01:45:08,916
Some story, huh?

1079
01:45:13,645 --> 01:45:16,318
What's the moral?

1080
01:45:16,405 --> 01:45:20,398
Other than dog people should marry
dog people and cat people, cat people.

1081
01:45:22,765 --> 01:45:25,438
l don't know.

1082
01:45:25,525 --> 01:45:27,993
lt could be just this:

1083
01:45:28,085 --> 01:45:31,964
a civilised divorce
is a contradiction in terms.

1084
01:45:33,885 --> 01:45:37,195
Maybe because ofwhat happened,
l've become too traditional.

1085
01:45:37,285 --> 01:45:41,073
Maybe it's not natural to stay
married to one person for life.

1086
01:45:41,725 --> 01:45:43,920
My parents did it.

1087
01:45:44,005 --> 01:45:45,996
63 years.

1088
01:45:46,605 --> 01:45:49,199
A few of 'em good!

1089
01:45:52,565 --> 01:45:54,954
So, look. Here it is.

1090
01:45:55,045 --> 01:45:57,718
We can begin.

1091
01:45:57,805 --> 01:45:59,796
When it comes to your wife,

1092
01:45:59,885 --> 01:46:05,164
l'm going to urge you to be generous
to the point of night sweats.

1093
01:46:06,085 --> 01:46:11,398
The all-important thing is to get you through
this as quickly and cleanly as possible

1094
01:46:11,485 --> 01:46:14,522
so that you can begin rebuilding your life.

1095
01:46:14,605 --> 01:46:16,596
OK?

1096
01:46:19,085 --> 01:46:21,076
Or...

1097
01:46:23,525 --> 01:46:25,675
you can get up

1098
01:46:25,765 --> 01:46:27,995
and go home,

1099
01:46:28,085 --> 01:46:32,078
and try to find some shred

1100
01:46:32,165 --> 01:46:36,238
of what you once loved about
the sweetheart ofyour youth.

1101
01:46:41,445 --> 01:46:43,436
lt's your life.

1102
01:46:46,245 --> 01:46:48,475
Take a minute.

1103
01:47:23,165 --> 01:47:26,794
Hi, what are you doing?
l'm coming home. Love you. Bye.

1104
