I'm not your sister,
I'm not your girlfriend,

[ Clucking ]

So if you wanna remain my partner,
I've got two words for you.

for me at all.

Moving.

Why did you call cut? I did not
tell you to stop acting, Urkel.

160
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:45,401
Wolf, how many times
have I told you
not to call me Urkel?

161

My name is Jaleel White, okay?

162
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:51,748
Urkel was a character
I played when I was a child.

Okay,Jaleel.
Hey, what's the problem?

Yeah.

Mmm. Okay, you're
a police officer named Fowl.

Your new partner is a crime-fighting
chicken named Whitaker.

is a nice fat paycheck

window at McDonald's.

Watch yourself.

No, you watch yourself, pal.

You're just lucky I'm not making you
wear the freaky glasses and suspenders.

174
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,248
I swear. I was riding down
the street on Jamie's old bike
and some limo hit me.

175
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:36,420
They offered me a ride.
I spilled all my stuff.
I must've forgotten the paper.

why we should believe you.

Because it's true!

There was some guy in
the limo. Marty something.
Maybe he took it.

What are our options?

Jason, you must've made
at least one friend.

193

Yeah, come to think of it,
the kid behind me who kept
flicking boogers at my neck,

a really nice guy.

I shouldn't even be
in that stupid summer school.

If it makes you feel any better,

They're going on a river rafting

But do I get an adventure? No.

at my Grandma Pearl's
