1
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:01,818
Oh, God, it's a fire!

2
00:02:04,265 --> 00:02:05,596
Fire!

3
00:02:14,942 --> 00:02:16,603
A jackhammer?

4
00:02:17,045 --> 00:02:20,708
On Saturday? He should be castrated.

5
00:02:23,651 --> 00:02:25,118
Saturday.

6
00:02:25,987 --> 00:02:30,447
Oh, God. Oh, God, it's Saturday.
Get up! Get up!

7
00:02:30,792 --> 00:02:33,386
Get up, get up, get up!

8
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,525
My sister's gonna kill me.

9
00:02:38,499 --> 00:02:41,024
Oh, my God, what did we do last night?

10
00:02:41,235 --> 00:02:42,532
The usual.

11
00:02:42,737 --> 00:02:47,140
Collected money for the poor little
homeless children at the church bazaar.

12
00:02:47,341 --> 00:02:50,242
I think the vicar must
have spiked the Kool-Aid.

13
00:02:50,812 --> 00:02:52,302
We are way late!

14
00:02:53,147 --> 00:02:54,978
What am I gonna tell my sister?

15
00:02:56,017 --> 00:02:57,484
Is this yours or mine?

16
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:02,753
-Oh, my God, how did that happen?
-I haven't a clue.

17
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:06,255
There's my excuse. I'm late
because my tits caught on fire.

18
00:03:07,095 --> 00:03:08,187
Come on!

19
00:03:15,903 --> 00:03:17,894
Find a cab! Taxi!

20
00:03:18,106 --> 00:03:21,234
-Hey, cab!
-Right there! Get him.

21
00:03:22,176 --> 00:03:24,167
Can you go a little faster, please?

22
00:03:26,881 --> 00:03:29,679
Fast and alive. Alive, all right?

23
00:03:29,884 --> 00:03:32,751
The alive part is
incredibly important in this case.

24
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:36,780
You all right, darling?

25
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,192
Oh, God, I could care less.

26
00:03:39,393 --> 00:03:40,621
That's the whole point.

27
00:03:40,862 --> 00:03:42,796
Right. To care less.

28
00:03:47,368 --> 00:03:51,134
This is tasting like cherry brandy
because I haven't got her gift.

29
00:03:53,407 --> 00:03:55,875
Thank God forbar cars.

30
00:04:05,086 --> 00:04:06,781
You're late!

31
00:04:07,155 --> 00:04:08,952
Jasper, this is...

32
00:04:09,991 --> 00:04:12,585
...a bridesmaid
with makeup and a dress.

33
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,261
Really late. Like, 45 minutes.

34
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:18,660
She has absolutely no sense of humor,
but she's really good at telling time.

35
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,489
I am so sorry.

36
00:04:20,701 --> 00:04:24,467
There was a water main break
and the train got stuck in Rye.

37
00:04:24,672 --> 00:04:27,470
An electrical thingy.
And just, explosion--

38
00:04:27,675 --> 00:04:29,074
Gwen.

39
00:04:34,248 --> 00:04:37,740
You make it impossible to love you.

40
00:04:47,195 --> 00:04:48,492
Shit!

41
00:05:05,446 --> 00:05:09,883
May we present
Mr. and Mrs. Andrew Topton?

42
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:12,948
Like one?

43
00:05:13,154 --> 00:05:15,645
Did you think it was
a pretty wedding? I did.

44
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,222
Wasn't it pretty?

45
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:20,393
Yeah, but no one wants pretty
anymore from a wedding.

46
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:25,326
They want a scandal.
They want to take home a story.

47
00:05:25,967 --> 00:05:27,127
Try these.

48
00:05:29,136 --> 00:05:32,867
This is a party. Let's have some fun
with it, for God's sake.

49
00:05:40,147 --> 00:05:42,081
Oh, my God!

50
00:05:42,316 --> 00:05:44,409
-What happened?
-You--!

51
00:05:44,852 --> 00:05:47,787
Possibly crank it up a little?
Liven everything up.

52
00:05:47,989 --> 00:05:50,116
There's a ladies' room
right over there.

53
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:18,946
Settle down, buddy!

54
00:06:19,854 --> 00:06:20,843
Oh, sorry.

55
00:06:56,223 --> 00:06:57,884
Don't worry. I'll replace it.

56
00:07:00,895 --> 00:07:02,556
I'll be right back.

57
00:07:21,282 --> 00:07:24,183
Hey, lady! Hey, lady,
what are you doing?

58
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:31,458
Cake store. Cake store. Cake store.

59
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:53,269
This is Helga. What city?

60
00:07:53,481 --> 00:07:55,506
Yes, Bedford.

61
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,072
A cake store.

62
00:08:00,821 --> 00:08:04,780
Lady, if I knew the name,
I wouldn't have called you, okay?

63
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,589
Oh, God!

64
00:08:55,443 --> 00:08:56,774
This is perfect.

65
00:09:00,181 --> 00:09:03,014
All right, everybody.
Now, circle up.

66
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,442
That's it.

67
00:09:04,685 --> 00:09:05,674
Come on.

68
00:09:07,021 --> 00:09:08,886
Together, we're better!

69
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,285
We're better together!

70
00:09:11,525 --> 00:09:13,925
No drugs!

71
00:09:18,032 --> 00:09:19,693
That judge totally screwed me.

72
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,832
Good morning!

73
00:09:21,035 --> 00:09:23,265
I should've picked
that rehab in th e city.

74
00:09:24,038 --> 00:09:25,027
People chant.

75
00:09:25,239 --> 00:09:26,672
-They do what?
-They chant.

76
00:09:26,874 --> 00:09:29,968
They think I'm chanting, they have
a whole 'nother thing coming.

77
00:09:30,211 --> 00:09:32,441
It could be worse. Could be prison.

78
00:09:32,646 --> 00:09:34,170
Oh, that's worse?

79
00:09:34,381 --> 00:09:37,111
You never hear of being raped
with a plunger in rehab.

80
00:09:37,318 --> 00:09:39,149
Because they cover it up.

81
00:09:40,588 --> 00:09:41,919
It's not funny!

82
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,556
Excuse me. Talking.

83
00:09:43,757 --> 00:09:44,985
No cell phones.

84
00:09:45,226 --> 00:09:48,161
Gwen C., I'm Betty. Follow me.

85
00:09:49,396 --> 00:09:52,058
We carry our own bags here.
This isn't the Sheraton.

86
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:57,733
Oh, glass. In case I slit my wrists.
I get it.

87
00:09:58,506 --> 00:09:59,700
An eyelash curler.

88
00:09:59,907 --> 00:10:03,343
What'll I do with that? Stab myself?
Curl my tongue to death?

89
00:10:04,678 --> 00:10:07,613
While you're going through my stuff,
let's see...

90
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,339
...what Betty's got in her drawers.

91
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,412
Oh, my God.
Betty has locked her drawers.

92
00:10:16,257 --> 00:10:17,849
What? It's for my back pain.

93
00:10:20,261 --> 00:10:23,025
These things will be returned
to you when you check out.

94
00:10:23,264 --> 00:10:26,529
Except for the Vickodin,
which will be flushed.

95
00:10:26,767 --> 00:10:27,597
Smile!

96
00:10:27,801 --> 00:10:29,166
It's "Vicodin."

97
00:10:29,937 --> 00:10:33,634
No calls, except during posted
phone time and only for 1 0 minutes.

98
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:38,369
No fraternization. That's romance
andlor sex between patients.

99
00:10:38,612 --> 00:10:41,240
Oh, and we chant here.
Don't be put off by it.

100
00:10:41,448 --> 00:10:44,008
Some people prefer it
to the Serenity Prayer.

101
00:10:44,218 --> 00:10:46,812
I'll be your friend

102
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:51,151
I'll help you carry on

103
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:56,157
Forit won't be long

104
00:10:56,363 --> 00:11:00,129
Till I'm gonna need somebody--

105
00:11:00,334 --> 00:11:01,699
Your room.

106
00:11:02,236 --> 00:11:04,761
You're responsible
for keeping it clean.

107
00:11:04,972 --> 00:11:06,337
Andrea, this is Gwen.

108
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,030
Settle her in.

109
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:14,105
-Do you watch Santa Cruz?
-Pardon me?

110
00:11:14,315 --> 00:11:16,010
Santa Cruz. It's my soap.

111
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:19,709
They only let us watch TV at night,
so I've missed the last two weeks.

112
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,717
Hey, an intellectual.

113
00:11:22,323 --> 00:11:25,656
Like the stuff you did to get you
in here was real brain food.

114
00:11:30,164 --> 00:11:33,361
Parker House people, this is Gwen.
Gwen, this is everybody.

115
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:34,932
Hello, Gwen.

116
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,094
I'm thinking booze.

117
00:11:38,172 --> 00:11:39,070
Cocaine.

118
00:11:39,273 --> 00:11:40,399
Painkillers.

119
00:11:40,608 --> 00:11:42,906
-This is not a nice game.
-Well?

120
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,634
Well, what?

121
00:11:44,845 --> 00:11:47,814
What's your drug of choice?

122
00:11:48,015 --> 00:11:51,507
Alcohol, cocaine, Percodan,
heroin, glue?

123
00:11:51,719 --> 00:11:52,777
I have to pick one?

124
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,181
Your gateway drug.
What you go for first.

125
00:11:56,156 --> 00:11:57,145
I guess I drink.

126
00:11:57,358 --> 00:11:59,189
Yes. Come to Papa.

127
00:11:59,627 --> 00:12:02,187
Hand them over.
I know people, admit that.

128
00:12:02,463 --> 00:12:03,828
Get your thumb out of that.

129
00:12:06,667 --> 00:12:07,656
What's the matter?

130
00:12:08,035 --> 00:12:10,697
Haven't you ever seen
a trach scar before?

131
00:12:11,138 --> 00:12:13,402
It's a tracheostomy.
It's not a growth.

132
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:17,543
It's not a deformity. It's a scar.
So you can stop staring at it.

133
00:12:18,245 --> 00:12:19,940
Okay, good. Thank you.

134
00:12:20,147 --> 00:12:21,808
She wasn't staring, Daniel.

135
00:12:22,049 --> 00:12:24,847
No? And how would you know, faggot?

136
00:12:26,253 --> 00:12:28,448
You're about as perceptive
as Helen Keller.

137
00:12:28,656 --> 00:12:32,148
When you think about it,
Helen Keller was pretty perceptive.

138
00:12:32,393 --> 00:12:33,951
Shut up!

139
00:12:34,161 --> 00:12:37,653
Look at him walk away!
Run away! Run away!

140
00:12:37,898 --> 00:12:41,698
We were up in heaven
Now we're in th e mud

141
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:46,663
We fell off th e wagon
Yo u should have heard th e th ud

142
00:12:46,907 --> 00:12:48,101
-I like your coat.
-Thanks.

143
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,606
-Is that leather?
-Yes.

144
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,437
-Not vinyl?
-Nope.

145
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:53,272
-You believe in killing animals?
-Yes.

146
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,344
-For clothing?
-Yes.

147
00:12:54,581 --> 00:12:55,411
So do l.

148
00:12:55,616 --> 00:12:57,880
For 28 boring days

149
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:01,754
Don't worry about Daniel.

150
00:13:01,955 --> 00:13:05,823
He's just self-conscious about
his neck because he did it to himself.

151
00:13:06,026 --> 00:13:10,395
He had this thing where he'd pump his
stomach so he wouldn't get a hangover.

152
00:13:10,597 --> 00:13:14,897
I guess he knew how, because,
you know, he's a doctor. Or was.

153
00:13:15,102 --> 00:13:18,833
He lost his license after
he killed that patient, but....

154
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:23,567
Anyway, I guess one night while he was
scraping that tube to his stomach...

155
00:13:23,777 --> 00:13:27,269
...somehow he screwed up and he
couldn't breathe and he had to...

156
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:34,048
...poke a hole in his throat
with a pen or something.

157
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,852
Jasper, see ifyou can
dig up some Vicodin.

158
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:41,027
Th e gestapo fo und my first batch.

159
00:13:41,228 --> 00:13:43,389
That here-but-not-here illusion
will be...

160
00:13:43,597 --> 00:13:46,395
...much easier to sustain
with chemical help.

161
00:13:46,633 --> 00:13:48,157
Love, Gwennie.

162
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:49,529
Good night.

163
00:13:49,803 --> 00:13:50,792
Good night.

164
00:14:14,194 --> 00:14:17,561
Chocolate. Heroin addict.

165
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:19,991
What are you, like, 1 2 or something?

166
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:21,925
Seventeen.

167
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,402
Loving this.

168
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:26,828
Good night.

169
00:15:05,212 --> 00:15:08,272
Jeremiah was a bullfrog

170
00:15:08,482 --> 00:15:11,178
Jeremiah was a bullfrog

171
00:15:12,252 --> 00:15:14,277
Was a good friend ofmine

172
00:15:14,488 --> 00:15:17,582
I never understood
A single word he said

173
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,988
But I help ed him drink his wine

174
00:15:21,595 --> 00:15:24,462
And he always had
Some mighty fine wine

175
00:15:28,569 --> 00:15:31,504
Singingjoy to th e world

176
00:15:32,773 --> 00:15:34,536
You girls are a lot of fun.

177
00:15:34,741 --> 00:15:36,834
And that's the most important thing.

178
00:15:37,077 --> 00:15:38,977
Because if you're not having fun....

179
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:42,478
What's the frigging point?!

180
00:15:45,686 --> 00:15:47,244
Oh, God.

181
00:15:53,794 --> 00:15:56,729
You can keep your drugs
and your whiskey sours.

182
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:59,364
We got us a higher power!

183
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,864
Yay, God!

184
00:16:05,939 --> 00:16:08,305
Don't forget
tonight's lecture at 8:30:

185
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:11,945
"How Many Brain Cells
Did I Kill Last Night?"

186
00:16:13,947 --> 00:16:15,175
Decaf.

187
00:16:15,382 --> 00:16:18,180
There's no caffeine.
It's mood-altering.

188
00:16:21,822 --> 00:16:22,914
Hi.

189
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:26,255
That was a nice moment.
Where you going?

190
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:29,020
What do you mean?
You gotta have cigarettes.

191
00:16:29,229 --> 00:16:30,821
Sorry, but we're fresh out.

192
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:34,228
Those people are addicts. They need
cigarettes like they need air.

193
00:16:34,468 --> 00:16:38,404
I guess that explains it, then. Gum?

194
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,571
It wasn't a problem...

195
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:53,679
...till Emmett, he took up
with that girl.

196
00:16:54,254 --> 00:16:57,280
Those nights that he was
out with her...

197
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:00,322
...and I was home with the TV....

198
00:17:00,594 --> 00:17:04,086
See, I figured we could
see it through.

199
00:17:05,332 --> 00:17:07,061
So when he said...

200
00:17:07,267 --> 00:17:09,861
...he was moving her in with us...

201
00:17:11,204 --> 00:17:13,729
...and that I could stay or leave...

202
00:17:15,542 --> 00:17:18,272
...l see now I should've left.

203
00:17:18,512 --> 00:17:20,275
I've got something....

204
00:17:22,683 --> 00:17:24,617
When you....

205
00:17:33,527 --> 00:17:34,926
You want to do it later?

206
00:17:35,128 --> 00:17:36,686
I think, yeah.

207
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,189
Why did you--?

208
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,760
Some feeling words in there, or...?

209
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:46,470
-You know?
-"l...."

210
00:17:49,409 --> 00:17:51,639
I don't know how to explain.

211
00:17:51,878 --> 00:17:55,211
All right. Okay, well,
that's a good start.

212
00:17:55,749 --> 00:17:57,307
Another time. It's all right.

213
00:17:58,719 --> 00:18:02,382
So let's finish up today
with a prayer, all right?

214
00:18:02,589 --> 00:18:04,386
Let's all hold hands.

215
00:18:08,061 --> 00:18:10,757
God, grant me the serenity...

216
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:14,798
...to accept the things
I cannot change...

217
00:18:15,002 --> 00:18:18,995
...the courage to change
the things I can...

218
00:18:19,239 --> 00:18:22,402
...and the wisdom to know
the difference.

219
00:18:23,243 --> 00:18:27,509
It works if you work it.
It's worth it!

220
00:18:27,748 --> 00:18:29,238
All right!

221
00:18:30,751 --> 00:18:32,776
Take on the day. Go ahead.

222
00:18:33,887 --> 00:18:35,115
B-minus.

223
00:18:35,455 --> 00:18:37,252
Hey, Gwen C.!

224
00:18:37,524 --> 00:18:40,493
Your bed was not made up,
your clothes were all over.

225
00:18:40,694 --> 00:18:44,528
I'm giving you an F for daily
inspection and fining you a dollar.

226
00:18:44,731 --> 00:18:46,028
So pay up.

227
00:18:46,366 --> 00:18:47,628
Tell you what.

228
00:18:48,101 --> 00:18:51,400
Here's five dollars.
I don't plan on cleaning all week.

229
00:18:53,573 --> 00:18:54,904
Bitch.

230
00:19:26,239 --> 00:19:27,228
How you doing?

231
00:19:28,075 --> 00:19:29,167
Good.

232
00:19:29,609 --> 00:19:32,077
I don't know how much money
I have in my account...

233
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:34,509
...but it's yours
if I could bum a cigarette.

234
00:19:35,415 --> 00:19:36,575
Sure.

235
00:19:37,751 --> 00:19:38,945
They're Reds.

236
00:19:40,353 --> 00:19:41,513
Thank you.

237
00:19:53,867 --> 00:19:55,095
Been here long?

238
00:19:56,269 --> 00:19:57,361
Yeah.

239
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:03,167
What's the deal here if somebody
was looking for something...

240
00:20:03,376 --> 00:20:05,469
...with a little more kick
than nicotine?

241
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,239
Do people actually get stuff here,
or is it...?

242
00:20:08,715 --> 00:20:09,704
It happens.

243
00:20:10,984 --> 00:20:13,680
How does it work?
I mean, how can you get stuff?

244
00:20:13,887 --> 00:20:16,219
Can you get stuff,
or is it, like...?

245
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:19,290
If your counselor catches you using,
you can get kicked out.

246
00:20:19,493 --> 00:20:22,758
I don't plan on discussing it
with him.

247
00:20:23,864 --> 00:20:24,990
Too late.

248
00:20:27,634 --> 00:20:30,432
Generally, people come to rehab
not to get loaded.

249
00:20:30,637 --> 00:20:33,606
Well, I try not to run with the pack.

250
00:20:33,807 --> 00:20:35,536
You're a real individual.

251
00:20:35,742 --> 00:20:38,472
You're the only person
who does drugs and alcohol.

252
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:41,839
I meant what I said.

253
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:44,842
You get caught using,
you risk getting kicked out.

254
00:20:45,051 --> 00:20:47,212
Fair enough. We done?

255
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,980
And believe me,
I'll know if you're using.

256
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,555
You always this charming?

257
00:20:51,758 --> 00:20:54,625
You always use humor to
deflect things when you're uneasy?

258
00:20:54,828 --> 00:20:58,025
Do you always use insight
to disarm your new recruits?

259
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:03,034
-What's that?
-It's literature about your disease.

260
00:21:04,337 --> 00:21:06,430
AA Big Book, some worksheets.

261
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,835
A journal I want you
to write in every day.

262
00:21:09,042 --> 00:21:10,839
I suppose I have to do this.

263
00:21:11,044 --> 00:21:13,308
You got better things to do
with your time?

264
00:21:14,881 --> 00:21:16,348
Hey, listen.

265
00:21:16,983 --> 00:21:19,213
This isn't the last lousy day
you'll have here.

266
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:22,918
So remember, God never dumps
more on us than we can handle.

267
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:25,553
Is that available stitched
on a pillow?

268
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:32,496
Tonight's lecture: "A re Yo u A Blackout
Drunk, OrDon't Yo u Remember?. "

269
00:21:35,468 --> 00:21:36,560
You going down?

270
00:21:38,038 --> 00:21:41,667
My problem is, my father just
happened to watch Dateline...

271
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:44,241
...the night they're doing
some expos_...

272
00:21:44,477 --> 00:21:48,038
...on Park Avenue drug users...

273
00:21:48,248 --> 00:21:50,773
...the night he caught me
doing blow in the bathroom.

274
00:21:50,984 --> 00:21:53,885
But I don't have a problem.
I don't have health problems.

275
00:21:54,087 --> 00:21:56,078
I play Ultimate Frisbee
two times a week.

276
00:21:56,323 --> 00:22:00,851
And I'm, you know, a patron of the
arts, and diseases and cures and stuff.

277
00:22:01,061 --> 00:22:05,088
That's what I spend my money on.
So I like to have a little bit of fun.

278
00:22:05,332 --> 00:22:08,597
"A dult Children OfAlcoholics"
is moved to 9 p.m. in ro om 8.

279
00:22:09,169 --> 00:22:11,103
CoDA starts at 8 p.m. in B.

280
00:22:11,338 --> 00:22:13,602
CAs and NA s meet tomorro w...

281
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,104
...and overeaters, sexual addicts....

282
00:22:16,343 --> 00:22:19,710
Who the hell do you have to know
to get a drink around here?

283
00:22:21,248 --> 00:22:22,340
Oh, God.

284
00:22:28,855 --> 00:22:31,187
Oh, my God, I love you so much.

285
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:37,496
-Where are all the celebrities?
-There are none.

286
00:22:37,697 --> 00:22:38,925
What? Come on.

287
00:22:39,132 --> 00:22:42,499
All anyone wants from rehab's
a good coked-out star story.

288
00:22:42,702 --> 00:22:47,605
Elizabeth Taylor, weeping in group
about how she never felt beautiful.

289
00:22:47,807 --> 00:22:52,210
Never. Not one single day.
Now, that's the story they want.

290
00:22:53,113 --> 00:22:55,980
-I'll get you out of here.
-I'm not supposed to leave.

291
00:22:56,216 --> 00:22:58,582
You're not supposed to have
Mummy's Little Helper, either.

292
00:22:58,785 --> 00:23:00,275
Hold on, hold on.

293
00:23:02,322 --> 00:23:03,516
Okay, go.

294
00:23:04,991 --> 00:23:07,482
Be very, very quiet. I'm hiding.

295
00:23:07,727 --> 00:23:09,661
Be very, very quiet.

296
00:23:15,101 --> 00:23:20,004
Drunk men stagger, drunk men fall
Drunk men swearand that's not all

297
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,142
Quite often th ey will urinate outdoors

298
00:23:24,411 --> 00:23:26,811
Like widowed women, drunk men weep

299
00:23:27,013 --> 00:23:29,208
Like children curled up
Drunk men sleep

300
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:33,580
Like a dog, a drunk will
Crawl aro und on all fo urs

301
00:23:34,154 --> 00:23:38,386
Ifyou're broke bum orrich rake
His dinnerbe it bread or cake

302
00:23:38,591 --> 00:23:43,528
His beverage be th e worst of whiskey
Finest wine

303
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:49,401
Puke, it stinks, and so it seems
That drunkards go to great extremes

304
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:53,265
Th ere is yet to be
A perfectly straight line

305
00:23:54,207 --> 00:23:55,765
Hi, everybody.

306
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,214
So what's the deal? I'm out?

307
00:24:02,716 --> 00:24:05,651
It'll take me a day to
arrange your transfer.

308
00:24:05,852 --> 00:24:08,116
I know where I want to go.
This place in the city--

309
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:11,347
I'm not referring you
to a treatment facility.

310
00:24:12,459 --> 00:24:13,790
I get to go home?

311
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:15,787
Nope.

312
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:19,225
Where am I going, then?

313
00:24:19,466 --> 00:24:23,459
Your sentence was
for 28 days of rehab or jail time.

314
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:26,901
You don't honestly think
I'm going to jail, do you?

315
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:32,177
For driving drunk, hitting a lawn jockey
that could've been a 4-year-old child?

316
00:24:32,412 --> 00:24:35,848
But it wasn't.
It was a 4-year-old lawn jockey.

317
00:24:36,049 --> 00:24:39,485
That's fine if this is all a big joke,
but in here we have rules.

318
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:42,621
And I warned you about them.
Pack your bags by morning.

319
00:24:43,256 --> 00:24:46,248
No, I'm not.
Because I don't belong in jail.

320
00:24:46,493 --> 00:24:48,654
I don't even belong in here.

321
00:24:49,829 --> 00:24:52,127
You know, yeah, I know I drink a lot.

322
00:24:52,332 --> 00:24:55,165
I'm a writer,
and that's what I do, we drink.

323
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:57,199
Cornell Shaw for Clancy, please.

324
00:24:57,404 --> 00:24:59,736
I'm not like those people.
I can control myself.

325
00:24:59,939 --> 00:25:01,566
No, I'll hold.

326
00:25:01,775 --> 00:25:06,075
If I wanted to, I could.
If that's what I wanted. I could.

327
00:25:07,347 --> 00:25:08,336
I can.

328
00:25:09,849 --> 00:25:11,339
I can!

329
00:25:14,287 --> 00:25:15,549
You know what?

330
00:25:15,755 --> 00:25:18,417
Forget that, Mr. Rogers,
you 1 2-stepping geek.

331
00:25:18,625 --> 00:25:19,956
What do you know about me?

332
00:25:20,193 --> 00:25:24,857
Nothing. You don't know a goddamn
thing about me, you know that?

333
00:25:25,198 --> 00:25:28,133
Always tomorro w

334
00:25:28,368 --> 00:25:30,233
Lean on me

335
00:25:30,437 --> 00:25:33,065
-Wh en you're not strong
-Excuse me.

336
00:25:33,273 --> 00:25:35,468
-I'll be your friend
-Excuse me.

337
00:25:35,708 --> 00:25:37,699
-I'll help you carry--
-Excuse me!

338
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:41,278
We're better together! No drugs!

339
00:25:41,481 --> 00:25:43,506
Grant me the serenity to...

340
00:25:43,716 --> 00:25:46,810
-...accept the things I cannot change--
-Excuse me!

341
00:27:38,431 --> 00:27:39,420
Are you coming?

342
00:27:40,233 --> 00:27:41,359
No.

343
00:27:46,272 --> 00:27:47,073
Hi, my name is Corn ell.

344
00:27:47,073 --> 00:27:47,801
Hi, my name is Corn ell.

345
00:27:47,907 --> 00:27:51,707
I am a drug addict, alcoholic,
compulsive gamblerlliar.

346
00:27:52,011 --> 00:27:54,309
Hi, Cornell.

347
00:27:55,181 --> 00:27:58,412
For those of you
who are new tonight...

348
00:27:58,618 --> 00:28:01,951
...l know that this is not your year.

349
00:28:38,224 --> 00:28:41,921
If that'll make you happy,
I will stop drinking.

350
00:28:43,229 --> 00:28:45,754
And then I would tell myself:

351
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,700
"Tonight I will not get wasted."

352
00:28:52,071 --> 00:28:54,096
And then something would happen.

353
00:28:55,174 --> 00:28:57,074
Or nothing would happen.

354
00:28:57,877 --> 00:29:01,142
And I'd get that feeling.

355
00:29:01,914 --> 00:29:04,405
And you all know
what that feeling is.

356
00:29:04,984 --> 00:29:06,952
Wh en yourskin is screaming...

357
00:29:07,153 --> 00:29:08,984
...and yourhands are shaking...

358
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:13,782
...and yourstomach feels like
it wants tojump...

359
00:29:14,494 --> 00:29:15,825
...thro ugh your throat.

360
00:29:16,729 --> 00:29:20,460
And you know that
ifanyone had a clue...

361
00:29:20,667 --> 00:29:22,760
...how wrong it felt to be sober. ..

362
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:26,234
...th ey wouldn't dream
ofasking you to stay that way.

363
00:29:26,572 --> 00:29:29,837
Th ey would say, "Oh,jeez,
I didn't know. Here.

364
00:29:30,743 --> 00:29:34,736
It's okay foryou.
Yo u do that mound of cocaine.

365
00:29:34,947 --> 00:29:37,381
Have a drink. Have 20 drinks.

366
00:29:37,583 --> 00:29:40,643
Whateveryou need to do to feel...

367
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,247
...like a normal human being...

368
00:29:43,623 --> 00:29:44,681
...you do it. "

369
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:47,255
And, boy, I did it.

370
00:29:47,593 --> 00:29:49,857
I drank, and I snorted...

371
00:29:50,096 --> 00:29:53,190
...and I drank and snorted
and drank and snorted.

372
00:29:53,766 --> 00:29:56,599
And I did this day after day
afternight afternight.

373
00:29:56,803 --> 00:29:59,169
I didn't care about th e consequences.

374
00:29:59,372 --> 00:30:04,309
Because I knew that th ey couldn't be
halfas bad as not using.

375
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,040
Oh, God!

376
00:30:09,282 --> 00:30:12,615
And then one night
something happened.

377
00:30:12,885 --> 00:30:14,785
You know you're screwed.

378
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:26,957
I woke up.

379
00:30:28,301 --> 00:30:30,826
I woke up on a sidewalk.

380
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:35,633
I had no idea where I was. I couldn't
have told you the city I was in.

381
00:30:36,142 --> 00:30:37,769
My head was pounding...

382
00:30:37,977 --> 00:30:41,071
...and I looked down
and my shirt is covered in blood.

383
00:30:42,014 --> 00:30:45,711
And as I'm lying th ere,
wondering what happens next. ..

384
00:30:47,186 --> 00:30:48,517
...l heard a voice.

385
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:50,086
And it said:

386
00:30:50,823 --> 00:30:54,190
"Man, this is not a way to live.

387
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:58,860
This is a way to die."

388
00:31:11,043 --> 00:31:12,237
Can I help you?

389
00:31:12,445 --> 00:31:14,140
Eddie Boone, checking in.

390
00:31:14,347 --> 00:31:17,077
You can't bring a girl
into treatment with you, Eddie.

391
00:31:18,284 --> 00:31:19,945
I wasn't gonna keep her.

392
00:31:20,286 --> 00:31:23,084
You were really lucky
you didn't break anything.

393
00:31:23,523 --> 00:31:26,014
It'll be tender and swollen
for a while.

394
00:31:26,225 --> 00:31:30,719
You'll have to live with the pain,
because I can't give you anything.

395
00:31:31,063 --> 00:31:32,428
So take these.

396
00:31:34,033 --> 00:31:35,364
That's good.

397
00:31:35,968 --> 00:31:39,631
Listen, rest.
Alternate heat and cold.

398
00:32:11,838 --> 00:32:14,033
You know, your carpet is filthy.

399
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,606
I only bring that up because...

400
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:20,472
...carpet grit's responsible
for a lot of major health problems.

401
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:24,013
That's the last thing
that you need around here.

402
00:32:28,254 --> 00:32:31,883
Listen, about that jail thing...

403
00:32:32,091 --> 00:32:35,527
...l can't. I can't go.

404
00:32:37,363 --> 00:32:40,230
Not because I don't
want to go, but....

405
00:32:42,935 --> 00:32:47,872
Oh, God, my hands. They just keep
doing that. That's not normal.

406
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:50,165
There's something
wrong with my hands.

407
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,875
Well, with me.

408
00:32:52,111 --> 00:32:57,708
Because what kind of person
just jumps out of a window, you know?

409
00:32:58,251 --> 00:33:00,685
Because she can't sit still, you know?

410
00:33:00,887 --> 00:33:04,254
And be alone, and, you know,
in a room without....

411
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:07,789
You know, a person should be able
to just be alone, right?

412
00:33:08,761 --> 00:33:12,527
You know, human beings should
be able to just breathe.

413
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:15,061
I can't breathe.

414
00:33:15,601 --> 00:33:17,592
And I feel that....

415
00:33:17,803 --> 00:33:20,738
I think, I know
that if I go to jail...

416
00:33:22,074 --> 00:33:25,805
...like this, you know, I'll die.

417
00:33:27,647 --> 00:33:29,308
I don't want to die.

418
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:38,114
I don't like what's happening here.

419
00:33:38,324 --> 00:33:41,122
Wait a minute, let's try to use
a feeling word.

420
00:33:41,627 --> 00:33:42,924
I'm pissed!

421
00:33:43,129 --> 00:33:44,721
Okay, pissed. Why?

422
00:33:45,131 --> 00:33:47,361
Because no way should she be here.

423
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:48,556
Tell her.

424
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:51,263
No way should you be here!

425
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:54,906
That's right. There's a rule.
No using. You broke it.

426
00:33:55,274 --> 00:33:57,139
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry, my ass.

427
00:33:57,510 --> 00:34:02,345
All you've done since you got here is
sit around while the rest of us work.

428
00:34:02,748 --> 00:34:05,308
You expect us to be glad
that they let you stay?

429
00:34:05,518 --> 00:34:06,815
I'm not expecting anything.

430
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:10,113
Gwen, just listening.
Everybody, feeling words.

431
00:34:10,323 --> 00:34:12,018
I don't think you are giving.

432
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:15,455
I don't feel that
you are giving person.

433
00:34:15,661 --> 00:34:16,491
I'm trying!

434
00:34:16,696 --> 00:34:20,029
I don't feel niceness coming from you.

435
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:21,790
Should I go to another group?

436
00:34:22,001 --> 00:34:25,198
Great idea. Spread
your negativity even further.

437
00:34:25,871 --> 00:34:27,498
You know, if you really try...

438
00:34:27,707 --> 00:34:31,768
...you could ruin the experience
for the entire patient population.

439
00:34:31,978 --> 00:34:33,172
I am having a bad day!

440
00:34:33,379 --> 00:34:36,371
I am having the worst damn day
of my whole damn life!

441
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,948
So if it is not too much
to ask of you people...

442
00:34:39,151 --> 00:34:41,813
...will you just back the fuck off?!

443
00:34:48,027 --> 00:34:50,154
Excellent work.
Really excellent work.

444
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:53,955
Good sharing, everybody.

445
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,547
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

446
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:51,915
I wanted to talk to you
about last night.

447
00:35:52,124 --> 00:35:55,924
I don't normally do that,
but you were great.

448
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:58,857
Oh, my Lord.
You gotta be kidding me.

449
00:35:59,665 --> 00:36:01,860
-What?
-Promise me we were safe.

450
00:36:02,068 --> 00:36:03,501
-We were what?
-Safe.

451
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:04,897
Safe?

452
00:36:05,771 --> 00:36:08,535
You're not one of them
paternity suit kind of gals--

453
00:36:08,741 --> 00:36:09,730
What are you talking about?

454
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,099
What are you talking about?

455
00:36:12,311 --> 00:36:14,745
I'm talking about last night.

456
00:36:17,583 --> 00:36:19,244
You don't remember last night?

457
00:36:19,585 --> 00:36:21,382
I got a little drunk on the plane.

458
00:36:22,822 --> 00:36:24,050
Of course you did.

459
00:36:24,423 --> 00:36:25,788
You know what?

460
00:36:25,991 --> 00:36:29,620
It was nothing.
Just don't worry about it.

461
00:36:29,829 --> 00:36:31,729
-We didn't...?
-Nope.

462
00:36:33,899 --> 00:36:35,366
Thank God, boy--

463
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:38,469
You know what?
That's more than enough, thank you.

464
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:41,999
Nothing personal,
I just made myself a promise:

465
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:44,971
No more ending up naked
with some girl I don't know.

466
00:36:45,377 --> 00:36:48,972
That's a noble goal, and I wish you
the very best of luck with it.

467
00:36:49,915 --> 00:36:54,614
Cirrhosis is the ninth leading cause
of death in the United States...

468
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:58,085
...and 45%%% of the time,
that is alcohol-induced.

469
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:00,485
Let's take a look at the first slide.

470
00:37:01,494 --> 00:37:03,860
This could be your liver right now.

471
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:05,859
Do you have plans for dinner?

472
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:10,501
This is not a test about you
and how you act in relationships.

473
00:37:11,137 --> 00:37:13,128
It's called Equine Therapy.

474
00:37:13,339 --> 00:37:15,933
Tennessee doesn't lie and manipulate.

475
00:37:16,142 --> 00:37:20,442
He'll just respond to how you feel.
And your job is to clean his hoof.

476
00:37:20,646 --> 00:37:21,840
This is how one gets sober?

477
00:37:22,047 --> 00:37:25,016
It's character-revealing.
The way we approach the horse...

478
00:37:25,217 --> 00:37:27,447
...is like the way
we approach the world.

479
00:37:28,053 --> 00:37:31,989
We gotta try to match our insides
with our outsides. Be real.

480
00:37:32,224 --> 00:37:36,058
So my therapist today is
a very large, smelly beast of burden.

481
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:38,821
We're totally in sync.

482
00:37:39,031 --> 00:37:41,124
Step in, you breathe.

483
00:37:42,201 --> 00:37:44,533
Couldn't stink more if he were dead.

484
00:37:44,737 --> 00:37:47,570
You reach down, pinch the tendon...

485
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:50,298
...trust yourself,
and let the horse do the rest.

486
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:53,378
Who's gonna be first? Gwen?

487
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:56,478
-Think you might need help?
-Nope, I'm fine.

488
00:37:57,883 --> 00:37:58,941
Let yourself go.

489
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:01,984
All right, Mr. Ed,
just pick up your stupid foot.

490
00:38:03,889 --> 00:38:05,220
Can't force it.

491
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:10,090
-Sure you don't need some help?
-No. I'm fine.

492
00:38:10,296 --> 00:38:13,060
All right, look, Cornell,
just give me a pill...

493
00:38:13,265 --> 00:38:16,928
...give me a shot, I don't know,
give me a lobotomy.

494
00:38:17,136 --> 00:38:20,731
Instant gratification has worked
so well for you in the past.

495
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:23,033
Just take it easy and keep it simple.

496
00:38:23,876 --> 00:38:26,276
I am so tired by the way
you people talk.

497
00:38:26,478 --> 00:38:29,038
"One day at a time." What is that?

498
00:38:29,248 --> 00:38:31,273
Two, three days at a time
is an option?

499
00:38:31,483 --> 00:38:34,111
I don't need the RomperRoom
bullshit. I need....

500
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,252
What are you doing?

501
00:38:35,454 --> 00:38:38,855
It's a therapeutic tool.
You leave me no choice.

502
00:38:42,127 --> 00:38:44,789
Betty, you gotta get me
a new roommate. He stinks.

503
00:38:44,997 --> 00:38:47,329
I don't know
if he's just eating beef...

504
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:49,933
...and secreting ketones
out of every pore--

505
00:38:50,135 --> 00:38:52,535
We're gonna come back to this.
I'm gonna be back.

506
00:38:52,738 --> 00:38:55,206
We're in each other's lives, okay?

507
00:38:55,407 --> 00:38:59,343
Gwen, did you get a sign?
"Confront me if I don't ask for help."

508
00:39:00,646 --> 00:39:02,739
What kind of help
you looking for exactly?

509
00:39:07,152 --> 00:39:10,588
Okay, Traci.
I want you to tell your mom:

510
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:15,790
"When you do drugs,
this is what happens." Okay?

511
00:39:17,496 --> 00:39:21,557
When you do drugs, you don't do
any fun stuff like you used to.

512
00:39:22,434 --> 00:39:24,902
Be specific, Traci. What was fun?

513
00:39:26,005 --> 00:39:29,133
Well, when you play games with us
and do puzzles.

514
00:39:29,375 --> 00:39:30,899
That was fun.

515
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:38,144
I have an idea.

516
00:39:45,457 --> 00:39:47,482
Tell your mom
about the drawing, Darnell.

517
00:39:47,693 --> 00:39:51,720
It's of me and Traci home
late at night, and Mom's not there.

518
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:55,264
Tell your mom how that makes you feel
when she's not there.

519
00:39:55,868 --> 00:39:56,960
Worried.

520
00:39:58,671 --> 00:39:59,831
Scared.

521
00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:01,165
Great.

522
00:40:01,373 --> 00:40:02,840
Man! Not again.

523
00:40:03,042 --> 00:40:03,872
I don't know.

524
00:40:04,076 --> 00:40:05,134
Mom, wake up.

525
00:40:05,344 --> 00:40:06,368
I don't know.

526
00:40:06,578 --> 00:40:07,567
Mom?

527
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:10,339
Hello, wake up!

528
00:40:10,549 --> 00:40:12,278
Sad, I guess.

529
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:14,949
Lonely.

530
00:40:16,355 --> 00:40:17,982
-Hello?
-No reactions.

531
00:40:20,059 --> 00:40:20,889
I have an idea.

532
00:40:24,997 --> 00:40:26,555
-She's fine.
-She's up.

533
00:40:27,366 --> 00:40:28,765
Bye.

534
00:40:30,669 --> 00:40:32,534
Hey, hey, what do you know?

535
00:40:33,172 --> 00:40:35,697
Pills and booze have got to go!

536
00:40:35,908 --> 00:40:38,570
Hey, hey, what do you say?

537
00:40:38,777 --> 00:40:42,406
Sober is the only way!

538
00:40:49,388 --> 00:40:50,821
Good night, Eddie.

539
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:58,596
Wait for me!

540
00:40:58,797 --> 00:41:00,128
-Beat you!
-Girls!

541
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:01,162
What?

542
00:41:01,367 --> 00:41:03,358
-Aunt Helen, why are you here?
-Where's Mom?

543
00:41:03,602 --> 00:41:07,402
I'm just gonna be straight with you.
Your mother has passed.

544
00:41:07,606 --> 00:41:10,131
Just slap her real hard
and she'll wake up.

545
00:41:12,711 --> 00:41:18,013
This'll only be fora while until we
figure out something more permanent.

546
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:24,046
-Hello?
-Hey, it's me. Gwen.

547
00:41:24,289 --> 00:41:27,690
Well, I know which "me" it is.
What is it?

548
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,757
Let me guess. Yo u need money.

549
00:41:29,995 --> 00:41:34,261
-I'm not giving you any more money.
-Lil, I don't need money.

550
00:41:34,466 --> 00:41:37,162
-It's different this time.
-I'm glad to hearit.

551
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:40,532
Whatever happened to our
fun-and-friendly sister rapport?

552
00:41:40,739 --> 00:41:42,604
I don't know. You tell me.

553
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:54,113
Look, they make you....
They're having a family week.

554
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:55,377
What?

555
00:41:55,821 --> 00:41:57,721
Family sessions.

556
00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:02,290
They work with us for a few days,
teach us how to talk to each other...

557
00:42:02,494 --> 00:42:04,928
...and then supervise
an actual conversation.

558
00:42:05,164 --> 00:42:06,893
You want me to come there?

559
00:42:07,766 --> 00:42:10,394
They make you ask somebody,
so it's either you or Aunt Helen.

560
00:42:10,602 --> 00:42:13,093
So let me get this straight.

561
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:17,739
You screw up, and then I'm supposed
to drop everything in my life?

562
00:42:17,943 --> 00:42:21,504
They can schedule it around
what's good for you. So....

563
00:42:27,953 --> 00:42:29,477
No, it's just--

564
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:35,424
I'm cooking here, okay?
I've got people coming over.

565
00:42:35,627 --> 00:42:37,026
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

566
00:42:37,229 --> 00:42:39,595
-I didn't mean....
-No, you never do.

567
00:42:40,132 --> 00:42:42,293
Gwen, you never mean anything.

568
00:42:45,637 --> 00:42:47,366
I have to go.

569
00:42:48,407 --> 00:42:51,399
Lil, look,
I bet this one's really fast.

570
00:42:52,344 --> 00:42:55,006
It's just a table, stupid.
Leave it alone.

571
00:42:55,214 --> 00:42:56,806
No. It's a sled.

572
00:43:05,224 --> 00:43:09,058
Well, I'm not a fan of
all soap operas. Just Santa Cruz.

573
00:43:09,328 --> 00:43:13,788
I mean, it's just an incredible show.
I saw it the first time...

574
00:43:14,766 --> 00:43:18,998
...when I was hospitalized a while ago
after I got out of my first rehab.

575
00:43:19,204 --> 00:43:21,468
There was this girl
on the show, Darian.

576
00:43:21,673 --> 00:43:25,871
She was also hospitalized, and it was
like I was staring at myself.

577
00:43:26,078 --> 00:43:29,514
I mean, not physically,
because I don't have the curly hair.

578
00:43:29,715 --> 00:43:31,774
This whole thing
had happened with her.

579
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:34,851
She had actually been impregnated
by her brother...

580
00:43:35,087 --> 00:43:39,922
...but she obviously didn't know
it was her brother at the time.

581
00:43:40,325 --> 00:43:43,658
And I don't have a brother.
But I have sisters.

582
00:43:43,862 --> 00:43:46,330
So it's really sort of...

583
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:48,967
...been an inspiration...

584
00:43:49,635 --> 00:43:51,330
...for me.

585
00:43:51,537 --> 00:43:54,870
And it's really sort of
helped me stay sober...

586
00:43:55,374 --> 00:43:56,932
...off and on.

587
00:43:59,111 --> 00:44:00,942
Mom, everything's okay.

588
00:44:04,116 --> 00:44:05,515
Hey, Andrea.

589
00:44:14,893 --> 00:44:16,053
Hey, Daniel.

590
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:20,291
Want to give me one of those?

591
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:22,193
Get your own.

592
00:44:22,734 --> 00:44:24,224
All right, then.

593
00:44:30,342 --> 00:44:33,243
Hey, Gary, can I bum a cig?

594
00:44:49,494 --> 00:44:52,054
There she is. Hello, darling.
How are you?

595
00:44:56,368 --> 00:44:59,166
-Christ!
-Oh, my God, what's that?

596
00:44:59,371 --> 00:45:00,201
Nothing.

597
00:45:00,405 --> 00:45:02,635
You poor thing!
What are they doing to you?

598
00:45:02,841 --> 00:45:05,435
-I fell.
-Is that part of the therapy?

599
00:45:05,677 --> 00:45:09,443
You poor baby.
I know, I'll get you home, darling.

600
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:12,482
-Everyone's asking after you.
-Like who?

601
00:45:12,684 --> 00:45:15,209
Like Mrs. Lefkowitz from downstairs.
Remember?

602
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:17,479
-The non-talker?
-Five years, not a peep.

603
00:45:17,689 --> 00:45:21,056
I'm crossing the lobby yesterday,
she looks at me and says:

604
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:25,026
"Thanks God you got rid of that girl.
She's nothing but bad news."

605
00:45:27,532 --> 00:45:29,727
-That's not funny.
-Of course it's funny.

606
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:33,200
Anonymous strangers thinking
I'm bad news, that's not funny.

607
00:45:33,405 --> 00:45:35,999
Everyone I've told has laughed
really hard.

608
00:45:36,208 --> 00:45:38,108
-That's great.
-You need cheering up.

609
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:39,777
-I'll take you away.
-What?

610
00:45:39,978 --> 00:45:42,572
Get away from these freaky people.

611
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:45,511
I don't want to leave--
Oh, God!

612
00:45:49,054 --> 00:45:50,715
Here, have some cheese.

613
00:45:52,724 --> 00:45:53,884
Have it on a roll.

614
00:45:54,092 --> 00:45:56,060
No bread.
I'm getting fat.

615
00:45:56,261 --> 00:45:58,855
-It's better with bread.
-I don't want bread.

616
00:45:59,431 --> 00:46:03,060
I'll have the bread.
Just break it open for me, will you?

617
00:46:03,268 --> 00:46:05,498
-What is your problem?
-Break open the bread.

618
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:11,965
This is a ring.

619
00:46:12,344 --> 00:46:13,402
Yep.

620
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:16,413
What, are you proposing?

621
00:46:16,615 --> 00:46:18,082
Yeah, I am.

622
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:20,649
At rehab.

623
00:46:20,852 --> 00:46:24,982
No. I'm proposing to you now.
You happen to be here.

624
00:46:25,424 --> 00:46:26,618
Yeah, but....

625
00:46:27,459 --> 00:46:30,223
I don't know. I mean....
"Well, how did he ask?"

626
00:46:30,429 --> 00:46:32,158
"He visited me in rehab and...."

627
00:46:32,364 --> 00:46:34,059
So it's not moonlight in Maui.

628
00:46:34,266 --> 00:46:36,393
Where would we get married?
McSorley's Pub?

629
00:46:36,601 --> 00:46:38,398
Why not? Make a good story.

630
00:46:38,603 --> 00:46:43,165
I don't need any more stories. I have
enough stories. I would like a life.

631
00:46:46,211 --> 00:46:47,769
That's what I was offering.

632
00:46:55,654 --> 00:46:57,849
-What is that?
-Champagne.

633
00:46:58,056 --> 00:47:01,116
I brought it thinking, wrongly,
this might be a romantic moment.

634
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:08,224
This is so not how I saw
this whole thing playing out!

635
00:47:08,433 --> 00:47:10,799
I'm not taking this
as lightly as I used to.

636
00:47:11,002 --> 00:47:12,060
-Taking what?
-This.

637
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:13,601
This.

638
00:47:14,072 --> 00:47:17,007
This straighten-up-and-fly-right thing.
This....

639
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:20,110
I don't know. Maybe there is
something wrong with me.

640
00:47:20,312 --> 00:47:21,609
-That's what they say?
-No!

641
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:24,580
It is. You know what?
I think they're right.

642
00:47:24,783 --> 00:47:28,583
They're not. You're just in a rut.
It happens to everyone.

643
00:47:28,787 --> 00:47:32,154
No, there's an entire world of people
who do everything right.

644
00:47:32,357 --> 00:47:35,258
They live right, they don't drink,
they don't do drugs.

645
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:36,825
-A crock of shit.
-They're happy.

646
00:47:37,028 --> 00:47:39,792
They're not happy.
No adult human being is happy.

647
00:47:39,998 --> 00:47:41,295
People are born.

648
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:44,560
They have a limited time to think
life is dandy, but then...

649
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:48,433
...inevitably, tragedy strikes
and they realize life equals loss.

650
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:52,542
The point of the game is to minimize
the pain caused by that equation.

651
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:57,181
Some people do it by having kids
or making money or coin collecting.

652
00:47:57,682 --> 00:47:59,809
And others do it by getting wasted.

653
00:48:00,485 --> 00:48:04,421
Letting that switch in the head turn
the hot light off and the cool light on.

654
00:48:04,656 --> 00:48:06,089
Nobody gets hurt collecting coins.

655
00:48:06,324 --> 00:48:09,725
Everybody hurts everybody.
It's the human condition!

656
00:48:10,061 --> 00:48:14,623
Don't let them tell you there's
something wrong with you! You're fine!

657
00:48:15,167 --> 00:48:16,361
I don't feel fine.

658
00:48:16,568 --> 00:48:21,505
Of course not. You're in Deliverance
country surrounded by sober freaks.

659
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:23,669
And you're not with me.

660
00:48:24,509 --> 00:48:28,468
I don't feel fine these days either,
and I think that's because we're apart.

661
00:48:28,747 --> 00:48:30,009
You're mine.

662
00:48:30,415 --> 00:48:31,677
I'm yours.

663
00:48:33,218 --> 00:48:34,685
I love you.

664
00:48:36,388 --> 00:48:39,789
Why do you want me, Jasper?
I am such a mess.

665
00:48:40,025 --> 00:48:41,720
Maybe I like mess.

666
00:48:43,094 --> 00:48:44,823
Th ere 's a time when you can share...

667
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:49,594
...and you can hold hands
and be on the same path.

668
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:55,873
But there's always
a fork in the road at some point.

669
00:48:57,442 --> 00:49:00,411
And sometimes you have to go
on one part of the fork...

670
00:49:00,612 --> 00:49:03,376
...and they gotta go
on the other part of the fork.

671
00:49:05,283 --> 00:49:09,720
Or just down the back part of the fork
while you go forward.

672
00:49:10,222 --> 00:49:11,712
And they're like....

673
00:49:13,959 --> 00:49:16,792
Or they got a salad fork
and you have a big dinner fork...

674
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:20,294
...and you have longer to go,
but they're done, because that's it.

675
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:23,627
They're stuck on a piece of food
that they....

676
00:49:24,669 --> 00:49:27,832
The dessert fork or, like,
one of those, you know...

677
00:49:28,073 --> 00:49:31,565
...small crab forks,
and you're trying to get out a crab.

678
00:49:31,776 --> 00:49:35,678
And you're over here jumping to
the huge serving fork...

679
00:49:35,914 --> 00:49:40,180
...or something like that.
Or a ladle, you know.

680
00:49:46,758 --> 00:49:48,282
Hey, And?

681
00:49:49,094 --> 00:49:50,527
Guess what.

682
00:49:54,432 --> 00:49:56,957
Goober. Are you not
talking to me right now?

683
00:49:57,202 --> 00:49:59,136
I only had, like, five pieces.

684
00:50:02,874 --> 00:50:03,863
What are you doing?

685
00:50:04,676 --> 00:50:06,667
Here, give me that.

686
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:08,345
-She didn't come.
-Your mom?

687
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:10,606
I waited all day for her.

688
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:12,617
I did my hair.

689
00:50:12,817 --> 00:50:15,581
She probably had to work
or something like that.

690
00:50:15,787 --> 00:50:18,585
No, she just hates me.
I make her embarrassed.

691
00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:20,758
She doesn't hate you.
I'll get someone.

692
00:50:20,959 --> 00:50:22,790
-Don't tell anybody!
-It's okay.

693
00:50:22,994 --> 00:50:24,689
We have to. It's very serious.

694
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:26,761
They'll take me to Psychiatric!

695
00:50:26,965 --> 00:50:29,627
Please, I can't get kicked out again.

696
00:50:30,535 --> 00:50:33,971
Okay, we're not gonna go anywhere,
all right?

697
00:50:34,773 --> 00:50:36,638
All right, come on.

698
00:50:36,875 --> 00:50:39,639
Why don't we go in the other room?

699
00:50:43,148 --> 00:50:46,083
-How did you do that?
-What? That?

700
00:50:46,651 --> 00:50:48,050
It's pretty easy.

701
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:51,711
You just take one of these.

702
00:50:56,328 --> 00:50:58,023
Tear it in half.

703
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:01,023
Just so you know, I wasn't...

704
00:51:01,933 --> 00:51:04,834
...trying to off myself or anything.

705
00:51:07,906 --> 00:51:10,534
It's just something I do sometimes.

706
00:51:12,043 --> 00:51:13,169
Doesn't it hurt?

707
00:51:14,179 --> 00:51:15,908
It feels better.

708
00:51:16,381 --> 00:51:17,609
Than what?

709
00:51:17,849 --> 00:51:19,146
Everything else.

710
00:51:27,258 --> 00:51:28,748
Like that.

711
00:51:29,594 --> 00:51:32,688
Then you try and slip them
into the cracks like that.

712
00:51:40,538 --> 00:51:41,800
Is he a drunk?

713
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:43,974
I don't know. Maybe.

714
00:51:44,376 --> 00:51:46,276
Then you'll have to say no.

715
00:51:49,047 --> 00:51:51,174
It's just like Darian and Falcon.

716
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:53,144
He was addicted to gambling...

717
00:51:53,351 --> 00:51:56,582
...and even though
she completely loved him...

718
00:51:56,855 --> 00:51:58,254
...she had to walk away.

719
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:00,355
Do I know these people?

720
00:52:01,026 --> 00:52:02,254
From Santa Cruz.

721
00:52:03,228 --> 00:52:05,253
It was more complicated for them.

722
00:52:05,463 --> 00:52:07,931
They were actually
half-brother, half-sister.

723
00:52:08,133 --> 00:52:11,591
But Darian didn't know that
when she found out about the gambling.

724
00:52:12,771 --> 00:52:15,171
Can't believe this is
the advice I'm getting.

725
00:52:15,907 --> 00:52:19,434
A show doesn't stay on the air
for 1 8 years for being stupid.

726
00:52:28,153 --> 00:52:31,418
Tonight's lecture:
"l've Worked All 12 Steps.

727
00:52:31,623 --> 00:52:33,614
Can I Go Home Now?"

728
00:52:40,965 --> 00:52:42,364
Bus is here.

729
00:52:42,667 --> 00:52:43,964
Thanks.

730
00:52:44,769 --> 00:52:46,361
Oh, my God.

731
00:52:47,772 --> 00:52:50,764
Let's go, team!
It's all about trust today.

732
00:53:00,452 --> 00:53:01,544
Come here.

733
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,651
Listen.

734
00:53:04,956 --> 00:53:08,448
About last night, I really think
you should tell somebody.

735
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:11,527
-Oh, yeah. I already did.
-Yeah, when?

736
00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:14,860
This morning. I found my counselor,
and I told her...

737
00:53:15,066 --> 00:53:17,159
...and we talked about it.
She'll help me.

738
00:53:17,335 --> 00:53:19,303
Hold on. You really talked to her?

739
00:53:19,504 --> 00:53:21,495
No, I'm making it up.

740
00:53:22,474 --> 00:53:25,170
We don't really have to climb
this thing, do we?

741
00:53:25,376 --> 00:53:28,038
We don't know the whole story.
We ought to hear her side...

742
00:53:28,246 --> 00:53:30,646
...before we go saying what's what.

743
00:53:31,149 --> 00:53:32,207
Guzzling Gwen!

744
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:35,079
-What's with the ring-in-the-roll guy?
-Who?

745
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:36,446
Your boyfriend!

746
00:53:36,654 --> 00:53:39,885
Andrea, does the phrase
"in confidence" mean anything?

747
00:53:40,091 --> 00:53:42,150
You never said not to tell.

748
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:46,296
I know better than anyone
how important it is who you marry.

749
00:53:46,498 --> 00:53:50,594
But just because somebody proposes,
that don't mean you have to say yes.

750
00:53:50,935 --> 00:53:53,426
-Did someone propose to Gwen?
-Her boyfriend.

751
00:53:53,671 --> 00:53:56,401
-I thought Gwen was a lesbian.
-I'm not a lesbian!

752
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:57,734
It's okay if you are.

753
00:53:57,942 --> 00:53:59,603
Can we talk about something else?

754
00:53:59,844 --> 00:54:00,970
When did this happen?

755
00:54:01,179 --> 00:54:03,113
Yesterday. On the lake.

756
00:54:03,348 --> 00:54:07,307
Was it sunset?
Sunset by the lake is very romantic.

757
00:54:07,519 --> 00:54:10,147
It was lunchtime,
and he brought a picnic...

758
00:54:10,355 --> 00:54:11,413
...with champagne.

759
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:13,022
He brought champagne?

760
00:54:13,224 --> 00:54:15,488
We didn't drink it.
I threw it overboard.

761
00:54:15,693 --> 00:54:18,594
It's not a very cool guy
to bring you booze in rehab.

762
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:21,322
He doesn't understand
what I'm doing here.

763
00:54:21,533 --> 00:54:24,627
If you're serious about getting sober,
your love partner would know.

764
00:54:24,869 --> 00:54:27,099
You must not be committed
to your recovery.

765
00:54:28,039 --> 00:54:29,165
-Oh, my God!
-Sorry.

766
00:54:29,374 --> 00:54:31,342
Shouldn't you be doing something now?

767
00:54:31,543 --> 00:54:34,068
-I got you.
-I say you dump that guy.

768
00:54:34,279 --> 00:54:38,443
I can make this decision on my own,
okay? I don't need your help.

769
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:40,015
That's not what your sign says.

770
00:54:40,218 --> 00:54:41,651
Forget what my sign says!

771
00:54:41,886 --> 00:54:44,616
He doesn't know a thing about me!
Neither do you all!

772
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:46,188
You don't live my shitty life.

773
00:54:46,391 --> 00:54:50,225
Until you do, do not tell me to give
up the one person that matters to me!

774
00:54:50,428 --> 00:54:54,626
I know he's not perfect, but he's the
one that'll show up on my birthday...

775
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:57,028
...and say, "l'm glad you were born!"

776
00:54:57,936 --> 00:54:59,335
What's the matter with you?

777
00:54:59,571 --> 00:55:01,471
-Just let go.
-Trust it.

778
00:55:02,974 --> 00:55:05,568
Oh, my God! Look at my package.

779
00:55:07,312 --> 00:55:10,179
No matter where I may roam

780
00:55:10,748 --> 00:55:14,149
On land orsea or foam

781
00:55:14,953 --> 00:55:18,582
Yo u can always hearme
Singing this song

782
00:55:18,790 --> 00:55:21,384
Show me th e way to go home

783
00:55:22,193 --> 00:55:23,626
Here we go.

784
00:55:26,331 --> 00:55:29,061
Is there a key to the ladies' room?
Thank you.

785
00:55:33,538 --> 00:55:34,527
Excuse me, sir.

786
00:55:35,673 --> 00:55:37,732
Can I have the key to the men's room?

787
00:55:41,079 --> 00:55:42,068
What?

788
00:55:43,214 --> 00:55:44,545
-What?
-Eddie Boone!

789
00:55:44,749 --> 00:55:45,977
Thank you.

790
00:55:48,186 --> 00:55:50,177
Come on, come on, come on.

791
00:55:52,257 --> 00:55:53,918
I need some paper, some pens.

792
00:55:54,158 --> 00:55:55,955
Dad, we need a napkin or something.

793
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,424
Okay, hold on. Let me look.

794
00:55:58,663 --> 00:56:01,325
-This is all I got. That's it.
-Thanks.

795
00:56:03,368 --> 00:56:05,063
-What's your name?
-I'm Adam.

796
00:56:05,270 --> 00:56:06,669
-And I'm Dan.
-Adam and Dan.

797
00:56:06,871 --> 00:56:09,863
You pitched a no-hitter against
the Braves on August 4th.

798
00:56:10,074 --> 00:56:12,235
Is that right? August 4th?

799
00:56:12,443 --> 00:56:15,241
Eddie, where's your car, man?
I bet it's really cool!

800
00:56:15,446 --> 00:56:16,344
My car?

801
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:22,413
Guys, we gotta get home.
Say goodbye now.

802
00:56:22,954 --> 00:56:23,943
Nice to meet you.

803
00:56:24,355 --> 00:56:26,186
Yeah. Nice to meet you.

804
00:56:34,098 --> 00:56:36,396
Have a great season, Eddie.

805
00:56:51,215 --> 00:56:52,876
Mail call.

806
00:56:59,457 --> 00:57:02,290
Charm Blossom,
this really isn't necessary.

807
00:57:02,493 --> 00:57:06,293
Lining up the mail like a bar graph
to show the fullness of our lives.

808
00:57:06,497 --> 00:57:08,158
I know my life is empty, okay?

809
00:57:08,399 --> 00:57:09,889
For you.

810
00:57:27,085 --> 00:57:29,747
-Watching game tapes?
-Yep.

811
00:57:31,456 --> 00:57:33,014
They're out of ginger snaps.

812
00:57:40,465 --> 00:57:42,763
Looks like your mail's
more fun than mine.

813
00:57:43,368 --> 00:57:44,665
Do you want them?

814
00:57:44,869 --> 00:57:46,359
-You don't want them?
-No.

815
00:57:46,771 --> 00:57:48,102
What'd you get?

816
00:57:50,274 --> 00:57:53,107
-My sister's coming to family sessions.
-That's good.

817
00:57:53,311 --> 00:57:57,042
No. I'd pay very good money
not to hear what she has to say.

818
00:58:00,952 --> 00:58:05,150
So what's wrong with your balls?
So to speak.

819
00:58:06,357 --> 00:58:08,655
So to speak, nothing.
I don't want them.

820
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,555
-Why not?
-Because I don't.

821
00:58:10,795 --> 00:58:14,026
That's a tautology. Something is
what it is because it is what it is.

822
00:58:14,232 --> 00:58:15,824
The sky is blue
because it reflects the ocean.

823
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:18,298
The ocean is blue
because it reflects the sky.

824
00:58:18,569 --> 00:58:20,036
Who are you talking to?

825
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:24,303
I have no idea.

826
00:58:27,145 --> 00:58:29,943
I bet you can't sit still
and be quiet for one minute.

827
00:58:30,148 --> 00:58:31,513
I can.

828
00:58:32,850 --> 00:58:35,216
Is this what we're doing now?

829
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:37,820
A little quiet contest?

830
00:58:47,999 --> 00:58:48,988
Wait a minute!

831
00:58:49,934 --> 00:58:51,731
-These are not game tapes.
-Wait!

832
00:58:52,437 --> 00:58:53,927
-Oh, my God!
-Let me have that!

833
00:58:54,172 --> 00:58:57,141
I know what this is!
I can't believe you watch this!

834
00:58:57,341 --> 00:59:00,401
-I wasn't!
-Santa Cruz watcher.

835
00:59:13,524 --> 00:59:14,650
-I'm sorry.
-It's fine.

836
00:59:14,859 --> 00:59:17,692
-No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
-No, it's totally fine.

837
00:59:21,199 --> 00:59:24,100
I always do that. I always do that.

838
00:59:24,535 --> 00:59:26,264
You always do what?

839
00:59:26,838 --> 00:59:28,237
Women....

840
00:59:29,373 --> 00:59:34,072
Drugs, women.
I mean, just leap before you think.

841
00:59:34,278 --> 00:59:35,609
Not you. I mean....

842
00:59:35,813 --> 00:59:38,247
What are you saying?
What? You were...

843
00:59:38,783 --> 00:59:40,375
...trying to snort me?

844
00:59:43,287 --> 00:59:44,652
Yeah, maybe.

845
00:59:46,090 --> 00:59:49,287
What a perfect opportunity
to thank him for curing your cancer.

846
00:59:49,927 --> 00:59:53,988
Ifl had known he was gonna save
yourlife just tojoin it with his...

847
00:59:54,232 --> 00:59:56,200
...l would've preferred you'd died.

848
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:00,734
Pretty good show once
you get to know everybody in it.

849
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:04,331
So who sent you all those balls?

850
01:00:07,178 --> 01:00:10,238
My agent. He's trying to psych me up.

851
01:00:10,448 --> 01:00:12,075
Oh, for next season?

852
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:15,651
Well, for there to be a next season.

853
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:17,851
Why? You thinking about retiring?

854
01:00:18,689 --> 01:00:22,625
I don't know. Might have to.
I mean, you gotta quit sometime.

855
01:00:23,294 --> 01:00:25,524
I'm not 22 anymore.

856
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:28,856
Plus, you know,
maybe a more normal life...

857
01:00:29,534 --> 01:00:32,025
...might be a little less pressure.

858
01:00:32,937 --> 01:00:36,771
I understand. Marry a cute girl,
move to the suburbs...

859
01:00:36,974 --> 01:00:40,068
...spend your weekends mowing.
You won't want to do coke again.

860
01:00:40,278 --> 01:00:42,508
-Are you okay?
-Th ese headaches!

861
01:00:46,517 --> 01:00:48,109
Darian? Darian?

862
01:00:48,486 --> 01:00:50,681
What th e hell is he doing here ?

863
01:00:53,324 --> 01:00:56,953
Get an ambulance.
He has meligioma astro cytroma.

864
01:00:57,528 --> 01:00:58,517
What is it?

865
01:01:00,865 --> 01:01:03,390
A tiny little cluster ofbrain tumors.

866
01:01:03,634 --> 01:01:04,965
"Tiny clusters"?

867
01:01:05,469 --> 01:01:06,458
He's very sick.

868
01:01:13,077 --> 01:01:16,103
Attention all patients.
Tonight's lecture:

869
01:01:16,314 --> 01:01:19,340
"What's Wrong With Celebrating
Sobriety By Getting Drunk?"

870
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:21,711
Give it to her.

871
01:01:23,154 --> 01:01:24,815
Just give it to her.

872
01:01:25,923 --> 01:01:27,652
My God! Where did you get this?

873
01:01:27,858 --> 01:01:30,656
Guys, this is the soap opera
that I watch.

874
01:01:31,329 --> 01:01:32,728
-You watch my soap?
-Yeah.

875
01:01:32,930 --> 01:01:35,626
Eddie, you surprise me.

876
01:01:35,833 --> 01:01:38,597
I only work every fifth day.
What else do I do with my time?

877
01:01:39,170 --> 01:01:41,035
Well, thank you very much.

878
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:45,232
Sometimes I like to read.
You know, literature? Stuff like that.

879
01:01:45,443 --> 01:01:48,173
Yo urbetting is what lostyou
yourmoney and my respect.

880
01:01:49,947 --> 01:01:51,437
I love you.

881
01:01:56,254 --> 01:01:59,690
Mom, Dr. Griffin,
what are you doing here ?

882
01:02:01,626 --> 01:02:04,789
We 've come to tell you
something about Falcon.

883
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:09,089
Darian, it looks like I may be
carrying Falcon's child.

884
01:02:09,867 --> 01:02:11,994
What do you want to bet
that child...

885
01:02:12,203 --> 01:02:14,194
...turns out to have
a gambling problem?

886
01:02:18,209 --> 01:02:20,439
It's just anoth er tiny cluster.

887
01:02:20,645 --> 01:02:21,771
Do something!

888
01:02:22,713 --> 01:02:24,408
It'll be overin a minute.

889
01:02:25,383 --> 01:02:28,045
He'll get over it.
Falcon will be back, better than ever.

890
01:02:28,252 --> 01:02:29,742
No, Falcon's leaving the show.

891
01:02:29,954 --> 01:02:31,717
He's having brain clusters.

892
01:02:31,956 --> 01:02:33,548
Mayb e it's more than a tiny cluster.

893
01:02:34,225 --> 01:02:35,954
I hate that mother.

894
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,184
I love her.

895
01:02:37,395 --> 01:02:39,556
-You do?
-I think she's hilarious.

896
01:02:40,731 --> 01:02:43,495
I want you to talk to Gwen,
and be specific.

897
01:02:44,268 --> 01:02:46,327
Pick one incident.

898
01:02:48,172 --> 01:02:50,732
You ruined my wedding.

899
01:02:51,075 --> 01:02:53,373
And when that happened,
how did you feel?

900
01:02:53,577 --> 01:02:55,772
How do you think it made me feel?

901
01:02:56,981 --> 01:02:58,312
Tell her.

902
01:02:59,417 --> 01:03:03,854
I'm trying to explain here, okay?
I mean, you asked me, so I'm just....

903
01:03:04,822 --> 01:03:07,689
I mean, she shows up drunk...

904
01:03:08,793 --> 01:03:11,353
...stumbles through
the entire ceremony.

905
01:03:11,595 --> 01:03:13,358
At the reception, she gets up...

906
01:03:14,265 --> 01:03:16,893
...and, in front of my friends...

907
01:03:17,101 --> 01:03:20,161
...my new in-laws,
she gives this toast...

908
01:03:20,371 --> 01:03:23,534
-...that was completely--
-What? What toast?

909
01:03:23,774 --> 01:03:26,208
-Gwen, let your sister talk.
-What toast?

910
01:03:27,211 --> 01:03:31,944
"Well, not everybody can be perfect.
But at least some of us can try."

911
01:03:34,485 --> 01:03:38,922
We all know that grownups
have to make compromises.

912
01:03:39,123 --> 01:03:43,116
And Lily is very, very grown up.

913
01:03:43,794 --> 01:03:46,160
So that's what she did.

914
01:03:46,464 --> 01:03:47,954
She said:

915
01:03:48,466 --> 01:03:50,297
"ls Andrew...

916
01:03:50,634 --> 01:03:54,593
...the very best man for me...

917
01:03:54,805 --> 01:03:56,602
...on this earth?

918
01:03:57,942 --> 01:04:01,776
No. And I mean, no."

919
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:05,747
She says, "Hey, I'm not
getting any younger.

920
01:04:05,950 --> 01:04:08,282
He makes a hell of a lot of money.

921
01:04:08,486 --> 01:04:10,511
So I'll marry the little sucker."

922
01:04:11,789 --> 01:04:15,555
To Lily and her little sucker.

923
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:17,321
That's not what happened.

924
01:04:17,528 --> 01:04:22,397
You think that your memory of that day
is somehow better than mine?

925
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:25,125
-I don't think so.
-Stick with the format.

926
01:04:25,369 --> 01:04:29,829
I'm sticking to the format. I'm just
trying to give you a picture here.

927
01:04:30,141 --> 01:04:32,109
And she walks around...

928
01:04:32,309 --> 01:04:34,869
...like some victim...

929
01:04:35,079 --> 01:04:39,277
...like life just handed her
this raw deal.

930
01:04:39,483 --> 01:04:41,644
Well, you know, my father left too.

931
01:04:41,852 --> 01:04:44,412
And my mother died
when I was little too.

932
01:04:44,955 --> 01:04:46,923
And you don't see me using that...

933
01:04:47,124 --> 01:04:50,924
...as some excuse to just completely
abandon all self-control...

934
01:04:51,128 --> 01:04:52,595
...and indulge myself--

935
01:04:52,797 --> 01:04:55,265
Indulge? What?
You think I like this?

936
01:04:55,466 --> 01:04:57,957
We've gotten off-track here. Lily.

937
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:01,905
Think about Gwen's behavior
at your wedding...

938
01:05:02,106 --> 01:05:03,903
...and tell her now how you feel.

939
01:05:04,108 --> 01:05:07,043
Yeah, Lily, how does it make you feel?

940
01:05:11,148 --> 01:05:13,742
You know, this is just....

941
01:05:15,619 --> 01:05:17,484
I don't need this.

942
01:05:18,556 --> 01:05:20,319
I have a life.

943
01:05:25,129 --> 01:05:26,790
Lily, wait for me.

944
01:05:28,065 --> 01:05:29,054
Beat you.

945
01:05:56,627 --> 01:05:57,753
What are you doing?

946
01:06:10,274 --> 01:06:12,742
Great. Another thing I suck at.

947
01:06:13,010 --> 01:06:14,875
Well, hold on. Gwen, hey.

948
01:06:15,112 --> 01:06:16,374
Please.

949
01:06:17,114 --> 01:06:18,547
Come here a second.

950
01:06:19,550 --> 01:06:21,814
-What?
-What were you thinking about?

951
01:06:22,453 --> 01:06:25,149
When you threw the ball,
what were you thinking about?

952
01:06:27,625 --> 01:06:31,254
I don't know. The mating habits
of African ants. I don't know.

953
01:06:31,462 --> 01:06:32,588
The striped thing.

954
01:06:32,796 --> 01:06:34,889
You were thinking about
hitting the mattress.

955
01:06:35,132 --> 01:06:38,761
Well, you know, it might sound funny
to you, but that's all wrong.

956
01:06:38,969 --> 01:06:40,960
When you lock in on the strike zone...

957
01:06:41,171 --> 01:06:43,435
...it's looking about
the size of a peanut.

958
01:06:43,641 --> 01:06:47,270
And you think, "Damn. I gotta get
that little ball in there?"

959
01:06:47,478 --> 01:06:49,878
You've psyched yourself
right out of the game.

960
01:06:51,215 --> 01:06:53,274
The strike zone, the call...

961
01:06:53,484 --> 01:06:55,748
...the count, the batter,
forget all that.

962
01:06:56,086 --> 01:07:00,386
You gotta think about the little
things. The things you can control.

963
01:07:00,591 --> 01:07:04,186
You can control your stance,
your balance...

964
01:07:04,395 --> 01:07:07,091
...your release, your follow-through.

965
01:07:08,399 --> 01:07:11,835
Think about those little things
and only those little things....

966
01:07:16,006 --> 01:07:17,598
You know? I mean....

967
01:07:17,908 --> 01:07:21,071
Because when you let go of the ball...

968
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:23,012
...it's over.

969
01:07:23,681 --> 01:07:27,082
You don't have a say in what happens.
That's somebody else's job.

970
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:31,610
-I want you to try this.
-I don't want to.

971
01:07:31,822 --> 01:07:32,652
I'm just curious.

972
01:07:32,856 --> 01:07:36,155
-I don't want to do it.
-I just want to see how you hold it.

973
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:39,693
Don't grab it, don't grab it.
Look at it, look at it.

974
01:07:39,897 --> 01:07:41,694
Hold it like an egg.

975
01:07:42,199 --> 01:07:44,531
Loose. Easy. All right?

976
01:07:44,735 --> 01:07:47,101
Let me get a look at it
from over there.

977
01:07:48,372 --> 01:07:50,704
Let me get a look at it
from over there.

978
01:07:51,208 --> 01:07:52,197
All right.

979
01:07:53,410 --> 01:07:56,072
I want you to throw it over here
nice and easy.

980
01:07:57,247 --> 01:07:59,215
Point at me with your left hand.

981
01:07:59,550 --> 01:08:01,313
Throw it where you're pointing at.

982
01:08:04,021 --> 01:08:05,921
Better. But you nutted the batter...

983
01:08:06,123 --> 01:08:08,887
...and the other team's beating
the crap out of you.

984
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:12,629
Try again. Heads up.
I want you to do it again.

985
01:08:12,830 --> 01:08:14,991
This time, shut your eyes.

986
01:08:15,499 --> 01:08:17,057
-What?
-Just shut your eyes.

987
01:08:17,668 --> 01:08:19,158
-So weird.
-Fire away.

988
01:08:21,105 --> 01:08:23,835
Right there.
That is a strike in any country.

989
01:08:24,808 --> 01:08:26,070
You're a natural.

990
01:08:45,295 --> 01:08:46,387
Come on.

991
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:58,705
Folks, the definition of insanity...

992
01:08:58,942 --> 01:09:03,436
...is repeating the same behavior over
and over, expecting different results.

993
01:09:03,747 --> 01:09:04,975
Thank you.

994
01:09:07,618 --> 01:09:09,176
I have a question.

995
01:09:09,953 --> 01:09:14,481
Once we all leave, we have needs
that are going to need to be filled...

996
01:09:14,692 --> 01:09:18,651
...by people, physically, at times.

997
01:09:18,862 --> 01:09:22,525
How and when can we do that?
Not how, just when?

998
01:09:22,733 --> 01:09:24,291
Yeah, I know, I know.

999
01:09:24,635 --> 01:09:29,572
People in recovery want to know
when's a good time to start dating.

1000
01:09:30,641 --> 01:09:35,010
And my rule of thumb is, when you
get home, get yourself a plant.

1001
01:09:35,212 --> 01:09:37,874
I like spider plants,
but whatever turns you on.

1002
01:09:38,515 --> 01:09:41,916
Then, in about a year, get a pet.
And then, if, in say...

1003
01:09:42,152 --> 01:09:47,146
...two years, the plant
and the pet are still alive...

1004
01:09:47,691 --> 01:09:50,888
...then you can start to think about
having a relationship.

1005
01:09:51,095 --> 01:09:52,528
Thanks.

1006
01:09:53,831 --> 01:09:55,890
I'll be fine. I know what to do.

1007
01:09:56,100 --> 01:10:00,594
Don't drink, go to meetings,
find a sponsor, ask for help.

1008
01:10:01,405 --> 01:10:05,671
Don't drink, go to meetings,
find a sponsor, ask for help.

1009
01:10:05,876 --> 01:10:08,538
Happy trails to you

1010
01:10:08,746 --> 01:10:11,840
Keep smiling until th en

1011
01:10:12,049 --> 01:10:14,074
Wh o cares about th e clouds

1012
01:10:14,284 --> 01:10:15,945
If we're togeth er

1013
01:10:16,186 --> 01:10:19,678
Just sing a song
And bring th e sunny. ...

1014
01:10:20,858 --> 01:10:22,485
Well, I hope he makes it.

1015
01:10:22,693 --> 01:10:25,355
Statistically,
only three out of 1 0 of us will.

1016
01:10:25,562 --> 01:10:27,189
So in a way...

1017
01:10:27,397 --> 01:10:31,231
...it's good for us if he goes back
to using. You know?

1018
01:10:31,869 --> 01:10:33,393
Odds-wise.

1019
01:10:41,278 --> 01:10:43,906
God, I love afternoons like this.

1020
01:10:45,215 --> 01:10:47,046
Do you know what's missing?

1021
01:10:47,451 --> 01:10:51,444
That I don't have a dry vodka martini
with two olives in a chilled glass.

1022
01:10:52,055 --> 01:10:53,647
God, I miss that.

1023
01:10:53,891 --> 01:10:56,382
Lately I've been
lying awake at night...

1024
01:10:56,593 --> 01:11:00,188
...thinking of the dumb-ass things
I've done when I was messed up.

1025
01:11:00,397 --> 01:11:04,697
One night last year, at dinner,
I threw up all over my glazed ham.

1026
01:11:04,902 --> 01:11:07,268
Then I thought,
"Well, maybe nobody noticed."

1027
01:11:07,471 --> 01:11:10,133
I don't think of it as a garnish.

1028
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:11,329
I'm a winner.

1029
01:11:12,576 --> 01:11:13,474
Oh, God.

1030
01:11:13,777 --> 01:11:15,972
You know what the worst one was?
For me?

1031
01:11:16,814 --> 01:11:19,078
My best friend in the whole world.

1032
01:11:19,750 --> 01:11:23,481
We grew up playing ball,
hunting and fishing.

1033
01:11:23,921 --> 01:11:27,823
One Sunday morning, he walks in
on me and his wife in bed.

1034
01:11:29,793 --> 01:11:31,784
You never live that one down.

1035
01:11:34,331 --> 01:11:35,320
Tell me one of yours.

1036
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:38,158
Excuse me?

1037
01:11:38,368 --> 01:11:41,030
What's the worst thing you did
when you were messed up?

1038
01:11:41,872 --> 01:11:43,464
I don't know.

1039
01:11:44,541 --> 01:11:47,339
Come on. Give me a couple.
I'll pick one.

1040
01:11:47,544 --> 01:11:49,444
I don't really remember any.

1041
01:11:49,646 --> 01:11:51,739
I just told you some stuff that's....

1042
01:11:51,949 --> 01:11:54,918
I'm a drunk.
Drunks forget everything. You know?

1043
01:11:55,118 --> 01:11:56,278
Come on.

1044
01:11:56,486 --> 01:12:00,855
Why? So I can recount the last 1 5
disgusting years to humiliate myself?

1045
01:12:01,058 --> 01:12:02,582
-No, thanks.
-Why not?

1046
01:12:02,793 --> 01:12:05,694
Because I don't feel like
talking about it.

1047
01:12:05,896 --> 01:12:06,920
You too good for me?

1048
01:12:07,130 --> 01:12:09,621
Are you dense?
Did your mom drop you on your head?

1049
01:12:09,833 --> 01:12:13,030
I said no. I don't want to
talk about it. Just drop it.

1050
01:12:29,152 --> 01:12:31,313
God, it's so hard.

1051
01:12:31,822 --> 01:12:35,155
Yo u're a doctor.
That's th e way it's supposed to be.

1052
01:12:35,392 --> 01:12:38,225
We carry our own bags here.
This isn't the Sheraton.

1053
01:12:38,428 --> 01:12:41,454
Your chores are posted.
We will take the stairs.

1054
01:12:41,665 --> 01:12:45,829
What? I paid you a shitload of money.
I am not doing any chores.

1055
01:12:46,904 --> 01:12:48,201
-Pills.
-Booze.

1056
01:12:48,405 --> 01:12:49,394
Coke and sex.

1057
01:12:52,709 --> 01:12:54,802
It's your daughter, Darian, Deirdre.

1058
01:12:55,012 --> 01:12:59,005
Don't worry about Darian.
I tucked herinto bed hours ago.

1059
01:13:00,183 --> 01:13:02,014
So did l.

1060
01:13:03,353 --> 01:13:04,342
No.

1061
01:13:11,695 --> 01:13:13,356
Oh, God!

1062
01:13:13,730 --> 01:13:16,096
It was an unbelievable episode.
I wish you'd seen it.

1063
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:18,530
Everyone was losing their minds.

1064
01:13:20,237 --> 01:13:21,329
What are you doing?

1065
01:13:21,538 --> 01:13:22,869
Packing.

1066
01:13:23,974 --> 01:13:25,532
What does it look like?

1067
01:13:25,876 --> 01:13:28,572
-You're not leaving for a couple days.
-So?

1068
01:13:28,779 --> 01:13:31,577
I am leaving.
Might as well get ready.

1069
01:13:31,782 --> 01:13:34,478
There's no point in
making this room all homey...

1070
01:13:34,685 --> 01:13:36,619
...for only, like, 42 more hours.

1071
01:13:37,220 --> 01:13:40,553
There's 20 minutes left till curfew.
Let's get ice cream.

1072
01:13:40,891 --> 01:13:43,382
-Satisfy your sugar cravings.
-No, thanks.

1073
01:13:50,233 --> 01:13:52,030
You don't have to do this.

1074
01:13:52,235 --> 01:13:53,224
Do what?

1075
01:13:57,641 --> 01:14:00,371
How do you know what I have to do?
Have you ever left rehab?

1076
01:14:00,577 --> 01:14:01,566
No, but l--

1077
01:14:01,778 --> 01:14:05,179
You've never left rehab, so you
don't know what you're talking about.

1078
01:14:05,415 --> 01:14:08,851
True, but I have been a part
of some very emotional sing-outs--

1079
01:14:09,086 --> 01:14:11,714
I'm sorry. That's right.
You sang "Lean On Me" a few times.

1080
01:14:11,922 --> 01:14:13,981
The stupidest cheesy song ever.

1081
01:14:14,191 --> 01:14:16,921
You must know about leaving rehab
better than anyone.

1082
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:37,342
I got an eyelash. Make a wish.

1083
01:14:37,547 --> 01:14:39,538
Custody of my kids.

1084
01:14:41,218 --> 01:14:42,207
Sobriety.

1085
01:14:42,619 --> 01:14:45,053
Come on, baby. We all want that.

1086
01:14:45,255 --> 01:14:47,553
Think of something else.

1087
01:14:48,592 --> 01:14:50,651
My foreskin back.

1088
01:14:51,728 --> 01:14:54,094
No one asked me before they took it.

1089
01:14:54,831 --> 01:14:56,196
They just took it.

1090
01:14:57,601 --> 01:15:00,297
Way to share, Gerhardt.
Way to share.

1091
01:15:02,272 --> 01:15:03,899
Okay, here we go.

1092
01:15:08,512 --> 01:15:09,843
All gone.

1093
01:15:47,150 --> 01:15:48,139
Read the sign.

1094
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:50,546
Betty, where's the love?

1095
01:15:54,157 --> 01:15:55,488
Daniel, wow.

1096
01:15:55,826 --> 01:15:57,555
Guzzling Gwen.

1097
01:15:59,196 --> 01:16:00,458
What happened?

1098
01:16:00,664 --> 01:16:03,155
This? I honest to God don't know.

1099
01:16:04,668 --> 01:16:08,001
Well, it's really nice to see you.

1100
01:16:08,438 --> 01:16:09,427
Get a room.

1101
01:16:10,474 --> 01:16:12,135
Oh, my God, it's a joke!

1102
01:16:12,342 --> 01:16:14,936
It's a miracle! Oh, you know what?

1103
01:16:15,145 --> 01:16:17,909
I could use your medical expertise,
if you got a second.

1104
01:16:18,115 --> 01:16:19,605
I got a second.

1105
01:16:21,118 --> 01:16:24,610
-Use a condom.
-Ah, two! Two in one day!

1106
01:16:29,559 --> 01:16:30,753
Gerhardt?

1107
01:16:33,763 --> 01:16:37,563
I wrote this for Andrea's going away,
and that is for you.

1108
01:16:37,868 --> 01:16:39,392
-Am I the lead?
-Yes.

1109
01:16:39,603 --> 01:16:42,071
If you could do that,
that would be great.

1110
01:16:42,272 --> 01:16:43,671
I should direct this.

1111
01:16:43,874 --> 01:16:46,138
-You don't want me.
-You'll be great.

1112
01:16:46,343 --> 01:16:47,537
Gwen, I'll ruin it.

1113
01:16:47,744 --> 01:16:49,439
You get to wear lipstick.

1114
01:16:49,646 --> 01:16:50,635
Really?

1115
01:16:50,847 --> 01:16:54,146
So just think Meryl Streep.

1116
01:16:54,351 --> 01:16:56,649
Think Cry in th e Dark. Remember?

1117
01:16:56,853 --> 01:16:59,321
"Dingo stole my baby.
A dingo stole my baby."

1118
01:16:59,523 --> 01:17:03,186
Andrea D., mail pickup
at the Parker cabin, main room.

1119
01:17:03,393 --> 01:17:05,054
Okay, go. Go, go.

1120
01:17:11,401 --> 01:17:13,961
-Gerhardt, come on!
-All right. Okay.

1121
01:17:19,376 --> 01:17:20,843
Watch the phone.

1122
01:17:23,046 --> 01:17:25,071
Somebody sent you
a cute little monkey.

1123
01:17:25,282 --> 01:17:28,251
We used to make those here.
They're real easy.

1124
01:17:28,451 --> 01:17:30,783
You take a string,
tie it around the toes.

1125
01:17:31,521 --> 01:17:32,715
Becomes the head.

1126
01:17:33,390 --> 01:17:34,789
And arms--

1127
01:17:35,192 --> 01:17:36,181
Come here.

1128
01:17:38,962 --> 01:17:40,020
Sit down.

1129
01:17:43,967 --> 01:17:46,299
Hello, everybody. My name's Gwen.

1130
01:17:48,371 --> 01:17:52,307
I'm an alcoholic and an addict.
But I guess you already know that.

1131
01:17:53,376 --> 01:17:55,105
In honor of Andrea's departure...

1132
01:17:55,545 --> 01:17:57,706
...instead of singing
"Lean On Me" yet again...

1133
01:17:59,015 --> 01:18:02,109
...we have our own version
of Santa Cruz.

1134
01:18:04,254 --> 01:18:05,881
I hope you like it.

1135
01:18:07,123 --> 01:18:08,647
And now...

1136
01:18:08,858 --> 01:18:11,725
...Santa Booze.

1137
01:18:24,741 --> 01:18:26,971
Oh, Falcon. I am so afraid.

1138
01:18:27,177 --> 01:18:29,407
When they find I've taken you
out of the hospital...

1139
01:18:29,613 --> 01:18:32,548
...Mother and Dr. Griffin Hartley
are sure to come here.

1140
01:18:32,749 --> 01:18:34,478
What will we do?

1141
01:18:34,818 --> 01:18:36,979
If I can't be without--

1142
01:18:37,187 --> 01:18:38,119
With you.

1143
01:18:38,321 --> 01:18:42,917
If I can't be with you,
I would rather be dead.

1144
01:18:45,495 --> 01:18:48,931
But, dear God, the tiny clusters
of tumors in my brain.

1145
01:18:49,132 --> 01:18:52,465
Oh, God, the tiny little clusters
of tumors in his brain!

1146
01:18:52,669 --> 01:18:54,398
Somebody, help! Oh, God!

1147
01:18:54,604 --> 01:18:55,593
Wait...

1148
01:18:55,805 --> 01:18:57,932
...l have some pills that....

1149
01:18:59,342 --> 01:19:01,469
I'm okay. It's okay. I'm okay.

1150
01:19:01,678 --> 01:19:03,111
Oh, Falcon...

1151
01:19:03,313 --> 01:19:04,610
...hold me.

1152
01:19:08,385 --> 01:19:10,683
I knew we'd find you two together.

1153
01:19:12,222 --> 01:19:13,951
Darian, your lover...

1154
01:19:14,357 --> 01:19:17,258
...is also your sister!

1155
01:19:17,961 --> 01:19:19,121
No!

1156
01:19:19,329 --> 01:19:20,296
It's not possible.

1157
01:19:20,497 --> 01:19:21,794
It is not possible.

1158
01:19:23,366 --> 01:19:25,334
Deirdre, darling,
I have some bad news.

1159
01:19:25,535 --> 01:19:30,268
Your daughter, Darian,
Falcon's lover and sister...

1160
01:19:30,473 --> 01:19:32,373
...is also carrying my baby.

1161
01:19:32,575 --> 01:19:34,065
-No!
-No!

1162
01:19:34,277 --> 01:19:35,244
Oh, God!

1163
01:19:36,413 --> 01:19:38,404
Get out of here! Get out of here!

1164
01:19:38,948 --> 01:19:42,315
All right. I got no problem
getting out of here. I'll do this.

1165
01:19:43,486 --> 01:19:46,080
-What are you doing?
-Improvising. They do that on soaps.

1166
01:19:47,757 --> 01:19:49,520
What are you doing?

1167
01:19:49,726 --> 01:19:51,489
Just improvising. Go with it.

1168
01:19:51,728 --> 01:19:54,891
-Oh! But, no, my tumors!
-It's the melio....

1169
01:19:55,699 --> 01:19:58,395
Melagioma nestrocytroma.

1170
01:19:59,169 --> 01:20:01,865
Whatever. I'm sorry.
There's nothing I can do.

1171
01:20:02,872 --> 01:20:04,203
What are you doing?

1172
01:20:04,407 --> 01:20:06,602
It says in the script that we kiss.

1173
01:20:09,879 --> 01:20:12,780
I like you, bon voyage,
but I'm not kissing Gerhardt.

1174
01:20:13,450 --> 01:20:14,439
Okay, everybody.

1175
01:20:14,651 --> 01:20:18,417
Excellent work. That was really
good sharing. I really enjoyed that.

1176
01:20:18,621 --> 01:20:21,419
Good use of feeling words
and all that. Give me more.

1177
01:20:21,725 --> 01:20:22,714
Who are you?

1178
01:20:22,926 --> 01:20:24,860
Evelyn. Don't you recognize the hat?

1179
01:20:25,061 --> 01:20:27,894
Okay, but seeing as
you're all addicts...

1180
01:20:28,098 --> 01:20:32,262
...drugs, sex, the same story line
for 1 6 years...

1181
01:20:32,535 --> 01:20:36,130
...here are some therapeutic tools
to keep you going.

1182
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:41,633
Sometimes you gotta kiss ass
before you can kick it.

1183
01:20:41,845 --> 01:20:45,406
It's the engine that kills you,
not the caboose.

1184
01:20:45,615 --> 01:20:48,607
Make love, not war.

1185
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:53,920
Don't ever be someone's slogan,
because you are poetry.

1186
01:20:56,693 --> 01:20:57,990
Thank you.

1187
01:20:58,728 --> 01:21:00,127
You're welcome.

1188
01:21:04,801 --> 01:21:09,135
You missed a damn fine show. All your
favorite characters were there.

1189
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:11,935
Yeah, well, I'm happy for you.

1190
01:21:17,914 --> 01:21:19,643
You can't still be mad at me.

1191
01:21:20,984 --> 01:21:24,920
Listen, I'm sorry I said that.
You're not dense.

1192
01:21:25,588 --> 01:21:27,579
You're great. And....

1193
01:21:27,924 --> 01:21:30,484
That's why I didn't want to rehash...

1194
01:21:30,693 --> 01:21:34,459
...my entire disgusting history
in front of you, because....

1195
01:21:43,273 --> 01:21:45,605
And what you'll think. You'll just--

1196
01:21:47,877 --> 01:21:51,643
I know people's perceptions of girls
who screw other girls' boyfriends.

1197
01:21:51,848 --> 01:21:56,012
I know what the world's perception is
on somebody who goes into a bar...

1198
01:21:56,219 --> 01:21:59,916
...and realizes hours later I've left
my 3-year-old godson in the car.

1199
01:22:00,123 --> 01:22:03,115
People don't like people like that.
I don't like people like that.

1200
01:22:03,326 --> 01:22:06,955
Those are just things you've done.
Not who you are.

1201
01:22:07,464 --> 01:22:09,523
People make mistakes, you know?

1202
01:22:10,467 --> 01:22:12,059
Who you are is just fine.

1203
01:22:12,836 --> 01:22:14,030
More than fine.

1204
01:22:23,146 --> 01:22:25,376
Jasper. What are you doing here?

1205
01:22:25,582 --> 01:22:28,676
I was looking for you.
Successfully, as it turns out.

1206
01:22:28,885 --> 01:22:31,376
I meant, why aren't you
at your parents' house?

1207
01:22:31,588 --> 01:22:34,386
I realized, what with them
being completely senile...

1208
01:22:34,591 --> 01:22:37,992
...l could thank them for a great time,
they'll think I made the trip.

1209
01:22:38,194 --> 01:22:40,594
See, I thought you might be lonely.

1210
01:22:40,830 --> 01:22:41,854
This is Eddie.

1211
01:22:42,198 --> 01:22:43,893
He's a patient here.

1212
01:22:44,767 --> 01:22:46,291
And he's from Oklahoma.

1213
01:22:46,503 --> 01:22:48,835
How do you do, Eddie from Oklahoma?
I'm Jasper.

1214
01:22:50,607 --> 01:22:53,235
I'll leave you guys to it, then.

1215
01:22:53,443 --> 01:22:55,206
Hang on, I don't know about that.

1216
01:22:55,411 --> 01:22:59,177
You see, the way I see it, Gwennie,
we've got two options here.

1217
01:22:59,382 --> 01:23:02,044
Scenario 1 : We let Eddie
head off to the showers...

1218
01:23:02,252 --> 01:23:06,279
...wash off that manly sweat, and we
could bullshit our way through the day.

1219
01:23:06,489 --> 01:23:07,615
Or scenario 2:

1220
01:23:07,857 --> 01:23:10,758
We could acknowledge
the awkward situation we're in.

1221
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:12,791
I don't know what you mean.

1222
01:23:12,996 --> 01:23:16,727
That's a clear vote for scenario 1 .
How about you, Eddie from Oklahoma?

1223
01:23:16,966 --> 01:23:18,729
Care to weigh in?

1224
01:23:18,935 --> 01:23:20,800
Abstaining? lnteresting.

1225
01:23:21,037 --> 01:23:24,165
That leaves only me in favor
of calling a spade a spade.

1226
01:23:24,374 --> 01:23:28,276
And saying, pardon me, but I'd prefer
if you wouldn't sleep with my fiance.

1227
01:23:30,713 --> 01:23:32,442
You got the wrong idea here, pal.

1228
01:23:32,649 --> 01:23:34,378
Don't call me "pal."

1229
01:23:34,684 --> 01:23:37,619
I'm not your pal.
And don't treat me like an idiot.

1230
01:23:37,820 --> 01:23:40,380
Do me that one courtesy,
because I'm not that, either.

1231
01:23:40,590 --> 01:23:43,718
In fact, I've got more brain cells...

1232
01:23:43,927 --> 01:23:46,794
...than your entire redneck family
all put together.

1233
01:23:46,996 --> 01:23:47,894
Don't be a jerk.

1234
01:23:48,097 --> 01:23:50,156
Gwen, don't be a slut.
Back off, pal.

1235
01:23:55,572 --> 01:23:57,301
Go. Go.

1236
01:24:00,944 --> 01:24:03,242
-Let me see it. Let me just--
-Get off!

1237
01:24:10,453 --> 01:24:12,421
Let's put some ice on it.

1238
01:24:12,789 --> 01:24:14,086
Come on.

1239
01:24:14,958 --> 01:24:16,152
This way.

1240
01:24:45,221 --> 01:24:46,210
Honey, wake up.

1241
01:24:47,190 --> 01:24:49,317
Somebody! Somebody! Come!

1242
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:52,951
Gwen, what is it?

1243
01:24:54,731 --> 01:24:55,857
Go back in your rooms!

1244
01:24:56,232 --> 01:24:58,723
What did you do?
Your hands are so cold.

1245
01:24:58,935 --> 01:24:59,799
Hurry up!

1246
01:25:00,336 --> 01:25:01,325
What happened?

1247
01:25:01,537 --> 01:25:03,129
-She took that.
-Well, what?

1248
01:25:03,339 --> 01:25:05,330
I don't know what this is!
Get somebody!

1249
01:25:05,575 --> 01:25:07,907
We have an emergency.
Send an ambulance.

1250
01:25:08,845 --> 01:25:09,869
Let me in.

1251
01:25:10,079 --> 01:25:11,376
Get back in your rooms!

1252
01:25:20,323 --> 01:25:22,120
Oh, Jesus.

1253
01:25:29,766 --> 01:25:34,169
I'd rath erbe dreaming than living

1254
01:25:35,071 --> 01:25:38,234
Living's just too hard to do

1255
01:25:40,343 --> 01:25:42,937
It's chances, not choices

1256
01:25:43,279 --> 01:25:45,804
Noises, not voices

1257
01:25:46,282 --> 01:25:50,548
A day's just a thing to get thro ugh

1258
01:25:52,021 --> 01:25:54,990
Living's just too hard to do

1259
01:25:57,326 --> 01:26:00,261
Dreams might be pretend

1260
01:26:00,463 --> 01:26:02,761
But at least dreams end

1261
01:26:02,965 --> 01:26:07,902
And ljust can't stop thinking, you see

1262
01:26:09,038 --> 01:26:12,997
Th ought's a small comfort to me

1263
01:26:14,410 --> 01:26:18,346
We as a community have all been
deeply affected by our loss.

1264
01:26:18,548 --> 01:26:22,484
I'd like to begin with how I feel.
And that's...

1265
01:26:22,819 --> 01:26:24,184
...scared.

1266
01:26:25,488 --> 01:26:29,982
Because I've heard so many people here
say, "l just want to use one more time."

1267
01:26:32,395 --> 01:26:35,887
Andrea's "one more time"
was what killed her.

1268
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:39,700
She didn't kill herself.

1269
01:26:40,269 --> 01:26:41,827
She used.

1270
01:26:42,171 --> 01:26:43,832
She overdosed.

1271
01:26:44,607 --> 01:26:46,097
That's what happens....

1272
01:26:52,148 --> 01:26:53,410
There's nothing...

1273
01:26:54,050 --> 01:26:57,451
...you or I or anybody
could've done about it.

1274
01:26:58,287 --> 01:27:01,085
It's important.
You need to understand this.

1275
01:27:20,109 --> 01:27:21,406
It's me.

1276
01:27:22,645 --> 01:27:23,771
What happened?

1277
01:27:26,048 --> 01:27:27,606
Are you all right?

1278
01:28:12,929 --> 01:28:14,157
Gwennie?

1279
01:28:15,198 --> 01:28:16,324
I'm sorry.

1280
01:28:18,768 --> 01:28:20,360
I don't know....

1281
01:28:22,872 --> 01:28:25,500
You want to know how I feel?

1282
01:28:27,276 --> 01:28:30,541
How I always felt around you?

1283
01:28:32,949 --> 01:28:33,938
Small.

1284
01:28:35,351 --> 01:28:37,046
You have this...

1285
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:39,519
...way.

1286
01:28:40,122 --> 01:28:42,454
You know, it's that Mom thing.

1287
01:28:42,658 --> 01:28:45,286
That amazing gravitational force.

1288
01:28:45,561 --> 01:28:49,327
Even when she was a mess, you know,
the world noticed her.

1289
01:28:51,033 --> 01:28:52,022
You have that.

1290
01:28:53,536 --> 01:28:55,026
And I guess...

1291
01:28:55,805 --> 01:28:59,366
...l figured that
you always knew that.

1292
01:29:00,977 --> 01:29:04,071
I don't know.
When I went back home...

1293
01:29:05,715 --> 01:29:07,808
...l started thinking.

1294
01:29:09,085 --> 01:29:12,543
And maybe you don't know that...

1295
01:29:13,489 --> 01:29:15,150
...about yourself.

1296
01:29:18,261 --> 01:29:21,196
I mean, who would've told you,
you know? Not me.

1297
01:29:22,164 --> 01:29:24,428
The only thing I ever told you was...

1298
01:29:24,634 --> 01:29:26,693
...what a pain in the ass you were.

1299
01:29:29,438 --> 01:29:31,463
I am a pain in the ass.

1300
01:29:33,609 --> 01:29:36,169
Even a pain in the ass needs...

1301
01:29:36,612 --> 01:29:38,102
...someone...

1302
01:29:39,015 --> 01:29:40,778
...to take care of them.

1303
01:29:43,953 --> 01:29:45,716
I didn't do that.

1304
01:29:47,623 --> 01:29:49,022
I didn't...

1305
01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:53,355
...and I should have.

1306
01:29:56,365 --> 01:29:59,493
I should have helped you
with your homework.

1307
01:30:00,369 --> 01:30:03,236
I should have walked you home
after school.

1308
01:30:05,241 --> 01:30:09,302
Sometimes I'd be walking
with my friends, and I'd see you...

1309
01:30:10,179 --> 01:30:13,239
...half a block ahead, all alone.

1310
01:30:14,550 --> 01:30:16,313
You were so little.

1311
01:30:18,354 --> 01:30:20,982
Well, so were you.

1312
01:30:26,395 --> 01:30:29,228
I never asked for help, so....

1313
01:30:31,901 --> 01:30:34,836
But you needed it. Didn't you?

1314
01:30:36,439 --> 01:30:38,236
And everybody does.

1315
01:30:40,710 --> 01:30:41,768
Yep.

1316
01:30:59,862 --> 01:31:02,422
I'm sorry I make it
so impossible to love me.

1317
01:31:02,631 --> 01:31:05,930
You make it impossible
for me not to love you.

1318
01:31:28,891 --> 01:31:31,155
Ninety meetings in ninety days.

1319
01:31:31,394 --> 01:31:33,988
And ask for help. It's always there.

1320
01:31:34,230 --> 01:31:35,219
Anything else?

1321
01:31:35,431 --> 01:31:37,228
Just goodbye.

1322
01:31:40,236 --> 01:31:43,034
Jeremiah was a bullfrog

1323
01:31:43,239 --> 01:31:45,707
Was a good friend ofmine

1324
01:31:45,908 --> 01:31:49,173
I never understood
A single word he said

1325
01:31:49,378 --> 01:31:52,814
But I help ed him drink his wine

1326
01:31:53,215 --> 01:31:56,184
And he always had
Some mighty fine wine

1327
01:31:56,685 --> 01:31:58,152
Take care, sweetie.

1328
01:31:58,354 --> 01:31:59,844
Joy to th e world

1329
01:32:01,524 --> 01:32:03,754
All th e boys and girls

1330
01:32:05,194 --> 01:32:08,595
Joy to th e fishes
ln th e deep blue sea

1331
01:32:09,031 --> 01:32:11,261
Joy to you and me

1332
01:32:12,868 --> 01:32:16,133
Ifl were th e king of th e world

1333
01:32:16,505 --> 01:32:19,770
I'll tell you what I'd do

1334
01:32:20,276 --> 01:32:23,871
I'd thro w away th e cars
And th e bras and th e war

1335
01:32:24,113 --> 01:32:27,105
And make sweet love to you

1336
01:32:35,191 --> 01:32:37,022
Look, I messed up.

1337
01:32:37,726 --> 01:32:39,421
I got riled up.

1338
01:32:39,628 --> 01:32:43,530
There isn't a lot I can do
about it now, except to say I'm sorry.

1339
01:32:45,801 --> 01:32:48,292
And you know, people make mistakes.

1340
01:32:49,238 --> 01:32:51,706
If you can't handle that, if you....

1341
01:32:52,808 --> 01:32:54,241
If you want to decide that...

1342
01:32:54,477 --> 01:32:57,571
...my messing up means I'm not
worth being your friend...

1343
01:32:57,780 --> 01:32:59,907
...then you're not as smart
as you think you are.

1344
01:33:03,052 --> 01:33:04,986
That guy, Jasper.

1345
01:33:05,554 --> 01:33:07,078
I don't know him.

1346
01:33:07,756 --> 01:33:11,852
But I do know that
he is dangerous for you.

1347
01:34:34,343 --> 01:34:35,401
Wait.

1348
01:34:36,579 --> 01:34:37,568
Turkey.

1349
01:34:38,013 --> 01:34:41,107
Meant to be symbolic of my behavior
last time we saw each other.

1350
01:34:41,317 --> 01:34:43,649
I tried to track down
some roasted asshole, but....

1351
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:46,610
Listen, all right?

1352
01:34:47,022 --> 01:34:50,514
I've been thinking about us.
I can change if you want me to.

1353
01:34:50,726 --> 01:34:53,388
And we can have a totally
different life. All right?

1354
01:34:53,596 --> 01:34:55,223
I'll buy running shoes.

1355
01:34:55,431 --> 01:34:58,491
We'll take up yoga or jogging.
We'll be organized.

1356
01:34:58,701 --> 01:35:00,498
Pay our bills, floss our teeth.

1357
01:35:00,703 --> 01:35:02,864
We won't set fire
to the apartment anymore.

1358
01:35:03,105 --> 01:35:05,835
I'll buy a goldfish,
and we'll be like normal people.

1359
01:35:06,542 --> 01:35:08,032
You hate normal people.

1360
01:35:08,277 --> 01:35:11,110
No. What I hate is being without you.

1361
01:35:13,983 --> 01:35:16,281
You don't want to do this
on your own, do you?

1362
01:35:20,856 --> 01:35:22,118
We have to go.

1363
01:35:22,324 --> 01:35:24,986
Ten people die, but 500 people have
an amazing time...

1364
01:35:25,194 --> 01:35:28,129
...chasing this cheese
in the middle of the Cotswolds.

1365
01:35:28,330 --> 01:35:32,027
The only person who dies,
should really die, is old women.

1366
01:35:32,234 --> 01:35:34,725
Jasper, do you ever shut up?

1367
01:35:36,338 --> 01:35:37,270
I'm sorry.

1368
01:35:37,473 --> 01:35:40,271
But it's just that, you know,
if I'm gonna really--

1369
01:35:40,476 --> 01:35:43,138
Stay clean and sober,
as they say in the program.

1370
01:35:44,313 --> 01:35:47,248
Yeah. But it's not that simple.

1371
01:35:47,750 --> 01:35:49,479
Everything has to be different.

1372
01:35:49,685 --> 01:35:51,016
Absolutely.

1373
01:35:51,420 --> 01:35:54,014
And that includes us.

1374
01:35:54,223 --> 01:35:58,250
I'm trying to change things in me.

1375
01:35:58,494 --> 01:36:00,792
-I'm trying to--
-Look who's here.

1376
01:36:01,363 --> 01:36:02,762
Hey, Marty.

1377
01:36:03,832 --> 01:36:04,764
Elaine, look.

1378
01:36:05,234 --> 01:36:06,895
I was hoping I'd find you here.

1379
01:36:07,102 --> 01:36:10,970
My God, she's alive.
Gwennie's back in action.

1380
01:36:11,173 --> 01:36:14,438
Celebrate with us. We got a
monster table going in the back.

1381
01:36:14,677 --> 01:36:15,735
Excellent idea.

1382
01:36:16,111 --> 01:36:18,238
We're in the middle of something now.

1383
01:36:18,447 --> 01:36:19,778
Oh, come on, Gwennie.

1384
01:36:22,718 --> 01:36:25,186
Give us a couple of minutes.
We'll be over.

1385
01:36:28,691 --> 01:36:30,420
That was really embarrassing.

1386
01:36:46,208 --> 01:36:47,869
Where are you going?

1387
01:36:48,377 --> 01:36:49,537
They're waiting.

1388
01:36:50,779 --> 01:36:53,748
We'll just go in the back,
have a soda water, and then go.

1389
01:36:53,949 --> 01:36:56,611
They just want to say welcome home.
Come on.

1390
01:37:03,058 --> 01:37:04,116
What are you doing?

1391
01:37:04,326 --> 01:37:08,729
I don't know. I'm just trying to make
my outsides match my insides, I guess.

1392
01:37:10,899 --> 01:37:12,230
Leave the horse alone.

1393
01:37:13,168 --> 01:37:14,635
Oh, come on.

1394
01:37:21,844 --> 01:37:23,641
I just need help!

1395
01:37:23,846 --> 01:37:25,643
Right now!

1396
01:37:40,195 --> 01:37:43,164
I can control the little things.

1397
01:37:44,500 --> 01:37:46,764
Then I just have to let go.

1398
01:37:48,036 --> 01:37:50,766
And it's up to somebody else.

1399
01:38:01,116 --> 01:38:02,845
The hoof's looking pretty good.

1400
01:38:03,819 --> 01:38:06,117
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

1401
01:38:06,321 --> 01:38:07,686
Are we all fixed now?

1402
01:38:08,824 --> 01:38:10,451
Not yet...

1403
01:38:11,126 --> 01:38:12,593
...but I'm getting there.

1404
01:38:12,795 --> 01:38:14,888
What else have you gotta do?
Check his teeth?

1405
01:38:26,809 --> 01:38:27,969
Bye, Jasper.

1406
01:38:55,838 --> 01:39:00,070
Sir, I can't replace the plant
just because you killed it.

1407
01:39:00,275 --> 01:39:01,469
I did not kill it.

1408
01:39:01,677 --> 01:39:04,908
It was sick or something.
I gave it everything.

1409
01:39:05,113 --> 01:39:07,206
I was talking to it,
telling it stories.

1410
01:39:07,416 --> 01:39:10,010
I drew a sketch of it
and put it on my refrigerator.

1411
01:39:10,219 --> 01:39:11,880
Did you water it?

1412
01:39:14,690 --> 01:39:18,421
It's important that I did not kill
this plant. Do you understand?

1413
01:39:18,627 --> 01:39:21,425
If you're just saying that
because that's your excuse...

1414
01:39:21,630 --> 01:39:23,427
...you have to understand....

1415
01:39:24,766 --> 01:39:27,599
You can't mess with--
I'm never gonna get laid.

1416
01:39:28,871 --> 01:39:33,535
You obviously don't care.
And that's one thing I do, is care.

1417
01:39:33,775 --> 01:39:35,970
I feel sorry for
all the plants in here.

1418
01:39:37,913 --> 01:39:39,471
I'm going home.

1419
01:39:44,219 --> 01:39:46,084
I killed the plant.

1420
01:39:46,822 --> 01:39:48,790
It's okay. It's okay.

1421
01:39:48,991 --> 01:39:51,016
I killed the plant.

1422
01:39:51,226 --> 01:39:54,627
It's okay. You still have your dog.

1423
01:39:55,397 --> 01:39:57,888
I don't even think he likes me.

1424
01:39:58,901 --> 01:40:01,734
I don't want to, I just....

1425
01:40:03,472 --> 01:40:06,236
What are you doing here?
It's so good to see you!

1426
01:40:56,792 --> 01:41:01,456
It looks like somewhere
out in the middle of nowhere.

1427
01:41:02,197 --> 01:41:03,926
-I see trees--
-No cell phones.

1428
01:41:04,132 --> 01:41:07,192
We carry our own bags here.
This isn't the Sheraton.

1429
01:41:11,173 --> 01:41:12,504
Hey, Falcon.

1430
01:41:12,908 --> 01:41:14,000
What?

1431
01:41:15,777 --> 01:41:17,540
I don't mean to bother you, but....

1432
01:41:18,413 --> 01:41:22,975
Don't miss tonight's lecture:
"ls God An Alcoholic?"
