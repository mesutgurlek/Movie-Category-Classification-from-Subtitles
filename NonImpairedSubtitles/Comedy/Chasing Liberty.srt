1
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:08,033
Of course you can kiss me.

2
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:27,684
Of course you can kiss me.

3
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:29,821
Of course you can kiss me.

4
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:31,920
You can kiss me.

5
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:41,225
- Identification, please.
- Hi. Grant Hillman.

6
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:43,919
- That's H-I...
- Just the ID, please.

7
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:48,999
L'm here to pick up...

8
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:53,600
Okay.

9
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:56,867
- Grant Hillman picking up Liberty.
- He's clear.

10
00:02:57,477 --> 00:03:01,379
It's not often you come here for a date.
Maybe when Clinton was in office.

11
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:03,846
Would you please get out the car?

12
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,678
That was a joke.

13
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,587
Seriously, how many guns
are pointed at me right now?

14
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:13,317
L'll need those flowers too.

15
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:26,698
Hi, Grant.

16
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:34,539
Thank you, Mark.

17
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:44,452
These were for you.
They would have impressed you.

18
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:47,889
No, no, no. They still do.
They died for their country.

19
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:52,495
- Do you wanna get out of here?
- More than you know.

20
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:04,739
Alone at last.

21
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:45,409
<i>All agents are in position. If possible,</i>
<i>can you walk me out a latte? Iced, soy.</i>

22
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:51,079
L am so glad you finally asked me out.
It wasn't that hard, was it?

23
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:53,782
Come on, I'm easy. L'm...

24
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,428
Okay, I'm not really easy, but...

25
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:59,292
I'll shut up, because
I don't know what I'm saying.

26
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:02,056
L have wanted to ask you out
for a long time.

27
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,661
- But I was a little intimidated.
- Because of my father?

28
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:09,137
No, because you're easy.
L'm just going off what you said.

29
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:12,307
<i>Looks like Liberty found herself</i>
<i>a good one this time.</i>

30
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,170
L hate first dates. Too painful.

31
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:19,910
- For you or the girl?
- All I want is to love and be loved, Morales.

32
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:24,890
- Hi.
- Hi.

33
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,859
Would you like to take a picture?

34
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,494
- That would be great.
- Okay. Come here.

35
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:32,995
- Go.
- You can stand here.

36
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,829
We're visiting from Florida.
L voted for your father.

37
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,903
My husband didn't,
but we split up...

38
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:42,841
...but not because of that!
There were other things too.

39
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,978
But I got the girls!
Lilly, get over there.

40
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:48,340
Come here. Here we go. Stand here.

41
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:52,212
Thanks.

42
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,651
- Oh, that's great. Thank you.
- You're so welcome.

43
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:59,656
- Girls. Come on.
- Have fun. Enjoy Washington.

44
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:02,556
Thank you.

45
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:08,231
- Is that Anna Foster?
- How can you stand to have people...

46
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:11,928
...staring at you all the time?
- It's part of the job description.

47
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,073
After six years in the White House...

48
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,301
...and eight as the governor's daughter,
I don't really know anything else.

49
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:22,278
L think you'd get all this attention
if you weren't the first daughter.

50
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:24,146
Yeah.

51
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:31,719
You look good in that blouse.
You should wear that more often.

52
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,155
<i>Actually, it's a sweater.</i>

53
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,557
Sweater, blouse, you wear it well.
Take a compliment.

54
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:42,123
- Have you heard from Rhode Island?
- I got in.

55
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:46,101
- Congratulations. L knew you would.
- My parents are pushing premed.

56
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:51,437
L think parents want you to appreciate
the good things in life, but not do them.

57
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:54,739
- They want you to see art...
- We got something at 9:00.

58
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:58,907
- But not make art. They want you
to have love, find love and value love...

59
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,985
...but not make love, ever.

60
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:03,622
Thought I'd make this night
more memorable.

61
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,417
He's reaching. Go!

62
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:08,793
- What are you guys doing?
- Wait, these are my friends.

63
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:11,521
- You don't know what you're doing!
- Get off me!

64
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:18,261
This street is off-limits.

65
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,735
It's only a camera.

66
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:22,170
<i>Okay, folks, it's over.</i>
<i>Clear the street.</i>

67
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:25,208
- L'm so sorry.
- I should wait for them.

68
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:28,142
No, come on, it's still early.

69
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:30,942
We could go catch a movie or something.

70
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:33,849
Anna...

71
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:36,982
...you are really great.

72
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:40,515
But this is just way
too out of control for me.

73
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:43,052
L'm sorry.

74
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:53,133
Of course you can kiss me.

75
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:01,537
Weiss to Control.
Returning home with Liberty.

76
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,391
Good night.

77
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:24,330
- Poor kid.
- All right, well, at least she's home safe.

78
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,472
How about I get you home safe?

79
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,370
- How about I call you when I get there?
- Sure.

80
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:37,108
- You're not gonna call me, are you?
- No.

81
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,412
It's out of my way, anyway!

82
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:00,868
- How was the date?
- I need to talk to him.

83
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,100
- I can't let you in there, Anna.
- Anna, wait.

84
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:07,102
- Go on.
- L'm not going.

85
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:10,846
Dad.

86
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:16,117
Way to go. L can't believe
you had that restaurant swarming...

87
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:18,951
...with your secret servants.
You ruined my date!

88
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:22,117
And now I'm gonna die
before I ever get to third base.

89
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:26,825
L mean second base.

90
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:38,874
Anna?

91
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:43,072
- Talk to you about this later.
- No. No, stay.

92
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:46,844
Pull up a chair. We're just discussing
the G8 Summit in Prague.

93
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:50,750
How to persuade the EU to adopt our plan
to give humanitarian aid...

94
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,414
...and medical technology
to developing nations.

95
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,891
But you had a bad date...

96
00:09:56,062 --> 00:10:00,931
...so we should probably focus on that.
- No, I'm so sorry to have interrupted.

97
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,965
Excuse me.

98
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:08,101
So third base is what again?

99
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:13,675
- I always thought it was below the waist.
- I don't remember, sir.

100
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:15,711
Maybe that was just cheerleaders.

101
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:18,479
Glad I asked.

102
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,259
Anna...

103
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:31,555
...I know that dating is
a little more difficult for you.

104
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,528
Try "impossible."

105
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:36,463
And you know that
the extra security is necessary.

106
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,737
They ruined her date.
She really likes this boy.

107
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:42,768
Oh, okay.

108
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:46,469
A boy who ranks 24th in his class,
plays Xbox two hours a day...

109
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,672
...and wants to go to art school.
- Who told you that?

110
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:51,817
- Phil.
- Okay, I don't want some guy...

111
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:55,249
...who wears his sunglasses
inside at night... Sorry, Phil.

112
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:59,517
Listening in on my dinner dates.
That is such a total abuse of power.

113
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:04,061
L am 18 years old and I wanna go out
on a date without guys in bad suits...

114
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:09,167
Sorry, Harper. Hiding behind every tree.
Nothing is private.

115
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,701
Sweetie, I am just trying to protect you.

116
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:17,400
Dad, I'm not that 12-year-old girl who would
only dance with you at your inaugural ball.

117
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,346
You're right.

118
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,574
Excuse me, sir.
It's the vice president on the phone.

119
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,475
He says it's urgent.

120
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:31,682
Dad. You can make it up to me
when we're in Prague.

121
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:34,886
We'll see.

122
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:38,292
- Remember Gabrielle Le Clerc?
- French ambassador's daughter.

123
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:42,594
She'll be in Prague and she's invited
me to this concert. And I wanna go.

124
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:47,068
Yes, Gabrielle. Pierre's little girl.
It's all right, I suppose.

125
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:49,730
Without the army. One agent.

126
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,704
Thank you, Mom. Yeah, one agent.

127
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:57,713
- Two. Weiss and Morales. Final offer.
- Just Weiss and Morales, promise?

128
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:02,479
- Never ask a president to promise, honey.
- L'm not. L'm asking my dad.

129
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:04,486
Promise?

130
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:06,289
Promise.

131
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:13,060
Later, maybe we can talk about me leaving
Prague to go to the Berlin Love Parade.

132
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,393
- Forget it.
- L've been reading about it...

133
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:19,334
...and it's basically one big peace rally.
- No, it's basically an orgy.

134
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:22,997
Not if I keep my top on
and I go like this a lot:

135
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,276
It's not going to happen, Anna.

136
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:31,473
- The answer's no.
- Sir, vice president. Still waiting.

137
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:34,579
President. Still president.

138
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:45,359
- Z-Y-G-O-T-E.
- Very good.

139
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:47,328
Z ygote.

140
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,195
Ten, 20, 40 points.

141
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:52,997
Okay. In Prague, I will fulfill
all my diplomatic obligations.

142
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:56,164
L'll go to the reception,
the concert with Gabrielle...

143
00:12:56,342 --> 00:13:00,802
...where I will be escorted by two agents,
stay out as late as I want.

144
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,847
Next day, I'll have every moment
accounted for again.

145
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:07,247
Two days later, I go to the Love Parade,
meet you in Prague...

146
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:09,683
...go to college, love you, fantastic plan.

147
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:14,656
Take out the Love Parade,
you got yourself a deal. H-A-T.

148
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:18,058
Hat. Eight points.

149
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:19,659
Damn.

150
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:24,963
Dad, I'm 18, and if you let me go
to the Love Parade, maybe I'll vote for you.

151
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:28,937
- You are a very funny child.
- Mom.

152
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:35,206
Q-U-l-V-E-R-S.

153
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:39,317
That is a triple-word score
with a seven-letter bonus...

154
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,646
...makes 144 points.

155
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:44,082
- Damn.
- Damn.

156
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:10,572
<i>It's been busy</i>
<i>for America's first family in Prague...</i>

157
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:12,683
<i>... during this G8 Summit week.</i>

158
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:18,085
<i>First daughter Anna Foster took a carriage</i>
<i>ride with the mayor of Prague and his wife.</i>

159
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:21,715
<i>After a press conference,</i>
<i>a tour of the Air Force Museum...</i>

160
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:26,854
<i>... with the minister of culture,</i>
<i>then a caricature on Charles Bridge...</i>

161
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:30,092
<i>... a photo op with high school students</i>
<i>at Prague Castle...</i>

162
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:34,638
<i>... and even a few moments entertaining</i>
<i>children at the Prague Marionette Theater.</i>

163
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:37,275
<i>It seems Anna Foster's</i>
<i>diplomatic skills...</i>

164
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:41,004
<i>... are on the way to matching</i>
<i>those of her father, President Foster.</i>

165
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:46,015
<i>The day ended with a presidential</i>
<i>banquet at the National Museum.</i>

166
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:58,196
Anna.

167
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:01,633
- Gabrielle! How are you?
- Good.

168
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,734
- Gabrielle?
- L'm sorry I am late...

169
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,667
...but the guards outside
took turns to search me.

170
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:11,840
- Gabrielle, you're all grown up.
- It happens.

171
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:24,549
- What's that in your mouth, candy?
- No, it's pierced.

172
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:26,588
- You like it?
- No.

173
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:30,995
Remind me to commission
a study and find out...

174
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:33,961
...why on Earth anyone wants
to pierce their tongue.

175
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:38,627
L'll save your country's money.
See, some guys think it makes for better...

176
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:42,237
Gabrielle, let's go mingle over here.

177
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:45,109
She's a nice girl.

178
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:48,872
- Wonder what else she has pierced.
- Oh, relax, Jim.

179
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:53,985
- How should I relax?
- Set up an embargo. You love those.

180
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,815
Have you been smoking?

181
00:15:56,989 --> 00:16:01,016
L had a cigar with the prime minister.
It's rude if you don't.

182
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:06,460
L love champagne.

183
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:10,261
Yes, and 18 is okay in Europe, so...

184
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:16,067
I don't believe they're still following you.
Go away, men with guns.

185
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:21,274
It's no good. L've tried.
Even in English, they don't get it.

186
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:26,214
L don't know how you stand it. L got rid
of my babysitters when I was, like, 14.

187
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:31,220
Yeah, I'm afraid it doesn't work
like that in the "land of the free."

188
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,187
Cheers.

189
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:41,361
What?

190
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:59,778
Thank God Gabrielle found another
trashy friend to hang out with.

191
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:03,615
Yes. Your daughter.

192
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:10,353
Bye, Mom. And thank you
so much again, Dad. Bye.

193
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,861
See? He loved the hair.

194
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:16,426
Little change in plans, Mr. President?

195
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:20,060
Oh, you two have been
with me a long time.

196
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:26,308
We spend the day at the Love Parade
and then we go to my friend's club.

197
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:29,504
It's the hottest place in the whole city.

198
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:31,615
That's okay.

199
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:34,981
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

200
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:37,884
What a great idea, to change my hair.
It's perfect.

201
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,821
- Yes, I told you.
- No one knows who I am.

202
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,055
- You get jet lag, Morales?
- No.

203
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:48,325
- Really? L get it awful.
- I take herbs.

204
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,024
- Herbs?
- Yep.

205
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:53,729
- Really? Why?
- They help reset your clock.

206
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,602
L'd like to reset your clock.

207
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:58,775
L'm just saying.

208
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:05,047
- Gabby, I am so excited. L feel so free.
- You're going to love it.

209
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:08,311
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Excuse me.

210
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:10,785
- Anna, come on.
- It's okay.

211
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:13,183
There's plenty more inside.

212
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:22,865
Gabby, you are so right.
There are lots of cute guys here.

213
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:28,496
Oh, and wait till the Berlin Love Parade.
500,000 cute guys.

214
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:31,871
- Sounds like so much fun. L can't wait.
- It's gonna be crazy.

215
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,741
Here we are.

216
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:27,421
Hey, yo. Break it down.

217
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:29,400
Break it down for me.

218
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:32,059
Spread your wings,
ladies and gentlemen.

219
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:37,470
You are now rocking with the best,
hard-working, revolution sure-shot.

220
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,019
What?

221
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:01,062
No.

222
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,230
No! No way!

223
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:08,736
No way! He said just two of you.

224
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:13,904
- No, that's just security...
- Don't worry about it. They're local guys.

225
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:18,077
Liberty's heading out to the bathroom.

226
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,713
Got her.

227
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:35,490
L can't believe he did it again.

228
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:39,330
He completely broke his promise.
Don't I deserve one night of freedom?

229
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:42,905
L'm not even talking freedom.
Two agents.

230
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:49,242
Oh, my God, Anna. L have a great plan.

231
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,748
Don't look back. Don't look back.

232
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:02,087
- L'm saying... Anna?
- Anna! Anna!

233
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:08,194
- Secure the perimeters. Liberty's AWOL.
- Anna, run!

234
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:16,503
Anna! Anna!

235
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:23,044
Oh, God.

236
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,281
Excuse me.

237
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,817
- Sir, excuse me.
- You all right?

238
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:31,855
Could you please help me get out of here?

239
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:35,826
- Yeah, why not?
- Thank you.

240
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:37,791
Stop!

241
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:40,730
- Get them!
- Go, go, go.

242
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,499
Go!

243
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,467
Oh, my God. L can't believe I just did that.

244
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:06,355
L'm on fire! L'm untouchable!
L'm Anna. Who are you?

245
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:08,789
Ben Calder. Freelance getaway man.

246
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,985
Yeah, need the hand. Need the hand.

247
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:27,437
Thank you, thank you,
thank you so much, Mr. Ben.

248
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:31,708
You're welcome. L think. Depending on
what crime I've just aided and abetted.

249
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:34,977
No. No, no crime. L don't think.

250
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:38,145
Thank you again, very much. Thanks.

251
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:42,487
Anna? Do you have a last name?

252
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:48,127
No, actually, it's just... It's Anna. Like Pink.

253
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,234
Thank you again.

254
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:55,335
Actually, I need another ride, if that's okay.
Very fast. Like, right now.

255
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:59,375
Whatever you say, Mrs. Bond.

256
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:08,075
They're chasing us! They're chasing us!

257
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:17,224
Go, go, go, go, go.

258
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,943
Ben, I think we just lost them.

259
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:40,346
Oh, we lost them, did we?

260
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:44,250
- So why the wild ride, Anna?
- Concert security.

261
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:47,085
L snuck in, they caught me.
Chaos erupted.

262
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:50,660
Yeah, because they always give
giant chase vehicles to bouncers.

263
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:53,992
Maybe there was a little bit more
involved than just that.

264
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:57,795
- Almost always is, isn't there?
- Yeah.

265
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:06,343
Well, I'm gonna go.

266
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:08,510
So...

267
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:12,112
Thank you so much for the ride, Ben.
L appreciate it.

268
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:18,012
Bye.

269
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:20,914
Oh, wait.

270
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:25,328
Helmet?

271
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:30,658
So sorry. Thanks.

272
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:37,304
- You're sure you know where you're going?
- Yes.

273
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:40,306
No.

274
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:44,347
L'm supposed to be meeting a friend
of mine at this bar, Marquis de Sade.

275
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:48,316
- Do you have any idea where that is?
- Hang on.

276
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:55,325
Mate, it's me. L've got a question for you.
Marquis de Sade bar, what's the address?

277
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:58,258
The corner of Jakubska and Templova.

278
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:01,365
Okay, yeah. See you later, mate. Bye.

279
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:08,900
Ben, I know you probably think
I'm this really rude...

280
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:11,099
Thank you.

281
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:16,613
Hold on.

282
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:33,388
- So you a big drinker?
- I drink.

283
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:40,871
- You're not drinking?
- You're getting pissed for the both of us.

284
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:45,201
So where are you headed?

285
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:47,770
L am kind of...

286
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:52,076
...backpacking through Europe
on my way to Berlin for the Love Parade.

287
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:55,048
Oh, right.
Where's your backpack?

288
00:25:56,288 --> 00:26:01,055
- Backpacking is just an expression.
- Oh, yeah.

289
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,887
For what?

290
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:10,292
Fine. Okay, fine. You caught me.
L'm on vacation here with my parents...

291
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:15,906
...and it's this numbing series of five-star
hotels and seven-course brunches.

292
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:19,532
- And I just can't take it anymore.
- It's tough to take, I guess.

293
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:23,010
You know, chocolate mint
on your silk pillow. Nightmare.

294
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:34,458
So...

295
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,684
...what's your story?

296
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:40,592
L mean, like, why are you here
all by your eyelashes?

297
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:47,937
- I mean, self.
- Well, actually, I'm here on holiday.

298
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:54,637
Indulging in my passion for photography.
Taking pictures of European architecture...

299
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:58,715
...and drunk teenage fugitives, of course.
- Hey. L'm not some drunk...

300
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:02,944
Holy shit.

301
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:07,517
L have to go. Oh, God, I have to go.

302
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:13,019
Why don't you duck into the loos
and, kind of, kill two birds sort of thing.

303
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:16,026
You...

304
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:19,059
You are great.

305
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:23,503
You. You stay here, you. Okay?

306
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:25,666
Be back.

307
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:38,087
- What took you so long?
- Why'd you leave, Agent Calder?

308
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:40,486
You should have stopped her
at the concert.

309
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:44,595
And let the first daughter cause a scene
with photographers hanging around?

310
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:48,859
She's yours. She's hiding in the loos
and drunk, so I'm sure she'll go easy.

311
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:51,002
L'll check in with you later.

312
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:56,974
- He's tall.
- What?

313
00:27:57,142 --> 00:27:59,042
He's tall. Great.

314
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:02,646
- She ran off with a stranger.
- You said he was Secret Service.

315
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:06,545
- It smells like wet cigars.
- She does not know he's Secret Service.

316
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:09,016
L think the maid was smoking.

317
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:11,648
She's desperate for freedom, Jim.

318
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:14,553
You pushed her into this
with your lack of trust.

319
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:17,354
You'd tell me if you started
smoking again, right?

320
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:22,125
You want me to trust some person that
would go off with a complete stranger?

321
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,929
- Of course I'd tell you.
- I thought you said he was Secret Service.

322
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:30,541
- She does not know that.
- The maid smokes cigars?

323
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:34,008
Wait. She doesn't know that.

324
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:37,444
How can a president
with a 63 percent approval rating...

325
00:28:37,615 --> 00:28:40,880
...have absolutely no understanding
of his teenage daughter?

326
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:43,714
She needs at least
the illusion of independence.

327
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:46,948
That's exactly what I'm gonna give her.

328
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:49,918
Phil! Harper!

329
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:53,029
- Yes, Mr. President.
- Tell me about Ben Calder.

330
00:28:53,198 --> 00:28:55,564
Very capable. Youngest agent in Europe.

331
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:59,966
Father was American. Respected CIA.
Killed in the line of duty seven years ago.

332
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:02,572
Ben was raised in England
by a British mother.

333
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,971
- Harper, get Ben Calder on the phone.
- Sir.

334
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:08,544
- Phil, contact Weiss and Morales.
- Sir.

335
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,875
- What are you doing?
- Get Calder.

336
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:13,779
She wants freedom? Let freedom ring.

337
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:17,080
- I don't know if he can handle that.
- What do you want now?

338
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,485
- <i>Ben Calder.</i>
- Whatever you say.

339
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:23,115
- Mr. President, hello.
- I want you to keep our daughter.

340
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:25,626
- Sir?
- Make sure she has no idea who you are.

341
00:29:25,797 --> 00:29:27,492
- But, Jim...
- But, sir...

342
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:31,601
Weiss and Morales are being informed
of this plan as we speak.

343
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,330
- <i>James.</i>
- Mr. President, with all due respect...

344
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:38,602
All due respect would mean accepting
this duty without protest, Calder.

345
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,211
- My apologies.
- I know my daughter.

346
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:44,177
Without MTV and clean sheets
she'll beg to come home.

347
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:45,941
What if she doesn't, sir?

348
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:49,211
The point is to get a little rebellion
out of her system...

349
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:53,380
<i>... without risk to her</i>
<i>or revealing your identity. Ever.</i>

350
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:57,794
And that's paramount, Calder. Ever.

351
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,965
It's all you, baby.

352
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:08,494
- I don't think we should be doing this.
- I want Anna to be happy.

353
00:30:08,673 --> 00:30:11,506
You think the only way
is to give her freedom...

354
00:30:11,676 --> 00:30:13,337
...so that's what I'm doing.

355
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:17,174
Only, I'm gonna be the one
controlling that freedom.

356
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:21,552
Trust me. It's perfect diplomacy in action.

357
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:28,389
They just left?

358
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:33,998
Yeah, I guess you gave them the slip.
Too smart for them, hey?

359
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:36,533
So I'm free.

360
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:44,639
Yes! L finally will get
to experience the real Prague.

361
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:47,937
L wanna taste it. L wanna smell it.

362
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:50,637
Be sure to smell it before you taste it.

363
00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:54,342
- Ben, I wanna find passion...
- Awful.

364
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,749
- Sorry about that, we're just...
- Yeah.

365
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:58,183
Looking for passion.

366
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:06,520
Tell you what. Second thoughts.
Why don't we just forget the bike.

367
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,029
Okay. Sorry.

368
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:54,240
It's so beautiful.

369
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:57,472
- Okay, now you've seen it. Let's go.
- Hold this.

370
00:31:58,149 --> 00:32:01,118
- What are you doing?
- L'm taking my clothes off.

371
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:07,450
- Can you please stop it?
- I told you, I wanna experience freedom...

372
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:09,217
...at its utmost freest.

373
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:13,854
L wanna swim naked in the Danube!

374
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:16,500
Actually, it's the Vltava.

375
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:19,603
Who wants to swim naked in the Vltava?
Nobody says that.

376
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,831
In English, Vltava means
"unhealthy bacteria level."

377
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:25,475
- Yeah, right.
- Why can't you be free...

378
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:29,238
...without being naked?
- Can you help me unhook this?

379
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:32,746
- Oh, good Lord.
- Never mind. L got it.

380
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:36,148
L'm a dead man. L am officially a dead man.

381
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,948
Oh, perfect.

382
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:43,493
Anna, get here right now.

383
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:47,655
This is inappropriate behavior
in a public place.

384
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:51,165
- L'm not coming in that water.
- Like to buy that camera, please.

385
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:53,463
Why would I want to...?

386
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:01,310
- Okay.
- Thank you. There.

387
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,606
Pleasure doing business with you.

388
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:07,239
Honey? You know, let's get a quick shot.

389
00:33:07,418 --> 00:33:10,012
- Just one for the kids. Quick one.
- Smile.

390
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:12,679
All right, what do you say? Schnitzel.

391
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:19,324
L tell you what.

392
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:23,991
L bet a nice, warm bubble bath back
at the hotel would be fabulous about now.

393
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:27,899
- It would be my pleasure to escort you.
- No. L've smelled the city...

394
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:32,202
...and now I wanna taste it.
- God, I knew you were gonna say that.

395
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:34,641
You are no fun. You know that?

396
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:39,306
Oh, I'm sorry. L tend to lose my <i>joi de vivre</i>
when I'm cold, wet...

397
00:33:39,484 --> 00:33:41,452
...and starting to chafe.

398
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:44,679
It's your own fault.
Who swims fully clothed in the Danube?

399
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:47,290
We've been over this.

400
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:52,586
Where's that music coming from?

401
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:59,961
Oh, my God.

402
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:04,097
It's amazing.

403
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:18,382
L wanna see it from up there.

404
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:28,823
See, what you don't understand is,
like, this is historic for me.

405
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,403
No one ever lets me do anything
remotely dangerous, and I'm never alone.

406
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:36,540
Anyway, it's not like this
is that dangerous or anything.

407
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:39,267
Well, not unless you grab the pipe.

408
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:45,281
Oh, God.

409
00:34:51,689 --> 00:34:55,750
All right, it's probably best if you hold
your horses and let me go first...

410
00:34:55,927 --> 00:35:00,387
...because this looks to me like
it could be a little bit...

411
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:02,055
...tricky.

412
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:09,497
- We almost died. That was incredible.
- Not too dramatic, are you?

413
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:12,740
Come and have a look at this.

414
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:20,975
This is incredible.

415
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:24,952
You see that woman?
She thinks that she's just having a dream.

416
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:28,149
But she's not, and he's deceiving her.

417
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:32,763
Yeah? Well, how else can Paris get Helen
to show him how she truly feels?

418
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:35,296
It's the perfect deception.

419
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,401
So it's all right to deceive
with good reason?

420
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:39,900
Here's my theory.

421
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:43,563
Telling the truth isn't always good,
but lying isn't always bad.

422
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:47,040
If telling the truth makes someone feel bad,
lying can be good.

423
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:50,476
Good things can come from lying,
bad things from the truth...

424
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:54,846
...although sometimes telling part of the
truth is the same thing as telling a lie.

425
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:58,011
- And that's good or bad?
- I don't know.

426
00:35:58,189 --> 00:36:01,556
That part of the theory
is kind of new for me.

427
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:06,791
Anna.

428
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:20,001
Beautiful.

429
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:27,374
Isn't this romantic?

430
00:36:28,653 --> 00:36:31,679
Almost like we're on a date,
isn't it, Morales?

431
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:36,520
Yeah, right. You on a last-name basis
with most of your girlfriends?

432
00:36:38,462 --> 00:36:40,930
- Cynthia.
- Please, don't. Just don't.

433
00:36:41,098 --> 00:36:44,158
L know. L know, it didn't feel right. Sorry.

434
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:53,636
Offenbach is okay,
but I much prefer the Italian operas.

435
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:58,180
You know, tragic and romantic.

436
00:36:58,349 --> 00:36:59,976
L'm terribly sorry, milady.

437
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:03,678
All those rooftops were booked
this evening, so deal with it.

438
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,055
<i>Rigoletto</i> is my favorite.

439
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:14,426
L can totally relate to Gilda, you know,
cloistered and love-starved in the nunnery.

440
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:16,299
Come on.

441
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:21,336
Trips to Europe. Tickets to the opera.
Your life can't possibly be that bad.

442
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:24,497
L never said it was bad. It's just...

443
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:28,104
...Ionely.

444
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:34,378
And the funny thing is
I am never, ever alone.

445
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:48,494
Beer is good, isn't it?

446
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,030
L've always thought so.

447
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,702
Oh, my God.

448
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:10,710
What time is it?
L need to call my parents.

449
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:15,011
- I thought you wanted to be liberated.
- Liberated, yes. Grounded, no.

450
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:18,622
- Can I use your cell phone, please?
- Dead, I'm afraid.

451
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:21,690
Drenched with your Danube.

452
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,925
- Are these correct?
- Approximations.

453
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:27,894
- I want exact numbers. How long?
- Approximately?

454
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:29,726
- Just get them.
- Yes, sir.

455
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:33,461
- Home base. Go.
- <i>Hi. It's Anna. Can I speak to my mom?</i>

456
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:35,903
Honey, are you okay?

457
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:41,739
Yes, Mom, I'm fine. L'm totally fine,
okay? Don't worry about me.

458
00:39:42,613 --> 00:39:44,046
How's Dad?

459
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:47,050
- Anna?
- Dad? Listen to me.

460
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:50,449
You were wrong. You broke your promise.
L needed your trust.

461
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:54,717
When I saw you sent all those agents,
I went crazy, which I know wasn't right.

462
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:58,259
This is your fault,
so I'll give you the chance to apologize.

463
00:39:58,696 --> 00:40:00,561
You're right, sweetie.

464
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:03,529
L shouldn't be making promises
I don't intend to keep.

465
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:05,896
Maybe I can learn to lighten up a bit.

466
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,765
Sir.

467
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:11,101
Dad, thank you very much
for not being mad about this.

468
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:14,403
L was your age once too.
L'm just glad you're safe.

469
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:15,977
L don't know.

470
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:21,016
You know what? L'm gonna say it. You guys
have officially turned into cool parents.

471
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:23,881
- <i>Maybe you're starting to</i>...
- Anna Catherine Foster...

472
00:40:24,054 --> 00:40:26,147
...you get yourself
back here right now.

473
00:40:26,323 --> 00:40:28,848
- <i>Your little adventure is over with.</i>
- What?

474
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:32,018
See what your daughter's been up to?
L want her here now.

475
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:34,187
- What about "let freedom ring"?
- Where is she?

476
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:36,196
- Train station.
- Listen to me.

477
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:39,461
You do not, you hear me,
do not get on a train!

478
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:42,936
Are you kidding? You traced my call?

479
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:47,976
L'm your father. And the president.
L'll trace whatever I wanna trace.

480
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:51,308
Know what? L'll meet you
on the plane on Sunday. Trace this.

481
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:52,847
Anna?

482
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:56,117
Get her brought in.
Get Calder on the phone.

483
00:40:56,287 --> 00:41:00,485
- Ben. It's time for me to go now.
- So where are they picking you up?

484
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:04,526
They're not. L'm not going back.
L'm going to Berlin for the Love Parade.

485
00:41:04,695 --> 00:41:08,028
- You're not going back with your parents?
- No, they turned cool.

486
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:13,330
They told me to fly like the wind
or something. Are you gonna come?

487
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:16,701
- L'm not gonna chase you through Europe.
- I can go by myself.

488
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:18,307
- Well, you can't.
- Why not?

489
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,943
- Because.
- Because why?

490
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:23,341
Because European railway travel
can be very dangerous.

491
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:27,450
L mean, it's the preferred method of travel
for delinquents and lunatics...

492
00:41:27,618 --> 00:41:33,113
...perverts, thieves, the odd slasher now
and again. They're not properly maintained.

493
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:37,226
- The trains. The slashers are world-class.
- Yeah. Nice try, Ben. Thanks.

494
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:42,354
- Anna, just stop and think, will you?
- I don't wanna think. L wanna live.

495
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:46,196
L am so tired of knowing where I'm
gonna be every second of every day.

496
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:49,601
Prisoners have more freedom
than I do. L just...

497
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:53,334
I want real life, where real things happen.

498
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:57,072
Real life is overrated. It's a lot
of odd smells and disappointment.

499
00:41:57,248 --> 00:42:00,684
- Besides, you don't even have any money.
- I have enough.

500
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:04,810
When I researched the Love Parade,
I read about this girl from Cleveland...

501
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:08,447
...who made it on 2 bucks.
She sold her poetry along the way.

502
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:10,992
By the time she got there,
she made $ 100,000.

503
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:13,186
- Bollocks.
- I read it on the Internet.

504
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:16,629
On the Internet,
Elvis is the conductor on the Orient Express.

505
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,633
- I have this theory.
- Great, another theory. Hit me.

506
00:42:19,803 --> 00:42:22,294
If something's meant to happen, it will.

507
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:24,600
- That's a short one.
- No time. Thank you.

508
00:42:24,775 --> 00:42:26,402
- Bye.
- You're killing me.

509
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:28,204
All right, we got them.

510
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:30,706
The tracks are this way.

511
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:39,852
Hurry. Hurry. Which one is it?

512
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:42,322
- Probably the green one.
- Thank you.

513
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,996
Sir? Excuse me. Can you tell me
which train goes to Berlin?

514
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:48,125
- That one.
- Thank you.

515
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:02,075
Berlin, over there.

516
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:32,804
- What?
- Nothing.

517
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:36,776
- Why is it I find that highly unlikely?
- You have a little thing for me.

518
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:41,884
L'll stop you there. L do not have
a thing for you. Little or otherwise.

519
00:43:42,052 --> 00:43:45,180
Why did you get on the train
with me to Berlin, then?

520
00:43:48,592 --> 00:43:50,423
Okay, you know what? You're right.

521
00:43:50,594 --> 00:43:53,825
L'm attracted to exhibitionist runaways.
It's an addiction.

522
00:43:53,998 --> 00:43:58,628
L was in a program where we had to
spend time with fully clothed homebodies...

523
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:00,394
...but I've relapsed again.

524
00:44:00,571 --> 00:44:04,598
Nobody forced you to come with me.
L don't need a babysitter.

525
00:44:05,943 --> 00:44:07,433
What?

526
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:11,513
What is that smile for?
You don't think I can take care of myself?

527
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:16,085
Just because we spent the last 15 hours
together and I've rescued you 15 times...

528
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:19,347
...which, for the record,
works out at once an hour...

529
00:44:19,523 --> 00:44:23,459
...how could I think you couldn't
take care of yourself? That's ridiculous.

530
00:44:23,627 --> 00:44:26,858
Would you get over yourself?
L don't need you. L'm sorry.

531
00:44:27,031 --> 00:44:30,125
If that's what you think of me,
why don't you just leave.

532
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:35,533
Seriously. Go.
Bye-bye. L don't need you.

533
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:39,767
Why aren't you leaving?

534
00:44:40,544 --> 00:44:42,944
We're on a moving train.

535
00:44:44,982 --> 00:44:48,850
Fine. Then don't talk to me.

536
00:45:18,816 --> 00:45:21,250
<i>Not on this train. Great.</i>

537
00:45:21,418 --> 00:45:24,615
This is a Mickey Mouse assignment.
L resent it. Do you?

538
00:45:24,788 --> 00:45:26,346
- No.
- I do.

539
00:45:26,523 --> 00:45:29,356
- I just do what I'm told.
- Oh, yeah? Strip naked.

540
00:45:30,794 --> 00:45:34,958
Oh, gosh. Let me ask you something,
Weiss. Do you actually get women like this?

541
00:45:35,132 --> 00:45:39,296
L was really curious if there were actually
women out there in the world...

542
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:43,839
...who walk by the construction lunch break
which is your very personality and say:

543
00:45:44,007 --> 00:45:46,840
"Oh, yeah, please. Baby, give it to me.

544
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:51,413
Give me some of that hard hat,
right here, right now."

545
00:45:51,815 --> 00:45:53,783
There are actually women like that?

546
00:45:56,787 --> 00:45:58,220
A couple.

547
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:09,996
Hello, sleepy.

548
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:15,338
Toblerone? It's got almonds.

549
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:18,674
Oh, gosh. No, thanks.

550
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:21,706
L'm not really a nut person.

551
00:46:22,846 --> 00:46:25,110
- Don't I know you?
- No, I don't think so.

552
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:29,076
- I guess not. Scotty McGruff.
- Hi. L'm Anna.

553
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:31,380
- Oh, right.
- That's Ben.

554
00:46:31,922 --> 00:46:36,382
Hello. So are you two...?

555
00:46:36,693 --> 00:46:38,024
No.

556
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:42,697
Yeah, Ben here accidentally got
on this train when he meant to get on...

557
00:46:42,866 --> 00:46:45,664
...the knight-in-shining-armor express.

558
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:48,970
- So you're not together?
- Definitely not.

559
00:46:49,406 --> 00:46:52,239
Delight.

560
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:57,379
So, Anna, ever made slow love
on a high-speed train?

561
00:46:57,548 --> 00:47:00,244
Sorry, Romeo. Sun's in my eyes.

562
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:03,909
Mellow yellow, mate.
L was just making conversation.

563
00:47:04,087 --> 00:47:09,115
No one's looking to snag your travel buddy.
In fact, I prefer to float along alone.

564
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:13,923
- Just me, my tunes and my knapsack.
- And your sandals.

565
00:47:14,932 --> 00:47:17,492
- You sassing my Air Jesus?
- Don't listen to Ben.

566
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:20,637
- He's full of himself.
- Something you need to talk about?

567
00:47:20,804 --> 00:47:23,170
Oh, no. Ben's issues are not my problem.

568
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:27,436
He doesn't know me, because
I'm not the selfish brat he thinks I am.

569
00:47:27,611 --> 00:47:33,345
- I never said you were selfish.
- You know nothing about my life. Nothing.

570
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:36,452
- No, I suppose I don't.
- Whatever.

571
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:40,920
It doesn't matter, because when this train
stops we'll go our separate directions.

572
00:47:41,091 --> 00:47:45,926
Chilly willy, squabblers. Take a few
of these on your solo travels, then.

573
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:49,590
What are these?
<i>Six Million Dollar Man</i> stickers.

574
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:55,432
These stickers are my contribution
to the global community.

575
00:47:55,606 --> 00:47:59,269
Everyone I meet gets a handful.
Your job, post them up.

576
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:03,570
Pound one on a door, slap one on a kiosk,
place one on a postbox...

577
00:48:03,747 --> 00:48:05,977
...wherever your life may lead you.

578
00:48:06,149 --> 00:48:08,447
- And then what?
- Then, nothing.

579
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:14,089
You forget about the sticker. You move on.
One day, maybe you're down in the dregs.

580
00:48:14,258 --> 00:48:16,317
And all of a sudden, there it is.

581
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:20,994
In the corner of a window, the door of a
subway, the side of a telephone booth.

582
00:48:21,164 --> 00:48:24,827
One of the stickers. It puts a smile
on your face because you know...

583
00:48:25,002 --> 00:48:29,735
...you are not alone in the world.
We're all connected.

584
00:48:30,374 --> 00:48:32,069
Wanker.

585
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:41,412
Want some?

586
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:57,692
Hey, listen. L'm sorry
I treated you like a child.

587
00:48:57,868 --> 00:49:01,360
L was just feeling a little bit overprotective.

588
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:06,402
Thank you. That's very nice of you,
but I already have a father.

589
00:49:06,576 --> 00:49:08,066
Yeah.

590
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:12,810
God, get off me.

591
00:49:13,817 --> 00:49:15,648
Rock on, mate.

592
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:19,821
Oh, my new friends.

593
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:23,490
Who knows when the fickle finger
of fate will bring us together?

594
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:27,653
L propose a moment of silent bonding
before we reach Venice.

595
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:30,190
Before we get where?

596
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:40,599
Okay. So we got on the wrong train.
So what?

597
00:49:40,777 --> 00:49:46,374
- Let's just make the best of our misfortune.
- Our misfortune will last until tomorrow...

598
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:50,111
...because the next train
to Berlin is in the morning.

599
00:49:50,554 --> 00:49:55,491
So it's just a bit of a diversion.
Come on, enjoy. Take a picture.

600
00:50:01,198 --> 00:50:06,636
This could be one of the most
beautiful places I have ever seen.

601
00:50:06,803 --> 00:50:09,431
Be with you in two shakes.
L'm gonna make a call.

602
00:50:09,606 --> 00:50:12,439
No worries. L'll look after her.

603
00:50:17,647 --> 00:50:19,842
Sir, I got Agent Calder.

604
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:22,017
They're putting him through.

605
00:50:31,428 --> 00:50:34,727
- For God's sake. Anna?
- <i>Calder? Calder?</i>

606
00:50:35,899 --> 00:50:38,424
- We lost him.
- Great.

607
00:50:38,602 --> 00:50:42,197
- The call came from Venice.
- Weiss and Morales are halfway to Berlin.

608
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:46,900
- We can get them to Venice in a few hours.
- We can have agents in the city in minutes.

609
00:50:47,077 --> 00:50:52,310
L do not want to cause a scene. Just get
them to Venice and keep calling Calder.

610
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:54,206
Anna!

611
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:00,689
Anna!

612
00:51:09,766 --> 00:51:11,393
Ben!

613
00:51:11,935 --> 00:51:14,995
Come on. Venice awaits.
Where have you been?

614
00:51:15,172 --> 00:51:17,834
Just having a mild heart attack.

615
00:51:19,176 --> 00:51:20,973
Come on.

616
00:51:37,127 --> 00:51:39,960
Look at this!

617
00:52:11,561 --> 00:52:13,620
Check it out.

618
00:52:15,532 --> 00:52:17,397
Check it out.

619
00:52:18,568 --> 00:52:20,729
- You're so gullible.
- Yeah.

620
00:52:30,747 --> 00:52:32,544
Can I have one of those?

621
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,587
Shopping!

622
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:16,685
Marry her, Steve.

623
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:22,924
L say we hit all the tourist spots.
Anna will want to see the sights.

624
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:24,862
Whatever you say.

625
00:53:34,177 --> 00:53:36,873
- Knock it off.
- What? L'm not doing anything.

626
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:39,948
- What's the problem?
- No problem.

627
00:53:40,116 --> 00:53:41,981
No problem.

628
00:53:42,852 --> 00:53:46,344
Here in the construction lunch break
that is my very personality...

629
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:48,821
...l'm adding on a sensitivity wing.

630
00:53:48,992 --> 00:53:51,586
- I didn't really mean any of that.
- Yeah, you did.

631
00:53:53,163 --> 00:53:55,791
Well, mostly I did, yeah.

632
00:54:02,305 --> 00:54:05,103
- It looks good to me.
- No <i>gelato</i>.

633
00:54:05,275 --> 00:54:07,971
L need to refuel my belly
with some tasty yumminess.

634
00:54:08,144 --> 00:54:11,341
- L'll get it to go and meet you back here.
- Okay.

635
00:54:12,382 --> 00:54:16,580
So nice to make new friends.
Group hug.

636
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:22,191
- Sweetness.
- Ben.

637
00:54:22,692 --> 00:54:25,126
- Come on.
- Come on. Join in the hug, Ben.

638
00:54:25,295 --> 00:54:28,696
- We've got a chickie buffer here.
- L'm a chickie buffer.

639
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:33,533
Chickie buffer negates the potential
for man-touching-man discomfort.

640
00:54:33,703 --> 00:54:37,639
Ben, hug us. Please, please, please.

641
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:41,200
Quickly. Very quickly.

642
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:44,906
Delight!

643
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:56,221
L wonder where McGruff is.

644
00:54:56,393 --> 00:54:59,988
Probably off taking a bath in canal water.

645
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:05,894
Please. Come on, can you just admit for
once that you've had a little bit of fun?

646
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:08,494
Maybe a little bit of fun.

647
00:55:13,043 --> 00:55:15,534
- Very attractive.
- Very funny.

648
00:55:15,712 --> 00:55:19,978
Wonderful. Smile. Darling. Smile.

649
00:55:25,188 --> 00:55:28,624
Come on. Don't be shy. There we go.

650
00:55:28,792 --> 00:55:30,692
Oh, my God.

651
00:55:31,294 --> 00:55:32,886
Ben.

652
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:37,591
Ben, I have stickers. L have no wallet.
L think McGruff stole from me.

653
00:55:37,767 --> 00:55:41,225
- Calm down, don't make a scene.
- No, I have stickers, no money.

654
00:55:41,404 --> 00:55:44,339
L have... Stickers.

655
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:46,372
- Isn't that Anna Foster?
- Damn it.

656
00:55:46,543 --> 00:55:48,977
- I have to go.
- L'll talk to the manager...

657
00:55:49,145 --> 00:55:52,672
I can't explain now, but thank you
for everything you've done.

658
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:55,613
L have to go. L'll see you later.
Thank you.

659
00:55:55,785 --> 00:55:57,844
Here we go again.

660
00:55:59,923 --> 00:56:02,118
- There she is.
- Anna!

661
00:56:02,292 --> 00:56:03,884
Pull it over.

662
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:05,794
Anna!

663
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:43,331
This way.

664
00:57:02,552 --> 00:57:03,985
Gondola?

665
00:57:04,154 --> 00:57:05,644
- Yes.
- No.

666
00:57:06,689 --> 00:57:08,520
My first customer.

667
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:12,228
The other <i>gondolieri</i>, they put me here,
but nobody visit.

668
00:57:12,395 --> 00:57:17,526
L tell them, "Nobody come to my bridge."
They say, "Somebody will, Eugenio."

669
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:19,497
And now you are here.

670
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:22,235
We don't have any money.

671
00:57:26,225 --> 00:57:29,786
- Well, then, I'm sorry.
- But, sir, we're newlyweds.

672
00:57:29,962 --> 00:57:34,331
- Right? Right, honey?
- That's right, sweetums.

673
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:38,197
Precious, I just love it
when you call me that.

674
00:57:39,338 --> 00:57:42,102
Your love, it's beautiful.

675
00:57:44,443 --> 00:57:46,968
- No money, no ride.
- Sir, please.

676
00:57:47,146 --> 00:57:49,944
We were married
against my parents' wishes.

677
00:57:50,115 --> 00:57:54,518
- We tried to stay apart, but it was no good.
- Exactly, because I would rather die...

678
00:57:54,686 --> 00:58:00,056
...than live another day
without my lover man.

679
00:58:00,225 --> 00:58:02,659
We have nothing but we have everything.

680
00:58:02,828 --> 00:58:08,562
We've come so far
on only the currency of young love.

681
00:58:12,004 --> 00:58:15,997
If sweet stories could buy pasta,
you'd be very fat by now.

682
00:58:16,175 --> 00:58:17,836
Thank you.

683
00:58:18,143 --> 00:58:20,043
All right. Yes.

684
00:58:20,212 --> 00:58:24,273
For you, the canals are free tonight.
My first <i>cliente</i>.

685
00:58:24,450 --> 00:58:28,648
- Mama will be so proud!
- On second thought...

686
00:58:29,054 --> 00:58:31,454
After you, darling.

687
00:58:34,259 --> 00:58:38,093
Let me remember.
Where does this go?

688
00:58:38,263 --> 00:58:41,255
Just kidding!

689
00:58:41,433 --> 00:58:45,369
My first joke with my first customer.

690
00:58:56,415 --> 00:58:58,383
We did good, huh?

691
00:58:58,550 --> 00:59:02,646
L was a little worried when you went
to "the currency of young love."

692
00:59:02,821 --> 00:59:05,517
But apart from that,
you were fairly magnificent.

693
00:59:05,691 --> 00:59:08,159
- Thank you.
- Pleasure.

694
00:59:08,727 --> 00:59:12,663
You know, I just married you,
but I know nothing about you.

695
00:59:12,831 --> 00:59:15,129
There's not much to know.

696
00:59:19,438 --> 00:59:22,930
Okay. Ben Calder, 23 years old.

697
00:59:23,108 --> 00:59:29,138
Born in Wales and then moved to London
with my mother when she left my father.

698
00:59:29,948 --> 00:59:32,348
My father...

699
00:59:33,118 --> 00:59:36,747
...was always at work. Never at home.

700
00:59:37,222 --> 00:59:41,124
My mother wanted him
to make the big gesture.

701
00:59:42,494 --> 00:59:44,291
What's the big gesture?

702
00:59:45,164 --> 00:59:47,997
You know, "I'll quit for you.

703
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:53,503
L'll stay home for you, darling."

704
00:59:54,506 --> 00:59:56,337
But he didn't.

705
00:59:56,975 --> 01:00:01,071
Because... Well, people don't
really do that, do they?

706
01:00:01,813 --> 01:00:04,111
L don't know what people do.

707
01:00:28,307 --> 01:00:30,172
Thank you, Ben.

708
01:00:30,576 --> 01:00:31,873
What for?

709
01:00:32,044 --> 01:00:35,536
L couldn't have done any
of this without you.

710
01:00:36,615 --> 01:00:41,211
Seems to me you'd have
been just fine on your own.

711
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:19,989
<i>Amore</i>, such a beautiful thing.

712
01:01:23,629 --> 01:01:26,029
Take you back to your hotel now?

713
01:01:27,733 --> 01:01:31,294
Actually, we don't have a hotel.

714
01:01:34,539 --> 01:01:38,600
Newlyweds. First no money
and now no place to...

715
01:01:38,777 --> 01:01:40,677
To stay.

716
01:01:43,415 --> 01:01:45,406
You stay at my home.

717
01:01:45,584 --> 01:01:49,645
You can meet my mama.
She will be so happy.

718
01:01:54,993 --> 01:01:59,862
- Mama, please be nice.
- Why I let you buy that crazy boat?

719
01:02:00,032 --> 01:02:03,524
You were good accountant.
Now you killing me.

720
01:02:03,702 --> 01:02:07,729
- Mama, they're newlyweds.
- Newlyweds!

721
01:02:11,076 --> 01:02:15,035
- Eugenio, this is so kind of you.
- You're welcome.

722
01:02:20,252 --> 01:02:26,680
Tonight you are family.
You must stay and celebrate.

723
01:02:26,858 --> 01:02:30,385
You will sleep in Eugenio's room.
It will bring him luck.

724
01:02:30,562 --> 01:02:32,530
Oh, no, that's...

725
01:02:33,665 --> 01:02:35,895
Change the sheets.

726
01:02:36,401 --> 01:02:39,859
L want you to try some of my <i>grappa</i>.

727
01:02:41,306 --> 01:02:42,671
Tell me your names.

728
01:02:42,841 --> 01:02:45,810
Well, I'm Ben. And this is...

729
01:02:47,679 --> 01:02:49,271
...Anna.

730
01:02:51,149 --> 01:02:55,950
<i>Make no mistake. America is committed</i>
<i>to backing leaders and nations...</i>

731
01:02:56,121 --> 01:03:01,684
<i>... that are paving the hard but rewarding</i>
<i>path toward political and economic reform.</i>

732
01:03:02,828 --> 01:03:06,457
Okay. Let's just check with the local police.

733
01:03:07,866 --> 01:03:11,461
To answer your question, no.
L don't get women that way.

734
01:03:11,636 --> 01:03:14,264
Haven't actually had a girlfriend since...

735
01:03:14,439 --> 01:03:17,840
Let's just say that women
stopped beating down my door...

736
01:03:18,009 --> 01:03:21,877
...about the same time the bangs
stopped covering the receding hair line.

737
01:03:26,752 --> 01:03:30,415
Stop overcompensating.
You're a good-Iooking...

738
01:03:31,690 --> 01:03:33,954
You look fine. Some girls like a bald head.

739
01:03:34,126 --> 01:03:37,186
- L'm not bald yet.
- L'm just saying. You should embrace it.

740
01:03:37,362 --> 01:03:42,493
Maybe you could cut it really short.
Some girls like that. They think it's sexy.

741
01:04:02,287 --> 01:04:03,879
So...

742
01:04:04,890 --> 01:04:08,053
I'm gonna sleep on the floor...

743
01:04:08,226 --> 01:04:12,094
...which means that
you can have the bed to yourself.

744
01:04:12,264 --> 01:04:15,665
You don't have to do that.
There's plenty of room here for both...

745
01:04:15,834 --> 01:04:18,769
No, no. It's fine. L prefer the floor...

746
01:04:18,937 --> 01:04:21,531
...because it's just a bit...

747
01:04:23,041 --> 01:04:27,171
...Iower. Which I like. You know, so...

748
01:04:27,345 --> 01:04:28,778
Yeah.

749
01:04:39,090 --> 01:04:42,150
Oh, come on. Don't be shy.
It's our wedding night.

750
01:04:44,029 --> 01:04:46,224
- Ben?
- Night, now.

751
01:05:02,714 --> 01:05:06,047
- Where are you going?
- Anna, go to bed.

752
01:05:06,218 --> 01:05:08,243
L'm trying to.

753
01:05:09,921 --> 01:05:11,752
Over there.

754
01:05:13,925 --> 01:05:15,756
But, Ben, we...

755
01:05:16,561 --> 01:05:18,426
- We kissed...
- I understand that.

756
01:05:18,864 --> 01:05:22,163
And I liked it. L like you.
Will you stop walking away from me?

757
01:05:22,334 --> 01:05:25,963
- Anna!
- You don't need to protect me.

758
01:05:29,774 --> 01:05:33,733
- I know what I'm doing.
- No, you don't...

759
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:37,207
Can you please stop taking
your clothes off around me?

760
01:05:37,382 --> 01:05:39,316
- What's wrong with you?
- Anna...

761
01:05:39,484 --> 01:05:43,853
...what happened on the gondola
was me trying to hide you, nothing else.

762
01:05:44,022 --> 01:05:46,081
- That was a real kiss.
- No, it wasn't.

763
01:05:46,258 --> 01:05:48,226
- I don't believe you.
- It's the truth.

764
01:05:48,393 --> 01:05:52,227
L told you. We're just two people traveling
in the same direction.

765
01:05:57,068 --> 01:05:59,127
So you didn't...

766
01:05:59,905 --> 01:06:03,272
...feel anything?

767
01:06:03,608 --> 01:06:07,601
No. L didn't feel anything.

768
01:06:09,347 --> 01:06:13,681
So can you please just get into bed?

769
01:06:29,301 --> 01:06:32,361
Naked virgin safely in bed.

770
01:07:00,899 --> 01:07:03,834
<i>Yes, sir. L understand, Mr. President.</i>

771
01:07:04,002 --> 01:07:07,233
Don't worry, we're gonna find her.

772
01:07:07,572 --> 01:07:09,062
Yes, sir.

773
01:07:09,541 --> 01:07:13,033
Did I mention what a ridiculous idea
this was to begin with, sir?

774
01:07:13,211 --> 01:07:15,372
One of your stupidest.

775
01:07:15,547 --> 01:07:17,742
He hung up before any of that.

776
01:07:25,890 --> 01:07:27,289
You look at this view?

777
01:07:27,959 --> 01:07:29,449
Is Anna in it?

778
01:07:29,628 --> 01:07:31,095
No.

779
01:07:31,262 --> 01:07:33,127
Let's keep moving.

780
01:07:33,298 --> 01:07:36,961
L'm not leaving this spot till you
take a moment to appreciate this.

781
01:07:42,407 --> 01:07:45,342
You know, it's not enough
just to be a beauty, Morales.

782
01:07:45,510 --> 01:07:48,411
You have to be able
to appreciate beauty too.

783
01:07:49,848 --> 01:07:52,078
Nice to have you back, Weiss.

784
01:07:59,758 --> 01:08:03,125
L'd like to take a moment
to give thanks to Anna...

785
01:08:03,294 --> 01:08:07,162
...who ran from her parents, jumped
a train to Venice instead of Berlin...

786
01:08:07,332 --> 01:08:11,894
...thus giving us the opportunity
to witness this phenomenal sight.

787
01:08:12,070 --> 01:08:14,095
- Amen.
- Finished?

788
01:08:17,976 --> 01:08:20,342
Oh, come on.

789
01:08:30,955 --> 01:08:32,820
It's hip-hop Hebrew.

790
01:08:36,795 --> 01:08:38,820
You had a good night?

791
01:08:39,698 --> 01:08:41,666
Yes, great. Thank you.

792
01:08:41,866 --> 01:08:44,960
Thank you so much for your hospitality.

793
01:08:45,403 --> 01:08:50,841
But you were very quiet.
The walls is like paper, but I hear nothing.

794
01:08:51,009 --> 01:08:53,273
That's just because
he's repelled by me.

795
01:08:55,847 --> 01:08:57,405
But it's not true.

796
01:08:57,582 --> 01:09:00,745
Tell her she's a beautiful woman.

797
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:03,644
You're a beautiful woman.

798
01:09:05,056 --> 01:09:06,717
And kiss her.

799
01:09:06,891 --> 01:09:11,919
Come on. You want a happy marriage,
you gotta kiss her every day.

800
01:09:14,933 --> 01:09:17,094
It's okay. We'll work it out.

801
01:09:20,772 --> 01:09:23,332
Mama, where are the car keys?

802
01:09:23,508 --> 01:09:27,035
You driving with Eugenio?
Better kiss her now.

803
01:09:39,090 --> 01:09:42,924
- The bike, the bike, the bike!
- Idiot!

804
01:09:48,733 --> 01:09:50,394
Thank you, darling.

805
01:09:51,136 --> 01:09:56,972
Eugenio, thank you so much for everything.
L wish I had something else to offer you.

806
01:09:57,709 --> 01:10:01,873
<i>Six Million Dollar Man</i>.
It's a wonderful gift.

807
01:10:05,884 --> 01:10:09,752
A beautiful couple.
Take care of each other.

808
01:10:20,198 --> 01:10:23,224
- Hey.
- Don't touch me.

809
01:10:37,916 --> 01:10:39,406
English, <i>por favor.</i>

810
01:10:40,285 --> 01:10:41,547
That's Spanish, Weiss.

811
01:10:42,887 --> 01:10:45,754
<i>Allora</i>, about Eugenio.

812
01:10:46,424 --> 01:10:49,825
He was a good accountant.
Why he buy the stupid boat...?

813
01:10:50,228 --> 01:10:53,061
He was last seen with these two people.

814
01:11:00,305 --> 01:11:02,432
The newlyweds.

815
01:11:05,343 --> 01:11:10,246
L say we don't tell him until we have
something really good to go with it.

816
01:11:10,415 --> 01:11:15,614
We find her and say, "Here's your daughter.
Sorry, Mr. President. She's married."

817
01:11:15,787 --> 01:11:20,690
God, this is bad. It was bad before,
but now it's beyond bad.

818
01:11:20,859 --> 01:11:24,989
Yep. This is pretty much
as bad as it gets.

819
01:11:25,997 --> 01:11:27,794
Now you touch me?

820
01:11:39,510 --> 01:11:43,276
- They just crossed the Austrian border.
- Weiss and Morales are en route.

821
01:11:43,448 --> 01:11:45,507
No contact with Calder since yesterday.

822
01:11:45,683 --> 01:11:48,811
Enough. L want a full contingent
at that Love Parade.

823
01:11:48,987 --> 01:11:53,151
- Jim, how could you let this happen?
- I don't know. It happened.

824
01:11:53,925 --> 01:11:55,950
Sir? There's one more thing.

825
01:11:57,161 --> 01:11:58,685
What else?

826
01:12:02,133 --> 01:12:04,294
We think they're married.

827
01:12:21,853 --> 01:12:26,688
So, what is it? Do you have a girlfriend?
L mean, is that who you called yesterday?

828
01:12:27,325 --> 01:12:28,917
No, no girlfriend.

829
01:12:32,730 --> 01:12:37,793
Okay, well, if you didn't like girls,
you could've just said something to me.

830
01:12:37,969 --> 01:12:40,335
Hey, listen, I like girls.

831
01:12:43,808 --> 01:12:47,244
Oh, okay. So you're just
not attracted to this one.

832
01:12:47,412 --> 01:12:52,315
No, that's okay. This whole time I felt alone
because I never had any opportunities...

833
01:12:52,483 --> 01:12:56,613
...because I never had privacy, but thanks
for proving me wrong. L needed that.

834
01:12:56,788 --> 01:12:59,279
Anna, believe me,
this is not about you.

835
01:13:00,825 --> 01:13:03,919
Romance is simply not...

836
01:13:04,095 --> 01:13:06,086
...a feasible option for me right now.

837
01:13:06,264 --> 01:13:11,429
Oh, God. Kill me now. L can't even attract
some guy who says stupid things like:

838
01:13:11,602 --> 01:13:14,400
"Romance is not a feasible option"?

839
01:13:15,940 --> 01:13:18,636
You know what?
The joke is on you, my friend.

840
01:13:18,810 --> 01:13:22,246
L was just kidding last night.
L would never go through with it.

841
01:13:22,413 --> 01:13:23,675
Of course you wouldn't.

842
01:13:27,986 --> 01:13:30,147
No! Stop!

843
01:13:31,055 --> 01:13:32,454
Anna, don't.

844
01:13:33,358 --> 01:13:34,825
Anna. Anna.

845
01:13:35,994 --> 01:13:37,461
Oh, come on.

846
01:13:40,465 --> 01:13:41,932
Bye-bye.

847
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:57,609
Unbelievable.

848
01:14:50,535 --> 01:14:51,934
Good luck.

849
01:15:07,518 --> 01:15:09,008
Shit.

850
01:15:19,397 --> 01:15:23,766
Hi, I just... <i>Guten tag</i>. That's the extent
of my German. L really need the bike.

851
01:16:01,038 --> 01:16:04,405
He's gonna jump.
No, no, no! Somebody stop him!

852
01:16:04,575 --> 01:16:06,133
No, don't do it!

853
01:16:06,310 --> 01:16:08,642
Bungee!

854
01:16:17,955 --> 01:16:21,652
Very good. Very good.

855
01:16:37,909 --> 01:16:41,572
You found us on the Internet?
Jumpinggermans. Com?

856
01:16:41,746 --> 01:16:43,077
No.

857
01:16:47,718 --> 01:16:50,346
- McGruff?
- To life!

858
01:16:50,755 --> 01:16:52,347
McGruff.

859
01:16:53,257 --> 01:16:56,021
- Look. My reasons were noble.
- I trusted you.

860
01:16:56,194 --> 01:16:59,254
L needed the scratch. What can I say?
Please forgive.

861
01:16:59,430 --> 01:17:01,625
- Three, two, one, bungee!
- Bungee!

862
01:17:25,590 --> 01:17:27,615
Need to put this tighter.

863
01:17:37,401 --> 01:17:39,426
Oh, no, wait, wait, wait!

864
01:17:41,906 --> 01:17:44,704
Are you crazy?
What are you doing?

865
01:17:44,875 --> 01:17:47,742
Get away from me.
L'm jumping, and you can't stop me.

866
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:51,814
Bloody hell.

867
01:18:01,892 --> 01:18:03,359
If you're scared, why do it?

868
01:18:05,563 --> 01:18:10,967
Because the things you're scared of are
usually the most worthwhile. Just a theory.

869
01:18:13,571 --> 01:18:16,335
You know what?
Actually, my dad taught me that.

870
01:18:20,077 --> 01:18:21,942
Hold tight.

871
01:18:32,390 --> 01:18:35,450
- God!
- Oh, my Lord.

872
01:18:47,271 --> 01:18:48,568
Hi.

873
01:18:49,573 --> 01:18:51,768
Hello. Here we go.

874
01:18:59,917 --> 01:19:02,442
L can't believe we just did that.

875
01:19:09,660 --> 01:19:11,560
Check that out.

876
01:19:13,898 --> 01:19:16,958
Holy crap.

877
01:19:33,784 --> 01:19:35,979
Yeah, you'd better stay out there.

878
01:19:36,354 --> 01:19:38,515
You know, we needed that money.

879
01:19:38,689 --> 01:19:40,247
You guys got it all wrong.

880
01:19:40,424 --> 01:19:44,417
L gave most of it back.
Besides, that money was for love.

881
01:19:44,595 --> 01:19:49,225
L've been traipsing over this stinking
continent looking for a girl I've never met.

882
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:52,631
We made goo-goo eyes
from, like, 30 meters.

883
01:19:52,803 --> 01:19:58,571
But our eyes locked. We connected,
which is next to impossible in this world.

884
01:19:58,743 --> 01:20:03,442
You know that. You can't let a feeling
like that pass you by.

885
01:20:07,518 --> 01:20:10,043
You'd hug him all over again,
wouldn't you?

886
01:20:14,425 --> 01:20:17,189
L'm all right. L'm all right.

887
01:20:29,407 --> 01:20:32,672
Just so you know,
that's incredibly hot.

888
01:20:33,611 --> 01:20:35,203
Oh, I'm sorry.

889
01:20:50,694 --> 01:20:52,855
Oh, hi, Gus Gus.

890
01:20:53,030 --> 01:20:57,364
Gus Gus. So much of you
they had to name you twice.

891
01:20:57,535 --> 01:21:00,436
L thought you might need this.

892
01:21:01,772 --> 01:21:04,332
- Thanks.
- So...

893
01:21:07,678 --> 01:21:09,043
Yes?

894
01:21:10,781 --> 01:21:12,339
So...

895
01:21:13,017 --> 01:21:14,382
No.

896
01:21:19,056 --> 01:21:23,891
For a girl who claims to be terminally alone,
you sure do get a lot of offers.

897
01:21:24,929 --> 01:21:26,590
And rejections.

898
01:21:30,734 --> 01:21:32,099
You're right.

899
01:21:34,171 --> 01:21:38,267
You know what?
L'm tired of living my life just in theory.

900
01:21:38,943 --> 01:21:42,242
- I think I'm gonna go talk to Gus Gus.
- Oh, come on.

901
01:21:43,447 --> 01:21:46,848
You can't seriously be attracted
to that walking...

902
01:21:47,418 --> 01:21:48,885
...AIp.

903
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:51,547
L don't know.

904
01:21:51,722 --> 01:21:54,623
L can see myself in the mountains,
raising children...

905
01:21:54,792 --> 01:21:59,058
...little Hans Hans and Gunther Gunther.

906
01:21:59,730 --> 01:22:01,129
Anna, don't.

907
01:22:03,167 --> 01:22:06,603
- Why not?
- Because I don't trust him.

908
01:22:07,505 --> 01:22:11,236
- I don't think he's good enough for you.
- Yeah, right.

909
01:22:11,408 --> 01:22:15,469
Because up until the last three days
I was perfectly content with my life...

910
01:22:15,646 --> 01:22:18,444
...of solitary adventure
and then you came along...

911
01:22:18,616 --> 01:22:23,110
Well, you came along and those
two things seemed mutually exclusive.

912
01:22:23,287 --> 01:22:24,652
Ben.

913
01:22:25,256 --> 01:22:30,592
Can you ever just say
what you really feel?

914
01:22:35,566 --> 01:22:37,261
Okay, all right.

915
01:22:37,434 --> 01:22:39,061
Because...

916
01:22:39,503 --> 01:22:41,528
...l'm jealous as hell.

917
01:22:41,705 --> 01:22:45,436
L'd hate to see you with Gus Gus.
L'd hate to see you with another man.

918
01:22:45,609 --> 01:22:49,443
Not only did I adore kissing you
in Venice...

919
01:22:49,947 --> 01:22:51,812
...but also because...

920
01:22:52,650 --> 01:22:57,383
...l'm so un-bloody-hinged
just being near you.

921
01:23:18,175 --> 01:23:19,836
L guess you fixed it, huh?

922
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:31,015
Anna.

923
01:23:50,941 --> 01:23:52,203
Calder.

924
01:23:52,376 --> 01:23:58,508
- Where the hell have you been?
- Listen, Weiss. She's here and she's safe.

925
01:23:58,682 --> 01:24:01,617
We've been trying to reach you.
Your orders changed.

926
01:24:01,785 --> 01:24:03,184
What're you talking about?

927
01:24:03,354 --> 01:24:07,620
Your assignment has been over since
you jumped on that train to Venice.

928
01:24:09,326 --> 01:24:10,884
- What?
- Ben?

929
01:24:13,497 --> 01:24:14,896
L'll be right there.

930
01:24:15,699 --> 01:24:17,030
Okay.

931
01:24:18,869 --> 01:24:20,131
L've gotta go, mate.

932
01:24:20,371 --> 01:24:22,669
Bring her in immediately.
We have a plan.

933
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:24,933
L promised I'd take her to the parade.

934
01:24:25,109 --> 01:24:29,443
- Calder, listen to me. Listen.
- <i>I've got really bad reception here. L gotta</i>...

935
01:24:29,613 --> 01:24:31,342
Who was that?

936
01:24:33,517 --> 01:24:36,918
Just some friends from Prague
wondering where I am.

937
01:24:47,765 --> 01:24:52,464
- He's gonna take her to the parade.
- Well, I guess we're going to the parade.

938
01:24:56,940 --> 01:24:58,271
What? What?

939
01:25:01,345 --> 01:25:03,006
You did this for me, right?

940
01:25:03,614 --> 01:25:06,777
- This? No, I didn't do it for you. What?
- Really?

941
01:25:06,950 --> 01:25:09,783
No, it was... I got tired of styling it,
you know.

942
01:25:11,188 --> 01:25:12,849
Okay.

943
01:25:15,492 --> 01:25:17,585
Because it's kind of sexy.

944
01:25:27,905 --> 01:25:31,966
- L'm sorry. Saw an opening, so I went for it.
- Sorry. Yeah.

945
01:25:44,688 --> 01:25:47,384
When we get Anna,
I'm gonna put you in that tower.

946
01:25:47,558 --> 01:25:49,958
You've been a very bad
super-secret agent.

947
01:25:56,633 --> 01:25:58,498
You've got cute morning hair.

948
01:25:58,669 --> 01:26:00,796
You've got cute everything.

949
01:26:07,010 --> 01:26:08,910
Hey, McGruff.

950
01:26:11,682 --> 01:26:14,708
Wanna go to the Love Parade,
see if mystery girl's there?

951
01:26:14,885 --> 01:26:16,113
Rock on.

952
01:26:16,620 --> 01:26:18,952
Sir. We just heard from Weiss.

953
01:26:19,123 --> 01:26:21,956
Anna and Calder are going
to the Berlin Love Parade.

954
01:26:22,126 --> 01:26:24,026
- Get to Berlin.
- Yes, sir.

955
01:27:09,106 --> 01:27:10,733
Anna!

956
01:27:11,975 --> 01:27:16,878
Hey! Oh, my God!
Gabrielle, I never thought I'd find you.

957
01:27:17,915 --> 01:27:20,440
You made it. L was so worried.
Where were you?

958
01:27:20,617 --> 01:27:24,576
You have no idea what
it took us to get here.

959
01:27:27,057 --> 01:27:30,686
- Do I know you?
- My name is Scott Thomas McGruff.

960
01:27:30,861 --> 01:27:34,991
L know how to make a woman feel like
she's wearing laundry fresh out the dryer.

961
01:27:35,365 --> 01:27:37,196
Gabrielle Le Clerc.

962
01:27:38,068 --> 01:27:41,902
- He okay?
- Yeah, yeah. Just hold on to your wallet.

963
01:27:43,006 --> 01:27:44,405
Nice to meet you.

964
01:27:47,244 --> 01:27:50,645
- McGruff, what about your mystery girl?
- What girl?

965
01:27:53,317 --> 01:27:57,777
- Okay, you are glowing. Sex?
- No.

966
01:27:58,555 --> 01:28:00,182
Love.

967
01:28:09,700 --> 01:28:12,794
Weiss, I'll need at least an hour
before you move in.

968
01:28:12,970 --> 01:28:15,996
The president is not waiting an hour
for his daughter.

969
01:28:16,173 --> 01:28:18,698
- It's important to her.
- I don't care.

970
01:28:18,876 --> 01:28:20,901
L do, damn it.
So stick to the plan.

971
01:28:21,078 --> 01:28:23,603
L'll have her by the Victory Column
in one hour.

972
01:28:23,780 --> 01:28:27,147
Then this whole thing will be over
and she'll be all yours.

973
01:28:27,451 --> 01:28:30,716
What is going on? Who the hell...?

974
01:28:30,888 --> 01:28:32,321
No, Anna. Just...

975
01:28:32,489 --> 01:28:33,888
No!

976
01:28:37,895 --> 01:28:40,489
You see a Victory Column
somewhere around here?

977
01:29:11,762 --> 01:29:13,423
Anna!

978
01:29:14,698 --> 01:29:17,064
- Let me explain.
- Get away from me.

979
01:29:17,234 --> 01:29:19,702
- L'm Secret Service.
- That is such bullshit.

980
01:29:19,870 --> 01:29:22,270
L was outside the consulate
when you ran.

981
01:29:22,439 --> 01:29:25,340
L was in contact with Weiss and Morales
the whole time.

982
01:29:29,479 --> 01:29:32,915
- Oh, my God.
- Your father gave you controlled freedom.

983
01:29:33,083 --> 01:29:34,573
So I was his safety net.

984
01:29:38,221 --> 01:29:39,813
And yours.

985
01:29:43,126 --> 01:29:46,994
- You lied to me?
- I know. L'm sorry. Jesus, I'm sorry.

986
01:29:47,164 --> 01:29:50,691
- But something happened along the way.
- No kidding, you asshole.

987
01:29:50,867 --> 01:29:55,031
- You gotta believe me.
- How can I believe anything at this point?

988
01:29:55,205 --> 01:29:59,369
That's what I'm telling you.
L didn't plan for it to happen, but it did.

989
01:30:01,478 --> 01:30:02,809
L fell in love with you.

990
01:30:10,721 --> 01:30:13,451
You can go to hell.
You and my father both.

991
01:30:17,894 --> 01:30:19,259
Anna.

992
01:30:42,486 --> 01:30:45,853
<i>This is Harper.</i>
<i>We're flying over the Love Parade now.</i>

993
01:30:56,333 --> 01:30:59,461
Excuse me.

994
01:31:15,218 --> 01:31:17,345
My grandmother throws
better than you.

995
01:31:17,521 --> 01:31:21,013
<i>Sprechen sie</i> English, punk?
Yeah, that's what I thought.

996
01:31:22,692 --> 01:31:24,353
Hey, where are you guys going?

997
01:31:26,196 --> 01:31:27,458
Hey, watch it.

998
01:31:28,398 --> 01:31:30,161
Hey, hey, hey.
Look who that is.

999
01:31:31,301 --> 01:31:34,031
- No. No way.
- It's Anna Foster.

1000
01:31:34,204 --> 01:31:35,796
- It's Anna Foster, guys.
- Hey.

1001
01:31:35,972 --> 01:31:38,770
- No. No, I'm not Anna, okay?
- Where you going?

1002
01:31:38,942 --> 01:31:43,208
- Come on, Anna. Come on, precious.
- Excuse me. You've got the wrong person.

1003
01:31:43,380 --> 01:31:45,371
You're a bit far from the White House.

1004
01:31:45,549 --> 01:31:47,710
- What you doing here?
- I need to go.

1005
01:31:47,918 --> 01:31:50,478
- How about a date, babe?
- Don't touch me!

1006
01:31:50,654 --> 01:31:54,317
- Wanna party? You're far from home.
- Leave me alone. Just stop!

1007
01:31:55,025 --> 01:31:56,788
- Come on, Anna.
- Good God.

1008
01:31:56,960 --> 01:32:00,726
- Hey, that's enough. Let's go.
- Come on. Get out of my way. Who're you?

1009
01:32:01,131 --> 01:32:04,897
- Anna, let me help you get out of here.
- Thank you so much.

1010
01:32:05,068 --> 01:32:07,866
Hey, you want some real fun?
Come with us, sexy.

1011
01:32:08,038 --> 01:32:11,064
- Get away from me.
- Come with us. She's a princess.

1012
01:32:37,033 --> 01:32:38,864
Anna, it's okay.

1013
01:32:39,569 --> 01:32:41,537
You're safe.

1014
01:32:52,749 --> 01:32:55,684
- You all right?
- Come on, Anna. Let's go home.

1015
01:34:42,459 --> 01:34:46,953
Together we've been able to move
this humanitarian effort forward.

1016
01:34:47,130 --> 01:34:49,724
This has taken the cooperation
of all our allies.

1017
01:34:49,899 --> 01:34:56,134
But we are still confident
that these programs will benefit...

1018
01:35:14,424 --> 01:35:16,255
How's your heart?

1019
01:35:17,294 --> 01:35:18,761
It's...

1020
01:35:19,596 --> 01:35:21,461
...a little bit broken.

1021
01:35:29,105 --> 01:35:31,471
Oh, Mom.

1022
01:35:46,156 --> 01:35:49,990
Something about a college campus.
Isn't there, Morales? You know?

1023
01:35:50,193 --> 01:35:53,629
- What do you mean?
- I mean, you know, the falling leaves...

1024
01:35:53,797 --> 01:35:56,857
...the promise of youth,
the smell of curricula.

1025
01:36:00,503 --> 01:36:04,234
L'm thinking we probably
gotta get new partners.

1026
01:36:06,743 --> 01:36:09,075
- L'm thinking I'm okay with that.
- Yeah?

1027
01:36:09,245 --> 01:36:10,906
- That so?
- Yeah.

1028
01:36:11,081 --> 01:36:14,608
- As long as your partner's an old fat guy.
- I love old fat guys.

1029
01:36:14,784 --> 01:36:16,979
- You do too. You do.
- I do.

1030
01:36:17,153 --> 01:36:19,018
- What?
- You're so silly.

1031
01:36:19,189 --> 01:36:20,451
You think?

1032
01:36:27,130 --> 01:36:29,428
You guys are in love, huh?

1033
01:36:30,300 --> 01:36:34,760
- Yeah, I guess so.
- It's amazing. L'm at this great school...

1034
01:36:34,938 --> 01:36:37,133
...and there's not one course on love.

1035
01:36:37,307 --> 01:36:41,368
You can't learn about love in a classroom.
The dorms, maybe.

1036
01:36:41,544 --> 01:36:44,012
What? You can't learn about it
in a classroom.

1037
01:36:44,180 --> 01:36:46,273
Love is not always that easy, Anna.

1038
01:36:46,750 --> 01:36:49,184
Nothing worth getting ever is.

1039
01:36:50,353 --> 01:36:53,254
Have you tried to get chili fries
on this campus?

1040
01:36:53,423 --> 01:36:58,326
They sell chili. Oh, yes, and they sell the
fries. But they cannot put the two together.

1041
01:36:58,495 --> 01:37:00,963
You got a building
with engineering students...

1042
01:37:01,297 --> 01:37:02,787
...but they...
- Just kiss me.

1043
01:37:02,966 --> 01:37:04,331
Okay.

1044
01:37:13,410 --> 01:37:15,970
Anna. Welcome home.

1045
01:37:16,146 --> 01:37:18,580
- Thank you. Happy holidays.
- Thanks. And you.

1046
01:37:18,748 --> 01:37:21,512
Hey, Phil. Is he busy?

1047
01:37:21,684 --> 01:37:23,584
Not for you.

1048
01:37:23,820 --> 01:37:25,651
- New shades?
- Yeah.

1049
01:37:25,922 --> 01:37:29,016
- Nice. Hey, Harper. New suit?
- No.

1050
01:37:32,128 --> 01:37:37,896
Hey, Buddy! Hi, Buddy.
How have you been? Hey.

1051
01:37:38,067 --> 01:37:40,661
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hey, Daddy.

1052
01:37:44,707 --> 01:37:46,971
You look...

1053
01:37:47,911 --> 01:37:49,538
You look collegiate.

1054
01:37:49,712 --> 01:37:51,441
Thanks.

1055
01:37:53,383 --> 01:37:55,783
- How's school?
- It's good. Yeah.

1056
01:37:56,085 --> 01:37:59,919
- Good. Am I in any textbooks yet?
- No, not yet.

1057
01:38:01,524 --> 01:38:04,357
L hope you're taking some time
to have some fun.

1058
01:38:04,527 --> 01:38:06,722
- You do?
- Yeah.

1059
01:38:06,896 --> 01:38:08,523
Since when?

1060
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:13,665
- Anna.
- No, Dad. You know what?

1061
01:38:13,837 --> 01:38:18,206
L know why you were so protective.
You didn't want me to get hurt...

1062
01:38:18,374 --> 01:38:23,038
...and you were right. L needed protection
because people can't be trusted.

1063
01:38:23,980 --> 01:38:25,311
L have learned my lesson.

1064
01:38:26,049 --> 01:38:28,313
L didn't want you to learn that lesson.

1065
01:38:29,185 --> 01:38:30,743
Too late.

1066
01:38:35,792 --> 01:38:37,384
God.

1067
01:38:37,894 --> 01:38:40,624
L love this house at Christmas.

1068
01:38:42,365 --> 01:38:44,094
We miss you around here, Anna.

1069
01:38:55,445 --> 01:39:00,007
So have you given any more thought
to that exchange study program at Oxford?

1070
01:39:00,183 --> 01:39:02,515
No, not really. Why?

1071
01:39:02,819 --> 01:39:05,253
Just always thought
it was a great opportunity.

1072
01:39:06,055 --> 01:39:07,716
Yeah, I guess.

1073
01:39:09,592 --> 01:39:14,052
Okay, well, I'll leave you to it
and I will see you at dinner.

1074
01:39:17,333 --> 01:39:21,269
- Do I smell cigar smoke? Dad.
- No.

1075
01:39:21,437 --> 01:39:22,904
- Come on.
- I don't think so.

1076
01:39:23,072 --> 01:39:26,405
- That's the story you're sticking with?
- Don't tell your mother.

1077
01:39:32,715 --> 01:39:35,047
You remember Agent Calder?

1078
01:39:35,818 --> 01:39:37,183
Ben.

1079
01:39:37,654 --> 01:39:40,885
- Dad.
- He's not an agent anymore. He quit.

1080
01:39:43,159 --> 01:39:46,617
- Really?
- Yeah, he's living in London now.

1081
01:39:46,930 --> 01:39:49,797
Maybe he found something
he's more passionate about.

1082
01:39:49,966 --> 01:39:51,297
Just a theory.

1083
01:39:52,502 --> 01:39:53,901
Yeah.

1084
01:39:57,640 --> 01:39:59,540
Thought you'd wanna know.

1085
01:40:02,545 --> 01:40:03,910
Okay.

1086
01:40:47,523 --> 01:40:50,583
Charlie, kill dimmer four and light one.

1087
01:40:52,895 --> 01:40:54,294
Yeah.

1088
01:41:00,169 --> 01:41:02,637
Hey, did you see who just walked in?

1089
01:41:06,075 --> 01:41:10,034
Have you seen who just walked in?
That's the president's daughter.

1090
01:41:15,752 --> 01:41:17,583
There's Anna Foster.

1091
01:41:38,741 --> 01:41:40,174
What are you doing here?

1092
01:41:40,343 --> 01:41:44,677
L'm a big Puccini groupie.

1093
01:41:46,249 --> 01:41:48,843
L'm studying for a semester at Oxford.

1094
01:41:53,356 --> 01:41:55,256
L came to find you.

1095
01:41:56,325 --> 01:41:58,725
- You did?
- Yeah.

1096
01:41:59,762 --> 01:42:02,196
L'm making the big gesture.

1097
01:42:04,600 --> 01:42:06,067
How did you know I was here?

1098
01:42:07,770 --> 01:42:09,795
L have connections.

1099
01:42:11,607 --> 01:42:13,768
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

1100
01:42:14,844 --> 01:42:17,711
- So you got a little thing for me, huh?
- No.

1101
01:42:19,816 --> 01:42:21,443
Big thing.

1102
01:42:35,832 --> 01:42:39,393
- Lf I kiss you, do you think they'll shoot me?
- No.

1103
01:42:39,902 --> 01:42:41,836
But I will if you don't.

1104
01:43:03,226 --> 01:43:07,560
- Please, can you help me get out of here?
- Yeah, why not?

1105
01:50:33,609 --> 01:50:35,600
