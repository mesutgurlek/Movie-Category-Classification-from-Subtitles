1
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:05,589
Yes?

2
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,174
- Hey.
- Hello.

3
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:09,927
- You're new.
- I started yesterday.

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,428
- What's your name?
- Leisal.

5
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:14,640
Okay. I'm Brigitte. This is Gretel.

6
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:18,894
- Emily and Richard are expecting us.
- I'm sorry.

7
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,312
Please come in.

8
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:27,611
Can I get you a drink?

9
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:31,448
I can get it.
Why don't you go hide in the kitchen?

10
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:33,325
Really? Thank you.

11
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:36,119
- What is going on?
- I don't know.

12
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:38,664
I think George and Martha
are joining us for dinner.

13
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:42,543
I didn't know my every conversation
had to be reported. I stand corrected.

14
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:45,087
I have been the co-chair
of the Starlight Foundation...

15
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,130
- for the last eight years.
- I know this.

16
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:50,425
The Black and White Ball is the main
fundraising event of the season.

17
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:52,970
- It's one year.
- The co-chair cannot miss...

18
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,055
- the main fundraising event.
- Why?

19
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:57,516
- Won't the chair be there?
- Is this a joke to you?

20
00:00:57,599 --> 00:01:00,143
I have too many things
to take care of at work.

21
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:02,980
I don't have time for frivolous parties.

22
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,731
Frivolous parties?

23
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:09,236
Where are you going? Come back here.

24
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,780
- This is bad.
- I know. I wish we had popcorn.

25
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:13,031
- Mom.
- Incoming.

26
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,409
'The Hartford Zoological silent auction...

27
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:18,036
'the Mark Twain House
Restoration Fund luncheon...

28
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,289
'the Harriet Beecher Stowe
Literacy Auction.'

29
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:22,082
I can read those myself.

30
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:25,627
This is the fourth event
you have turned down on our behalf.

31
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:28,088
I am on the board
of all of those foundations.

32
00:01:28,172 --> 00:01:31,049
- How does that make me look?
- Like your husband is busy...

33
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:34,636
- and has a lot of responsibility.
- I have responsibilities, too.

34
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,015
I understand that your social engagements
are important.

35
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,975
They're not just social engagements.

36
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:43,103
Anything at which you serve tea
is a social engagement.

37
00:01:43,187 --> 00:01:45,898
I am getting a tape recorder
so you can hear how pompous...

38
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:47,733
and condescending you sound.

39
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,777
I don't want you to take my word for it.
I might be delirious...

40
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:53,113
- from all that tea I've been drinking.
- Stop.

41
00:01:53,197 --> 00:01:54,615
Maybe we should leave.

42
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:56,700
Are you kidding?
We have dinner theater here.

43
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,827
But Grandma and Grandpa are in a fight.

44
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:01,038
- Yeah.
- They wouldn't want us to see it.

45
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,248
We stumbled in here
completely innocently.

46
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,667
We came for dinner, as usual,
per their request.

47
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:08,629
We didn't know we'd see The Lion King
without the puppet heads.

48
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:10,339
Get that thing out of my face.

49
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:12,883
- Say the tea thing again.
- You're acting like a child.

50
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:16,220
Turn around when you talk.
I'm not sure this microphone is good.

51
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:17,346
What?

52
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,807
Brava! Encore!

53
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:24,269
Does Terrence McNally know
about you two? Get me the phone!

54
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:25,330
It sucks. I know it sucks.
Just tell me it sucks.

55
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:28,834
It's great.

56
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:30,586
- No, it's not.
- It's an 'A.'

57
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:31,795
- Don't lie.
- A-plus.

58
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,964
- You're my mom.
- Is anything higher than A-plus?

59
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,633
- You have to say that.
- An A-plus with a crown and a wand.

60
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,385
This is not how you raise a child.

61
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,804
You don't send them out
with a false sense of pride.

62
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:43,849
Because in the real world,
no one will coddle you.

63
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:46,268
I'd rather know now
if I'll be working at CNN...

64
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:49,354
or carrying a basket around its offices
with sandwiches.

65
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:50,981
- Rory.
- Yeah?

66
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,441
Lt's great.

67
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,776
- Really?
- Really, really.

68
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:57,487
- Thank you.
- Coffee.

69
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:02,034
- What do you want? Eggs, toast, combo?
- What's the rush?

70
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:05,662
I'm swamped this morning.
I was supposed to have help, but I don't.

71
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:07,831
So order now, or I'm bringing you both...

72
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,958
an egg-white omelet
with steamed spinach.

73
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:11,210
- Pancakes.
- French toast.

74
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:12,628
Thank you.

75
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:14,588
You were supposed to be down here...

76
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,424
- What the hell is that?
- What?

77
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:19,885
- That.
- That is a shirt.

78
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:21,261
- Change.
- What?

79
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:24,097
- Go upstairs and change your shirt.
- I like this shirt.

80
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:26,517
- How can you like it?
- It brings out my eyes.

81
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,228
Part of the deal of you staying here
is that you work here.

82
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,730
When you work here,
you will wear proper work attire.

83
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,440
That is not proper work attire.

84
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:36,693
Go upstairs and change into something
that won't scare my customers.

85
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,946
Whatever you say, Uncle Luke.

86
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,031
- Gross T-shirt.
- Yeah.

87
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,741
- Good band.
- Yeah.

88
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,326
Thank you.

89
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,497
- Another new one, Emily?
- Yes.

90
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,707
The last one
only made it through one evening.

91
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,252
- Thoroughly nervous creature.
- What do you do to them?

92
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,754
The usual. 'Clean this, cook that...

93
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:59,758
- 'sacrifice a virgin on your way out.'
- The things you say.

94
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,803
We could have done with some of that
at the ball the other night.

95
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:03,887
Was it dull?

96
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:06,932
I felt like my shoes
were going out of style as I sat there.

97
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:09,268
- What a shame.
- It wasn't all dull.

98
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:11,770
- Are we forgetting Truly Bishop?
- That's right.

99
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,397
What about Truly Bishop?

100
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,441
- She and Eugene split up last month.
- What?

101
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:20,737
You knew about that.
They had this huge fight at the...

102
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:23,824
That's right.
You missed the Schaffers' cocktail party.

103
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,993
They broke up
at the Schaffers' cocktail party?

104
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:27,953
He has another family in Salisbury.

105
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:31,081
- No.
- She's 26, with a 2-year-old.

106
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:34,126
- How did Truly find out?
- The little tart sent her a letter.

107
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:36,753
- Oh, my God.
- So Truly confronted Eugene...

108
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:39,173
after consuming a bottle and a half
of Cristal...

109
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:42,885
and he said he was going to leave her
and marry the Salisbury concubine.

110
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:45,387
- What did she do?
- Threw an ice sculpture at his head.

111
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,763
I can't believe I missed that.

112
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,641
- You've missed everything lately.
- Where have you been?

113
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:52,686
- Is everything all right?
- Yes, it's just Richard.

114
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,813
He hasn't been hanging out in Salisbury?

115
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:58,025
No. He's been swamped at work,
night and day, weekends.

116
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:00,777
Like he was the only person
who worked at that company.

117
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:02,571
Plus, he hasn't been feeling very well.

118
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:05,449
His back and knees, very bad knees.

119
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,494
Rory, what a nice surprise.

120
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:12,039
- Sorry to butt in like this.
- Nonsense.

121
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:16,126
Come and meet my friends. I'd like you
to meet my granddaughter Rory.

122
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,170
- Hello, Rory.
- Nice to meet you.

123
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:20,672
My goodness, what a pretty girl you are.

124
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:23,467
- She looks just like Lorelai, doesn't she?
- The eyes.

125
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,511
- The nose.
- Walk around, sweetie.

126
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:27,721
- Leave the girl alone.
- I want to see the walk.

127
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,474
- Lorelai had such a specific walk.
- Fast.

128
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:33,227
- That was it.
- Sit. Would you like some tea?

129
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,313
No, I came to pick up a book
that Grandpa was supposed to leave.

130
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,316
- Check his study, it might be on his desk.
- Thanks.

131
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,569
Your granddaughter is just lovely.
How old is she?

132
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:45,280
- Sixteen.
- That's a nice age.

133
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:49,117
- Have you thought about her debut?
- No, not yet.

134
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:52,829
The Daughters of the Daughters of
the American Revolution Debutante Ball...

135
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:55,582
- is next week.
- It is? I hadn't realized.

136
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,960
Why don't you present Rory there?

137
00:06:58,043 --> 00:07:00,337
I don't know. Isn't it a little late?

138
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,382
Please. For Emily Gilmore
I'm sure they'll bend the rules.

139
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:04,550
You have to.

140
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:07,219
With a girl like that,
you'll be the hit of the ball.

141
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:09,263
She'd definitely be the prettiest one.

142
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:12,474
- Except for Katie Hethington.
- No. Didn't you hear?

143
00:07:12,558 --> 00:07:15,227
Katie fell off her horse.
There's a scab on her face.

144
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:19,147
Well, then, if Katie Hethington
has a scab on her face...

145
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:21,608
Rory will definitely be
the prettiest one there.

146
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:23,902
It'll be your crowning moment.

147
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,529
I found it.

148
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:35,455
- I'm coming out.
- Out of what?

149
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:37,708
- Out into society.
- What are you talking about?

150
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,878
- I went to Grandma's house after school.
- Right away, bad.

151
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,922
Her DAR friends are all there,
they're talking about...

152
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:46,425
- this Debutante Ball that's being thrown.
- Oh, no.

153
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:50,179
When I got back from Grandpa's office,
they invited me onto the patio.

154
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:53,724
- Tell me you did not go onto the patio.
- I went onto the patio.

155
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,894
That's like accepting the position
as the drummer in Spinal Tap.

156
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,104
Grandma told me how important it is...

157
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:01,732
for a person to be properly presented
to society.

158
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:04,234
And how every young girl
dreams of this day.

159
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:05,736
- And how there are flowers.
- Lord.

160
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:06,987
- And music.
- Please.

161
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,989
- And cake.
- The cake's actually good.

162
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:12,701
Before I knew it, Grandma brought out
your old dress, I tried it on...

163
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:15,162
- What are you doing?
- Getting you out of this.

164
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:18,457
My mother is great
at getting someone to agree...

165
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:21,627
to something that in another universe
they would never consider.

166
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,379
I am convinced she had something
to do with Lily Tomlin...

167
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:27,508
- doing that movie with John Travolta.
- I'm doing this.

168
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:28,634
Why?

169
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:31,637
You should've seen
Grandma's face when she asked me.

170
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,514
- It's really important to her.
- But...

171
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:37,726
If it's important to her and not important
to me, then why shouldn't I do it?

172
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:40,562
Do you know
what a coming-out party says?

173
00:08:40,646 --> 00:08:42,731
- It says, 'I'm a woman now.'
- No, it says:

174
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:46,360
'Hi, I'm Rory. I'm of good breeding
and marriageable age.

175
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:48,820
'I will now parade around in front of...

176
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:51,698
'young men of similarly good breeding
and marriageable age...

177
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:54,493
- 'so they can take a good look at me.'
- You're exaggerating.

178
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:57,329
It's like animals being up for bid
at the county fair...

179
00:08:57,371 --> 00:09:00,249
- except sheep don't wear hoop skirts.
- I promised.

180
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:04,753
- But you don't have to be a part of it.
- Lf you want to do it, I'll help.

181
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,630
It's just weird.

182
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:11,260
This is all the stuff I ran away from.
I just assumed you'd be running with me.

183
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:15,305
I would, but I heard debutantes don't run,
something about the heels.

184
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:18,642
All right, then.
If you're sure, where do we start?

185
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:24,064
Let's see, you have a dress.
You need a dowry, I guess.

186
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:27,109
There you go. And you'll need shoes...

187
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:31,029
hose, gloves, some mice, a dog,
a pumpkin.

188
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,033
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

189
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:39,705
It says your father is supposed
to present you at the ceremony.

190
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,333
Whatever. I can get someone else to do it.

191
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:45,919
- Grandpa, probably. Or Taylor.
- Okay.

192
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:49,131
Or the cable guy, he looked friendly
last week. He may have a tux.

193
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:52,217
- Hand me the phone.
- I was kidding about the cable guy.

194
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:54,344
- What are you doing?
- There are many things...

195
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:56,555
that should weird you out
about coming out...

196
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:59,808
but inviting your father
shouldn't be one of them.

197
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:01,894
The number you have dialed has changed.

198
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:03,061
Gum wrapper.

199
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:06,356
- He's not going to come.
- You don't know until you ask.

200
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:10,736
- Mom.
- Look, we call, we ask.

201
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:14,615
There's no harm. Trust me,
the cable guy's not going anywhere.

202
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,910
- Hello?
- Hi!

203
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:20,245
- Where the hell are you?
- Boston.

204
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:21,830
- Boston?
- Yeah.

205
00:10:21,914 --> 00:10:24,458
Baked beans, cream pie,
tea party, strangler.

206
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,043
- That Boston.
- And you?

207
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,294
- Me?
- Where are you?

208
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:28,754
- Helsinki.
- Really?

209
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:31,465
I got the girl band together.
After opening stateside...

210
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:34,801
we headed across the Atlantic,
now we're huge with the Nordic set.

211
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:36,929
Good to hear you.
We haven't talked in a while.

212
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:38,430
You could have called, too.

213
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,807
Or does your phone only receive calls?

214
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:42,601
I figured you had a lot going on...

215
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:45,896
what with the engagement
and the canceling of the engagement.

216
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:48,190
- How's that going?
- Still canceled.

217
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:49,399
- You okay?
- Good.

218
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,568
I'm even better
when I'm not talking about it.

219
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:54,613
- Moving on, then.
- I have some shocking news.

220
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:57,032
- Rory's coming out.
- Out of what?

221
00:10:57,115 --> 00:11:00,035
Coming out: White dresses,
gloves, curtsies.

222
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:01,620
- Stop it.
- I swear to God.

223
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:03,038
You're letting her do it?

224
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:06,583
I wasn't about to let her use
my method of getting out of it.

225
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:07,835
This is crazy.

226
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:10,754
She's doing it as a favor to my mom.
Can't talk her out of it.

227
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:13,340
Did you tell her about
Barbara Hutton, Doris Duke?

228
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:16,093
Yes, and she's perfectly willing
to marry Cary Grant...

229
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:19,137
get offed by her crazy butler,
and start designing blue jeans...

230
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,639
as soon as the ball ends.

231
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:22,391
If that's what she wants.

232
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:24,810
Now comes the reason for my phone call.

233
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:26,812
All your regular 976 numbers were busy.

234
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:28,981
I know this is totally not your thing...

235
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:32,609
but as you will remember, part of
the coming-out process involves...

236
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:36,113
the girls being escorted
around the dance floor by their dads.

237
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:39,950
Now, I know you would rather
sit through Endless Love...

238
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,953
than ever be a part of this scene again...

239
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:47,541
but this is important to your daughter,
and she's never asked you for anything.

240
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:51,378
Although no one's keeping track,
it seems your constant non-presence...

241
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:55,132
in her life, and your lack of showing up
when you say you're going to...

242
00:11:55,174 --> 00:11:57,009
or calling when you say you're going to...

243
00:11:57,092 --> 00:11:59,595
or basically doing anything
when you say you will...

244
00:11:59,678 --> 00:12:02,681
would tend to indicate
that you owe her big time.

245
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:05,976
Now, before you say no,
I want you to take a minute...

246
00:12:06,268 --> 00:12:09,313
and remember you have
a great daughter who needs you.

247
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:13,066
She has a mother who will hunt you down
like a half-price Kate Spade purse...

248
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,652
- if you disappoint her.
- Okay. I'm there.

249
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:20,032
You mean the Daughters of the American
Revolution Annual Debutante ball?

250
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:21,116
Yes.

251
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,869
- Don't make this promise if you can't.
- I wouldn't miss it.

252
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:26,497
- It's next weekend.
- I'll clear my schedule.

253
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,874
- You swear?
- Wait, next weekend?

254
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:31,001
- Christopher.
- I'm kidding.

255
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,836
I will definitely be there.

256
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,340
In exchange, I'll refrain from saying
the 10 things that came to mind...

257
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:38,133
for making fun of your schedule.

258
00:12:38,217 --> 00:12:39,968
- Thanks.
- Bye.

259
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:44,223
Hey, little debbie,
your dad is definitely gonna be there.

260
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:45,516
- You're kidding.
- No.

261
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:49,728
He's gonna walk you down the stairs,
turn you in a circle, watch you curtsy...

262
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:53,065
and announce that Rory Gilmore
is officially open for business.

263
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:55,817
- He definitely said 'definitely'?
- Definitely.

264
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:59,738
- So there's a 50-50 chance?
- He sounded pretty sure. I'd say 60-40.

265
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:08,247
No, Mom, I'm sure one crinoline
will be plenty.

266
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,915
No, she doesn't.

267
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,459
I'm sure she doesn't.

268
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:14,545
In what scenario
would I have bought Rory...

269
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:16,755
elbow-length kidskin gloves?

270
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,883
Sorry, in what scenario on my planet...

271
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:23,303
would I have bought Rory
elbow-length kidskin gloves?

272
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:25,931
- So?
- So what?

273
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:27,057
Lt's good, huh?

274
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,101
Lt's the Rock and Roll
Hall of Fame Induction.

275
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,854
- Doesn't Neil Young look cool?
- I guess.

276
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:33,814
If you'll notice, he's wearing a tux.

277
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:37,401
He looks cool because he's Neil Young,
not because he's wearing a tux.

278
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:40,487
I don't have to ask her, Mom,
'cause I know the answer.

279
00:13:40,571 --> 00:13:42,948
I know the answer, Mom.

280
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:46,660
Yeah. No. Well, I don't have to ask her...

281
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:48,954
Hold on.

282
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:55,294
Would you like Grandma's hairstylist
to come and set your hair before the ball?

283
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:58,839
I did not coach her.
Go back to talking about gloves.

284
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:02,384
- You're gonna look great in a tux.
- Tails.

285
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:05,554
- What?
- According to this it says that:

286
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:07,639
'All escorts must be properly attired...

287
00:14:07,723 --> 00:14:10,851
'in black tails, white cummerbunds,
and white gloves.'

288
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:13,020
- What?
- I'm sure the gloves are optional.

289
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:14,938
Not according to this.

290
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:18,192
- Tails? Gloves?
- Remember Neil Young.

291
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:21,111
Remember that you love me.

292
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:25,741
Remember that I'll be watching
BattleBots with you for a month.

293
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:28,785
Show me Neil Young again.

294
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:31,914
Dad!

295
00:14:36,502 --> 00:14:40,464
Whoa! Hold it. A lady never runs out
to meet a gentleman caller...

296
00:14:40,506 --> 00:14:41,632
who hasn't been announced.

297
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:43,759
We haven't tamed my wild ways yet.

298
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:46,512
- Thank God I'm here now.
- I missed you.

299
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:48,222
- Me, too.
- Hey.

300
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,516
- What is this?
- What?

301
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:53,644
- God, where did this come from?
- What happened to your bike?

302
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:56,021
Crazy game of key exchange
at the car wash.

303
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:57,981
- This is a car.
- Yes, it is.

304
00:14:58,065 --> 00:15:01,276
It has four wheels and a roof
and air bags...

305
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,530
and seat belts, and my God,
it smells like a forest.

306
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:09,159
Well, I needed a little more space.
Had something big to haul.

307
00:15:10,244 --> 00:15:12,454
I believe this belongs to you.

308
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:15,332
- The Compact Oxford English Dictionary.
- I'd promised you.

309
00:15:15,374 --> 00:15:16,959
- Sorry it took so long.
- That's okay.

310
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:18,710
This is the new edition.

311
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:21,171
The old one doesn't have
the word 'jiggy' in it.

312
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:23,715
Thank you. I love it.
I'll look things up right now.

313
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:24,800
Wait!

314
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:26,718
- Thanks.
- Go.

315
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:30,347
- That was really great of you.
- Thank you.

316
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,891
- Back to mocking my car?
- Yeah. A Volvo sedan.

317
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:34,935
- Are you kidding?
- This is a great car.

318
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:37,771
- For driving to bingo.
- It just seemed like time.

319
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:39,982
I couldn't keep showing up for work
on my bike.

320
00:15:40,065 --> 00:15:41,483
- Work?
- You've heard of it?

321
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,235
Yes, but I didn't think you had.

322
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:46,822
Took a while, I kept getting it mixed up
with 'nap,' but I figured it out.

323
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:49,241
So you bought a car and got a job.

324
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:51,076
Actually, job, then car.

325
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:53,620
- 'Cause it's more responsible that way.
- Exactly.

326
00:15:53,704 --> 00:15:55,706
Wow! So tell me about the job.

327
00:15:55,789 --> 00:16:00,043
I show up every day, drink bad coffee,
exchange lame pleasantries...

328
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:03,589
with Linda from marketing, and after
two weeks, they give me a paycheck.

329
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:05,966
- It's a pretty cool system.
- You're serious?

330
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:08,051
You know how us working types are.
Get in.

331
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:10,721
I'm not supposed to take rides
with strangers.

332
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:12,764
- Trust me.
- Yes, but only if...

333
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:16,393
you promise we won't go over
25 miles an hour on the motorway.

334
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:20,397
Oh, my God.

335
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:22,816
George Lucas wishes
he had this sound system.

336
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,986
Got Alpine head units, two subs,
and two 12s.

337
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:30,324
- In exchange, no passenger-side air bag.
- So the old Christopher still lives.

338
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:33,619
Could you please attenuate
the cacophony out here?

339
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:37,122
Turn down the music.

340
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:40,792
Next time, instead of a dictionary,
just slip her a crisp $20.

341
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:41,960
Deal.

342
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,798
Twelve pairs of pantyhose.

343
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,635
It's going to be a long night.
She's bound to have a run.

344
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,303
Twelve pairs.

345
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:55,390
There's the presentation, the circle,
the curtsy, the fan dance.

346
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:59,269
Mom, there'd have to be a 12-kilometer
run and a jujitsu demonstration...

347
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:01,355
for her to go through
12 pairs of pantyhose.

348
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:03,440
Does it really hurt to be prepared?

349
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:06,318
- No, it doesn't hurt to be prepared.
- Thank you.

350
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,820
The good news is, now she is prepared...

351
00:17:08,904 --> 00:17:12,324
for her high-school graduation,
her college graduation, her marriage...

352
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:15,911
three to five anniversaries, a hostess gig,
and jury duty...

353
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:19,289
- especially if she's sequestered.
- You make me tired.

354
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:21,583
Richard, I didn't know you were home.

355
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:24,044
Yes, well, we learn something every day.

356
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:26,129
- You didn't have to work?
- I am working.

357
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:28,549
Guess how many pairs of pantyhose
we bought?

358
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:30,175
I'd rather not, if you don't mind.

359
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:33,512
I got you some beautiful new cuff links
for this weekend.

360
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:34,805
I already have cuff links.

361
00:17:34,847 --> 00:17:38,684
- But these have bulldogs on them. Look.
- I'll look at them later.

362
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:39,852
All right, fine.

363
00:17:39,935 --> 00:17:42,437
Remember to get your tux
from the cleaners tomorrow.

364
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:44,982
- No time.
- It's around the corner from your office.

365
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:46,900
- I have to go in early tomorrow.
- Go now.

366
00:17:46,984 --> 00:17:48,652
- I am busy now.
- Doing what?

367
00:17:48,694 --> 00:17:51,530
I am not going to qualify my time
with you.

368
00:17:51,655 --> 00:17:53,657
I am not going to pick up my tuxedo.

369
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:56,910
You planned this ridiculous affair,
you pick up my tuxedo.

370
00:17:56,994 --> 00:17:58,745
Or I simply don't have to go.

371
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:01,707
Either one of these options
is fine with me.

372
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:12,259
Hey, Mom, I might be reading
too much into this...

373
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:14,428
but is something going on
between you and Dad?

374
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:15,679
What are you talking about?

375
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:18,849
He just seems a little less jolly than usual.

376
00:18:18,891 --> 00:18:20,767
- He's just busy.
- He seems upset.

377
00:18:20,851 --> 00:18:22,436
- He's not.
- You seem upset.

378
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:25,230
- I'm not. We're both fine.
- Okay. My mistake.

379
00:18:25,564 --> 00:18:27,816
I'd better go pick up his tux.

380
00:18:31,737 --> 00:18:33,864
Keep counting in your heads.

381
00:18:33,906 --> 00:18:36,700
Look each other in the eye.
Dean, are you leading?

382
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:39,244
- I have no idea.
- Okay, stop.

383
00:18:39,745 --> 00:18:42,873
Remember, one of the most important
things in ballroom dancing...

384
00:18:42,915 --> 00:18:44,249
is to remember to spot.

385
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:47,586
Otherwise, you're gonna get dizzy.
So what you want to do...

386
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:50,172
is pick out something to focus on.

387
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:52,925
I usually like to find a lonely seaman.

388
00:18:53,217 --> 00:18:56,803
Then when turning, whip your head
around and find your spot again.

389
00:18:56,887 --> 00:18:59,306
Hello, sailor.

390
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:02,392
Now you try it.

391
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:05,687
You got to be kidding me.

392
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:08,357
You can do it
without the 'hello, sailor' part.

393
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,776
- BattleBots.
- For the rest of your life.

394
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:12,861
Now take it from the top.

395
00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:20,953
Hey. You guys are really improving.

396
00:19:21,036 --> 00:19:24,122
- Now you're actually facing each other.
- Anyone need a break?

397
00:19:24,206 --> 00:19:28,627
Okay, take five, but don't sit down
because your muscles will get cold.

398
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:33,257
- So how's it going?
- Actually, I'm not very good.

399
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,051
Which is really holding me back,
because I'm a natural.

400
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:38,595
Maybe you need a glittery glove
and a freaky face.

401
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:42,057
Miss Patty thought Dean would
get hurt, and she made me sit and watch.

402
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,934
Nobody puts baby in the corner.

403
00:19:43,976 --> 00:19:47,145
It's not your fault. Ballroom dancing
is a wonderfully sexist thing.

404
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:51,483
Any woman can do it. All she needs
is a strong male lead. No offence.

405
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:55,362
- Well, almost any woman can do it.
- I wasn't ready.

406
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:57,447
- I want a do over.
- Fine.

407
00:19:58,574 --> 00:19:59,908
May I have this dance?

408
00:19:59,992 --> 00:20:03,537
I don't know. Do you have a trust fund?
Always make sure.

409
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:42,451
Okay, I'm adopted.

410
00:20:42,534 --> 00:20:44,411
I'm never gonna be able to do that.

411
00:20:44,495 --> 00:20:46,163
You guys just need some practice.

412
00:20:46,205 --> 00:20:50,417
Listen to your father, Rory.
Your adorable father.

413
00:20:50,501 --> 00:20:53,629
Let's get you out of here
before you become Patty's next husband.

414
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:55,130
See you guys later.

415
00:20:56,131 --> 00:20:59,468
- Bye, Patty.
- The way you toy with me.

416
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:03,180
Did you know you still knew
how to do that?

417
00:21:03,222 --> 00:21:05,182
I wish I didn't. Imagine what we could do...

418
00:21:05,224 --> 00:21:08,227
if we freed up the brain space
it holds on the Viennese waltz.

419
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:12,356
It's right up there between Brady Bunch
reruns and the lyrics to Rapture.

420
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:15,901
I got to say,
this isn't like the chai lattes in Boston.

421
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:20,072
Expecting Luke to make a chai anything
was completely insane.

422
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:22,991
I'm pretty sure he just threw
a cinnamon stick in some tea.

423
00:21:23,075 --> 00:21:24,993
I'm pretty sure it's not a cinnamon stick.

424
00:21:25,077 --> 00:21:26,954
Okay, throwing this out now.

425
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:29,623
So, chai latte, when did that happen?

426
00:21:29,915 --> 00:21:32,751
I don't know.
Everyone at work drinks them.

427
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:36,755
Since you still haven't told me
what exactly it is that you do...

428
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:40,384
I'm gonna go with yoga instructor
or chiropractor.

429
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:43,554
It's actually interesting.
I'm working for this firm that helps...

430
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:47,266
overblown tech companies scale back
and stay afloat in leaner times.

431
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:51,228
- I'm sorry, what's the interesting part?
- We dress like superheroes when we do it.

432
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,354
Nice.

433
00:21:52,604 --> 00:21:54,898
How long will you be able
to keep this going?

434
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,067
I'm happy there,
I'd say at least till Tuesday.

435
00:21:57,109 --> 00:21:59,653
- So, long-term.
- You know, it's weird.

436
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:03,323
I hated the idea of having to be
somewhere at a specific time each day...

437
00:22:03,407 --> 00:22:06,034
but it turns out I like the stability.

438
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:07,911
- Really?
- Yeah.

439
00:22:07,953 --> 00:22:12,499
I like that at the end of the day, I feel like
I've done something, earned something.

440
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:14,835
I think that's really great.

441
00:22:14,918 --> 00:22:18,005
Only took me 10 years
and several failed business ventures...

442
00:22:18,088 --> 00:22:20,424
- to figure out what I wanted.
- Which is?

443
00:22:20,465 --> 00:22:24,428
Not my parents' life.
Something you figured out at 16.

444
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:28,015
Actually, six months,
but I just couldn't vocalize it yet.

445
00:22:28,098 --> 00:22:30,809
You knew what you wanted,
you went out and got it.

446
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:33,103
I was always a little jealous of you.

447
00:22:33,145 --> 00:22:35,272
You seem to be catching up.

448
00:22:37,149 --> 00:22:38,400
We did good.

449
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:42,362
Yeah. Well, I did good.

450
00:22:42,863 --> 00:22:45,949
The fact that she can't follow lead
is all you.

451
00:22:50,996 --> 00:22:55,709
See, only a lady can gracefully walk
around a room with a book on her head...

452
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:57,503
while eating kung pao chicken.

453
00:22:57,544 --> 00:23:00,047
A great lady can spit the peanuts
into the container...

454
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,423
- without anyone noticing.
- Wow.

455
00:23:01,507 --> 00:23:03,467
Well, don't be intimidated.

456
00:23:03,509 --> 00:23:05,594
You have to practice a lot
to get to my level.

457
00:23:05,677 --> 00:23:08,055
- Anyone want the last egg roll?
- No.

458
00:23:08,138 --> 00:23:09,515
Where are you going?

459
00:23:09,556 --> 00:23:11,725
- To get the egg roll.
- You're getting it yourself?

460
00:23:11,808 --> 00:23:12,976
- Yes.
- No!

461
00:23:13,018 --> 00:23:16,355
Ladies never get their egg rolls,
they never get their own anything.

462
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:18,357
- Not even their own ideas.
- Oh, boy.

463
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:21,276
They sit helplessly and wait
for some young, strong man...

464
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,694
to come by and assist them.

465
00:23:22,778 --> 00:23:24,696
They don't step in puddles
or over puddles.

466
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:27,741
They can't even look at puddles.
They need to be blindfolded...

467
00:23:27,825 --> 00:23:29,827
and thrown in a sack
and carried over puddles.

468
00:23:29,868 --> 00:23:32,871
Isn't there a moratorium on how long
ladies should talk?

469
00:23:32,913 --> 00:23:36,291
No. Repeat after me,
'I am completely helpless.'

470
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:38,669
You put the left side
through the back loop...

471
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:41,380
and you tug a little bit on both sides...

472
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:44,883
and you, my friend,
might just be mistaken for a gentleman.

473
00:23:44,925 --> 00:23:46,343
Or a waiter.

474
00:23:47,052 --> 00:23:48,929
How do you know how to do this?

475
00:23:49,012 --> 00:23:51,390
Seventeen cotillions,
a dozen debutante balls...

476
00:23:51,473 --> 00:23:54,852
and a scarring experiment with
the Children of the American Revolution.

477
00:23:54,893 --> 00:23:56,395
Where you wear only the bow tie.

478
00:23:56,436 --> 00:24:01,024
A good idea on conception, but the sudden
snowstorm instantly dampened the effect.

479
00:24:01,066 --> 00:24:04,486
Hey, do you think it's cool
when Neil Young wears a tux?

480
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:07,155
Yeah, of course, but it's Neil Young.

481
00:24:08,073 --> 00:24:11,410
All right, I should get going.
I'll see you at 3:00.

482
00:24:12,744 --> 00:24:13,871
Wait.

483
00:24:14,288 --> 00:24:15,747
- What's this?
- Your gloves.

484
00:24:15,831 --> 00:24:19,251
- I thought you were kidding.
- No. Ladies never kid.

485
00:24:21,503 --> 00:24:22,838
- Bye.
- Bye.

486
00:24:23,172 --> 00:24:25,215
- I'm going to bed, too.
- Do you need help?

487
00:24:25,257 --> 00:24:27,342
- No.
- Wrong. The correct answer is yes.

488
00:24:27,426 --> 00:24:30,470
- Ladies need help with everything.
- Good night.

489
00:24:32,306 --> 00:24:35,100
I don't know how
she's ever gonna make it in society.

490
00:24:35,142 --> 00:24:38,687
At this rate, she's gonna get a job
and only marry once.

491
00:24:38,979 --> 00:24:41,106
- Calling your mom again?
- I don't get it.

492
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:44,443
Every five minutes last week,
she called to check on shoe fittings...

493
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:47,613
and curtsy progress, and if I talked Rory
into putting her hair up.

494
00:24:47,696 --> 00:24:49,114
Then tonight, nothing.

495
00:24:49,156 --> 00:24:52,201
I'm sure they have a lot of getting ready
to do for themselves.

496
00:24:52,284 --> 00:24:54,536
She's been acting so weird lately.

497
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:57,039
They're fighting, openly fighting.

498
00:24:57,456 --> 00:25:00,584
They've never done that before.
I'm not sure what to do about it.

499
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:02,753
Move to California. That's what I do.

500
00:25:02,836 --> 00:25:05,130
My father
doesn't even want to go tomorrow.

501
00:25:05,172 --> 00:25:08,800
His perfect angel granddaughter
is being presented to society...

502
00:25:08,884 --> 00:25:11,011
in front of his friends and colleagues.

503
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:14,556
Something he never got to do
with his bad, loser, evil daughter.

504
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,808
Maybe you should talk to them.

505
00:25:16,892 --> 00:25:20,187
I'm sorry, was that me?
I must have had an aneurysm.

506
00:25:20,521 --> 00:25:22,481
Nothing more I can do tonight.

507
00:25:22,564 --> 00:25:24,733
I'm going to bed.
Want me to turn off the lights?

508
00:25:24,816 --> 00:25:28,362
Actually, I have to stay up
and do a little work tonight.

509
00:25:28,779 --> 00:25:32,449
I'm sorry. I keep forgetting that
that's not a joke anymore.

510
00:25:32,491 --> 00:25:33,826
Good night.

511
00:25:40,374 --> 00:25:42,125
This place is huge.

512
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:46,129
- Do I have to walk down those stairs?
- I'm afraid so.

513
00:25:46,171 --> 00:25:50,008
Unless you want to make a memorable
entrance and slide down the banister...

514
00:25:50,092 --> 00:25:52,052
which I totally encourage, by the way.

515
00:25:52,135 --> 00:25:53,929
- You are...
- Lorelai Gilmore.

516
00:25:54,012 --> 00:25:55,889
...late.
- Sorry. My fault.

517
00:25:56,473 --> 00:25:57,808
Took me a while to get pretty.

518
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:01,228
Not all of us are 16 anymore,
you know what I mean? No.

519
00:26:01,311 --> 00:26:04,481
You are to head up the stairs.
The preparation room is on the right.

520
00:26:04,523 --> 00:26:07,693
Look for the toxic cloud
of Chanel and Final Net.

521
00:26:13,907 --> 00:26:16,827
Hang your dress there.
Put your makeup on over there.

522
00:26:16,869 --> 00:26:19,204
You'll have to make do
with a non-lighted mirror.

523
00:26:19,246 --> 00:26:22,291
The lighted ones went to the girls
that were here before dawn.

524
00:26:22,374 --> 00:26:23,792
Listen up, ladies!

525
00:26:23,876 --> 00:26:27,546
Everyone must be beautiful
and ready to go by 7:30.

526
00:26:32,384 --> 00:26:36,388
- Can't believe we have an hour and a half.
- I'm never gonna be ready in time.

527
00:26:36,471 --> 00:26:39,016
God knows when the swelling on my nose
is gonna go down.

528
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:42,728
I had to go and inherit
my father's nose. I'm Libby.

529
00:26:43,562 --> 00:26:47,107
Which one should I wear?
I thought all month and I cannot decide.

530
00:26:47,191 --> 00:26:49,067
Well, that's a tough one.

531
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:51,695
I know. This is red-red,
and this is orange-red.

532
00:26:51,737 --> 00:26:54,698
The wrong one,
and I will look like a hooker or a teacher.

533
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,991
That's a lot of pressure.

534
00:26:56,074 --> 00:26:57,910
The two minutes you stand on the stairs...

535
00:26:57,993 --> 00:27:00,746
will determine your social status
for the rest of your life.

536
00:27:00,787 --> 00:27:03,123
Wow. What if you trip?

537
00:27:04,249 --> 00:27:07,628
I mean, not that you would.
You wouldn't. I might.

538
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:10,923
Probably will, actually.
Could be a Cirque du Soleil kind of night.

539
00:27:11,006 --> 00:27:13,884
You should not even joke
about stuff like that.

540
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,386
There's a head under there.

541
00:27:18,055 --> 00:27:20,015
You are a wonderful man.

542
00:27:20,098 --> 00:27:22,976
I have a feeling
we're gonna be very close tonight.

543
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:28,440
- Mom, you're here.
- Where should I be, Spain?

544
00:27:28,482 --> 00:27:31,276
I tried calling you all night last night.

545
00:27:31,443 --> 00:27:34,738
- I was very busy.
- And then we got here before you.

546
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,616
- What is your point?
- Nothing. It's just weird.

547
00:27:37,658 --> 00:27:40,285
Well, I'm here now,
so it's not weird anymore.

548
00:27:40,369 --> 00:27:42,871
Look at these flowers. Baby's breath.

549
00:27:42,955 --> 00:27:44,832
What is this, County General?

550
00:27:44,915 --> 00:27:46,875
You look very nice. I like your dress.

551
00:27:46,959 --> 00:27:50,420
Cotton tablecloths, folding chairs.
It's not supposed to be like this.

552
00:27:50,504 --> 00:27:53,799
- In my day, people sat in real chairs.
- Mom, what's the matter?

553
00:27:53,882 --> 00:27:56,802
I wanted my granddaughter
to be presented to society...

554
00:27:56,885 --> 00:28:00,013
in a beautiful, elegant ballroom,
not a Shakey's.

555
00:28:00,097 --> 00:28:02,724
The room is beautiful.
You're being too critical.

556
00:28:02,808 --> 00:28:05,519
There's Nan. I'm going
to have a little talk with her...

557
00:28:05,602 --> 00:28:07,813
about the proper height for a taper.

558
00:28:10,607 --> 00:28:11,984
Midori Sour?

559
00:28:12,943 --> 00:28:15,696
- No, thanks.
- More for me.

560
00:28:18,282 --> 00:28:21,785
My last coming-out, I shared with this girl
who couldn't handle her booze.

561
00:28:21,869 --> 00:28:24,371
Neon-green puke all over her white dress.

562
00:28:24,454 --> 00:28:25,747
Your last coming-out?

563
00:28:25,831 --> 00:28:27,708
This is my fifth one this year.

564
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:30,669
They say four out of five debs
marry their escorts.

565
00:28:30,752 --> 00:28:32,796
Kind of like the dentists with Trident.

566
00:28:32,838 --> 00:28:37,176
Five coming-out balls, five escorts.
One of them has to stick, right?

567
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:40,304
- Good logic.
- So is your escort the one?

568
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,639
- The one what?
- The one you're gonna marry.

569
00:28:42,723 --> 00:28:45,684
- Is he cute?
- Yes, he is very cute.

570
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:48,145
- Where will you live when you marry?
- Hold on.

571
00:28:48,187 --> 00:28:51,398
Katie, hi. Too bad about your face.

572
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:54,985
- Is it horrible?
- No, you can hardly tell.

573
00:28:55,194 --> 00:28:56,904
Just walk sideways.

574
00:28:57,404 --> 00:28:59,573
These things will be the death of me.

575
00:28:59,656 --> 00:29:02,117
I know. And we've had no time to prep.

576
00:29:02,201 --> 00:29:05,370
Jenna just got out of Rainbow Hills
two days ago.

577
00:29:05,871 --> 00:29:07,706
- Rehab?
- Fat farm.

578
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:12,044
Hi. Sorry to interrupt.
Could you come with me?

579
00:29:12,127 --> 00:29:14,755
My cummerbund and I
aren't seeing eye to eye.

580
00:29:14,838 --> 00:29:17,382
Men. Totally helpless. Excuse me.

581
00:29:19,176 --> 00:29:22,721
You saved me. I love you.
I want to have your baby.

582
00:29:22,888 --> 00:29:25,015
- Too late.
- I saw the look.

583
00:29:25,098 --> 00:29:28,143
The same one you had that time
you ended up on homecoming court.

584
00:29:28,227 --> 00:29:30,729
Someone's idea of a sick, sick joke.

585
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:35,400
By the way,
Neil Young's got nothing on you.

586
00:29:35,484 --> 00:29:36,944
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

587
00:29:37,569 --> 00:29:39,822
- Have you seen your father?
- No.

588
00:29:39,905 --> 00:29:41,740
He promised me he'd be here by now.

589
00:29:41,782 --> 00:29:44,660
- You didn't come together?
- I swear, if he misses this...

590
00:29:44,743 --> 00:29:47,162
- Did you call him?
- Of course I called him.

591
00:29:47,246 --> 00:29:49,206
I wouldn't go this long
without calling him.

592
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:51,291
- Emily, he's here.
- Where?

593
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:54,962
Where have you been?

594
00:29:58,131 --> 00:30:00,926
I can't look. Did she bean him
with the baby's breath?

595
00:30:00,968 --> 00:30:03,929
No, they're just energetically
practicing their sign language.

596
00:30:04,012 --> 00:30:05,264
Oh, God.

597
00:30:05,764 --> 00:30:08,559
Okay, I think this is a really good time
for a martini.

598
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,727
Hello? Thirsty people here.

599
00:30:11,728 --> 00:30:14,314
- What are you doing?
- Steve won't mind.

600
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:16,775
Little tip, never a good idea
to let people know...

601
00:30:16,859 --> 00:30:19,945
you're on a first-name basis
with the bartender.

602
00:30:20,445 --> 00:30:22,739
- This is really something.
- What?

603
00:30:22,781 --> 00:30:25,117
You and I together at a debutante ball.

604
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:26,368
Yeah.

605
00:30:26,451 --> 00:30:28,579
Just like it would have been 16 years ago.

606
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,831
- Fancy dress.
- Sneaking booze.

607
00:30:30,914 --> 00:30:33,625
- Parents acting crazy.
- You look great.

608
00:30:35,294 --> 00:30:37,963
- I'm so glad you're here.
- So am I.

609
00:30:39,131 --> 00:30:43,093
All fathers, please report
to the debutante staging area upstairs.

610
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,137
Fathers, to the staging area.

611
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:48,265
- Showtime. You gonna be all right?
- Absolutely.

612
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,769
I'll see you later.

613
00:30:53,562 --> 00:30:54,813
Curtsy pretty.

614
00:30:58,317 --> 00:31:01,570
Just wanted to see you before
you became a proper lady of society.

615
00:31:01,653 --> 00:31:03,238
- What do you think?
- I think...

616
00:31:03,322 --> 00:31:06,366
- you look like a cotton ball.
- Why, thank you, Jeeves.

617
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:08,619
But a really cute cotton ball.

618
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,204
Oh, my God, is this your escort?

619
00:31:10,287 --> 00:31:13,332
- Yeah, it is.
- You are totally getting married.

620
00:31:16,168 --> 00:31:18,670
- What did she say?
- Well...

621
00:31:19,046 --> 00:31:20,672
Dad. Great, let's go.

622
00:31:20,756 --> 00:31:23,675
- I'll meet you downstairs. Good luck.
- Okay.

623
00:31:24,176 --> 00:31:26,470
Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.

624
00:31:26,512 --> 00:31:28,680
If everyone could please take their seat.

625
00:31:28,764 --> 00:31:30,682
We're about to get started with...

626
00:31:30,724 --> 00:31:32,935
Last chance
to shimmy down the drainpipe.

627
00:31:33,018 --> 00:31:34,645
- Do me a favor?
- Anything.

628
00:31:34,686 --> 00:31:37,231
- Just don't let me fall.
- Right back at you.

629
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,861
Good evening.

630
00:31:42,945 --> 00:31:45,697
On behalf of the
Daughters of the American Revolution...

631
00:31:45,781 --> 00:31:49,910
I would like to welcome you
to our annual debutante ball.

632
00:31:50,202 --> 00:31:52,663
This brings back so many memories.

633
00:31:52,704 --> 00:31:56,041
I myself came out in this very hall in 19...

634
00:31:56,583 --> 00:31:59,503
Well, let's just say a number of years ago.

635
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:04,675
Now, the word 'debutante'
comes from the French word 'dbuter'...

636
00:32:04,716 --> 00:32:07,135
- You're being irrational.
...which means to lead off.

637
00:32:07,219 --> 00:32:10,347
- Just come sit down.
- I'm going to finish my drink.

638
00:32:10,389 --> 00:32:13,308
You won't be happy
until you've spoiled this evening.

639
00:32:13,392 --> 00:32:15,853
Guys, there's a lady up there with...

640
00:32:15,936 --> 00:32:20,357
a rock the size of Neptune, talking
about the debutantes of ancient Greece.

641
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:24,194
It's a lot easier to fall asleep
if you're sitting down. Trust me.

642
00:32:24,236 --> 00:32:26,530
I will sit down
when I am ready to sit down.

643
00:32:26,572 --> 00:32:29,241
- Lower your voice.
- No, I will not lower my voice.

644
00:32:29,324 --> 00:32:32,703
I paid a fortune to be here,
and I will speak as loudly as I like.

645
00:32:32,744 --> 00:32:34,955
You're embarrassing us,
embarrassing Rory.

646
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:38,041
This wasn't Rory's idea.
This was your idea.

647
00:32:38,167 --> 00:32:40,252
This ridiculous evening was your idea.

648
00:32:40,335 --> 00:32:42,254
You don't want her presented to society?

649
00:32:42,337 --> 00:32:44,882
To hell with society!
Yes, I'm talking about you!

650
00:32:44,965 --> 00:32:46,425
Come on, that's it.

651
00:32:47,092 --> 00:32:49,178
Are you two
completely out of your minds?

652
00:32:49,261 --> 00:32:51,096
There's a ceremony going on in there.

653
00:32:51,138 --> 00:32:54,224
Young girls in ugly dresses
and stupid fans are parading around...

654
00:32:54,308 --> 00:32:57,144
in circles for whatever reason,
and you two are ruining it.

655
00:32:57,227 --> 00:32:59,563
I didn't want to come here. You knew that.

656
00:32:59,605 --> 00:33:02,316
That's too bad.
We have a social responsibility.

657
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,610
I am so tired of hearing you say that.

658
00:33:04,693 --> 00:33:07,905
People expect us to be certain places
and do certain things.

659
00:33:07,946 --> 00:33:09,865
We can't just withdraw from all that.

660
00:33:09,948 --> 00:33:11,658
You know what I'm going through
at work?

661
00:33:11,742 --> 00:33:14,411
Your whole life isn't that damn company.

662
00:33:14,453 --> 00:33:17,873
I have told you what I'm going through,
but you don't seem to hear it.

663
00:33:17,956 --> 00:33:20,000
You don't listen to me or anybody.

664
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:21,793
- That is not true.
- It is.

665
00:33:21,835 --> 00:33:24,588
Isn't it true? Has she ever listened
to a word you've said?

666
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:27,758
People listen in different ways.

667
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:30,802
Right? Some people listen with their ears
and some people...

668
00:33:30,886 --> 00:33:32,346
listen with not their ears.

669
00:33:32,429 --> 00:33:36,099
But that doesn't mean some listening
hasn't happened in some form.

670
00:33:36,141 --> 00:33:39,520
I have listened to you, Richard.
I know exactly what is going on.

671
00:33:39,603 --> 00:33:41,063
Really? What?

672
00:33:41,146 --> 00:33:42,773
- You lost an account.
- What?

673
00:33:42,814 --> 00:33:46,360
No. I didn't lose an account.
I was taken off an account.

674
00:33:46,443 --> 00:33:50,823
I was taken off an account that I brought
into this company 10 years ago.

675
00:33:50,864 --> 00:33:52,366
There are other accounts.

676
00:33:52,449 --> 00:33:55,035
I have been in charge of that account
for 10 years!

677
00:33:55,118 --> 00:33:58,288
How can you be so angry?
Yes, they took you off that account...

678
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:00,666
but they also gave you a promotion.

679
00:34:00,749 --> 00:34:02,292
You said they moved you upstairs...

680
00:34:02,334 --> 00:34:06,463
to a larger office and gave you a new title
and a better parking space.

681
00:34:06,505 --> 00:34:09,591
- Damn it. I am being phased out.
- You are not.

682
00:34:09,675 --> 00:34:14,054
I know whether I'm being phased out.
I invented 'phased out' for this company.

683
00:34:14,137 --> 00:34:17,057
Don't you think I did
the exact same thing to Allen Parker?

684
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:20,352
- Allen Parker retired.
- Allen Parker was phased out.

685
00:34:20,394 --> 00:34:23,397
I now have his office.
I now have his parking space.

686
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,190
You know what happens from here?

687
00:34:25,274 --> 00:34:28,318
I lose more accounts slowly, but surely.

688
00:34:28,694 --> 00:34:32,322
They will put a younger man on them
with me to be trained by the best.

689
00:34:32,364 --> 00:34:35,409
Then one day, they'll call and ask me...

690
00:34:35,492 --> 00:34:39,371
to let that young man take a meeting
without me, to see how fast he's learning.

691
00:34:39,454 --> 00:34:43,000
And then, suddenly,
that young man is given that account.

692
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:46,211
And this happens
again and again and again...

693
00:34:46,253 --> 00:34:49,756
until I am nothing
but a symbolic figurehead...

694
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,843
that they roll out for banquets
and group pictures.

695
00:34:52,885 --> 00:34:55,012
And then, one day, Emily...

696
00:34:55,804 --> 00:34:57,848
I will be asked to leave.

697
00:35:01,059 --> 00:35:02,519
Well, so what?

698
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:04,521
Excuse me?

699
00:35:04,563 --> 00:35:07,566
- I don't think Mom meant exactly...
- So what if that's true?

700
00:35:07,608 --> 00:35:09,985
- Or maybe she did.
- There are other options.

701
00:35:10,068 --> 00:35:12,154
I don't want other options.

702
00:35:12,237 --> 00:35:14,656
I want to get up every morning
and put on my suit...

703
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:18,577
and go to my office and do my work,
like I've done every day for 30 years.

704
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:21,580
That's what I want to do.
That's the only thing I want to do.

705
00:35:21,622 --> 00:35:24,917
Excuse me. Hi.
Sorry to interrupt, but I'm next.

706
00:35:31,173 --> 00:35:32,716
Elizabeth Doty.

707
00:35:32,966 --> 00:35:37,513
Daughter of George Edward Doty IV
and Eleanor Doty.

708
00:35:43,185 --> 00:35:44,937
Lorelai Gilmore.

709
00:35:45,187 --> 00:35:49,233
Daughter of Christopher Hayden
and Lorelai Gilmore.

710
00:36:23,642 --> 00:36:26,144
That should have been you up there.

711
00:36:26,895 --> 00:36:30,065
Nothing's turning out the way
it was supposed to.

712
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:49,293
Did you know
that you're considered a hot dad?

713
00:36:49,334 --> 00:36:50,377
Really?

714
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,629
Libby said it's too bad you're my real dad.

715
00:36:52,671 --> 00:36:55,591
If you were my step-dad,
I could steal you away from Mom.

716
00:36:55,674 --> 00:36:57,593
Libby's got a good life ahead of her.

717
00:36:57,676 --> 00:36:59,386
I was very proud of all of you.

718
00:36:59,469 --> 00:37:02,472
You made it through the entire ceremony
with a straight face.

719
00:37:02,556 --> 00:37:03,849
Almost all of you.

720
00:37:03,932 --> 00:37:06,852
I'm sorry, but that fan dance
was more than I could take.

721
00:37:06,894 --> 00:37:09,146
- I need burger.
- Me, too. Dean?

722
00:37:09,188 --> 00:37:12,357
The only thing I can think of
is taking off this tux.

723
00:37:12,441 --> 00:37:14,818
Watch it. You're talking to a lady now.

724
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:17,488
- How about if I do it at home?
- Better.

725
00:37:17,654 --> 00:37:21,325
- Thanks again for going with me.
- Tomorrow, you start paying.

726
00:37:21,366 --> 00:37:22,743
- Bye.
- Bye.

727
00:37:23,535 --> 00:37:24,953
And then there were three.

728
00:37:25,037 --> 00:37:27,456
I have to get back to Boston
in the morning...

729
00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:29,374
so I'm gonna call it a night, too.

730
00:37:29,458 --> 00:37:31,210
What? Not even time for fries?

731
00:37:31,293 --> 00:37:34,671
I'll get up a little early
and have coffee with you before I go.

732
00:37:34,713 --> 00:37:36,215
- Deal?
- Deal.

733
00:37:37,049 --> 00:37:40,219
Go ahead and order for us.
I'll be there in a sec.

734
00:37:43,096 --> 00:37:46,308
I just wanted to tell you
how amazing you were tonight.

735
00:37:46,391 --> 00:37:48,810
Really, you completely came through
for her.

736
00:37:48,894 --> 00:37:50,354
She deserves it.

737
00:37:50,395 --> 00:37:52,981
I haven't always given you
a lot of credit in the past...

738
00:37:53,065 --> 00:37:55,567
but I'm giving you credit now. Big credit.

739
00:37:55,651 --> 00:37:58,904
- Major credit. Buy yourself a sofa.
- Thanks. I will.

740
00:37:59,571 --> 00:38:00,906
You know...

741
00:38:01,448 --> 00:38:05,786
I happened to be looking through
some old maps this afternoon...

742
00:38:05,869 --> 00:38:10,165
and I couldn't help but notice
that Boston is not that far away.

743
00:38:10,541 --> 00:38:12,584
You needed a map to tell you that?

744
00:38:12,668 --> 00:38:16,964
I also noticed that that l-84
is a very good road.

745
00:38:17,047 --> 00:38:18,423
Solid, paved.

746
00:38:18,507 --> 00:38:21,218
I put this information
in my pretty little head.

747
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:25,222
I was thinking, if you wanted to
maybe drop by occasionally...

748
00:38:25,264 --> 00:38:26,640
it wouldn't be too difficult.

749
00:38:26,723 --> 00:38:29,601
You realize I'll be driving the Volvo?

750
00:38:30,102 --> 00:38:32,354
Actually, I'm coming around to the Volvo.

751
00:38:32,437 --> 00:38:34,606
- Really?
- Yes.

752
00:38:34,982 --> 00:38:38,152
I think it's sort of
a Catholic schoolgirl thing.

753
00:38:38,235 --> 00:38:42,614
You know, it's conservative
on the outside, bad on the inside.

754
00:38:42,698 --> 00:38:44,408
I like that image.

755
00:38:48,704 --> 00:38:52,249
I've also heard the l-84
can get jammed on weekends.

756
00:38:52,291 --> 00:38:53,625
It can.

757
00:38:53,709 --> 00:38:58,005
So if you wanted to stay a little longer,
just to avoid the traffic...

758
00:38:58,505 --> 00:39:00,090
it might be a good idea.

759
00:39:00,174 --> 00:39:02,968
I mean, Rory would definitely love it.

760
00:39:04,219 --> 00:39:06,138
And I wouldn't mind, either.

761
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:10,434
That is a tempting offer,
but I really have to get back.

762
00:39:11,977 --> 00:39:14,021
- To work?
- To work...

763
00:39:15,522 --> 00:39:17,608
and to someone.

764
00:39:20,986 --> 00:39:22,613
I know, I should have told you.

765
00:39:22,696 --> 00:39:26,158
- That's fine. It's totally your business.
- I meant to, but...

766
00:39:28,035 --> 00:39:30,037
It's just that you and I are so connected...

767
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,122
Chris, please. I get it.

768
00:39:32,414 --> 00:39:35,709
- I think it's really great. I really do.
- Thank you.

769
00:39:36,376 --> 00:39:38,295
So, who is it? Let me guess.

770
00:39:38,337 --> 00:39:40,297
Linda from marketing got to you.

771
00:39:40,339 --> 00:39:42,341
- Her name is Sherrie.
- Sherrie from marketing?

772
00:39:42,424 --> 00:39:45,093
- Sherrie from Boston.
- Hence the move.

773
00:39:45,177 --> 00:39:47,638
- Is it serious?
- It's getting there.

774
00:39:47,763 --> 00:39:49,932
'Seeing you in just a bow tie' serious?

775
00:39:50,015 --> 00:39:51,850
We're living together.

776
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:54,770
You really have changed.

777
00:39:54,853 --> 00:39:59,191
Sherrie made it clear I was gonna lose her
if I didn't start getting it together.

778
00:39:59,233 --> 00:40:02,653
If you find a girl who's good
with dating a square in a Volvo...

779
00:40:02,694 --> 00:40:04,905
you do what it takes to keep her.

780
00:40:07,866 --> 00:40:10,828
So I'll see you back home.

781
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:12,454
Yes, you will.

782
00:40:35,394 --> 00:40:36,520
What?

783
00:40:36,562 --> 00:40:41,233
After all you've been through tonight,
I come in and find you eating like that?

784
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:45,529
- There you go.
- Being a lady is hard.

785
00:40:45,571 --> 00:40:48,240
So, tonight? What's the consensus?

786
00:40:48,699 --> 00:40:52,161
The fan dance was humiliating.
I'm never doing a curtsy again.

787
00:40:52,244 --> 00:40:53,996
But having Dad around was great.

788
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:56,665
- Yeah, it was.
- He's got a new girlfriend.

789
00:40:56,748 --> 00:40:58,167
- Sherrie.
- Yeah.

790
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:00,919
Poor girI's named after a Journey song.
That's rough.

791
00:41:01,003 --> 00:41:04,548
- He seems happy.
- He does. He really does.

792
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:06,425
- I'm glad.
- Me, too.

793
00:41:06,508 --> 00:41:08,760
I feel kind of bad for Grandma, though.

794
00:41:08,802 --> 00:41:11,763
She was so into this night,
and she ended up being so miserable.

795
00:41:11,847 --> 00:41:14,308
Don't worry.
She'll have more fun at the next one.

796
00:41:14,391 --> 00:41:15,517
- Excuse me?
- Yes.

797
00:41:15,601 --> 00:41:17,895
We have you signed up
for the next six balls.

798
00:41:17,936 --> 00:41:19,771
- Not funny.
- You're doing this...

799
00:41:19,855 --> 00:41:22,608
- till you bring home a prize.
- Ignoring you now.

800
00:41:24,776 --> 00:41:26,111
Back from the ball?

801
00:41:26,195 --> 00:41:28,780
I left behind a glass slipper
and a business card...

802
00:41:28,864 --> 00:41:30,657
in case the prince is really dumb.

803
00:41:30,741 --> 00:41:32,868
Good and desperate thinking.

804
00:41:33,118 --> 00:41:35,913
- Thank you. Luke.
- What?

805
00:41:42,377 --> 00:41:44,046
What do you think you're doing?

806
00:41:44,129 --> 00:41:46,048
- Working.
- So you think this is funny?

807
00:41:46,131 --> 00:41:48,258
I'm sorry, I thought this was the uniform.

808
00:41:48,342 --> 00:41:51,595
You know what?
That's fine. Have your little joke.

809
00:41:51,637 --> 00:41:52,763
Doesn't bother me at all.

810
00:41:52,804 --> 00:41:56,767
You just go over there and clean off
that table. I'm ignoring you.

811
00:41:56,808 --> 00:41:59,102
- You do not exist.
- Okay.

812
00:42:05,776 --> 00:42:09,446
- That's it. Get upstairs and change.
- Whatever you say, Uncle Luke.

813
00:42:09,488 --> 00:42:13,116
It's Luke. Just Luke. Mr. Luke.

814
00:42:13,158 --> 00:42:15,452
In fact, don't address me at all!

815
00:42:15,494 --> 00:42:18,956
- You know, I'm really lucky.
- Yeah? Why?

816
00:42:18,997 --> 00:42:22,960
I have someone to complain to
when life sucks or work sucks...

817
00:42:23,043 --> 00:42:26,296
or just everything sucks,
I have someone I can talk to.

818
00:42:26,338 --> 00:42:29,007
- Yeah? Who?
- Shecky, you kill me.

819
00:42:29,925 --> 00:42:32,135
It must be really lonely not to have that.

820
00:42:32,177 --> 00:42:34,012
You thinking about Grandma?

821
00:42:34,263 --> 00:42:36,807
I'm just thinking.

822
00:42:46,024 --> 00:42:47,276
Hey, Mom.

823
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:50,237
- What are you doing here?
- Nothing much.

824
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,448
I had a little time
before my business class, and I thought:

825
00:42:53,532 --> 00:42:57,035
'Hey, why don't I go over to Mom's house
and just hang?'

826
00:42:57,369 --> 00:42:58,954
- Just what?
- Just hang.

827
00:42:59,037 --> 00:43:02,166
You know, hang out, talk,
don't talk, whatever.

828
00:43:02,249 --> 00:43:03,584
Just hang.

829
00:43:05,669 --> 00:43:07,838
- You're gardening, huh?
- Yes.

830
00:43:08,172 --> 00:43:12,676
Okay, well, don't let me stop you.
I'll just sit here...

831
00:43:13,677 --> 00:43:15,012
and just hang.

832
00:43:15,053 --> 00:43:17,055
Are you sure you don't need something?

833
00:43:17,139 --> 00:43:19,266
Nope. I'm just here to hang.

834
00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:23,604
Well.

835
00:43:26,815 --> 00:43:30,819
Mom, if there's ever anything
you want to talk about with me, you can.

836
00:43:32,863 --> 00:43:34,198
All right.

837
00:43:35,491 --> 00:43:36,575
Okay.

838
00:43:38,577 --> 00:43:39,578
So...

839
00:44:23,956 --> 00:44:24,998
English
