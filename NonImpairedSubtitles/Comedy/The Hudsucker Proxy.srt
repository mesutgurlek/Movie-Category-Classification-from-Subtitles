1
00:00:36,386 --> 00:00:37,745
That's right.

2
00:00:38,785 --> 00:00:39,986
New York.

3
00:00:40,706 --> 00:00:42,347
It's 1958.

4
00:00:44,067 --> 00:00:46,628
Anyway, for a few more minutes it is.

5
00:00:47,588 --> 00:00:50,628
Come midnight, it's going to be 1959.

6
00:00:51,389 --> 00:00:53,588
A whole other feeling.

7
00:00:53,628 --> 00:00:55,109
The New Year.

8
00:00:55,909 --> 00:00:57,109
The future.

9
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:02,190
Old Daddy Earth fixing to start
one more trip around the sun.

10
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:06,071
Everybody hoping this ride round
be a little more giddy...

11
00:01:06,872 --> 00:01:08,271
...a little more gay.

12
00:01:08,991 --> 00:01:12,392
All over town, champagne corks
is a-popping.

13
00:01:13,352 --> 00:01:17,913
Over in the Waldorf, the big shots is
dancing to the strains of Guy Lombardo.

14
00:01:19,234 --> 00:01:24,074
In Times Square, the little folks is watching
and waiting for that big ball to drop.

15
00:01:25,674 --> 00:01:29,115
They're all trying to catch hold
of one moment of time...

16
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:31,155
...to be able to say:

17
00:01:31,395 --> 00:01:33,155
"Right now! This is it!

18
00:01:33,995 --> 00:01:35,036
I got it!"

19
00:01:37,196 --> 00:01:39,155
Of course, by then it'll be past.

20
00:01:39,755 --> 00:01:41,356
But they're all happy...

21
00:01:42,116 --> 00:01:44,117
...everybody having a good time.

22
00:01:45,157 --> 00:01:46,678
Well, almost everybody.

23
00:01:47,998 --> 00:01:50,998
There's a few lost souls
floating around out there.

24
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:55,479
Now, if y'all ain't from the city...

25
00:01:55,919 --> 00:01:58,359
...we got something here
called "the rat race".

26
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:03,440
Got a way of chewing folks up
so that they don't want no celebrating...

27
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,641
...don't want no cheering up.

28
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:08,242
Don't care nothing about no New Year's.

29
00:02:09,281 --> 00:02:10,441
Out of hope...

30
00:02:10,722 --> 00:02:12,002
...out of rope...

31
00:02:12,162 --> 00:02:13,402
...out of time.

32
00:02:15,042 --> 00:02:16,963
This here is Norville Barnes.

33
00:02:18,803 --> 00:02:20,684
That office he's stepping out of...

34
00:02:20,764 --> 00:02:23,845
...is the office of the president
of Hudsucker Industries.

35
00:02:24,524 --> 00:02:25,844
That's his office.

36
00:02:27,244 --> 00:02:28,804
How'd he get so high?

37
00:02:29,765 --> 00:02:31,725
And why's he feeling so low?

38
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:35,166
Is he really going to do it?

39
00:02:35,846 --> 00:02:39,006
Is Norville really going
to jelly up the sidewalk?

40
00:02:40,645 --> 00:02:42,006
Well, the future...

41
00:02:42,486 --> 00:02:45,047
...that's something you can
never tell about.

42
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:47,368
But the past...

43
00:02:49,688 --> 00:02:51,288
...that's another story.

44
00:05:07,911 --> 00:05:10,351
So in the third quarter
we saw no signs of weakening.

45
00:05:10,431 --> 00:05:13,752
We're up 18%%% over last year's
third-quarter gross...

46
00:05:13,992 --> 00:05:16,352
...and that, needless to say,
is a new record.

47
00:05:16,432 --> 00:05:20,753
Our competition continues to flag
and we continue to take up the slack.

48
00:05:21,193 --> 00:05:23,714
Market shares in most divisions
is increasing...

49
00:05:23,794 --> 00:05:26,715
...and we have opened
seven new regional offices.

50
00:05:27,155 --> 00:05:28,594
Our international division...

51
00:05:28,674 --> 00:05:32,715
...is also showing vigorous signs of upward
movement for the last six months...

52
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,955
...and we're looking
at some exciting things in R&D.

53
00:06:14,482 --> 00:06:17,802
Sub-franchising. Don't talk to me
about sub-franchising.

54
00:06:17,962 --> 00:06:20,242
We're making so much money
in sub-franchising...

55
00:06:20,322 --> 00:06:21,883
...it isn't even funny.

56
00:06:22,163 --> 00:06:26,204
Our nominees and assigns continue
to multiply and expand...

57
00:06:26,284 --> 00:06:29,804
...extending our influence nationally
and abroad.

58
00:06:29,964 --> 00:06:32,324
Our owned and operateds are performing...

59
00:06:32,364 --> 00:06:35,485
...far beyond our expectations
both here and abroad.

60
00:06:35,605 --> 00:06:38,085
And the Federal Tax Act of 1958...

61
00:06:38,285 --> 00:06:41,886
...is giving us a swell write-off
on our plant and heavies.

62
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:09,891
And our last debenture issue
was this year's fastest seller.

63
00:07:10,411 --> 00:07:12,772
So, third quarter and year-to-date...

64
00:07:13,012 --> 00:07:16,932
...we have set a new record in sales,
a new record in gross...

65
00:07:17,012 --> 00:07:19,532
...a new record in pre-tax earnings...

66
00:07:19,732 --> 00:07:22,493
...a new record in after-tax profits...

67
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:25,534
...and our stock has split twice
in the past year.

68
00:07:25,894 --> 00:07:26,934
In short...

69
00:07:31,494 --> 00:07:32,854
...we're loaded.

70
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,943
Mr. Hudsucker?

71
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,560
It's a pity to waste a whole Monte Cristo.

72
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,920
He could've opened the window.

73
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,761
Waring Hudsucker never did anything
the easy way.

74
00:10:14,321 --> 00:10:17,281
Why? Why did he do it?
Everything was going so well.

75
00:10:18,081 --> 00:10:20,882
What am I, a headshrinker?
Maybe the man was unhappy.

76
00:10:21,042 --> 00:10:22,722
He didn't look unhappy.

77
00:10:22,882 --> 00:10:26,683
-He didn't look rich.
-He was never an easy man to figure out.

78
00:10:27,203 --> 00:10:29,724
He built this company with his bare hands.

79
00:10:30,364 --> 00:10:32,484
Every step he took was a step up...

80
00:10:33,524 --> 00:10:35,284
...except, of course, this last one.

81
00:10:35,364 --> 00:10:37,245
He was a swell fella...

82
00:10:38,045 --> 00:10:41,805
...but when the president, chairman
and owner of 87% of the stock...

83
00:10:41,885 --> 00:10:42,966
...drops...

84
00:10:43,606 --> 00:10:44,646
...44 floors...

85
00:10:44,726 --> 00:10:45,446
45.

86
00:10:45,526 --> 00:10:46,806
Counting the mezzanine.

87
00:10:46,966 --> 00:10:49,606
Then the company, too, has a problem.
Stillson!

88
00:10:51,766 --> 00:10:54,247
What exactly is the disposition
of Waring's stock?

89
00:10:54,407 --> 00:10:55,688
As you know...

90
00:10:55,768 --> 00:10:57,928
...Hud left no will and no family.

91
00:10:58,008 --> 00:11:00,968
The company bylaws are quite clear
in that event.

92
00:11:01,049 --> 00:11:04,329
"His entire portfolio will be converted
into common stock...

93
00:11:04,489 --> 00:11:08,650
"...and will be sold over the counter
as of the first of the fiscal year...

94
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,770
-"...following his demise".
-Meaning?

95
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:14,651
Meaning simply that Waring's stock
and control of the company...

96
00:11:14,771 --> 00:11:17,771
...will be made available
to the public January 1st.

97
00:11:19,452 --> 00:11:20,852
Do you mean to say...

98
00:11:21,052 --> 00:11:24,492
...that any slob in a smelly T-shirt
will be able to buy Hudsucker stock?

99
00:11:24,812 --> 00:11:26,813
The company bylaws are quite clear.

100
00:11:26,893 --> 00:11:28,854
My God! You're animals!

101
00:11:28,934 --> 00:11:33,014
How can you discuss his stock
when the man has just leapt 45 floors?

102
00:11:33,054 --> 00:11:33,894
44.

103
00:11:33,974 --> 00:11:35,534
Not counting the mezzanine.

104
00:11:35,614 --> 00:11:36,734
Quit showboating.

105
00:11:36,774 --> 00:11:39,135
The man is gone. The question now
is whether we'll let...

106
00:11:39,175 --> 00:11:42,095
...John Q. Public waltz in here
and buy our company.

107
00:11:42,175 --> 00:11:44,136
What are you suggesting?

108
00:11:44,216 --> 00:11:47,096
Certainly we can't afford
to buy a controlling interest.

109
00:11:47,336 --> 00:11:49,335
Not while the stock is this strong.

110
00:11:50,336 --> 00:11:52,656
How soon before Hud's paper
hits the market?

111
00:11:52,736 --> 00:11:53,537
January 1st.

112
00:11:53,577 --> 00:11:54,937
-Thirty days.
-Four weeks.

113
00:11:54,977 --> 00:11:56,898
-A month at the most.
-One month...

114
00:11:56,978 --> 00:11:59,138
...to make the blue-chip investment
of the century...

115
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,378
...look like a round-trip ticket
on the Titanic.

116
00:12:01,418 --> 00:12:04,058
We play up the fact that Hud is dead.

117
00:12:04,138 --> 00:12:05,539
Long live the Hud!

118
00:12:05,619 --> 00:12:06,659
We depress the stock.

119
00:12:06,739 --> 00:12:09,380
-To the point where we can buy 50%.
-51%.

120
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,740
Not counting the mezzanine.

121
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:11,740
It could work.

122
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,220
-It should work.
-It would work.

123
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,901
It's working already.

124
00:12:16,061 --> 00:12:18,901
Waring Hudsucker is abstract art
on Madison Avenue.

125
00:12:20,021 --> 00:12:24,262
What we need now is a new president
who will inspire panic in the stockholder.

126
00:12:24,422 --> 00:12:25,782
-A puppet!
-A proxy!

127
00:12:25,862 --> 00:12:26,783
A pawn!

128
00:12:29,223 --> 00:12:30,304
Some jerk...

129
00:12:30,904 --> 00:12:32,705
...we can really push around.

130
00:12:34,584 --> 00:12:38,184
You punch in at 8:30 every a.m.,
at 7:30 a.m. following a business holiday...

131
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:40,225
...unless it's a Monday, then it's 8:00.

132
00:12:40,305 --> 00:12:43,785
-Punch in late and they dock you.
-This goes to seven! Urgent.

133
00:12:43,825 --> 00:12:47,386
Incoming articles get a voucher.
Outgoing articles provide a voucher.

134
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:49,785
Move any article without a voucher,
they dock you!

135
00:12:49,865 --> 00:12:52,186
Take this up to the secretarial pool
on three! ASAP!

136
00:12:52,266 --> 00:12:54,827
Letter-size, a green voucher!
Folder-size, a yellow voucher!

137
00:12:54,867 --> 00:12:56,387
Parcel-size, a maroon voucher!

138
00:12:56,467 --> 00:12:58,468
This is for Morgatross! Chop-chop!

139
00:12:58,508 --> 00:13:00,668
Wrong color voucher and they dock you!

140
00:13:01,508 --> 00:13:03,869
6-7-8-7-0-4-9-Alpha-6!

141
00:13:04,149 --> 00:13:07,149
That is your employee number!
It will not be repeated!

142
00:13:07,349 --> 00:13:09,750
Without it, you can't cash your paycheck.

143
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,470
All right! This goes up to 27!

144
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:14,390
Return a waiver!
Do not return without a signed waiver!

145
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:18,432
Inter-office mail is code 37!
Intra-office mail is 37-3.

146
00:13:18,592 --> 00:13:20,751
Outside mail is 3-37.

147
00:13:20,911 --> 00:13:22,632
Code it wrong and they dock you!

148
00:13:22,672 --> 00:13:25,432
I was supposed to have this on 28
ten minutes ago!

149
00:13:25,752 --> 00:13:30,153
This has been your orientation.
Is there anything you do not understand?

150
00:13:30,353 --> 00:13:33,715
If you have not been fully orientated,
you must file a complaint!

151
00:13:33,795 --> 00:13:36,634
File a faulty complaint, and they dock you!

152
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:42,915
Kloppitt.

153
00:13:43,075 --> 00:13:45,876
Kloppitt, Kloppitt, Kloppitt, Kloppitt....

154
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:47,316
Max Kloppitt.

155
00:13:47,396 --> 00:13:49,556
"Max Kloppitt, Jr".

156
00:13:57,797 --> 00:14:00,918
What do you do when the envelope
is too big for the slot?

157
00:14:02,198 --> 00:14:04,359
If you fold them, they fire you.

158
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:07,959
I usually throw them out.

159
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,720
Just got hired today.

160
00:14:16,201 --> 00:14:17,081
Terrific.

161
00:14:17,841 --> 00:14:18,801
Entry level.

162
00:14:21,801 --> 00:14:22,762
But...

163
00:14:23,402 --> 00:14:24,762
...I got big ideas.

164
00:14:25,442 --> 00:14:26,722
I'm sure you do.

165
00:14:27,202 --> 00:14:28,363
For instance...

166
00:14:29,483 --> 00:14:30,683
...look at this sweet baby.

167
00:14:34,445 --> 00:14:35,885
I developed it myself.

168
00:14:35,964 --> 00:14:38,284
Yes, sirree, this is my ticket upstairs.

169
00:14:41,805 --> 00:14:43,165
You know, for kids.

170
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:45,045
Terrific.

171
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:49,006
So, you see. I won't be working
in the mail room long.

172
00:14:49,086 --> 00:14:50,926
No, I don't guess you will be.

173
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,646
How long've you been here?

174
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:54,926
Forty-eight years.

175
00:14:55,406 --> 00:14:57,647
Next year they move me up to parcels...

176
00:14:58,687 --> 00:14:59,968
...if I'm lucky.

177
00:15:02,128 --> 00:15:03,968
Attention Hudsucker employees:

178
00:15:04,368 --> 00:15:08,009
We regretfully announce
that at 30 seconds after the hour of noon...

179
00:15:08,129 --> 00:15:09,329
...Hudsucker time...

180
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,970
...Waring Hudsucker, Founder, President...

181
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:15,010
...and Chairman of the Board
of Hudsucker Industries...

182
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:16,530
...merged with the infinite.

183
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:19,171
To mark this occasion of corporate loss...

184
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:23,212
...we ask that all employees observe
a moment of silent contemplation.

185
00:15:30,053 --> 00:15:31,933
Thank you for your kind attention.

186
00:15:32,133 --> 00:15:35,014
This moment has been duly noted
on your timecards...

187
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:38,214
...and will be deducted from your pay.
That is all.

188
00:15:41,455 --> 00:15:42,615
Blue letter!

189
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:43,895
Blue letter!

190
00:15:43,975 --> 00:15:45,655
They're bringing a blue letter!

191
00:16:18,381 --> 00:16:19,781
It's a blue letter.

192
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:21,742
Top, top level.

193
00:16:22,422 --> 00:16:24,782
Confidential communication
between the brass.

194
00:16:25,702 --> 00:16:27,022
Usually bad news.

195
00:16:27,902 --> 00:16:29,742
They hate blue letters upstairs.

196
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:34,744
Hate them.

197
00:16:34,824 --> 00:16:35,624
You!

198
00:16:36,144 --> 00:16:37,505
Yeah, you! Barnes!

199
00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:39,264
You don't look busy!

200
00:16:39,824 --> 00:16:41,784
Think you can handle a blue letter?

201
00:16:41,864 --> 00:16:46,305
This letter was sent this morning
by the big man himself, Waring Hudsucker!

202
00:16:46,545 --> 00:16:49,986
It's addressed to Sid Mussburger,
Hudsucker's right-hand man!

203
00:16:50,146 --> 00:16:51,586
It's a blue letter!

204
00:16:51,986 --> 00:16:54,866
That means you got to put it right
in Mussburger's hands.

205
00:16:55,026 --> 00:16:57,226
No secretaries! No receptionists!

206
00:16:57,426 --> 00:16:59,587
No colleagues! No excuses!

207
00:17:00,507 --> 00:17:01,668
Mussburger!

208
00:17:03,508 --> 00:17:07,509
Hi! My name's Buzz, I got the fuzz,
I make the elevator do what she does.

209
00:17:08,269 --> 00:17:09,428
Hang it up to dry.

210
00:17:09,508 --> 00:17:11,349
-What's your pleasure?
-Fourty-four.

211
00:17:11,509 --> 00:17:14,310
Forty-four, the top-brass floor.
Say, buddy...

212
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:18,070
...what takes 50 years to get to
the top floor and 30 seconds to get down?

213
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,471
Waring Hudsucker! You get it, buddy?

214
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:23,991
Say, buddy! Mr. Kline, up to nine.
Mrs. Dell, Personnel.

215
00:17:24,111 --> 00:17:25,992
-Mr. Levin, 37.
-Thirty-six.

216
00:17:26,072 --> 00:17:27,112
Walk down!

217
00:17:27,192 --> 00:17:28,872
Ladies and gentlemen,
please step to the rear.

218
00:17:28,952 --> 00:17:30,952
Here comes the gargantuan Mr. Grier.

219
00:17:33,233 --> 00:17:36,394
Buddy, who's the most liquid businessman
on the street?

220
00:17:36,474 --> 00:17:37,755
Waring Hudsucker.

221
00:17:38,395 --> 00:17:41,874
When is the sidewalk fully dressed?
When it's wearing Hudsucker!

222
00:17:43,074 --> 00:17:43,995
You get it?

223
00:17:44,075 --> 00:17:47,395
It's a pun, a knee-slapper,
a play on Jesus, Joseph and Mary....

224
00:17:47,515 --> 00:17:48,915
Is that a blue letter?

225
00:17:48,955 --> 00:17:52,956
Why didn't you tell a guy? Hold on, folks,
we're express to the top floor!

226
00:18:07,718 --> 00:18:08,999
Good luck, buddy.

227
00:18:12,199 --> 00:18:13,439
You'll need it.

228
00:18:25,841 --> 00:18:27,442
Mr. Mussburger's office?

229
00:19:22,451 --> 00:19:23,451
Hello.

230
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:26,611
Do you have an appointment?

231
00:19:28,212 --> 00:19:30,172
Shall we look in the book?

232
00:19:32,332 --> 00:19:35,053
-We don't seem to be in the book.
-I wouldn't be.

233
00:19:35,213 --> 00:19:38,694
If we had an appointment,
we'd be in the book.

234
00:19:39,214 --> 00:19:40,375
I have this....

235
00:19:40,934 --> 00:19:42,134
Oh, here it is.

236
00:19:47,695 --> 00:19:48,615
Gambotz?

237
00:19:49,495 --> 00:19:50,695
Harry Gambotz?

238
00:19:50,895 --> 00:19:53,376
No, too risky.
He's green but he's not slow.

239
00:19:54,856 --> 00:19:55,856
Who is he?

240
00:19:56,175 --> 00:19:58,936
No, I want an imbecile,
not a cipher, or you'd have the job.

241
00:20:01,297 --> 00:20:03,057
They moved him to grommets and O-rings.

242
00:20:03,097 --> 00:20:04,458
He's doing pretty well.

243
00:20:05,778 --> 00:20:07,378
No, not McClanahan.

244
00:20:08,338 --> 00:20:11,258
He bungled the Teleyard merger
so he's got something to prove.

245
00:20:11,538 --> 00:20:12,779
Who let you in?

246
00:20:13,459 --> 00:20:16,380
Atwater? Tremendous.
Except I just fired him last week.

247
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,180
Mr. Mussburger...

248
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,180
...Mr. Bumstead's waiting downstairs.

249
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,421
-I'll be right there.
-Yes, Mr. Mussburger.

250
00:20:22,461 --> 00:20:23,541
Spit it out!

251
00:20:25,502 --> 00:20:27,861
Maybe you're
the company's biggest moron.

252
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:31,582
We can't use Morris. Been here too long.
He's a nice guy with too many friends.

253
00:20:31,662 --> 00:20:34,543
In fact, why don't you fire him?
Scratch that, I'll fire him.

254
00:20:35,103 --> 00:20:36,543
Make it fast. Fast!

255
00:20:37,023 --> 00:20:38,904
Mr. Bumstead is growing restless.

256
00:20:38,984 --> 00:20:41,345
Tell him I'll be right there.
Give him a magazine.

257
00:20:41,425 --> 00:20:42,864
What are you, a mute?

258
00:20:44,504 --> 00:20:45,784
How's the stock?

259
00:20:45,904 --> 00:20:47,905
Bad? Well, it's not bad enough.

260
00:20:48,545 --> 00:20:49,665
Listen, chump.

261
00:20:49,745 --> 00:20:53,786
Either you find me a ding-dong or tender
your key to the executive washroom.

262
00:20:53,866 --> 00:20:56,586
That goes double for you, pal.
Earclay? Oodgay!

263
00:21:01,146 --> 00:21:03,427
This better be good. I'm in a bad mood.

264
00:21:04,507 --> 00:21:07,828
Sir, I've got something for you
from the mail room, but first...

265
00:21:07,868 --> 00:21:12,708
...if I could take a minute of your very
valuable time to show you something...

266
00:21:12,788 --> 00:21:15,749
...I've been working on
for the past two or three years.

267
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,191
You know, for kids.

268
00:21:25,031 --> 00:21:27,871
It's perfect for Hudsucker,
not that I'm any great genius.

269
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:31,912
They say inspiration is 99% perspiration
and in my case it's at least twice that...

270
00:21:31,992 --> 00:21:34,872
-...but I've got to tell you, sir...
-Wait a minute!

271
00:22:17,639 --> 00:22:18,800
Sit down, son.

272
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,560
Go ahead.

273
00:22:24,401 --> 00:22:25,441
Try it on.

274
00:22:38,443 --> 00:22:39,724
Put your feet up.

275
00:22:43,485 --> 00:22:44,444
Go ahead.

276
00:22:46,564 --> 00:22:48,885
Let's get to know one another, shall we?

277
00:22:50,765 --> 00:22:51,885
Let's chat...

278
00:22:55,126 --> 00:22:56,126
...man-to-man.

279
00:23:03,126 --> 00:23:05,367
You're from the basement, aren't you?

280
00:23:06,528 --> 00:23:08,488
And weren't blessed with much...

281
00:23:10,608 --> 00:23:11,728
...education?

282
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:14,328
Well, I am a college graduate.

283
00:23:14,808 --> 00:23:17,289
But you did not excel in your studies.

284
00:23:17,369 --> 00:23:19,210
Well, I made the dean's list...

285
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:22,650
...at the Muncie College
of Business Administration.

286
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:26,651
And your friends called you "jerk",
didn't they?

287
00:23:28,212 --> 00:23:29,132
"Dope?"

288
00:23:29,252 --> 00:23:30,131
"Dipstick?"

289
00:23:30,171 --> 00:23:31,612
"Lamebrain?" "Schmo?"

290
00:23:31,692 --> 00:23:32,892
Not even behind your back?

291
00:23:32,972 --> 00:23:35,452
They voted me "Most Likely to Succeed".

292
00:23:35,532 --> 00:23:36,692
You're fired.

293
00:23:38,853 --> 00:23:42,054
Get your feet off my desk,
get out of my office.

294
00:23:42,614 --> 00:23:44,215
Leave your apron in the locker room.

295
00:23:44,734 --> 00:23:45,694
Oh, my God!

296
00:23:45,814 --> 00:23:50,015
The Bumstead contracts. I've been
working on that deal for four years!

297
00:23:50,175 --> 00:23:52,175
Get out of here! I'll take care of it!

298
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:56,096
You could have destroyed
the most sensitive document of my career.

299
00:23:56,176 --> 00:23:58,576
Mr. Bumstead is threatening to leave.

300
00:23:58,696 --> 00:23:59,975
I'm on my way down.

301
00:24:00,055 --> 00:24:03,376
We need the first page of the contract
retyped with copies going to Legal.

302
00:24:03,456 --> 00:24:04,977
Yes, Mr. Mussburger.

303
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:10,178
Out! Out of the office!

304
00:24:12,858 --> 00:24:14,019
Down three points?

305
00:24:14,099 --> 00:24:16,418
That's encouraging. How about New York?

306
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,299
Not that way, through the door!

307
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,580
It'll take three hours to retype
the Bumstead contracts.

308
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:23,700
Where are you going?

309
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,420
Get out! Stop that!

310
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,221
Mr. Bumstead's threatening to leave.

311
00:24:27,301 --> 00:24:29,742
Not the whole contract, just the first page.

312
00:24:30,022 --> 00:24:32,022
I'll be there. Give him another magazine.

313
00:24:32,062 --> 00:24:34,622
-He says he'll leave.
-I said I'll be there!

314
00:24:35,702 --> 00:24:39,143
Up on your feet! We don't crawl here
at Hudsucker Industries!

315
00:24:39,543 --> 00:24:41,304
-My leg is on fire!
-No assumptions!

316
00:24:41,344 --> 00:24:44,905
It's early yet. Just let me know
where we stand at the closing bell.

317
00:24:53,985 --> 00:24:56,105
Oh, my God, the Bumstead contracts!

318
00:25:01,345 --> 00:25:03,226
No magazines! No coffee!

319
00:25:03,426 --> 00:25:07,787
Mussburger! I want to see Mussburger!
Or did he jump out a window too?

320
00:25:08,828 --> 00:25:12,308
Don't worry, Mr. Mussburger, I got you!
I got you by your pants.

321
00:25:15,109 --> 00:25:15,989
Pants?

322
00:25:20,389 --> 00:25:24,150
Mr. Mussburger, I'm gonna give
your pants a nice double stitch.

323
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:28,191
It'll make them real strong
and you're going to look real sharp.

324
00:25:29,031 --> 00:25:31,431
No. Single stitch is fine.

325
00:25:31,631 --> 00:25:33,872
But the double stitch lasts forever.

326
00:25:35,032 --> 00:25:37,512
Why on earth would I want
a double stitch?

327
00:25:38,752 --> 00:25:40,153
To pad your account.

328
00:25:40,553 --> 00:25:42,034
Single stitch is fine.

329
00:25:48,114 --> 00:25:49,154
Damn!

330
00:25:55,515 --> 00:25:58,716
What the heck! Mr. Mussburger
is such a nice man...

331
00:25:59,076 --> 00:26:01,556
...I'm going to give him
a double stitch anyway.

332
00:26:02,635 --> 00:26:05,836
That's some strong stitch, you bet!

333
00:27:47,895 --> 00:27:49,934
"The Einstein of Enterprise".

334
00:27:50,934 --> 00:27:52,374
"The Edison of Industry".

335
00:27:53,575 --> 00:27:55,655
"The Billion-Dollar Cranium! "

336
00:27:57,455 --> 00:27:58,935
"Idea Man! "

337
00:28:00,736 --> 00:28:02,976
And not one of you has given me
a story on him!

338
00:28:03,016 --> 00:28:04,695
Bunch of lamebrains!

339
00:28:05,135 --> 00:28:07,696
Facts, figures, charts.
They never sold a newspaper!

340
00:28:07,856 --> 00:28:09,737
I read this morning's Argus
and let me tell you something:

341
00:28:09,817 --> 00:28:11,337
I'd wrap a fish in it!

342
00:28:11,418 --> 00:28:12,978
I'd use it as kindling!

343
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:17,258
I'd train my poodle on it if he wasn't
a French poodle and partial to Paris Soir.

344
00:28:17,418 --> 00:28:20,178
But I wouldn't pay a nickel
to read the thing!

345
00:28:20,258 --> 00:28:22,219
Come on, Chief, give us a break.

346
00:28:22,819 --> 00:28:24,820
Sure, Tibbs. Take a break.

347
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,580
Go to Florida. Lie in the sun.

348
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,541
Wait for a coconut to drop.
File a story on it.

349
00:28:30,861 --> 00:28:34,022
It'd be more of a grabber than your piece
on the county grain surplus!

350
00:28:34,102 --> 00:28:36,502
The human angle!
That's what sells papers!

351
00:28:36,862 --> 00:28:40,182
We need a front page with a heart
and the ldea Man can put it there!

352
00:28:40,262 --> 00:28:41,662
If we had more access...

353
00:28:41,702 --> 00:28:44,103
If a frog had wings
it wouldn't bump it's ass hopping.

354
00:28:44,183 --> 00:28:46,144
I don't want excuses, I want results!

355
00:28:46,544 --> 00:28:49,105
What makes the ldea Man tick?
Where's he from?

356
00:28:49,225 --> 00:28:52,664
I want to know everything about him!
Has he got a girl? Has he got parents?

357
00:28:52,744 --> 00:28:54,705
Everybody has parents.

358
00:28:54,865 --> 00:28:56,465
All right, how many?

359
00:28:57,545 --> 00:28:59,705
How about it, Parkinson?
You've been awfully quiet.

360
00:29:01,586 --> 00:29:02,986
Still waters run deep.

361
00:29:03,066 --> 00:29:05,465
Only thing deep with Parkinson
are the holes in his ears.

362
00:29:05,545 --> 00:29:07,106
Yes! ldea Man!

363
00:29:07,706 --> 00:29:10,827
What are his hopes and dreams,
his desires and aspirations?

364
00:29:11,107 --> 00:29:13,708
Does he think all the time
or a certain portion of the day?

365
00:29:13,748 --> 00:29:17,188
How tall is he? Where does he sleep?
What does he have for breakfast?

366
00:29:17,228 --> 00:29:19,389
Does he put jam on his toast
or doesn't he?

367
00:29:19,469 --> 00:29:21,428
If not, why not and since when?

368
00:29:22,389 --> 00:29:23,349
Well?

369
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,110
You're useless.

370
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,030
Yes. Idea Man.

371
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:29,630
"Creator".

372
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:30,711
"Innovator".

373
00:29:30,991 --> 00:29:32,271
"Cerebrator".

374
00:29:32,911 --> 00:29:33,912
Fake!

375
00:29:34,512 --> 00:29:36,471
I tell you, the guy's a phony.

376
00:29:36,551 --> 00:29:37,992
-Phony?
-As a $3 bill.

377
00:29:38,072 --> 00:29:39,672
-Says who?
-Says me, Amy Archer!

378
00:29:39,752 --> 00:29:41,992
Why is he an ldea Man?
Because Hudsucker says so?

379
00:29:42,032 --> 00:29:44,553
What are his ideas?
Why can't anyone interview him?

380
00:29:44,633 --> 00:29:46,634
Five bucks says she mentions her Pulitzer.

381
00:29:47,474 --> 00:29:49,355
Again? You're on.

382
00:29:49,435 --> 00:29:51,314
Look at the mug on this guy.

383
00:29:51,354 --> 00:29:54,394
The jutting eyebrows, the simian forehead,
the idiotic grin.

384
00:29:54,474 --> 00:29:56,275
He has a face only a mother could love...

385
00:29:57,635 --> 00:29:58,595
...on payday.

386
00:29:58,835 --> 00:30:01,676
The only story here is
how this guy made a monkey out of you.

387
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:04,236
Like it or not, I'm still editor of this rag.

388
00:30:04,436 --> 00:30:07,396
I thought you were writing,
"J. Edgar Hoover: When Will He Marry?"

389
00:30:07,476 --> 00:30:10,557
-I filed it yesterday. Nice tie, Earl.
-Well, do a follow-up.

390
00:30:10,677 --> 00:30:12,637
"Hoover: Crimebuster or Pantywaist?"

391
00:30:12,717 --> 00:30:15,798
The rest of you mugs get some brains
and get me that ldea Man story!

392
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:18,558
He's the bunk.

393
00:30:24,439 --> 00:30:26,200
I'll stake my Pulitzer on it!

394
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,600
Say, buddy, where'd you get the new duds?

395
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,481
Say, buddy, how did Old Bucketbutt
like his blue letter?

396
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:37,081
Did he bust a gut? Did he die?
Well, hello, Mr. Mussburger.

397
00:30:37,121 --> 00:30:38,522
Lobby, we haven't got all day.

398
00:30:38,562 --> 00:30:40,282
Right away, Mr. Mussburger.

399
00:30:40,402 --> 00:30:42,362
How're you this fine morning, sir?

400
00:30:43,122 --> 00:30:45,403
It's been a pleasure serving you today, sir.

401
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:48,004
It's been a pleasure serving you too, buddy.

402
00:30:48,164 --> 00:30:51,724
Shouldn't we be a little concerned
with the downward spiral of our stock...

403
00:30:51,804 --> 00:30:53,084
...these past few days?

404
00:30:53,164 --> 00:30:55,724
You're the expert,
but at the Muncie College of Business...

405
00:30:55,804 --> 00:30:57,445
Relax, it's only natural...

406
00:30:57,605 --> 00:31:01,005
...in a period of transition for
the more timid element to run for cover.

407
00:31:01,085 --> 00:31:04,606
Like I said, you're the expert
but do you remember the plan I outlined...

408
00:31:04,686 --> 00:31:07,725
...the day I set fire to your....
The day I was promoted?

409
00:31:08,125 --> 00:31:12,127
I do remember and I was impressed.
But that's all forgotten now.

410
00:31:14,207 --> 00:31:15,328
Thank you, Sid.

411
00:31:16,128 --> 00:31:19,568
The reason I mention it is it requires
such a small capital investment....

412
00:31:19,648 --> 00:31:22,768
-There's a huge potential profit...
-Damn it, where's my car?

413
00:31:22,848 --> 00:31:25,729
...given the demographics boom
of the burgeoning middle-class.

414
00:31:25,809 --> 00:31:29,690
So if you agree, I'd like to bounce the idea
off a few people at lunch.

415
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:30,730
Sure.

416
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:34,691
Tell whoever you want.
I'd like to hear about it at some point too.

417
00:31:43,652 --> 00:31:44,933
I got gas, Benny.

418
00:31:46,493 --> 00:31:47,773
Tell me about it.

419
00:31:48,214 --> 00:31:50,374
No kidding, Benny. I got gas.

420
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:52,574
You get the special?

421
00:31:52,934 --> 00:31:54,014
Far from it.

422
00:31:57,855 --> 00:31:59,055
Enter the dame.

423
00:31:59,815 --> 00:32:01,695
There's one in every story.

424
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:04,776
Ten bucks says she's looking for a handout.

425
00:32:05,096 --> 00:32:07,855
Twenty bucks says not here,
she don't find one.

426
00:32:08,455 --> 00:32:10,016
She's looking for her mark.

427
00:32:10,096 --> 00:32:11,256
She finds him.

428
00:32:11,336 --> 00:32:13,857
She sits down and orders...

429
00:32:15,177 --> 00:32:16,458
...a light lunch.

430
00:32:16,938 --> 00:32:19,058
How will she pay for this lunch?

431
00:32:19,498 --> 00:32:21,218
She looks through her purse.

432
00:32:21,499 --> 00:32:22,499
No money.

433
00:32:22,938 --> 00:32:24,579
The mark notices.

434
00:32:25,939 --> 00:32:27,580
He's not noticing, Benny.

435
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,020
Maybe he's wise.

436
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,820
He don't look wise.

437
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,101
Plan two.

438
00:32:34,421 --> 00:32:36,141
Here come the waterworks.

439
00:32:36,461 --> 00:32:38,461
-Yellowstone.
-Old Faithful.

440
00:32:38,541 --> 00:32:40,302
Hello, Niagara.

441
00:32:40,742 --> 00:32:41,862
He notices.

442
00:32:41,902 --> 00:32:43,262
She's distressed.

443
00:32:43,502 --> 00:32:44,862
He's concerned.

444
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:47,423
She explains her predicament.

445
00:32:47,783 --> 00:32:48,744
And....

446
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,304
Enter the light lunch.

447
00:32:52,465 --> 00:32:54,464
She's got other problems, of course.

448
00:32:54,544 --> 00:32:56,344
There's illness in the family.

449
00:32:56,784 --> 00:32:59,545
-Her mother needs an operation.
-Urgently.

450
00:32:59,705 --> 00:33:01,305
-Adenoids.
-No, Benny.

451
00:33:02,585 --> 00:33:03,986
Lumbago.

452
00:33:04,706 --> 00:33:06,946
That gag's got whiskers on it.

453
00:33:08,066 --> 00:33:09,585
He ain't biting, Benny.

454
00:33:09,665 --> 00:33:12,386
-She's losing him, Lou.
-Maybe he's wise.

455
00:33:12,986 --> 00:33:14,627
He don't look wise.

456
00:33:15,187 --> 00:33:17,828
-How does she pull this out?
-He's getting away.

457
00:33:17,908 --> 00:33:19,388
She better think fast.

458
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:20,988
She isn't.

459
00:33:21,308 --> 00:33:22,709
She is!

460
00:33:23,749 --> 00:33:25,068
She's good, Benny.

461
00:33:25,669 --> 00:33:27,109
She's damn good, Lou.

462
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:30,430
Can I get you boys anything else?

463
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:33,750
Bromo.

464
00:33:34,551 --> 00:33:35,631
Bromo.

465
00:33:37,552 --> 00:33:41,152
I'm sorry we had to take the stairs.
It was just that horrible elevator boy!

466
00:33:41,232 --> 00:33:44,192
I can't say how much I appreciate
your listening to my story.

467
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:48,513
I'm lucky to find someone in this bustling
city with a stout heart and a ready ear.

468
00:33:49,073 --> 00:33:51,274
There I was, travelling
through this great country.

469
00:33:51,354 --> 00:33:53,595
Some I met were kind to me,
others exceedingly cruel.

470
00:33:53,675 --> 00:33:55,994
Traveling by motor bus, rail,
even by thumb....

471
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,394
The couch, please.

472
00:33:57,514 --> 00:34:00,795
Hoarding every dollar, counting
every nickel, pinching every penny.

473
00:34:01,035 --> 00:34:03,635
It's been a long road leading
to the coffee shop downstairs.

474
00:34:03,675 --> 00:34:06,916
Not that I'd trade a day, an hour,
a moment of it for anything.

475
00:34:07,236 --> 00:34:08,756
I don't know what came over me.

476
00:34:08,836 --> 00:34:11,035
I guess it was the shock of eating
after so long...

477
00:34:11,116 --> 00:34:13,396
...without the enzymes kicking in
after so long....

478
00:34:17,358 --> 00:34:20,838
Then you couldn't possibly know
what it is to be tired and hungry.

479
00:34:21,038 --> 00:34:22,038
Hungry, anyway.

480
00:34:22,078 --> 00:34:25,078
I don't want to bore you with details
of my life. It's not happy.

481
00:34:25,158 --> 00:34:27,519
Suffice to say I'm jobless,
but not for want of trying.

482
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:31,040
I'm friendless, with no one to take care
of me and had you not come along...

483
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,720
-...exactly when you did....
-I, myself...

484
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,721
I arrived in town not ten days ago...

485
00:34:35,801 --> 00:34:38,882
...full of dreams, anxious to make my way
in the world...

486
00:34:38,922 --> 00:34:41,602
...a little naive perhaps,
but armed with determination...

487
00:34:41,682 --> 00:34:44,202
...a solid work ethic,
and an indomitable belief in the future...

488
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:46,082
-I, myself...
-...only to have that belief...

489
00:34:46,162 --> 00:34:49,363
...that unsullied optimism, dashed against
the marble of the workplace.

490
00:34:49,443 --> 00:34:52,364
Such is life. Seek and ye shall find.
Work and ye shall prosper.

491
00:34:52,444 --> 00:34:54,045
-Cigarette?
-No, thank you.

492
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:56,364
Seek and ye shall find,
work and ye shall prosper.

493
00:34:56,444 --> 00:34:59,084
These were the watchwords,
the ethos of my education...

494
00:34:59,164 --> 00:35:00,605
...the values instilled in me...

495
00:35:00,645 --> 00:35:03,845
...while I was growing up in a town
you've probably never heard of.

496
00:35:03,925 --> 00:35:05,525
-Mind if I join you?
-Be my guest.

497
00:35:05,605 --> 00:35:07,566
A town you've probably never heard of...

498
00:35:07,646 --> 00:35:10,406
...a dusty crossroads of which
you've probably never heard.

499
00:35:11,805 --> 00:35:14,406
Excuse me. Executive washroom.

500
00:35:17,527 --> 00:35:18,648
Are you all right?

501
00:35:21,088 --> 00:35:23,408
Is it your lunch? The chicken à la king?

502
00:35:26,048 --> 00:35:27,609
Is the à la king repeating on you?

503
00:35:28,089 --> 00:35:30,570
No, I'm fine. You were saying?

504
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:36,170
Values, watchwords, tender years.

505
00:35:36,651 --> 00:35:39,171
A little town you've probably
never heard of:

506
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:41,251
Muncie, Indiana.

507
00:35:42,171 --> 00:35:43,412
You're from Muncie?

508
00:35:44,532 --> 00:35:45,492
Why, yes.

509
00:35:46,372 --> 00:35:47,572
Do you know it?

510
00:36:03,975 --> 00:36:08,536
"Fight on
Fight on, dear old Muncie

511
00:36:09,296 --> 00:36:13,016
"Fight on
Hoist the gold and blue

512
00:36:13,136 --> 00:36:16,937
"You'll be tattered, torn and hurting

513
00:36:16,977 --> 00:36:20,938
"Once the Munce is done with...

514
00:36:21,658 --> 00:36:23,098
"...you.

515
00:36:27,898 --> 00:36:29,179
"Go...

516
00:36:29,859 --> 00:36:30,739
"Go...

517
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:32,460
"...Eagles!

518
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,580
"...Eagles! "

519
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,981
A Muncie girl!
What do you know about that?

520
00:36:41,182 --> 00:36:44,302
I'm going to cancel the rest
of my appointments for today...

521
00:36:44,422 --> 00:36:46,262
...and get you a job right here at Hud.

522
00:36:46,302 --> 00:36:47,822
Oh, no! Really...

523
00:36:48,062 --> 00:36:51,423
Don't bother to thank me. It's easy.
I know where a vacancy just came up.

524
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:52,583
Mailroom.

525
00:36:54,224 --> 00:36:55,865
Good afternoon, this is Norville Barnes.

526
00:36:55,945 --> 00:36:59,264
Barnes! Where the hell have you been?
Where's my voucher?

527
00:37:00,744 --> 00:37:01,744
I'm not sure.

528
00:37:01,865 --> 00:37:04,625
I need that voucher!
I told you a week ago it was important!

529
00:37:05,865 --> 00:37:07,545
I'm president of the company now.

530
00:37:07,585 --> 00:37:10,946
I don't care if you're president
of the company!

531
00:37:11,066 --> 00:37:13,105
I need the voucher now!

532
00:37:14,386 --> 00:37:16,386
Why don't you work in here with me?

533
00:37:16,546 --> 00:37:18,907
Are you familiar with
the mimeograph machine?

534
00:37:18,947 --> 00:37:23,228
Well, of course. I went
to the Muncie Secretarial Polytechnic.

535
00:37:23,508 --> 00:37:25,388
A Muncie girl! Can you beat that?

536
00:37:26,389 --> 00:37:28,948
I just don't know how to thank you,
Mr. Barnes.

537
00:37:28,988 --> 00:37:30,029
Please, Norville.

538
00:37:31,109 --> 00:37:32,590
Go, Eagles!

539
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:34,270
Go, Eagles!

540
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,151
"Once the Munce...".

541
00:37:39,471 --> 00:37:40,831
Holy moly!

542
00:37:40,991 --> 00:37:44,031
Is this guy from Chumpsville?
I even pulled the old mother routine.

543
00:37:44,111 --> 00:37:44,792
Adenoids?

544
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:45,752
Lumbago.

545
00:37:46,312 --> 00:37:47,832
That gag's got whiskers on it.

546
00:37:47,912 --> 00:37:50,272
I'm telling you, the Hudsucker Board's
up to something.

547
00:37:50,312 --> 00:37:53,153
What's a six-letter word
for an affliction of the hypothalamus?

548
00:37:53,233 --> 00:37:56,234
It's a cinch. Goiter.
It's a cinch this guy isn't in on it.

549
00:37:56,314 --> 00:37:57,275
She's right here.

550
00:37:57,355 --> 00:37:59,514
How much time to make the late final?

551
00:38:00,314 --> 00:38:02,634
Hi, Chief, just the person
I wanted to apologize to.

552
00:38:02,714 --> 00:38:03,915
About seven minutes.

553
00:38:04,075 --> 00:38:06,155
I was all wet about your ldea Man.

554
00:38:06,755 --> 00:38:11,036
Well, thanks for being so generous.
It is human and you are divine.

555
00:38:11,556 --> 00:38:13,316
No, he's no faker.

556
00:38:13,795 --> 00:38:17,036
He's a 100% real McCoy,
beware of imitations, genuine article.

557
00:38:17,356 --> 00:38:20,557
The guy's a real moron,
as in a five-letter word for imbecile.

558
00:38:20,717 --> 00:38:23,518
As pure a specimen as I've ever run across.

559
00:38:24,718 --> 00:38:26,118
If I'm not an expert...

560
00:38:26,158 --> 00:38:29,558
...then my name isn't Amy Archer
and I never won the Pulitzer.

561
00:38:29,958 --> 00:38:30,959
In 1957.

562
00:38:32,839 --> 00:38:34,760
My series on the reunited triplets.

563
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,840
Come down here, hammerhead,
and I'll show it to you!

564
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,801
What's a three-letter word
for a flightless bird?

565
00:38:40,881 --> 00:38:42,121
Not now, I'm busy.

566
00:38:42,402 --> 00:38:46,162
I said, "hammerhead" as in a ten-letter
word for a smug, bullying newspaper man.

567
00:38:46,322 --> 00:38:48,042
Gnu. That's G-N-U.

568
00:38:48,122 --> 00:38:51,523
Couldn't find the Empire State Building
with a compass, map and a guide.

569
00:38:51,603 --> 00:38:52,363
Or emu?

570
00:38:52,403 --> 00:38:56,004
That's just potatoes. Here's the gravy.
The chump really liked me.

571
00:38:56,164 --> 00:38:58,885
-A Muncie girl!
-Better off falling for a rattlesnake.

572
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:01,524
This guy's just a patsy
and I'm gonna find out what for.

573
00:39:01,604 --> 00:39:05,845
There's a real story here, some kind
of plot, set-up.... Did I tell you?

574
00:39:05,965 --> 00:39:07,765
-He didn't offer you money?
-A sawbuck!

575
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:09,765
Ten smackers! Let's grab a highball!

576
00:39:09,846 --> 00:39:11,246
On Norville Barnes.

577
00:39:12,526 --> 00:39:13,166
Copy!

578
00:39:41,851 --> 00:39:43,812
Miss Smith, would you come in
and take a letter?

579
00:39:45,051 --> 00:39:46,692
Of all the cockamamie....

580
00:39:48,932 --> 00:39:51,612
Did you see the front page
of today's Manhattan Argus?

581
00:39:51,692 --> 00:39:55,694
I didn't bother to read the article.
I didn't think the picture did you justice.

582
00:39:56,334 --> 00:39:57,774
The picture's fine.

583
00:39:57,814 --> 00:40:00,254
It's what that knuckle-headed dame
wrote underneath.

584
00:40:01,534 --> 00:40:02,774
Take this down.

585
00:40:02,974 --> 00:40:04,374
Dear Miss Archer:

586
00:40:05,175 --> 00:40:08,575
I call you "Miss" because you seem to have
missed the boat completely.

587
00:40:08,655 --> 00:40:10,575
How would you know if I'm an imbecile...

588
00:40:10,615 --> 00:40:13,496
...when you didn't have the guts
to interview me man-to-man!

589
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:15,056
Change "man-to-man" to "face-to-face".

590
00:40:15,136 --> 00:40:18,456
No, change "face-to-face" to "eye-to-eye"
and "guts" to "common decency".

591
00:40:18,496 --> 00:40:20,577
These wild speculations
about my intelligence...

592
00:40:20,657 --> 00:40:22,897
...these preposterous inventions
would be better suited...

593
00:40:22,937 --> 00:40:25,698
...for the pages of Amazing Tales Magazine.

594
00:40:25,938 --> 00:40:28,338
If the editors of the Manhattan Argus
see fit...

595
00:40:28,418 --> 00:40:32,619
...to publish the work of a disordered mind,
perhaps they will see fit to publish this.

596
00:40:32,699 --> 00:40:33,779
But I doubt it.

597
00:40:33,859 --> 00:40:37,700
I most seriously doubt it. I doubt also
you could find a home at Amazing Tales...

598
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:41,140
...a periodical which I have enjoyed
for many years. Sincerely...

599
00:40:41,461 --> 00:40:42,581
...et cetera.

600
00:40:49,662 --> 00:40:51,262
Is that all, Mr. Barnes?

601
00:40:53,543 --> 00:40:56,904
You know me, Amy, better than this dame.
Do you think I'm an imbecile?

602
00:40:57,224 --> 00:40:58,544
Well, I'm sure I....

603
00:40:58,864 --> 00:41:02,104
Tell the truth. I trust you.
I place a lot of stock in your opinion.

604
00:41:03,944 --> 00:41:05,665
Oh, sure, you're biased.

605
00:41:06,105 --> 00:41:07,545
You're a fellow Muncian.

606
00:41:08,465 --> 00:41:10,065
But let me ask you a question:

607
00:41:10,345 --> 00:41:12,546
Would an imbecile come up with this?

608
00:41:18,666 --> 00:41:20,106
I designed it myself.

609
00:41:21,227 --> 00:41:24,308
This sweet baby will put Hudsucker
right back on top.

610
00:41:26,948 --> 00:41:28,148
You know, for kids.

611
00:41:31,429 --> 00:41:33,549
Why don't I just type this up?

612
00:41:33,709 --> 00:41:36,510
That won't be necessary.
I shouldn't send it.

613
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:38,590
She's just doing her job, I guess.

614
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:41,150
I don't know, maybe she does deserve it.

615
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:44,671
Maybe she should have come in here
and faced you man-to-man.

616
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:48,432
-She probably had a deadline.
-She still could've gotten your side...

617
00:41:48,792 --> 00:41:49,992
...for the record.

618
00:41:50,072 --> 00:41:52,672
It's done now. What's the use
of grousing about it?

619
00:41:52,912 --> 00:41:55,713
Forget the letter,
I just had to blow off steam.

620
00:41:56,153 --> 00:41:58,154
She's probably just a little confused.

621
00:41:59,554 --> 00:42:00,394
"Confused?"

622
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:03,674
Probably a fast-talking career gal,
thinks she's one of the boys.

623
00:42:03,754 --> 00:42:05,554
Probably is, if you know what I mean.

624
00:42:05,634 --> 00:42:08,115
I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean.

625
00:42:08,235 --> 00:42:10,955
Probably suffers from one
of these complexes they have nowadays.

626
00:42:11,035 --> 00:42:14,676
It's obvious. She's probably
very unattractive and bitter about it.

627
00:42:14,836 --> 00:42:15,956
Is that it?

628
00:42:16,796 --> 00:42:20,476
She probably dresses in men's clothing,
drinks with the guys at the local bar...

629
00:42:20,556 --> 00:42:24,437
...hobnobs with some smooth-talking heel
reporter named Biff or Smoocher or...

630
00:42:24,517 --> 00:42:25,238
Smitty.

631
00:42:25,318 --> 00:42:27,718
Exactly. I bet she's ugly, real ugly.

632
00:42:27,798 --> 00:42:30,158
Otherwise, why isn't her picture
next to her byline?

633
00:42:30,198 --> 00:42:33,638
Maybe she puts her work
ahead of her personal appearance.

634
00:42:33,798 --> 00:42:35,599
I bet that's what she tells herself.

635
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:38,800
But you and I know
she's a dried-up, bitter old maid.

636
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,000
How about we grab a little dinner
and a show after work?

637
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,921
I was thinking maybe The King and I?

638
00:42:45,001 --> 00:42:46,282
How about Oklahoma?

639
00:42:46,482 --> 00:42:48,921
You don't know a thing about that woman!

640
00:42:49,001 --> 00:42:52,762
You don't know who she really is!
Only a numbskull thinks he knows things...

641
00:42:52,842 --> 00:42:54,962
...about things he knows nothing about.

642
00:42:56,763 --> 00:42:58,444
Say, what gives?

643
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:03,905
The inventory of the Jacksonville facility
should be reduced...

644
00:45:04,065 --> 00:45:07,024
...by 15%. Memo from the desk
of Sidney J. Mussburger...

645
00:45:07,184 --> 00:45:09,424
What are you doing, Miss Archer?

646
00:45:18,546 --> 00:45:21,305
Who are you?
How did you know who I am?

647
00:45:23,786 --> 00:45:26,987
I suspect Old Moses knows
just about everything...

648
00:45:27,507 --> 00:45:29,868
...leastways if it concerns Hudsucker.

649
00:45:30,348 --> 00:45:32,308
Who are you? What do you do here?

650
00:45:32,628 --> 00:45:34,469
I keep the old circle turning.

651
00:45:34,869 --> 00:45:36,989
This old clock needs plenty of care.

652
00:45:37,749 --> 00:45:39,469
Time is money, Miss Archer.

653
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:42,790
Money drives that old global economy...

654
00:45:42,830 --> 00:45:45,150
...and keeps Big Daddy Earth
spinning around.

655
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:47,831
See, without that capital formation...

656
00:45:49,672 --> 00:45:51,831
You won't tell anyone about me, will you?

657
00:45:51,991 --> 00:45:54,352
I don't tell no one nothing...

658
00:45:55,032 --> 00:45:56,432
...unless they ask.

659
00:45:56,792 --> 00:45:58,713
That just ain't Old Moses' way.

660
00:45:59,553 --> 00:46:01,153
If you know everything about Hudsucker...

661
00:46:01,233 --> 00:46:04,635
...tell me why the board decided
to make Norville Barnes president?

662
00:46:04,995 --> 00:46:07,554
That even surprised Old Moses at first.

663
00:46:08,114 --> 00:46:10,194
I didn't think the board was that smart.

664
00:46:10,274 --> 00:46:11,155
"That smart?"

665
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:14,075
But then I figured it out.
They did it because...

666
00:46:14,155 --> 00:46:17,836
...they figured young Norville for
an imbecile, like some other people I know.

667
00:46:18,316 --> 00:46:21,355
Why on earth would the board
want a nitwit to be president?

668
00:46:21,555 --> 00:46:25,476
Because they're little piglets.
They're trying to inspire panic...

669
00:46:26,077 --> 00:46:29,398
...make that stock cheap so they can
snatch it all up for themselves.

670
00:46:29,598 --> 00:46:32,918
But Norville's got some tricks
up his sleeve. He does.

671
00:46:33,558 --> 00:46:34,959
"You know, for kids?"

672
00:46:36,758 --> 00:46:39,439
Yeah, he's a smart one, that Norville.

673
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:44,920
But I guess you don't really know him
any better than that board does, do you?

674
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:46,520
Maybe l...

675
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:50,962
And only some kind of knuckle-head thinks
she knows things about things....

676
00:46:52,161 --> 00:46:53,682
When she don't....

677
00:46:54,882 --> 00:46:56,082
How'd that go?

678
00:46:56,282 --> 00:46:58,042
Well, it's hardly the same.

679
00:46:58,322 --> 00:47:00,443
You don't even know your own self.

680
00:47:00,803 --> 00:47:04,244
You ain't exactly the genuine article,
are you, Miss Archer?

681
00:47:04,564 --> 00:47:09,364
In connection with my job, sometimes
I have to go undercover, as it were.

682
00:47:09,444 --> 00:47:10,884
I don't mean that.

683
00:47:11,204 --> 00:47:14,885
Why are you pretending to be
such a hard old sourpuss?

684
00:47:15,485 --> 00:47:17,526
Ain't going to never make you happy!

685
00:47:19,446 --> 00:47:21,006
I'm happy enough.

686
00:47:26,727 --> 00:47:28,527
I got gears to see to.

687
00:47:33,208 --> 00:47:34,648
I'm plenty happy!

688
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:46,130
I can't print that!

689
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:49,851
Why not? It's true. The board's using him
to depress the stock and buy it cheap.

690
00:47:49,891 --> 00:47:52,731
It's pure speculation!
They'd have my butt in a satchel!

691
00:47:53,691 --> 00:47:55,132
They'll buy that stock...

692
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:58,652
You don't know anything. They haven't
bought it. What are they waiting for?

693
00:47:58,692 --> 00:47:59,372
I don't know.

694
00:47:59,452 --> 00:48:01,733
Amy's hunches are usually pretty good.

695
00:48:01,773 --> 00:48:04,454
You don't accuse somebody
of stock manipulation on a hunch!

696
00:48:04,494 --> 00:48:07,295
Our readers aren't interested
in sensationalism, gossip...

697
00:48:07,335 --> 00:48:08,654
...unsupported speculation!

698
00:48:08,734 --> 00:48:11,614
Facts! Figures! Those are the tools
of the newspaper trade.

699
00:48:11,694 --> 00:48:15,255
It's as if you're trying to take the heat
off him. Like you've gone soft on him.

700
00:48:15,335 --> 00:48:17,375
Come on, Chief. That's a low blow.

701
00:48:17,455 --> 00:48:20,136
Archer's not going to go gooey
for a corn-fed idiot.

702
00:48:20,176 --> 00:48:23,495
I was out of line. But you're out of line
with this stock-swindle story.

703
00:48:23,535 --> 00:48:26,016
Give me more of that
"moron from Sheboygan" stuff.

704
00:48:26,096 --> 00:48:27,216
-Muncie.
-Whatever.

705
00:48:27,296 --> 00:48:28,897
That's what sells newspapers!

706
00:48:28,937 --> 00:48:31,538
I've got a harder story:
"The Sap From The City Desk! "

707
00:48:31,618 --> 00:48:34,018
-Watch it!
-It's about a dim-witted editor who...

708
00:48:34,098 --> 00:48:35,378
Easy, tough guy.

709
00:48:38,578 --> 00:48:40,619
Does this suit look mannish to you?

710
00:48:40,739 --> 00:48:42,779
Yeah, sure. Let's grab a highball.

711
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:44,740
Back off!

712
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:46,260
Smoocher!

713
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:50,141
What gives?

714
00:49:05,344 --> 00:49:08,225
A man of great managerial potency.

715
00:49:08,785 --> 00:49:11,024
My husband is also a president.

716
00:49:11,184 --> 00:49:14,385
Sears Braithwaite of Bullard.
Do you know him?

717
00:49:14,665 --> 00:49:16,705
Your companion is an ode!

718
00:49:16,865 --> 00:49:19,385
A lyric! Are you betrothed?

719
00:49:19,506 --> 00:49:21,906
Amy works in my office. She runs...

720
00:49:21,986 --> 00:49:24,065
Oh, the folly of youth!

721
00:49:24,225 --> 00:49:26,146
Those green remembered hills!

722
00:49:26,226 --> 00:49:29,347
That bourn from which no traveler returns.

723
00:49:29,827 --> 00:49:32,068
I once ran the mimeograph for Sidney.

724
00:49:32,228 --> 00:49:35,188
Though engaged at the time
to quelqu'un d'autre...

725
00:49:35,588 --> 00:49:38,789
...my water-cooler romance
became a mad passion.

726
00:49:39,189 --> 00:49:41,989
Un amour fou. Une folie à deux.

727
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:46,750
I'm brushing up on my French
with the most charming man...

728
00:49:46,830 --> 00:49:50,351
-...Pierre of 5th Avenue. Do you know him?
-Do you know him?

729
00:49:50,391 --> 00:49:54,871
Sidney and I are planning a trip
to Paris and points continental.

730
00:49:58,072 --> 00:49:59,192
Aren't we, dear?

731
00:50:00,072 --> 00:50:03,673
Sure. I'd like to borrow Norville
for a while, if you don't mind.

732
00:50:05,194 --> 00:50:06,794
Well, frankly, I....

733
00:50:07,114 --> 00:50:09,755
You have a very charming wife, Mr.... Sid.

734
00:50:09,914 --> 00:50:11,194
So they tell me.

735
00:50:11,834 --> 00:50:14,875
Let me shepherd you
through some of the introductions here.

736
00:50:15,035 --> 00:50:16,955
Try not to talk too much.

737
00:50:17,435 --> 00:50:19,515
Some of our biggest stockholders are....

738
00:50:20,235 --> 00:50:21,796
Scratch that. Say whatever you like.

739
00:50:21,876 --> 00:50:24,556
Shake hands with
Sears Braithwaite of Bullard.

740
00:50:24,876 --> 00:50:26,435
Glad to know you, Barnes.

741
00:50:26,796 --> 00:50:28,516
This is Zebulon Cardozo...

742
00:50:28,596 --> 00:50:31,597
...one of Hudsucker's largest
and most loyal stockholders.

743
00:50:31,677 --> 00:50:33,998
What's this I hear
about you being an imbecile?

744
00:50:34,078 --> 00:50:35,638
What's ailing you, boy?

745
00:50:35,798 --> 00:50:39,759
Last week, my stock was worth twice
what it is now. I think I'll sell...

746
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:43,719
...the whole kit and caboodle, boy,
unless I see a vast improvement.

747
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:46,560
What you've got here, son, is a range war!

748
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:50,440
You gonna have to circle our wagons
or I'm gonna get out of your wagon train.

749
00:50:51,961 --> 00:50:54,042
No need for concern, sir.
It's only natural...

750
00:50:54,162 --> 00:50:57,242
...in a period of transition for the more
timid elements to run for cover.

751
00:50:57,282 --> 00:51:00,202
Yellow? I'll show you yellow, boy!

752
00:51:00,922 --> 00:51:03,803
You mind now and quit acting
like such an old grizzly.

753
00:51:04,003 --> 00:51:05,803
Step lively here, Norville.

754
00:51:06,324 --> 00:51:09,405
I'm sorry, I thought maybe if I showed him
the long view...

755
00:51:09,645 --> 00:51:12,324
And this is Thorstensen Finlandson...

756
00:51:12,564 --> 00:51:15,204
...who heads a radical, splinter group
of disgruntled investors.

757
00:51:15,284 --> 00:51:16,645
Pleased to meet you.

758
00:51:16,725 --> 00:51:20,125
It might interest you to know I studied
a little Finnish in high school.

759
00:51:20,165 --> 00:51:21,766
I hope I'm not too rusty.

760
00:51:29,206 --> 00:51:32,607
Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished
members of the Hudsucker Board...

761
00:51:32,647 --> 00:51:36,728
...I give you the Rajah of Romance,
the Ministereo of Moonlight...

762
00:51:37,088 --> 00:51:39,368
...the incredible, the unforgettable...

763
00:51:39,448 --> 00:51:42,248
...Mr. Vic Tenetta!

764
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:50,370
"Rajah". I like that.

765
00:52:31,697 --> 00:52:33,057
What happened?

766
00:52:34,417 --> 00:52:38,738
Nothing. Just the more timid investors
are no longer running for cover.

767
00:52:38,898 --> 00:52:39,978
Let me look.

768
00:52:40,578 --> 00:52:41,899
Sid found me the ice pack.

769
00:52:41,939 --> 00:52:44,539
Let me hold it or you'll have a real shiner.

770
00:52:45,899 --> 00:52:48,540
I guess people are pretty hot
over this imbecile story.

771
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:50,420
I'm sorry.

772
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:54,901
It's not your fault. You've the one person
standing by me through all this.

773
00:52:54,981 --> 00:52:57,661
Norville, there's something
I have to tell you.

774
00:52:58,581 --> 00:52:59,622
You see...

775
00:53:00,262 --> 00:53:02,142
...I'm not really a secretary.

776
00:53:03,062 --> 00:53:04,182
I know that, Amy.

777
00:53:04,262 --> 00:53:05,223
You do?

778
00:53:05,423 --> 00:53:08,424
I understand you're not very skilled yet
in the secretarial arts...

779
00:53:08,504 --> 00:53:11,505
...but I'll tell you a secret:
I'm not that skilled as president.

780
00:53:11,545 --> 00:53:14,864
-I know I put up a big front, but...
-I believe in you, Norville.

781
00:53:16,464 --> 00:53:17,505
At least...

782
00:53:18,025 --> 00:53:20,345
...I believe in your intentions.

783
00:53:20,585 --> 00:53:23,906
I don't blame them, really.
I suppose I have made a mess of things.

784
00:53:24,506 --> 00:53:26,706
Those folks have to protect
their investment.

785
00:53:26,746 --> 00:53:28,305
Most of them are very nice people.

786
00:53:28,345 --> 00:53:31,666
Listen, you can't trust people here
like you did in Muncie.

787
00:53:31,706 --> 00:53:33,707
Certain people are...

788
00:53:33,787 --> 00:53:37,588
Did you ever go to the top of Larson's
feed tower and look out over the town?

789
00:53:38,508 --> 00:53:39,828
On Farm Route 17?

790
00:53:40,188 --> 00:53:42,549
Oh, yes, in Muncie.

791
00:53:43,708 --> 00:53:46,269
No, Vidalia. Farm Route 17.

792
00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:51,190
Seventeen. Yes, I....
Well, no, no. I never really...

793
00:53:52,910 --> 00:53:56,511
The guys from the Varsity Squad
would bring their dates up there...

794
00:53:57,552 --> 00:53:58,831
...to hold hands.

795
00:53:59,631 --> 00:54:01,792
Of course, I never made Varsity.

796
00:54:04,352 --> 00:54:06,113
There's a place I go now.

797
00:54:06,913 --> 00:54:09,834
Cutest little place near my apartment
in Greenwich Village.

798
00:54:09,914 --> 00:54:11,794
It's called "Ann's 440".

799
00:54:12,115 --> 00:54:13,475
It's a beatnik bar.

800
00:54:13,555 --> 00:54:14,914
-You don't say?
-Yes.

801
00:54:14,994 --> 00:54:15,954
A beatnik bar.

802
00:54:16,034 --> 00:54:19,395
You can get carrot juice or ltalian coffee
and the people there...

803
00:54:19,995 --> 00:54:21,635
Well, none of them quite fit in.

804
00:54:22,235 --> 00:54:23,395
You'd love it.

805
00:54:23,875 --> 00:54:25,276
Come there with me.

806
00:54:25,756 --> 00:54:28,516
There's a marathon poetry-reading
on New Year's Eve. I go every year.

807
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:30,756
-It's marvelous!
-Every year?

808
00:54:32,836 --> 00:54:37,078
Well, this year, if it's good,
I plan to make it a tradition.

809
00:54:39,238 --> 00:54:41,118
My, it certainly is beautiful.

810
00:54:41,878 --> 00:54:43,359
The people...

811
00:54:43,799 --> 00:54:45,278
...look like ants.

812
00:54:46,399 --> 00:54:49,440
The Hindus, and the beatniks also,
say that...

813
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:52,640
...in our next lives some of us
will come back as ants.

814
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:57,081
Some will be butterflies, others will be
elephants or creatures of the sea.

815
00:54:57,241 --> 00:54:58,642
What a beautiful thought.

816
00:54:58,802 --> 00:55:01,402
What do you think you were
in a previous life?

817
00:55:02,442 --> 00:55:04,002
Oh, I don't know.

818
00:55:04,762 --> 00:55:06,202
Maybe I was just...

819
00:55:06,602 --> 00:55:10,564
...a fast-talking career gal
who thought she was one of the boys.

820
00:55:10,684 --> 00:55:11,804
Oh, no, Amy.

821
00:55:12,044 --> 00:55:14,804
Pardon me for saying so,
but I find that very far-fetched.

822
00:55:14,924 --> 00:55:18,764
-There really is something I must tell you.
-That person would come back as a hog.

823
00:55:18,844 --> 00:55:21,445
I find it more likely that you were...

824
00:55:22,765 --> 00:55:23,765
...a gazelle...

825
00:55:24,685 --> 00:55:28,166
...with long, graceful legs,
gamboling through the underbrush.

826
00:55:29,006 --> 00:55:30,565
Perhaps we met once.

827
00:55:31,245 --> 00:55:33,846
A chance encounter in a forest glade.

828
00:55:35,727 --> 00:55:38,168
I must have been an antelope or an ibex.

829
00:55:39,328 --> 00:55:42,728
The times we must've had
foraging together for sustenance...

830
00:55:43,649 --> 00:55:46,128
...snorfling water
from a mountain stream...

831
00:55:46,689 --> 00:55:50,130
...picking the grubs and burrs
from one another's coats.

832
00:55:52,770 --> 00:55:57,131
Or perhaps we simply touched horns
briefly and went our separate ways.

833
00:55:58,411 --> 00:56:00,931
Oh, I wish it were that simple, Norville.

834
00:56:02,292 --> 00:56:06,332
I wish I was still a gazelle
and you were an antelope...

835
00:56:07,172 --> 00:56:08,453
...or an ibex.

836
00:56:12,854 --> 00:56:14,415
Can I at least call you...

837
00:56:14,735 --> 00:56:15,734
...deer?

838
00:56:18,774 --> 00:56:19,854
You're funny.

839
00:56:19,894 --> 00:56:23,055
Seriously, Amy, it's what
your beatnik friends call "karma".

840
00:56:23,255 --> 00:56:24,055
Karma.

841
00:56:24,135 --> 00:56:26,976
The great circle of life, death and rebirth.

842
00:56:27,136 --> 00:56:30,696
I think I heard of that.
What goes around comes around.

843
00:56:30,776 --> 00:56:34,176
That's it. A great wheel
that gives us all what we deserve.

844
00:56:35,497 --> 00:56:38,578
I've go to show Sid and all the guys
I deserve their confidence.

845
00:56:38,658 --> 00:56:41,018
Tomorrow's my big presentation
to the board.

846
00:56:43,418 --> 00:56:44,619
Kiss me, Amy!

847
00:56:44,979 --> 00:56:46,458
Kiss me once for luck.

848
00:56:47,819 --> 00:56:49,019
Sure, Norville.

849
00:57:28,786 --> 00:57:30,106
You know, for kids!

850
00:57:30,386 --> 00:57:34,106
It has economy, simplicity, low
production cost, potential for mass appeal.

851
00:57:34,146 --> 00:57:36,387
All that spells out great profitability.

852
00:57:36,427 --> 00:57:39,067
I had the boys at R&D
make this prototype...

853
00:57:39,107 --> 00:57:41,028
...so our discussion
could have some focus...

854
00:57:41,068 --> 00:57:44,828
...and to give you gentleman a firsthand
look at how exciting this gizmo is.

855
00:57:44,868 --> 00:57:48,148
It's fun, healthy, good exercise,
and the kids'll love it.

856
00:57:48,268 --> 00:57:51,229
We put a little sand inside
to make the experience more pleasant.

857
00:57:51,269 --> 00:57:54,470
The great part is we don't have
to charge an arm and a leg.

858
00:57:57,030 --> 00:57:59,751
-What if you tire before it's done?
-Does it have rules?

859
00:57:59,831 --> 00:58:01,912
-Can more than one play?
-Why is it a game?

860
00:58:01,992 --> 00:58:03,511
-Is it a game?
-Will it break?

861
00:58:03,591 --> 00:58:05,672
-It better break eventually.
-Is there an object?

862
00:58:05,752 --> 00:58:08,312
-What if you tire before it's done?
-Does it have batteries?

863
00:58:08,392 --> 00:58:11,113
-Could we charge extra for them?
-Is it safe for toddlers?

864
00:58:11,193 --> 00:58:13,514
-How do you know you're finished?
-How does it stop?

865
00:58:13,554 --> 00:58:16,075
-Is that a boy's model?
-Can a parent assemble it?

866
00:58:16,195 --> 00:58:20,234
-What if you tire before it's done?
-Is there a larger model for the obese?

867
00:58:20,314 --> 00:58:22,435
What the hell is it?

868
00:58:22,475 --> 00:58:23,755
Well, it's....

869
00:58:27,435 --> 00:58:28,476
Brilliant!

870
00:58:30,316 --> 00:58:31,356
Genius.

871
00:58:32,396 --> 00:58:35,756
It's exactly what Hudsucker Industry needs
at this juncture.

872
00:58:36,636 --> 00:58:40,918
Even a blind man can tell you
there'll be an enormous demand for this...

873
00:58:42,318 --> 00:58:43,358
...this....

874
00:58:44,238 --> 00:58:45,238
Congratulations.

875
00:58:45,318 --> 00:58:47,719
You've outdone yourself.
You've reinvented the wheel.

876
00:58:47,799 --> 00:58:50,639
I'll recommend to the board
that we proceed immediately...

877
00:58:52,279 --> 00:58:53,600
...and that the...

878
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:57,880
...dingus be mass-produced
with all deliberate speed.

879
00:58:58,280 --> 00:58:59,961
Although, you realize...

880
00:59:00,401 --> 00:59:01,641
...of course...

881
00:59:04,721 --> 00:59:06,002
...as president...

882
00:59:06,322 --> 00:59:08,242
...the ultimate decision is yours.

883
00:59:09,402 --> 00:59:10,602
I'm for it.

884
00:59:57,370 --> 00:59:58,650
The Flying Doughnut!

885
00:59:58,690 --> 01:00:00,971
-The Dancing Dingus!
-The Belly-Go-Round.

886
01:00:01,051 --> 01:00:02,251
The Swingerina!

887
01:00:02,331 --> 01:00:03,732
The Wacky Circumference!

888
01:00:03,772 --> 01:00:05,531
Uncle Midriff!

889
01:00:35,095 --> 01:00:36,816
-We need something short!
-Sharp!

890
01:00:36,896 --> 01:00:37,576
Snappy!

891
01:00:37,656 --> 01:00:40,017
-With a little jazz!
-The Shazzammeter!

892
01:00:40,097 --> 01:00:42,217
-The Hipster!
-The Daddy-O!

893
01:01:21,824 --> 01:01:23,424
-The Hoopsucker.
-The Hudswinger.

894
01:01:23,504 --> 01:01:25,665
-The Hoopsucker!
-The Hudswinger!

895
01:01:25,705 --> 01:01:27,385
-The Hoopsucker!
-The Hudswinger!

896
01:01:54,349 --> 01:01:56,390
-Fellas!
-You got something?

897
01:01:58,030 --> 01:01:59,750
I got something!

898
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:08,022
Rockwell News presents: Tidbits of Time.

899
01:05:08,382 --> 01:05:10,982
World news in pictures, we kid you not!

900
01:05:11,342 --> 01:05:14,462
As Old Man 1958 hobbles
towards his finish...

901
01:05:15,022 --> 01:05:17,343
...Barnes is the name
on every American lip.

902
01:05:17,503 --> 01:05:20,904
Norville Barnes, young president
of Hudsucker Industries...

903
01:05:20,944 --> 01:05:24,464
...a boy bred in the heartland,
but now the toast of New York.

904
01:05:24,944 --> 01:05:29,265
Barnes is the brainy inventor of America's
craziest craze: The Hula Hoop!

905
01:05:29,785 --> 01:05:33,345
Reaping huge profits for his company
and winning the hearts...

906
01:05:33,625 --> 01:05:36,066
...and hips of every youngster in America!

907
01:05:37,466 --> 01:05:38,866
Did I say youngster?

908
01:05:39,106 --> 01:05:41,986
Here's Mom taking a break
from her household chores...

909
01:05:42,706 --> 01:05:45,067
...and even Dad is swinging into the act!

910
01:05:46,627 --> 01:05:51,228
Cards, letters, congratulations come
pouring in from Kankakee to Petaluma...

911
01:05:51,588 --> 01:05:54,669
...including one very special
long-distance call.

912
01:05:54,908 --> 01:05:56,789
He's on! He's on the line!

913
01:06:03,190 --> 01:06:05,390
Hello, Norville. This is the President.

914
01:06:05,831 --> 01:06:09,192
I just wanted to congratulate you.
I'm very proud of you.

915
01:06:09,792 --> 01:06:12,072
Mrs. Eisenhower is very proud of you.

916
01:06:12,432 --> 01:06:14,872
The American people are very proud of you.

917
01:06:21,674 --> 01:06:24,555
How'd you come up with the idea
for the Hula Hoop?

918
01:06:24,915 --> 01:06:26,754
It was no great idea, really.

919
01:06:26,874 --> 01:06:30,475
A thing like this takes a whole company
to put together. I'm grateful.

920
01:06:30,755 --> 01:06:33,555
Did you have any idea
there'd be such a huge response?

921
01:06:33,595 --> 01:06:36,596
Frankly, I don't think anybody
expected this much hoopla.

922
01:06:38,396 --> 01:06:41,715
"Hoopla on the Hula Hoop".
Can we quote you on that, Mr. Barnes?

923
01:06:41,835 --> 01:06:43,196
Sure, I guess.

924
01:06:43,876 --> 01:06:46,157
Will you give yourself a nice, fat raise?

925
01:06:47,357 --> 01:06:48,518
Come on, you guys.

926
01:06:55,838 --> 01:07:00,400
What scientific principle explains
the motion of this wheel of wonder?

927
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:02,520
The dingus is quite simple, really.

928
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:06,801
It operates on the same principles that
keep the earth spinning around the sun...

929
01:07:06,881 --> 01:07:11,161
...and that keeps you from flying off
the earth into the cold reaches of space...

930
01:07:11,281 --> 01:07:13,722
...where you would die
like a miserable Schwein.

931
01:07:13,762 --> 01:07:15,802
Yes, the principle is the same...

932
01:07:16,242 --> 01:07:20,283
...except for the piece of grit
they put in to make the experience...

933
01:07:21,003 --> 01:07:22,124
...more pleasant.

934
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:24,805
Yes, it's hula-hula everywhere!

935
01:07:24,885 --> 01:07:27,524
From the parties of the Park Avenue
smart set...

936
01:07:30,564 --> 01:07:34,085
...to sweethearts who want
to be married in the swing of things.

937
01:07:38,286 --> 01:07:41,525
Did the board consider you an "Idea Man"
when they promoted you?

938
01:07:41,605 --> 01:07:45,006
I guess. I don't think they promoted me
because they thought I was a schmo.

939
01:07:45,086 --> 01:07:48,247
What's the next big idea for you
and Hudsucker Industries?

940
01:07:48,327 --> 01:07:51,568
I don't know. An idea like this sweet baby
doesn't just come overnight.

941
01:07:51,648 --> 01:07:55,729
Although, I'll tell you one thing:
I certainly didn't expect all this hoopla.

942
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:58,008
You can quote me on that.

943
01:08:05,330 --> 01:08:08,411
Rumpus Magazine has called you
the most eligible bachelor of the year.

944
01:08:08,491 --> 01:08:11,492
And society pages have been linking you
with fashion model Za-Za.

945
01:08:11,532 --> 01:08:15,412
There's no truth to the rumors.
We're just dear friends. Isn't that right?

946
01:08:22,293 --> 01:08:26,375
How do you respond to the charges that
you're out of ideas? Have you run dry?

947
01:08:26,535 --> 01:08:30,334
Not at all. Just this week I came up
with several new sweet ideas.

948
01:08:30,694 --> 01:08:34,935
A larger model Hula Hoop for the portly,
a battery option for the lazy or spastic.

949
01:08:35,055 --> 01:08:37,335
A model with extra sand
for the hard-of-hearing.

950
01:08:37,415 --> 01:08:39,016
I'm earning my keep.

951
01:08:39,056 --> 01:08:41,616
Speaking of that,
do you expect to get a raise?

952
01:08:41,936 --> 01:08:45,816
By anyone's account I single-handedly
have saved Hudsucker Industries.

953
01:08:45,936 --> 01:08:50,338
Our stock is worth more now than ever.
Yes, I expect to be compensated for that.

954
01:09:09,421 --> 01:09:11,141
Pull yourself together, man.

955
01:09:11,221 --> 01:09:12,622
Nobody told me!

956
01:09:13,541 --> 01:09:15,702
You sold all our stock?

957
01:09:16,142 --> 01:09:17,662
We dumped the whole load.

958
01:09:17,742 --> 01:09:20,022
I had 20,000 shares!

959
01:09:20,703 --> 01:09:22,343
I'd be a millionaire now!

960
01:09:22,423 --> 01:09:24,424
Sure. We'd all be millionaires.

961
01:09:25,104 --> 01:09:27,105
There's no point in looking back.

962
01:09:27,825 --> 01:09:31,584
At the time, Stillson thought that dumping
our position would panic the market...

963
01:09:31,664 --> 01:09:33,585
...further depress the stock.

964
01:09:33,825 --> 01:09:37,225
Then we could buy it back and more,
of course, once it got cheap.

965
01:09:37,305 --> 01:09:38,225
Cheap?

966
01:09:38,625 --> 01:09:40,466
It's never been more valuable!

967
01:09:42,306 --> 01:09:43,505
And I'm ruined.

968
01:09:44,225 --> 01:09:45,186
Ruined!

969
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:55,268
I'm getting off this merry-go-round!

970
01:10:04,990 --> 01:10:06,070
Plexiglass.

971
01:10:06,630 --> 01:10:08,310
Had it installed last week.

972
01:10:21,673 --> 01:10:23,313
So, the kid caught a wave.

973
01:10:24,954 --> 01:10:28,315
Right now, he and his dingus are on top.

974
01:10:28,875 --> 01:10:30,554
Well, this too shall pass.

975
01:10:31,434 --> 01:10:34,435
Myrtle J. Mussburger
did not raise her boy to go...

976
01:10:34,955 --> 01:10:37,595
...knock-kneed at the first sign of adversity.

977
01:10:37,635 --> 01:10:40,436
I say, we made this chump,
we can break him!

978
01:10:41,276 --> 01:10:43,956
I say, the higher he climbs,
the harder he drops!

979
01:10:45,755 --> 01:10:46,796
I say, yes...

980
01:10:47,676 --> 01:10:49,277
...the kid has a future...

981
01:10:50,637 --> 01:10:51,837
...and in it...

982
01:10:52,798 --> 01:10:54,718
...I see shame, dishonor...

983
01:10:55,358 --> 01:10:57,078
...ignominy, disgrace.

984
01:11:00,878 --> 01:11:03,039
The music plays, the wheel turns...

985
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:06,200
...and our spin ain't over yet.

986
01:11:29,925 --> 01:11:31,844
For Pete's sakes, Norville!

987
01:11:32,204 --> 01:11:34,004
Where have you been hiding?

988
01:11:34,164 --> 01:11:37,365
Do you know what those nincompoops
in the boardroom are doing?

989
01:11:37,445 --> 01:11:39,005
I wouldn't call them nincompoops.

990
01:11:39,085 --> 01:11:41,446
They're going to discharge 8%
of the workforce here!

991
01:11:41,526 --> 01:11:44,366
In New York City alone,
that means 1,800 people out of work!

992
01:11:44,446 --> 01:11:46,765
People with wives, children and families!

993
01:11:47,046 --> 01:11:49,126
We're pruning away some of the dead wood.

994
01:11:49,206 --> 01:11:51,207
You mean you know about this?

995
01:11:51,247 --> 01:11:52,767
Know about it? Sure.

996
01:11:52,847 --> 01:11:55,848
You think the board would do anything
without my authorization?

997
01:11:55,928 --> 01:11:57,328
It was my idea.

998
01:11:57,408 --> 01:11:58,688
-Your...
-Sure it was.

999
01:11:58,768 --> 01:12:01,568
We're in a period of transition.
Things have slowed down.

1000
01:12:01,648 --> 01:12:04,329
You're being awfully kind to yourself,
Norville Barnes.

1001
01:12:04,369 --> 01:12:07,690
You've slowed down, sitting up here
not doing a lick of work.

1002
01:12:08,210 --> 01:12:12,891
You haven't come up with an idea since
the Hoop and the reason is plain to see!

1003
01:12:12,971 --> 01:12:15,372
You've forgotten what made your ideas
exciting to you.

1004
01:12:15,452 --> 01:12:17,732
It wasn't for the fame and wealth....

1005
01:12:17,812 --> 01:12:21,492
Would you get out of here?
You too, sisters, move it. Out!

1006
01:12:23,653 --> 01:12:26,694
I've been watching you, even though
you've been trying to avoid me.

1007
01:12:26,854 --> 01:12:27,534
Shut up!

1008
01:12:27,574 --> 01:12:29,815
Don't think I haven't noticed
how you've changed.

1009
01:12:29,855 --> 01:12:31,574
I used to think you were a swell guy.

1010
01:12:31,654 --> 01:12:33,614
To be honest,
I thought you were an imbecile.

1011
01:12:34,014 --> 01:12:34,774
Shut up!

1012
01:12:34,854 --> 01:12:38,295
Then I figured out you were a swell guy.
A little slow maybe, but a swell guy.

1013
01:12:38,375 --> 01:12:41,695
Maybe you're not so slow
but you're not so swell either.

1014
01:12:41,776 --> 01:12:43,896
Looks like you're an imbecile, after all.
Shut up!

1015
01:12:44,576 --> 01:12:47,896
You haven't talked to me for a week
and now I'm going to say my piece.

1016
01:12:47,936 --> 01:12:49,896
Look, I've never been...

1017
01:12:50,816 --> 01:12:53,297
...dumped by a fella before,
and that hurts...

1018
01:12:53,657 --> 01:12:56,418
...but what really hurts is watching you
out-run your soul!

1019
01:12:56,498 --> 01:12:58,778
Chasing after money and ease
and the respect of a board...

1020
01:12:58,858 --> 01:13:01,139
...that wouldn't give you the time of day...

1021
01:13:01,179 --> 01:13:02,138
...if you....

1022
01:13:02,698 --> 01:13:04,059
Worked in a watch factory?

1023
01:13:05,539 --> 01:13:06,860
Shut up! Exactly.

1024
01:13:08,060 --> 01:13:11,460
Norville, don't you remember
how you used to feel about the Hoop?

1025
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:15,462
You told me you'd bring a smile
to the hips of everyone in America...

1026
01:13:15,542 --> 01:13:17,421
...regardless of race, creed or color.

1027
01:13:17,501 --> 01:13:20,982
Finally, there'd be a thingamajig
that would bring everyone together...

1028
01:13:21,022 --> 01:13:23,262
...even if it kept them apart spatially.

1029
01:13:23,702 --> 01:13:24,743
"You know...

1030
01:13:25,223 --> 01:13:26,223
"...for kids".

1031
01:13:27,063 --> 01:13:28,024
Your words...

1032
01:13:29,064 --> 01:13:30,144
...not mine.

1033
01:13:31,465 --> 01:13:33,064
I used to love Norville Barnes.

1034
01:13:34,104 --> 01:13:35,424
Yes, love him...

1035
01:13:36,104 --> 01:13:39,985
...when he was just a swell kid
with hot ideas who was in over his head.

1036
01:13:40,705 --> 01:13:42,906
Now your head's too big to be in over!

1037
01:13:43,026 --> 01:13:44,866
Consider this my resignation.

1038
01:13:46,106 --> 01:13:47,505
Effective immediately!

1039
01:15:04,278 --> 01:15:05,999
Buddy, buddy.

1040
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:07,879
Buddy.

1041
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:10,040
Oh, buddy.

1042
01:15:19,441 --> 01:15:20,722
Buddy. You busy?

1043
01:15:22,482 --> 01:15:25,802
Looks like you nodded off there, buddy.
Say, you got a minute?

1044
01:15:29,243 --> 01:15:30,564
Is this important?

1045
01:15:30,644 --> 01:15:33,805
I think so. It's this little idea
I've been working on.

1046
01:15:33,845 --> 01:15:36,444
You see, I don't intend
to be an elevator boy forever.

1047
01:15:36,524 --> 01:15:38,044
Take a look at this sweet baby!

1048
01:15:38,124 --> 01:15:40,445
Get it? Incredibly convenient, isn't it?

1049
01:15:40,565 --> 01:15:42,045
You know, for drinks?

1050
01:15:42,245 --> 01:15:46,046
This is how it works. It's got these ridges
on the side that give it its whammy.

1051
01:15:46,166 --> 01:15:49,645
You don't have to drink like this.
You can drink like this.

1052
01:15:49,765 --> 01:15:51,966
I call it the "Buzz-Sucker".
You get it, buddy?

1053
01:15:52,046 --> 01:15:55,767
People are dying for this and
we won't have to charge an arm and a leg.

1054
01:15:55,807 --> 01:15:57,008
Wait a minute.

1055
01:16:11,730 --> 01:16:12,690
This...

1056
01:16:15,651 --> 01:16:16,771
...is worthless!

1057
01:16:17,051 --> 01:16:18,131
But, buddy!

1058
01:16:18,452 --> 01:16:21,252
This is the most idiotic thing
I've ever seen in my life.

1059
01:16:21,332 --> 01:16:23,572
Nobody wants a hair-brained product
like this.

1060
01:16:23,612 --> 01:16:24,692
You see, Buzz...

1061
01:16:24,772 --> 01:16:26,772
...it lacks the creative spark...

1062
01:16:27,132 --> 01:16:30,013
...the unalloyed genius
that made something like, say...

1063
01:16:30,814 --> 01:16:32,454
...the Hula Hoop such a success.

1064
01:16:32,534 --> 01:16:34,895
How dare you barge in here
and take up my valuable time!

1065
01:16:34,974 --> 01:16:36,294
I've got a company to run!

1066
01:16:38,534 --> 01:16:41,335
I can't have every deadbeat
on the payroll pestering me...

1067
01:16:41,375 --> 01:16:43,055
...with their idiotic brainwaves.

1068
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:44,295
I'm sorry, buddy.

1069
01:16:44,375 --> 01:16:45,535
An example must be made!

1070
01:16:46,016 --> 01:16:47,376
What do you mean?

1071
01:16:48,456 --> 01:16:49,576
You're fired!

1072
01:16:50,295 --> 01:16:52,296
Is that plain enough for you?

1073
01:16:57,417 --> 01:16:58,778
Oh, buddy!

1074
01:16:59,498 --> 01:17:01,098
And don't call me "buddy"!

1075
01:17:01,858 --> 01:17:05,738
Oh, please, sir! This job running
the elevator, it's all I got!

1076
01:17:06,178 --> 01:17:08,139
It's okay if you don't like the Buzz-Sucker!

1077
01:17:08,219 --> 01:17:10,900
Just let me keep my job,
I'm praying to you!

1078
01:17:11,740 --> 01:17:13,020
Get out of my office!

1079
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:14,740
Get up! Up!

1080
01:17:15,820 --> 01:17:18,301
We don't crawl here
at Hudsucker Industries!

1081
01:17:19,902 --> 01:17:21,141
I'm sorry, sir!

1082
01:17:21,301 --> 01:17:22,422
I'm sorry!

1083
01:17:36,304 --> 01:17:37,704
Thank you, Aloysius.

1084
01:17:42,625 --> 01:17:43,745
This is...

1085
01:17:45,505 --> 01:17:46,465
...useful.

1086
01:18:03,868 --> 01:18:07,949
I'm sorry I'm late, Sid. That back nine
at Riverdale's really murder.

1087
01:18:09,189 --> 01:18:11,950
It's a tough course. A real lollapalooza.

1088
01:18:13,430 --> 01:18:14,630
Sit down, son.

1089
01:18:17,871 --> 01:18:21,791
I thought the boardroom would be
a swell place to chat undisturbed.

1090
01:18:22,871 --> 01:18:26,112
Seems we've got some security problems
here at the Hud.

1091
01:18:27,192 --> 01:18:28,072
You don't say.

1092
01:18:28,112 --> 01:18:32,274
Ordinarily, I wouldn't bother you with it,
but this is embarrassing.

1093
01:18:33,594 --> 01:18:35,675
It concerns you directly.

1094
01:18:35,995 --> 01:18:38,474
-How's that?
-It's not serious in itself.

1095
01:18:39,114 --> 01:18:41,755
Some elevator boy that you'd fired
came to me...

1096
01:18:42,355 --> 01:18:45,995
...claiming that you'd stolen
the idea for the dingus.

1097
01:18:46,315 --> 01:18:47,916
You'd stolen it from him.

1098
01:18:50,956 --> 01:18:53,275
-Maybe I was a little rough on him...
-Forget it.

1099
01:18:53,355 --> 01:18:56,837
You don't have to explain to me.
He's a little person. He's nothing.

1100
01:18:56,917 --> 01:18:58,397
Fire whoever you want.

1101
01:19:00,318 --> 01:19:02,038
No, the problem is...

1102
01:19:02,678 --> 01:19:03,958
...who you hired.

1103
01:19:04,398 --> 01:19:05,438
That dame.

1104
01:19:05,879 --> 01:19:07,398
A spy, as it turns out.

1105
01:19:08,278 --> 01:19:10,959
She must have gotten
to that elevator schnook...

1106
01:19:11,679 --> 01:19:13,720
...and her paper is going to town.

1107
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:19,001
Sure, sure, we tried to kill the story,
but the Argus won't play ball.

1108
01:19:20,801 --> 01:19:23,841
The problem the board will have is
you hired this woman...

1109
01:19:24,202 --> 01:19:25,842
...and you kept her on...

1110
01:19:26,162 --> 01:19:28,562
...while she was making
a chump out of you.

1111
01:19:29,122 --> 01:19:30,803
Serious error in judgement.

1112
01:19:32,323 --> 01:19:33,804
Business is war, kid.

1113
01:19:34,884 --> 01:19:37,285
Take no prisoners, give no second chances.

1114
01:19:40,964 --> 01:19:43,325
When the board meets after New Year's...

1115
01:19:43,485 --> 01:19:44,925
...your position....

1116
01:19:47,525 --> 01:19:49,206
Looks like you're finished.

1117
01:19:49,926 --> 01:19:50,966
Washed up.

1118
01:19:56,486 --> 01:19:58,367
Fourteenth hole at Riverdale...

1119
01:19:58,727 --> 01:20:00,247
...some use a mashie...

1120
01:20:00,447 --> 01:20:01,888
...some use a niblick.

1121
01:20:02,848 --> 01:20:03,848
Niblick.

1122
01:20:04,408 --> 01:20:06,568
You get more loft, more backspin.

1123
01:20:11,289 --> 01:20:12,369
That dame...

1124
01:20:13,770 --> 01:20:16,050
...she got your throat pretty well slit.

1125
01:20:17,130 --> 01:20:19,051
When you're dead, you stay dead.

1126
01:20:19,891 --> 01:20:22,252
You don't believe me,
ask Waring Hudsucker.

1127
01:20:24,451 --> 01:20:25,732
Tough luck, kid.

1128
01:20:26,372 --> 01:20:28,012
You had a short climb up.

1129
01:20:29,092 --> 01:20:30,572
It's a long way down.

1130
01:20:42,774 --> 01:20:46,175
-You can't print that!
-We are! She hits the streets tonight.

1131
01:20:47,135 --> 01:20:48,775
And she's dynamite!

1132
01:20:48,855 --> 01:20:52,816
But it's the bunk! Norville showed me his
design for the whatsit the day I met him.

1133
01:20:52,896 --> 01:20:55,576
Buzz couldn't have invented it.
Look at him, he's an imbecile.

1134
01:20:55,656 --> 01:20:59,417
Aren't you a broken record?
Gunderson did design it. He's a prodigy.

1135
01:20:59,537 --> 01:21:01,898
-Says who?
-You're not the only one with sources.

1136
01:21:01,938 --> 01:21:04,458
Smith has a senior source
on the Hud Board. Very senior.

1137
01:21:04,698 --> 01:21:06,818
I bet his initials are Sidney J. Mussburger.

1138
01:21:07,538 --> 01:21:10,098
You lost it. You gone soft,
by the looks of it.

1139
01:21:10,178 --> 01:21:11,699
Soft on the dummy from Dubuque.

1140
01:21:12,699 --> 01:21:13,980
-Muncie.
-Whatever!

1141
01:21:14,060 --> 01:21:17,780
This story's hot and you're no longer
on top of it. It's the scoop of the century!

1142
01:21:17,860 --> 01:21:19,941
The other papers won't have this
till tomorrow!

1143
01:21:20,021 --> 01:21:23,782
Allemeinisher Zeitung, Le Figaro
will be choking on our dust come morning.

1144
01:21:23,822 --> 01:21:27,142
You're fools, both of you!
You're being used, don't you see?

1145
01:21:27,462 --> 01:21:30,262
Take a break. You worked hard on this.
You broke it for us.

1146
01:21:30,342 --> 01:21:32,663
But it's passed you by
and Smith's taking up the slack.

1147
01:21:34,863 --> 01:21:36,144
You want slack...

1148
01:21:36,744 --> 01:21:38,024
...I'll give you slack!

1149
01:21:38,064 --> 01:21:42,344
You're not putting me out to pasture!
I quit! Consider this my resignation!

1150
01:21:43,544 --> 01:21:45,065
Effective immediately!

1151
01:21:47,705 --> 01:21:48,665
Soft.

1152
01:21:57,666 --> 01:21:59,106
So, tell me...

1153
01:21:59,546 --> 01:22:02,067
...why do you feel this woman
betrayed you?

1154
01:22:04,348 --> 01:22:05,868
What's the difference?

1155
01:22:05,908 --> 01:22:08,588
The whole world, it seems, is against you?

1156
01:22:08,668 --> 01:22:09,869
I don't know.

1157
01:22:09,989 --> 01:22:11,668
Und the elevator boy...

1158
01:22:11,789 --> 01:22:14,830
...Buzz, he too works against you?

1159
01:22:16,990 --> 01:22:17,990
Classic.

1160
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:21,471
Patient displayed listlessness, apathy,
gloomy indifference...

1161
01:22:21,551 --> 01:22:23,311
...und was blue und mopey.

1162
01:22:23,791 --> 01:22:27,272
When asked what the Rorschach stains
represented, patient replied:

1163
01:22:27,352 --> 01:22:31,272
"Nothing much. I don't know.
Just a blotch. Sure beats me".

1164
01:22:31,992 --> 01:22:35,113
Patient shows no ambition,
no get-up-and-go, no vim.

1165
01:22:35,793 --> 01:22:37,994
He is riding the grand loopen-ze-loop...

1166
01:22:38,354 --> 01:22:41,194
...that goes from the height
of delusional gaiety...

1167
01:22:41,274 --> 01:22:42,994
...to the trough of despair.

1168
01:22:43,514 --> 01:22:46,195
He is now near,
but not yet at his lowest point.

1169
01:22:46,555 --> 01:22:50,835
When he reaches bottom, he may erupt
und pose a danger to himself...

1170
01:22:51,035 --> 01:22:51,996
...and others.

1171
01:22:52,196 --> 01:22:54,236
Diagnosis, Dr. Bromfenbrenner?

1172
01:22:54,476 --> 01:22:57,355
Patient is eine manic-depressive paranoid,
type B...

1173
01:22:57,516 --> 01:22:59,236
...with acute schizoid tendencies.

1174
01:22:59,596 --> 01:23:01,277
So, patient is...?

1175
01:23:02,877 --> 01:23:03,918
Precisely.

1176
01:23:04,558 --> 01:23:05,558
Nuts!

1177
01:23:05,998 --> 01:23:07,158
Prescription?

1178
01:23:07,358 --> 01:23:09,238
Three things: Commitment...

1179
01:23:09,799 --> 01:23:11,998
...electroconvulsive therapy...

1180
01:23:12,118 --> 01:23:14,479
...maintenance in eine secure facility.

1181
01:23:29,642 --> 01:23:31,762
Yeah, he's a tall guy. A real mess.

1182
01:23:33,482 --> 01:23:36,923
Look, you better get down here.
He says he's a friend of yours.

1183
01:23:37,083 --> 01:23:39,844
He didn't say.
But, man, is he from Squaresville.

1184
01:23:48,125 --> 01:23:49,445
I want a martini!

1185
01:23:50,045 --> 01:23:52,325
It's New Year's Eve. I deserve a martini.

1186
01:23:52,726 --> 01:23:54,446
It's like I've been telling you...

1187
01:23:54,526 --> 01:23:56,606
I thought you served misfits here!

1188
01:23:56,686 --> 01:23:59,126
That's a roger. But we don't sell alcohol.

1189
01:23:59,566 --> 01:24:01,927
What kind of bar doesn't serve martinis?

1190
01:24:02,167 --> 01:24:05,568
It's a juice-and-coffee bar, man,
like I've been telling you.

1191
01:24:05,768 --> 01:24:07,768
Right. So, I want...

1192
01:24:09,088 --> 01:24:10,208
...a martini.

1193
01:24:10,929 --> 01:24:13,889
I've had a martini in every bar
on the way down here.

1194
01:24:14,449 --> 01:24:16,409
Martinis are for squares, man.

1195
01:24:18,330 --> 01:24:21,010
What'd you call me, you beatnik son of a...

1196
01:24:26,892 --> 01:24:28,211
Look who's here:

1197
01:24:28,331 --> 01:24:29,572
Amy Archer...

1198
01:24:29,852 --> 01:24:31,452
...Prizeter Pule winner.

1199
01:24:32,092 --> 01:24:34,252
Looking for a nitwit to buy you lunch?

1200
01:24:35,173 --> 01:24:37,333
-Bar fella, I'd like...
-I'm sorry.

1201
01:24:38,013 --> 01:24:39,374
...a martini, please.

1202
01:24:39,414 --> 01:24:41,735
I tried to tell you so many times, I....

1203
01:24:43,094 --> 01:24:44,494
It's hard to admit...

1204
01:24:44,534 --> 01:24:46,294
...when you've been wrong.

1205
01:24:46,894 --> 01:24:48,295
If you could just...

1206
01:24:48,695 --> 01:24:50,455
...find it in your heart...

1207
01:24:51,055 --> 01:24:52,855
...to give me another chance.

1208
01:24:55,216 --> 01:24:57,576
"You take no prisoners,
give no second chances".

1209
01:24:57,656 --> 01:25:00,416
Please, Norville!
Please give me one more chance!

1210
01:25:01,136 --> 01:25:02,416
And yourself, too!

1211
01:25:02,577 --> 01:25:04,297
We both deserve one.

1212
01:25:04,537 --> 01:25:08,018
Just give us a second chance.
Together we can fight this thing.

1213
01:25:08,178 --> 01:25:12,139
I know the last story was a lie
and we can prove it. Release a statement!

1214
01:25:12,179 --> 01:25:15,059
-I can help you write it!
-What's the difference?

1215
01:25:15,699 --> 01:25:17,019
I'm all washed up.

1216
01:25:18,420 --> 01:25:19,340
Extinct.

1217
01:25:19,860 --> 01:25:21,860
Homo sapiens sapicus.

1218
01:25:24,661 --> 01:25:26,701
That just about does it.

1219
01:25:27,622 --> 01:25:30,822
I've seen Norville Barnes,
the young man in a big hurry...

1220
01:25:31,262 --> 01:25:34,382
...and I've seen Norville Barnes,
the self-important heel.

1221
01:25:34,702 --> 01:25:37,503
But I've never seen Norville Barnes,
the quitter...

1222
01:25:38,263 --> 01:25:39,824
...and I don't like it.

1223
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:42,945
"Fight on

1224
01:25:43,585 --> 01:25:46,344
"Fight on, dear old Muncie

1225
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:50,945
"Fight on
Hoist the gold and blue

1226
01:25:52,345 --> 01:25:55,266
"You'll be tattered, torn and hurting

1227
01:25:56,146 --> 01:25:59,465
"Once the Munce is done with you

1228
01:26:01,906 --> 01:26:03,427
"Go...

1229
01:26:03,547 --> 01:26:04,627
"...Eagles! "

1230
01:26:06,908 --> 01:26:09,908
You can't surrender, Norville! Remember:

1231
01:26:10,588 --> 01:26:11,948
"Fight on

1232
01:26:12,188 --> 01:26:13,589
"Fight on

1233
01:26:13,669 --> 01:26:15,989
"Dear old Muncie

1234
01:26:16,509 --> 01:26:17,789
"Fight on

1235
01:26:17,869 --> 01:26:21,270
"Hoist the gold and blue

1236
01:26:22,310 --> 01:26:24,390
"You'll be tattered, torn...

1237
01:26:24,470 --> 01:26:26,391
"...and hurting...".

1238
01:26:28,112 --> 01:26:29,312
You lied to me.

1239
01:26:30,071 --> 01:26:31,672
How could you lie to me?

1240
01:26:33,712 --> 01:26:34,672
You...

1241
01:26:35,352 --> 01:26:36,632
...a Muncie girl.

1242
01:26:38,473 --> 01:26:40,234
But, Norville, l...

1243
01:26:41,114 --> 01:26:43,034
"When you're dead, you stay dead! "

1244
01:26:43,635 --> 01:26:44,674
Just ask...

1245
01:26:44,754 --> 01:26:46,394
...Waring Hudsucker!

1246
01:26:53,395 --> 01:26:54,795
Extra, extra!

1247
01:26:54,915 --> 01:26:56,636
New Year's Eve edition!

1248
01:26:56,716 --> 01:26:59,076
Barnes' brain caught red-handed!

1249
01:26:59,196 --> 01:27:00,555
Ideas ersatz!

1250
01:27:00,995 --> 01:27:03,596
Man from Muncie a moron after all!

1251
01:27:03,956 --> 01:27:05,997
Read all about it!

1252
01:27:06,157 --> 01:27:10,318
New Year's Eve edition!
Man from Muncie a moron after all!

1253
01:27:10,478 --> 01:27:12,638
You're not so slow, but you're not so swell.

1254
01:27:12,678 --> 01:27:15,278
And it looks like you're an imbecile
after all.

1255
01:27:15,718 --> 01:27:17,959
But your friends called you "dope?"

1256
01:27:18,039 --> 01:27:20,160
"Dipstick?" "Lamebrain?" "Schmo?"

1257
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:23,280
Please, buddy, running the elevator,
it's all I got.

1258
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:25,400
Norville, you let me down.

1259
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:29,762
You let Mrs. Eisenhower down.
You let the American people down.

1260
01:27:29,842 --> 01:27:32,322
And when you're dead, you stay dead.

1261
01:27:35,562 --> 01:27:37,682
The kid is screwy, it's official.

1262
01:27:39,083 --> 01:27:41,884
The barred-window boys
are out looking for him now.

1263
01:27:42,364 --> 01:27:44,085
We'll see how Wall Street likes the news...

1264
01:27:44,165 --> 01:27:47,404
...that the president of Hudsucker
is heading for the booby hatch.

1265
01:27:49,044 --> 01:27:51,605
When Doc Bromfenbrenner gets through
with him...

1266
01:27:52,085 --> 01:27:53,965
...he'll need diapers and a dribble cup.

1267
01:27:56,286 --> 01:27:57,566
If that's all....

1268
01:27:57,846 --> 01:27:59,526
Long live the Hud!

1269
01:28:09,088 --> 01:28:10,368
Watch where you're...

1270
01:28:10,448 --> 01:28:12,008
Hiya, buddy!

1271
01:28:12,848 --> 01:28:14,969
Out on the town? Guess what?

1272
01:28:15,049 --> 01:28:17,809
Mr.... Sid says I can have my old job back!

1273
01:28:17,849 --> 01:28:19,729
I deserve a second chance, he says.

1274
01:28:19,929 --> 01:28:20,690
He did?

1275
01:28:20,770 --> 01:28:23,090
Turns out he's not such a bad guy after all.

1276
01:28:23,650 --> 01:28:25,050
That's wonderful.

1277
01:28:25,530 --> 01:28:28,971
He said you stole that swell hoop idea
from me. What gives?

1278
01:28:29,171 --> 01:28:30,372
I would never...

1279
01:28:30,452 --> 01:28:32,171
Gee, that was a swell idea.

1280
01:28:33,012 --> 01:28:34,692
And Sid says you stoled it!

1281
01:28:35,132 --> 01:28:37,492
What are you waiting for? Pop him one!

1282
01:28:47,614 --> 01:28:49,294
He's that big-shot faker!

1283
01:28:49,334 --> 01:28:51,095
That Wall Street fraud!

1284
01:28:51,215 --> 01:28:52,975
Nuttier than a fruitcake!

1285
01:28:54,295 --> 01:28:55,855
Somebody call the cops!

1286
01:29:26,260 --> 01:29:28,341
Ring out the old, ring in the new!

1287
01:33:59,305 --> 01:34:01,825
Strictly speaking, I'm never supposed
to do this...

1288
01:34:01,905 --> 01:34:03,826
...but have you got a better idea?

1289
01:35:09,196 --> 01:35:11,436
Love that tune. How you doing, kid?

1290
01:35:12,477 --> 01:35:13,757
Mr. Hudsucker?

1291
01:35:14,917 --> 01:35:17,598
How do you like that thing?
They're all wearing them upstairs.

1292
01:35:17,678 --> 01:35:18,718
It's a fad.

1293
01:35:18,958 --> 01:35:19,958
Anyway...

1294
01:35:20,438 --> 01:35:21,839
...I see you've been having some...

1295
01:35:21,919 --> 01:35:23,438
...problems with the board.

1296
01:35:23,598 --> 01:35:26,039
I guess Sidney's been putting
the screws to you, Norman.

1297
01:35:26,519 --> 01:35:27,680
Norville.

1298
01:35:28,040 --> 01:35:31,120
Say what you like about his ethics,
he's a balls-to-the-wall businessman.

1299
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:34,361
Beat you any way he can.
Straight for the jugular. Very effective.

1300
01:35:34,441 --> 01:35:37,522
Any particular reason you didn't give him
my blue letter?

1301
01:35:37,642 --> 01:35:41,042
Norman, just a dying man's last words
and wishes, no big deal.

1302
01:35:42,402 --> 01:35:43,922
I must've mislaid it.

1303
01:35:43,962 --> 01:35:46,803
It's in your apron pocket,
right where you left it.

1304
01:35:47,243 --> 01:35:48,203
Imbecile.

1305
01:35:48,323 --> 01:35:51,244
Failure to deliver a blue letter
is grounds for dismissal.

1306
01:35:52,765 --> 01:35:55,684
It's New Year's. I'm not going to add
to your woes.

1307
01:35:55,804 --> 01:35:58,125
Want to read it?
You might learn something.

1308
01:35:58,525 --> 01:36:01,005
Might keep you from jumping
out of any more windows.

1309

"Blue letter from the desk
of Waring Hudsucker...

"Of the years you and I have spent..."

1316

Standard resignation boilerplate.
Go down to the second paragraph.

"You will no doubt be wondering
why I've decided...

"Yes, I loved a woman once, Sid,

The New Year.

1369
01:40:37,250 --> 01:40:41,492
When he learned that Norville owned
the company, Sidney was upset at first.

1370
01:40:41,932 --> 01:40:44,612
It's a good thing Doc Bromfenbrenner
was there...

1371
01:40:45,612 --> 01:40:48,892
...because he was able to keep Sidney
from harming himself.

1372
01:40:49,292 --> 01:40:53,173
He prescribed a long rest in the sana....
In the sanatory....

1373
01:40:53,493 --> 01:40:54,814
In the booby hatch.

1374
01:40:55,934 --> 01:40:57,215
Now, Norville...

1375
01:40:57,855 --> 01:41:00,774
...he went on and ruled
with wisdom and compassion...

1376
01:41:01,454 --> 01:41:04,615
...and started dreaming up
them exciting new ideas again.

1377
01:41:05,215 --> 01:41:06,575
You know, for kids.

1378
01:41:06,775 --> 01:41:09,496
I had the boys down at R&D
throw together this prototype...

1379
01:41:09,576 --> 01:41:11,376
...so our discussion could have focus...

1380
01:41:11,456 --> 01:41:14,175
...and to give you gentlemen of the board
a firsthand look.

1381
01:41:19,377 --> 01:41:23,538
That's the story of how Norville Barnes
climbed way up...

1382
01:41:23,658 --> 01:41:26,378
...to the 44th floor
of the Hudsucker building...

1383
01:41:27,058 --> 01:41:30,899
...and then fell all the way down,
but didn't quite squish himself.

1384
01:41:31,899 --> 01:41:35,420
You know, they say there was a man
who jumped from the 45th floor.

1385
01:41:36,220 --> 01:41:37,900
But that's another story.
