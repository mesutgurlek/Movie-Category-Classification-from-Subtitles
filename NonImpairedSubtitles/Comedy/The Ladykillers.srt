<i>The world</i>

46
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:09,251
You know, they calls it hippity-hop music,

00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:54,391
The age of Montel!

76
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:40,139
The apostle John said, "Behold,

00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:20,751
<i>- To God</i>
<i>- Go back to God</i>

87
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,085
Do you need somethin' to eat, angel?

88
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:30,124
Othar, I went and complained
about Weemack today<i>,</i>

89
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:33,131
Don't know if it'll do any good<i>,</i>

90
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,033
That boy hangin' by a thread<i>,</i>
Over the pit<i>,</i>

91
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:42,871
Fiery pit!
"Left My Wallet in El Segundo<i>,</i>"

92
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,834
Ooh!

93
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:50,471
67 years of life<i>,</i>

94
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:53,948
46 years of marriage<i>,</i>

95
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:58,286
You mean to tell me you never once
suffered from piles?

96
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,350
Well, it's the human condition<i>,</i>

97
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:03,691
Most humans, anyhow<i>,</i>

98
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:08,723
Like that ballplayer said,
"The world's got two kind of folks<i>,</i>"

99
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:13,363
"Them that's got the piles
and them that's goin' get 'em<i>,</i>"

100
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:16,237
But you always was healthy as a ox<i>,</i>

101
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:20,075
Passed on 'fore you could get the piles<i>,</i>
Mm-hm<i>,</i>

102
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:23,513
Ooh, thank the Lord you never was sick<i>,</i>

103
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:29,818
I just want to pass away
nice and peaceful<i>,</i>

104
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:34,417
Go to sleep one night, wake up
in the glory land! Whoo!

105
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,382
Pickles!

106
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:03,788
- Go fetch Pickles!
- Pickles?

107
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:09,185
Oh, he's up that tree again!
You'd better shimmy on up<i>,</i>

108
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,958
Well, I do apologize, madam, but<i>,,,</i>

109
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:14,966
won't the feline eventually tire
of his lonely perch

110
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:17,935
and, pining for his master's affection,
return on his own initiative?

111
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:24,375
Uh, the point being,
must we actually ascend the tree?

112
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,106
Look, I don't want no doubletalk<i>,</i>

113
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,081
Now, if you not gon' fetch him,
I guess I gotta call the police<i>,</i>

114
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:32,811
- Police?
- And they not goin' be happy<i>,</i>

115
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:37,379
Every time they have to fetch him,
they swear they'll never do it no more<i>,</i>

116
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:41,018
No need to call the authorities, madam<i>,</i>

117
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:43,857
I did this often as a child<i>,</i>

118
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:47,388
I was a positive lemur<i>,</i>
Here, kitty!

119
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,868
- Oh, don't upset him now!
- I wouldn't think of it, madam<i>,</i>

120
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:55,840
Harmless little Felix domesticus<i>,</i>

121
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:59,105
Here, Kitty<i>,</i>
Come to G<i>,</i>H<i>,</i>

122
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:04,343
Come, come<i>,</i>
Here, kitty<i>,</i> Here, kitty<i>,</i>

123
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:06,078
Come, come, come<i>,</i>
No, no, no<i>,</i>

124
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,983
That's not how Sheriff Wyner do it<i>,</i>

125
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:09,851
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah<i>,</i>
Come, come, come<i>,</i>

126
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,815
Come to the professor<i>,</i>

127
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:17,623
Yes<i>,</i> Y<i>,,,</i>
Ah!

128
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:29,431
Uh<i>,,,</i> thank you, madam,
for your act of kindness<i>,</i>

129
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,103
- Well, you let him out<i>,</i>
- I certainly did,

130
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,840
and for that I apologize no end<i>,</i>

131
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:39,317
Allow me to present myself,
um, formally<i>,</i>

132
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:42,821
Goldthwait Higginson Dorr, Ph<i>,</i>D<i>,</i>

133
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:45,984
Like Elmer?

134
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:48,356
- I beg your pardon, ma'am?
- Fudd<i>,</i>

135
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:55,360
No, no, Ph<i>,</i>D<i>,</i> is a mark of
academic attainment

136
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:59,393
bestowed, in my case, in recognition of
my mastery of the antique languages

137
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:00,769
of Latin and Greek<i>,</i>

138
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,276
I also hold a number of other advanced
degrees, including the baccalaureate

139
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:07,210
from a school in Paris, France,
called the Sorbonne<i>,</i>

140
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,614
Sore bone<i>,</i>
Well, that fits<i>,</i>

141
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:14,517
You ever study at Bob Jones University?

142
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:16,077
I have not had that privilege<i>,</i>

143
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:19,852
Oh, that's a Bible school<i>,</i>
Only the finest in the country<i>,</i>

144
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:22,360
- I send 'em $5 every month<i>,</i>
- That is very generous<i>,,,</i>

145
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:25,420
- I'm on the mailin' list! I'm a Angel<i>,</i>
- Are you? Yes<i>,</i>

146
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:28,862
Oh, they list my name in
the newsletter every issue<i>,</i>

147
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:32,063
- Do they?
- Oh, I got the literature right over here,

148
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:34,902
- if you'd like to examine it<i>,,,</i>
- Perhaps when my head has

149
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:38,205
recovered from its, uh<i>,,,</i>
uh, buffeting<i>,</i>

150
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:41,269
Mrs<i>,</i> Munson, are you at all curious

151
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:46,148
as to why I darkened your door,
as the expression would have it,

152
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:49,779
on this lovely, lovely
camellia-scented morn?

153
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:52,688
Well, I was wonderin' till
you let Pickles out<i>,</i>

154
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,192
- I quite understand<i>,</i>
- Then in all the excitement<i>,,,</i>

155
00:09:55,261 --> 00:10:01,222
The fact is, I saw the sign in your window
advertising a room to let?

156
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,201
And there are no other such signs
among the houses

157
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:08,400
- on this charming, charming street<i>,</i>
- Yeah, I got a room<i>,</i>

158
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:12,467
$15 a week<i>,</i>
I'm lookin' for a quiet tenant<i>,</i>

159
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:17,244
Madam, you are addressing
a man who is quiet

160
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:23,915
and yet not quiet<i>,</i>
If I may offer a riddle<i>,</i>

161
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:29,254
I am currently on sabbatical from
the institution where I teach,

162
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:31,728
the University of Mississippi
at Hattiesburg<i>,</i>

163
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:35,358
I am takin' a year off to
indulge my passion,

164
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:37,299
and I do not believe that is
too strong a word,

165
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,168
- for the music of the Renaissance<i>,</i>
- Mm-hm<i>,</i>

166
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:44,300
I perform in, and have the honor of
directing, a period-instrument ensemble

167
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:47,437
that performs at Renaissance Fairs
and other cultural fora

168
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:49,708
throughout central and southern
Mississippi<i>,</i>

169
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:55,584
We perform on the instruments for which
the music was originally composed<i>,</i>

170
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,522
Now, wait a minute<i>,</i>
You got some kind of band?

171
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:05,254
Oh, no<i>,</i> The word "band" would be,
in this context, something of a misnomer<i>,</i>

172
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:09,097
Though we do play together,
hence the word "ensemble",

173
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,932
the nature of the music is such that,

174
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:16,338
well, one would hesitate to apply
the epithet "band"

175
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:20,004
- with connotations of janglin' rhythms<i>,</i>
- So y'all ain't playin' no hippity-hop?

176
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:24,778
"I Left My Wallet in El Segundo"<i>,</i>
Songs with the titles spelled all funny?

177
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:34,623
Oh, no, no<i>,</i> We play music that has been
composed to the greater glory of God<i>,</i>

178
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:40,258
Devotional music<i>,</i>
Church music<i>,</i>

179
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:41,731
Gospel music?

180
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:45,168
Well, inspired by the gospel, certainly<i>,</i>

181
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:48,695
The vintage, of course,
is no more recent than the Rococo<i>,</i>

182
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:52,471
Rococo, huh?
Well, I guess that'd be OK<i>,</i>

183
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:57,107
But I don't propose to inflict
our rehearsals on you<i>,</i>

184
00:11:57,183 --> 00:12:02,348
May I inquire,
do you have a root cellar?

185
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:08,188
Ah<i>,,,</i> Yes<i>,</i>

186
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:13,154
Yes, yes<i>,</i>

187
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:16,258
This looks promising<i>,</i>

188
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:17,495
A little dank, ain't it?

189
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:21,097
Indeed<i>,</i>
That only improves the acoustics<i>,</i>

190
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:30,915
Marvelous<i>,</i>

191
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:35,412
Yes<i>,</i> Ah!

192
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:39,424
Oh, these earthen walls
are ideal for baffling

193
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:45,021
the higher registers of the, uh<i>,,,</i>
lute or sackbut<i>,</i>

194
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:52,301
That is why so much music
of the cinquecento was played in crypts

195
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:55,932
and catacombs<i>,</i> This is ideal<i>,</i>
This is perfect<i>,</i> This is more than perfect<i>,</i>

196
00:12:56,008 --> 00:13:01,469
- I can scarcely contain my glee<i>,</i>
- Oh, you containin' it OK<i>,</i>

197
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:08,785
You gotta peel this shit out, man<i>,</i>
Sometimes it stick to the bottom<i>,</i>

198
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:12,255
Hey, this shit smells like piles<i>,</i>

199
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:14,383
You wouldn't even believe this, man<i>,</i>
Even out here on the casino floor

200
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,395
you gonna find goddamn
mercy pads, Tucks<i>,,,</i>

201
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,193
I don't know what the fuck people be
doin' here while they gamblin'<i>,</i>

202
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:24,396
Man, I ain't peelin' no funky shit
with my human hands<i>,</i>

203
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,961
That ain't nothin' but a prescription
for diseases and viruses

204
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:29,234
- and shit attackin' your fuckin' insides<i>,</i>
- Oh, well, shit, you gotta do it,

205
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,969
'cause Mr<i>,</i> Gudge checks everything<i>,</i>

206
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:34,410
This tunnel leads back onto the land
for all the people that work for Mannex<i>,</i>

207
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,745
Mannex Corporation<i>,</i> They own
the Bandit Queen, three other boats<i>,</i>

208
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,479
Now, this is where they think on their
corporate shit, Gudge and them<i>,</i>

209
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:45,214
I mean, the light's as ugly as all hell,
but, shit, ain't as many Tucks<i>,</i>

210
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,427
- Let me in, motherfucker!
- What's the password?

211
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,486
Kiss my ass!

212
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:00,437
Now, this is where they count
the dough<i>,</i> Now, if you try to take any of it,

213
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:05,102
Elron over there'll shoot yo' ass<i>,</i>
Goddamn!

214
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,372
Dawg, this is a motherfuckin' pigsty, man!

215
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:09,710
You are a squeakyass,
motherfuckin' pig!

216
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:13,081
Man, look at your ass<i>,</i>
You got Cocoa Krispies on your uniform<i>,</i>

217
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:15,382
Got breakfast there, and you still eatin'
goddamn lunch, man<i>,</i>

218
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:19,390
I swear to God, if that ass was nickels,
you'd be a motherfuckin' millionaire<i>,</i>

219
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:22,393
Spread out, boy<i>,</i> Look at you<i>,</i>
You a disgraceful fucka!

220
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:25,225
You is a fat motherfucker, man!
I swear<i>,,,</i>

221
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:27,390
Hey, Mr<i>,</i> Gudge, uh<i>,,,</i>

222
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:28,831
- How you doin' this mornin'?
- I'm doin' fine<i>,</i>

223
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:31,893
- All right<i>,</i>
- So, how's the new man?

224
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:34,030
Oh, shit, he a cleanin' motherfucker, man<i>,</i>

225
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:37,007
- Is that a fact?
- What's up, my nigga?

226
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:49,746
Cut! Cut, cut, cut!

227
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:53,815
Goddamn it, his canteen fell off<i>,</i>
Props!

228
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:57,693
- The goddamn thing's canteen fell off<i>,</i>
- OK<i>,</i> We're prepared for that<i>,</i>

229
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:01,130
Mountain, put Otto into the apparatus<i>,</i>

230
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,040
- What the hell is this?
- World War I vintage gas mask<i>,</i>

231
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:13,442
It's authentic<i>,</i> Strapped on,
of course, so it can't fall off<i>,</i>

232
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:16,242
Now, the animal is free to be
as active as he wants<i>,</i>

233
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:18,840
It doesn't inhibit his movement
in any way, and<i>,,,</i>

234
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,284
<i>,,,</i>I think it really sells the whole
doughboy thing<i>,</i>

235
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:23,878
- It looks like a fucking joke<i>,</i>
- Uh, you're absolutely right<i>,</i>

236
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:26,390
The gas mask is a whimsical concept<i>,</i>

237
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,551
How the hell does it eat when it gets to
the Nibbles Ready-to-Eat?

238
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:31,323
- Well, you're absolutely right<i>,</i>
- Don't let the clients see this<i>,</i>

239
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:33,262
- Or that Humane fucker<i>,</i>
- No, of course not<i>,</i>

240
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:34,993
They'll just shut the fuckin' spot down,
Pancake<i>,</i> They'll shut<i>,,,</i>

241
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:35,999
<i>,,,</i>shut the fuckin' spot down, OK?

242
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:38,298
Put the goddamn canteen back on
the dog<i>,</i> That says he's a soldier!

243
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:41,464
Dented tin canteen<i>,</i>
All right? Strap it to his fucking collar!

244
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:44,403
Easiest thing in the world<i>,</i>
I-I just thought<i>,,,</i>

245
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:45,738
What?

246
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:49,372
<i>,,,</i>but you're right<i>,</i> A canteen's much better<i>,</i>
Good concept<i>,</i> Let's go with that<i>,</i>

247
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,982
- What's he doing?
- Well, he's, uh<i>,,,</i>

248
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:59,286
- Just breathe normally, Otto<i>,</i>
- The fucking dog can't breathe<i>,</i>

249
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:02,122
Oh, no, he can breathe<i>,</i>
Eh, eh, that thing is<i>,,,</i>

250
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:05,129
- Just breathe normally, Otto<i>,</i>
- The fuckin' dog can't breathe<i>,</i>

251
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:06,664
The fuckin' dog cannot breathe!

252
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:08,723
OK? Get the fu<i>,,,</i>
Get that fuckin' thing off of him<i>,</i>

253
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,326
Of course<i>,</i>
Easiest thing in the world<i>,</i>

254
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:13,268
I don't have my Leatherman<i>,</i> Mountain,
give me your Leatherman<i>,</i> Chop, chop!

255
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:15,364
Chitra! Make sure that Humane fucker
doesn't come over here, OK?

256
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:17,102
Distract him<i>,</i>
He'll shit if he sees this<i>,</i>

257
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:20,942
There we go<i>,</i>
Mountain, have electric run me a stinger<i>,</i>

258
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:24,141
Don't give up on me, Otto!
Mountain, I need two live leads!

259
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:25,843
Uh, eh, but, Garth, the gennie's
a hundred yards away<i>,</i>

260
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:28,853
Goddamn it<i>,</i> Otto's gonna have irreversible
brain damage in about 30 seconds<i>,</i>

261
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:31,515
Here we go<i>,</i> OK, kiss of life<i>,</i>

262
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:34,388
Otto is fuckin' dead!
What the fuck are you doing?!

263
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,428
Otto is fuckin' dead!

264
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:42,859
Set! 320! 320! Hut!

265
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:52,105
Ugh!

266
00:16:57,483 --> 00:17:01,817
L-left<i>,</i> 90-tiger, x-slant<i>,</i>
On one<i>,</i> Ready? Break!

267
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:04,253
Hut!

268
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,958
Ugh! Ooh!

269
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:15,626
Split left<i>,</i> 68, Z-go<i>,</i>

270
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,966
- You the man<i>,</i> Hey, butthead!
- Huh?

271
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,370
- You the man!
- Me the man?

272
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,965
On one<i>,</i>
Ready? Break!

273
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:28,673
390! 390! Hut!

274
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:42,956
Ugh!

275
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:52,193
Oh, no!

276
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:56,674
Hudson! Get your ass off the field!
Get your ass off the field!

277
00:17:56,742 --> 00:18:00,303
Goddamn it! Hudson,
get your ass out of my game!

278
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,609
You couldn't catch a cold!

279
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:25,069
A'ight, Dragon Lady,
we want that fuckin' money<i>,</i>

280
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:26,900
We want that doughnut money<i>,</i>

281
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,309
- Oh! OK, papa-san<i>,,,</i>
- Whoa, whoa, whoa<i>,</i>

282
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:35,641
<i>,,,</i>we want that doughnut money<i>,</i>

283
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:37,545
We ain't fuckin' around, Mr<i>,</i> Hi-Ho<i>,</i>

284
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,413
Look, this fuckin' thing,
it ain't that complicated<i>,</i>

285
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:41,976
You give us all the fuckin' money,
you won't get shot in the head<i>,</i>

286
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:44,420
A'ight?
You got three seconds<i>,</i>

287
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:50,662
You<i>,,,</i> You got three fucking seconds,
a'ight? One, two, three<i>,</i> You understand?

288
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:53,630
- We want that doughnut money!
- I'm a count uno, and two and<i>,,,</i>

289
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:03,300
His fingers are way the fuck up my nose!

290
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:08,442
Get your fingers out my man's nose!

291
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:11,142
Cafe?

292
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:13,946
Ah!

293
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:18,121
Aah!

294
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:27,624
- Let it shine on
- All night

295
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:30,429
- Let it shine on
- Come on, now, let your

296
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:32,934
- Light from the lighthouse
- Let it

297
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,438
Shine on me

298
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,369
- Oh, let it
- Shine on

299
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:38,773
- Come on, let it
- Shine on

300
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,904
- I need you to let your
- Light from the lighthouse

301
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,845
Let it shine on me

302
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,510
- Let it shine on me
- Shine on

303
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,119
- Let it shine on me
- Shine on

304
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:50,778
- Let it shine on me
- Shine on

305
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,586
- You got to let it shine on me
- Shine on

306
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:55,786
- When you're walkin' in darkness
- Shine on

307
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,056
- You gotta let it shine
- Shine on

308
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:02,464
If you want to see the light
You gotta let it shine

309
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:04,397
You've got to let it shine

310
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:07,734
You've got to let it shine
Whoo!

311
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:12,106
Come on, shine, yes!
Come on, shine

312
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:13,940
Come on, shine

313
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:16,981
You've got to come on
and let it shine

314
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:23,215
Yeah, help me let it shine

315
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:26,382
Let it shine

316
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:29,052
Shine!

317
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:32,089
Oh, yeah

318
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:34,530
- Hey, let it shine
- Shine on

319
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,727
- Let it shine
- Shine on

320
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:39,293
- Let it shine
- Shine on

321
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:42,169
Let the light from the lighthouse

322
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,266
Shine<i>,,,</i>

323
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:46,004
On<i>,,,</i>

324
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,204
Me<i>,,,</i>!

325
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:50,771
Let it shine on me
Yeah!

326
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:13,032
I know you all remember that when
Moses came down the mountain

327
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:17,906
carrying the Word of God,
come down that Sinai peak,

328
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:20,672
- he caught them Israelites red-handed<i>,</i>
- Yes!

329
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:22,941
What'd he catch 'em doin'?

330
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:24,880
He caught 'em worshippin'

331
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,815
- a golden calf<i>,</i>
- Yes!

332
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:28,819
He caught 'em worshippin'

333
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:30,479
a false god<i>,</i>

334
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:34,920
He caught them Israelites in decline<i>,</i>

335
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:36,290
In decline!

336
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:39,159
What did Moses do when he saw those<i>,,,</i>

337
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:41,495
declinin', backslidin',
never-mindin' sinners?

338
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:43,261
What did he do?

339
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:47,431
Mosses smote those sinners
in his wrath! Yes, he did!

340
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:50,236
Y'all know what "smote" is?

341
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:53,275
I smite, you smite, he smites,
we done smote!

342
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:59,447
To smite is to go upside the head!

343
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:02,783
Because sometimes, brothers and sisters,
that's the only way!

344
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:04,822
The only way<i>,</i>

345
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:09,520
To smite is to remind
we got to stop that decline

346
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:13,462
and scramble back up to the face
of the Almighty God!

347
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:16,224
- Amen!
- Instead of worshippin'

348
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:20,931
that golden calf, that earthly trash
on that garbage island<i>,</i>

349
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:25,466
That garbage island in the shadowland,
wa-a-ay<i>,,,</i>

350
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:31,010
way outside the Kingdom of God!

351
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:34,348
That garbage island,
where scavenger birds feast

352
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:39,914
on the bones of the backslidin' damned!

353
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:43,859
And so<i>,,,</i>
let us pray<i>,</i>

354
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:59,072
My dear lady, I do so hope this is not
an inopportune time for our first practice<i>,</i>

355
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:00,304
Somebody die?

356
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:03,143
I beg your pardon? Oh!

357
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:06,707
No, no, no<i>,</i>
No, I'm not bereaved<i>,</i>

358
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:11,245
Though it is so kind of you to inquire<i>,</i>
The hearse is simply a vehicle

359
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:14,554
commodious enough to accommodate
all the members of our ensemble<i>,</i>

360
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:20,258
And, of course, our instruments contrived
in an age ignorant of miniaturization<i>,</i>

361
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:23,096
Allow me to introduce my friends,
my colleagues,

362
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:25,033
these devoted and passionate musicians<i>,</i>

363
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:27,264
Ain't no smokin' in this house<i>,</i>

364
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:29,705
Oh<i>,</i>
Sorry<i>,</i>

365
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:53,129
What do you think, General?
Present any problems?

366
00:23:57,436 --> 00:24:03,671
Good then<i>,</i> Gentlemen, why don't we
crowd around and go over the plan?

367
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:13,542
Gentlemen, this is the Bandit Queen<i>,</i>
Gambling den<i>,</i> Cash cow<i>,</i>

368
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:17,918
Sodom of the Mississippi Delta
and the focus of our little exercise<i>,</i>

369
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:19,854
Here is Orchard Street<i>,</i>

370
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:21,790
Here is the residence of Marva Munson,

371
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,454
the charming lady whom you all met
moments ago<i>,</i>

372
00:24:24,696 --> 00:24:26,323
Gentlemen, I'm sure you're all aware

373
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:29,856
that the Solons of the state of
Mississippi, to wit, its legislature,

374
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:32,403
have decreed that no gaming
establishment shall be erected

375
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,803
within its borders upon dry land<i>,</i>

376
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:38,001
They may, however, legally float<i>,</i>

377
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:42,274
While the gambling activity is restricted
to these riverboats, no such restrictions

378
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:45,339
apply to the functions ancillary
to this cash-besotted business<i>,</i>

379
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:47,977
The casino's offices, locker rooms,

380
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:51,216
facilities to cook and clean, and,
most importantly, its counting houses,

381
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:57,091
the reinforced, secret,
super-secure repositories of the lucre,

382
00:24:57,162 --> 00:25:01,292
may all be situated<i>,,,</i> wherever<i>,</i>

383
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:06,326
- Gawain, where is "wherever"?
- Say what?

384
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:10,139
- Where's the money?
- Oh<i>,</i>

385
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:12,938
OK, look<i>,</i>
At the end of every shift,

386
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:17,209
pit boss brings the cash down to
the hold of the ship in a locked cashbox,

387
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:21,309
and once a day all the cash is moved
down to the countin' room<i>,</i>

388
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:25,386
And where is the counting room?

389
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:30,224
Uh<i>,,,</i> it be right there in that square
where you pointin'<i>,</i>

390
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:33,992
And what,
to flog a horse that if not dead

391
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:39,503
is at this point in mortal danger of expiring,
does this little square represent?

392
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:42,996
Offices<i>,</i> Underground<i>,</i>

393
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:47,408
Ha!
Underground! Mmm!

394
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:50,277
Underground<i>,</i>

395
00:25:50,348 --> 00:25:52,475
During the casino's hours of operation,

396
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:55,242
the door to this counting room
is fiercely guarded<i>,</i>

397
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,845
The door itself is of redoubtable
Pittsburgh steel<i>,</i>

398
00:25:57,923 --> 00:26:01,415
When the casino closes this entire
underground complex is locked up,

399
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:05,858
and the armed guard
retreats to the casino's main entrance<i>,</i>

400
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:10,925
There, then, far from the guard,
reposes the money,

401
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:17,601
behind a five-inch-thick steel portal, yes<i>,</i>
But the walls<i>,,,</i>

402
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:21,544
the walls are but humble masonry

403
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:26,846
behind which is only the soft,
loamy soil deposited over centuries

404
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:30,376
by the Old Man,
the meanderin' Mississippi,

405
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:37,019
as it fanned its way back and forth across
the great alluvial plain, leaving earth<i>,</i>

406
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:42,030
This earth<i>,</i>

407
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:46,093
The General here, whose
curriculum vitae comprehends

408
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:49,902
massive tunnelin' experience through
the soil of his native French Indochina,

409
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:53,672
shall be directin'
our little old tunnelin' operation<i>,</i>

410
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:58,148
Garth Pancake, though a master of none,
is a jack of all those trades

411
00:26:58,216 --> 00:27:00,013
corollary to our aim<i>,</i>

412
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:02,349
He will be doin' such fabricatin'
and demolition work

413
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:06,049
- as our little caper shall require<i>,</i>
- Happy to be on board<i>,</i>

414
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:09,616
Gawain is our proverbial "inside man<i>,</i>"

415
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:14,427
He has managed to secure himself a berth
on the custodial staff of the Bandit Queen<i>,</i>

416
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:18,659
- Damn skippy!
- And this brings us to Lump<i>,</i>

417
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:23,440
To look at Lump, you might wonder
what specialized expertise

418
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:27,669
could he possibly offer
our merry little old band of miscreants<i>,</i>

419
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:31,113
Well, gentlemen,
in a project of such risks,

420
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:36,643
it is imperative to enlist the services of a
hooligan, a goon, an ape, a physical brute<i>,</i>

421
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:42,956
Someone who will be our security,
our battering ram, our blunt instrument<i>,</i>

422
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:46,259
And, on our behalf,
I wish him a warm Mississippi welcome<i>,</i>

423
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,162
- Fuckin' A<i>,</i>
- Whassup, my nigga?

424
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:51,396
Well, gentlemen, here you are<i>,</i>

425
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:54,302
Men of different backgrounds
and differing talents<i>,</i>

426
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:56,203
Men with, in fact,
but two things in common:

427
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:59,710
One, you all saw fit to answer my
advertisement in the Memphis Scimitar,

428
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:01,769
and two, you're all going to be,
in consequence,

429
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:04,838
very, very, incredibly<i>,,,</i> rich<i>,</i>

430
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:07,885
Let us revel in our adventure, gentlemen<i>,</i>

431
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:11,319
Let us make beautiful music together,

432
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:14,483
and, by all means,
let us keep this to ourselves<i>,</i>

433
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:19,792
What we say in this root cellar,
let it stay in this root cellar<i>,</i>

434
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:23,493
There's no "l" in "team"<i>,</i>

435
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,679
<i>Trouble in and trouble out</i>

436
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,883
<i>Trouble's what this world's about</i>

437
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:23,359
<i>Troubles of this world</i>
<i>the Devil's in this world</i>

438
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,419
<i>Trouble in, trouble out</i>

439
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:27,761
<i>Trouble's what this world's about</i>

440
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:31,029
<i>Troubles of this world</i>
<i>the Devil's in this world</i>

441
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:35,163
<i>You up the river without a paddle</i>
<i>in a lot of trouble</i>

442
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:39,176
<i>Without a doubt you going under</i>
<i>running out of bubbles</i>

443
00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:42,873
<i>Pass me the body bag</i>
<i>watch me dump 'em</i>

444
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:46,747
<i>It ain't nothing for you</i>
<i>to get squashed like a pumpkin</i>

445
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:50,447
<i>I try so hard and play my cards</i>
<i>afraid to fall, I ain't involved</i>

446
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:52,251
<i>I gotta call</i>
<i>I'm much appalled</i>

447
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:54,257
<i>I came to O Z</i>
<i>and broke the laws</i>

448
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:56,020
<i>Bring on the casket</i>
<i>ain't too glad</i>

449
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:58,358
<i>'Cause dirty hazard</i>
<i>wrapped in plastic</i>

450
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:46,108
It's OK<i>,</i> Don't stop on account of me<i>,</i>

451
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:48,407
No<i>,</i> No, no, no, no<i>,</i>
Not at all, madam<i>,</i>

452
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:50,709
Not at all<i>,</i> We were about to
take a break anyway<i>,</i>

453
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:55,014
The glissandi on this particular piece
are technically very, very demanding,

454
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:58,817
and I'm sure we would all welcome
a moment of R and R<i>,</i>

455
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:01,723
Well, I just thought
maybe you'd like to see<i>,,,</i>

456
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:05,160
What have you gotten into, honey?
Why you sweatin' like that?

457
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:08,530
Uh<i>,,,</i> Uh<i>,,,</i>

458
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:12,159
Uh, eh, 'cause, 'cause<i>,,,</i>
That boy right there?

459
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:15,400
He plays one bitch barrel
full of a sackbut!

460
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:16,997
- Ain't that right, Lump?
- Uh-huh<i>,</i>

461
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:19,134
I'm tellin' you, he can tear it up<i>,</i>
Right, Lump?

462
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:22,475
Ain't nobody play the sackbut
like Lump right there<i>,</i> He<i>,,,</i>

463
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:23,373
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

464
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:26,178
Don't be shy, Lump<i>,</i>
Don't be shy<i>,</i> Lump, that boy, he go<i>,,,</i>

465
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:28,742
at it like it was some pussy!

466
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,515
- Oh, shit!
- Mind your mouth!

467
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:35,355
This is a Christian house, boy<i>,</i>
No hippity-hop language in here<i>,</i>

468
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:39,021
- Sometime it's the only way<i>,</i>
- Now listen, you ain't gonna hit me<i>,,,</i>

469
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:43,557
I'm tryin' to help you, boy, better yourself!

470
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:46,069
And so you should, madam<i>,</i>
So you should<i>,</i>

471
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:49,732
Gawain is so far transported

472
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:53,174
by his love of the music of
the early Renaissance<i>,,,</i>

473
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:56,236
Don't make me no never-mind,
he transported!

474
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:57,804
- I understand<i>,</i>
- You been smokin'?

475
00:31:57,882 --> 00:32:01,113
Oh, certainly not, ma'am<i>,</i>
I understand your indignation, ma'am<i>,</i>

476
00:32:01,185 --> 00:32:03,449
And I was offering an explanation,
not an excuse<i>,</i>

477
00:32:03,688 --> 00:32:04,450
- I myself am<i>,,,</i>
- Hey, hey, hey<i>,,,</i>

478
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:06,456
<i>,,,</i>don't be explainin' me, dawg!

479
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:09,023
You can't read
my motherfuckin' mind, man!

480
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:12,824
You might got yo' Ph<i>,</i>D<i>,</i>,
but I got my GED!

481
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:15,331
- Yes<i>,</i>
- Nigga!

482
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:21,939
A fiery lad<i>,,,</i> but then youth is fiery<i>,</i>

483
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:26,568
A fact often remarked upon
by the poets of the Romantic era<i>,</i>

484
00:32:26,644 --> 00:32:29,477
My youth, I was in church<i>,</i>
I wasn't walkin' around fiery<i>,</i>

485
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:32,573
Youth ain't no excuse for nothin'<i>,</i>

486
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:40,314
Anyhow, I just came to show you the fife<i>,</i>
Othar's fife<i>,</i> Burned his own<i>,</i>

487
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:44,088
I thought maybe, you bein'
a man of music, you'd be interested<i>,</i>

488
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:46,926
Oh, indeed I am<i>,</i>

489
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:49,626
Cut it hisself and burned his holes<i>,</i>

490
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,800
The Israelites called it a khalil<i>,</i>

491
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:57,603
Yeah, you can read all about it in
the Bible<i>,</i> Ain't nothin' new under the sun<i>,</i>

492
00:32:57,675 --> 00:32:59,370
Indeed not<i>,</i>

493
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:07,783
Gone these 20 years<i>,</i>

494
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:10,582
He was some kind of man<i>,</i>

495
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:18,494
Blowed the khalil<i>,</i>

496
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:28,400
I don't suppose Othar ever turned his hand

497
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:34,639
or, or turned his lip
to blowing the shofar?

498
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:43,478
The ceremonial ram's horn
sounded by the priests of the Hebrews<i>,</i>

499
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:49,049
No, I don't know nothin' about that<i>,</i>
Othar never blowed no shofar!

500
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:52,062
- Of course not<i>,</i>
- Not to the extent of my knowledge<i>,</i>

501
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:55,793
The khalil was good enough
for my Othar<i>,</i>

502
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:59,835
He was some kind of man<i>,</i>

503
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,198
Some kind of man<i>,</i>

504
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:10,546
Oh, goddamn! Come on, girl,
let me get one little peek<i>,</i>

505
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:12,446
Don't be cruel<i>,</i>
Come on, just one butt cheek<i>,</i>

506
00:34:12,683 --> 00:34:14,674
Pull that ass out and make it clap<i>,</i>

507
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:19,084
Aw, just 'cause I'm dressed like a janitor,
don't mean you gotta do me dirty<i>,</i>

508
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:22,126
This muthafucka's hit the jackpot<i>,</i>
Come on, girl<i>,</i>

509
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:23,785
Come over here and blow on these dice<i>,</i>

510
00:34:23,861 --> 00:34:26,125
You know, I'm a seven on the roll now,
but I'm a 10 the hard way,

511
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:27,664
and I ain't just talkin' crap<i>,</i>

512
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:34,770
Mr<i>,</i> Gudge, she had a ass
that could pull a bus<i>,</i>

513
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:38,275
I mean, Gudge, it was more than an ass,
it was literature<i>,</i>

514
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:42,369
Yeah, I don't care how big her ass was,
MacSam<i>,</i> You're fired<i>,</i>

515
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:43,436
You say what?

516
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:46,745
There is no fraternizing with customers
on the Bandit Queen<i>,</i>

517
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:48,877
- Clean out your locker<i>,</i>
- But, Mr<i>,</i> Gudge, I wasn't fraterniz<i>,,,</i>

518
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:50,420
I said get outta here<i>,</i>
You're fired<i>,</i>

519
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:54,083
You can't fire me!
I'll sue your ass!

520
00:34:54,158 --> 00:34:56,058
Sue me?
For what?

521
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:58,288
For fuckin' punitive damages, man!

522
00:34:58,362 --> 00:34:59,488
- Punitive damages<i>,</i>
- Yeah<i>,</i>

523
00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:01,688
Punitive damages<i>,</i>
You goddamn skippy!

524
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:05,258
- Punitive damages<i>,</i>
- I see why you firin' me, Mr<i>,</i> Gudge<i>,</i>

525
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:09,136
Yeah, it's simple and plain<i>,</i>
You firin' me 'cause I'm black<i>,</i>

526
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:15,678
MacSam, everybody
on the custodial staff is black<i>,</i>

527
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:17,737
Your replacement is gonna be black<i>,</i>

528
00:35:17,815 --> 00:35:20,215
His replacement, no doubt, will be black!

529
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:24,183
Well, the fuckin' judge is goin' be black,
muthafucka<i>,</i>

530
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:25,244
- Oh<i>,</i>
- And you?

531
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:27,655
- You gon' stand tall before the man<i>,</i>
- Oh<i>,</i>

532
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:29,215
And your replacement's gonna be black,

533
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:31,454
- muthafucka!
- Thank you<i>,</i>

534
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,659
Oh, my<i>,</i>

535
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:37,462
Oh, my, my, my,
my, my, my, my<i>,</i>

536
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:38,999
This is a severe setback<i>,</i>

537
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,664
I am distraught<i>,</i>
I'm more than distraught<i>,</i>

538
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:43,673
I am devastated<i>,</i>

539
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:47,404
I-I'm beside myself<i>,</i>
I'm at a positive loss for words<i>,</i>

540
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:51,175
- You still talkin' OK, though<i>,</i>
- Have you all decided?

541
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:56,482
Madam, we must have waffles<i>,</i>
We must all have waffles forthwith<i>,</i>

542
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:58,784
We must all think<i>,</i>
We must all have waffles

543
00:35:58,856 --> 00:36:02,223
and think, each and every one of us,
to the very best of his ability<i>,</i>

544
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:05,820
Perhaps if you apologized to the man
and gave him flowers<i>,</i>

545
00:36:05,897 --> 00:36:08,092
Or perhaps a fruit basket

546
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:11,966
with a card depicting a misty seascape
and inscribed with a sentiment<i>,</i>

547
00:36:12,036 --> 00:36:15,369
I ain't apologizin' to that muthafucka<i>,</i>
He fired me 'cause I'm black!

548
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:18,670
He can't do that<i>,</i> You could sue him<i>,</i>
Open and shut case<i>,</i>

549
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:20,711
- Fuckin' A<i>,</i>
- Surely a chocolate assortment

550
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:24,509
has been known to melt the heart
of even the hardest misanthrope<i>,</i>

551
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:26,880
That man ain't rollin' over
for no fucking candy bar<i>,</i>

552
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:29,715
Uh, we've had a bit of a setback
on the tunneling front, too<i>,</i>

553
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:33,917
- We've run into a pretty large rock<i>,</i>
- Rock!

554
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:40,460
- Very bad<i>,</i> Very bad<i>,</i>
- Oh, my<i>,</i>

555
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:45,934
Seems that the poet was right<i>,</i>

556
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:48,995
Troubles never singly come<i>,</i>

557
00:36:49,073 --> 00:36:51,007
Oh, no, we can get through the rock<i>,</i>
No worries there<i>,</i>

558
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:53,475
Easiest thing in the world<i>,</i>
Why, we just blow right through it<i>,</i>

559
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:56,976
I got a pyro license<i>,</i>
Just, uh, bore a hole in the rock

560
00:36:57,048 --> 00:37:01,007
and pack in a little plastique<i>,</i>
Igneous blows pretty good<i>,</i>

561
00:37:01,085 --> 00:37:02,382
- And then we could<i>,,,</i>
- Hello, Garth<i>,</i>

562
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:04,887
- Am I ordering the primer cord?
- Yes, Mountain<i>,</i>

563
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:08,722
We were just talking about that,
and some plastique<i>,</i>

564
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:11,660
- What the fuck is this?
- Oh, this is Mountain Girl<i>,</i>

565
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:14,857
Mountain is my right hand<i>,</i>
She helps me out with ordnance<i>,</i>

566
00:37:14,932 --> 00:37:17,901
- Helps me with<i>,,,</i> damn near everything<i>,</i>
- Hey<i>,</i>

567
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:21,897
You brought yo' bitch to the Waffle Hut?

568
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:26,535
I must confess myself
to be puzzled as well<i>,</i>

569
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:30,411
I thought it was understood that
when it came to our little enterprise,

570
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:32,813
"mum" was the word<i>,</i>

571
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:35,249
Of course, I understand that,
but this is Mountain Girl<i>,</i>

572
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:37,514
I don't keep secrets from Mountain<i>,</i>

573
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:40,455
That's not how you maintain a loving,
caring relationship<i>,</i>

574
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:44,286
You brought yo' bitch to the Waffle Hut!

575
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:49,265
The man brought his bitch<i>,,,</i>
to the Waffle Hut!

576
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:52,791
All right, look, you, I will thank you
to stop referring to Mountain that way<i>,</i>

577
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:54,531
She is the other half of my life<i>,</i>

578
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:59,668
Everybody lookin' at me like I'm some kind
of fuck-up for losin' a sorry-ass job,

579
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:03,407
and this muthafucka brings his bitch

580
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:06,173
- to the muthafuckin' Waffle Hut!
- Son-of-a-bitch punk!

581
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,810
- Shut your goddamn mouth!
- You better raise the fuck up, fucka!

582
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:10,353
- Gentlemen, please<i>,</i>
- Back the fuck up!

583
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:11,888
You gon' back that shit the fuck up!

584
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,686
- Gentlemen, please<i>,</i>
- What?! What?!

585
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:19,059
Please, gentlemen, this behavior does you
no credit in the eyes of your colleagues,

586
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:23,226
nor in those of the other patrons
of this Waffle Hut<i>,</i>

587
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,235
Little punk<i>,</i>

588
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,999
Oh, look at this<i>,</i>
I got blueberry syrup on my safari jacket!

589
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:32,634
Gentlemen, I propose that we consider
the matter of this woman,

590
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:35,304
- Mountain Water<i>,,,</i>
- Mountain Girl<i>,</i>

591
00:38:35,379 --> 00:38:40,146
I'm so very sorry<i>,</i> I propose
that we consider this matter closed<i>,</i>

592
00:38:40,217 --> 00:38:44,950
And we shall choose to trust her
since we have no choice,

593
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:48,549
and since she shall share only
in Mr<i>,</i> Pancake 's portion of the booty<i>,</i>

594
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:51,151
Of course<i>,</i>
Wouldn't have it any other way<i>,</i>

595
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:53,458
- Yeah, you damn right you won't<i>,</i>
- Up yours, punk<i>,</i>

596
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:56,394
- Oh, fuck you and the Swiss Miss<i>,</i>
- The matter of disposing

597
00:38:56,467 --> 00:38:59,595
- of our igneous impediment is also<i>,,,</i>
- C-Coach<i>,,,</i> Coach<i>,,,</i>

598
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:02,935
- C-C-Coach, I<i>,,,</i>
<i>- ,,,</i>closed<i>,</i> Settled<i>,</i>

599
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:08,035
That leaves us only with the question
of Gawain retrieving his job<i>,</i>

600
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:10,342
- Coach, I<i>,,,</i>
- Yes, Lump?

601
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:12,382
Couldn't we just bribe the guy?

602
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:34,166
You are a readin' fool,
aren't you, Mr<i>,</i> Dorr?

603
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,738
Yes, I must confess<i>,</i>

604
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:41,369
I often find myself more at home
in these ancient volumes

605
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:46,280
than I do in the hustle-bustle
of the modern world<i>,</i>

606
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:52,084
To me, paradoxically, the literature
of the so-called "dead tongues"

607
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:56,388
holds more currency
than this morning's newspaper<i>,</i>

608
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:00,624
In these books, in these volumes,

609
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:05,294
there is the accumulated wisdom
of mankind, which succors me

610
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:10,466
when the day is hard
and the night lonely and long<i>,</i>

611
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:16,276
Mm<i>,</i> The wisdom of mankind, huh?

612
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:19,282
- What about the wisdom of the Lord?
- Oh<i>,,,</i>

613
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:25,914
Yes, yes<i>,</i> The Good Book, mm<i>,</i>
I have found reward in its pages<i>,</i>

614
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:32,020
But, to me, there are other
good books as well<i>,</i>

615
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:41,495
Heavy volumes of antiquity freighted
with the insights of man's glorious age<i>,</i>

616
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:50,409
And then, of course, I just love, love, love
the works of Mr<i>,</i> Edgar Allan Poe<i>,</i>

617
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:53,450
Oh, I know who he was<i>,</i>
Kinda spooky<i>,</i>

618
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:56,111
No, madam, no, no<i>,</i>

619
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:59,520
Not of this world, it's true<i>,</i>

620
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:05,457
He<i>,,,</i> he lived in a dream<i>,</i>
An ancient dream<i>,</i>

621
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:11,599
"Helen,

622
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:16,402
Thy beauty is to me

623
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:21,411
Like those Nicean barks of yore,

624
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:26,678
That gently, o'er a perfumed sea,

625
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:30,413
The weary, wayworn wanderer bore

626
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:34,686
To his own native shore<i>,</i>"

627
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,796
Who was Helen?

628
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:48,237
- Some kinda whore of Babylon?
- One doesn't know who Helen was<i>,,,</i>

629
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:53,504
but I picture her as being very, very<i>,,,</i>

630
00:41:53,711 --> 00:41:57,613
extremely<i>,,,</i>

631
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,308
pale<i>,</i>

632
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:09,381
Mrs<i>,</i> Munson, I have been trying

633
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:14,261
to figure out some way of
expressin' my gratitude to you

634
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:20,463
for takin' in this weary, wayworn wanderer<i>,</i>

635
00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:25,364
It's just a little old present<i>,</i>
Why, it's hardly anything at all<i>,</i>

636
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:30,004
Oh, why, Mr<i>,</i> Dorr!
You are a gallant man<i>,</i>

637
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,048
Oh, madam, I blush, I melt<i>,</i>
No<i>,,,</i>

638
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:34,414
I just happened to hear
of this gospel concert tomorrow night,

639
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:36,578
"The Mighty, Mighty Clouds of Joy",

640
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:39,589
and I thought you and a friend
from church perhaps would<i>,,,</i>?

641
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:43,184
- Yes, I have a widow lady friend<i>,</i>
- The concert is up in Memphis,

642
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:46,889
so I have arranged a car service
to transport you thither<i>,</i>

643
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:50,029
Ah?

644
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:53,297
Why, Sheriff Wyner!
How you doin'?

645
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:54,428
Good evenin', Mrs<i>,</i> Munson<i>,</i>

646
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:58,100
I just stopped by here to let you know
I did have a talk with Weemack,

647
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:00,905
and he told me he's gonna comply
with your request

648
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:02,309
in keepin' that music down
and neighborly<i>,</i>

649
00:43:02,379 --> 00:43:04,370
So you just go and have yourself
a pleasant evenin'<i>,</i>

650
00:43:04,448 --> 00:43:06,439
Wait a minute<i>,</i>
I got somebody that I want you to meet<i>,</i>

651
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:09,585
Uh, ma'am, you know what? I'm<i>,,,</i>
I'm a little pressed for time<i>,</i>

652
00:43:09,653 --> 00:43:11,644
You got a gang of bank robbers
youse chasin'?

653
00:43:11,722 --> 00:43:13,781
Come on in here and say hello<i>,</i>

654
00:43:13,857 --> 00:43:16,451
Yeah, we was in here, havin' tea and<i>,,,</i>

655
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:23,929
Huh!

656
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:27,528
Bussed his own dishes<i>,</i>
You can always tell a gentleman<i>,</i>

657
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:31,006
- Somebody was in here, ma'am?
- Yeah, with me and Othar<i>,</i>

658
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:33,373
Well, you know what?
Maybe I'll catch him the next time<i>,</i>

659
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,969
Oh, come on up to his room
with me and say hello<i>,</i>

660
00:43:36,046 --> 00:43:37,911
I got a family<i>,</i>
My wife got dinner on the table<i>,</i>

661
00:43:37,982 --> 00:43:39,916
I really have to be goin'<i>,</i>

662
00:43:43,053 --> 00:43:48,491
- Oh, my<i>,</i> He is neat!
- Yes, ma'am, he very neat<i>,</i>

663
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:54,062
He probably went down to the cellar
to play with his friends<i>,</i>

664
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:56,691
Ma'am, I really got to be goin' now<i>,</i>

665
00:43:56,767 --> 00:44:00,100
- What<i>,,,</i>?
- Ma'am, I really need to be gettin' back<i>,</i>

666
00:44:02,072 --> 00:44:05,007
Mrs<i>,</i> Munson, don't<i>,,,</i>
You don't have to<i>,,,</i>

667
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:06,042
Mrs<i>,</i> Munson?

668
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:09,637
Why, Professor!

669
00:44:09,713 --> 00:44:14,275
What in the world are you doin'
havin' tea down there?

670
00:44:14,351 --> 00:44:15,750
Uh<i>,,,</i> Mrs<i>,</i> Munson?

671
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,480
Oh, Lord Jesus<i>,</i>

672
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:28,928
- Mrs<i>,</i> Munson?
- Land of Goshen, child!

673
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:33,129
- Come on out from under there!
- Mrs<i>,</i> Munson, my pager just went off<i>,</i>

674
00:44:33,203 --> 00:44:38,072
I got to go<i>,</i> Mm-hm<i>,</i>
I'll meet you and your friend later<i>,</i>

675
00:44:41,745 --> 00:44:44,270
That was refreshing<i>,</i>

676
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:45,406
Y'all have a good evenin' now!

677
00:44:45,482 --> 00:44:48,781
As you know, we academics are
inordinately fond of wedgin' ourselves

678
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:50,945
- into confined spaces<i>,</i>
- Mm!

679
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:55,424
At Yale, the students will see how many
of their number they can enclose

680
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:57,824
in a telephone booth<i>,</i>
At Harvard, a broom closet<i>,</i>

681
00:44:57,895 --> 00:45:00,363
Oh! Hope I didn't spill my tea<i>,</i>

682
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:04,698
Well, what the hell is this?

683
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:08,436
I guess it's just my way of sayin', um<i>,,,</i>

684
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:14,673
Oh, well, goddamn it, Mr<i>,</i> Gudge<i>,</i>
Look here, I<i>,,,</i>

685
00:45:14,745 --> 00:45:16,713
I don't know what it's like
walkin' in your shoes<i>,</i>

686
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:18,839
You know, with you bein'
a tight-ass and all<i>,</i>

687
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:23,114
And I'm pretty sure you don't know
what it's like walkin' in my shoes<i>,</i>

688
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:26,213
See, Mr<i>,</i> Gudge,
there's the custodian, right?

689
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:29,384
And then there's the man
inside the custodian<i>,</i>

690
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:32,258
And that's the motherfucker
we got a problem with<i>,</i>

691
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:34,729
See, 'cause that man,
he got needs, Mr<i>,</i> Gudge,

692
00:45:34,798 --> 00:45:38,199
and normally those needs
gotta do with women with big asses<i>,</i>

693
00:45:38,268 --> 00:45:42,432
I guess my point bein' is
I realize I'm a bunkie junkie<i>,</i>

694
00:45:42,506 --> 00:45:46,909
But if you woulda seen the kettle drums
on this girl, Mr<i>,</i> Gudge, whew!

695
00:45:46,977 --> 00:45:50,879
Well<i>,,,</i> we all human<i>,</i>

696
00:45:50,948 --> 00:45:55,544
This apology buys you
a one-week probationary period<i>,</i>

697
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:57,686
Thank you, Mr<i>,</i> Gudge<i>,</i>

698
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,985
Stay away from the customers,
MacSam<i>,</i>

699
00:46:10,901 --> 00:46:13,734
This drill bit's getting awfully hot<i>,</i>

700
00:46:13,804 --> 00:46:19,902
Gawain, maybe you could fill a Hudson
sprayer and spritz it down while I drill<i>,</i>

701
00:46:19,977 --> 00:46:24,937
Fuck you<i>,</i> I ain't your motherfuckin'
house nigger<i>,</i> I'm the inside man<i>,</i>

702
00:46:25,015 --> 00:46:26,949
All right, look, are you gonna have
a bug up your ass

703
00:46:27,017 --> 00:46:28,484
for the rest of the time we
work together?

704
00:46:28,552 --> 00:46:31,453
- I'll get the sprayer<i>,</i>
- Oh, no, no<i>,</i> No<i>,</i>

705
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:34,389
Me and this gentleman here
have to get square<i>,</i>

706
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:37,222
Let me tell you somethin', MacSam<i>,</i>

707
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:39,660
I'm gonna tell you about
how I came down to Mississippi<i>,</i>

708
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:45,396
I wasn't born here, you know<i>,</i>
I'm from Scranton, Pennsylvania<i>,</i>

709
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:46,458
What the fuck?

710
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:53,469
Scranton<i>,</i> Pennsylvania<i>,</i>
Came down here in 1964<i>,</i> Greyhound bus<i>,</i>

711
00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:55,307
With the Freedom Riders<i>,</i>

712
00:46:56,914 --> 00:46:59,178
Do you know who
the Freedom Riders were, MacSam?

713
00:46:59,249 --> 00:47:00,841
No, and I don't give a fuck<i>,</i>

714
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:03,182
Just tell me when the fuck
they gonna leave<i>,</i> Damn!

715
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:05,187
The Freedom Riders,
my fine young man,

716
00:47:05,255 --> 00:47:07,780
were a group of concerned liberals
from up north,

717
00:47:07,858 --> 00:47:11,316
all working together,
just like we are here<i>,</i>

718
00:47:11,395 --> 00:47:13,795
Involved citizens who came down here

719
00:47:13,864 --> 00:47:17,425
so that local black folk
could have their civil liberties<i>,</i>

720
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:20,470
So that people like you
could have the vote<i>,</i>

721
00:47:26,109 --> 00:47:29,567
- You know what, man?
- What, brother?

722
00:47:29,646 --> 00:47:33,275
- I don't vote<i>,</i> So fuck you<i>,</i>
- You little fuckin' ingrate<i>,</i>

723
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:35,841
- And the bus you rode in on, jackass!
- Let's step outside, MacSam!

724
00:47:35,919 --> 00:47:37,511
Fuck the outside!
Come on! What?!

725
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:39,453
<i>(knocking)</i>

726
00:47:42,292 --> 00:47:45,819
My friend Mrs<i>,</i> Funthes is here,
so I'm about to go out<i>,</i>

727
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:49,024
Just thought I'd leave y'all
with some cinnamon cookies<i>,</i>

728
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:51,932
Why, that is lovely<i>,</i>

729
00:47:52,002 --> 00:47:54,562
Ooh, y'all sound good!

730
00:47:54,638 --> 00:47:58,369
<i>(chuckles)</i> Maybe you could come by
the church one Sunday<i>,,,</i>

731
00:47:58,442 --> 00:48:01,343
- give us a recital<i>,</i>
- Why, how kind of you!

732
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:05,279
Our music, however, is, uh<i>,,,</i>
well, how shall I put this?

733
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:08,011
Uh, a bit Roman in its outlook<i>,</i>

734
00:48:08,085 --> 00:48:11,350
Uh, many of our pieces were
commissioned by the Holy See<i>,</i>

735
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:13,685
Oh, I see, all right,

736
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:17,352
but we don't make no big
whoop-dee-do about denomination<i>,</i>

737
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:22,293
Everybody welcome at our church<i>,</i>
Yeah, we had a Methodist come in<i>,</i>

738
00:48:22,366 --> 00:48:28,236
Episcopalian<i>,</i> Back in the '60s,
we had a Jew come in!

739
00:48:28,305 --> 00:48:31,741
- He had a guitar<i>,</i>
<i>- (chucking)</i> A Jew with a guitar<i>,</i>

740
00:48:31,808 --> 00:48:36,108
If you will excuse me one moment, madam,
I shall, uh, I shall see you out<i>,</i>

741
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:39,808
If you gentlemen can labor harmoniously
in the course of my absence,

742
00:48:39,883 --> 00:48:41,908
perhaps upon my return
we shall be prepared to explode

743
00:48:41,985 --> 00:48:44,215
that vexin' old piece of igneous<i>,</i>

744
00:48:45,822 --> 00:48:49,952
Oh, Professor!
This is Mrs<i>,</i> Funthes<i>,</i>

745
00:48:50,027 --> 00:48:52,723
<i>Enchante,</i> Mrs<i>,</i> Funthes<i>,</i> Allow me<i>,</i>

746
00:48:52,796 --> 00:48:56,755
Rosalie, this is Professor
G<i>,</i>H<i>,</i> Dorr, Ph<i>,</i>D<i>,</i>

747
00:48:57,668 --> 00:49:00,398
Oh, my<i>,</i> That's an awful lot of letters<i>,</i>

748
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:01,960
Oh, well, no<i>,</i>

749
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:06,942
Of course, in my youth,
I was known simply as Goldthwait<i>,</i>

750
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:07,874
Uh-huh<i>,</i>

751
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,776
All right, safety meeting<i>,</i>

752
00:49:09,846 --> 00:49:12,872
Let's listen up<i>,</i> General,
can you hand me the primer cord?

753
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:16,249
Before we set the charge,
we will run through our procedure<i>,</i>

754
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:20,416
I have earplugs for whoever wants them<i>,</i>
Just wedge those right in your ears<i>,</i>

755
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:23,058
Now, here we have<i>,,,</i>
Not yet, Lump<i>,</i>

756
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:25,424
- Oh<i>,</i>
- Now, primer cord<i>,</i>

757
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:28,927
Gelatinite<i>,</i> C-4<i>,</i>

758
00:49:28,999 --> 00:49:32,696
Time comes, we pack the hole
in the rock with the C-4

759
00:49:32,769 --> 00:49:36,830
and insert two leads: A and B<i>,</i>

760
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:39,636
I remember my father sayin' to me -

761
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:41,940
and it's one of the few memories
I retain of the man

762
00:49:42,012 --> 00:49:45,709
from one of his visits home,
and how I do cherish it -

763
00:49:45,782 --> 00:49:53,211
he said to me, "Goldthwait,
you are not formed as other boys<i>,</i>"

764
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:54,655
He a man of learnin'?

765
00:49:54,725 --> 00:49:58,217
This is the same procedure we will
be using when we collapse the tunnel

766
00:49:58,295 --> 00:50:02,254
after entering the casino vault
and returning to the root cellar<i>,</i>

767
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:06,234
He was a self-educated man<i>,</i>
Didn't have a career as such,

768
00:50:06,303 --> 00:50:09,397
but the government did recognize
the breadth of his readin'

769
00:50:09,473 --> 00:50:14,035
by makin' him librarian
of the state nervous hospital in Meridian,

770
00:50:14,111 --> 00:50:17,979
where he was a distinguished inmate<i>,</i>

771
00:50:18,048 --> 00:50:23,680
Once these materials are combined
only the professionals may handle them<i>,</i>

772
00:50:23,754 --> 00:50:27,417
That means me or the General<i>,</i>

773
00:50:27,491 --> 00:50:30,358
Separately they are harmless,
completely inert<i>,</i>

774
00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:34,022
Why, you could light this stuff on fire,
hit it with a ham<i>,,,</i>

775
00:50:34,097 --> 00:50:36,258
<i>(explosion)</i>

776
00:50:39,302 --> 00:50:44,069
What in the name of
heavens was that?

777
00:50:44,141 --> 00:50:48,441
Well, um<i>,,,</i> I'm quite certain there's
absolutely no reason to be alarmed<i>,</i>

778
00:50:48,512 --> 00:50:52,505
Why, I'm not even absolutely certain
I heard anything at all<i>,</i>

779
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:54,343
Didn't hear nothin'?!

780
00:50:54,418 --> 00:50:56,943
Well, something perhaps<i>,</i>

781
00:50:57,020 --> 00:51:01,047
Nothing that need discompose us
was the sense I was tryin' to convey<i>,</i>

782
00:51:01,124 --> 00:51:05,083
Now, Mrs<i>,</i> Munson, I will not have you
missin' your musical recital<i>,</i> Off you go!

783
00:51:05,162 --> 00:51:08,393
I shall call the gas company,
or the water company<i>,</i>

784
00:51:08,465 --> 00:51:13,402
Whatever subterranean utility
is implicated in this contretemps<i>,</i>

785
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:19,067
I shall see to the matter,
as only a highly educated classicist could<i>,</i>

786
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:32,021
Blood! Blood, Professor, blood!
Blood, blood, blood!

787
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:34,751
<i>(Pancake)</i> It's nothin' to make a fuss about<i>,</i>
It's perfectly all right<i>,</i>

788
00:51:34,825 --> 00:51:37,487
Jackass! You better get yo' ass back
down there and find that shit, dipshit!

789
00:51:37,561 --> 00:51:40,155
- Really, I'm perfectly all right<i>,</i>
- Perfectly all right?

790
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:42,960
Jackass, you just blew
your goddamn finger off!

791
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:45,593
The muthafucka down there
flappin' the fuck around!

792
00:51:45,669 --> 00:51:47,500
You better get yo' ass
back down there and find it!

793
00:51:47,737 --> 00:51:50,228
I'm tellin' you right now, nubbie,
I ain't pickin' up your goddamn finger!

794
00:51:50,307 --> 00:51:52,275
I gather there was a premature detonation<i>,</i>

795
00:51:52,342 --> 00:51:54,708
Would you tell this muthafucka
he can sew this shit back on?!

796
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:57,303
It's like that dude whose wife cut
his dick off, threw it on the freeway?

797
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:58,938
She just called Triple A,

798
00:51:59,015 --> 00:52:01,279
they towed the dick
and sewed the muthafucka back on!

799
00:52:01,351 --> 00:52:04,081
Listen up! Jackass,
I saw the muthafucka in a porno!

800
00:52:04,154 --> 00:52:06,452
The thang still worked!
It looked like a chewed-up frank,

801
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:07,952
but that little muthafucka
be workin' that muthafucka!

802
00:52:08,024 --> 00:52:12,256
It's mangly, but he be fuckin' the bitch
all kind of ways with a twisted dick!

803
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:15,389
Oh! Your fuckin' finger just moved!
The muthafucka movin' slow now!

804
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:19,265
I'm not gettin' that shit<i>,</i>
Fuck that! You're on your own there!

805
00:52:19,336 --> 00:52:23,830
They usin' the house
to practice music<i>,,,</i> of the Rococo<i>,</i>

806
00:52:23,907 --> 00:52:26,137
Mmm-hm<i>,</i>

807
00:52:27,077 --> 00:52:30,137
I propose we get our fallen comrade
to the hospital<i>,</i>

808
00:52:30,213 --> 00:52:34,013
The General will follow when
he manages to recover the severed digit<i>,</i>

809
00:52:34,084 --> 00:52:38,418
No, no, really, I'm perfectly all right<i>,</i>
I don't know what all the fuss is about<i>,</i>

810
00:52:39,222 --> 00:52:43,420
- Good news! Good news!
- Pickles! Go get him!

811
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:45,688
The house is in apple-pie order,

812
00:52:45,762 --> 00:52:48,890
though we do have to get
medical attention for Mr<i>,</i> Pancake,

813
00:52:48,965 --> 00:52:52,901
who, durin' the disturbance, pinched
his finger in the valve of his sackbut<i>,</i>

814
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:54,436
You let the cat out!

815
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:59,498
Wha<i>,,,</i>? The General is even now
exercisin' every effort in retrievin'

816
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:01,942
your mischievous little Pickles<i>,</i>
Please, go on<i>,</i>

817
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:06,415
Go on and enjoy the concert!
Driver! <i>Au revoir,</i> mesdames<i>,</i>

818
00:53:18,762 --> 00:53:22,323
<i>(Dorr)</i> Despite our setback,
we find ourselves on schedule

819
00:53:22,399 --> 00:53:27,336
to penetrate the vault here this afternoon,
while Mrs<i>,</i> Munson is at church,

820
00:53:27,404 --> 00:53:31,397
havin' blasted that little old rock to pieces
durin' Mrs<i>,</i> Munson's choir practice<i>,</i>

821
00:53:31,474 --> 00:53:35,501
Garth, can you run us through the
game plan for what remains of our tunnel?

822
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:39,675
Of course<i>,</i> Why, it's child's play now<i>,</i>
Easiest thing in the world<i>,</i>

823
00:53:39,749 --> 00:53:43,412
Only a couple of feet
separate us from the vault<i>,</i>

824
00:53:43,486 --> 00:53:46,978
Just the usual spadework
until we get to the masonry of the vault,

825
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,388
and then we just drill through<i>,</i>

826
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:53,157
And will you be able to wield the drill
with your maimed extremity?

827
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:57,064
Oh, well, yeah, I should think so<i>,</i>
Yeah, it's, uh, it's only one finger<i>,</i>

828
00:53:57,133 --> 00:54:02,366
Inhibits me in doing finer work of course<i>,</i>
I'll always have to live with that<i>,</i>

829
00:54:02,439 --> 00:54:04,373
<i>(clears throat)</i>

830
00:54:04,441 --> 00:54:06,909
Maybe - I'm just thinkin' out loud here -

831
00:54:06,977 --> 00:54:11,038
maybe, since as you say
there will be problems later,

832
00:54:11,114 --> 00:54:14,982
maybe - and I actually mentioned this
to Mountain Girl, she agrees with me,

833
00:54:15,051 --> 00:54:19,988
so it's not just one person's opinion -
maybe, uh<i>,,,</i>

834
00:54:20,056 --> 00:54:25,392
I should get a little extra compensation
for the accident<i>,</i>

835
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:32,497
Somewhat larger share<i>,</i>

836
00:54:33,837 --> 00:54:36,772
Why, if this was any other line of work,
I'd be getting workman's comp<i>,</i>

837
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:39,400
Wouldn't I?
Might even have a pretty good lawsuit<i>,</i>

838
00:54:39,476 --> 00:54:43,276
Wait, so you gonna sue yourself
for blowing your own goddamn finger off?

839
00:54:43,346 --> 00:54:46,076
- Well, now that is simply asinine<i>,</i>
- Yes, but you see, Garth,

840
00:54:46,149 --> 00:54:50,085
this is not what you just called
"some other line of work<i>,</i>"

841
00:54:50,153 --> 00:54:51,415
Yeah, no, no, no, but if it were<i>,,,</i>

842
00:54:51,488 --> 00:54:53,683
This is a criminal enterprise,
not to put too fine a point on it,

843
00:54:53,757 --> 00:54:56,954
entailing any manner of risk
not involved in honest labor<i>,</i>

844
00:54:57,027 --> 00:54:58,688
Governmental regulations
and civic safeguards

845
00:54:58,762 --> 00:55:02,721
cannot be assumed to apply
to antisocial pursuits<i>,</i>

846
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:06,701
- Yeah, but he lost his finger<i>,</i>
- We don't give a fuck!

847
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:10,035
That fool could blow his goddamn dick off,
it don't make no nevermind to us!

848
00:55:10,106 --> 00:55:13,075
We not payin' this jackass for goin' around
blowin' off goddamn body parts!

849
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,974
Get yo' fuckin' head out yo' ass, man!

850
00:55:15,045 --> 00:55:16,637
Look you, there is no call for<i>,,,</i>

851
00:55:16,713 --> 00:55:18,442
No extra share!

852
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:25,379
OK<i>,</i> Majority rules<i>,</i>

853
00:55:25,455 --> 00:55:29,118
Like I say, it was just a trial balloon<i>,</i>
Hand's not so bad really<i>,</i>

854
00:55:29,192 --> 00:55:30,159
I even get some phantom feeling<i>,</i>

855
00:55:30,226 --> 00:55:32,387
Yeah, you pull on your prick,
you get some phantom feelin'<i>,</i>

856
00:55:32,462 --> 00:55:33,429
- Fuck you<i>,</i>
- Fuck you<i>,</i>

857
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:35,828
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you, nubbie!

858
00:55:35,899 --> 00:55:37,799
Well, now that that matter is settled,

859
00:55:37,867 --> 00:55:41,268
why don't we synchronize our watches
before Gawain reports to work<i>,</i>

860
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:45,240
In 20 seconds, it will be exactly 12:16<i>,</i>

861
00:55:45,308 --> 00:55:48,175
- Fifteen<i>,,,</i>
- What, it'll be 12:15?

862
00:55:48,244 --> 00:55:52,476
No, 15 seconds<i>,</i> Well, 11 seconds now<i>,</i>
lt'll be 12:16<i>,</i>

863
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:56,379
- Eight, seven<i>,,,</i>
- Professor? Prof<i>,,,</i>?

864
00:55:56,453 --> 00:55:57,750
<i>- ,,,</i>six<i>,,,</i>
- Professor?

865
00:55:57,821 --> 00:56:00,016
<i>,,,</i>five<i>,,,</i>
Yes, Lump!

866
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:02,422
I don't have a watch<i>,</i>

867
00:56:04,394 --> 00:56:09,798
There'll be no more
weepin' and wailin'

868
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:13,768
No more weepin' and wailin'

869
00:56:13,937 --> 00:56:17,839
No more weepin' and wailin'

870
00:56:17,907 --> 00:56:21,638
Home to live with God
Oh<i>,,,</i>

Soon I will be done
with the troubles of this world

Troubles of this, great God!

Soon I will be done

883
00:57:05,121 --> 00:57:09,490
I'm goin' home to live with God

884
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:14,326
Well, I'm goin' up to see King Jesus
Hey, hey, yeah!

885
00:57:14,397 --> 00:57:16,865
I'm gonna shake His loving hand

886
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:21,370
I'm gonna tell Him all about my trouble

887
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:26,034
As I'm travelin' through this land!

888
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:29,340
Oh, soon I will be done

Whoo-hoo-hoo!

897
00:58:06,683 --> 00:58:09,208
Ain't that somethin'!

898

900
00:58:23,366 --> 00:58:26,824
Irritable Bowel Syndrome!
Is there a men's room down here?

901
00:58:26,903 --> 00:58:29,098
Oh, come on<i>,</i> You shouldn't be usin'
the men's room now!

902
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:31,299
Or a lady's room<i>, (sniffs)</i> Quickly<i>,</i>
I<i>,</i>B<i>,</i>S<i>,</i>

903
00:58:31,374 --> 00:58:33,308
If you knew you had the runs,
why didn't you shit back at the house?

904
00:58:33,376 --> 00:58:34,365
Quickly!

905
00:58:34,444 --> 00:58:36,776
We don't want Elron finding
your stinkin' ass on the crapper!

906
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:39,940
No choice<i>,</i>
It's a medical condition<i>,</i> Quickly!

907
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:43,008
You one disgustin' individual,
you know that?

908
00:58:43,086 --> 00:58:45,748
Come on<i>,</i>
Follow me<i>,</i>

909
00:58:46,756 --> 00:58:48,451
<i>(toilet flushes)</i>

910
00:58:53,763 --> 00:58:55,230
I feel 30 pounds lighter<i>,</i>

911
00:58:55,298 --> 00:58:59,257
- Come the fuck on with your stinkass<i>,</i>
- Thank you for being so understanding<i>,</i>

912
00:58:59,335 --> 00:59:02,600
Not everyone is, of course, which is why
the biggest challenge of I<i>,</i>B<i>,</i>S<i>,</i>

913
00:59:02,672 --> 00:59:05,300
is educating the public<i>,</i>

914
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:09,903
Afflicts over two million people,
yet most of us have never heard of it<i>,</i>

915
00:59:09,979 --> 00:59:13,176
And it strikes without regard to age,
gender or race<i>,</i>

916
00:59:13,249 --> 00:59:15,308
Oh, fuck, man,
I don't wanna hear about this shit<i>,</i>

917
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:18,183
Well, that's exactly the kind
of attitude we're fighting<i>,</i>

918
00:59:18,254 --> 00:59:21,587
I guess I never told you that's how
Mountain Girl and I met<i>,</i>

919
00:59:21,658 --> 00:59:25,150
They had an I<i>,</i>B<i>,</i>S<i>,</i> weekend
at Grossinger's up in the Catskills<i>,</i>

920
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:27,287
Of course, the tourist business
there has suffered

921
00:59:27,363 --> 00:59:29,593
with the demise of the Borscht Belt,

922
00:59:29,666 --> 00:59:33,363
so they have various promotions,
mixers, so on<i>,</i>

923
00:59:33,436 --> 00:59:38,738
This was a weekend for Irritable Bowel
singles to meet and support each other

924
00:59:38,808 --> 00:59:40,366
- and share stories<i>,</i>
- Man, look here,

925
00:59:40,443 --> 00:59:42,104
I don't want to hear
a single one of them stories, OK?

926
00:59:42,178 --> 00:59:45,079
- Now, some of them are very moving<i>,</i>
- Not one fucking story!

927
00:59:45,148 --> 00:59:50,176
- Look, I didn't choose to have I<i>,</i>B<i>,</i>S<i>,</i>
- Man, shut the fuck up!

928
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:54,349
There's no cure, you know<i>,</i>
Only control<i>,</i> Lifelong condition<i>,</i>

929
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:57,154
Yeah, you know what?
Bein' an asshole's a lifelong condition, too<i>,</i>

930
00:59:57,226 --> 00:59:59,194
Just drop the fuckin' tools<i>,</i>

931
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:01,753
I'm not complaining<i>,</i>
I did meet Mountain Girl<i>,</i>

932
01:00:01,831 --> 01:00:03,355
Man, get back in the fuckin' hole!

933
01:00:04,734 --> 01:00:09,797
Oh! <i>(laughs)</i> Marvel<i>,,,</i> Marvelous<i>,</i> Marv<i>,,,</i>
This way! This way, gentlemen!

934
01:00:09,872 --> 01:00:15,003
Oh! Excellent! Excellent<i>,</i>
Flawless, flawless<i>,</i> Thumbs up<i>,</i>

935
01:00:19,582 --> 01:00:23,643
Can't stop shittin'<i>,</i>
Can't stop talkin' about shittin'<i>,</i>

936
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:32,591
Gentlemen, to we few<i>,</i> We who have
shared each other's company,

937
01:00:32,662 --> 01:00:35,358
each other's cares, each other's joys,

938
01:00:35,431 --> 01:00:37,956
and who shall now reap the fruits
of our communal efforts,

939
01:00:38,034 --> 01:00:40,764
shoulder to shoulder,
from each according to his abilities,

940
01:00:40,837 --> 01:00:42,134
so forth and whatnot<i>,</i>

941
01:00:42,205 --> 01:00:44,969
We have had our little differences
along the way,

942
01:00:45,041 --> 01:00:49,341
but I'd like to think that they've only
made us value one another all the more<i>,</i>

943
01:00:49,412 --> 01:00:51,505
Each of us coming to understand
and appreciate

944
01:00:51,581 --> 01:00:56,985
the other's unique qualities
and potencies and, yes, foibles<i>,</i>

945
01:00:58,121 --> 01:01:03,252
I suggest that we shall
look back upon this little caper one day,

946
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:10,164
one distant day,
grandchildren dandled upon our knee,

947
01:01:10,233 --> 01:01:15,170
and perhaps a tear will form
and we shall say,

948
01:01:15,238 --> 01:01:20,301
"Well, with wit and grit
and no small amount of courage,

949
01:01:20,376 --> 01:01:24,710
we accomplished something on that day,

950
01:01:24,781 --> 01:01:30,413
a feat of derring-do,
an enterprise not ignoble<i>,</i>"

951
01:01:30,486 --> 01:01:35,719
We merry band, unbound
by the constraints of society

952
01:01:35,792 --> 01:01:39,489
and the prejudices of the common ruck<i>,</i>

953
01:01:39,562 --> 01:01:43,623
We happy few<i>,</i>

954
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:47,329
- Gentlemen, to us!
<i>- (all)</i> To us!

955
01:01:49,105 --> 01:01:50,697
<i>(laughter)</i>

956
01:01:55,511 --> 01:01:57,502
Charge shoulda gone off already<i>,</i>

957
01:01:57,714 --> 01:01:59,443
I do beg your pardon?

958
01:01:59,515 --> 01:02:03,383
The charge to collapse the tunnel<i>,</i>
I set it for eight minutes<i>,</i>

959
01:02:03,453 --> 01:02:08,015
Well, that much time and more
has certainly elapsed<i>,</i>

960
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:14,321
I need not remind you,
it is of the essence of this plan

961
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:17,059
that the money should appear to have
simply vanished without a trace,

962
01:02:17,133 --> 01:02:19,966
- spirited away, as it were, by ghosts<i>,</i>
- Of course<i>,</i>

963
01:02:20,036 --> 01:02:22,800
The conundrum of the undisturbed,
yet empty vault,

964
01:02:22,872 --> 01:02:25,705
the unsolvable riddle
of the sealed yet violated sanctum,

965
01:02:25,775 --> 01:02:27,003
is of the utmost importance,

966
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:30,409
not only to make our caper
more intellectually satisfying,

967
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:33,142
it is exigent as a matter of practical fact<i>,</i>

968
01:02:33,216 --> 01:02:38,882
I remind you that if any tunnel
is ever found leading to this house,

969
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:44,689
the owner knows all your names<i>,</i>

There's no hole left<i>,</i>

978
01:04:44,313 --> 01:04:46,713
Professor!

979
01:04:47,783 --> 01:04:49,546
I'm surprised!

01:04:49,619 --> 01:04:58,425
Well<i>,,,</i> uh<i>,,,</i> properly speaking, madam,
we are surprised<i>,</i> You are taken aback<i>,</i>

981
01:04:58,494 --> 01:05:00,724
Though I do acknowledge
that the sense that you intend

982
01:05:00,796 --> 01:05:05,495
is gaining increasing currency
through its use, yes<i>,</i>

983
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:08,867
You have returned from
your devotions betimes<i>,</i>

984
01:05:08,938 --> 01:05:10,405
I had to make tea<i>,</i>

985
01:05:10,473 --> 01:05:15,001
I want to talk to you, Professor,
so don't you be leavin'!

986
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:21,107
And you! I told you I don't want
any smokin' in this house!

01:06:02,758 --> 01:06:04,851
Now, I don't know what
you boys been up to,

but I know mischief when I see it<i>,</i>
Now, I want an explanation, but first,

995

I want you to get your fannies up here

01:06:13,002 --> 01:06:19,271
Now, I been tellin' the ladies about your
music, and they want to hear you play<i>,</i>

997
01:06:33,022 --> 01:06:36,458
- Professor?
- Yes, Lump?

998
01:06:36,692 --> 01:06:40,628
I can't really play the buttsack<i>,</i>

999
01:06:42,365 --> 01:06:44,265
<i>(chattering stops)</i>

1000
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:48,167
Madam, or rather, mesdames,

1001
01:06:48,237 --> 01:06:51,138
you must accept our apologies
for not bein' able to perform,

1002
01:06:51,207 --> 01:06:53,300
for, as you see, we are shorthanded<i>,</i>

1003
01:06:53,376 --> 01:06:56,004
Gawain is still at work,

1004
01:06:56,078 --> 01:06:58,979
and we could no more play
with one part tacit

1005
01:06:59,048 --> 01:07:02,814
than a horse could canter shy one leg<i>,</i>

1006
01:07:06,255 --> 01:07:09,349
Perhaps I could offer,

1007
01:07:09,425 --> 01:07:15,989
as a poor but ready substitute,
a brief poetic recital<i>,</i>

1008
01:07:16,065 --> 01:07:22,026
Though I do not pretend
to any great oratorical skills, <i>(laughs)</i>

1009
01:07:22,104 --> 01:07:25,631
I would be happy to present,
with your ladies' permission,

1010
01:07:26,609 --> 01:07:31,842
verse from the unquiet mind
of Mr<i>,</i> Edgar Allan Poe<i>,</i>

1011
01:07:39,455 --> 01:07:45,018
"Ladies, thy beauty is to me

1012
01:07:45,094 --> 01:07:48,757
Like those Nicean barks of yore,

1013
01:07:48,831 --> 01:07:57,102
That gently, o'er a perfumed sea,
The weary, wayworn wanderer bore

1014
01:07:57,173 --> 01:08:00,870
To his own native shore<i>,</i>"

1015
01:08:00,943 --> 01:08:03,741
<i>- (ladies sigh)</i>
- My, my, my<i>,</i>

1016
01:08:04,213 --> 01:08:08,673
"On desperate seas long wont to roam,

1017
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:15,156
Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face,

1018
01:08:16,725 --> 01:08:20,354
Thy Naiad airs have brought me home

1019
01:08:20,429 --> 01:08:27,062
To the glory that was Greece
And the grandeur that was Rome<i>,</i>"

1020
01:08:28,037 --> 01:08:29,937
<i>(tea lady #1)</i> Glory hallelujah<i>,</i>

1021
01:08:30,005 --> 01:08:31,438
<i>(all)</i> Amen!

1022
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:38,704
Hm?

1023
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:42,308
<i>(Dorr)</i> Bye-bye, ladies<i>,</i>
It was<i>,,,</i> it was my pleasure<i>,</i>

1024
01:08:42,384 --> 01:08:45,876
<i>- (tea lady #1)</i> We have to do this again<i>,</i>
<i>- (tea lady #2)</i> Yes, we do got to<i>,</i>

1025
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:48,822
Such a pleasure<i>,</i>
Safe home<i>,</i> Safe home<i>,</i>

1026
01:08:48,891 --> 01:08:50,381
<i>(Mrs. Munson chuckles)</i>

1027
01:08:50,459 --> 01:08:53,394
- Now I want to know what's goin' on<i>,</i>
- Oh, indeed, indeed<i>,</i>

1028
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:56,761
The thirst for knowledge
is a very commendable thing<i>,</i>

1029
01:08:57,299 --> 01:09:02,760
Though I do believe that when you hear
the explanation you shall laugh riotously,

1030
01:09:02,838 --> 01:09:07,434
slappin' your knee and perhaps even
wipin' away a giddy tear,

1031
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:09,740
relieved of your former concern<i>,</i>

1032
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:13,407
Lump here is an avid collector
of Indian arrowheads,

1033
01:09:13,616 --> 01:09:18,019
and having found one
simply lying on your cellar floor -

1034
01:09:18,087 --> 01:09:20,317
- a particularly rare artifact
of the Natchez tribe? - 

1035
01:09:20,389 --> 01:09:21,253
Nats<i>,,,</i> what?

1036
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:25,589
He enlisted the entire ensemble in
an all-out effort to sift through the subsoil

1037
01:09:25,661 --> 01:09:27,322
in search of others<i>,</i>

1038
01:09:27,396 --> 01:09:30,923
And apparently, in doing so,
we hit a mother lode of natural gas<i>,</i>

1039
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,663
I myself became acutely aware
of the smell of "rotten eggs<i>,</i>"

1040
01:09:34,737 --> 01:09:37,831
And it was just at this inopportune moment

1041
01:09:37,907 --> 01:09:42,435
that the General here
violated the cardinal rule of this house

1042
01:09:42,645 --> 01:09:47,548
- and lit himself a cigarette<i>,</i>
- So sorry<i>,</i>

1043
01:09:50,219 --> 01:09:53,620
Well, what about all that money?

1044
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:54,678
Ah<i>,</i>

1045
01:09:55,991 --> 01:10:00,325
The money<i>,</i>
Well, the money is Mr<i>,</i> Pancake's<i>,</i>

1046
01:10:00,396 --> 01:10:03,991
<i>- (clears throat)</i> That's right<i>,</i>
- Who only just remortgaged his home

1047
01:10:04,066 --> 01:10:07,126
in order to raise the money
for a surgical procedure

1048
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:11,037
that will correct the wandering eye
of his common-law wife, Mountain Water,

1049
01:10:11,106 --> 01:10:18,672
who suffers from astigmia, strabismus
and a general curdling of the vitreous jelly<i>,</i>

1050
01:10:18,747 --> 01:10:24,117
Mr<i>,</i> Pancake is an ardent foe
of the Federal Reserve,

1051
01:10:24,186 --> 01:10:26,984
and is, in fact, one of those eccentrics
one often reads about

1052
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:29,024
hoardin' his entire life savings,

1053
01:10:29,091 --> 01:10:35,496
in Mr<i>,</i> Pancake 's case, in a Hefty bag
that is his constant companion<i>,</i>

1054
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:41,400
- The Steel Sak<i>,</i>
- Don't trust the banks<i>,</i> Never have<i>,</i>

1055
01:10:48,777 --> 01:10:50,210
Mm-mn<i>,</i>

1056
01:10:50,279 --> 01:10:52,179
It don't smell right to me<i>,</i>

1057
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:55,445
- I'm callin' Sheriff Wyner<i>,</i>
- No! Madam!

1058
01:10:55,517 --> 01:10:57,212
Please, please<i>,</i>
Madam!

1059
01:10:57,286 --> 01:11:00,050
No, no, I beg of<i>,,,</i>
Yes! Yes!

1060
01:11:00,122 --> 01:11:02,852
It is a lie!
It is a fantastic tale!

1061
01:11:02,925 --> 01:11:06,053
You have us dead to rights,
but, madam, please, please, please

1062
01:11:06,128 --> 01:11:10,189
allow me to tell you the truth in private<i>,</i>

1063
01:11:13,469 --> 01:11:15,664
Madam<i>,,,</i>

1064
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:24,239
Madam, we are not musicians
of the late Renaissance<i>,</i>

1065
01:11:24,313 --> 01:11:27,510
- Nor of the early, nor mid period<i>,</i>
- Mm-hm<i>,</i>

1066
01:11:28,183 --> 01:11:32,381
We are, in fact,

1067
01:11:32,454 --> 01:11:34,615
criminals<i>,</i>

1068
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:37,386
Desperate men, Mrs<i>,</i> Munson<i>,</i>

1069
01:11:37,459 --> 01:11:45,389
We have tunneled into the nearby offices
of the Bandit Queen gambling emporium

1070
01:11:45,467 --> 01:11:49,767
- and relieved it of its treasure<i>,</i>
- Lord have mercy<i>,</i>

1071
01:11:49,838 --> 01:11:51,032
It is true<i>,</i>

1072
01:11:51,106 --> 01:11:54,098
The Bandit Queen is a den of iniquity,

1073
01:11:54,176 --> 01:11:58,442
a painted harlot luring people into sin
by exciting the vice of greed

1074
01:11:58,514 --> 01:12:01,415
with her promise of easy winnings<i>,</i>
Oh, yes<i>,</i>

1075
01:12:01,483 --> 01:12:04,418
Her gains are ill-gotten<i>,</i>

1076
01:12:05,087 --> 01:12:12,653
But, I offer no excuses - save one<i>,</i>

1077
01:12:12,728 --> 01:12:17,097
We men have each pledged
one half of our share of the booty

1078
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:18,929
to a charitable institution<i>,</i>

1079
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:21,492
In compensation for the use of your home,

1080
01:12:21,570 --> 01:12:28,635
we had planned to donate a full share
to Bob Jones University,

1081
01:12:28,711 --> 01:12:33,148
without burdening you with guilty
knowledge by informing you of same<i>,</i>

1082
01:12:33,215 --> 01:12:37,049
But now you have wrested
the information from me<i>,</i>

1083
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:40,520
There you have it<i>,</i>
It is on your table, Mrs<i>,</i> Munson<i>,</i>

1084
01:12:40,589 --> 01:12:44,150
The "awful truth<i>,</i>"

1085
01:12:44,226 --> 01:12:49,254
- Stolen money<i>,</i>
- But find the victim, Mrs<i>,</i> Munson<i>,</i>

1086
01:12:49,331 --> 01:12:53,427
I challenge you<i>,</i> Even the casino itself,
that riparian Gomorrah,

1087
01:12:53,502 --> 01:12:55,470
shall suffer no harm<i>,</i>

1088
01:12:55,537 --> 01:12:58,631
It has an insurance company<i>,</i>

1089
01:12:58,707 --> 01:13:04,077
A financial behemoth that will
cheerfully replenish its depleted vaults<i>,</i>

1090
01:13:04,146 --> 01:13:05,670
That is its function<i>,</i>

1091
01:13:05,748 --> 01:13:11,050
And that insurance company has tens
and tens of thousands of policyholders<i>,</i>

1092
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:13,384
So that<i>,,,</i> We have done the calculations,
Mrs<i>,</i> Munson<i>,</i>

1093
01:13:13,455 --> 01:13:16,686
So that at the end of the day,
at the final reckoning,

1094
01:13:16,759 --> 01:13:22,163
each and every one of those policyholders
shall have contributed one penny<i>,</i>

1095
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:28,227
One, single, solitary cent
to the satisfaction of this claim<i>,</i>

1096
01:13:28,303 --> 01:13:32,569
- One penny?
- One penny<i>,</i> Think of it, Mrs<i>,</i> Munson<i>,</i>

1097
01:13:32,641 --> 01:13:37,635
One penny from those thousands
upon thousands of people

1098
01:13:37,713 --> 01:13:44,118
so that Bob Jones University
can continue on its mission<i>,</i>

1099
01:13:44,186 --> 01:13:46,780
Why, I have no doubt that,
were those policy holders made aware

1100
01:13:46,855 --> 01:13:50,086
of the existence of that august institution,
each and every one of them

1101
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:55,028
would have volunteered some token
amount for the furtherance of its aims<i>,</i>

1102
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:57,031
Well, that's prob'ly true<i>,</i>

1103
01:13:57,099 --> 01:14:03,368
Sadly, the criminal stain
is upon my soul,

1104
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:08,536
but the benefit shall accrue
to any number of worthy causes

1105
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:13,946
as long, that is, as the secret
stays with us<i>,</i>

1106
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:19,387
Well<i>,,,</i>

1107
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:23,448
I can't hardly see the harm in it<i>,</i>

1108
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:26,451
- One penny?
<i>- (mouthing)</i> One penny<i>,</i>

1109
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:40,772
- I'm sorry<i>,</i>
- Excuse me?

1110
01:14:40,843 --> 01:14:44,279
No, I'm sorry, it's wrong, and don't you
be leadin' me into temptation<i>,</i>

1111
01:14:44,346 --> 01:14:47,440
- No, no, madam, I must strenuously<i>,,,</i>
- I'm sorry, it's just plain wrong<i>,</i>

1112
01:14:47,516 --> 01:14:48,778
- Stealin'!
- No, madam<i>,,,</i>

1113
01:14:48,851 --> 01:14:51,376
- I know your intentions was good<i>,</i>
- No, they weren't!

1114
01:14:51,453 --> 01:14:54,354
And I won't call the police
if you give back the money

1115
01:14:54,423 --> 01:14:56,288
and y'all go to church with me
next Sunday<i>,</i>

1116
01:14:56,358 --> 01:15:01,022
And engage in divine worship?!

1117
01:15:01,096 --> 01:15:04,088
I've made up my mind<i>,</i>

1118
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:09,661
Now, you can doubletalk all you want<i>,</i>
It's church or the county jail<i>,</i>

1119
01:15:09,738 --> 01:15:13,401
Think it over<i>,</i>
I gotta feed the cat<i>,</i>

1120
01:15:23,252 --> 01:15:25,652
<i>(plucks strings)</i>

1121
01:15:31,393 --> 01:15:34,385
- Motherfuck!
- Yes<i>,</i>

1122
01:15:34,463 --> 01:15:37,955
Unfortunately, Mrs<i>,</i> Munson
has rather complicated the situation<i>,</i>

1123
01:15:38,033 --> 01:15:40,467
Yeah, well, I know how to decomplicate it<i>,</i>

1124
01:15:40,669 --> 01:15:45,572
You bust a cap in that old bitch's head,
everything be simple<i>,</i>

1125
01:15:48,143 --> 01:15:52,375
Not easy to do<i>,</i>
Many reasons<i>,</i>

1126
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:56,349
Practical ones:
Quiet neighborhood, sleepy town<i>,</i>

1127
01:15:56,418 --> 01:15:59,410
Reasons of moral repugnance:
A harmless woman,

1128
01:15:59,488 --> 01:16:02,218
a deed conceived
and executed in cold blood<i>,</i>

1129
01:16:02,291 --> 01:16:05,692
Oh, no, Gawain,
would that it were simple<i>,</i>

1130
01:16:05,761 --> 01:16:09,197
Well, fuck, man! What we gonna do?
Give the money back and go to church?

1131
01:16:11,066 --> 01:16:14,467
I shudder<i>,</i>
I quake<i>,</i>

1132
01:16:15,203 --> 01:16:17,728
You, sir, are a Buddhist<i>,</i>

1133
01:16:17,806 --> 01:16:20,240
Is there not a "middle" way?

1134
01:16:20,309 --> 01:16:22,675
Mm<i>,</i>

1135
01:16:25,647 --> 01:16:29,242
Must float like a leaf on the river of life<i>,,,</i>

1136
01:16:30,919 --> 01:16:33,183
<i>,,,</i>and kill old lady<i>,</i>

1137
01:16:35,857 --> 01:16:38,792
Yes, yes, I suppose you are right<i>,</i>

1138
01:16:38,860 --> 01:16:42,921
It is the active nature of the crime,
though, that so abhors<i>,</i>

1139
01:16:42,998 --> 01:16:45,364
The squeezing of the trigger,
the plunging of the knife<i>,</i>

1140
01:16:47,970 --> 01:16:50,996
But<i>,,,</i> let us think a moment<i>,</i>

1141
01:16:51,073 --> 01:16:54,372
What other tools do we have at hand?

1142
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:56,411
We have the cellar<i>,</i>

1143
01:16:56,478 --> 01:16:58,810
We have the cavity<i>,</i>

1144
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:03,249
We have masonry and trowel<i>,</i>

1145
01:17:03,318 --> 01:17:09,951
Perhaps we could simply<i>,,,</i> immure her<i>,</i>

1146
01:17:10,025 --> 01:17:13,461
Sure<i>,</i> Easiest thing in the world<i>,</i> I can
whip up a little mortar in a snow saucer<i>,</i>

1147
01:17:13,528 --> 01:17:16,361
Lay the bricks<i>,</i>
Anchor in some chains<i>,</i>

1148
01:17:16,431 --> 01:17:18,126
Mountain Girl could outsource
the manacles<i>,</i>

1149
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:21,636
Ah, gentlemen, gentlemen,
we delude ourselves<i>,</i>

1150
01:17:21,703 --> 01:17:25,639
No, shortest and painless is best<i>,</i>

1151
01:17:26,341 --> 01:17:32,905
Gawain's gun, retort muffled
by a pillow, into the brain<i>,</i>

1152
01:17:32,981 --> 01:17:34,471
<i>(claps)</i>
The affair of an instant<i>,</i>

1153
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:40,987
The only question is
who wields the weapon?

1154
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:45,821
I believe it is traditional
in such circumstances to draw straws<i>,</i>

1155
01:17:46,595 --> 01:17:49,621
Fair enough<i>,</i>
Here you go, Lump<i>,</i>

1156
01:17:50,866 --> 01:17:54,165
I'm thinkin', though,
that since I lost a finger -

1157
01:17:54,803 --> 01:17:58,534
- and I mean literally lost it
'cause of that fuckin' cat -

1158
01:17:58,607 --> 01:18:01,974
maybe I should be
excused from this thing<i>,</i>

1159
01:18:02,044 --> 01:18:04,012
Hard for me to squeeze a trigger anyway<i>,</i>

1160
01:18:04,079 --> 01:18:06,309
You one whiny muthafucka<i>,</i>

1161
01:18:06,381 --> 01:18:09,612
I'll come over there and squeeze your
fuckin' nutsack, you keep that bullshit up<i>,</i>

1162
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:11,118
Shut up, punk!

1163
01:18:11,186 --> 01:18:13,017
- I'll kick your goddamn ass, sweet-legs!
- Gentlemen!

1164
01:18:13,088 --> 01:18:15,682
No special pleading<i>,</i>
No exceptions<i>,</i>

1165
01:18:15,757 --> 01:18:19,352
It is of the nature of the situation
we would all prefer to be excused<i>,</i>

1166
01:18:20,462 --> 01:18:22,794
Well, OK, it was just a trial balloon<i>,</i>

1167
01:19:01,103 --> 01:19:06,063
Long straw<i>,</i> You all see it<i>,</i>
All that fuss for nothin', punk<i>,</i>

1168
01:19:06,141 --> 01:19:08,132
Fuck you<i>,</i>

1169
01:19:22,324 --> 01:19:23,416

1175

<i>Lord, I'm troubled</i>

1177

<i>- No, just an explanation.</i>

1178
01:20:01,897 --> 01:20:03,228
<i>Coming up!</i>

1179

<i>- Hi, George.</i>

1180
01:20:06,334 --> 01:20:07,392
<i>What's goin' on?</i>

1181
01:20:07,469 --> 01:20:11,200
<i>George!</i>
<i>How did they get in here?!</i>

- What you got there, Gawain?
- Why, nothin', Mama<i>,</i>

1184
01:20:19,347 --> 01:20:23,078
Nothin', my ass!
You got a dog there!

1185
01:20:23,151 --> 01:20:27,281
- No, Mama<i>,</i>
- A filthy, noisy little pest of a puppy dog

1186

- He won't shit in the house, Mama<i>,</i>

1187
01:20:30,425 --> 01:20:33,019
I'm gonna train him, I promise<i>,</i>
I'll train him real good!

1188
01:20:33,094 --> 01:20:35,221
I'm gonna train you real good!

1189
01:20:35,297 --> 01:20:39,256
You wait till your daddy get home<i>,</i>
He gonna lay into you proper!

1190
01:20:39,334 --> 01:20:41,962
No, Mama! Please, Mama! I love you!

1191
01:20:42,037 --> 01:20:43,937
Your daddy gonna kick yo' ass!

1192

Mama's whuppin' Gawain's ass!

Ain't you gonna use the strap, Mama?

1194
01:20:48,543 --> 01:20:52,570
I love you, Mama<i>,</i>
I'm sorry, Mama, I love you<i>,</i>

- What you doin'?

1198
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:07,321
What you doin' with my pillow?

1199

- Fine colored boy like you

- fallin' in with that trash downstairs!
- Ugh!

1203
01:21:16,004 --> 01:21:19,838
Now, I know your mama
taught you better than that!

1204
01:21:23,745 --> 01:21:27,806
I can't do it<i>,</i>
She remind me of my mama<i>,</i>

1205
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:30,545
- Look, man<i>,,,</i>
- Why, this is most irregular<i>,</i>

1206
01:21:30,619 --> 01:21:32,849
<i>,,,</i>y'all muthafuckas
just gonna have to draw straws again<i>,</i>

1207
01:21:32,921 --> 01:21:36,015
Wait a minute<i>,</i> You've got to accept
your responsibilities, young man,

1208
01:21:36,091 --> 01:21:37,524
and shoot that old lady<i>,</i>

1209
01:21:37,592 --> 01:21:40,060
Hey, man, fuck you
and your irritated bowel!

1210
01:21:40,128 --> 01:21:41,322
Must shoot<i>,</i>

1211
01:21:41,396 --> 01:21:42,795
Now, look here,
it's the easiest thing in the world<i>,</i>

1212
01:21:42,864 --> 01:21:46,891
Just pretend her head's a casaba melon
and the gun is a melon baller<i>,</i>

1213
01:21:46,968 --> 01:21:49,368
What the fuck are you talkin' about?
A melon baller?

1214
01:21:49,437 --> 01:21:52,429
- Look, man, you do it<i>,</i>
- Oh, this is most irregular<i>,</i>

1215
01:21:52,507 --> 01:21:56,307
Now, look, with equal rights
comes equal responsibility<i>,</i>

1216
01:21:56,378 --> 01:21:59,211
I'm afraid Mr<i>,</i> Pancake is correct<i>,</i>
We cannot draw straws again<i>,</i>

1217
01:21:59,281 --> 01:22:04,048
The exercise would lose all credibility
if you show the loser can simply beg off<i>,</i>

1218
01:22:04,119 --> 01:22:05,984
Must shoot<i>,</i>

1219

Hey, look, man,
she's just an old colored lady to you<i>,</i>

Come on, man, you do it<i>,</i>

1221
01:22:12,427 --> 01:22:17,364
- Why, you sniveling little coward<i>,</i>
- What did you say to me?

1222
01:22:17,432 --> 01:22:20,526
- Sniveling little coward<i>,</i>
- You whiny muthafucka<i>,</i>

1223
01:22:20,602 --> 01:22:23,765
I will come up yo' stankin',
irritated asshole with this gun

1224
01:22:23,838 --> 01:22:25,738
and give you a lead colonic,
muthafucka!

1225
01:22:25,807 --> 01:22:28,173
You think you scare me,
you mewling punk?

1226
01:22:28,243 --> 01:22:32,077
You don't scare me<i>,</i> Bull Connor
and all his dogs didn't scare me!

1227
01:22:32,147 --> 01:22:34,240
Now, be a man<i>,</i>

1228
01:22:34,316 --> 01:22:38,013
You fuck!
You ain't no fuckin' man!

1229
01:22:38,086 --> 01:22:40,384
- Oh, my, this is most distressin'<i>,</i>
- Be a man!

1230
01:22:40,455 --> 01:22:43,686
You ain't no fuckin' man!
Fuckin' a 60-year-old with pigtails!

1231
01:22:43,758 --> 01:22:47,489
Why, you bastard punk!
Mountain Girl is 53!

1232
01:22:47,696 --> 01:22:50,096
- She could ride your ass to jelly!

1235
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:55,960

I'll just check the carotid artery<i>,</i>

1242
01:23:24,599 --> 01:23:27,500
- That's a negative<i>,</i>
- Is he dead, Professor?

1243
01:23:27,569 --> 01:23:30,299
Oh, sure he's dead, Lump<i>,</i>
I just checked his carotid artery<i>,</i>

1244
01:23:30,372 --> 01:23:32,966
<i>(Dorr)</i> Well, this is most irregular<i>,</i>

1245
01:23:34,376 --> 01:23:36,469
We shall need a Hefty bag<i>,</i>

1246
01:23:44,819 --> 01:23:46,787
She is in the kitchen<i>,</i>

You steal out with the carcass
while I dazzle her with conversation<i>,</i>

1248
01:23:56,998 --> 01:24:03,631
My dear Mrs<i>,</i> Munson, I have outlined
your position with my colleagues,

1249
01:24:03,705 --> 01:24:08,074
and I now return to you
to render our collective verdict<i>,</i>

1250
01:24:08,143 --> 01:24:13,376
There was much spirited discussion
and an atmosphere of frank give-and-take<i>,</i>

1251
01:24:13,448 --> 01:24:15,882
Some of our number
were initially appalled at your proposal

1252
01:24:15,950 --> 01:24:19,044
that we simply return the money<i>,</i>
Some were more receptive<i>,</i>

1253
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:21,486
I don't care if they was receptive or not!

1254
01:24:21,556 --> 01:24:24,354
And that attitude, madam,
was a factor in our discussions<i>,</i>

1255
01:24:24,426 --> 01:24:28,362
To a man, I must say
they were devastated at the prospect

1256
01:24:28,430 --> 01:24:31,092
of not being able to contribute
to their respective charities<i>,</i>

1257
01:24:31,166 --> 01:24:33,259
- Well, that is a shame<i>,</i>
- Indeed,

1258
01:24:33,334 --> 01:24:37,293
but at the end of the day,
your position prevailed<i>,</i>

1259
01:24:37,372 --> 01:24:41,138
So we have decided to return the money,
every last cent of it,

1260
01:24:41,209 --> 01:24:45,043
and attend Sunday services, rather than
spend the remainder of our days

1261
01:24:45,113 --> 01:24:47,377

Men's Correctional Facility<i>,</i>

our respective functions in this enterprise<i>,</i>

You, Lump, are the goon,

whose actions must be directed

A nice old lady like that<i>,</i>

Yeah, I know, but<i>,,,</i>

1322
01:31:26,147 --> 01:31:29,947
And reflect also that if you decline to act,
thus forcin' me to do so,

you shall no longer have

Well, a bunch of desperate men

And I guess I made 'em feel real bad,

'cause they just picked up and left

Could I just give it all
