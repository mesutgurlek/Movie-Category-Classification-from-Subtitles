1
00:05:03,753 --> 00:05:06,449
I know he can get the job,
but can he do the job?

2
00:05:12,028 --> 00:05:15,191
Yeah, Harry, but can he do the job?

3
00:05:16,132 --> 00:05:18,464
I know he can get the job...

4
00:05:19,135 --> 00:05:21,126
...but can he do the job?

5
00:05:22,805 --> 00:05:24,796
I'm not arguing that with you.

6
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:29,200
I'm not arguing that with you.

7
00:05:31,514 --> 00:05:33,505
I'm not arguing that with you.

8
00:05:34,617 --> 00:05:37,211
I'm not arguing that with you, Harry!

9
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,781
Yeah, but can he do the job?

10
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:48,422
I know he can get the job,
but can he do the job?

11
00:05:49,532 --> 00:05:51,557
I'm not arguing that with you.

12
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,934
Harry, I'm not arguing that with you!

13
00:05:55,872 --> 00:05:59,501
Who said that? I didn't say that.

14
00:05:59,976 --> 00:06:02,638
If I said that, I would have been wrong.

15
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,111
I'm not arguing that with you!

16
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:14,856
Yeah, Harry, I know he can get the job,
but can he do the job?

17
00:06:15,758 --> 00:06:17,885
I am not arguing that with you!

18
00:06:19,695 --> 00:06:22,186
I am not arguing that with you!

19
00:06:25,034 --> 00:06:27,867
I am not arguing that with you!

20
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:32,373
Who told you that? No!

21
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:35,742
I told you that! Me!

22
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:38,242
What? Maybe.

23
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:40,977
Maybe, maybe.

24
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:38,404
- Good morning, DeDe.
- Hi, Joe.

25
00:07:38,975 --> 00:07:40,442
What's with the shoe?

26
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,943
I'm losing my sole.

27
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,041
How are you?

28
00:07:46,816 --> 00:07:48,545
Kind of tired.

29
00:07:51,154 --> 00:07:54,248
Here. Each one gets sent five catalogues.

30
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,581
No, I can't do it.

31
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,449
Why not?

32
00:07:58,594 --> 00:08:01,188
I only have 12 catalogues left.

33
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,257
Okay.

34
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,867
I'll take care of this.

35
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:15,839
How you doing?

36
00:08:16,812 --> 00:08:19,975
Well, I'm not feeling very good, Mr. Waturi.

37
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,008
What's new? You never feel good.

38
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:25,315
Well, that's a problem.

39
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:29,986
- I have a doctor's appointment today.
- Another doctor's appointment?

40
00:08:31,694 --> 00:08:34,857
What's this DeDe tells me
about the catalogues?

41
00:08:35,464 --> 00:08:38,627
- I only have 12.
- How'd you let that happen?

42
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,258
- I told you.
- When?

43
00:08:41,204 --> 00:08:43,832
Three weeks ago, then two weeks ago.

44
00:08:44,173 --> 00:08:45,936
Did you tell me last week?

45
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:48,574
No.

46
00:08:48,644 --> 00:08:50,771
- Why not?
- I thought you knew.

47
00:08:50,846 --> 00:08:54,282
Not good enough, Joe.
Not nearly good enough!

48
00:08:54,884 --> 00:08:59,412
- I put you in charge of the entire library.
- This room.

49
00:08:59,655 --> 00:09:02,453
I gave you carte blank in here.

50
00:09:02,525 --> 00:09:05,688
You put the orders in the printer, not me.

51
00:09:05,861 --> 00:09:10,025
You're not competent to put orders
into the printer. It's a very technical job.

52
00:09:10,199 --> 00:09:13,430
- You were going to explain it to me.
- Better than that.

53
00:09:13,903 --> 00:09:17,202
I was going to make you
assistant manager.

54
00:09:17,506 --> 00:09:22,603
I want to make you assistant manager.
But you're not flexible. You're inflexible.

55
00:09:23,112 --> 00:09:26,206
- I don't feel inflexible.
- You're inflexible! Totally.

56
00:09:28,284 --> 00:09:31,617
Another doctor's appointment?
You're always going to the doctor!

57
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:34,312
- I don't feel good.
- So what?

58
00:09:35,057 --> 00:09:36,649
You think I feel good?

59
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,488
Nobody feels good.

60
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:44,323
After childhood, it's a fact of life.
I feel rotten. So what?

61
00:09:44,767 --> 00:09:48,032
I don't let it bother me
or interfere with my job.

62
00:09:48,271 --> 00:09:50,000
What do you want from me?

63
00:09:50,072 --> 00:09:54,406
You're like a child. What's the lamp for?
Isn't there enough light in here for you?

64
00:09:55,411 --> 00:09:59,006
Fluorescents affect me.
They make me feel blotchy and...

65
00:09:59,482 --> 00:10:02,383
- ... puffy. I thought this light-
- Get rid of it.

66
00:10:04,553 --> 00:10:07,886
This is not your bedroom, Joe.
This is an office.

67
00:10:08,557 --> 00:10:13,221
If you treat this like a job instead
of a welfare hospital, you'll shape up!

68
00:10:15,431 --> 00:10:17,922
I want those catalogues.

69
00:10:18,901 --> 00:10:21,563
- Then, please, order them.
- Watch yourself.

70
00:10:22,738 --> 00:10:24,638
Think about what I just said.

71
00:10:24,807 --> 00:10:28,243
You've got to get yourself
into a flexible frame...

72
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,478
...or else you are no place.

73
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:38,379
And take that light off the desk.

74
00:10:39,655 --> 00:10:41,316
- I will.
- Do it now.

75
00:10:51,801 --> 00:10:52,893
Good.

76
00:11:03,446 --> 00:11:06,472
- Why do you let him talk to you like that?
- Like what?

77
00:11:07,283 --> 00:11:09,877
- What's wrong with you?
- I don't feel good.

78
00:11:09,985 --> 00:11:12,852
- What's the matter with you?
- I don't know.

79
00:11:15,691 --> 00:11:17,352
I don't know.

80
00:11:19,495 --> 00:11:20,655
<i>Mr. Banks?</i>

81
00:11:31,006 --> 00:11:33,668
Dr. Ellison will see you now.

82
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,763
How are you feeling, Mr. Banks?

83
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:08,702
The same. I feel puffy and blotchy.
I never have any energy.

84
00:12:09,044 --> 00:12:13,378
I keep getting sore throats.
I just don't feel very good.

85
00:12:13,616 --> 00:12:15,481
How long have you felt this way?

86
00:12:15,551 --> 00:12:18,384
Pretty much since
I left the fire department.

87
00:12:18,954 --> 00:12:21,616
On and off since then. About eight years.

88
00:12:21,924 --> 00:12:24,290
What did you do in the fire department?

89
00:12:25,394 --> 00:12:27,919
You know, I put out fires.

90
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,328
Was it dangerous?

91
00:12:29,398 --> 00:12:33,391
Yeah, there was some pretty rough stuff,
but I came out of it okay.

92
00:12:33,969 --> 00:12:38,463
The hard part was when I started
never feeling good and had to quit.

93
00:12:40,876 --> 00:12:43,367
I've gotten the results of your tests.

94
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:46,780
I have cancer.

95
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:48,480
No.

96
00:12:48,617 --> 00:12:50,915
Something is wrong
with my blood or urine?

97
00:12:50,986 --> 00:12:52,317
They're fine.

98
00:12:53,989 --> 00:12:55,752
But there is something.

99
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,723
- Tell me.
- You have a brain cloud.

100
00:13:01,931 --> 00:13:03,091
Brain cloud?

101
00:13:03,165 --> 00:13:06,999
A black fog of tissue
running down the center of your brain.

102
00:13:07,803 --> 00:13:09,293
It's very rare.

103
00:13:09,772 --> 00:13:12,832
It'll spread at a regular rate.
It's very destructive.

104
00:13:14,176 --> 00:13:15,507
And it's incurable?

105
00:13:17,012 --> 00:13:18,172
Yes.

106
00:13:28,757 --> 00:13:29,883
How long?

107
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:32,951
Six months.
You can count on it being about that.

108
00:13:33,496 --> 00:13:34,895
It's not painful.

109
00:13:35,264 --> 00:13:38,631
Your brain will simply fail,
followed abruptly by your body.

110
00:13:40,102 --> 00:13:43,367
You can depend on at least
four or five months of perfect health.

111
00:13:43,939 --> 00:13:47,102
What are you talking about?
I don't feel good now.

112
00:13:47,209 --> 00:13:51,475
That's the ironic part.
Mr. Banks, you're a hypochondriac.

113
00:13:51,981 --> 00:13:54,973
Nothing is wrong that has
anything to do with your symptoms.

114
00:13:55,684 --> 00:13:59,745
I think your experiences
in the fire department were traumatic.

115
00:14:00,022 --> 00:14:03,583
You experienced the imminent possibility
of death several times.

116
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,251
- Yeah.
- You survived.

117
00:14:07,296 --> 00:14:11,562
The cumulative anxiety of those brushes
with death left you habitually fearful...

118
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,764
...about your physical person.

119
00:14:14,904 --> 00:14:17,737
I'm not sick except for a terminal disease?

120
00:14:17,806 --> 00:14:20,138
Which has no symptoms. That's right.

121
00:14:20,409 --> 00:14:25,073
It was because of your insistence
on so many tests that we discovered it.

122
00:14:33,822 --> 00:14:35,312
What'll I do?

123
00:14:38,594 --> 00:14:42,257
If you have any savings,
you might think about taking a trip.

124
00:14:42,865 --> 00:14:45,959
- A vacation.
- I have no savings.

125
00:14:46,168 --> 00:14:49,797
A few hundred bucks.
I spent everything I had on doctors!

126
00:14:51,941 --> 00:14:54,273
Perhaps you'll want a second opinion.

127
00:14:57,179 --> 00:14:58,669
Brain cloud.

128
00:14:59,181 --> 00:15:03,345
I knew it. I didn't know it, but I knew it.

129
00:15:12,027 --> 00:15:13,619
What am I going to do?

130
00:15:19,034 --> 00:15:21,468
You have some time left, Mr. Banks.

131
00:15:22,705 --> 00:15:24,366
You have some life left.

132
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,142
My advice to you is:

133
00:15:29,478 --> 00:15:31,070
Live it well.

134
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,012
No.

135
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,086
You were wrong.

136
00:18:35,898 --> 00:18:37,229
He was wrong.

137
00:18:39,334 --> 00:18:41,461
Who said that? I didn't say that.

138
00:18:44,173 --> 00:18:47,165
If I said that, I would have been wrong.

139
00:18:48,243 --> 00:18:51,007
I would have been wrong, isn't that right?

140
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,354
I'm not arguing that with you.

141
00:19:03,592 --> 00:19:05,856
I'm not arguing that with you.

142
00:19:09,264 --> 00:19:11,858
I'm not arguing that with you!

143
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,261
Let me call you back.
I got something here.

144
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,875
Don't say anything
until we finish our conversation.

145
00:19:29,051 --> 00:19:30,848
You were at lunch three hours.

146
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:34,920
About that.

147
00:19:39,962 --> 00:19:43,898
Where's my friend? Where is my friend?

148
00:19:47,903 --> 00:19:49,131
Mr. Waturi.

149
00:19:49,805 --> 00:19:51,796
Mr. Waturi.

150
00:19:56,578 --> 00:19:57,806
Hello?

151
00:20:02,417 --> 00:20:04,476
This is company property.

152
00:20:05,487 --> 00:20:07,318
Don't touch that!

153
00:20:07,823 --> 00:20:11,088
- What are you doing?
- I'm opening or closing the main drain.

154
00:20:11,326 --> 00:20:13,055
You shouldn't be touching that.

155
00:20:14,496 --> 00:20:15,929
Nothing happened.

156
00:20:16,932 --> 00:20:20,060
Do you know how long I wondered
what would happen if I did that?

157
00:20:21,103 --> 00:20:24,163
- What's wrong with you?
- Brain cloud.

158
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,775
Never mind. Listen, Mr. Waturi.

159
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,440
I quit.

160
00:20:34,516 --> 00:20:36,780
- Today?
- That's right.

161
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:41,351
That's great. Don't come looking
for a reference from me.

162
00:20:41,423 --> 00:20:43,414
Okay, I won't.

163
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:45,351
<i>Robinson Crusoe.</i>

164
00:20:45,694 --> 00:20:47,127
You blew this job.

165
00:20:47,462 --> 00:20:49,692
<i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>

166
00:20:51,033 --> 00:20:52,295
<i>The Odyssey.</i>

167
00:20:52,534 --> 00:20:54,695
You blew this job.

168
00:20:55,537 --> 00:20:56,868
Ukulele.

169
00:20:57,472 --> 00:21:00,305
I worked here four and a half years.

170
00:21:00,642 --> 00:21:04,373
The work I did
I probably could have done in six months.

171
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,814
That leaves four years left over.

172
00:21:08,116 --> 00:21:09,310
Four years.

173
00:21:10,485 --> 00:21:12,282
<i>If I had them now...</i>

174
00:21:13,622 --> 00:21:15,180
Like gold in my hand.

175
00:21:16,425 --> 00:21:17,392
Here.

176
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,750
For you.

177
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,560
Good-bye, DeDe.

178
00:21:22,097 --> 00:21:23,530
You're going?

179
00:21:23,765 --> 00:21:25,494
If you're leaving, leave.

180
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:30,368
You'll get your check. And I promise you,
you'll be easy to replace.

181
00:21:33,775 --> 00:21:36,266
- I should say something.
- What are you muttering?

182
00:21:38,947 --> 00:21:41,643
<i>This life... Life, what a joke.</i>

183
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:44,311
<i>This situation, this room...</i>

184
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,445
You should just go.

185
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,713
You look terrible, Mr. Waturi.

186
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,586
You look like a bag of shit
stuffed in a cheap suit.

187
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:54,720
But no one could look good
under these zombie lights.

188
00:21:54,796 --> 00:21:58,630
I can feel them sucking the juice
out of my eyeballs.

189
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,531
Suck! Suck!

190
00:22:03,005 --> 00:22:04,336
$300 a week.

191
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:08,907
For $300 a week I've lived in this sink.
This used rubber.

192
00:22:09,144 --> 00:22:13,240
- Watch it. There's a woman here!
- Don't you think I know that?

193
00:22:13,448 --> 00:22:16,315
Don't you think I'm aware
there's a woman here?

194
00:22:16,485 --> 00:22:20,478
I can smell her like a flower.
I can taste her like sugar on my tongue.

195
00:22:20,622 --> 00:22:24,820
I'm 20 feet away, I can hear the fabric
of her dress when she moves.

196
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:29,488
But I haven't done anything about it.

197
00:22:30,065 --> 00:22:32,556
I go every day not doing, not saying...

198
00:22:32,734 --> 00:22:36,033
...not taking the chance for $300 a week.

199
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:41,235
And, Frank, the coffee, it stinks.

200
00:22:41,676 --> 00:22:43,007
It tastes like arsenic.

201
00:22:43,078 --> 00:22:46,241
If the lights don't give you a headache,
you must be dead!

202
00:22:46,314 --> 00:22:47,781
So, let's arrange the funeral.

203
00:22:47,849 --> 00:22:49,840
You better go. I'm telling you!

204
00:22:50,185 --> 00:22:52,380
- You're telling me nothing.
- I'm telling you!

205
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:56,788
Why, I ask myself, have I put up with you?
I can't imagine.

206
00:22:57,259 --> 00:23:00,353
But I know. It's fear.
Yellow, freaking fear.

207
00:23:00,429 --> 00:23:04,388
I've been too afraid to live my life,
so I sold it to you...

208
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,625
...for $300 dollars a week!

209
00:23:08,036 --> 00:23:12,473
You're lucky I don't kill you!
You're lucky I don't rip your throat out!

210
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,867
But I'm not going to!

211
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:17,644
Maybe you're not so lucky...

212
00:23:17,879 --> 00:23:21,144
...because I'm going to leave you here,
Mr. Wahoo Waturi.

213
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,141
What could be worse than that?

214
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:32,786
- DeDe.
- Yeah.

215
00:23:33,562 --> 00:23:36,258
- How about dinner tonight?
- Okay.

216
00:23:43,405 --> 00:23:46,067
Wow! What a change.

217
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:52,010
Who am I? That's the real question.
Who am I? Who are you?

218
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:55,339
What other questions are there, really?

219
00:23:55,584 --> 00:24:00,419
If you want to understand the universe,
embrace it, the door is you.

220
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:04,189
- Me?
- You. Me.

221
00:24:04,593 --> 00:24:07,585
- You are really intense.
- Am I?

222
00:24:07,929 --> 00:24:11,262
Yeah, I guess I am. I was.

223
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:15,200
- What do you mean?
- I mean, a long time ago.

224
00:24:15,437 --> 00:24:19,601
In the beginning I was full
of piss and vinegar. Nothing got me down.

225
00:24:20,008 --> 00:24:21,407
I wanted to know.

226
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,871
Know what?

227
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:27,214
Everything!
But then I had some experiences.

228
00:24:27,449 --> 00:24:30,213
I talked to this guy
and he says I got scared.

229
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:31,780
Of what?

230
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:34,783
Have you ever been scared?

231
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:38,616
I guess so. Sure.

232
00:24:39,794 --> 00:24:41,352
What scared you?

233
00:24:41,796 --> 00:24:44,731
Lots of things.
At the moment, you scare me a little.

234
00:24:44,966 --> 00:24:47,560
Me? Why should I scare you?

235
00:24:47,702 --> 00:24:48,930
I don't know.

236
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:53,071
There's something going on with you.

237
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,903
This morning you were like a lump.

238
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:57,908
<i>And now you're...</i>

239
00:24:59,314 --> 00:25:00,679
How do you feel?

240
00:25:01,316 --> 00:25:02,647
I feel great.

241
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:05,409
See? You never feel great.

242
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:08,086
No, I never do!

243
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:11,987
What's funny?

244
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,822
I feel great! That is very funny!

245
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:17,493
Where are you?

246
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,332
I'm right here!

247
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:22,767
I wish I was where you are.

248
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:25,333
No, you don't.

249
00:25:27,175 --> 00:25:30,110
Did I ever tell you
that the first time I saw you...

250
00:25:30,512 --> 00:25:32,844
...I felt I had seen you before?

251
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:42,517
Wait a minute.

252
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:55,697
What'd you do?

253
00:25:55,870 --> 00:26:00,705
I bribed them to sing a song to drive us
insane and make our hearts burst.

254
00:27:51,653 --> 00:27:53,484
What happened to you?

255
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:58,586
What happened to you that you're so alive?
I can see it.

256
00:27:58,993 --> 00:28:01,325
There's something wrong with my brain.

257
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:05,498
It's not catching,
but I have just five or six months to live.

258
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:11,769
- What?
- I'm going to die.

259
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:15,273
And I'm just so appreciative of my life.

260
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:28,081
- I got to go.
- Please, don't.

261
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:33,621
I got to go home. You may have quit,
but I have the job in the morning.

262
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,862
I really want you to stay.

263
00:28:36,364 --> 00:28:38,696
- You're going to die?
- But so what?

264
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:42,130
Stay tonight.
Tomorrow will take care of itself.

265
00:28:58,052 --> 00:29:00,111
I can't handle it, Joe.

266
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,316
Sorry.

267
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:17,167
I forgot my bag.

268
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:14,221
Joe Banks? Mr. Joe Banks?

269
00:30:17,265 --> 00:30:18,960
Have I come at a bad time?

270
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,963
Yes. No.

271
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:25,164
- I don't know how to answer that question.
- Can I come in to talk?

272
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,379
You're not dressed.

273
00:30:33,815 --> 00:30:36,306
Doesn't bother me if it doesn't bother you.

274
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:40,145
Not a nice place you have, Joe.

275
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:42,716
Mind if I call you Joe?

276
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:44,657
Dingy.

277
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:48,589
Dismal. Shabby. Dinky.

278
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,189
Not much.

279
00:30:50,565 --> 00:30:53,796
It's a sign of tremendous sophistication...

280
00:30:53,868 --> 00:30:55,927
...that you haven't demanded my name...

281
00:30:56,004 --> 00:30:58,165
...or asked me what I'm doing here.

282
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:02,503
My name is Samuel Harvey Graynamore.

283
00:31:03,311 --> 00:31:05,575
- Joe Banks.
- Oh, I know.

284
00:31:06,681 --> 00:31:09,013
Trying to see the hero in there.

285
00:31:10,685 --> 00:31:11,617
What?

286
00:31:11,719 --> 00:31:14,688
You dragged two kids down
a six-story burning staircase.

287
00:31:14,756 --> 00:31:15,916
That was brave.

288
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:21,459
Then you went back for the third kid.
That was heroic. You're a hero!

289
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:24,693
That was a long time ago.

290
00:31:25,033 --> 00:31:28,366
- Yes, it was.
- How do you know my name?

291
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:31,935
I know all about you.
All I could learn in 24 hours, anyway.

292
00:31:32,106 --> 00:31:33,095
Peanuts?

293
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:36,736
- Quit your job?
- Yeah.

294
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:39,211
Sounded like a dumb job. No family?

295
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:42,980
Good for you.
Families are a pain in the neck.

296
00:31:45,053 --> 00:31:48,147
What do you know about superconductors?

297
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,818
- Nothing.
- Me, neither.

298
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:54,826
I own a company that dominates
the world market for superconductors.

299
00:31:55,229 --> 00:31:56,389
Really?

300
00:31:57,398 --> 00:31:58,729
Sit down.

301
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,461
Dr. Ellison...

302
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:03,766
...you were at his office yesterday?

303
00:32:04,639 --> 00:32:06,004
Yes.

304
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:07,899
He told me your news.

305
00:32:08,576 --> 00:32:12,376
He thought that you and I
might be able to help each other.

306
00:32:14,082 --> 00:32:15,447
Got any whiskey?

307
00:32:15,917 --> 00:32:17,077
Nope.

308
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,344
I want to hire you, Joe Banks.

309
00:32:22,256 --> 00:32:26,317
I want to hire you to jump into a volcano.

310
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:33,026
You know...

311
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,764
...I do have some whiskey.

312
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:47,047
There's an island in the South Pacific
called Waponi Woo.

313
00:32:47,281 --> 00:32:50,614
The name means:
"The little island with the big volcano. "

314
00:32:50,952 --> 00:32:55,787
The Waponis are a cheerful people
who live simply fishing and picking fruit.

315
00:32:56,124 --> 00:33:00,618
Their one fear is that big volcano.
They call it the Big Woo.

316
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:02,188
They believe...

317
00:33:02,263 --> 00:33:06,359
...that an angry fire god in the volcano
will sink the island...

318
00:33:06,668 --> 00:33:09,501
...unless once every 100 years
he is appeased.

319
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:12,903
It's been 99 years,
11 months, and 11 days...

320
00:33:12,974 --> 00:33:17,308
...since the fire god got his propers,
and the Waponis are scared.

321
00:33:17,478 --> 00:33:19,412
How is the god appeased?

322
00:33:19,781 --> 00:33:23,774
Of his own free will,
a man has to jump into the volcano.

323
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:29,053
None of the Waponis are anxious
for the honor of jumping into the Big Woo.

324
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:33,022
- So, what do you do?
- What?

325
00:33:33,327 --> 00:33:35,488
You do some trading.

326
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:41,758
There's a mineral on that island,
Mr. Banks, called bubureau.

327
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:45,630
There isn't anywhere else
you can find more than a gram.

328
00:33:45,707 --> 00:33:46,765
I've looked.

329
00:33:46,841 --> 00:33:50,504
Because without bubureau,
I can't make superconductors.

330
00:33:50,578 --> 00:33:53,172
I tried to get mineral rights
from the Waponis but...

331
00:33:53,247 --> 00:33:55,477
...I have nothing they want.

332
00:33:57,018 --> 00:33:59,782
But they do want a hero, Mr. Banks.

333
00:34:00,722 --> 00:34:04,089
They'll give me the mineral rights
if I find them one.

334
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,957
Why would I jump into a volcano?

335
00:34:07,028 --> 00:34:10,759
From your actions in the fire department,
I think you have the courage.

336
00:34:10,832 --> 00:34:11,890
You do?

337
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:15,561
Is it more gutsy to twice traverse
a staircase in flames...

338
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:18,799
...or to make a one-time leap
into the mouth of a smoking volcano?

339
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,369
<i>Damned if I know, kimosabe.</i>

340
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:26,477
I know when you make those kinds of calls,
you're up in high country.

341
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:32,980
From your doctor, you're on your way out.

342
00:34:33,221 --> 00:34:35,314
You have no money. I checked.

343
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,891
Want to wait it out in this apartment?

344
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:43,654
That sounds grim to me.
Not the way I'd want to go, I'll tell you.

345
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:47,093
These are yours if you take the job.

346
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:51,695
It's 20 days from today
before you'd have to jump into the volcano.

347
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:56,666
You could shop today.
Get yourself clothes for an adventure.

348
00:34:56,844 --> 00:35:00,678
Then tomorrow, a plane to L.A.
First class, naturally.

349
00:35:00,915 --> 00:35:03,008
You'll stay at the best hotel.

350
00:35:03,251 --> 00:35:08,086
The next day you board a yacht.
My competitors often watch the airports.

351
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:11,348
My yacht's a beauty. Gourmet chef.

352
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:14,126
Sail to the South Pacific in 15 days.

353
00:35:14,262 --> 00:35:18,255
Waponis come out to meet you.
A total red-carpet situation.

354
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,831
You're a hero, like Charles Lindbergh.

355
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:25,096
Wine, women, and song
in the sweetest paradise you ever saw.

356
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,340
Then...

357
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:29,703
...you jump into the volcano.

358
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:33,108
Live like a king, die like a man, I say.

359
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,712
What do you say?

360
00:35:41,189 --> 00:35:42,315
I'll do it.

361
00:35:43,624 --> 00:35:44,955
Here's my card.

362
00:35:45,026 --> 00:35:48,291
And your plane ticket, American.
Noon out of Kennedy tomorrow.

363
00:35:49,497 --> 00:35:53,763
<i>I have an American Express gold card.
Can I rent a limousine for the day?</i>

364
00:35:54,502 --> 00:35:56,732
<i>Great. Does the driver come with that?</i>

365
00:35:56,804 --> 00:35:59,204
<i>Great. Do you rent anything else?</i>

366
00:35:59,874 --> 00:36:01,671
<i>No, okay, that's it.</i>

367
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:16,954
So, where would you like to go?

368
00:36:18,492 --> 00:36:19,652
Excuse me?

369
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:23,924
- Where would you like to go, sir?
- I'd like to do some shopping.

370
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:26,597
Where would you like to go shopping?

371
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:29,099
I don't know.

372
00:36:30,171 --> 00:36:31,263
All right.

373
00:36:32,006 --> 00:36:34,770
- Where would you go shopping?
- What do you need?

374
00:36:35,009 --> 00:36:38,342
- Clothes.
- What kind? What's your taste?

375
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:41,278
I don't exactly know.

376
00:36:44,018 --> 00:36:45,849
Why are you stopping?

377
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:50,785
You hired me to drive the car,
not to tell you who you are.

378
00:36:51,025 --> 00:36:52,686
I didn't ask you that.

379
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:57,795
You're hinting around about clothes.
That's an important topic to me, Mr...?

380
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:01,458
- Banks.
- Clothes make the man. I believe that.

381
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:05,238
You say you want to buy clothes,
but you don't know what kind.

382
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:08,241
You leave it hanging in the air
like I'll fill in the blanks.

383
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:11,472
That's like asking me who you are,
and I don't know who you are.

384
00:37:11,545 --> 00:37:13,069
I don't want to know.

385
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:17,914
It's taken me all my life to find out
who I am, and I am tired now.

386
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:19,509
Hear what I'm saying?

387
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:23,282
- What's your name?
- Joe.

388
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:26,319
Mine is Marshall. How do you do?

389
00:37:27,061 --> 00:37:29,996
Wait a minute. I'm coming back.

390
00:37:40,107 --> 00:37:43,508
Now, what's your situation?
Explain it to me.

391
00:37:43,577 --> 00:37:45,670
I'm going on a long trip.

392
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:49,713
And I have the opportunity
to buy some clothes today.

393
00:37:50,785 --> 00:37:54,448
- Money is no object.
- Good. Where are you going?

394
00:37:54,789 --> 00:37:57,724
Tonight I'm going out in the city.

395
00:37:58,059 --> 00:37:59,720
- Nice places?
- I hope so.

396
00:37:59,961 --> 00:38:02,555
- Tomorrow I fly to L.A.
- First class?

397
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:03,686
Yeah.

398
00:38:03,965 --> 00:38:06,229
Then I'm sailing to the South Pacific.

399
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:09,463
- Hawaii?
- No, an unknown little island.

400
00:38:09,804 --> 00:38:11,465
- No tourists?
- I don't think so.

401
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:12,198
Good.

402
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:15,937
I'll stay on the island for a few weeks,
and that's it.

403
00:38:16,344 --> 00:38:18,642
What kind of clothes do you have now?

404
00:38:18,746 --> 00:38:20,714
The kind of clothes I'm wearing.

405
00:38:20,781 --> 00:38:22,373
So, you got no clothes.

406
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:43,468
- Hey, Joe, how about a tux?
- I'll get one, if you get one?

407
00:38:44,005 --> 00:38:47,441
I can't be buying no Armani tux.
I'm a workingman.

408
00:38:47,508 --> 00:38:50,909
No one is paying you
to give me all this advice.

409
00:38:50,978 --> 00:38:53,606
Let me buy you the tux
and we'll call it even.

410
00:38:56,017 --> 00:38:59,680
- I feel like I'm getting married.
- I feel like I'm giving you away.

411
00:39:12,967 --> 00:39:15,800
All right. I'll take nine pairs.

412
00:39:34,655 --> 00:39:37,488
Give me Cassie Cimorelli, please.

413
00:39:39,093 --> 00:39:42,256
<i>Hello, Cassie. It's Marshall. How do?</i>

414
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:46,325
<i>Good.
I got somebody that needs you today.</i>

415
00:39:46,567 --> 00:39:50,230
You look like a prince in a fairy tale.

416
00:39:50,771 --> 00:39:52,568
You're coming into focus, kid.

417
00:40:10,091 --> 00:40:11,422
I'll take it.

418
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:16,694
Swiss army knife, world-band travel radio,
shaving kit...

419
00:40:16,931 --> 00:40:20,423
...two Coleman lanterns,
and a violin case bar.

420
00:40:20,701 --> 00:40:22,532
Will there be anything else?

421
00:40:24,038 --> 00:40:25,266
I'll take this.

422
00:40:29,944 --> 00:40:32,708
<i>Have you thought much about luggage?</i>

423
00:40:32,947 --> 00:40:34,608
<i>No, I never really have.</i>

424
00:40:34,882 --> 00:40:37,874
It's the central preoccupation of my life.

425
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:42,052
You travel the world,
you're away from home...

426
00:40:42,289 --> 00:40:44,223
...perhaps away from your family...

427
00:40:44,291 --> 00:40:48,728
...all you have to depend on is yourself,
and your luggage.

428
00:40:48,963 --> 00:40:50,624
I guess that's true.

429
00:40:51,065 --> 00:40:54,626
- Are you traveling light or heavy?
- Heavy.

430
00:40:54,969 --> 00:40:57,904
- Flying?
- Flying and by ship.

431
00:40:58,305 --> 00:41:00,170
- An ocean voyage.
- Yes.

432
00:41:07,982 --> 00:41:10,075
A real journey.

433
00:41:10,484 --> 00:41:12,213
Then I'll be on an island.

434
00:41:12,419 --> 00:41:16,082
I don't know if I'll be living
in a hut or what.

435
00:41:16,991 --> 00:41:18,754
Very exciting...

436
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:25,295
...as a luggage problem.

437
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:29,566
I have just the thing.

438
00:42:00,067 --> 00:42:02,661
This is our premier steamer trunk.

439
00:42:03,003 --> 00:42:05,995
All handmade, only the finest materials.

440
00:42:06,407 --> 00:42:09,570
It's even watertight. Tight as a drum.

441
00:42:10,844 --> 00:42:14,007
If I had the need and the wherewithal,
Mr. Banks...

442
00:42:14,515 --> 00:42:16,710
...this would be my trunk of choice.

443
00:42:17,384 --> 00:42:18,612
I'll take four.

444
00:42:18,852 --> 00:42:22,015
May you live to be
a thousand years old, sir.

445
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:24,557
Same to you.

446
00:42:24,925 --> 00:42:28,053
<i>- Where to? Back to Staten Island?
- No.</i>

447
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:31,761
<i>A really nice hotel.</i>

448
00:42:32,433 --> 00:42:34,025
The Plaza.

449
00:42:34,768 --> 00:42:36,258
The Plaza is nice.

450
00:42:37,438 --> 00:42:38,871
Where would you go?

451
00:42:39,206 --> 00:42:42,175
- The Pierre.
- Then we're off to the Pierre.

452
00:42:44,445 --> 00:42:47,778
Marshall, would you like to have dinner
with me tonight?

453
00:42:48,115 --> 00:42:51,573
I can't. I have the wife and kids
at the end of the day.

454
00:42:54,221 --> 00:42:56,689
Everything is at check-in
when you're ready, sir.

455
00:42:59,293 --> 00:43:00,282
Listen.

456
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:06,393
- Haven't you got anybody?
- No, but...

457
00:43:07,735 --> 00:43:11,637
...there are certain times when
you're not supposed to have anyone.

458
00:43:11,905 --> 00:43:14,305
Certain doors you must go through alone.

459
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:17,968
You'll be all right.

460
00:44:45,733 --> 00:44:49,692
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we're descending into Los Angeles.</i>

461
00:44:51,739 --> 00:44:54,173
That was totally awesome.

462
00:45:04,852 --> 00:45:08,811
- Hi. Are you Joe Banks?
- Yeah. Who are you?

463
00:45:09,256 --> 00:45:13,215
I'm the daughter of the guy who hired you.
Angelica Graynamore.

464
00:45:13,761 --> 00:45:16,628
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

465
00:45:17,431 --> 00:45:21,299
Daddy told me to say I don't know
why he hired you, and not to tell me.

466
00:45:21,368 --> 00:45:25,304
I'm totally untrustworthy.
I'm a flibbertigibbet.

467
00:45:25,539 --> 00:45:28,007
Come on, let's get out of here.

468
00:45:28,175 --> 00:45:29,699
I have some luggage.

469
00:45:30,611 --> 00:45:32,044
Then, follow me.

470
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:41,284
- I've never been to L.A. before.
- You're kidding. What do you think?

471
00:45:42,022 --> 00:45:44,855
It looks big. I like it.

472
00:45:48,362 --> 00:45:50,023
This is a great town.

473
00:45:50,364 --> 00:45:53,527
It stinks, but it's a great town.

474
00:46:05,112 --> 00:46:07,080
Sea scallops with three caviars.

475
00:46:07,881 --> 00:46:09,872
The Dungeness crabs.

476
00:46:13,954 --> 00:46:16,514
- Pepper?
- No.

477
00:46:21,562 --> 00:46:22,961
What's the matter?

478
00:46:23,297 --> 00:46:24,389
Nothing.

479
00:46:24,731 --> 00:46:27,700
They do look like little monsters.

480
00:46:28,635 --> 00:46:30,796
But they're good, little monsters.

481
00:46:34,308 --> 00:46:37,300
What did you do
before you signed on with Daddy?

482
00:46:38,479 --> 00:46:41,971
I was an advertising librarian
for a medical supply company.

483
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:45,718
I have no response to that.

484
00:46:46,987 --> 00:46:48,352
What do you do?

485
00:46:48,422 --> 00:46:49,855
What do I do?

486
00:46:51,258 --> 00:46:52,316
Why?

487
00:46:52,426 --> 00:46:54,394
Well, I don't know.

488
00:46:55,996 --> 00:46:57,987
I'm a painter and a poet.

489
00:46:59,766 --> 00:47:01,734
- Really?
- Yes.

490
00:47:03,103 --> 00:47:05,435
There's a painting of mine right there.

491
00:47:08,509 --> 00:47:09,942
That's terrific.

492
00:47:10,677 --> 00:47:12,372
Where do you get your ideas?

493
00:47:12,446 --> 00:47:15,108
You have to understand something
about art.

494
00:47:15,682 --> 00:47:18,150
It comes from some place.

495
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,454
Nice view.

496
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:24,847
It's like looking down on the stars.

497
00:47:35,636 --> 00:47:38,127
Would you like to hear one of my poems?

498
00:47:40,974 --> 00:47:45,138
"Long ago, the delicate tangles of his hair

499
00:47:46,713 --> 00:47:49,341
"covered the emptiness of my hands"

500
00:47:55,489 --> 00:47:58,049
- Want to hear it again?
- Okay.

501
00:48:01,495 --> 00:48:02,985
"Long ago

502
00:48:03,997 --> 00:48:06,989
"the delicate tangles of his hair

503
00:48:08,235 --> 00:48:11,068
"covered the emptiness of my hands"

504
00:48:17,544 --> 00:48:18,943
What's wrong?

505
00:48:19,012 --> 00:48:21,503
You ever think about killing yourself?.

506
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:25,215
What?

507
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:27,711
Why would you do that?

508
00:48:28,422 --> 00:48:29,855
Why shouldn't I?

509
00:48:31,258 --> 00:48:33,852
Some things take care of themselves.

510
00:48:33,927 --> 00:48:36,760
They're not your job.
Maybe not even your business.

511
00:48:41,535 --> 00:48:43,435
I like your poem.

512
00:48:45,038 --> 00:48:49,031
I'm a grown woman
and I live on my father's money.

513
00:48:50,043 --> 00:48:54,446
The restaurant that had my painting up
is my father's restaurant.

514
00:48:55,449 --> 00:48:57,041
Listen to me.

515
00:48:57,384 --> 00:49:01,047
If you have a choice
between killing yourself, and...

516
00:49:01,622 --> 00:49:04,216
...doing something you're scared of doing...

517
00:49:04,558 --> 00:49:07,721
...why not do the thing
you're scared of doing?

518
00:49:09,062 --> 00:49:12,554
You mean stop taking money
and leave L.A.?

519
00:49:12,899 --> 00:49:15,561
See? You know
what you're scared of doing.

520
00:49:15,669 --> 00:49:18,934
Why don't you do it? See what happens?

521
00:49:21,908 --> 00:49:23,466
You must be tired.

522
00:49:23,744 --> 00:49:25,268
I don't mind talking.

523
00:49:25,746 --> 00:49:27,111
I do.

524
00:49:27,414 --> 00:49:30,611
This is one of those conversations
where we're open...

525
00:49:30,684 --> 00:49:33,175
...and sharing our thoughts
and it's all bullshit...

526
00:49:33,253 --> 00:49:36,347
...and a lie,
and it doesn't cost you anything!

527
00:49:39,159 --> 00:49:41,491
Look, I don't know you.

528
00:49:41,828 --> 00:49:44,160
I don't think I know anybody.

529
00:49:45,432 --> 00:49:48,094
I can see that you're angry.

530
00:49:52,439 --> 00:49:54,100
I'm very troubled.

531
00:49:55,842 --> 00:49:57,673
<i>I'm not ready to...</i>

532
00:50:02,616 --> 00:50:05,449
There's only so much time, and...

533
00:50:07,788 --> 00:50:11,656
...you want to use it well.
So, I'm here, talking to you.

534
00:50:12,859 --> 00:50:14,884
I don't want to throw that away.

535
00:50:18,365 --> 00:50:20,424
I have no response to that.

536
00:50:23,870 --> 00:50:27,033
Maybe you should take me
back to the hotel.

537
00:50:42,322 --> 00:50:44,813
Want me to come up with you?

538
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:47,825
No.

539
00:50:47,894 --> 00:50:49,122
All right.

540
00:50:49,563 --> 00:50:51,554
Will you meet me for breakfast?

541
00:50:52,332 --> 00:50:55,859
You have to be at the boat by 10:00,
but we can meet for breakfast.

542
00:50:56,870 --> 00:50:58,098
Okay.

543
00:50:58,905 --> 00:51:01,237
I told you I was a flibbertigibbet.

544
00:52:05,972 --> 00:52:07,371
What do you think?

545
00:52:09,309 --> 00:52:10,640
It's terrific.

546
00:52:11,077 --> 00:52:13,910
I'm sorry I was so grotesque last night.

547
00:52:14,247 --> 00:52:15,646
You were fine.

548
00:52:15,916 --> 00:52:17,440
I disappointed you.

549
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:21,981
What did Daddy hire you to do?

550
00:52:23,657 --> 00:52:25,147
It's complicated.

551
00:52:25,425 --> 00:52:27,256
Okay, don't tell me.

552
00:52:27,727 --> 00:52:29,024
Thank you.

553
00:52:29,429 --> 00:52:31,989
- I bet Patricia knows.
- Who's Patricia?

554
00:52:32,199 --> 00:52:35,657
My half sister.
She's sailing you wherever you're going.

555
00:52:36,002 --> 00:52:37,230
She is?

556
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:38,860
You didn't know?

557
00:52:40,841 --> 00:52:44,607
Daddy loves a secret almost as much
as he loves money.

558
00:52:48,281 --> 00:52:50,010
Can I ask you something?

559
00:52:51,952 --> 00:52:54,147
Why are you dressed like Jungle Jim?

560
00:52:55,188 --> 00:52:56,678
I could change.

561
00:52:57,023 --> 00:52:59,958
Do you think this is inappropriate
for the boat?

562
00:53:03,296 --> 00:53:05,287
No, it's fine.

563
00:53:07,467 --> 00:53:08,991
We better go.

564
00:53:09,536 --> 00:53:11,902
I have a guy taking your trunks
to the marina...

565
00:53:11,972 --> 00:53:15,032
...who may or may not have understood
my directions.

566
00:53:15,976 --> 00:53:17,307
Come on.

567
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:19,707
<i>Ándale, ándale.</i>

568
00:53:22,816 --> 00:53:24,750
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

569
00:53:26,553 --> 00:53:28,487
What's the trunks, Felix?

570
00:53:28,755 --> 00:53:30,382
<i>Those are...</i>

571
00:53:30,557 --> 00:53:32,616
My name's not Felix, it's Joe.

572
00:53:32,893 --> 00:53:34,155
I know.

573
00:53:38,732 --> 00:53:40,996
- That's your half sister?
- Yeah.

574
00:53:41,735 --> 00:53:43,828
That outfit is wearing you, Felix.

575
00:53:44,571 --> 00:53:46,835
Why are you calling me Felix?
My name is Joe.

576
00:53:46,907 --> 00:53:49,740
I'm calling you Felix
because I do what I want.

577
00:53:50,076 --> 00:53:51,373
Hello, Angelica.

578
00:53:51,444 --> 00:53:54,345
Hello, Patricia.
Do you know where Daddy is?

579
00:53:55,749 --> 00:53:59,378
We never know where our father is
and always suspect the other one knows.

580
00:53:59,452 --> 00:54:02,512
But it's all phone calls and telegrams,
eh, Angelica?

581
00:54:03,089 --> 00:54:05,557
Well, you're in a rotten mood.

582
00:54:06,192 --> 00:54:08,592
The sunshine gets me down.

583
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:10,694
Where are you going?

584
00:54:10,764 --> 00:54:15,599
Dad says not to tell you. Goes with
my theory. Power makes you paranoid.

585
00:54:17,103 --> 00:54:20,038
Well, get ready to heave, Felix.

586
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:24,032
My name is Joseph or Joe.

587
00:54:24,878 --> 00:54:28,370
All right, Joe. Get ready. We're leaving.

588
00:54:29,716 --> 00:54:31,775
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

589
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:35,053
You're shaking.

590
00:54:35,455 --> 00:54:36,854
I am?

591
00:55:49,896 --> 00:55:51,261
Here you go.

592
00:55:52,332 --> 00:55:54,095
That looks delicious.

593
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:56,699
<i>We eat well aboard the Tweedle Dee.</i>

594
00:55:57,037 --> 00:55:59,767
<i>- The Tweedle Dee?
- That's the name of the boat.</i>

595
00:56:01,041 --> 00:56:04,533
So, we're going to the island
of Waponi Woo.

596
00:56:05,145 --> 00:56:06,976
- I guess so.
- Why?

597
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:09,038
- You don't know?
- No.

598
00:56:10,483 --> 00:56:12,348
- Have you been there?
- No.

599
00:56:13,053 --> 00:56:17,046
All I know is the name means
"Little island with the big volcano"...

600
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:20,456
...and the people, the Waponis,
like orange soda.

601
00:56:21,394 --> 00:56:23,157
They like orange soda?

602
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:28,028
"1,800 years ago a Roman galley
with a crew of Jews and Druids...

603
00:56:28,101 --> 00:56:30,501
"... got caught in a storm off Carthage.

604
00:56:31,004 --> 00:56:33,165
"They were swept 1,000 miles off course...

605
00:56:33,239 --> 00:56:36,003
"... and ended up
on the wrong side of Africa.

606
00:56:36,576 --> 00:56:39,739
"Trying to return to Rome,
they sailed into the South Pacific...

607
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:43,408
"... and colonized a lightly populated
Polynesian island...

608
00:56:43,917 --> 00:56:46,010
"... which they named Waponi Woo.

609
00:56:46,119 --> 00:56:47,848
"Thus was born the Waponi culture...

610
00:56:47,921 --> 00:56:51,357
"... a mix of Polynesian, Celtic, Hebrew,
and Latin influences.

611
00:56:52,358 --> 00:56:55,919
"The Waponi are known to have
a peculiar love of orange soda...

612
00:56:56,196 --> 00:56:58,187
"... and no sense of direction. "

613
00:56:59,365 --> 00:57:02,300
Why did you talk so snotty
back on the dock?

614
00:57:05,371 --> 00:57:09,034
Because you work for my father,
and I'm angry with my father.

615
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:11,704
Why are you angry with him?

616
00:57:11,778 --> 00:57:13,541
Because he's never around.

617
00:57:13,713 --> 00:57:16,204
If you're angry, why do you work for him?

618
00:57:16,382 --> 00:57:20,546
I don't work for him.
My transport of you is strictly a favor.

619
00:57:20,887 --> 00:57:22,946
You do favors for people you're mad at?

620
00:57:23,056 --> 00:57:24,546
I don't work for him.

621
00:57:27,794 --> 00:57:30,194
He's giving me this boat for taking you.

622
00:57:33,066 --> 00:57:34,727
He's got two of them.

623
00:57:35,135 --> 00:57:37,399
<i>There's a Tweedle Dum, too.</i>

624
00:57:37,637 --> 00:57:39,969
That makes everything okay, then.

625
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,164
Yes, it does.

626
00:57:51,317 --> 00:57:52,784
Is this okay?

627
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:54,279
Sure.

628
00:57:54,921 --> 00:57:58,857
The boys sleep in the hull.
Dagmar usually sleeps on deck.

629
00:57:59,192 --> 00:58:02,684
So you have things to yourself.
I'm in the little stateroom.

630
00:58:03,229 --> 00:58:04,560
Great.

631
00:58:09,335 --> 00:58:11,496
I'm sorry I was rude on the dock.

632
00:58:11,671 --> 00:58:13,002
It's okay.

633
00:58:15,441 --> 00:58:17,671
Did you sleep with my sister?

634
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:21,904
No.

635
00:58:22,081 --> 00:58:24,106
Actually, she's my half sister.

636
00:58:26,186 --> 00:58:27,710
No, I didn't.

637
00:58:29,355 --> 00:58:32,051
- You like to fish?
- Sure.

638
00:58:32,125 --> 00:58:34,491
Tomorrow we'll do some fishing.

639
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:40,365
This is the light switch.

640
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:42,628
Did Mike show you
how to work the bathroom?

641
00:58:42,702 --> 00:58:44,033
Yeah.

642
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:50,774
Do you want me to turn it off while I go?

643
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:52,543
Okay.

644
00:58:57,383 --> 00:59:00,181
I love my sister,
even though she's screwed up.

645
00:59:01,554 --> 00:59:04,614
I love my father,
even though I never see him...

646
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:07,358
...and he's not great when I do see him.

647
00:59:08,394 --> 00:59:09,861
I'm nervous about this trip.

648
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:13,490
Neither you nor my father
will tell me anything.

649
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:15,798
But it's more than that.

650
00:59:19,772 --> 00:59:23,003
I've always kept clear of my father's stuff
since I was on my own...

651
00:59:23,076 --> 00:59:25,067
...and he's pulled me back in.

652
00:59:25,578 --> 00:59:28,308
He used this boat
to get me to work for him...

653
00:59:28,414 --> 00:59:30,678
...which I swore I'd never do.

654
00:59:35,088 --> 00:59:36,919
I feel ashamed...

655
00:59:38,591 --> 00:59:40,491
...because I had a price.

656
00:59:41,761 --> 00:59:44,821
He named it,
and now I know that about myself.

657
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:51,161
I could treat you like I did on the dock,
but that would be...

658
00:59:52,438 --> 00:59:56,101
...me kicking myself for selling out,
which isn't fair to you.

659
00:59:57,510 --> 00:59:59,501
Doesn't make me feel any better.

660
01:00:02,615 --> 01:00:07,109
I don't know your situation,
but I wanted you to know mine.

661
01:00:07,353 --> 01:00:10,186
Not just to explain some rude behavior...

662
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:12,188
...but because...

663
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:16,454
...we're on a little boat for a while and...

664
01:00:17,297 --> 01:00:18,787
...I'm soul sick.

665
01:00:19,365 --> 01:00:21,026
You'll see that.

666
01:00:25,805 --> 01:00:29,502
Like my sister. She's soul sick, too.
If you'd slept with her...

667
01:00:30,376 --> 01:00:32,708
...I'd have known something about you.

668
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:36,204
But you didn't.

669
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:39,548
You didn't.

670
01:00:40,153 --> 01:00:41,814
And I believe you.

671
01:00:43,489 --> 01:00:45,184
I'm glad you believe me.

672
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:49,051
Have you slept on a boat before?

673
01:00:50,430 --> 01:00:51,397
No.

674
01:00:51,497 --> 01:00:53,727
It really effects your dreams.

675
01:00:54,334 --> 01:00:58,395
I look forward to it, though the dreams
sometimes shake me up.

676
01:01:01,007 --> 01:01:02,235
Okay.

677
01:01:03,176 --> 01:01:04,336
Good night.

678
01:03:07,133 --> 01:03:08,998
<i>I'm leaving you on this island?</i>

679
01:03:09,068 --> 01:03:11,093
- That's right.
- For how long?

680
01:03:11,704 --> 01:03:13,365
For the rest of my life.

681
01:03:14,474 --> 01:03:16,169
I can't imagine that.

682
01:03:16,309 --> 01:03:18,300
- Are you used to this?
- What?

683
01:03:19,378 --> 01:03:21,903
The ocean. The stars.

684
01:03:24,650 --> 01:03:26,550
You never get used to it.

685
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:30,815
That's why I want this boat.
All I want to do is sail away.

686
01:03:31,991 --> 01:03:33,583
Where would you go?

687
01:03:34,327 --> 01:03:36,887
Away from the things of man.

688
01:03:43,369 --> 01:03:44,927
Do you believe in God?

689
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:48,006
I believe in myself.

690
01:03:49,575 --> 01:03:50,906
What's that mean?

691
01:03:52,011 --> 01:03:54,241
I have confidence in myself.

692
01:03:56,015 --> 01:04:00,418
I've been doing some soul-searching lately.
Know what I found out?

693
01:04:03,689 --> 01:04:05,748
I have no interest in myself.

694
01:04:06,058 --> 01:04:09,118
I start thinking about myself,
I get bored out of my mind.

695
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:13,057
What does interest you?

696
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:15,128
I don't know.

697
01:04:15,368 --> 01:04:17,996
Courage. Courage interests me.

698
01:04:18,671 --> 01:04:22,801
So, you'll spend the rest of your life
on an island in the South Pacific?

699
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:27,110
Till now I've lived on a tiny island
called Staten Island.

700
01:04:28,381 --> 01:04:32,943
Commuted to this job in a shut-up room,
pumped-in air, no sunshine...

701
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:34,719
...despicable people.

702
01:04:34,787 --> 01:04:39,053
Now that I have some distance from
the situation, I find that unbelievable.

703
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:43,490
Your life seems unbelievable to me.

704
01:04:43,563 --> 01:04:46,031
But all of this life seems so...

705
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:49,294
...unbelievable to me.

706
01:04:51,637 --> 01:04:54,231
My father says the whole world is asleep.

707
01:04:54,340 --> 01:04:57,673
Everyone you know, everyone you see,
everyone you talk to.

708
01:04:58,144 --> 01:05:00,408
Only a few people are awake...

709
01:05:00,479 --> 01:05:04,973
...and they live in a state
of constant, total amazement.

710
01:05:13,492 --> 01:05:15,426
I have six months to live.

711
01:05:15,528 --> 01:05:19,464
The Waponis believe they need
a human sacrifice or the island will sink.

712
01:05:19,532 --> 01:05:23,093
Your father hired me
to jump into the volcano.

713
01:05:25,204 --> 01:05:26,171
What?

714
01:05:26,238 --> 01:05:28,604
You're not gonna make me say that again,
are you?

715
01:05:28,674 --> 01:05:29,800
No!

716
01:05:31,677 --> 01:05:32,644
Well?

717
01:05:33,846 --> 01:05:35,939
Aren't you going to say anything?

718
01:05:39,452 --> 01:05:41,079
I don't know what to say.

719
01:05:41,153 --> 01:05:45,385
You say you're dying, and going
to jump into a volcano. My mind is blank.

720
01:05:46,025 --> 01:05:47,686
I can understand that.

721
01:05:48,961 --> 01:05:50,292
Is it catching?

722
01:05:50,796 --> 01:05:52,354
No, no, no.

723
01:05:56,969 --> 01:05:59,529
Good night. I'll see you in the morning.

724
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:09,541
It's weird today, huh?

725
01:06:10,316 --> 01:06:12,147
There's a typhoon warning.

726
01:06:12,485 --> 01:06:15,215
- Good morning, Mr. Banks.
- Good morning, Dagmar.

727
01:06:15,821 --> 01:06:18,654
Looks like we're in for a blow.

728
01:06:33,506 --> 01:06:34,837
Can I help?

729
01:06:35,474 --> 01:06:37,135
Yeah, tie that up.

730
01:06:38,911 --> 01:06:40,674
Feels dead, doesn't it?

731
01:06:41,681 --> 01:06:43,342
Yeah, it does.

732
01:06:44,183 --> 01:06:45,207
Mike?

733
01:06:45,584 --> 01:06:50,419
Get below, start the engine.
Tell Tony to head us into the wind.

734
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:54,184
- There isn't any wind.
- There will be.

735
01:06:56,095 --> 01:06:57,426
You worried?

736
01:06:58,097 --> 01:07:02,591
We'll be okay. The hatches and sails
are down. We're ahead of the game.

737
01:07:06,105 --> 01:07:08,198
What exactly is a typhoon?

738
01:07:10,776 --> 01:07:12,209
You know...

739
01:07:12,712 --> 01:07:15,044
...I think you're going to find out.

740
01:07:40,339 --> 01:07:42,364
<i>Mayday! This is the Tweedle Dee.</i>

741
01:07:42,441 --> 01:07:44,306
Latitude: 10 degrees, 8 minutes south.

742
01:07:44,376 --> 01:07:47,937
Longitude: approximately 150 degrees,
18 minutes west.

743
01:07:48,013 --> 01:07:50,982
- We are in severe distress.
- What should I do?

744
01:07:51,584 --> 01:07:54,485
Don't go on deck.
The engines, check on Dagmar.

745
01:07:55,821 --> 01:07:57,186
Mayday!

746
01:07:58,257 --> 01:08:00,589
Dagmar, is everything okay?

747
01:08:00,693 --> 01:08:03,787
It looks good, but I'm going to stay with it.

748
01:08:04,430 --> 01:08:05,988
Take care of Patricia.

749
01:08:10,369 --> 01:08:14,032
150 degrees, 18 minutes west.
Severe distress!

750
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:16,399
No way is anyone getting this.

751
01:08:16,675 --> 01:08:18,472
- How's Dagmar?
- She's okay.

752
01:08:19,178 --> 01:08:21,305
The main boom doesn't look secure!

753
01:08:21,614 --> 01:08:24,014
It looks like it's going to bust loose!

754
01:08:27,386 --> 01:08:28,751
What are you doing!

755
01:08:29,188 --> 01:08:30,621
It's my boat!

756
01:09:13,566 --> 01:09:16,626
- Are you all right?
- I think so.

757
01:09:58,444 --> 01:09:59,775
Patricia!

758
01:10:02,047 --> 01:10:03,446
Patricia!

759
01:11:46,318 --> 01:11:47,478
Patricia?

760
01:15:44,056 --> 01:15:45,387
Giddy up.

761
01:18:28,153 --> 01:18:29,484
Dear God...

762
01:18:30,922 --> 01:18:33,083
...whose name I do not know...

763
01:18:35,093 --> 01:18:37,084
...thank you for my life.

764
01:18:40,165 --> 01:18:41,496
I forgot...

765
01:18:42,601 --> 01:18:44,091
<i>...how big...</i>

766
01:18:50,308 --> 01:18:51,673
Thank you.

767
01:18:53,779 --> 01:18:55,440
Thank you for my life.

768
01:19:16,968 --> 01:19:19,459
Didn't you drink any water yourself?.

769
01:19:22,541 --> 01:19:23,803
That's for you.

770
01:19:23,875 --> 01:19:25,672
What happened to the yacht?

771
01:19:26,545 --> 01:19:27,739
Lightning.

772
01:19:27,813 --> 01:19:30,077
Dagmar and the boys?

773
01:19:30,482 --> 01:19:32,040
Everything went down.

774
01:19:35,153 --> 01:19:37,280
I still have my trunks.

775
01:20:00,345 --> 01:20:01,812
What's that?

776
01:20:01,913 --> 01:20:03,505
We've been spotted.

777
01:20:03,582 --> 01:20:05,072
The Waponis?

778
01:20:06,151 --> 01:20:08,119
<i>Kimosabesl</i>

779
01:20:34,613 --> 01:20:37,013
Are you Joe?

780
01:20:40,619 --> 01:20:44,919
- Are you Joe Banks?
- Yeah.

781
01:21:44,449 --> 01:21:46,781
What is that? A teddy bear?

782
01:21:48,019 --> 01:21:51,250
No. It is my soul.

783
01:21:52,557 --> 01:21:54,115
I hope you don't lose it.

784
01:21:54,225 --> 01:21:55,556
So do I.

785
01:21:56,461 --> 01:21:58,895
I am Tobi. Chief.

786
01:21:59,598 --> 01:22:01,122
I'm Joe Banks.

787
01:22:01,866 --> 01:22:03,834
This is Patricia Graynamore.

788
01:22:05,136 --> 01:22:07,627
- You speak English.
- I have learned.

789
01:22:07,872 --> 01:22:10,534
You came to stop the anger of the Woo?

790
01:22:13,511 --> 01:22:14,637
Yeah.

791
01:22:14,713 --> 01:22:17,079
Tonight we will have a big feast.

792
01:22:17,315 --> 01:22:21,911
Then you will climb to the top
of the Big Woo and jump in, okay?

793
01:22:23,722 --> 01:22:24,916
Okay.

794
01:23:15,774 --> 01:23:17,139
Stop that!

795
01:23:40,699 --> 01:23:43,190
All right, that's it! That's it!

796
01:23:43,968 --> 01:23:45,401
We're done!

797
01:23:46,504 --> 01:23:48,233
Thank you. I feel great.

798
01:24:49,934 --> 01:24:51,959
Do you know where Joe is?

799
01:24:52,437 --> 01:24:53,870
Maybe he ran away.

800
01:24:53,938 --> 01:24:56,133
Maybe he don't want to jump.

801
01:25:29,407 --> 01:25:30,840
Like my tux?

802
01:25:30,909 --> 01:25:32,604
You're really going to do it?

803
01:25:32,677 --> 01:25:34,702
I might as well go out in style.

804
01:25:50,528 --> 01:25:53,190
We are the children of children...

805
01:25:53,264 --> 01:25:57,132
...and we live as we are shown.
Now, a change has come.

806
01:25:57,502 --> 01:26:02,371
The Waponis like this soda
and no one will jump into the Big Woo.

807
01:26:02,607 --> 01:26:05,667
They traded with this man,
your father, for a hero.

808
01:26:05,944 --> 01:26:07,775
We have no hero of our own.

809
01:26:08,012 --> 01:26:10,913
I am the Tobi. I cannot be the hero.

810
01:26:10,982 --> 01:26:13,246
It is my place to hope for my people.

811
01:26:13,318 --> 01:26:14,376
The Woo calls.

812
01:26:14,452 --> 01:26:18,684
None of my people say,
"I'll go to my end for all of you. "

813
01:26:19,390 --> 01:26:22,223
I don't have any people of my own, Chief.

814
01:26:23,127 --> 01:26:25,061
I'm my only hope for a hero.

815
01:26:25,396 --> 01:26:28,729
Once more,
I will call upon the Waponis for a hero.

816
01:26:49,921 --> 01:26:52,185
The Woo wants his flesh.

817
01:26:55,059 --> 01:26:57,789
Take me to...

818
01:26:58,263 --> 01:26:59,924
...the volcano!

819
01:28:05,496 --> 01:28:07,327
Is there a ceremony or anything?

820
01:28:07,398 --> 01:28:09,025
No, you just jump in.

821
01:28:12,070 --> 01:28:14,698
Wait! Stop! Wait.

822
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:17,505
Stop right there!

823
01:28:18,409 --> 01:28:19,842
I love you.

824
01:28:20,011 --> 01:28:22,002
I've fallen in love with you.

825
01:28:22,413 --> 01:28:24,711
I've never loved anybody.
How did this happen?

826
01:28:24,782 --> 01:28:26,977
I've never even slept with him.

827
01:28:27,652 --> 01:28:30,018
And now you're going to kill yourself.

828
01:28:30,855 --> 01:28:32,482
Can we have a minute?

829
01:28:36,527 --> 01:28:38,995
- You love me?
- Yes, I love you.

830
01:28:39,197 --> 01:28:41,290
I feel like I'm going crazy.

831
01:28:41,366 --> 01:28:45,029
You can't leave me on this stinking earth
without you.

832
01:28:45,103 --> 01:28:46,331
I must do it.

833
01:28:46,704 --> 01:28:51,073
Why? The Chief doesn't even want you to.
Do you, Chief?.

834
01:28:51,142 --> 01:28:54,305
I have wasted my entire life
and now I'm going to die.

835
01:28:54,412 --> 01:28:58,746
I have a chance to die like a man.
I have to take it!

836
01:28:59,050 --> 01:29:00,381
I love you.

837
01:29:00,485 --> 01:29:03,943
I love you, too!
I've never loved anyone before, either.

838
01:29:04,055 --> 01:29:08,048
It's great. I am glad.
But the timing stinks.

839
01:29:08,393 --> 01:29:09,724
I got to go.

840
01:29:15,566 --> 01:29:17,659
Get out of here.

841
01:29:17,735 --> 01:29:19,669
Let me do what I have to do.

842
01:29:19,804 --> 01:29:21,499
Marry me.

843
01:29:22,173 --> 01:29:23,765
What?

844
01:29:24,409 --> 01:29:27,071
Chief, could you come up here, please?

845
01:29:27,578 --> 01:29:29,842
- What are you doing?
- I want him to marry us.

846
01:29:29,914 --> 01:29:33,441
- I'm going to jump.
- So, marry me, then jump.

847
01:29:34,018 --> 01:29:36,646
- What?
- Marry us.

848
01:29:36,721 --> 01:29:37,688
Okay.

849
01:29:38,656 --> 01:29:40,487
I don't want to get married.

850
01:29:40,925 --> 01:29:42,893
Afraid of the commitment?

851
01:29:42,994 --> 01:29:46,828
You have to love and honor me
for 30 seconds. You can't handle that?

852
01:29:48,332 --> 01:29:49,993
All right. Marry us.

853
01:29:50,134 --> 01:29:52,329
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

854
01:29:52,603 --> 01:29:54,195
You want to marry her?

855
01:29:54,672 --> 01:29:55,639
Yes.

856
01:29:56,007 --> 01:29:58,168
- You want to marry him?
- Yes.

857
01:29:59,510 --> 01:30:00,807
You're married.

858
01:30:04,615 --> 01:30:06,105
Thank you, Chief.

859
01:30:06,851 --> 01:30:08,614
I'm going now.

860
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:10,851
Don't jump.

861
01:30:13,524 --> 01:30:16,288
Listen to me. These are my last words.

862
01:30:16,627 --> 01:30:18,959
I have to be brave. I have to jump.

863
01:30:19,063 --> 01:30:20,394
Good-bye.

864
01:30:33,211 --> 01:30:36,908
- Don't come out here.
- I have some last words, too.

865
01:30:38,382 --> 01:30:40,179
I can't think of anything to say.

866
01:30:40,251 --> 01:30:42,219
- I'm jumping with you.
- No, you're not.

867
01:30:42,286 --> 01:30:44,811
- "Whither thou goest, I go. "
- You didn't agree to this.

868
01:30:44,889 --> 01:30:46,754
- I do what I want.
- Don't do it for me.

869
01:30:46,824 --> 01:30:48,655
I'm not.

870
01:30:54,332 --> 01:30:56,994
Joe, nobody knows anything.

871
01:30:57,268 --> 01:31:01,204
We'll take this leap and we'll see.

872
01:31:01,506 --> 01:31:02,837
That's life.

873
01:31:04,909 --> 01:31:09,505
I saw the moon when we were out on
the ocean, shining down on everything.

874
01:31:10,181 --> 01:31:13,742
I've been miserable so long.
Years of my life, wasted.

875
01:31:15,686 --> 01:31:18,348
Been a long time coming here to meet you.

876
01:31:19,190 --> 01:31:22,023
A long time, on a crooked road.

877
01:31:25,096 --> 01:31:26,688
Did I ever tell you...

878
01:31:27,298 --> 01:31:29,232
...the first time I saw you...

879
01:31:30,168 --> 01:31:32,329
...I felt like I'd seen you before?

880
01:31:33,371 --> 01:31:35,805
You're not jumping without me.

881
01:31:44,715 --> 01:31:46,808
So, what are we hoping for here?

882
01:31:46,951 --> 01:31:48,282
A miracle.

883
01:31:49,687 --> 01:31:51,154
A miracle.

884
01:31:52,924 --> 01:31:54,289
I love you.

885
01:31:54,358 --> 01:31:55,757
You do?

886
01:31:56,360 --> 01:31:57,918
This is it.

887
01:32:00,598 --> 01:32:01,860
This is it.

888
01:32:04,035 --> 01:32:05,434
Give me your hand.

889
01:32:21,285 --> 01:32:22,752
I love you, too.

890
01:32:53,584 --> 01:32:54,915
Patricia?

891
01:33:07,331 --> 01:33:08,889
Why aren't you dead?

892
01:33:10,001 --> 01:33:11,298
Why aren't you dead?

893
01:33:11,369 --> 01:33:12,768
I don't know.

894
01:33:13,604 --> 01:33:17,438
- The volcano.
- We jumped in and it blew us out.

895
01:33:17,642 --> 01:33:19,109
That's impossible.

896
01:33:19,343 --> 01:33:21,675
I'd say, at least it's a miracle.

897
01:33:24,515 --> 01:33:26,449
There goes Waponi Woo.

898
01:33:28,286 --> 01:33:30,948
God. We really lucked out.

899
01:33:34,458 --> 01:33:35,982
<i>Yeah, but...</i>

900
01:33:36,127 --> 01:33:37,287
But what?

901
01:33:37,361 --> 01:33:40,956
I hate to mention it,
but we're in the middle of nowhere.

902
01:33:41,799 --> 01:33:43,562
We're going to drown.

903
01:33:43,634 --> 01:33:46,797
No, we're not. We're going to be all right.

904
01:33:49,540 --> 01:33:52,703
I don't know how,
but we're going to be all right.

905
01:34:07,391 --> 01:34:08,790
See?

906
01:34:09,660 --> 01:34:11,321
How did you do that?

907
01:34:26,677 --> 01:34:30,272
Isn't this romantic?
Who gets a honeymoon like this?

908
01:34:34,919 --> 01:34:37,080
<i>Yeah, but...</i>

909
01:34:38,055 --> 01:34:39,283
What's the matter?

910
01:34:39,357 --> 01:34:41,689
- I still have a problem.
- What?

911
01:34:43,561 --> 01:34:45,893
I have a brain cloud.

912
01:34:47,798 --> 01:34:49,527
A brain cloud.

913
01:34:51,035 --> 01:34:52,366
What is that?

914
01:34:53,204 --> 01:34:54,535
<i>Well, it's...</i>

915
01:34:55,139 --> 01:34:57,699
Maybe I should get a second opinion.

916
01:34:59,577 --> 01:35:03,069
You didn't get a second opinion
about something called a brain cloud?

917
01:35:03,381 --> 01:35:05,315
I just felt-

918
01:35:05,383 --> 01:35:07,544
What are you, a hypochondriac?

919
01:35:07,918 --> 01:35:10,079
I was. Not now.

920
01:35:10,154 --> 01:35:12,122
Nothing is wrong with you.

921
01:35:12,656 --> 01:35:14,317
Dr. Ellison said-

922
01:35:14,392 --> 01:35:16,724
<i>So some quack told you...</i>

923
01:35:17,561 --> 01:35:19,586
- Dr. Ellison?
- Yeah.

924
01:35:20,064 --> 01:35:21,793
That's my father's doctor.

925
01:35:21,899 --> 01:35:22,923
He is?

926
01:35:23,033 --> 01:35:27,163
Dr. Ellison doesn't have any other patients.
My father owns Dr. Ellison.

927
01:35:27,872 --> 01:35:29,339
Why would he...?

928
01:35:29,673 --> 01:35:31,004
He set you up.

929
01:35:31,142 --> 01:35:32,632
- Who?
- My father.

930
01:35:32,710 --> 01:35:34,541
You mean, he set me up?

931
01:35:34,612 --> 01:35:36,978
- Yeah.
- No.

932
01:35:38,082 --> 01:35:39,709
I don't have a brain cloud?

933
01:35:39,784 --> 01:35:44,118
Couldn't they think of something better
than "a brain cloud"?

934
01:35:45,423 --> 01:35:47,755
My whole life I've been a victim.

935
01:35:47,925 --> 01:35:50,587
I've been a dupe, a pawn.

936
01:35:51,629 --> 01:35:53,824
My throat is closing up.

937
01:35:53,898 --> 01:35:58,198
No, Joe. Your whole life is ahead of you.

938
01:35:59,537 --> 01:36:00,936
That's true.

939
01:36:01,005 --> 01:36:02,973
That's good news.

940
01:36:04,442 --> 01:36:05,875
I suppose so.

941
01:36:05,943 --> 01:36:08,912
- It's great!
- Yeah, that's good.

942
01:36:10,114 --> 01:36:13,083
I'm relieved. That's great. I'm saved!

943
01:36:16,954 --> 01:36:18,216
<i>But...</i>

944
01:36:20,524 --> 01:36:22,685
What is it now?

945
01:36:25,129 --> 01:36:28,963
We're on a raft, no land in sight.
I don't know.

946
01:36:31,469 --> 01:36:34,632
It'll always be something with you,
won't it?

947
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:37,537
Yeah.

948
01:36:39,477 --> 01:36:41,308
I'll tell you one thing:

949
01:36:41,912 --> 01:36:44,574
Wherever we go, whatever we do...

950
01:36:45,583 --> 01:36:47,915
...we're taking this luggage with us.

951
01:36:48,886 --> 01:36:50,114
Deal.

952
01:37:01,265 --> 01:37:03,130
I wonder where we'll end up?

953
01:37:03,834 --> 01:37:06,325
Away from the things of man, my love.

954
01:37:07,538 --> 01:37:09,699
Away from the things of man.
