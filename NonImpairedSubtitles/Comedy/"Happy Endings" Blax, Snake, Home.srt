00:00:01,211 --> 00:00:03,919
Here's to the one year anniversary
of you ** wedding.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,830
At least we're finally using
the free honeymoon.

3
00:00:05,917 --> 00:00:08,475
Yeah, not exactly what I thought
we'll be using it.

4
00:00:11,348 --> 00:00:15,674
Happy anniversary.
Happy anniversary!

5
00:00:15,773 --> 00:00:18,968
I'm glad you all could be here
to commemorate the worst day of my life.

6
00:00:19,045 --> 00:00:21,928
No. I thought the worst day
was **.

7
00:00:22,024 --> 00:00:24,479
***

8
00:00:24,575 --> 00:00:27,224
what about the day when
** upside down?

9
00:00:27,339 --> 00:00:30,747
♪♪ right now.

10
00:00:30,841 --> 00:00:33,633
Remember that time
when I got my **?

11
00:00:33,721 --> 00:00:35,999
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Why am I participating in this?

12
00:00:36,086 --> 00:00:37,915
- Who wants an oyster?
- Me. - Me. - Me.

13
00:00:37,994 --> 00:00:40,567
No. None for me. I'm extremely
allergic to selfish.

14
00:00:40,647 --> 00:00:48,391
Ah, yes. She gets all puking
and I gotta take her ** very rewarding.

15
00:00:48,477 --> 00:00:51,425
Wait, wait, wait, keep them away from
Dave also because he's super allergic.

16
00:00:51,524 --> 00:00:52,792
Yeah. Super allergic.

17
00:00:52,889 --> 00:00:55,745
Why **?
This is too much work.

18
00:00:55,845 --> 00:00:58,127
Penny, you're sweet
but so so dumb.

19
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,894
You want to eat your oysters
as soon as they've been **.

20
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:04,866
Now, when ** an oyster you really
wanna make sure that you get in there.

21
00:01:04,948 --> 00:01:08,125
*** ahh!

22
00:01:11,966 --> 00:01:13,875
You stabbed me, dude!

23
00:01:13,967 --> 00:01:14,927
I stabbed you, dude!

24
00:01:15,018 --> 00:01:17,870
- Oh my God.
- Guys!

25
00:01:17,961 --> 00:01:19,864
What do I do?
I got it.

26
00:01:19,945 --> 00:01:22,116
G-get my epipen. It's in my purse.
On the chair. Okay.

27
00:01:22,201 --> 00:01:25,470
Somebody get this knife out of me!
Oh, God. Ohh.

28
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:26,753
I got it! I got it!

29
00:01:26,849 --> 00:01:28,785
I got it. What do I do?

30
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:31,095
Dave. Dave, Dave, Dave! You
can't touch shellfish either.

31
00:01:31,183 --> 00:01:32,480
Oh, right.

32
00:01:32,596 --> 00:01:35,115
What do I do? I only have one shot!

33
00:01:35,185 --> 00:01:36,254
Throat's closing up.

34
00:01:36,349 --> 00:01:37,027
Oh, my God!

35
00:01:37,106 --> 00:01:38,574
Aah! What do I do?!

36
00:01:38,667 --> 00:01:40,850
Oh, all right! Okay!
I'm not allergic to shellfish.

37
00:01:40,948 --> 00:01:41,820
What?

38
00:01:41,903 --> 00:01:43,690
D-- Oh, God.
Here comes the puke.

39
00:01:43,778 --> 00:01:44,987
Well, why did you lie?

40
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:47,557
When you do it, it makes me...
I know. I know. I know.

41
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:48,364
I-I can't hear the sound.

42
00:01:48,454 --> 00:01:49,325
Okay, everybody chill!

43
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:49,915
Aah!

44
00:01:49,997 --> 00:01:52,483
Aah!
Aah!

45
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:55,112
Ohh. Ohh.

46
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:57,197
Oh!

47
00:01:57,927 --> 00:01:58,903
Oh. Ohh.

48
00:01:58,988 --> 00:02:00,655
Should we order a movie?

49
00:02:00,757 --> 00:02:02,937
"Lincoln Lawyer."
I love these opening credits.

Ladies and gays,
welcome to my new home!

52
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:21,477
Excuse me, but Max is
the only gay <i>aqui.</i>

53
00:02:21,556 --> 00:02:23,505
I don't know. A lot of people
think you're on the low.

54
00:02:23,584 --> 00:02:25,759
This is surprisingly nice.
Hmm?

55
00:02:25,842 --> 00:02:26,736
Agreed.
Yeah.

56
00:02:26,812 --> 00:02:28,111
Yeah. Wow.
It's two bedrooms,

57
00:02:28,197 --> 00:02:30,487
2 1/2 baths,
Italian marble countertops.

58
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,352
In a word, <i>amah-zing.</i>

59
00:02:32,442 --> 00:02:32,954
- Oh, just gonna ride that
into the ground, huh? - Again?

60
00:02:33,044 --> 00:02:34,007
- No, <i>please</i> stop.
- No.

61
00:02:34,096 --> 00:02:36,202
Guys, it's always been
my dream to be a homeowner,

62
00:02:36,288 --> 00:02:37,965
and I decided, why do I have
to wait to get married

63
00:02:38,052 --> 00:02:39,505
to buy my first place?

64
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,859
We are so proud of you.

65
00:02:40,947 --> 00:02:43,056
This is gonna be
the year of Penny.

66
00:02:43,146 --> 00:02:45,109
Who wants to twirl with me?

67
00:02:45,215 --> 00:02:46,778
Whoo! Whoo!

68
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,096
Whoo!

69
00:02:51,623 --> 00:02:53,223
Hooray!

70
00:02:54,658 --> 00:02:56,119
What?

71
00:02:56,687 --> 00:02:58,099
Oh, now a brother can't twirl?

72
00:02:58,955 --> 00:03:00,008
Dude, you psyched
for movie night?

73
00:03:00,092 --> 00:03:01,576
I got all the best
black-and-white classics.

74
00:03:01,672 --> 00:03:03,417
I got "Lethal Weapon,"
"Trading Places,"

75
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:04,470
"Beverly Hills Cop."

76
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:06,835
No, "Beverly Hills Cop"
is black and white <i>and</i> white.

77
00:03:06,926 --> 00:03:08,197
What about "men in black"?

78
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,947
No, that's black and white
<i>in</i> black.

79
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,213
What about "Erin Brockovich"?

80
00:03:11,326 --> 00:03:12,316
That's just white as hell.

81
00:03:12,409 --> 00:03:13,178
"Royal Tenenbaums"?

82
00:03:13,302 --> 00:03:13,884
Come on, bro.

83
00:03:13,957 --> 00:03:15,093
That's white, white,
white, white,

84
00:03:15,173 --> 00:03:16,307
white, white,
white, white, white,

85
00:03:16,433 --> 00:03:18,666
black...

86
00:03:19,552 --> 00:03:20,829
Brown...

87
00:03:21,365 --> 00:03:22,329
Then wack.

88
00:03:22,422 --> 00:03:23,525
- Damn, trick.
- Listen, man,

89
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,148
I'm not gonna be able
to make it to movie night.

90
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:26,296
Just gotta work late.

91
00:03:26,381 --> 00:03:27,491
What? This is, like,
the third time

92
00:03:27,573 --> 00:03:28,749
you bailed on me in two weeks.

93
00:03:28,828 --> 00:03:29,747
We never get to hang out
anymore.

94
00:03:29,826 --> 00:03:31,658
Dude, it's just getting crazy
over there, you know?

95
00:03:31,755 --> 00:03:34,324
Is this 'cause I stabbed you?
I said I was sorry.

96
00:03:34,425 --> 00:03:35,795
You did <i>not</i> say you were sorry.

97
00:03:35,902 --> 00:03:36,665
I did say-- I said I was s--

98
00:03:36,757 --> 00:03:38,067
No, you said,
<i>"comme ci comme ca.</i>

99
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:40,532
"That was pretty cool
how it went in your leg.

100
00:03:40,631 --> 00:03:41,950
I thought there would be
more blood."

101
00:03:42,057 --> 00:03:44,541
That's my version of an apology,
and it's pretty heartfelt.

102
00:03:44,637 --> 00:03:46,768
Come on. Let's hang out.

103
00:03:46,913 --> 00:03:48,927
Come on. I don't do well
when I'm alone.

104
00:03:49,944 --> 00:03:52,930
So...
How's Penny's new place?

105
00:03:53,014 --> 00:03:55,409
Oh, it's awesome, but you're
probably allergic to it.

106
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,092
Listen, Al, I only lied to you
because I didn't have

107
00:03:58,181 --> 00:03:59,568
the heart to tell you
that your jambalaya

108
00:03:59,658 --> 00:04:01,347
is the most disgusting thing
I've ever tasted.

109
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,563
- No offense.
- Offense.

110
00:04:02,663 --> 00:04:05,326
Guys, every couple has little
lies they tell each other.

111
00:04:05,417 --> 00:04:07,252
I mean, not Brad and me.
We're perfect, but my point is--

112
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,192
Last year Brad bought
a motorcycle, crashed it,

113
00:04:09,317 --> 00:04:11,476
and then sold the parts
to his cousin Randall.

114
00:04:11,601 --> 00:04:14,572
Pfft. (Laughs) I knew that.

115
00:04:14,677 --> 00:04:17,790
I mean, he is a... wild hog.

116
00:04:17,881 --> 00:04:20,820
Anyway, you two have a chance
to start over as friends,

117
00:04:20,923 --> 00:04:23,717
- so why don't you just clean the slate...
- Uh...

118
00:04:23,816 --> 00:04:25,941
- And just be honest with each other
from now on? - I guess we could try.

119
00:04:26,038 --> 00:04:27,461
Trust me, you will feel better.

120
00:04:27,566 --> 00:04:29,865
Okay. Um...
Yeah.

121
00:04:29,953 --> 00:04:31,029
I never really liked
your goatee.

122
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,574
Oh. Didn't-- Was not
really aware of that.

123
00:04:33,664 --> 00:04:37,568
Um... okay. Uh, I don't really
love your favorite perfume.

124
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:38,320
I hate your mom.

125
00:04:38,395 --> 00:04:39,285
Oh, ho ho ho!
Uh...

126
00:04:39,376 --> 00:04:40,353
Okay. (Chuckles) Well...

127
00:04:40,435 --> 00:04:41,233
Okay, I think that's a...

128
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:43,016
- No. No, no, no.
- Good start for today.

129
00:04:43,094 --> 00:04:44,462
She wants to play.
I can play.

130
00:04:44,572 --> 00:04:45,324
All right.

131
00:04:45,407 --> 00:04:46,757
I'm not really afraid of dogs.

132
00:04:46,847 --> 00:04:48,767
I was just afraid of what
would <i>happen</i> to a dog

133
00:04:48,886 --> 00:04:50,248
if you owned one.

134
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,547
Okay.

135
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:54,225
You know those stupid webbed
barefoot running socks?

136
00:04:54,316 --> 00:04:55,665
They weren't bad
for your calves.

137
00:04:55,747 --> 00:04:57,678
They were bad for my ability
to want to have sex with you.

138
00:04:57,772 --> 00:04:59,237
Ohh!

139
00:04:59,317 --> 00:05:01,129
That's funny.

140
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:03,652
Okay. Richard Gere is not
a hurricane Katrina denier.

141
00:05:03,749 --> 00:05:04,437
- What?
- Yeah.

142
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:05,724
I just said that to you
so we didn't have to watch

143
00:05:05,811 --> 00:05:07,584
"pretty woman"
for the 74th time.

144
00:05:07,669 --> 00:05:08,768
Well, you know
your friend Glazer?

145
00:05:08,847 --> 00:05:11,149
He didn't actually steal my bra
and sell it on craigslist.

146
00:05:11,245 --> 00:05:12,534
I just couldn't spend
another Sunday

147
00:05:12,611 --> 00:05:14,872
- watching you two play <i>frolf.</i>
- Frolf?

148
00:05:14,962 --> 00:05:16,100
Frisbee golf.
Frisbee golf.

149
00:05:16,186 --> 00:05:17,772
Okay, you know that thing
under your mantel

150
00:05:17,872 --> 00:05:19,983
that I told you was
a tiny brick closet?

151
00:05:20,071 --> 00:05:21,707
It's actually
a working fireplace.

152
00:05:21,784 --> 00:05:23,474
I was afraid you were gonna
burn the building down.

153
00:05:23,591 --> 00:05:25,226
Okay, well, I hated
that song you wrote for me.

154
00:05:25,303 --> 00:05:27,554
"Love to the power of love"?
You said it made you cry.

155
00:05:27,659 --> 00:05:30,196
It was 12 minutes long,
oh, and terrible.

156
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:31,553
- Oh, you want to know terrible?
- Yeah.

157
00:05:31,641 --> 00:05:33,927
That stupid hula-hoop dance
that you do.

158
00:05:34,004 --> 00:05:34,615
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

159
00:05:34,695 --> 00:05:36,573
Yeah, this one here,
where I take the hula-hoop,

160
00:05:36,641 --> 00:05:37,447
and I put it on, and I do this,

161
00:05:37,534 --> 00:05:38,395
and I shake it,

162
00:05:38,483 --> 00:05:40,217
- shake it, shake it?
- Still terrible.

163
00:05:40,258 --> 00:05:42,687
Bring it up. On the neck.
Look, I take it to the neck.

164
00:05:42,774 --> 00:05:44,688
- Hey, let's-- Let's...
- And you don't like this?!

165
00:05:44,785 --> 00:05:46,229
- Hoop it on down.
- You don't like this?!

166
00:05:46,308 --> 00:05:47,299
Hoop it on down.

167
00:05:47,372 --> 00:05:48,882
Wow! That was healthy.

168
00:05:48,967 --> 00:05:50,318
God, now that
you guys aren't together,

169
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:54,143
you are able to sing your songs
and hoop around

170
00:05:54,233 --> 00:05:56,655
and watch your Gere movies
and play your frolf.

171
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,801
I mean, whew.
You feel great?

172
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:01,554
Yeah.
I feel great.

173
00:06:01,621 --> 00:06:02,436
I might get bangs.
Mm.

174
00:06:02,525 --> 00:06:03,621
No, I'm not.
I'm not gonna do that.

175
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:04,781
I'm not.
Jane, you crazy.

176
00:06:04,861 --> 00:06:05,794
You know, I'm gonna go
back to work.

177
00:06:05,868 --> 00:06:07,014
Go to work!

178
00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:09,294
Thanks for helping me
pick out this lamp, Jeremy.

179
00:06:09,373 --> 00:06:10,413
Thanks for your number.

180
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,608
Thanks for asking for it.

181
00:06:11,697 --> 00:06:13,231
I'd say this afternoon
has been il...

182
00:06:13,328 --> 00:06:14,867
Luminating.

183
00:06:14,956 --> 00:06:16,098
Okay, we're gonna quit
while you're behind.

184
00:06:16,195 --> 00:06:17,110
'Cause it's a lamp.

185
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:18,491
- Yeah.
- See?

186
00:06:18,562 --> 00:06:19,972
Year of Penny is firing
on all cylinders.

187
00:06:20,057 --> 00:06:21,245
I buy a condo to prove
I don't need a guy

188
00:06:21,337 --> 00:06:22,684
to get on with my life--
Boom!

189
00:06:22,769 --> 00:06:24,633
I meet a guy I wouldn't have met
if I hadn't bought a condo

190
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,235
to prove I don't need
to get on with my life.

191
00:06:26,304 --> 00:06:27,306
We get it.
You have a condo.

192
00:06:27,402 --> 00:06:28,708
Well, it's a pretty big deal.

193
00:06:28,778 --> 00:06:29,579
What the hell?

194
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:30,331
What?

195
00:06:30,436 --> 00:06:31,899
Brad said he was gonna be
working late.

196
00:06:32,008 --> 00:06:32,703
So?

197
00:06:32,794 --> 00:06:34,721
So if that's work,
then I should be considered one

198
00:06:34,801 --> 00:06:36,486
of "Chicago business" weekly's
top 30 under 30.

199
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,003
He's just hanging
with some guys.

200
00:06:38,093 --> 00:06:39,734
Don't make a big deal
out of this.

201
00:06:39,822 --> 00:06:41,148
Are you gonna make
a big deal out of it?

202
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,737
Well, I don't think
that's a very bright...

203
00:06:42,818 --> 00:06:44,513
Idea.

204
00:06:44,606 --> 00:06:46,987
I gotta go buy a bulb and take
this lamp bit to the next level.

205
00:06:47,081 --> 00:06:48,639
I am on fire!
Year of Penny. Suck it.

206
00:06:48,719 --> 00:06:50,943
Get outta here with that, man.

207
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:52,197
Crazy, man.

208
00:06:52,295 --> 00:06:53,273
Thanks for that beer.

209
00:06:53,344 --> 00:06:55,455
That's what's up, man.
Hey, keep it cool, brother.

210
00:06:55,545 --> 00:06:56,906
All right.
That's what's up.

211
00:06:56,984 --> 00:06:57,759
Whoa.
I'm sorry. I'm s--

212
00:06:57,846 --> 00:07:00,790
L'Bradford! I do declare.

213
00:07:00,896 --> 00:07:02,513
You must be
coming from your office.

214
00:07:02,596 --> 00:07:04,076
This is a really nice office.

215
00:07:04,163 --> 00:07:05,415
Is this your fax machine
right here?

216
00:07:05,514 --> 00:07:07,478
You mind if I have a sip
of your fax machine?

217
00:07:07,587 --> 00:07:08,636
Okay.

218
00:07:08,739 --> 00:07:11,851
What a delicious fax machine!

219
00:07:11,947 --> 00:07:12,684
Just calm down.

220
00:07:12,762 --> 00:07:14,977
You lied to me, man, and now
I find you at a sports bar

221
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:16,819
with a bunch
of very attractive black men,

222
00:07:16,905 --> 00:07:18,132
one who looks like Dwyane Wade.

223
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,870
Why can't I hang out with you?

224
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:21,022
'Cause I'm white?

225
00:07:21,124 --> 00:07:23,657
No, Max.
This is a networking thing.

226
00:07:23,752 --> 00:07:26,079
I didn't not invite you
because you're white.

227
00:07:26,181 --> 00:07:28,140
It's because
you're not professional.

228
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,274
Well, I could be professional.

229
00:07:31,365 --> 00:07:32,506
Yeah.
You have a better chance

230
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:33,628
of being black
than professional.

231
00:07:33,721 --> 00:07:34,840
That's not a challenge.

232
00:07:34,935 --> 00:07:36,423
- That is not a challenge.
- I feel you.

233
00:07:36,504 --> 00:07:38,136
- What was that?
- Shy city.

234
00:07:38,242 --> 00:07:39,411
- Just don't do that.
- Ah, ha ha.

235
00:07:39,496 --> 00:07:40,950
The rock is definitely
in the building.

236
00:07:41,036 --> 00:07:42,797
- Unnecessary.
- Watch the throne, son.

237
00:07:42,874 --> 00:07:44,668
- Watch the throne, you know what
I'm sayin'?- Watch your step.

238
00:07:44,753 --> 00:07:46,894
- I don't know this man!
- It's in my blood!

239
00:07:46,946 --> 00:07:49,105
Africa! Africa!

240
00:07:51,087 --> 00:07:53,386
Welcome. You are
my first gentleman caller.

241
00:07:53,486 --> 00:07:54,625
That made me sound like
a prostitute.

242
00:07:54,716 --> 00:07:55,557
I'm not a prostitute.

243
00:07:57,091 --> 00:07:58,609
Wow.
This place is amazing.

244
00:07:58,718 --> 00:07:59,622
Thanks.

245
00:07:59,704 --> 00:08:01,674
Do you have any roommates?

246
00:08:01,778 --> 00:08:02,597
Nope.

247
00:08:02,679 --> 00:08:04,251
It is just me and you.

248
00:08:04,348 --> 00:08:08,071
Really? Wow.
I live with five guys.

249
00:08:08,148 --> 00:08:09,190
Ooh. I love guys.

250
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:10,404
Again, not a prostitute.

251
00:08:12,577 --> 00:08:14,460
Is this Italian marble?

252
00:08:14,549 --> 00:08:15,937
S-sure.

253
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,640
Yeah. I guess.

254
00:08:17,722 --> 00:08:21,204
How many square feet
is this place?

255
00:08:21,287 --> 00:08:22,666
Oh, I don't know.

256
00:08:22,745 --> 00:08:23,798
You really have your life
together.

257
00:08:23,885 --> 00:08:24,945
Is that a bad thing?

258
00:08:25,043 --> 00:08:27,084
No. I just need to... go...

259
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:29,571
Work on my resume, and...

260
00:08:29,692 --> 00:08:30,463
Oh, no, no, no, Jeremy.
I'll...

261
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:31,894
Jeremy, wait.
I know it seems like

262
00:08:31,976 --> 00:08:33,964
I have my life together,
but I am a mess, okay?

263
00:08:34,068 --> 00:08:36,021
Psycho.
I will, like, friend your mom on Facebook

264
00:08:36,094 --> 00:08:38,453
and start showing up at events
I was not invited to, okay?

265
00:08:38,533 --> 00:08:39,230
Look, you know what?

266
00:08:39,304 --> 00:08:40,279
These cabinets
are not even that nice.

267
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,967
I mean, look at this.

268
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,570
Ooh!
Is that a wine fridge?

269
00:08:44,801 --> 00:08:46,319
Jer? Jer Bear?

270
00:08:46,978 --> 00:08:49,190
Hon, Jeremy was clearly
a loser.

271
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,277
Yeah, most guys would kill
to date a girl

272
00:08:51,374 --> 00:08:52,655
- with a place like this.
- Mm-hmm.

273
00:08:52,743 --> 00:08:53,958
Last girl I dated
lived on a boat...

274
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,128
That's romantic.

275
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:57,741
Docked in the parking lot of
the pet store where she worked.

276
00:08:57,863 --> 00:08:59,736
Okay, I-I don't know
where you find people.

277
00:08:59,825 --> 00:09:00,880
You know what?
You guys are right.

278
00:09:00,961 --> 00:09:02,130
I don't even know
what I was thinking.

279
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,260
I mean, this place is great.

280
00:09:04,354 --> 00:09:05,325
I'm great.

281
00:09:05,448 --> 00:09:08,011
Year of Penny back on track!

282
00:09:08,142 --> 00:09:09,302
- Mm. Yes.
- Year of Penny!

283
00:09:09,396 --> 00:09:12,424
I am gonna take these
into the bedroom.

284
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:14,829
What's happening?

285
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:17,496
These are the running socks that
Alex didn't want me to wear.

286
00:09:17,596 --> 00:09:19,469
Can you believe that she hated these?

287
00:09:19,576 --> 00:09:21,555
Hate? No.

288
00:09:21,667 --> 00:09:24,366
Those are, uh... great.

289
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:25,290
- Right?
- Uh, yeah.

290
00:09:25,363 --> 00:09:28,126
So... I got you a pair...

291
00:09:28,228 --> 00:09:29,417
- Ohh.
- Just to say thank you

292
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:31,253
for freeing us from our lies.

293
00:09:31,932 --> 00:09:32,629
Wow.

294
00:09:32,709 --> 00:09:33,453
Let's go for a run.

295
00:09:33,534 --> 00:09:34,480
Oh! Good. Yeah.

296
00:09:34,556 --> 00:09:35,966
What's this--
What's this color?

297
00:09:36,045 --> 00:09:36,983
Like, an aquaflage?

298
00:09:37,063 --> 00:09:38,135
Yeah.
I hope you like the color.

299
00:09:38,228 --> 00:09:40,958
Oh, yeah. No, Jane loves
a good aquaf--

300
00:09:41,045 --> 00:09:42,661
I'm gonna go try--
I'm gonna give 'em--

301
00:09:42,739 --> 00:09:44,739
I'm gonna try 'em on.

302
00:09:46,178 --> 00:09:50,085
Hi. I'm Mrs. Sarner from 3G.
Welcome to the building.

303
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,556
It's nice to see a couple
buying this place.

304
00:09:52,641 --> 00:09:53,353
- Oh, it's, uh, it's--
- Oh, no. We're not--

305
00:09:53,446 --> 00:09:54,279
- No.
- We're not...

306
00:09:54,379 --> 00:09:57,594
'Cause the last two ladies who
owned this condo were so sad.

307
00:09:57,695 --> 00:09:59,115
They both died alone.

308
00:09:59,233 --> 00:10:01,174
That is something
that was not disclosed to me.

309
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:04,047
Some people in the building
even think this unit is cursed.

310
00:10:04,133 --> 00:10:05,538
Isn't that crazy?

311
00:10:05,644 --> 00:10:09,299
As if a condominium could turn
a gal into a sad spinster.

312
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,227
These cookies are cran-apple.

313
00:10:13,473 --> 00:10:14,912
Thanks.

314
00:10:15,011 --> 00:10:16,020
Enjoy.

315
00:10:16,097 --> 00:10:18,911
Thank you.
See you at the mixer.

316
00:10:20,441 --> 00:10:22,536
Penny, relax.
This place is not cursed.

317
00:10:22,634 --> 00:10:23,383
Penny.

318
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,694
You didn't
tell me you got a cat.

319
00:10:25,793 --> 00:10:26,897
He is so cute.

320
00:10:26,996 --> 00:10:28,710
Aw. You <i>are</i> cute.

321
00:10:28,792 --> 00:10:30,620
Wait. I didn't get a cat,

322
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:33,391
because...
Cats are for spinsters.

323
00:10:33,481 --> 00:10:34,500
Is it cold in here?

324
00:10:34,582 --> 00:10:36,626
I need a housecoat
and a hot tea with lemon.

325
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:38,007
Should I get
an AOL e-mail address?

326
00:10:38,086 --> 00:10:39,132
What's happening to me?!

327
00:10:40,884 --> 00:10:41,999
So this isn't your cat?

328
00:10:42,171 --> 00:10:43,149
No!

329
00:10:44,871 --> 00:10:45,617
Ugh.

330
00:10:46,991 --> 00:10:48,107
Max, why do we keep watching

331
00:10:48,199 --> 00:10:51,188
- the same "Lethal Weapon" scene over and over again?
- 'Cause I lost my murtaugh.

332
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,935
I don't understand
most of what my friends say.

333
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:53,809
Brad doesn't want me

334
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:56,251
joining his stupid
professional networking group.

335
00:10:56,367 --> 00:10:58,594
Oh, fuzzy face. Come on.

336
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:00,506
You said you'd watch all these
Richard Gere movies with me.

337
00:11:00,594 --> 00:11:02,749
I heard "Primal Fear" has
a very cool surprise ending.

338
00:11:02,842 --> 00:11:03,823
Gere finds out
that Norton was lying

339
00:11:03,895 --> 00:11:05,004
about his split personality

340
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:06,484
and that he murdered
the archbishop.

341
00:11:06,585 --> 00:11:08,134
Come on. Okay, uh,
what about "Unfaithful"?

342
00:11:08,219 --> 00:11:09,204
Gere bashes
the French guy's head in

343
00:11:09,276 --> 00:11:10,354
with a snow globe.

344
00:11:10,435 --> 00:11:11,297
You're killing me.

345
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:12,448
Just like tumors killed
Winona Ryder

346
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,116
in "Autumn In New York."

347
00:11:14,225 --> 00:11:15,105
Why are you doing this?

348
00:11:15,181 --> 00:11:17,143
<i>Hello,</i> Alex!

349
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:19,272
Oh, nice socks.
You look like a gay ninja.

350
00:11:19,361 --> 00:11:21,431
I am gonna go for a run
with Jane.

351
00:11:21,508 --> 00:11:23,752
Oh! And I called glaze
earlier.

352
00:11:23,843 --> 00:11:25,561
Good convo. Tough, yes.

353
00:11:25,657 --> 00:11:27,221
There were tears
because of your lies,

354
00:11:27,313 --> 00:11:29,488
but, uh, I'm gonna go play
some frolf with him,

355
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:30,327
make him feel better.

356
00:11:30,405 --> 00:11:31,621
Well, I wish I could watch
you nerds,

357
00:11:31,705 --> 00:11:33,226
but I've gotta make more
jambalaya.

358
00:11:33,311 --> 00:11:34,849
People are going crazy for it
at the store.

359
00:11:34,937 --> 00:11:37,460
Really? Women are just going
crazy for trying on clothes

360
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,160
and eating hot seafood soup?

361
00:11:40,512 --> 00:11:42,228
They can't get enough
of that hot seafood soup?

362
00:11:42,313 --> 00:11:43,508
Yeah.

363
00:11:48,309 --> 00:11:49,816
I've had the worst day ever.

364
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:50,654
Ew.

365
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:51,743
Morning started with frolf...

366
00:11:51,826 --> 00:11:53,256
<i>Dave, glaze, myself.</i>

367
00:11:53,355 --> 00:11:54,557
- Ohh!
- Ow!

368
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:56,440
<i>And since I told Alex</i>
<i>she'd be a great dog owner,</i>

369
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:57,717
<i>we went to the shelter,</i>
<i>but turns out</i>

370
00:11:57,796 --> 00:11:59,590
<i>she's only qualified</i>
<i>to take care of a snake.</i>

371
00:11:59,673 --> 00:12:01,344
I'm naming him Tyler.

372
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,343
<i>Then I stupidly encouraged Dave</i>
<i>to record his song.</i>

373
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:06,188
♪ Love times love ♪

374
00:12:06,264 --> 00:12:09,084
♪ divided by love ♪

375
00:12:09,175 --> 00:12:11,324
♪ equals love ♪

376
00:12:11,412 --> 00:12:13,989
♪ to the power of love ♪

377
00:12:14,065 --> 00:12:15,546
<i>Then it was back to Alex's,</i>
<i>where she wanted to prove</i>

378
00:12:15,629 --> 00:12:16,869
<i>she could make a fire.</i>

379
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:19,517
I'm not... sure
you should be feeding peeps

380
00:12:19,658 --> 00:12:21,403
to the snake.

381
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:22,543
He seems a little bit off.

382
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:23,463
No, he loves them.

383
00:12:23,554 --> 00:12:25,141
What about the flue, al?

384
00:12:25,229 --> 00:12:26,696
Snakes don't get the <i>flu.</i>

385
00:12:26,792 --> 00:12:28,030
Did you even open it?

386
00:12:28,112 --> 00:12:28,932
What?

387
00:12:29,011 --> 00:12:30,881
Did you use charcoal
to make a fire?!

388
00:12:32,154 --> 00:12:33,095
Oh, Jane.

389
00:12:33,188 --> 00:12:34,220
Kind of ironic, isn't it?

390
00:12:34,306 --> 00:12:36,152
You see, you pushed
Dave and Alex to stop lying,

391
00:12:36,228 --> 00:12:38,412
but now all <i>you</i> can do
is lie to them.

392
00:12:40,543 --> 00:12:44,027
You're doing exactly what
you don't want them to do.

393
00:12:44,115 --> 00:12:45,198
Look at you, all dirty,

394
00:12:45,292 --> 00:12:48,066
- just covered in lies.
- Yeah, I see. That's funny.

395
00:12:48,154 --> 00:12:50,052
You want to tell me about that
motorcycle you bought last year?

396
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:51,520
Hmm? What?

397
00:12:51,634 --> 00:12:53,988
Run you a bubble bath?
Okay.

398
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:55,708
- Mm. Mm-hmm.
- All right.

399
00:12:57,748 --> 00:12:58,690
A bag of pennies in her face.

400
00:13:01,468 --> 00:13:05,356
Maxwell Blum, JD, DDS, esquire.

401
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:06,307
How's it going?

402
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:07,335
"JD, DDS"?

403
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:08,924
You're a lawyer <i>and</i> a dentist?

404
00:13:09,017 --> 00:13:10,814
I like cleaning teeth.
Sue me.

405
00:13:10,902 --> 00:13:12,553
Hey, Max, can I talk to you
for a second?

406
00:13:12,648 --> 00:13:13,943
Talk is cheap. Am I right?

407
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:15,601
Let's get down
to some brass tacks.

408
00:13:15,681 --> 00:13:17,068
What's going on
with this debt ceiling?

409
00:13:17,145 --> 00:13:18,173
Does China own us?

410
00:13:18,267 --> 00:13:19,825
I want to join
your professional group.

411
00:13:20,172 --> 00:13:21,015
You guys network so well.

412
00:13:21,102 --> 00:13:22,291
Professionals' group?

413
00:13:22,363 --> 00:13:24,940
I haven't had a job
in, what, like, five years?

414
00:13:25,051 --> 00:13:26,691
Unless you count sleeping
till 1:00

415
00:13:26,798 --> 00:13:28,739
and trying to bring back
the phrase "bust a move"

416
00:13:28,826 --> 00:13:29,680
as a job.

417
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,007
Oh, my God.

418
00:13:31,113 --> 00:13:33,385
You're, like, black Max.
You're-- You...

419
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,861
You're <i>blax!</i>

420
00:13:34,984 --> 00:13:36,599
Hold up.

421
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,857
Is this white Daryl?

422
00:13:40,764 --> 00:13:42,549
I am not white Daryl,

423
00:13:42,665 --> 00:13:43,657
and you lied to me again.

424
00:13:43,741 --> 00:13:45,341
Look, sometimes
I just wanna hang out

425
00:13:45,442 --> 00:13:46,161
with the brothas.

426
00:13:46,252 --> 00:13:47,200
Why are you talking like that?

427
00:13:47,299 --> 00:13:48,239
'Cause I was hangin' out
with the brothas,

428
00:13:48,332 --> 00:13:50,467
and it takes a little while for
it to go away. See? It's gone.

429
00:13:50,567 --> 00:13:52,668
Sometimes I just need a break

430
00:13:52,762 --> 00:13:55,545
from talking about npr
and recycling or...

431
00:13:55,649 --> 00:13:56,880
That awesome chest pass

432
00:13:56,984 --> 00:13:58,874
- Steve Nash made.
- Oh, really, fam?

433
00:13:58,978 --> 00:14:00,819
- Yeah. - Now you're gonna
pull out that Steve Nash card

434
00:14:00,904 --> 00:14:02,518
- on a brotha. - Wait. Why are
<i>you</i> talking like that?

435
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:03,437
Because we're all, you know,

436
00:14:03,528 --> 00:14:04,296
everybody's with the brothers,

437
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,396
and we're all hanging out
and talking like that.

438
00:14:06,473 --> 00:14:07,764
Look, I didn't tell you
because you get all crazy

439
00:14:07,865 --> 00:14:09,565
any time you feel excluded
from something.

440
00:14:09,664 --> 00:14:10,598
That's...

441
00:14:10,747 --> 00:14:11,879
Hey, Brad.

442
00:14:11,978 --> 00:14:12,660
If I hook you up

443
00:14:12,747 --> 00:14:14,072
with a partially used
borders gift card,

444
00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:16,531
you think you would give me
a ride to small claims court?

445
00:14:16,618 --> 00:14:18,922
Crap. Damn it.
I <i>am</i> white Daryl.

446
00:14:20,578 --> 00:14:23,316
I'm totally fine, Jane.
I took the cat to a shelter,

447
00:14:23,426 --> 00:14:25,211
and I know
my apartment's not cursed.

448
00:14:25,328 --> 00:14:27,139
Oh, and I decided
to have a housewarming party,

449
00:14:27,228 --> 00:14:29,944
roaring '20s theme,
so it looks like

450
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,803
the year of Penny
is back in full...

451
00:14:31,891 --> 00:14:33,619
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

452
00:14:34,553 --> 00:14:35,969
What the hell
is with all the cats?

453
00:14:39,633 --> 00:14:41,135
No. Come on.
Just get to steppin'.

454
00:14:41,207 --> 00:14:43,045
Get on now.
Move it along. Come on.

455
00:14:43,124 --> 00:14:44,804
Get out! Get out!

456
00:14:44,907 --> 00:14:47,262
Shoo! Shoo!

457
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,641
Okay, Penny.

458
00:14:50,776 --> 00:14:52,028
Calm down.

459
00:14:52,719 --> 00:14:55,793
Get some wine. Take a breath.

460
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,932
Just watch some tv.

461
00:14:57,031 --> 00:15:00,419
<i>Aah! Aah!</i>

462
00:15:04,638 --> 00:15:05,819
Why is the DVR filled

463
00:15:05,912 --> 00:15:08,263
with "the good wife"
and "the view"?

464
00:15:08,347 --> 00:15:09,383
I didn't record these.

465
00:15:09,507 --> 00:15:11,982
These are for lonely women
who talk to themselves.

466
00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:13,954
Oh, my God! I'm talking to myself.

467
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,647
"Single meals for one"?

468
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,101
"Personal pizzas"?

469
00:15:28,918 --> 00:15:30,542
"Personal pizzas."

470
00:15:36,074 --> 00:15:37,662
Jane, you're not wearing
your running socks.

471
00:15:37,761 --> 00:15:39,531
Oh, yeah.

472
00:15:39,614 --> 00:15:42,440
I am bummed, too, glaze,
but Penny wanted it

473
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:45,293
to be historically correct
with the 1920s theme, so...

474
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:46,175
Grr...

475
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:47,357
Ooh, well,
then I'll just go Polish

476
00:15:47,441 --> 00:15:49,014
the China
in the servants' quarters.

477
00:15:50,098 --> 00:15:51,835
You don't Polish China.

478
00:15:54,502 --> 00:15:55,166
'Sup?

479
00:15:55,243 --> 00:15:57,185
'Sup... with you?

480
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:59,262
Shouldn't you be getting ready
for your big party?

481
00:15:59,377 --> 00:16:01,693
It's already happening.

482
00:16:05,637 --> 00:16:07,317
Pen. Pen. You okay?

483
00:16:07,434 --> 00:16:08,576
Like anybody cares.

484
00:16:08,675 --> 00:16:09,595
Give me the ice cream.

485
00:16:09,694 --> 00:16:12,785
Okay. Got another one.

486
00:16:12,882 --> 00:16:13,776
Okay, how did you--

487
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:14,807
Ah.

488
00:16:15,476 --> 00:16:16,978
All right, g-give me
the couch ice cream...

489
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,825
Ohh.
And let's get you dressed.

490
00:16:18,906 --> 00:16:20,318
Just leave me alone, Jane.

491
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:21,551
Give me the ground ice cream...

492
00:16:21,654 --> 00:16:22,513
Mnh.

493
00:16:22,585 --> 00:16:24,079
And let's get you dressed.

494
00:16:24,147 --> 00:16:25,445
- Go. Go.
- Come on. Let's go.

495
00:16:25,546 --> 00:16:26,974
Hey, <i>Brad.</i>

496
00:16:28,131 --> 00:16:30,482
How's it goin'?

497
00:16:30,577 --> 00:16:33,363
Oh. Where are my manners?
These are my gay friends.

498
00:16:33,448 --> 00:16:35,193
You know, sometimes you just
wanna hang out with your peeps.

499
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:36,239
Right.

500
00:16:36,305 --> 00:16:37,942
Anyway, this is Connor.
He's enormous.

501
00:16:38,027 --> 00:16:39,608
This is Joel. He's silent.

502
00:16:39,701 --> 00:16:42,080
And this is Steve.
We call him gay Brad.

503
00:16:42,183 --> 00:16:44,023
No, we don't,
and my name's Ken.

504
00:16:44,122 --> 00:16:45,588
- And he's Asian.
- He's Asian? Pfft.

505
00:16:45,678 --> 00:16:47,762
I don't see skin color
or eye shape.

506
00:16:47,853 --> 00:16:49,098
Anyway, let's get out
of here, guys.

507
00:16:49,191 --> 00:16:50,916
These straight folks
are bringing me down.

508
00:16:51,013 --> 00:16:52,667
- Let's go talk about gay stuff.
- Ooh!

509
00:16:52,748 --> 00:16:54,746
- Gay stuff?
- That's right, Brad.

510
00:16:54,844 --> 00:16:57,036
Gay stuff. Come on.

511
00:16:57,205 --> 00:16:59,444
Don't you wish they made
trading cards of designers?

512
00:17:01,929 --> 00:17:02,700
Ah.

513
00:17:02,803 --> 00:17:04,158
Ohh. Really, Alex?

514
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,313
You're gonna serve
that disgusting jambalaya?

515
00:17:06,402 --> 00:17:09,595
This is a housewarming party,
not a house-clearing party.

516
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:12,907
Boom! Poetry slam.

517
00:17:12,988 --> 00:17:14,908
Oh, uh, heard you went
down to the shelter,

518
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,311
and they wouldn't let you
have a dog,

519
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:18,079
so you had to get a snake
instead.

520
00:17:18,184 --> 00:17:19,360
Had to? No, no, no, no.

521
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:21,997
I chose Tyler, okay?
Dogs are played out

522
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:24,565
with their whole "soft,
cuddly best friend" thing.

523
00:17:24,685 --> 00:17:26,745
Honestly, on a scale of
fur to scales, I prefer scales.

524
00:17:27,734 --> 00:17:30,119
Well, things have been going
pretty awesome with me, too.

525
00:17:30,222 --> 00:17:31,704
Been frolfing and jamming,

526
00:17:31,776 --> 00:17:33,948
and, uh, my song turned out
so great that

527
00:17:34,043 --> 00:17:37,023
glaze put it on his web site--
defglazerecords.com.

528
00:17:37,107 --> 00:17:38,123
Dot org was taken.

529
00:17:38,198 --> 00:17:39,422
Been getting tons of hits.

530
00:17:39,532 --> 00:17:40,677
Don't make a big deal
about it, baby.

531
00:17:40,745 --> 00:17:41,357
That's awesome.

532
00:17:41,428 --> 00:17:42,754
Maybe you should play it here
for everyone.

533
00:17:42,845 --> 00:17:43,804
- Yeah!
- No.

534
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:44,314
- Here.
- Bro.

535
00:17:44,403 --> 00:17:45,104
- No.
- Yeah.

536
00:17:45,192 --> 00:17:46,443
- Bro.
- Bro.

537
00:17:46,527 --> 00:17:48,610
I didn't bring my guitar.
I-I can't--

538
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,047
That's all right. He's got one.
Why don't you ask him?

539
00:17:50,134 --> 00:17:52,563
Uh, yeah, um...

540
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,464
Do you really think
I can pull off

541
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,347
that slim-fit James Perse
crew neck t-shirt?

542
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,361
As long as I can be there
when you pull it off.

543
00:17:58,542 --> 00:17:59,795
What's happening here?

544
00:17:59,897 --> 00:18:01,105
I was just talkin' tees
with my B's,

545
00:18:01,195 --> 00:18:02,720
who are "G,"
'cause they like "D."

546
00:18:02,813 --> 00:18:04,813
- Oh, yeah.
- Pound it.

547
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:07,458
No! Gay Brad,
you do not pound Brad Brad.

548
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:09,109
Gays, inside. Go!

549
00:18:09,211 --> 00:18:10,127
You guys can pound me.

550
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:11,504
Why can't I pound
your friends, man?

551
00:18:11,594 --> 00:18:12,914
Because they're not my friends!

552
00:18:12,989 --> 00:18:14,284
They're just some guys
I met at the gym

553
00:18:14,366 --> 00:18:15,790
who are way too
into the roaring '20s.

554
00:18:15,891 --> 00:18:17,308
What is going on with you, man?

555
00:18:17,381 --> 00:18:18,792
- I'm freaking out!
- About what?!

556
00:18:19,023 --> 00:18:20,106
We used to hang out
all the time, right?

557
00:18:20,186 --> 00:18:21,403
And then you got married
to Jane,

558
00:18:21,496 --> 00:18:23,357
and you got
this big, fancy job.

559
00:18:23,441 --> 00:18:24,920
I-I barely ever see you
anymore,

560
00:18:25,009 --> 00:18:25,997
and the free time
you do have--

561
00:18:26,088 --> 00:18:27,353
You spend it with other people.

562
00:18:27,431 --> 00:18:28,368
Dude...

563
00:18:28,484 --> 00:18:31,301
We're always gonna have stuff
going on in our lives, man.

564
00:18:31,399 --> 00:18:34,736
- Well, me, you know, my life.
- Your life's pretty much--

565
00:18:34,828 --> 00:18:35,553
- Of course.
- Yeah, yeah.

566
00:18:35,644 --> 00:18:36,908
But you're my riggs, trick.

567
00:18:36,989 --> 00:18:38,431
I am, ho?

568
00:18:38,526 --> 00:18:39,563
Come on, fella.

569
00:18:39,665 --> 00:18:41,604
You know murtaugh would
never bail on riggs,

570
00:18:42,442 --> 00:18:44,157
even when real-life riggs
gets super racist

571
00:18:44,246 --> 00:18:45,962
and verbally abusive
towards his boo.

572
00:18:46,065 --> 00:18:49,399
I love you the most, man.

Everything you've done

in the past few days
has been pretty stupid.

599

You almost burned down
your apartment.

And, Penny, oh, my God.

601

Is your breakdown sponsored
by Dreyer's?

Look, you're not gonna turn
into an old spinster

just because you bought
a condo,

is not cursed.

605

Okay, yeah, Jane?

606
00:19:49,376 --> 00:19:50,800
Then you want to explain
about all the cats?

607
00:19:50,903 --> 00:19:54,345
Wait. You found my cats?
I live next door.

608
00:19:54,435 --> 00:19:56,832
I've trained them to crawl
into vents and open windows.

609
00:19:58,161 --> 00:19:59,391
Fair enough. Okay.

610
00:19:59,492 --> 00:20:01,473
Then what about all the episodes
of "the view" on my tv?

611
00:20:01,564 --> 00:20:03,164
Uh, you didn't erase those,
did you?

612
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,091
'Cause I can't DVR "the view"
at home anymore,

613
00:20:05,185 --> 00:20:06,505
'cause my DVR is filled
with episodes of "the view,"

614
00:20:06,594 --> 00:20:07,787
so I have to DVR it here.

615
00:20:07,867 --> 00:20:09,446
Okay, then does someone
want to explain to me

616
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:12,077
this coupon
for personal pizzas,

617

00:20:48,048 --> 00:20:49,482
Yeah, works for us.

633
00:20:50,266 --> 00:20:51,781
Stop having a moment, you two.

634
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:53,463
Toast.

635
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,578
<i>♪</i>

636
00:20:55,676 --> 00:20:56,604
Thank you.

637
00:20:56,891 --> 00:20:57,814
To my friends.

638
00:20:57,948 --> 00:20:59,718
I know I'll never be sad
and alone,

639
00:20:59,802 --> 00:21:01,238
because I'll always have you.

640
00:21:01,335 --> 00:21:02,640
Pen, you know you're not
gonna be alone.

641
00:21:02,721 --> 00:21:03,822
Aw. Thanks, Al.

642
00:21:03,913 --> 00:21:05,530
No, literally, 'cause I need
to move in for a while.

643
00:21:05,627 --> 00:21:07,228
Jane wasn't kidding.
I smoked out my apartment,

644
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:08,652
and there's a snake loose
that's mad at me,

645
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:09,912
'cause I probably gave him
diabetes.

646
00:21:11,388 --> 00:21:12,382
Roomies?

647
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:13,415
If you'll have me?

648
00:21:13,514 --> 00:21:15,246
- Yes! Yes!
- Yes?

649
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:16,554
Aw.

650
00:21:18,046 --> 00:21:19,421
- Bring it in.
- Okay.

651
00:21:19,507 --> 00:21:20,237
Cheers.

652
00:21:20,334 --> 00:21:21,271
Cheers.
