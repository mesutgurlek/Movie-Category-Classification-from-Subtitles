remember that as many, if not more,

from relaxing on the warm, dry sand

To avoid the possibility of cramps,
one should wait at least an hour.

166

with these muscular contortions...

168
00:33:18,887 --> 00:33:21,037
..do not become panic-stricken.

169
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:24,563
Lie perfectly still.

170
00:33:24,727 --> 00:33:29,482
Always remember that the
human body is lighter than water,

171
00:33:29,647 --> 00:33:33,925
therefore making it absolutely
impossible to sink.

172
00:33:38,087 --> 00:33:43,923
Diving is an exact science, only to
be attempted with expert instruction.

173
00:33:44,087 --> 00:33:49,719
Using the chart, we first learn the correct
form and mechanics of diving.

174
00:33:49,887 --> 00:33:54,597
The board is set into motion
by the springy step of the approach run,

175
00:33:54,767 --> 00:33:58,123
the crouch is timed
to the oscillation of the springboard,

176
00:33:58,287 --> 00:34:01,802
so as to launch the diver
easily into the jack-knife,

177
00:34:01,967 --> 00:34:08,315
the swan dive, or many others
too numerous to mention.

178
00:34:09,327 --> 00:34:14,959
Now, together with the chart,
let us put these theories into practice.

179
00:34:15,127 --> 00:34:18,517
Only the analytical eye
of the slow-motion camera

180
00:34:18,687 --> 00:34:22,885
can capture the grace
and beauty of diving.

181
00:34:56,407 --> 00:35:01,322
Now, like a feather, glide smoothly
into that masterpiece of motion,

182
00:35:01,487 --> 00:35:03,876
the graceful swan dive.

183
00:35:04,447 --> 00:35:06,244
(CRUNCH!)

184
00:35:06,407 --> 00:35:11,527
lt is customary to have the pool
filled with water.

185
00:35:17,807 --> 00:35:20,640
Ah! Surf bathing.

186
00:36:08,527 --> 00:36:14,796
As the setting sun slowly dips into
the azure blue of the western sea...

187
00:36:20,767 --> 00:36:24,237
..reluctantly, we close
on this tranquil scene,

188
00:36:24,407 --> 00:36:29,720
with a firm conviction that everyone
should learn how to swim.

189
00:36:31,527 --> 00:36:34,724
- Goofy.
- Hooray for Goofy!

190
00:36:34,887 --> 00:36:39,039
Goofy's my favourite
because he's absent-minded like me.

191
00:36:39,207 --> 00:36:42,722
He's the clumsiest,
and always getting into trouble.

192
00:36:42,887 --> 00:36:46,004
l really like Goofy because...
he's clumsy.

193
00:36:46,167 --> 00:36:49,842
l like Goofy because he's a bit clumsy,
so he's like me.

194
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:52,601
He's a bit crazy, he gets distracted.

195
00:36:52,887 --> 00:36:55,765
How to fish.

196
00:36:55,807 --> 00:37:00,961
Successful angling no longer
depends upon fishermen's luck,

197
00:37:01,127 --> 00:37:06,281
for today fishing has become
a truly fascinating science.

198
00:37:07,567 --> 00:37:13,085
When to fish can be determined
by the astrological signs of the zodiac,

199
00:37:13,247 --> 00:37:19,356
whose countless stars and planets
control the tides of the earth's waters.

200
00:37:19,527 --> 00:37:25,238
Hence, when Neptune enters
the constellation of Piscus, or Fishes,

201
00:37:25,407 --> 00:37:32,358
the cosmic vibrations create, in the fish,
an uncontrollable desire to bite.

202
00:37:32,527 --> 00:37:35,121
When the earth
enters this celestial orbit,

203
00:37:35,287 --> 00:37:41,396
it too falls under the powerful
influence of these vibrations.

204
00:37:41,967 --> 00:37:48,042
Now, let us observe the effect
of this phenomenon on man.

205
00:37:48,207 --> 00:37:53,520
Dormant within his bosom
slumbers an inert instinct to fish.

206
00:37:53,687 --> 00:37:57,680
This desire becomes acute
only through bodily contact

207
00:37:57,847 --> 00:38:02,523
with the cosmic undulations
of Piscus, or Fishes.

208
00:38:02,687 --> 00:38:09,286
This creates a mental malady known
as ''fisher's febris'', or fishing fever.

209
00:38:14,327 --> 00:38:20,004
During this trance-like period,
the angler checks his fishing tackle

210
00:38:20,167 --> 00:38:25,116
and succumbs to an overwhelming
desire to test his casting skill.

211
00:38:25,287 --> 00:38:29,917
A deft flick of the wrist,
whip of the pole, tug of the line, and...

212
00:38:30,087 --> 00:38:35,480
..the angler can easily imagine
a fighting fish in a crystal pool.

213
00:38:37,847 --> 00:38:40,281
Where to fish?

214
00:38:40,447 --> 00:38:44,998
Ah, the beauty of the sunrise
o'er the high rugged mountains.

215
00:38:45,167 --> 00:38:48,716
The freshness
of the early-morning dew.

(THUNDER)

217
00:38:51,047 --> 00:38:54,642
The joy of sleeping
in the great out-of-doors.

218
00:38:54,807 --> 00:39:01,155
The fisherman awakens at dawn,
impressed with his closeness to nature.

219
00:39:03,647 --> 00:39:08,482
Ah, to breathe deeply
of that pure, rarefied mountain air.

220
00:39:17,767 --> 00:39:19,723
The trout.

221
00:39:19,887 --> 00:39:24,563
The mountain trout
is an alert, intelligent creature.

222
00:39:24,727 --> 00:39:30,359
A fighter of the first water,
rugged, strong, daring.

223
00:39:33,967 --> 00:39:39,121
His dauntless fortitude
makes him absolutely fearless.

224
00:39:42,527 --> 00:39:46,406

(WHlSPERS) Slip up quietly
through any shrub or bush,

226
00:39:51,247 --> 00:39:54,364
and don't let the fish see you coming.

227
00:40:00,207 --> 00:40:04,086
Uh-oh. Now you've done it.

228
00:40:04,247 --> 00:40:09,367
Once the pool is disturbed,
a fish can never be enticed to bite.

229
00:40:20,887 --> 00:40:22,798
Fly fishing.

230
00:40:22,967 --> 00:40:29,202
The fly fisherman must know
how his tackle appears to the fish.

231
00:40:30,207 --> 00:40:34,166
Therefore, through the eyes
of the fish, we view the angler.

232
00:40:35,967 --> 00:40:41,519
The tempting fly...
Study carefully the reaction of the fish.

(HOWLS OF LAUGHTER)

234
00:40:47,967 --> 00:40:51,164
The lure is scientifically designed.

235
00:40:51,327 --> 00:40:58,119
When dropped into water, the resulting
optical illusion creates a realistic effect.

(CHA-CHA MUSIC)

237
00:41:29,647 --> 00:41:35,597
To cast the lure, select a spot free
from overhanging brush and limbs.

238
00:41:35,767 --> 00:41:40,318
Swing the arm with a liquid,
rhythmical motion.

239
00:41:47,967 --> 00:41:54,918
The lure skims over the water
to land lightly into that deep pool.

240
00:42:08,887 --> 00:42:14,519
The perfect catch! The line sings,
and the poor fish is really hooked.

Skiing is fast becoming
the most popular of all winter sports.

265

And small wonder, for there is no finer
conquest than that of a mountain,

clad in its glorious winter mantle
of glittering white.

267

..who leaps from his bed at sun-up,
anticipating the thrills that lie in store.

271
00:44:54,287 --> 00:44:57,165
The first essential
is the correct equipment.

272
00:44:57,327 --> 00:45:01,479
Of primary importance
is the undergarment,

273
00:45:01,647 --> 00:45:07,199
either one- or two-piece,
pre-shrunk and form-fitting.

274
00:45:11,487 --> 00:45:15,844
The skis should be made
of seasoned hickory,

275
00:45:16,007 --> 00:45:19,716
and free from knot-holes and termites.

276
00:45:21,567 --> 00:45:26,641
The shoes should be box-toed,
large enough for two pairs of socks,

277
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:31,119
yet comfortable enough
to wiggle your toes, slightly.

278
00:45:32,967 --> 00:45:36,642
And now... Now...

280

..with the exception of the trousers!

285
00:46:20,767 --> 00:46:25,636
The trousers should be light,
with a hard, smooth finish.

286
00:46:25,807 --> 00:46:31,757
They should fit snugly, yet allow
plenty of room at the hips and knees.

Now we are all set

Upon reaching the summit,
our first step is the turn into position.

295
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:27,640
This is accomplished by the kick turn.

296
00:47:27,807 --> 00:47:31,038
One, knees and skis close together.

297
00:47:31,207 --> 00:47:34,199
Two, firm support on both poles.

298
00:47:34,367 --> 00:47:39,236
Now, a decided kick of left leg
and ski, forward and high.

299
00:47:39,407 --> 00:47:42,046
Three, bring ski down parallel,

300
00:47:42,207 --> 00:47:45,279
but with the point facing
in the opposite direction.

301
00:47:45,447 --> 00:47:50,123
Four, swing the other ski around
and drop it parallel to the first ski.

302
00:47:50,287 --> 00:47:55,839
This is quite simple and can be
mastered by the greenest amateur.

303
00:47:59,247 --> 00:48:04,162
This is indeed fortunate.
How, technically, to get up.

304
00:48:04,327 --> 00:48:11,881
First, get the skis together, place them
parallel and across the down slope.

305
00:48:12,047 --> 00:48:15,756
Then place both poles
across your body.

306
00:48:15,927 --> 00:48:20,000
Pull your skis under your body
and gently push up.

307
00:48:21,527 --> 00:48:25,440
You are now in an upright position.

308
00:48:25,607 --> 00:48:28,963
For the first attempt,
choose a gentle slope.

309
00:48:29,127 --> 00:48:34,076
We start with a joyous hop stroke.
We are off!

310
00:48:39,767 --> 00:48:45,637
Always keep the eyes to the front
because objects can appear suddenly.

311
00:48:52,967 --> 00:48:57,836
Skiing is really quite simple
once you get the hang of it.

312
00:48:58,967 --> 00:49:06,317
A popular method of ascent is the
herringbone, used on short climbs.

313
00:49:06,487 --> 00:49:11,959
The name herringbone is derived
from the neat pattern left in the snow.

314
00:49:15,527 --> 00:49:20,282
Now, to change direction
at high speed. First, the jump turn.

315
00:49:20,447 --> 00:49:26,124
This looks difficult, but once learned
it becomes extremely simple.

316

The shoosh, or downhill run. lt's the
quickest way to get to the bottom.

00:49:44,927 --> 00:49:49,125
lt is so named because
of its peculiar sound. Shoosh!

318
00:49:54,727 --> 00:49:57,366
(GOOFY SCREAMS)

319
00:49:59,847 --> 00:50:06,241
The slalom, or downhill racing,
should only be attempted by experts.

320
00:50:20,687 --> 00:50:22,962
(YODELLING)

321
00:50:24,887 --> 00:50:29,597
And now, that thrill of thrills,
the goal of every ambitious skier:

322
00:50:29,767 --> 00:50:32,520
the ski jump.

323
00:50:32,767 --> 00:50:35,042
(GOOFY SCREAMS)

324
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:41,365
Ever faster and faster,
a vertical human bullet.

325
00:50:41,527 --> 00:50:48,080
Ah, the flight through the air
with the grace and beauty of a bird.

326
00:50:48,247 --> 00:50:52,923
Perfectly balanced, the complete
master of his own destiny.

327
00:51:14,927 --> 00:51:17,725
After a vigorous day in the open,

328
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:22,802
the skier never has any trouble
falling to sleep.

329
00:51:27,007 --> 00:51:29,316
- Bye!
- Goodbye from London.

330
00:51:29,487 --> 00:51:32,604
- Goodbye, Goofy, from Milan.
- Goodbye.

331
00:51:32,767 --> 00:51:37,158
- Bye-bye.
- Goodbye.
