The Family Man - 25 fps

1
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,600
This will be the final
boarding call for flight 2...

2
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,080
to London, Heathrow.

3
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,040
Okay.

4
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,760
I'm not even
gonna say it, Kate.

5
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,320
Then it'll be
like I never left.

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,840
Okay?

7
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,240
Wait.

8
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,960
I have a really bad feeling
about this.

9
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,120
About the plane?

10
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,400
You think it's gonna crash?
Don't say that.

11
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,360
No. Look, I know that we've
talked about this a thousand times,

12
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,880
and we agreed that going to
London was the right thing to do.

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,560
But in my heart...
this feels wrong.

14
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,000
- Don't go, Jack.
- You mean don't go at all?

15
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,320
Well, what...
what about my internship?

16
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,960
Believe me, I know... I know what an
incredible opportunity this is for you.

17
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,960
- For us, Kate.
- Right, for us.

18
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,280
But I'm afraid that if you
get on that plane... Look.

19
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,440
We're at the airport. Nobody ever
thinks clearly at the airport.

20
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,120
So we should just trust
the decision we already made.

21
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,680
You've been accepted to one of the
best law schools in the country.

22
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:06,200
I've got this internship at Barclay's
Bank. We have a great plan, honey.

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,160
You wanna do something
great, Jack?

24
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,840
Let's flush the plan. Let's
start our lives right now, today.

25
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,240
I mean, I have no idea what
this life is gonna look like,

26
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,320
but I know that it has the both
of us in it, and I choose us.

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,880
The plan doesn't
make us great, Jack.

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,080
What we have together,
that's what makes us great.

29
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,520
- I love you, Kate.
- I love you too. I do.

30
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,120
And one year in London
is not gonna change that.

31
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,640
A hundred years
couldn't change that.

32
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,720
Experts are predicting
a mild rally in the bond market.

33
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,440
- Last night was incredible.
- Huh?

34
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,600
I said, last night was great.

35
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,120
You are an amazing lover.

36
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,280
Thanks.
You're not bad yourself.

37
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,720
- I wanna see you again.
- I'd like that too.

38
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,840
- Tonight.
- It's Christmas eve, Jack.

39
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,240
So? I'll pour eggnog over you.

40
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,840
I have to go visit
my parents out in Jersey.

41
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,680
Jersey? Do you have any idea
what the traffic's gonna be like?

42
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,160
That's why I'm taking the train.

43
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,320
It was nice meeting you, Jack.

44
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,760
# Sempre un amabile #

45
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,240
# Leggiadro viso #

46
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,840
# Inpianto o in riso #

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,320

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,000

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,600

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,640
# Edipensier #

52
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,600
# Edipensier #

53
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,760
# No #

54
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,760
Mrs. Peterson.
Hello, Jack.

55
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,120
You don't have to stop singing on my
account. Oh, it's because I'm shy, Betty.

56
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:09,200
So, when are you gonna leave that old
corpse, Mr. Peterson, and run away with me?

57
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,560
You know you could never
satisfy me the way he does.

58
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,800
Ah.

59
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,840
Merry Christmas,
Mr. Campbell.

60
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,960
How'd you make out
this year, Tony?

61
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,480
About four grand, and a bottle
of 25-year-old Scotch from 9D.

62
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,520
I'm putting it all in
commercial paper like you said.

63
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,800
Good, but just until
the deutsche mark turns.

64
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,320
- Thank you, Mr. Campbell.
- All right.

65
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,920
- Good morning, Joe.
- Merry Christmas, sir.

66
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,200
Campbell wants these
available. Thanks, Adelle.

67
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,120
Better you than me.

68
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,360
If Med Tech shares fall
any lower than 43,

69
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,280
we're in trouble
with the stock valuations.

70
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,960
So for God's sake, please watch what
you say to your institutional customers.

71
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,240
We still have almost a full day of trading
before zero hour, and I don't want any trouble.

72
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,120
A penny for
your thoughts, Alan.

73
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,280
Hmm? Oh, God, I'm sorry.

74
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,160
Jack, I was thinking about,
you know, Dee and the kids.

75
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,400
I promised I'd be home for
dinner. It's Christmas eve, Jack.

76
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,840
Oh, is that tonight?

77
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,000
You think I like being
here on Christmas eve, Alan?

78
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,280
No. Well, maybe.

79
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,680
Okay.

80
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,920
Okay, maybe I do have a touch of
tunnel vision this holiday season.

81
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,160
But in two days
we're going to announce...

82
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,280
one of the largest mergers
in U.S. corporate history.

83
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,040
When a deal like this turns up, you get
on it and you ride it till it's over.

84
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,680
You don't ask it for a vacation.

85
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,720
December 26. After that there'll be
so much money floating around here,

86
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,680
it'll be like Christmas
every day.

87
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,960
December 26, people. If you'd like to
celebrate that day, you all have my blessing.

88
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,960
- You're right. I'm sorry.
- I don't want you to be sorry. I want you to be excited.

89
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,600
I want my gift to you to be the first
gift you open this year. You know why?

90
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,280
Because my gift comes
with ten zeroes.

91
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,120
You're right.
I'm focused. I'm there.

92
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,920
Good man. Everybody, turn to
page 12 in your prospectus.

93
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,600
You have six messages. Two of them
are imperative. Whoa. I'm going home.

94
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,640
I'm not even here now. Good night.
Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.

95
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,480
It's only 8:30. I'm disappointed.
Got some last-minute shopping to do?

96
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,480
You too? This holiday's about giving. I'm
giving everything I've got to this deal.

97
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,640
- So in a way, I'm more Christmassy than anybody.
- You're my role model, Jack.

98
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,000
- Oh, and Oxford called.
- Ooh, my suits are ready.

99
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,240
Care for a Lifesaver?

100
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,440
- No, thank you.
- Help yourself.

101
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:30,080
Kate Reynolds. Her assistant said you
could reach her at home after 8:00.

102
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,560
Kate Reynolds was
my girlfriend in college.

103
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,600
- I almost married her.
- You?

104
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,920
- Married?
- Almost married.

105
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,640
- And almost a broker at E.F. Hutton.
- Excuse me?

106
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,840
She didn't want me to go to London.

107
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,600
We're standing at the airport saying
good-bye, and she asked me to stay.

108
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,320
So you left her.

109
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,240
- Wasn't easy.
- Oh, stop it. I'm getting all weepy.

110
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,320
I took the road
less traveled, Adelle.

111
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,680
And look where it took ya. I'm
gonna get this gal on the phone.

112
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,360
Nope. You almost married this woman.

113
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,360
You're not even curious
why she called?

114
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,600
She's probably just having
a fit of nostalgia.

115
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,920
Lonely Christmas eve. Call the one that
got away. Why call her back and mislead her?

116
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,320
This happened
a very, very long time ago.

117
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,080
8:35 on Christmas eve.

118
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,240
Jack Campbell still
at his desk.

119
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,440
Now there's
a Hallmark moment for you.

120
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,400
Peter, I don't see you
rushing home to trim the tree.

121
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:33,080
That's because I'm a heartless
bastard who only cares about money.

122
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,520
Well, you know what?
God love you for that.

123
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,640
Got a call
from Terry Haight.

124
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,080
Bob Thomas is nervous.

125
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,560
That'll happen when you're about to
spend $130 billion on some aspirin.

126
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,280
Somebody's gotta
nurse him through this.

127
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,560
Why are you staring
at my breasts, Peter?

128
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,480
- I need you, tiger.
- Where is he?

129
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,760
- Aspen.
- Call Aunt Irma and tell her I won't be able to make it.

130
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,480
You're a credit
to capitalism, Jack.

131
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,400
Hey, Peter, let me
ask you a question.

132
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,640
An old girlfriend calls you out
of the blue on Christmas eve.

133
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,240
- What do you do?
- You suddenly having trouble getting dates?

134
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,400
- Yeah.
- Leave it in the past.

135
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,520
Old flames are like
old tax returns...

136
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,600
put 'em in the file cabinet for three
years, and then you cut 'em loose.

137
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,320
I'll leave from my office
tomorrow in the afternoon.

138
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,480
Call the group. Schedule an
emergency strategy session for noon.

139
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,320
That'll be a nice
little holiday treat.

140
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,400
- Good night, Frank.
- Hey, Mr. Campbell.

141
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,160
Why didn't you call down?
I would have had Joe get your ride.

142
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,600
I'm thinking I'll walk tonight.
It's a nice night for it.

143
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,640
I'll send your car home
for you. That'll be fine.

144
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,160
- And Merry Christmas to you, sir.
- To you too.

145
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,760
- Eggnog?
- Yeah, dairy case. Five dollar.

146
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,720
Okay.

147
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,600
Hey, yo. Y'all do the lotto here,
right? Y'all do the lotto here?

148
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,120
Yeah. Cool. 'Cause I got a
winner, baby. I got a winner.

149
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,480
Certified, good as gold. I know lotto keep
a lot of brothers down, but not Cash Money.

150
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,920
Don't do me none, son,
'cause I'd be like...

151
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,880
Bang on the lottery! You know
what I mean? It's all good.

152
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,080
Relax, son. Relax. I got you
four numbers. Check it. Bust it.

153
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,200
6, 14, 16, 49.
That's a winner, son.

154
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,080
$238, B.
Cheddar coming.

155
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,840
- Give me my money.
- I'm sorry. Your ticket bad. You draw in the lines.

156
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,800
- What are you talking about, B.?
- You draw in the lines with a pencil.
I know about this.

157
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,480
- Yo, buster, check the ticket, son.
- No, you get out.

158
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,440
Yo, you ain't even looked at the ticket.
You looking at me, son. Check the ticket.

159
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,200
You get out now! You take
the ticket somewhere else!

160
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,400
Next customer in line!

161
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,520
You get out or I call 9-1-1.

162
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,240
Oh, my God!

163
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,480
Check the ticket, stupid.

164
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,720
Look at the ticket. Shit, now
I'm gonna make you call God.

165
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,280
That's my word. You best check that
ticket, fool! Let me see the ticket.

166
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,640
Was I talking to you?

167
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,880
Maybe I'll buy it from you.
You know, make a little business deal.

168
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,760
Stupid-ass white boy in $2,000 suit gets
capped trying to be a hero. News at 11:00.

169
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:24,480
That's what you wanna see? You wanna see
Cash up in here? You want me to set it, son?

170
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,280
Do you wanna die?

171
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,320
Do you want to die?

172
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,640
No.

173
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,360
Look, I'm talking about
a business deal.

174
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,200
Okay? I buy the ticket
from you for $200.

175
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,920
I take it to a store where the guy behind
the counter doesn't have a death wish.

176
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,720
I just made myself
a quick $38.

177
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,160
Like I said, it's...

178
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,360
it's just a business deal.

179
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,960
All right. Yeah.

180
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,880
All right.

181
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,480
You blew it, B.
You blew it.

182
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,320
The ticket was real.
Damn, you had your chance too.

183
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,360
Come on, Jack.
Let's get out of here.

184
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,720
How'd you know my name
was Jack?

185
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,920
I call all you guys Jack.

186
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,040
Here. Nice doing
business with ya.

187
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,000
Hey. Hey, um...

188
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,080
What do you want to carry
that gun around for anyway?

189
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,440
You're just gonna wind up
doing something you regret.

190
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,680
You're talking to the wrong
person about regrets, Jack.

191
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,080
I mean, there must be programs
out there and, um, opportunities.

192
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,480
Wait a minute. Are you
actually trying to save me?

193
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,400
This is bananas.

194
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,360
This man thinks
I need to be saved, yo!

195
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,280
Well, everybody needs something.

196
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,840
Yeah? Well, what
do you need, Jack?

197
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,560
- Me?
- You just said, everybody needs something.

198
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,720
I got everything I need.

199
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,080
Wow. It must be great being you.

200
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,640
I'm not saying that you'd be able to do it
without some hard work, some honest hard work,

201
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,960
and possibly some medicine.

202
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,280
You know, I'm gonna
really enjoy this.

203
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,320
You just remember that
you did this, Jack, okay?

204
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,840
You brought this on yourself.

205
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,280
Merry Christmas.

206
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,440
Mmm, ten more minutes, Jack.

207
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,120
It's Christmas.

208
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,760
# Jingle bells Santa smells
Rudolph laid an egg #

209
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,360
Never mind.

210
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,080
- Who's here?
- Rise and shine.

211
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,920
Don't you think
we should open some presents?

212
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,360
- I think you should give Mama five more minutes in bed.
- Come on, Dad. Get up.

213
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,960
- Can we do that?
- Yea! It's Christmas!

214
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:57,600
- It's Christmas!
- Look, your sister's jumping on the bed.

215
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,040
What is this dog doing on the bed?
He needs to get off the bed.

216
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,360
- Did Santa come?
- I don't know. We'll have to go see.

217
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,920
- Let's go see the presents.
- You wanna get some presents?

218
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,960
Mommy just needs to wake up.

219
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,040
Jack. Strong coffee.

220
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,600
Oh, Jack.
Merry Christmas, dear.

221
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,720
Lorraine. Ed.

222
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,320
Hey, Jack, you old bird dog.
Merry Christmas to ya.

223
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,760
Talk to him. One day a year
away from the Ponderosa.

224
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,480
- I don't think that's asking too much.
- This is who I am.

225
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,720
Tell her, Jack, for God's sake. You're
the only one around here that gets me.

226
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,360
- I need some eggnog.
- 'Course you do, sweet thing.
It's almost 8:00 in the morning.

227
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,040
- Excuse me.
- Where you going, Jack?

228
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,560
- Josh, Annie, giddyup!
- Where's my car? Where's my Ferrari?

229
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,480
- What?
- Where's my Ferrari?

230
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,760
What the hell are you talking... What's
he talking about? You got a Ferrari?

231
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,200
Let me borrow your car and then
I promise I'll have it returned.

232
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,560
My Caddy?
Drive your own damn car.

233
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,960
Oh, just let him borrow your
precious Cadillac, for God sakes.

234
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,440
There's a perfectly good minivan
sitting out there in the driveway. Here.

235
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,000
What the hell's wrong
with him anyway?

236
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,520
- Tony, thank God!
- Sorry, pal. Entrance is for residents and guests only.

237
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,520
What? What are
you talking about?

238
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,840
Jack Campbell, penthouse "C."
What's the matter with you?

239
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,960
Mrs. Peterson, I think there's
something wrong with our man Tony here.

240
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,920
Who is this man?

241
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,280
Oh, come on. What is going
on with you two this morning?

242
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:00,560
Is this like a, uh...
a Christmas joke?

243
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,760
"Who is this man?" Well, we're on
the co-op board together, Betty.

244
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,040
And we fought side by side
for garbage disposals.

245
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,280
And every morning we exchange
quasi-sexual witty banter. Ok?

246
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,840
Shall I call the cops?
I'm gonna call the cops.

247
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,320
No, I'm gonna call the cops!
You're scaring me.

248
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,080
- No, no, no, no.
- Thank you for not calling the cops.

249
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,720
Now, I'm going upstairs, I'm gonna
get some sleep. Then I'll be fine.

250
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,280
Sleep you shall. Noblesse oblige
isn't dead. Not yet anyway.

251
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,400
Let's, um... Let's get you some help. Surely
there's a shelter somewhere in this city.

252
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,400
A shelter?

253
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,400
Hey, hey, are you
smacked out of your head?

254
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,720
I'm the richest man in this building!
I've got twice the square footage you have!

255
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,320
- And I'm going upstairs.
- Take a walk, pal.

256
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,000
Oh, not cool.
Not cool!

257
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,480
You wanna get cute?
Get cute.

258
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,520
I'm gonna go to my office. I'm gonna file
a complaint to the manager of the building.

259
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:51,200
I'm gonna have you fired, Tony. And, Mrs.
Peterson, you're on notice with the co-op board!

260
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,880
So you better just stop whatever
this is that you're doing!

261
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,920
Oh, come on!

262
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:18,560
Frank, you won't believe what's been
happening to me. Is Adelle here yet?

263
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,480
- Hold it right there.
- Where's Mintz?

264
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,560
The building is closed, pal.
You have to come back tomorrow.

265
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:28,040
Frank, why do I feel the need to remind
you that I'm Jack Campbell, President?

266
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:32,760
I don't care who you are. It's Christmas,
and like I told you, the building is closed.

267
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,800
I don't think
you heard me correctly.

268
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,400
I'm Jack Campbell.

269
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,600
Jack Campbell!

270
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,320
President!

271
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,120
Have a nice holiday, man.

272
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,760
- That's my car!
- Hi, Jack.

273
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,440
- You stole my car.
- I know this whole thing is really bizarre to you...

274
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,480
and you're feeling
quite shocked, but just hop in.

275
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:23,040
I'll explain everything
to you, okay?

276
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,960
Come on.

277
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,880
Come on.

278
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:37,480
You're probably gonna wanna
buckle up, Jack. This thing moves.

279
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,400
- What's happening to me?
- Breathe into the bag, Jack.

280
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,280
This kind of thing makes a lot of guys
have to throw up. I seen it happen before.

281
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,720
So if you feel the urge, you roll
down the window and do it out there.

282
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,680
Try not to get
so worked up, Jack.

283
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,600
After all, you brought
this on yourself.

284
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,720
Brought what on myself?
I didn't do anything!

285
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,080
"I got everything I need."
That sound familiar?

286
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,360
You mean 'cause you thought I was
cocky, I'm now on a permanent acid trip?

287
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,080
Bag yourself, Jack.

288
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,120
Oh, my God! Ah!

289
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,760
The way you intervened in that store last
night, you did a good thing there, Jack.

290
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,520
I mean, it was incredibly impressive
all the way across the board...

291
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,200
to the upper echelons
of the organization.

292
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,760
Please just tell me what's
happening to me in plain English...

293
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,520
without the mumbo-jumbo.

294
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,000
- This is a glimpse, Jack.
- A glimpse?

295
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,440
A glimpse of what?

296
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,320
You're gonna have to figure that out
for yourself and you got plenty of time.

297
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,040
- How much time?
- As much time as it takes,

298
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,160
which in your case is probably
gonna be considerable.

299
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,720
Okay, look, look. I-I-I just
want my life back, okay?

300
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,040
Now, what's it gonna take?
You wanna talk turkey?

301
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,680
Let's talk turkey.
How much money?

302
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:57,240
- It doesn't work like that, and I can't tell you why.
- Why not?

303
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,160
Because you have to figure
this thing out for yourself.

304
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,360
Are you listening to me? Figure it
out, figure it out. Figure out what?

305
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,560
- Let it come to you, man.
- I don't have time for this right now.

306
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,520
- I'm in the middle of a deal.
- Well, you're working on a new deal now, baby.

307
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,360
What's this?
Open it.

308
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,000
What is it,
some kind of a signal?

309
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,240
Will you come
whenever I ring it?

310
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,240
Now you gotta
get out of the car, Jack.

311
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,880
But what do I do? I'm sorry. I
can't spend any more time with you.

312
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,480
- I got some other business I gotta take care of.
- No, y-y-you did this to me.

313
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,640
You can't just leave me like this.

314
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,400
Okay. Look, you wanna get some air?
Let's get outside, get some air.

315
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,320
We'll walk and I'll explain
everything to you, okay?

316
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,920
- Thanks, man.
- Sure.

317
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,880
Excuse me. Do you know
where Merrison Street is?

318
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Jeannie.

319
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,720
- I found Jack.
- Oh, there you are, stranger.

320
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,160
Where you been?

321
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,160
You look terrible.
Truth is, I expected you.

322
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,680
Kate called and asked
if I knew where you were, so...

323
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,240
Oh, I put the Barcalounger in the center
of the room. It's throwing everybody off.

324
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,160
What do you think?

325
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,160
It's a great room.
Great room.

326
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,000
You and me, buddy,
we know how to live, huh?

327
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,880
Come on.

328
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,720
Come on, Jack.
Come on...

329
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,280
Come on, buddy.
Take your seat.

330
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,640
Are you okay?

331
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,400
I mean, you take off Christmas morning and
you don't tell anyone where you're going.

332
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,560
- We're friends?
- Talk to me.

333
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,320
I'm having kind of a bad day.

334
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,800
You know, I read somewhere that the
suicide rate doubles during the holiday.

335
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,600
What am I saying that for?
You don't wanna hear that. Come on.

336
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,240
Is it...
Is it trouble at work?

337
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,400
I... I don't think so.

338
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,360
Well, it's not Kate, is it?

339
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,720
You see, huh? It's like we're
inside each other's heads.

340
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,760
Kate's my wife.

341
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,960
Just keep saying it over and over again,
Jack, like a mantra. Keep saying it.

342
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,040
Look, you know,
you fit the profile exactly...

343
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,320
in your 30s, house, kids,
financial responsibilities.

344
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,600
You start thinking this
isn't the life I dreamt about.

345
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,320
Where's the romance,
you know?

346
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,760
Where's the joie de vivre?

347
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,000
Suddenly every lingerie ad
in the Newark Star-Ledger...

348
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,560
represents a life
that you can't have.

349
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,680
It's just two kids, right?

350
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,040
Come on. Come on.

351
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:13,680
All right, sometimes it feels like you
gave up the whole world. I know that.

352
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:17,000
But look what you got.
Look at that: four bedrooms,

353
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,040
two-and-a-half baths,
a partially finished basement.

354
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:23,000
And good kids.
Look. You know what?

355
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,360
You probably don't wanna
hear this right now.

356
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:29,080
But remember last summer when I almost had
that thing with Arnie, Jr. 's speech therapist?

357
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,960
You remember what
you said to me?

358
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,720
You said, "Don't screw up
the best thing in your life...

359
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,560
just because you're a little
unsure about who you are."

360
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,520
Okay?

361
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,560
Go get 'em, tiger.

362
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,360
Could you hold on a second?

363
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,240
Um, never mind because...
because he just walked in.

364
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,440
Thank you. Thank you.

365
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:46,040
Do you... have any idea
what you put us through today?

366
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,520
You walk out of here
at 7:30 in the morning.

367
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:53,320
You don't tell me where you're
going, or even that you're going.

368
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,720
And I don't see you
till hours later?

369
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,080
I called all of our friends. I had
the state troopers looking for you.

370
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,120
I was on the phone with the
hospital, for God's sakes.

371
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:06,800
What kind of man leaves his family on Christmas
morning without a word about where he's going?

372
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,000
- What kind of a man does that, Jack?
- I don't know.

373
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:13,160
Could you... Could you please
stop yelling at me?

374
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,600
- Where were you?
- I was in the city.

375
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,880
The city?
New York City?

376
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,120
- Yeah.
- Why?

377
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,280
- Because that's where I live.
- Don't start, Jack. Don't.

378
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,680
Look, you don't understand.

379
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,840
I... I... I woke up
this morning here.

380
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,560
And this is very strange
because...

381
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,480
this isn't my house.

382
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,480
And those aren't my kids.
I'm not Dad.

383
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,880
I- I-I'm not a dad.
You're not my wife.

384
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,280
You know what, Jack.
It's not funny this time...

385
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,200
because I am really mad.

386
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,680
I mean, really mad.
I mean it.

387
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,080
I don't even...

388
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,120
What...

389
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,280
What's that?

390
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,080
I like it.
Thanks, Dad.

391
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,560
That's mine. Hey,
I need that back.

392
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,800
She took my bell.

393
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,280
You missed the whole thing...

394
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,000
the pancakes and the presents.

395
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,440
You spent six hours putting
that bike together for Annie,

396
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,960
and then you didn't even get to see
the look on her face when she opened it.

397
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,160
You missed Christmas, Jack.

398
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,640
I'm sorry.

399
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,600
You know, we don't even
have enough time for this.

400
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,800
And at least you're okay.
I'm okay, we're okay.

401
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:54,920
But you've gotta get dressed for the
Thompson party. And you are not wearing that.

402
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,120
I don't care how hilarious
you think it is.

403
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,600
Party? No, I'm not
going to a party.

404
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,880
You look forward to this party all
year. What is it with you today?

405
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Believe me, Kate. I really don't
think that going to a party...

406
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,280
is the right move for me
at the present time.

407
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:12,360
Okay, fine. You know what? Then
you just do whatever you wanna do.

408
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:16,280
- What are you doing?
- Telling my mother she doesn't
have to stay with the kids.

409
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,000
- Why not?
- Because you'll be here.

410
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,600
I'll be ready in ten minutes.

411
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,800
This is... This is
just subpar.

412
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,240
# Oh, the weather outside
is frightful #

413
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,840
Lance, here you go.

414
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,920
Excuse me.

415
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:12,880
# Let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow #

416
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,880
# It doesn't show
signs of stopping ##

417
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,960
- Kate. Jack.
- Evelyn.

418
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,920
Come in. Hey, everybody,
Kate and Jack are here.

419
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,920
- Hey!
- Jeannie.

420
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,040
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

421
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,120
Jack, Merry Christmas.

422
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:32,080
Whoops.
Here.

423
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,040
- So, like the dress?
- Oh, it's lovely.

424
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,560
I thought I saw you notice
it at the kids' recital.

425
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,800
It's lovely.
It's lovely.

426
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,760
There he is.

427
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,920
- Hey, Jack. Happy holidays, man.
- Yeah.

428
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,400
Jack, come on over.

429
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,640
Hey, Jack.
Cheers, baby.

430
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,680
- You guys see Van Horn last night?
- Thirty-two points.

431
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,040
- That kid's gonna take the Nets to the championship.
- The Nets? Are you kidding?

432
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,960
They suck.

433
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,640
But they're due.
They're certainly due.

434
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,440
So, tomorrow's
the big day, Jackie.

435
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,200
Okay. Why?

436
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,760
My triple bypass.

437
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,320
I'm going under the knife
tomorrow. I told you that, right?

438
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,240
- Triple bypass.
- Yeah.

439
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,680
You really think you should
be eating all that?

440
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,600
Figure I'm going in
for a cleaning tomorrow.

441
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,760
Might as well load up on the
fried stuff tonight, right?

442
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,240
That's good thinking, Bill.
Have another drink.

443
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:45,480
Some fried pork, mashed potatoes.
He'll be dead by morning.

444
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,440
- How 'bout a cigar, Jack?
- Oh, no, thank you. I'm cutting down.

445
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:51,240
- Come on. They're American made, not Cuban.
- Oh, really?

446
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,840
Come on.

447
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,320
- Very nice.
- I thought you'd like 'em.

448
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,440
Superb.

449
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,080
- How 'bout you, Arnie?
- I'm all right. Thanks.

450
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,120
- Finger food?
- No, thank you. I'm fine.

451
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,760
Come on. Soon as I put 'em
down, you're gonna grab a couple.

452
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,800
- You always do.
- No, I'm okay.

453
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,480
Let me. They will melt
in your mouth.

454
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,040
Yeah.

455
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:26,880
- Good?
- Fabulous.

456
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,440
At the end of this whole thing, she
made me this hand-embroidered sweater.

457
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,440
- It was really lovely.
- How nice.

458
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,840
So I'm slipping it on and I notice that
she's misspelled the word "lawyers."

459
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,520
I spent the entire
day walking around...

460
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:44,320
with a sweater that said,
"Nonprofit layers do it for free."

461
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,600
So you're a lawyer?

462
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,480
A nonprofit lawyer?

463
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,720
Probono.

464
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:59,040
- You don't get paid at all? Nobody makes a dime?
- Jack?

465
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,880
"Anyhoo..."

466
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:17,520
I better go wake my mom.
There you go.

467
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,440
Uh, I don't think so.

468
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,480
- She's your dog, Jack.
- No, she's not.

469
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,840
You're right.
She's the kids' dog.

470
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,480
Maybe we should go wake Josh
and make him walk her.

471
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:40,200
If you take a dump sometime in this century,
then we could go home where it's warm.

472
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,480
If I can even remember
how to get home.

473
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,760
You remember,
don't you, girl?

474
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,960
Hello?

475
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:00,200
# Am I hard enough
Am I rough enough #

476
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,200
# Am I rich enough #

477
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,320
Hello?
# I'm not too blind #

478
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:07,320
# To see #

479
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,120
- Hey!
- What?

480
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,000
Oh. That baby's crying.

481
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,000
And?

482
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,640
Don't give me that look, Jack.
Tuesday's your day and you know it.

483
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,000
And listen, try and get Josh
to day care on time, okay?

484
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:30,080
# You're a pretty, pretty
pretty, pretty #

485
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,560
# Such a pretty girl ##

486
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,840
All right.

487
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,240
Holy Mother of God!

488
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,000
You're not really
my dad, are you?

489
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,920
No, I'm not.

490
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,640
I work on Wall Street, you
know, with the big buildings.

491
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,080
I live in an apartment
with a doorman.

492
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,760
And I can buy
almost anything I want.

493
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,440
This isn't my life.
It's just a glimpse.

494
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,640
Where's my real dad?

495
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,400
I don't know.
But don't worry.

496
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,040
He loves you, and I'm sure
he'll be back very soon.

497
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,840
What are you doing?

498
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,880
They did a pretty good job.

499
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,360
Who did?

500
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,280
The aliens
in the mother ship.

501
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,200
You look just like him.

502
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,040
Oh, thanks.

503
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,520
Slightly better looking
though, right?

504
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,040
Oh, no, you're not gonna
start crying, are you?

505
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:04,160
I don't think I could
really deal with that right now.

506
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,240
Do you like kids?

507
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,360
On a case by case basis.

508
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,040
Do you know how
to make chocolate milk?

509
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,360
I... I think I could
figure it out.

510
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,880
Promise you won't kidnap
me and my brother...

511
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,200
and plant stuff in our brains?

512
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,880
Sure.

513
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,120
Welcome to Earth.

514
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,720
# We're going to the zoo
zoo, zoo #

515
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,080
# Look at all the crocodiles
swimming in the... ##

516
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:52,040
This is where babies go when
their parents are at work.

517
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,840
Check.

518
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,960
Just push the red button.

519
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,440
Okay.

520
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,800
Do I get a receipt or something?

521
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:37,280
I have winter camping till 4:00
and ballet class until 5:30.

522
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,920
- 5:30. Okay.
- And try not to be late...

523
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:44,240
- 'cause kids don't like to be the
last one picked up.
- Got it. Good tip.

524
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,160
- Bye.
- Bye.

525
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:53,120
- Hey, Annie. Where do I go now?
- Big Ed's.

526
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:56,960
Big Ed's Tires?
Why?

527
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,720
- 'Cause you work there.
- You mean I sell tires.

528
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:05,800
That's what I do.
I'm a tire salesman.

529
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,640
Good Lord!

530
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,680
- Morning, Jack.
- Hi.

531
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:50,200
- Good morning, Jack.
- Hi.

532
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,240
Hey, Jack.

533
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,560
Jack, my boy.

534
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,640
Hey, guess who I played
bridge with two nights ago.

535
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,960
Hell, you'll never guess.

536
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:13,280
One Sydney Potter. That's Sydney
Potter, C.E.O., Buy Rite Transport.

537
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,320
Only the third biggest
trucking outfit in the state.

538
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:19,800
"Anyhoo," he's looking
for a new parts supplier.

539
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,440
We can handle volume
like that, now can't we, Jack?

540
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,320
I'm gonna have to
get back to you on that, Ed.

541
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,760
Right on.

542
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,640
Right on.

543
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:42,440
Excuse me. Uh, do I... do I have a
private office somewhere in the building?

544
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:46,160
Sure, Jack.

545
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,080
Where is it?

546
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,520
Oh, uh, it's...

547
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,520
it's right back...
right back there.

548
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,240
Thank you.

549
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,800
Oh, no.

550
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,720
You must've needed this
every day.

551
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,040
What are you smiling about?

552
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,360
Eighty-eight?

553
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:25,160
I was in London in 1988.

554
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,280
You never went to London.

555
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:39,000
Jack, you're needed in mag
wheels. Customer waiting.

556
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:48,640
I was the number one junior sales
associate for E.F. Hutton in 1988.

557
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:51,160
- Did you know that?
- Uh, no. No, I didn't.

558
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,080
That's great.

559
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,640
That's the kind of thing you
could really build on, you know?

560
00:46:55,720 --> 00:47:00,280
- Uh-huh. Yeah.
- I mean, sales has always been a feeder for M&A. Always.

561
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,120
Uh-huh.

562
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:05,600
Well, look, here we are.
The mag wheels. Mag wheels.

563
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,560
Oh. So.

564
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,320
Hey, Jack, um,
are you sure you're okay?

565
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,880
Well, I'm just a little confused
right now about why I work here.

566
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,160
Uh...

567
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:20,560
I just started here
last Tuesday, so...

568
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,160
The closing tip was
a mildly bullish plus-76.

569
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:33,560
Much of the market's action today was
fueled by the latest round of merger mania...

570
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:35,400
to hit Wall Street...

571
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,640
when Global Health Systems and Med Tech
Pharmaceutical announced their intentions...

572
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:43,160
to join forces in a massive
$122 billion stock swap deal,

573
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:45,400
the largest ever
in the health care industry.

574
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:48,160
When asked about the possible
anti-competitive implications,

575
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,880
Global chairman Bob Thomas
referred reporters...

576
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:55,080
to P.K. Lassiter & Company president
Alan Mintz, the architect behind the deal.

577
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:59,080
- That's my deal!
- Ironically, Mintz first met Thomas at a Lamaze class.

578
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,640
- What?
- While coaching their pregnant
wives, Mintz and Thomas...

579
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:04,760
struck up a dialog, and two months
later, the deal with Med Tech was born.

580
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,720
He wasn't the architect!
I'm the architect!

581
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:12,440
Labor department officials announced today
that 275,000 new jobs have been created.

582
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:15,400
The kids are asleep.

583
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,680
The kids, hon.
Honey.

584
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:22,520
Sweetheart, I said
the kids are asleep.

585
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:26,520
That's just great. Those little
monkeys can be a real handful.

586
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,360
Hey, I was watching that.

587
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,240
Not tonight.

588
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,800
Please leave
my socks alone.

589
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,120
Wait.

590
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,920
- You want me.
- That is the general idea, yeah.

591
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,760
Oh, well, maybe we should
grab a bottle of wine first.

592
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,760
Kind of break the ice.

593
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:00,880
Yeah, that's very funny.
Look, it's 10:30.

594
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,600
By 11:00 you're gonna be
snoring like a monster,

595
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,640
but that's very sweet.

596
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:08,080
I'll remember that
for next time.

597
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,880
Whatever you say...
honey.

598
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,920
Yeah.

599
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,080
Oh, God, you're beautiful.

600
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:33,080
Thanks, Jack.

601
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,440
No, I'm serious.

602
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,360
You're really stunning.

603
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,640
This is good stuff.
I want you to keep this up.

604
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:44,520
You were always a very pretty girl in
college. There's no question about that.

605
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,240
But this...

606
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:52,920
You've really grown
into a beautiful woman.

607
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,680
How can you do that?

608
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,840
What?

609
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:02,960
Look at me like you haven't seen
me every day for the last 13 years.

610
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:10,160
Okay, wait. Don't move.
Don't look.

611
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,320
Stay right there.

612
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:14,240
I got something.

613
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:43,120
# The world was on fire #

614
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,680
# No one could save me
but you #

615
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,640
Good night, sweetheart.

616
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,160
# Strange what desire #

617
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:54,360
# Will make foolish people do ##

618
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,640
Okay, we're almost
out of here.

619
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,480
Mary Janes, Mommy.
You promised.

620
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:40,520
That's right. I did
promise. Okay. All right.

621
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:43,080
We're gonna stop at the
kids' shoe department first,

622
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:46,560
and then I gotta pick up my
watch from the battery store.

623
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,440
Then I'm gonna go
to the linen store.

624
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,600
Why don't we go
to all the stores?

625
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,640
Every single store in this
god forsaken shopping mall.

626
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,600
Wouldn't that be exciting?

627
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:59,800
You know what?
Why don't I take the kids,

628
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,640
and you just stay here and hang
out in the men's department?

629
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:06,080
Come on, hon.

630
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:25,360
It's perfect for your frame.

631
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:27,840
Why don't you try it on?

632
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:35,200
I might want to take an
inch out of the back. Okay.

633
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,120
Lengthen the sleeve.

634
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:42,880
You look amazing in that suit.

635
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:48,120
I mean, really... wow!

636
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:51,440
Off the charts, great.

637
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,680
It's an unbelievable thing.

638
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:57,480
Wearing this suit actually makes
me feel like a better person.

639
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,520
I'm gonna buy it.

640
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:11,040
It's $2,400.

641
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:14,040
Are you out of your mind?
Come on, let's go.

642
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:17,360
- She got those shoes.
- Those shoes were $25.

643
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,560
Come on.
Take it off, all right?

644
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:22,400
We'll go to the food court and get
one of those funnel cakes you like.

645
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,520
Daddy's a crazy guy.

646
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,480
No.

647
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:30,320
No.

648
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:35,760
Do you have any idea
what my life is like?

649
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:40,320
- Excuse me?
- I wake up in the morning covered in dog saliva.

650
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:42,280
I drop the kids off,

651
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:44,960
spend eight hours
selling tires retail.

652
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,880
Retail, Kate.

653
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,360
I pick the kids up,
walk the dog,

654
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:53,280
which, by the way,
carries the added bonus...

655
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:57,200
of carting away
her monstrous crap.

656
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:00,360
I play with the kids,
take out the garbage,

657
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:02,320
get six hours of sleep
if I'm lucky.

658
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:04,240
Then everything starts
all over again.

659
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:05,920
So what's in it for me?

660
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:08,760
Wh-Where are my Mary Janes?

661
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:14,440
You know, it's sad to hear that your
life is such a disappointment to you.

662
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:17,600
I can't believe it isn't
a disappointment to you!

663
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:21,680
Jesus, Kate, I could have been a
thousand times the man I became.

664
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,320
I could have been one of
the richest... Forbes...

665
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:29,720
How could you do this to me? How could
you let me give up on my dreams like this?

666
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:33,520
Really, I want to know.

667
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:35,520
Who are you?

668
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:38,400
All right, look.
I'm sorry.

669
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,880
I'm sorry I was such
a saint before...

670
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:43,800
and I'm such a prick now!

671
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:46,040
But maybe I'm just not...

672
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:49,600
the same guy that I was
when we got married.

673
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:51,760
You know what?
Maybe you're not.

674
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:56,560
Because the Jack Campbell I married
would not need a $2,400 suit...

675
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,960
to feel better about his life.

676
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:02,280
But I'm telling you, if that's
what it's gonna take, then buy it.

677
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,840
Jesus! We'll take the money
out of the kids' college fund.

678
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:09,240
Forget it.
We'll get a funnel cake.

679
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:12,120
It'll be the highlight
of my week.

680
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:29,440
Listen, I'm really sorry
about that back in the store.

681
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,360
I don't want to fight with you.

682
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:35,920
I just sometimes wonder how
we ended up here, you know.

683
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:39,400
I mean, back in college,
d-did you see us here?

684
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:42,520
Life has thrown us a few
surprises. I'll give you that.

685
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:45,960
It really has, hasn't it?

686
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:49,560
Yeah. So, if you had to, what would
you say was the biggest surprise?

687
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:53,440
Just out of curiosity.
I'm just asking.

688
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:58,080
- Well, Annie, for one.
- Surprise, we're pregnant.

689
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,040
Yeah, that must have been.

690
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:04,040
I mean, that... that was.
That was a very unexpected moment.

691
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:08,280
- What are you gonna do?
- I think it turned out all right, don't you?

692
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,360
Yeah.
I really like Annie.

693
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,320
Well, good, Jack.
Maybe we'll keep her.

694
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,240
No, I love her.
I love Annie.

695
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:16,080
I'm just...

696
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:20,520
We had a lot of good times,
didn't we?

697
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:25,720
Do you remember the place on
Charles Street where we used to go?

698
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:28,040
Charles Street?

699
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:32,200
In the village?

700
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:34,400
When we were living
in Greenwich Village.

701
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:38,240
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Great times. Great place.

702
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:40,160
Why did we ever leave?

703
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:43,360
You can't really raise a kid
in an apartment in the village.

704
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:46,280
Then there was the whole trek out to
the hospital. That didn't help either.

705
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:52,840
You were great. I mean, surviving
the heart attack was one thing.

706
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:55,320
- You had a heart attack?
- Hey, Jack, stop that.

707
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:58,920
'Cause I am...
I'm still mad at you.

708
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,360
Who knows what would have happened
if you hadn't stepped in at the store?

709
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:06,160
That's why I work for Big Ed.

710
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,800
That's why I work
for Big Ed. Yeah.

711
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:16,480
So we had a baby,
Big Ed had a heart attack.

712
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:19,400
Bought that house, and I've
been working for him ever since.

713
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:22,160
Sayonara, Wall Street.

714
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:26,080
Our life in a nutshell.

715
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:28,680
If you want to
look at it that way.

716
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:31,200
How would you look at it?

717
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:36,680
A great success story.

718
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:44,920
What do you say, Jack? Show 'em how
to do it, baby. Jack, we need a strike.

719
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:49,720
- Damn!
- Jesus, Jack. What are you doing?

720
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:53,680
It's a league match. Where's your
follow through? Where's your stance?

721
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:56,800
You know what?
I'm doing the best I can.

722
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,040
It's okay, Jack.

723
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:01,240
Why am I so competitive
all the time?

724
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:04,480
You can still pick up that
spare. Crack 'em, Jack!

725
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:08,320
Here we go.
Hurt 'em.

726
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,480
You're Jack Campbell.
You're better than the sport.

727
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:14,960
You shot the rapids in Kanai.
You ran with the bulls in Pamplona.

728
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:17,760
You've jumped out of an airplane over
the Mojave Desert, for Christ's sake.

729
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:19,940
You can do this.
You can do this.

730
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:31,480
Yes! Victorious!

731
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,280
Huh? All right!

732
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:39,520
High five!

733
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:42,720
- You're up.
- Go get 'em.

734
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:54,480
Hi, Jack.

735
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:59,480
- Evelyn, right?
- Very funny.

736
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:02,320
I saw you on lane 20.
You got the flu or something?

737
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:04,400
Something like that, yeah.

738
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:07,120
Need a nurse?

739
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,040
Are you a nurse?

740
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:11,200
If that's what you want.

741
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:14,960
Hey, wait a minute.

742
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:17,280
Um, don't run away.

743
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,120
Are we...

744
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:23,200
Are we what, Jack?

745
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:25,120
Well...

746
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:28,080
Is there something
going on between us?

747
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:35,760
Are we finally being honest?

748
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:38,800
It would help me if we were.

749
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:40,880
Okay. You're right.

750
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,960
We've been dancing
around this for years.

751
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:47,600
Here goes.

752
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:51,240
When I get dressed for a party,
and I know you're gonna be there,

753
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:55,680
let's just say I don't go strapless
because my husband likes it.

754
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:59,280
I've got six sets of snow
tires piled up in my garage,

755
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:02,800
and I won't even drive
in the snow.

756
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:05,360
And our kids
just happen to be...

757
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:08,720
in the same ballet class
every year.

758
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:13,280
So, if you're asking whether
I'd like it to be more,

759
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:16,120
the answer's yes.

760
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:18,040
Kate would never have to know.

761
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:24,120
Do I have your number?

762
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:29,280
Steve's out of town
with the kids this weekend.

763
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:31,720
Why don't you just stop by?

764
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,840
Hey, Jack.
You're all flushed.

765
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:49,400
I feel good. Guess that
71 took a lot out of you.

766
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:53,400
No. I just saw
Evelyn Thompson.

767
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:55,360
She's relentless.

768
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:57,640
She wants to have
an affair with me.

769
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:02,200
- She said that?
- Pretty much.

770
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:06,080
What is it about you?

771
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:11,440
So... if you would write
her exact address down there.

772
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:14,680
You have a pen? Please. Whoa,
whoa, whoa. Hold on a second.

773
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:18,120
You're not actually thinking
about cheating on Kate?

774
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:21,360
Well, it wouldn't really
be cheating, Arnie.

775
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:25,320
It's complicated.

776
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:29,040
Maybe I haven't been as good a consigliere
as you've been to me, but hear me out on this.

777
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,560
A little flirtation is harmless,

778
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:34,080
but you're dealing
with fire here, man.

779
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:37,120
The Fidelity Bank and Trust
is a tough creditor.

780
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:40,400
You make a deposit somewhere
else, they close your account...

781
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,720
forever, all right?

782
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,720
Arnie, I don't want
your head to explode,

783
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:47,320
but I'm telling you,
those rules don't apply to me.

784
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:49,320
I-I'm not even...

785
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:52,560
I'm not talking about rules.
I'm talking about...

786
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:54,560
Y-You're...

787
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:58,040
There isn't a guy in Union County
who wouldn't give his left nut...

788
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:00,280
to be with Kate, all right?

789
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:03,640
She's amazing, and you're
gonna fuck it up.

790
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,720
Just think about that,
all right?

791
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:22,720
Hey, honey.
How was the game?

792
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:25,280
Long and boring
and generally pretty sad.

793
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:28,760
Arnie seemed to enjoy it.

794
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:31,160
Sort of.

795
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,600
Hey, where's that chocolate cake?

796
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:39,240
- Do you mean this chocolate cake?
- That's my piece.

797
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:43,320
I was saving it because I got nauseated by
that precooked mini-mall rotisserie chicken.

798
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:47,200
Mmm. Mmm.
It's good.

799
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:49,440
Give me that cake.

800
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:51,600
No way.

801
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:55,160
- Come on.
- I'm sorry.

802
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:57,080
It's too important to me.

803
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:11,720
I want that cake!

804
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:14,760
- You want this cake?
- I want it.

805
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:18,360
Thank you.

806
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:20,880
- It's good, right?
- Mm-hmm.

807
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,120
Oh, God!

808
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:34,400
Are the kids asleep?

809
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:53,200
- Say it to me, Jack.
- What?

810
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:55,320
You know what I like to hear.

811
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:58,000
I know, baby. I know
what you like to hear.

812
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:01,960
Tell me.
Tell me, tell me.

813
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:04,880
You're a bad girl, baby.
You make me so hot.

814
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,960
What?

815
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:09,960
Not it?

816
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:13,120
Nice, Jack.

817
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:17,320
- What?
- Sweeping me off my feet.

818
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:21,120
You make me hot.

819
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,480
What do you say, everyone?

820
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:06,760
- This is a little birthday party for Katie.
- Happy birthday, Katie.

821
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:09,360
Good to see you kids still
together. Hello, kids.

822
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:12,360
Happy birthday. Very exciting.
Evelyn, you look tremendous.

823
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:14,720
- Thank you.
- Look what happens when I do that.

824
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:16,720
- Jack? The man.
- Yes. Yes.

825
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:19,480
Do you have anything to say to your
lovely wife on the day of her birth?

826
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:22,680
- You happy she was born?
- Hey, hey! Today's your birthday?

827
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:25,520
- That's funny, Jack.
- You know what?

828
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:28,880
Wow, your birthday.
It's... You're my wife.

829
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,480
You are my wife.
Today is your birthday.

830
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:35,240
Well, actually, I do have one
thing that I want to say to you.

831
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:38,520
And God,
I hope you like it.

832
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:40,440
Bill?

833
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:47,640
- Oh, no.
- Yes. You hit it, Bill.

834
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:51,160
You wore that shirt last year,
by the way. Just so you know.

835
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,800
# Many guys
have come to you #

836
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:56,200
- # With a line that wasn't true #
- Oh!

837
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:58,560
# And you passed them by #

838
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:01,080
# Passed them by #

839
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:05,440
# Now you're in the centering
and their lines don't mean a thing #

840
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:08,680
# Why don't you let me try #

841
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:10,800
# Let me try #

842
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:14,840
# Now, I don't wear
a diamond ring #

843
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:19,400
# I don't even have
a song to sing #

844
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:23,920
# All I know is
la-la-la-la la-la-la-la-la #

845
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:28,080
# Means I love you #

846
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:33,680
# La-la-la-la
la-la-la-la-la #

847
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:38,000
# Means I love you #

848
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:44,560
Ahh!

849
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:46,480
Sweet.

850
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:53,600
# The things I am saying
are true-ooh-ooh #

851
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:57,800
# And the way
I explain it to you #

852
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:00,600
- Get down, Jack.
# Yes, to you #

853
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:03,280
# Listen to me
La-la-la-la #

854
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:06,120
# La-la-la-la-la means #

855
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:09,520
# I love you #

856
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:11,440
# Ohh #

857
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:14,880
# La-la-la-la
la-la-la-la-la #

858
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:18,960
# Means I love you ##

859
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:22,360
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

860
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:24,840
Yeah.

861
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:28,360
Yeah, Jack!

862
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:31,160
There's love in the air.

863
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:34,400
He loves her.
It's official. There's love.

864
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:05,040
Mmm. Come on,
it's time to get up, honey.

865
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:07,200
Go, go.

866
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:42,720
Good morning, Joshie.

867
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:50,280
Happy anniversary, honey.

868
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:54,120
Now, listen, before you do whatever
crazy stunt you've got planned,

869
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:56,680
I want you to open mine first.

870
01:08:58,280 --> 01:09:00,040
Maybe I should wait.

871
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:03,440
No! Come on! Come on,
come on, come on. Open it.

872
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:14,640
Zeena?

873
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:20,200
I found it at an outlet store.

874
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:24,280
Look, I know it's a knock off, but
I think it's gonna look great on you.

875
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:28,480
You...

876
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:30,880
Ah, enjoy it, sweetheart.

877
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:37,480
Uh...

878
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:41,320
Yeah, uh... You're probably
expecting something from me.

879
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:43,640
Um, here's the thing.

880
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:49,320
I hadn't really planned on giving
you your anniversary gift...

881
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:51,320
until tonight.

882
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:53,360
You know, anniversary's
good all day.

883
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:56,400
What are you talking about?
You can never wait all day.

884
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:59,200
You can't even wait till
it's light out. Come on!

885
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:02,720
I know. I know.
That's me. It's true.

886
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:06,080
And... But, um,

887
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:08,000
it's funny.

888
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:18,160
You forgot.

889
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:21,560
You actually forgot
our anniversary.

890
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:25,560
I'll fix it. I'll go out right
now and I'll get you something.

891
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:27,560
I'll make it right.

892
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:44,800
Let me know if there's enough
chocolate in there, sweetheart.

893
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:52,040
- Mm, not bad.
- Good.

894
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:53,960
I should have warned you.

895
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:57,840
Dad always does something really
special for the anniversary.

896
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:01,440
Like what? One year he
had a star named after her.

897
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:04,760
He had a star
named after her?

898
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:09,200
Well, that's nice, but
isn't that a little... corny?

899
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:11,920
Mom liked it.

900
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:15,840
Maybe there's a jewelry store at the mall. I
can pick her up a pair of earrings or something.

901
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:18,600
That's good, but...

902
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:20,840
you did forget
the anniversary.

903
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:24,040
That's right. That is a
major oversight. Okay, okay.

904
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:28,440
So, if I'm Kate, I can't
afford the finer things.

905
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:33,080
My husband's career is definitely
a crushing disappointment to me.

906
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:35,880
I'm trapped in suburbia.

907
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:40,760
Did he ever take her
to the city?

908
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:43,360
Now you're getting
the hang of it.

909
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:51,360
Jack, can we afford
this place?

910
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:55,400
I'm taking my baby out for our
anniversary. Damn the costs.

911
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:05,120
We'll have the Terrine of Quail Breast
with Shiitake Mushrooms to start.

912
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:09,200
Then the Veal Medallions
in Raspberry Truffle Sauce.

913
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:12,480
And the Sea Scallops
with Pureed Artichoke Hearts.

914
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:16,280
Very good, sir. And may I say,
those are all excellent selections.

915
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:20,080
You may. Also, we'll have
a bottle of Lafite, '82.

916
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:24,080
Honey, that's an $800
bottle of wine.

917
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:29,760
We'll just have some red wine
by the glass.

918
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:37,400
You are so not
off the hook yet, Slick.

919
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:39,320
But I'm getting close, right?

920
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:43,200
You wanna dance?

921
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:48,040
I-I don't think
there's dancing here, Jack.

922
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:49,560
Sure, there is.
Come on.

923
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:27,160
Not bad for a tire salesman
from New Jersey.

924
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:29,120
I have my moments.

925
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:36,760
You gotta try one of these.

926
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:44,760
Ahh.

927
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:47,560
God, I miss that taste.

928
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:53,960
I need to tell you something.

929
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:56,520
Okay.

930
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:59,040
I think it may help us,

931
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:01,800
but there's a slight chance
it could make things worse.

932
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:09,640
I'm living someone else's...

933
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:17,800
I feel like I'm living
someone else's life.

934
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:23,720
I remember I used to
walk to work, and, uh,

935
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:26,920
I had a warm bialy
in my hand,

936
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:30,760
and a hot cup of coffee
from Dean & Deluca,

937
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:35,240
the crisp feeling
of The Wall Street Journal,

938
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:37,920
the smell of leather
from my briefcase.

939
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,280
I used to be so sure about
everything, confident.

940
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:44,920
You know, I-I knew
exactly who I was...

941
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:47,040
and what I wanted.

942
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:51,200
And then one morning,
I woke up...

943
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:55,480
and suddenly
it was all different.

944
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:59,600
- Worse, do you mean?
- No.

945
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:02,080
Well, maybe a few things,

946
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:04,960
but mostly just different.

947
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:07,200
And it's okay.

948
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:10,080
But I never used to
be like this, Kate.

949
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:13,280
I was the guy
who had it all figured out.

950
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:16,360
I had no doubts.
I had no regrets.

951
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:19,160
And now?

952
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:21,080
Now I don't.

953
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:23,360
I don't have it all figured out.

954
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:25,120
Me neither.

955
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:27,320
But you always seem so certain.

956
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:29,880
Do you think there aren't
mornings when I wake up...

957
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,440
and wonder, "What the hell
am I doing in New Jersey?"

958
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:34,240
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

959
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:37,760
- Yeah.
- My office is a dump.

960
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:40,920
I answer my own phone,
and you seen my paycheck.

961
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:44,240
Your paycheck is a disgrace
to paychecks.

962
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:47,880
Can you imagine a life...

963
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,360
where everything was just easy?

964
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:54,680
You know, where you ask for things,
and people just bring them to you?

965
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:56,400
It's wonderful.

966
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:06,000
I think about it too.

967
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:08,320
I do.

968
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:12,200
I wonder about what kind of life I
would have had if I hadn't married you.

969
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:13,840
And?

970
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:19,880
Then I realize I've just erased all the
things in my life that I'm sure about.

971
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,480
You and the kids.

972
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:24,400
Good things.

973
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:26,160
Yeah.

974
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:30,360
What are you sure about?

975
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:33,720
I'm sure that right now,

976
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:36,440
there's nowhere else I'd
rather be than here with you.

977
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:51,920
Oh.

978
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,840
Oh, Jack.

979
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:01,040
You like it?

980
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:10,920
This is beautiful.

981
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:16,760
You know champagne
makes me do crazy things.

982
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:19,840
I'll just fill yours
up to the top.

983
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:26,560
I don't know how you did it,
Hoss, but you pulled it off.

984
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:29,520
- I'm out of the doghouse?
- Way out.

985
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:34,280
Happy anniversary, sweetheart.

986
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:40,720
You may even get lucky
tonight, Jack.

987
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:50,760
You're so beautiful.

988
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:53,640
I already told you
you were gonna get lucky.

989
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:59,000
My God.

990
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:01,240
All this time,

991
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:04,200
I never stopped loving you.

992
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:12,040
That's all I wanted to hear.

993
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:44,920
I'm gonna wear the usual today.

994
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,840
What are you thinking?

995
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:50,720
You want to come to work
with Dad, help me sell tires?

996
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:53,320
It's fun.
I'm pretty good at it.

997
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:56,920
Who's this? Who's that?
Who is that?

998
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:59,400
Who's on that tie?

999
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:01,080
That's Grandpa.

1000
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:02,840
Yes.

1001
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:06,880
Jack!

1002
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:14,080
Mmm.

1003
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:19,600
Have a great day.

1004
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:28,240
For the money, this is hands
down the best radial we carry.

1005
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:30,680
Okay.
I guess I'll take 'em.

1006
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:32,640
You won't regret it.
Tommy.

1007
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:35,960
Would you set Mr. Collin up with four
B.F. Goodrich G-Force T.A.'s?

1008
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:40,800
Give him ten percent off for
having the best costume. Thank you.

1009
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:43,120
You bet. Right this way, sir. Follow me.

1010
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:45,040
Tell me, does the tire
smell good?

1011
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:50,080
Remember our
Valentine's Day special:

1012
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:52,760
balance and alignment for free!

1013
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:01,360
How are you doing today?
It just blew out on me.

1014
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:03,760
Do you have a tire like that?

1015
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:08,040
I seem to have
some sort of a blowout here.

1016
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:10,800
- Why don't you let me take this one, Kenny?
- Okay, chief.

1017
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:13,480
Peter Lassiter.

1018
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:15,560
- Do I know you?
- Not exactly.

1019
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:19,160
I've seen you on CNBC.
You look taller in real life.

1020
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:24,200
Truth is, Mintz was so busy
timing his wife's breathing,

1021
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:27,960
he didn't realize that Med Tech needed
Global more than the other way around.

1022
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:30,680
Ten days, two weeks tops, they would
have approached you with an offer.

1023
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:35,120
I'm willing to bet anything it
would have been 130 billion, not 122.

1024
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:38,400
The trouble is, Peter, you had
a pussycat running the show.

1025
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:40,760
What you needed was a Doberman.

1026
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:45,680
I'm impressed.
I really am.

1027
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:48,920
Now, about my car.

1028
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:53,760
Sure. We're gonna have to
special order that tire,

1029
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:56,320
so it'll be ready
in a couple of days.

1030
01:20:56,440 --> 01:21:01,520
All right.
This is my office address.

1031
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:08,160
Why don't you drop off
the car yourself?

1032
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:40,160
We're really more of a boutique
operation, as you can see.

1033
01:21:40,280 --> 01:21:43,560
But you're not interested in
boutique dollars. I get it.

1034
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:46,040
He's expecting you,
Mr. Lassiter.

1035
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:49,880
Alan, this is Jack Campbell,

1036
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:52,080
the one I was telling you about.

1037
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:54,760
- Of course. Jack. Hi.
- Mr. Mintz.

1038
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:59,120
No, just call me Alan. We like to
cultivate a very casual atmosphere here.

1039
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:03,440
- I can see that.
- What can I tell you? Do you have kids?

1040
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:07,480
Uh, actually, yes.
Two of them. Good ones.

1041
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:10,360
Great, great.
Why don't you have a seat?

1042
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:14,360
Peter mentioned to me that
you're an avid CNBC watcher.

1043
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:19,160
But he didn't say whether you had
any actual Wall Street experience.

1044
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:24,560
Um, I was a sales associate
at E.F. Hutton.

1045
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:26,880
A broker, really?

1046
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,360
And now you're in
the tire business?

1047
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:31,520
That's right.
And auto supply.

1048
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:33,640
In the retail end, I understand.

1049
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:36,800
We get about 60 percent of our
business from automotive service.

1050
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:41,200
And do you mind me asking what kind
of sales you did in the last year?

1051
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:45,080
Just ball park. We did
1.7 million in total revenue.

1052
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:47,200
1.7. That's great.

1053
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:49,400
And what do you project
for this year?

1054
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:51,600
I think we're gonna have
a banner year.

1055
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:54,160
Sales are up almost 20 percent
in the first quarter,

1056
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:56,520
and we just landed a major
trucking company account.

1057
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:59,840
You did? That's great. So that puts
you just a tad over two million?

1058
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:03,400
That's right. And that would
make us number one in our market.

1059
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:05,680
Excuse me. I'm gonna get
a glass of water.

1060
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:20,200
Look, I know our paltry
little $2 million in sales...

1061
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:23,080
is about what you spend a year
on office supplies.

1062
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:25,960
And some regional trucking company
account is nothing compared...

1063
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:28,960
- to a multi-billion-dollar merger.
- No, no, no.

1064
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:32,080
- I'm not trying to knock the tire business.
- It's okay, Alan. I get it.

1065
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:35,520
I'm in your shoes, I'm thinking
the same thing, but here's the deal.

1066
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:38,360
Business is business.
Wall Street, Main Street.

1067
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:40,800
It's all a bunch of people
getting up in the morning,

1068
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:43,440
trying to figure out how they're
going to send their kids to college.

1069
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:47,040
It's just people,
and I know people.

1070
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:49,920
- Oh, I'm sure you do.
- Take you, for instance, Alan.

1071
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,840
You have a certain energy about
you, an active kind of energy.

1072
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:55,680
I wouldn't be surprised if you
drank about 16 Diet Cokes a day.

1073
01:23:55,760 --> 01:24:00,640
You're an excellent father, but you feel
guilty about the time you spend away from home.

1074
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:03,240
You drink bourbon, but you
offer your clients Scotch.

1075
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:06,920
And your wife
decorated this office.

1076
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:09,440
He certainly seems
to have your number.

1077
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:11,400
You're a little tougher,
Peter.

1078
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:13,560
For one thing,
you like expensive things.

1079
01:24:13,640 --> 01:24:16,880
That's easy.
You've seen my car.

1080
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:20,320
You smoke Hoyo de Monterreys.

1081
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:22,440
You're a Scotch man, single malt,

1082
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:25,720
not because it's trendy but because
you've been doing it for 40 years...

1083
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:28,280
and you like to stay
with what works.

1084
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:31,480
You have two great loves
in your life: your horses...

1085
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:33,640
and this company.

1086
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:38,160
And you're a man who prides himself
in finding talent in unusual places.

1087
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:42,640
- How would you know that?
- Because I'm here.

1088
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:45,320
I'm prepared to do whatever
it takes to get this job.

1089
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:47,200
I'll start wherever
I have to start.

1090
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:49,120
I'll park cars if I have to.

1091
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:52,600
The biggest part of judging character
is knowing yourself, and I know this:

1092
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:56,120
I can do this job.
I can.

1093
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:59,360
Give me a chance, Peter.
I won't let you down.

1094
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:08,160
Alan, why don't you
show Jack around?

1095
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:11,680
This is our war room. We did seven
major deals in here last year,

1096
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:13,920
three of them... hostile.

1097
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:16,640
- Seven?
- Yeah. You get a kind of a feeling from...

1098
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:19,560
Can we cut the shit here for a minute?
Where did you get that information?

1099
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:22,240
Did you go through his wallet?
Did you surf some Net?

1100
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:25,080
It doesn't really matter because that
circus act you pulled back there...

1101
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:27,520
may have dazzled Lassiter, but
it doesn't cut any shit with me.

1102
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:29,840
Even if you get this job,
which I highly doubt,

1103
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:31,760
let me just give you
a word of warning.

1104
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:35,080
Peter Lassiter gets tired of his
pet projects very, very quickly.

1105
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:38,960
I've got that big office because I prove
myself to him year after year after year.

1106
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:41,440
Nobody is gonna come in here
and turn the old man's head,

1107
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:44,360
especially not some tire
salesman from New Jersey.

1108
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:46,880
So if you're cautious
and you're quiet,

1109
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:49,320
you watch yourself,
stay away from Lassiter,

1110
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:52,440
maybe I'll think about keeping you
on here after he gets bored with you.

1111
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:54,360
Do we understand each other?

1112
01:25:55,880 --> 01:25:58,080
Alan!

1113
01:25:58,200 --> 01:26:00,000
God, you really are different.

1114
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:02,640
- Excuse me?
- I mean, wow!

1115
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:06,360
I'm impressed. I'm impressed.
Good for you.

1116
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:10,560
Are we understanding
each other?

1117
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:12,520
Yes, Alan, I understand you.

1118
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:15,200
- Okay then.
- Good.

1119
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:18,440
- Good.
- Okay. Okay.

1120
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:20,360
Alan!

1121
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:30,520
Keep your eyes closed.
Hold on.

1122
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:36,360
Go ahead.
Open your eyes.

1123
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:38,280
Welcome to Xanadu.

1124
01:26:41,080 --> 01:26:43,840
It's pretty incredible,
isn't it?

1125
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:46,680
It's like a museum.

1126
01:26:50,920 --> 01:26:52,760
Look around.

1127
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:02,200
So what's the big surprise?

1128
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:04,720
You didn't rent this
for the weekend, did you?

1129
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:07,640
Think... bigger.

1130
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:09,720
For the week?

1131
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:12,480
This place is a perk, Kate.

1132
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:17,120
A perk?

1133
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:18,960
For what?

1134
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:21,880
A company called P.K. Lassiter
Investment House...

1135
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:25,080
uses it to attract
new executives.

1136
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:27,320
I'm going into arbitrage, honey.

1137
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:29,720
It turns out
I have a knack for it.

1138
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:33,680
Jack, what are you
talking about?

1139
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:37,360
I'll be making twice what I
make now, plus a hefty bonus.

1140
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:40,080
That's just to start. And we
can live in this apartment...

1141
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:41,880
practically rent free...

1142
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:44,240
until we find a place of our own.

1143
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:47,280
Are you out of your mind?

1144
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:49,240
I don't think so.

1145
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:52,240
This is gonna be a better life for all of us.
We can put Annie and Josh into private schools.

1146
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:54,360
Annie goes to
a great school, Jack.

1147
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:57,000
I'm talking about the best
schools in the country here.

1148
01:27:57,120 --> 01:28:00,800
What could you possibly be
thinking about? What about my job?

1149
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:04,080
Well, this is New York City. It's like
the needy people capital of the world.

1150
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:08,240
Your Jersey clients aren't a tenth as
pathetic as the ones you could find here.

1151
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:11,840
I can't even believe you're talking
about moving back into the city.

1152
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:15,440
I thought the reason we left was because
we didn't want to raise the kids here.

1153
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:18,680
No. No. This is the
center of the universe.

1154
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:21,400
If I were living in Roman times,
I would live in Rome. Where else?

1155
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:24,160
"Today America is the Roman
empire. New York is Rome itself."

1156
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:26,120
- John Lennon.
- Jack!

1157
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:29,480
Okay, you know something? I'm
detecting, like, a funky tension here.

1158
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:33,360
This was supposed to be a happy day,
so guess what? I don't need this.

1159
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:35,880
We don't have to live here.
Forget it.

1160
01:28:36,040 --> 01:28:38,720
- I'll commute. I'll drive to work.
- God!

1161
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:42,880
In traffic, it's over an hour each
way. That's three hours every day.

1162
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:46,840
- When are you ever going to see the kids?
- Kate.

1163
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:48,960
You're not understanding me.

1164
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:52,840
I'm talking about a
perfect life, a great life.

1165
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:55,320
Everything we pictured when we
were young. The whole package.

1166
01:28:55,480 --> 01:28:58,280
You said so yourself.
Life has thrown us a few surprises,

1167
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:00,240
so we made sacrifices.
Well, guess what?

1168
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:03,520
Now I can finally get us back
on track. I can do that, Kate.

1169
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:07,600
I want to do that.
I need to do that as a man!

1170
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:09,680
For all of us.

1171
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:14,800
Please just think about this
for one second.

1172
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:17,600
No more lousy restaurants.

1173
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:19,760
No more clipping coupons.

1174
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:21,680
No more shoveling snow.

1175
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:23,840
Then get a goddamn
snowblower, Jack!

1176
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:27,800
Don't go get a new career
without even telling me about it!

1177
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:31,640
And don't... don't take Annie
out of a school she loves.

1178
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:36,120
Don't move us out of a house
we've become a family in.

1179
01:29:38,760 --> 01:29:41,200
You're... You're...

1180
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:45,080
Don't you see? I'm talking
about us finally having a life...

1181
01:29:45,160 --> 01:29:47,000
that other people envy.

1182
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:48,920
Oh, Jack.

1183
01:29:50,440 --> 01:29:53,040
They already do envy us.

1184
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:53,000
From London to New York.

1185
01:30:55,480 --> 01:30:57,320
I came back.

1186
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:08,080
When you got on that plane,
I was sure it was over.

1187
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:14,880
I left the airport afraid
I'd never see you again.

1188
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:17,760
And then you showed up
the very next day.

1189
01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:23,200
That was a good surprise.

1190
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:30,400
You know, I think about
the decision you made.

1191
01:31:35,720 --> 01:31:38,400
Maybe I was being naive,
but I believed...

1192
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:42,800
that we would grow old together
in this house,

1193
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:46,920
that we'd spend holidays
here and...

1194
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:52,800
have our grandchildren
come visit us here.

1195
01:31:54,280 --> 01:31:58,320
I had this image of us
all gray and wrinkly,

1196
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:02,440
and me...
working in the garden,

1197
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:05,280
and you repainting the deck.

1198
01:32:15,880 --> 01:32:19,000
But things change.

1199
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:25,360
If you need this, Jack,

1200
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:27,520
if you really need this,

1201
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:30,000
I will take these kids
from a life they love,

1202
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:33,040
and I'll take myself from the only
home we've ever shared together...

1203
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:36,880
and I'll move wherever
you need to go.

1204
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:39,320
I'll do that
because I love you.

1205
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:43,800
I love you,

1206
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:47,640
and that's more important to me
than our address.

1207
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:52,480
I choose us.

1208
01:33:29,680 --> 01:33:32,160
Oh. I'm gonna chase you.

1209
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:35,320
You can't catch me.
No, you can't. You can't.

1210
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:38,520
Oh!

1211
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:43,200
Whoa! Oh. Whoops!

1212
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:45,640
I fell down.

1213
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:52,000
I knew you'd come back.

1214
01:33:57,080 --> 01:33:59,040
Oh, Annie.

1215
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:00,960
I love you.

1216
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:26,240
- What are you doing?
- Ringing my bell.

1217
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:39,120
4.99? It's just salt, for God sakes.

1218
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:41,240
Ninety-nine cents, darling.

1219
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:44,680
Out of ten.

1220
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:48,200
- You!
- Jack!

1221
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:50,440
What's up?
How you feeling, baby?

1222
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:53,720
Why are you here?

1223
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:59,360
Here's your change, darling.
Five, six, seven, eight,

1224
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:01,760
nine, oh-one.

1225
01:35:01,880 --> 01:35:04,320
Is that rock salt?

1226
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:07,960
Look at you, man. Went and got
all domestic and everything.

1227
01:35:08,080 --> 01:35:10,080
You really figured
some things out, huh?

1228
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:12,320
You're not
sending me back.

1229
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:16,960
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

1230
01:35:17,080 --> 01:35:19,000
Hey, did you hear me?

1231
01:35:19,120 --> 01:35:21,800
- Wait a second.
- I'm talking to you.

1232
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:24,080
You see that?

1233
01:35:24,200 --> 01:35:27,680
Character. And for what, for nine
bucks? That's just so disappointing.

1234
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:30,280
I'm not going back.
You understand me?

1235
01:35:30,360 --> 01:35:32,320
- Okay, relax, Jack.
- You can't do this.

1236
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:35,160
You can't keep coming in and out of
people's lives, messing things up.

1237
01:35:35,240 --> 01:35:37,080
It's not right.

1238
01:35:37,160 --> 01:35:41,040
A glimpse, by definition,
is an impermanent thing, Jack.

1239
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:55,320
I've got kids.
I'm going home.

1240
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:54,320
Is it morning yet?

1241
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:56,360
No, honey.

1242
01:36:56,440 --> 01:36:58,280
Go back to sleep.

1243
01:37:03,960 --> 01:37:05,800
Take care, Annie.

1244
01:37:08,120 --> 01:37:10,720
I'm going back to the mother ship.

1245
01:37:18,280 --> 01:37:20,120
Hey.

1246
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:22,040
Hey.

1247
01:37:27,560 --> 01:37:31,760
These past few weeks,
I know I've done some...

1248
01:37:31,880 --> 01:37:34,160
some unusual things.

1249
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:37,960
It's been interesting,
that's for sure.

1250
01:37:40,280 --> 01:37:42,880
I've done some good things,
too, though, haven't I?

1251
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:48,080
You've been Jack Campbell,
and that's always a good thing.

1252
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:56,800
I need you to remember me, Kate.

1253
01:37:56,920 --> 01:37:59,080
How I am right now...

1254
01:37:59,240 --> 01:38:01,800
at this very moment.

1255
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:05,840
I need you to put that image
in your heart and keep it there.

1256
01:38:05,960 --> 01:38:08,920
Keep it with you
no matter what happens.

1257
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:14,600
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1258
01:38:14,680 --> 01:38:17,000
Please just promise me.

1259
01:38:17,120 --> 01:38:20,400
You have to promise me, because if you
don't, then it's like it never happened,

1260
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:22,520
and I don't think
I can live with that.

1261
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:25,640
I promise.

1262
01:38:28,440 --> 01:38:30,280
Promise me again.

1263
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,840
- I promise.
- Okay.

1264
01:38:35,960 --> 01:38:37,760
Now come to bed.

1265
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:42,560
Soon.

1266
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:33,920
Yeah.

1267
01:40:36,240 --> 01:40:38,360
What time is it?

1268
01:40:38,480 --> 01:40:41,000
Okay. Yeah.

1269
01:41:09,560 --> 01:41:12,600
- Waiting for me by the door, huh?
- Paula.

1270
01:41:12,720 --> 01:41:15,080
Wow.

1271
01:41:15,200 --> 01:41:17,440
Merry Christmas.

1272
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:20,360
Christmas?
It's not Christmas.

1273
01:41:20,440 --> 01:41:22,840
It's whatever you
want it to be, Jack.

1274
01:41:22,920 --> 01:41:24,920
It's not Christmas.

1275
01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:27,520
Jack. Jack?

1276
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:13,720
Can I help you?

1277
01:42:13,880 --> 01:42:16,280
Is Kate here?

1278
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:18,320
- Does Kate live here?
- Kate? No.

1279
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:20,800
There's nobody named Kate here.

1280
01:42:22,840 --> 01:42:24,640
Of course not.

1281
01:42:26,040 --> 01:42:28,000
You okay?

1282
01:42:29,680 --> 01:42:31,480
No.

1283
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:46,640
Hello.

1284
01:42:46,760 --> 01:42:49,600
Santa Claus, where are you?
Everybody's here.

1285
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:53,040
- Adelle?
- You're a half an hour late.

1286
01:42:53,200 --> 01:42:55,520
The emergency strategy session?
Trip to Aspen?

1287
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:57,440
Is this ringing any bells?

1288
01:42:57,520 --> 01:43:00,440
Everybody is panicked
here, Jack.

1289
01:43:02,440 --> 01:43:04,840
Jack?

1290
01:43:04,920 --> 01:43:07,400
I'll be there in 20 minutes.

1291
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:11,600
No, I'm not gonna go talk to them until
I have something to talk to them about.

1292
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:14,800
Steve, I don't care if it's
Christmas day. We're in a crisis here.

1293
01:43:14,960 --> 01:43:17,400
Wait a minute. Jack just walked
in. I'll call you back. Jack.

1294
01:43:17,560 --> 01:43:19,880
Thank God that you're...

1295
01:43:19,960 --> 01:43:22,800
- You're here. Are you all right?
- What's going on here?

1296
01:43:22,920 --> 01:43:25,920
What's...
Well, it's not good.

1297
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:29,800
Bob Thomas has been talking to a European drug
company, Jack, and we don't know which one.

1298
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:34,280
They're gonna let Bob buy a minority stake,
and let him keep running the entire company.

1299
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:38,160
Global knows. I don't know how they know,
but they know and they're up in arms.

1300
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:41,600
They think that somehow we should
have been prepared for this. Prepared!

1301
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:44,160
Oh, God, we're in trouble.

1302
01:43:44,240 --> 01:43:47,360
You know something, Alan?

1303
01:43:47,440 --> 01:43:51,720
Somewhere inside of you, there's
a much more assertive person.

1304
01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:55,480
Is this another one of those
Sun Tzu Art of War tricks?

1305
01:43:56,840 --> 01:43:58,640
No.

1306
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:00,760
So what are we gonna do, Jack?

1307
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:03,600
Jack?

1308
01:44:05,400 --> 01:44:08,320
I'll tell you exactly
what we're going to do.

1309
01:44:08,440 --> 01:44:11,080
You're going to do whatever
you have to do to find out...

1310
01:44:11,200 --> 01:44:13,960
which European company
he's been talking to.

1311
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:16,920
Then I'm going to
clean myself up,

1312
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:21,480
fly to Aspen and drink
eggnog with Bob Thomas.

1313
01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:25,360
His wife and kids will be playing
in the background in the snow...

1314
01:44:25,480 --> 01:44:28,240
while I convince him
that the European company...

1315
01:44:28,360 --> 01:44:30,200
is the devil...

1316
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:33,720
and Global is the answer
to his prayers.

1317
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:37,320
Then I'm gonna spend
four hours skiing... alone.

1318
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:42,920
Completely and utterly alone.

1319
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:48,040
I'm going to do that
because that is my life,

1320
01:44:48,160 --> 01:44:50,000
that's what's real...

1321
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:52,680
and there's nothing
I can do to change that.

1322
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:11,760
For Manhattan.

1323
01:45:11,880 --> 01:45:13,720
Kate Reynolds.

1324
01:45:18,360 --> 01:45:20,200
I need an address too.

1325
01:45:44,120 --> 01:45:46,840
It's very fragile, so I want you
to be very careful with it, okay?

1326
01:45:46,920 --> 01:45:49,240
It's valuable.
It's over 300 years old.

1327
01:45:49,360 --> 01:45:51,800
You'll probably need a few
guys to carry it. All right.

1328
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:55,680
The painting is also very,
very old, so take extra care.

1329
01:45:55,760 --> 01:45:58,560
It means a lot to Kate, okay?
I appreciate it.

1330
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:01,840
Yeah? What?

1331
01:46:01,960 --> 01:46:04,800
Are you from the moving
company? I'm Jack Campbell.

1332
01:46:04,920 --> 01:46:07,240
I'm an old... friend of Kate's.

1333
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:10,400
Kate, some guy is here.

1334
01:46:10,480 --> 01:46:14,640
Did you call the airline like I asked
you to do? It's like two hours...

1335
01:46:14,720 --> 01:46:17,360
- Jack.
- Kate.

1336
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:19,880
God, it's been a long time.
You look...

1337
01:46:19,960 --> 01:46:22,640
- You look great.
- Thanks.

1338
01:46:24,200 --> 01:46:26,880
I... Come on in.
Come on in.

1339
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:30,240
I'm just doing some... Lori,
do you know where those boxes...

1340
01:46:31,960 --> 01:46:33,880
I'm sorry.

1341
01:46:34,080 --> 01:46:36,240
No, no, no! You know what... Jack.

1342
01:46:36,360 --> 01:46:38,520
Don't... Please.
I don't even care.

1343
01:46:38,600 --> 01:46:41,040
Oh, great. Thank you.

1344
01:46:42,280 --> 01:46:45,160
- What's going on?
- I'm moving to Paris.

1345
01:46:45,240 --> 01:46:48,400
Hey, Lori, have you seen that
box? It says "Jack" on it.

1346
01:46:48,480 --> 01:46:51,200
I put it with the rest
of the Salvation Army stuff.

1347
01:46:51,280 --> 01:46:53,400
Do you want me to look for the
box or call the airline, Kate?

1348
01:46:53,480 --> 01:46:56,320
Hey, kind of under
a little pressure here.

1349
01:46:56,440 --> 01:46:58,840
Hey, kind of giving up Christmas
day for my ex-boss here.

1350
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:03,240
Hey, didn't mind offering to help when
she was opening the Prada bag I gave her.

1351
01:47:03,400 --> 01:47:06,720
- Maybe it's by the wardrobe boxes.
- Thank you.

1352
01:47:08,120 --> 01:47:11,120
- So you're moving.
- Yeah, to Paris.

1353
01:47:11,240 --> 01:47:14,520
My firm has an office there.
I'm gonna be heading it up.

1354
01:47:14,600 --> 01:47:17,440
Paris. Paris, France?

1355
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:20,000
That's the one.

1356
01:47:20,120 --> 01:47:23,280
So you're... you're not
at a nonprofit firm?

1357
01:47:23,360 --> 01:47:25,720
God, no, not with
what they pay me.

1358
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:28,080
Are you married?

1359
01:47:28,160 --> 01:47:31,560
No, I never got married,
Jack. You?

1360
01:47:31,640 --> 01:47:34,360
Not exactly.

1361
01:47:34,480 --> 01:47:36,680
Look, could we take a minute here,

1362
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:38,840
maybe go get a cup of coffee
or something?

1363
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:42,240
- I'll go for a cup of coffee.
- Yes. I found it.

1364
01:47:42,320 --> 01:47:44,800
Congratulations. Your
earlier flight was canceled,

1365
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:47,160
but I got you out of
Kennedy on United at 7:00.

1366
01:47:47,240 --> 01:47:49,720
- Excellent.
- Am I good or what?

1367
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:51,680
Yes, you're brilliant.

1368
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:53,600
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1369
01:47:53,680 --> 01:47:57,160
Here you go. It's just
some old stuff of yours.

1370
01:47:57,240 --> 01:48:00,520
Do you ever think
about us, Kate?

1371
01:48:00,600 --> 01:48:02,440
About what might have happened?

1372
01:48:07,960 --> 01:48:09,800
Jack, I'll tell you what.

1373
01:48:09,920 --> 01:48:13,960
If you're ever in Paris, look me up and
we'll go have that cup of coffee, okay?

1374
01:48:14,040 --> 01:48:17,160
Or cafe. Or cafe au lait.
Oh, wait. No, no, no, no!

1375
01:48:17,240 --> 01:48:21,000
Don't close that up. I will
never find this box again.

1376
01:48:21,080 --> 01:48:24,000
Well, I marked it. Just
be more specific next time.

1377
01:48:27,720 --> 01:48:31,040
We'll leave it open then. I was
just trying to close it up.

1378
01:48:37,680 --> 01:48:39,520
Make a right here.

1379
01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:42,000
Sir, you're gonna be late
for your flight.

1380
01:48:42,120 --> 01:48:45,000
We're not going to the airport.

1381
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:10,680
You can't leave this here.

1382
01:50:10,760 --> 01:50:12,640
You can't park here!

1383
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:38,680
Kate! You can't go.

1384
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:41,560
- Don't get on that plane.
- Jack?

1385
01:50:41,680 --> 01:50:44,320
Please, let's just go have a cup of
coffee. That's all I'm asking for.

1386
01:50:44,440 --> 01:50:47,640
I'm sure there's another
flight to Paris tonight.

1387
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:51,440
Jack.
What are you doing here?

1388
01:50:55,440 --> 01:50:57,400
Do you need closure?

1389
01:50:57,480 --> 01:51:00,360
Because if you do, after
all these years, you got it.

1390
01:51:00,480 --> 01:51:03,200
I'm okay. I'm fine.

1391
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:08,120
I... I was heartbroken, Jack,

1392
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:11,520
but I got over it,
I moved on, and...

1393
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:15,960
you should move on too.

1394
01:51:16,040 --> 01:51:18,520
Okay? I'm sorry.

1395
01:51:18,680 --> 01:51:22,040
I just can't...
I've gotta go.

1396
01:51:22,240 --> 01:51:25,320
I-I... I'm sorry, Jack.
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

1397
01:51:30,160 --> 01:51:32,480
Can I just...
I'm sorry. I was here.

1398
01:51:44,120 --> 01:51:46,840
We have a house in Jersey!

1399
01:51:48,240 --> 01:51:50,520
We have two kids.

1400
01:51:50,640 --> 01:51:52,800
Annie and Josh.

1401
01:51:52,920 --> 01:51:56,520
Annie's not much of a violin
player, but she tries real hard.

1402
01:51:56,640 --> 01:52:01,680
She's a little precocious, but that's
only because she says what's on her mind.

1403
01:52:01,800 --> 01:52:04,800
And when she smiles...

1404
01:52:06,840 --> 01:52:08,680
And Josh,

1405
01:52:08,760 --> 01:52:10,920
he has your eyes.

1406
01:52:11,080 --> 01:52:14,440
He doesn't say much,
but we know he's smart.

1407
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:16,640
He's always got his eyes open.

1408
01:52:16,760 --> 01:52:19,040
You know,
he's always watching us.

1409
01:52:19,160 --> 01:52:22,840
Sometimes you can look at him
and you just know...

1410
01:52:22,960 --> 01:52:25,440
he's learning something new.

1411
01:52:25,640 --> 01:52:27,960
It's like witnessing a miracle.

1412
01:52:28,040 --> 01:52:31,680
The house is a mess,
but it's ours.

1413
01:52:31,800 --> 01:52:36,160
After 120 more payments,
it's going to be ours.

1414
01:52:36,280 --> 01:52:39,920
And you,
you're a nonprofit lawyer.

1415
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:43,800
That's right.
You're completely nonprofit.

1416
01:52:43,920 --> 01:52:46,360
But that doesn't seem
to bother you.

1417
01:52:48,720 --> 01:52:51,400
And we're in love.

1418
01:52:51,480 --> 01:52:54,880
After 13 years of marriage,
we're still unbelievably in love.

1419
01:52:56,440 --> 01:53:00,000
You won't even let me touch you
till I've said it.

1420
01:53:00,120 --> 01:53:01,920
I sing to you.

1421
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:06,400
Not all the time, but
definitely on special occasions.

1422
01:53:06,480 --> 01:53:10,920
And we've... we've dealt with our share
of surprises and made a lot of sacrifices,

1423
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,760
but we stayed together.

1424
01:53:13,840 --> 01:53:15,680
You see,

1425
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:20,040
you're a better person
than I am,

1426
01:53:20,120 --> 01:53:24,680
and it made me a better
person to be around you.

1427
01:53:24,760 --> 01:53:27,240
I don't know. Maybe it
was all just a dream.

1428
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:29,880
Maybe I went to bed one
lonely night in December,

1429
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,440
and I imagined it all, but...

1430
01:53:32,600 --> 01:53:35,480
I swear, nothing's ever
felt more real.

1431
01:53:38,160 --> 01:53:42,040
And if you get
on that plane right now,

1432
01:53:42,160 --> 01:53:44,600
it'll disappear forever.

1433
01:53:47,440 --> 01:53:51,000
I know we could both go on with
our lives, and we'd both be fine.

1434
01:53:51,120 --> 01:53:53,400
But I've seen...

1435
01:53:53,520 --> 01:53:55,560
what we could be like together.

1436
01:53:59,280 --> 01:54:02,000
And I choose us.

1437
01:54:03,800 --> 01:54:05,600
Please, Kate.

1438
01:54:05,680 --> 01:54:08,520
One cup of coffee.

1439
01:54:08,600 --> 01:54:11,200
You can always
go to Paris.

1440
01:54:11,280 --> 01:54:13,800
Just... please,

1441
01:54:14,920 --> 01:54:16,760
not tonight.

1442
01:54:26,480 --> 01:54:28,320
Okay, Jack.

1443
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:35,400
Okay.
