1
00:00:28,388 --> 00:00:32,666
THEY LIVE

2
00:02:54,428 --> 00:02:58,057
JOB OPPORTUNITIES

3
00:03:10,388 --> 00:03:14,620
- Last place of employment?
- Denver, Colorado.

4
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:19,060
I worked there for ten years ...
but then things just dried up.

5
00:03:20,308 --> 00:03:24,187
They lost 14 banks in one week.

6
00:03:30,268 --> 00:03:33,624
There's nothing available for you,
right now.

7
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:47,979
They use their tongues to
deceive you. Venom is on their lips.

8
00:03:48,188 --> 00:03:54,184
Their mouths are full
of bitterness and curses.

9
00:03:54,388 --> 00:03:58,540
The fear of God
is not before their eyes.

10
00:03:58,748 --> 00:04:06,507
They have taken
the hearts and minds of our leaders.

11
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:09,700
They have blinded us to the truth.

12
00:04:09,908 --> 00:04:15,744
Our human spirit is corrupted.
Why do we worship greed?

13
00:04:15,948 --> 00:04:21,659
Outside the limit of our sight
they're feeding off us.

14
00:04:21,868 --> 00:04:28,421
Perched on top of us
from birth to death, are our owners.

15
00:04:28,628 --> 00:04:33,304
They have us. They control us.
They are our masters.

16
00:04:33,508 --> 00:04:37,262
Wake up.
They're all around you.

17
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:08,181
Sometimes when I watch TV
I stop being myself, I'm a star,

18
00:05:08,388 --> 00:05:14,020
Ihave my own talk show, Or I'm
on the news getting out of a limo,

19
00:05:14,228 --> 00:05:19,177
AIll everhave to do is be famous,
People watch me,

20
00:05:19,388 --> 00:05:22,744
And they love me,

21
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:28,341
I nevergrow old, and never die,

22
00:05:46,508 --> 00:05:49,500
Excuse me,
do you need anybody?

23
00:05:51,148 --> 00:05:54,823
- Maybe.
- I've got my own tools.

24
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:59,587
This is a union job.

25
00:06:04,388 --> 00:06:11,817
May I please speak
with the shop steward, sir?

26
00:06:46,628 --> 00:06:51,622
There's no sleeping on this site.
Sleep somewhere else tonight.

27
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:55,821
Excuse me, when do I get paid?

28
00:06:56,028 --> 00:06:58,462
Thursday.

29
00:07:10,228 --> 00:07:13,106
Do you need a place to stay?

30
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:19,747
There's a place over on 4th street.
They've got hot food and showers.

31
00:07:47,108 --> 00:07:51,021
I don't like being followed
unless I know why.

32
00:07:51,228 --> 00:07:56,780
I don't turn up with anybody
until I see where he's going.

33
00:08:18,148 --> 00:08:21,823
They'll be serving food up soon.

34
00:08:33,028 --> 00:08:39,217
This is Gilbert. Anything you need,
he knows where to find it.

35
00:08:40,588 --> 00:08:43,500
- What's in the pack, tools?
- Yes, sir.

36
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:49,260
Ifyou can use them,
you can fix the shower over there.

37
00:08:49,468 --> 00:08:52,665
Let's get something to eat.

38
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:14,417
- More?
- Yeah.

39
00:09:22,148 --> 00:09:26,380
I've got a wife and two kids
back in Detroit.

40
00:09:26,588 --> 00:09:30,661
I haven't seen them in six months.

41
00:09:30,868 --> 00:09:36,704
The steel mills were laying people off.
They finally went under.

42
00:09:38,508 --> 00:09:45,346
We gave the steel companies a break.
They gave themselves pay raises.

43
00:09:46,828 --> 00:09:52,027
The golden rule: He who has the gold
makes the rules.

44
00:09:55,548 --> 00:10:00,986
Ifthey close one more factory, we
should take a sledge to their foreign cars.

45
00:10:01,188 --> 00:10:06,057
- You should have more patience.
- I'm all out.

46
00:10:07,508 --> 00:10:11,581
The whole deal
is some kind of crazy game.

47
00:10:11,788 --> 00:10:16,339
The name ofthe game is:
Make it through life.

48
00:10:16,548 --> 00:10:22,896
Only everyone is out for themselves
and looking to do you in.

49
00:10:23,108 --> 00:10:29,547
You do what you can, but I'm going
to do my best to blow your ass away.

50
00:10:34,908 --> 00:10:41,347
- So how are you going to make it?
- My chance will come.

51
00:10:41,548 --> 00:10:45,746
I believe in America.
I follow the rules.

52
00:10:46,788 --> 00:10:51,498
Everybody has got
their own hard times, these days.

53
00:11:12,868 --> 00:11:18,818
You thoughtpress-on nails would
impede all the active things you do,

54
00:11:19,028 --> 00:11:24,261
We've gotbeautiful, natural-looking,
easy-to-applynails,

55
00:11:24,468 --> 00:11:28,381
There's seven different colors ,,,

56
00:11:29,908 --> 00:11:32,627
Ourimpulses are being redirected,

57
00:11:32,828 --> 00:11:38,107
We live in an artificially-induced
state ofconsciousness,

58
00:11:38,308 --> 00:11:43,177
Goddamn hacker. That's the second
time tonight that asshole has cut in.

59
00:11:43,388 --> 00:11:47,939
The movementbegan eightmonths ago
bya group ofscientists,

60
00:11:48,148 --> 00:11:53,097
Theyaccidentally discovered
these signals being sent,,,

61
00:11:56,108 --> 00:11:59,180
That thing's giving me a headache.

62
00:11:59,388 --> 00:12:03,017
It must have taken him months
to figure out how to do this.

63
00:12:03,228 --> 00:12:09,497
The under-class is growing,
Human rights are non-existent,

64
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:17,262
In theirrepressive society, we
are their unwitting accomplices,

65
00:12:18,748 --> 00:12:23,868
Their intention to rule rests with
the annihilation ofconsciousness,

66
00:12:24,068 --> 00:12:30,746
We have been lulledinto a trance,
Theyhave made us indifferent,

67
00:12:30,948 --> 00:12:36,261
We are focused
only on our own gain ,,,

68
00:12:43,628 --> 00:12:48,383
Theyare safe
as long as theyare not discovered,

69
00:12:48,588 --> 00:12:53,946
Thatis theirmethod ofsurvival,
Keep us asleep, Keep us selfiish,

70
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:59,541
- Keep us sedated,
- Blow it out ofyour ass.

71
00:14:21,588 --> 00:14:27,777
- Choir practice was late last night.
- The church lets us use their kitchen.

72
00:14:29,348 --> 00:14:34,945
- Till four in the morning?
- We care for a lot of people here.

73
00:14:43,588 --> 00:14:49,982
The sleeping middle-class
is suddenlybecomingpoor,

74
00:14:50,188 --> 00:14:56,104
We are their cattle,
We are being bredforslavery,

75
00:14:56,988 --> 00:15:02,346
- Not again.
- We cannotbreak theirsignal,

76
00:15:02,548 --> 00:15:07,861
The signalmustbe shut off
at the source,

77
00:15:08,068 --> 00:15:10,980
- I have a headache.
- Me too, honey.

78
00:15:14,588 --> 00:15:20,106
- What was that all about?
- That idiot's licking his nuts again.

79
00:16:49,948 --> 00:16:53,304
THEY LIVE WE SLEEP

80
00:17:07,188 --> 00:17:09,907
There's nothing wrong with it.

81
00:17:12,068 --> 00:17:15,743
Only a few seconds got on the air.

82
00:17:15,948 --> 00:17:20,578
Forget about breaking their signal.
Theyjustjam us out again.

83
00:17:20,788 --> 00:17:27,136
- Put the shipment out on the street.
- It won't work. We've discussed this.

84
00:17:27,348 --> 00:17:30,226
We have no other choice.

85
00:17:37,748 --> 00:17:44,187
Robbing banks. Making our own lenses.
We just can't reach enough people.

86
00:17:52,828 --> 00:17:55,501
We've got to find strong people
who'll work with us.

87
00:18:23,668 --> 00:18:29,061
I'm just leaving. Your door was open.
I just thought I'd close it.

88
00:18:29,268 --> 00:18:34,581
- Neighborhood watch.
- Let me touch your face.

89
00:18:34,788 --> 00:18:37,905
Now your hands.

90
00:18:38,108 --> 00:18:42,579
You're a working man.
The revolution ...

91
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:48,146
- Let me show you.
- Maybe some other time.

92
00:18:49,108 --> 00:18:54,182
This world may have blinded me,
but the Lord let me see.

93
00:18:54,388 --> 00:18:57,539
You'll be back.

94
00:19:13,348 --> 00:19:18,900
I've been hearing stuff on the street.
Weird stuff.

95
00:19:19,108 --> 00:19:22,464
An epidemic of violence
is what they're saying.

96
00:19:22,668 --> 00:19:26,217
I was talking
to one old boy from San Anselmo.

97
00:19:26,428 --> 00:19:32,503
He says up there they're talking
end-of-the-world kind of stuff.

98
00:19:47,108 --> 00:19:51,306
- What are they doing?
- Shooting people, robbing banks.

99
00:19:51,508 --> 00:19:58,266
A whole lot of people going crazy
over some nutty dream theyjust had.

100
00:20:00,988 --> 00:20:05,937
The truth is, this kind of shit
happens at the end of every century.

101
00:20:06,148 --> 00:20:10,221
It's just people
afraid to face the future.

102
00:20:18,908 --> 00:20:21,422
What's happening?

103
00:20:21,628 --> 00:20:27,737
I was inside there. It's full of boxes
and some kind of lab setup.

104
00:20:27,948 --> 00:20:32,066
- What do you mean?
- The singing is a tape recording.

105
00:20:34,508 --> 00:20:39,138
Leave it alone, man.
It's none of our business.

106
00:20:39,348 --> 00:20:42,863
Gilbert is in there helping them.

107
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:52,862
I've got ajob now.
I just keep walking the white line.

108
00:20:53,068 --> 00:20:58,461
I don't bother nobody. Nobody bothers
me. You should do the same.

109
00:21:05,148 --> 00:21:11,223
The line in the middle ofthe road.
That's the worst place to drive.

110
00:21:14,348 --> 00:21:19,024
- I'll see you later.
- See you later.

111
00:22:04,148 --> 00:22:08,585
Step down. Easy. This way.

112
00:22:12,868 --> 00:22:16,986
Now we cross the road.
It's dirt here.

113
00:22:55,548 --> 00:22:57,220
Go, go!

114
00:24:36,228 --> 00:24:38,219
Frank!

115
00:25:22,628 --> 00:25:28,066
Leave us alone.
We know you.

116
00:25:40,788 --> 00:25:46,863
"Though I walk through the valley of
the shadow of death, I fear no evil."

117
00:27:12,468 --> 00:27:17,144
- Come and join the party.
- You go with them.

118
00:27:35,468 --> 00:27:38,904
Did somebody start WW Ill?

119
00:28:02,148 --> 00:28:08,144
Oman's collection
puts passion before fashion,

120
00:28:08,348 --> 00:28:12,546
Outgoes glitter
andin comes divine excess,

121
00:28:12,748 --> 00:28:20,587
The warm collection revels
in freedom ofexpression,

122

OBEY

What's your problem?

131
00:33:16,068 --> 00:33:18,298
What's your problem?

132
00:33:26,228 --> 00:33:29,300
How are you today, sir?

133
00:33:31,828 --> 00:33:34,103
Thank you, sir.

134
00:33:38,668 --> 00:33:41,501
Here you are, sir. Thank you.

135
00:33:57,988 --> 00:34:02,220
Are you going to pay for that?

136
00:34:06,388 --> 00:34:07,741
THIS IS YOUR GOD

137
00:34:08,348 --> 00:34:13,786
I don't want no hassle.
Pay for it or put it back.

138
00:34:21,708 --> 00:34:23,505
Sleep,

139
00:34:24,308 --> 00:34:25,900
Sleep,

140
00:34:26,428 --> 00:34:28,498
Sleep,

141
00:34:54,268 --> 00:34:57,578
She didn't even go to Lamas class.

142
00:34:57,788 --> 00:35:02,737
I told her,
for yourself and the baby, go.

143
00:35:36,068 --> 00:35:43,383
- Did you go to Mary Ellen's?
- She served tortillas! So dated!

144
00:35:52,148 --> 00:35:56,300
- I'm so depressed. What do I do?
- Go for it, man.

145
00:35:56,508 --> 00:36:00,899
That's easy for you to say,
you got the promotion.

146
00:36:01,708 --> 00:36:08,386
The feeling is definitely there,
It's a newmorning in America,

147
00:36:08,588 --> 00:36:12,820
The old cynicism is gone,
We have faith in ourleaders,

148
00:36:13,028 --> 00:36:16,464
We're optimistic
as to whatbecomes ofitall,

149
00:36:16,668 --> 00:36:22,698
Itreallyboils down
to ourability to accept,

150
00:36:22,908 --> 00:36:28,380
- There are no limits,
- I figured on something like this.

151
00:36:31,028 --> 00:36:32,700
Excuse me.

152
00:36:33,628 --> 00:36:38,622
You look like your head
fell in the cheese dip back in 1957.

153
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:48,022
You're okay.
This one, real fucking ugly.

154
00:36:48,228 --> 00:36:52,779
I take these glasses off,
she looks like a regular person.

155
00:36:52,988 --> 00:36:58,506
- I put them on, formaldehyde face.
- That's enough, or I call the cops.

156
00:36:58,708 --> 00:37:02,940
The cops?
You need a Brazilian plastic surgeon.

157
00:37:04,668 --> 00:37:08,058
I've got one that can see.

158
00:37:16,268 --> 00:37:21,501
He's a tall, Caucasian male.
Unarmed, wearing sunglasses.

159
00:37:21,708 --> 00:37:25,667
I don't like this one bit.

160
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:28,302
Not one bit.

161
00:37:49,704 --> 00:37:53,299
That's like pouring perfume on a pig.

162
00:37:57,344 --> 00:38:02,862
Settle down.
Where did you get those glasses?

163
00:38:03,064 --> 00:38:06,818
- The tooth fairy.
- I'll bet.

164
00:38:08,824 --> 00:38:12,783
- We've got him.
- Cut yourself shaving?

165
00:38:12,984 --> 00:38:17,057
You look as shitty to us
as we do to you.

166
00:38:17,264 --> 00:38:22,418
- Impossible.
- Don't make us splatter your brains.

167
00:38:24,064 --> 00:38:31,061
You stumbled onto something here,
but maybe we can all benefit from it.

168
00:38:32,824 --> 00:38:37,102
Let's go someplace quiet
so we can talk this over.

169
00:38:57,184 --> 00:39:00,654
You bastards die just like we do.

170
00:39:47,224 --> 00:39:51,775
I have come here to chew bubblegum
and kick ass.

171
00:39:54,744 --> 00:39:58,100
And I'm all out of bubblegum.

172
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:18,337
Near the entrance. Has a shotgun.
White male. 30s. Long hair.

173
00:40:18,544 --> 00:40:23,413
- Momma don't like tattletales.
- Wearing sunglasses.

174
00:40:48,584 --> 00:40:51,815
And who are you?

175
00:40:53,544 --> 00:40:58,413
Come to show them where I am.

176
00:41:06,784 --> 00:41:09,582
Drop it.

177
00:41:09,824 --> 00:41:13,260
Drop it.

178
00:41:19,264 --> 00:41:21,983
Beat it.

179
00:41:57,144 --> 00:42:02,172
Take it easy.
We're just going on a little ride.

180
00:42:05,744 --> 00:42:08,622
Close the door.

181
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:17,894
Drive.

182
00:42:19,664 --> 00:42:22,417
Not too fast.

183
00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:50,422
They're gone.

184
00:42:55,264 --> 00:42:58,859
- Just keep driving.
- Where am I going?

185
00:42:59,064 --> 00:43:02,295
- Are you married?
- Yes.

186
00:43:04,584 --> 00:43:09,214
- Please, don't lie to me.
- No.

187
00:43:10,904 --> 00:43:13,623
Live alone?

188
00:43:15,144 --> 00:43:18,853
- Your place.
- I'd rather not.

189
00:43:19,064 --> 00:43:23,296
I'm afraid I must insist.

190
00:43:54,944 --> 00:43:56,980
Hi, Holly!

191
00:44:28,664 --> 00:44:34,534
- I don't know what you want.
- Just quiet.

192
00:44:36,144 --> 00:44:40,820
It's like a drug. Wearing
these glasses makes you high ...

193
00:44:41,024 --> 00:44:43,458
... but you come down hard.

194
00:44:43,664 --> 00:44:49,534
- Things didn't turn out well today.
- You're not the only one.

195
00:44:50,624 --> 00:44:55,982
I'm sorry,
but I needed you to get away.

196
00:44:56,184 --> 00:45:03,943
You have two guns.
You're not sorry, you're in charge.

197
00:45:05,784 --> 00:45:13,259
We're in trouble. They're everywhere.
You can see them with these glasses.

198
00:45:13,464 --> 00:45:18,538
We're being controlled by these things
and we've got to stop them.

199
00:45:18,744 --> 00:45:25,980
I'll do whatever you want,
just don't hurt me, please.

200
00:45:26,184 --> 00:45:29,972
Listen to what I'm saying to you.

201
00:45:32,504 --> 00:45:38,261
You're fighting the forces of evil ...
that can only be seen with sunglasses.

202
00:45:41,024 --> 00:45:46,542
- Take a look.
- I'll wear your glasses, ifyou want.

203
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:51,818
If I don't see what you see,
I'm going to see it anyway.

204
00:45:56,464 --> 00:46:04,052
- You have it your way.
- It's not my way ... It's your way.

205
00:46:42,784 --> 00:46:48,700
- Don't fuck with me.
- I'm thirsty.

206
00:46:53,104 --> 00:46:55,459
Go ahead.

207
00:47:15,224 --> 00:47:20,901
I'm sorry I have to be here.

208
00:47:33,344 --> 00:47:38,941
- So your name's Holly?
- Holly Thompson.

209
00:47:41,424 --> 00:47:45,975
That's a pretty name.
What do you do?

210
00:47:48,624 --> 00:47:52,617
Assistant program director. Cable 54.

211
00:47:52,824 --> 00:47:59,093
A TV station? They're sending
signals out of TV sets.

212
00:48:12,824 --> 00:48:17,215
No, I'm all right.

213
00:48:25,544 --> 00:48:30,777
Holly Thompson.
8634 Circle View Drive.

214
00:48:45,744 --> 00:48:49,020
Yes, I'll hold.

215
00:50:47,824 --> 00:50:50,543
Frank?

216
00:50:51,744 --> 00:50:56,943
- Don't let anybody see you.
- I've had a rough couple of days.

217
00:50:57,144 --> 00:51:00,773
I want nothing to do with you.
How many people did you kill?

218
00:51:00,984 --> 00:51:04,420
- They're not people.
- You crazy son-of-a-bitch.

219
00:51:04,624 --> 00:51:07,263
You ain't showing me nothing.

220
00:51:07,464 --> 00:51:11,503
I've got a wife and kids.
Leave me alone.

221
00:51:14,184 --> 00:51:16,220
Get out of here.

222
00:52:34,104 --> 00:52:36,459
No!

223
00:53:08,664 --> 00:53:15,183
One week's pay.
It's the best I could do.

224
00:53:19,744 --> 00:53:22,133
Wait!

225
00:53:22,344 --> 00:53:25,575
You'd better find someplace to hide.

226
00:53:25,784 --> 00:53:28,935
- Try these on.
- You crazy mother!

227
00:53:29,144 --> 00:53:33,456
- Put these on.
- Stay away from me.

228
00:53:38,904 --> 00:53:43,136
I'm trying to save you
and your family's life.

229
00:53:43,344 --> 00:53:47,576
You can't even save yourself.

230
00:53:49,144 --> 00:53:56,141
I'm giving you a choice. Put these on
or start eating that trash can.

231
00:53:56,944 --> 00:54:00,732
- Not this year.
- Okay.

232
00:54:04,064 --> 00:54:07,613
Come on.

233
00:54:25,664 --> 00:54:30,260
I don't want to fight you.
Stop it.

234
00:54:35,304 --> 00:54:37,898
Put on the glasses.

235
00:54:54,864 --> 00:54:58,334
I told you
I didn't want to be involved.

236
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:08,983
Dirty motherfucker.

237
00:55:23,144 --> 00:55:27,023
Take a look. Put them on.

238
00:55:32,504 --> 00:55:34,381
No!

239
00:57:08,344 --> 00:57:11,063
I'm sorry.

240
00:57:27,304 --> 00:57:30,740
Put the glasses on. Put them on!

241
00:57:52,584 --> 00:57:55,337
Fuck you!

242
00:58:49,544 --> 00:58:51,739
Look! They're everywhere.

243
00:58:51,944 --> 00:58:55,095
They can see us.
They're at 5th and Spring.

244
00:58:56,824 --> 00:59:01,944
Hold on. You aren't the first one
to wake up out of a dream.

245
00:59:02,144 --> 00:59:04,499
What's that?

246
00:59:12,424 --> 00:59:18,693
Brother, life's a bitch ...
and she's back in heat.

247
00:59:56,784 --> 00:59:59,218
I want a room.

248
01:00:44,544 --> 01:00:47,854
Ain't love grand?

249
01:00:53,184 --> 01:00:55,982
CONFORM

250
01:01:07,704 --> 01:01:13,654
Don't wear those glasses too long.
It's like a knife in your skull.

251
01:01:19,464 --> 01:01:23,218
- How long have they been there?
- Who knows?

252
01:01:23,424 --> 01:01:27,895
- Where do they come from?
- They ain't from Cleveland.

253
01:01:28,104 --> 01:01:32,461
I don't need that shit!
What are we going to do?

254
01:01:33,424 --> 01:01:38,100
- Wait.
- Wait for what?

255
01:01:38,304 --> 01:01:43,901
When you get your master plan,
you let me know.

256
01:01:50,424 --> 01:01:56,101
Ifwe can see, we've got to find
the people who made these.

257
01:01:57,024 --> 01:02:01,734
Yeah, if any ofthem are still alive.

258
01:02:17,504 --> 01:02:22,180
A long time ago,
things were different.

259
01:02:23,264 --> 01:02:30,454
Daddy took me down to the river and
told me about the power and the glory.

260
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:33,303
I was saved.

261
01:02:33,504 --> 01:02:40,819
He changed when I was little.
He turned mean.

262
01:02:42,544 --> 01:02:46,742
I ran away when I was 13.

263
01:02:47,944 --> 01:02:53,894
He tried to cut me once
with a big old razor.

264
01:02:54,104 --> 01:03:00,976
He held it up against my throat.
I said: "Daddy, please."

265
01:03:01,184 --> 01:03:08,454
He kept moving back and forth,
like he was sawing down a tree.

266
01:03:13,024 --> 01:03:18,223
Maybe they've always been with us,
those things out there.

267
01:03:18,424 --> 01:03:23,737
Maybe they love it,
seeing us hate each other.

268
01:03:23,944 --> 01:03:29,143
Watching us kill each other off.
Feeding on our own cold hearts.

269
01:03:32,584 --> 01:03:35,462
I've got news for him.

270
01:03:35,664 --> 01:03:39,373
There's going to be hell to pay.

271
01:03:39,584 --> 01:03:44,578
I ain't Daddy's little boy no more.

272
01:04:07,544 --> 01:04:10,012
Frank?

273
01:04:22,184 --> 01:04:28,498
There's a meeting tonight at 11.
Watch out no one follows you.

274
01:04:30,584 --> 01:04:33,894
The world needs a wake-up call.

275
01:04:35,864 --> 01:04:39,334
We're going to phone it in.

276
01:04:55,584 --> 01:04:57,939
Hey brothers ...

277
01:04:59,584 --> 01:05:02,974
There's something new going down.

278
01:05:28,824 --> 01:05:35,423
They're using candyfloss packaging
to cover up a toxic waste dump.

279
01:05:45,664 --> 01:05:52,695
Frank, glad you made it. Take your
glasses off. We're all human in here.

280
01:06:02,344 --> 01:06:06,303
They're brand new.
We got the first shipment today.

281
01:06:07,464 --> 01:06:11,059
They won't hurt.
There's less interference.

282
01:06:12,784 --> 01:06:15,423
Go ahead.

283
01:06:35,464 --> 01:06:38,615
- Any trouble getting here?
- No.

284
01:06:38,824 --> 01:06:42,897
The city is crawling with cops.
Most ofthem are human.

285
01:06:43,104 --> 01:06:50,180
They've been told we're Commies.
Some ofthem have been recruited.

286
01:06:50,384 --> 01:06:54,138
- People are joining up with them?
- They sell out.

287
01:06:54,344 --> 01:07:00,897
Promotions, bank accounts,
new houses, cars.

288
01:07:01,104 --> 01:07:06,303
Perfect, isn't it?
We'll do anything to be rich.

289
01:07:08,384 --> 01:07:15,301
Fluorocarbons have increasedsince
1958, Earth is being acclimatised,

290
01:07:15,504 --> 01:07:19,702
Theyare turning ouratmosphere
into theiratmosphere,

291
01:07:19,904 --> 01:07:24,659
- What do these things want?
- They're free-enterprisers.

292
01:07:24,864 --> 01:07:30,814
The earth is just another developing
planet. Their third world.

293
01:07:31,024 --> 01:07:34,903
,,, deplete the planet,
move on to another,

294
01:07:35,104 --> 01:07:42,055
They wantbenign indifference,
We couldbe pets orfood,

295
01:07:42,264 --> 01:07:45,461
Butall we reallyare is livestock,

296
01:07:48,344 --> 01:07:53,372
We need an assault unit.
Someone to hit them hard.

297
01:07:53,584 --> 01:07:58,783
- You've got it.
- Ever seen their disappearing act?

298
01:07:58,984 --> 01:08:01,703
Once.

299
01:08:01,904 --> 01:08:05,897
- What's that?
- One oftheir watches.

300
01:08:06,104 --> 01:08:11,098
Two-way radios.
You can listen to their broadcasts.

301
01:08:15,384 --> 01:08:20,777
They've got secret code.
They push a button ...

302
01:08:20,984 --> 01:08:26,820
All of a sudden they're gone.
I've been trying to figure it out.

303
01:08:27,024 --> 01:08:33,054
Listen up. We're obviously
not getting to enough people.

304
01:08:33,264 --> 01:08:39,055
There should be twice as many people
here. We're getting too sloppy.

305
01:08:39,264 --> 01:08:45,180
Their detection
is becoming more effective.

306
01:08:45,384 --> 01:08:51,459
Stay aware. Go to work.
Do what's expected ofyou.

307
01:08:51,664 --> 01:08:55,134
We've become reckless.
The movement is suffering.

308
01:08:55,344 --> 01:09:02,534
Stop talking about it. It's time
we started spilling some blood.

309
01:09:02,744 --> 01:09:09,297
Wait a minute! We don't stand a chance
with a few guns and grenades.

310
01:09:09,504 --> 01:09:13,292
- What are we supposed to do?
- We bide our time.

311
01:09:13,504 --> 01:09:18,180
We locate their signal
and shut it off.

312
01:09:18,384 --> 01:09:25,222
Dave works at KRDA.
He may have located the signal.

313
01:09:25,424 --> 01:09:28,177
KRDA is clear.

314
01:09:28,384 --> 01:09:32,935
The transmission is going out clean.
The signal is from somewhere else.

315
01:09:39,024 --> 01:09:45,054
It's important to find out exactly
where this signal is coming from.

316
01:09:45,264 --> 01:09:49,018
I've got to talk to someone.

317
01:10:01,304 --> 01:10:07,300
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

318
01:10:07,504 --> 01:10:12,214
- I thought I'd killed you.
- I thought so, too.

319
01:10:15,304 --> 01:10:20,537
I didn't know.
I'm so sorry.

320
01:10:29,384 --> 01:10:32,501
I just want to ...

321
01:10:33,304 --> 01:10:35,022
Can we ...?

322
01:10:40,224 --> 01:10:43,614
Get out!

323
01:12:27,904 --> 01:12:32,614
- They're killing everybody.
- I've got to find her.

324
01:12:33,424 --> 01:12:37,383
There's nothing you can do out there.

325
01:12:39,984 --> 01:12:44,102
If I can get this working,
I can listen in.

326
01:12:49,904 --> 01:12:52,293
- Frank...
- What?

327
01:12:52,504 --> 01:12:55,621
- Get set.
- Shit!

328
01:13:01,544 --> 01:13:04,263
- What was that?
- I don't know.

329
01:13:08,864 --> 01:13:14,894
Your wristwatch has malfunctioned.
This entryway will disappear ...

330
01:13:15,104 --> 01:13:18,779
Move! Down there!

331
01:13:19,784 --> 01:13:22,742
Seven seconds.
Six seconds.

332
01:13:27,184 --> 01:13:29,744
Two seconds.
One second.

333
01:13:33,224 --> 01:13:36,341
Ifyou need assistance
in finding your destination, -

334
01:13:36,544 --> 01:13:41,413
- bilingual instructions
are posted in each corridor.

335
01:13:43,504 --> 01:13:47,053
- What language is that?
- I don't know.

336
01:13:47,264 --> 01:13:51,177
- Where are we?
- I think we're under the city.

337
01:13:51,384 --> 01:13:55,218
Some kind of underground base.

338
01:13:55,424 --> 01:14:01,021
- There's got to be a way out.
- I hope nobody saw us drop in.

339
01:14:07,064 --> 01:14:14,379
Operation Steelfist is a success.
We have eliminated the terrorists.

340
01:14:15,264 --> 01:14:18,097
We got 'em!
We wiped 'em out!

341
01:14:18,304 --> 01:14:22,343
It's a win, man.
They got to meet the A-Team.

342
01:14:32,184 --> 01:14:34,744
I'm hearing something.

343
01:14:50,984 --> 01:14:56,377
By the year 2025,
America and the entire planet -

344
01:14:56,584 --> 01:15:01,214
- will be under the protection
ofthis power alliance.

345
01:15:01,424 --> 01:15:08,341
The gains have been substantial for us
and for you, the human power-elite.

346
01:15:18,984 --> 01:15:24,297
You have given us the resources
we need for our expansion.

347
01:15:24,504 --> 01:15:28,497
In return, the per-capita income
of each ofyou has grown.

348
01:15:28,704 --> 01:15:33,573
This year alone,
it's an average 39%/%.

349
01:15:41,944 --> 01:15:45,539
I've received word that our forces
have won a major victory.

350
01:15:45,744 --> 01:15:51,535
The underground terrorist network
has been destroyed.

351
01:15:51,744 --> 01:15:55,657
The situation is normal again.

352
01:15:57,544 --> 01:16:02,413
Hi boys, I didn't know
you'd been recruited.

353
01:16:02,624 --> 01:16:07,254
You should have dressed
for the party now you can afford it.

354
01:16:09,584 --> 01:16:14,783
I'm proud to be here.
Have you seen the whole place?

355
01:16:14,984 --> 01:16:19,899
- I haven't had a chance to.
- I'll show you around.

356
01:16:21,424 --> 01:16:28,216
I knew we had a lot in common
the first time we met.

357
01:16:35,464 --> 01:16:41,061
- Where the hell are we?
- Backstage ofthe show.

358
01:16:41,264 --> 01:16:47,942
This place serves its purpose.
Did you get here using one ofthese?

359
01:16:48,144 --> 01:16:53,935
I know it's only for emergency,
but they're so much fun.

360
01:16:55,584 --> 01:17:01,056
You think that's something,
take a look at this.

361
01:17:01,264 --> 01:17:04,415
- Take a closer look.
- Attention, commuters,

362
01:17:04,624 --> 01:17:09,698
FlightAlpha 7 to Andromeda
is nowready,

363
01:17:09,904 --> 01:17:13,294
That's where they come from.

364
01:17:32,984 --> 01:17:38,422
I don't know how it works.
It's a gravitational lens.

365
01:17:38,624 --> 01:17:44,460
It puts a bend in the light and
you move from place to place.

366
01:17:44,664 --> 01:17:49,135
The whole thing
works like one big airport.

367
01:17:50,944 --> 01:17:57,417
They've got their act together,
believe you me.

368
01:18:07,584 --> 01:18:10,860
Evening, boys. Looking sharp.

369
01:18:11,064 --> 01:18:14,579
Wait till you see
what I'm going to show you now.

370
01:18:23,984 --> 01:18:26,976
Here's the brains ofthe operation.

371
01:18:27,184 --> 01:18:31,496
The signal goes out through
the satellite all over the world.

372
01:18:31,704 --> 01:18:36,380
Pretty fancy.
I'm not too familiar with it.

373
01:18:52,344 --> 01:18:55,893
This is as far as we go.

374
01:19:01,104 --> 01:19:07,498
Can you get us inside? I've never
seen the inside of a TV studio.

375
01:19:07,704 --> 01:19:13,574
- You look like the one to ask.
- I guess it wouldn't be a problem.

376
01:19:13,784 --> 01:19:17,743
Those boys over there
are friends of mine.

377
01:19:17,944 --> 01:19:23,940
My buddies would like the grand tour.
Can we go inside?

378
01:19:24,144 --> 01:19:28,501
Be serious.
Do you have authorization cards?

379
01:19:28,704 --> 01:19:31,059
Right here.

380
01:19:33,544 --> 01:19:35,216
Watch the door.

381
01:19:39,064 --> 01:19:44,058
- Soundproof. Where's that signal?
- Up on the roof.

382
01:19:44,904 --> 01:19:52,413
- If Holly made it, she could help us.
- You're making a big mistake.

383
01:19:52,624 --> 01:19:55,775
- We made the mistake?
- No, listen.

384
01:19:55,984 --> 01:20:01,012
I thought you understood.
It's business, that's all it is.

385
01:20:01,224 --> 01:20:07,379
You still don't get it.
There ain't no countries anymore.

386
01:20:07,584 --> 01:20:11,463
They're running the whole show.
They own the whole planet.

387
01:20:11,664 --> 01:20:16,135
They can do whatever they want.
We can have it good for a change.

388
01:20:16,344 --> 01:20:21,134
Ifwe help them, they'll leave us
alone to make some money.

389
01:20:21,344 --> 01:20:26,623
You can have a taste ofthe good life.
It's what everybody wants.

390
01:20:26,824 --> 01:20:30,976
- You'd do it to your own kind?
- What's the threat?

391
01:20:31,184 --> 01:20:36,099
We all sell out every day,
might as well be on the winning team.

392
01:20:38,504 --> 01:20:40,779
See you, boys.

393
01:20:41,544 --> 01:20:43,580
Let's go.

394
01:20:45,904 --> 01:20:52,218
Was that the two minute break?
We must be running long.

395
01:21:02,344 --> 01:21:05,939
What the hell is going on?

396
01:21:20,744 --> 01:21:22,814
Down!

397
01:21:32,584 --> 01:21:36,782
- Now what?
- Find out where the hell we are.

398
01:21:38,624 --> 01:21:44,221
Excuse me!
Do you know Holly Thompson?

399
01:21:44,424 --> 01:21:48,337
Holly Thompson.
Assistant program ... something.

400
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:53,857
Security alert. Sections Delta
and X-ray report to the fourth floor.

401
01:21:54,064 --> 01:21:56,419
Who's Holly?

402
01:21:58,224 --> 01:22:00,374
Shit!

403
01:22:03,064 --> 01:22:08,821
I hate to interrupt. Could you
tell me how to get to the roof?

404
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:14,701
- How do I get to the roof?
- Turn left at the end ofthe hall.

405
01:22:28,024 --> 01:22:32,893
There's got to be more than one way
to get up there.

406
01:22:34,864 --> 01:22:39,176
Security 950. They're on the move.

407
01:23:18,464 --> 01:23:24,096
- I hear them on the 19th floor.
- We're on the 21st. We've got them.

408
01:23:45,704 --> 01:23:47,057
Holly!

409
01:24:05,024 --> 01:24:07,174
Come on!

410
01:24:07,544 --> 01:24:12,334
Security alert.
Intruders heading for the roof.

411
01:24:44,304 --> 01:24:47,899
Frank! Are you and Holly clear?

412
01:24:48,104 --> 01:24:52,575
I'm clear, are you?

413
01:24:55,144 --> 01:24:57,704
Don't do it.

414
01:25:03,024 --> 01:25:05,857
Don't interfere. You can't win.

415
01:25:15,184 --> 01:25:17,573
Drop your weapon.

416
01:25:19,184 --> 01:25:23,575
Stand away from the dish
or we'll open fire.

417
01:25:23,784 --> 01:25:30,053
- Come inside with me.
- You have ten seconds. Nine ...

418
01:25:30,264 --> 01:25:33,097
Eight. Seven.

419
01:25:34,424 --> 01:25:36,813
Six.

420
01:26:17,424 --> 01:26:21,178
The Oscar winners
give a press conference ,,,

421
01:26:21,384 --> 01:26:26,856
- Gloria, you look like shit,
- Whathappened?

422
01:26:27,304 --> 01:26:31,775
All the sexand violence on the
screen has gone too farforme,

423
01:26:31,984 --> 01:26:38,617
I'm fed up with it, Film makers
have to showsome restraint,,,

424
01:26:51,864 --> 01:26:53,820
What's wrong, baby?
