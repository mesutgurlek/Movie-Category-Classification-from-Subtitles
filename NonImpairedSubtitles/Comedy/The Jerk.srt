1
00:00:49,727 --> 00:00:51,922
I am not a bum.

2
00:00:53,167 --> 00:00:54,600
I'm a jerk.

3
00:00:56,887 --> 00:00:59,003
I once had wealth...

4
00:01:00,007 --> 00:01:01,406
...power...

5
00:01:01,967 --> 00:01:04,925
...and the love of a beautiful woman.

6
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:09,316
Now l only have two things...

7
00:01:10,807 --> 00:01:12,525
...my friends...

8
00:01:13,567 --> 00:01:14,636
...and...

9
00:01:19,847 --> 00:01:21,519
...my thermos.

10
00:01:31,167 --> 00:01:32,725
My story?

11
00:01:41,647 --> 00:01:43,000
Okay.

12
00:01:45,967 --> 00:01:49,198
It was never easy for me.

13
00:01:49,967 --> 00:01:53,562
I was born a poor black child.

14
00:01:55,127 --> 00:01:57,277
I remember the days...

15
00:01:57,527 --> 00:02:00,405
...sitting on the porch with my family...

16
00:02:00,567 --> 00:02:02,000
...singing and dancing...

17
00:02:02,807 --> 00:02:04,604
...down in Mississippi.

18
00:02:11,407 --> 00:02:13,716
-"Oh, lordy
-"Pick a bale of cotton

19
00:02:13,887 --> 00:02:15,957
-"Oh, lordy
-"Pick a bale a day

20
00:02:16,167 --> 00:02:18,203

00:02:18,407 --> 00:02:20,318

00:02:36,727 --> 00:02:38,877

30
00:02:38,967 --> 00:02:41,356
-"Oh, lordy

31
00:02:41,447 --> 00:02:43,358
-"Oh, lordy

32
00:02:43,447 --> 00:02:45,722
-"Oh, lordy

33
00:02:45,887 --> 00:02:48,037
-"Oh, lordy

34
00:02:48,327 --> 00:02:50,477

00:02:50,567 --> 00:02:52,717

38
00:02:57,207 --> 00:02:59,516
-"You want a barebacked man

39
00:02:59,607 --> 00:03:01,757

00:03:01,847 --> 00:03:04,156

41
00:03:04,247 --> 00:03:06,283
-"Jump down, turn around
-"Pick a bale a day"

42
00:03:06,367 --> 00:03:08,278
Boy, l hope everybody's good and hungry.

43
00:03:08,367 --> 00:03:10,961
-I know l am.
-And l'm ready for that.

44
00:03:11,047 --> 00:03:12,526
Here's corn bread.

45
00:03:13,287 --> 00:03:16,484
Collard greens.
And l cooked up those hog maws you like.

46
00:03:16,567 --> 00:03:19,001
Mother, dear,
ain't we forgetting something?

47
00:03:20,007 --> 00:03:23,795
No, l'm not. Today is Navin's birthday.

48
00:03:25,487 --> 00:03:27,000
Happy birthday!.

49
00:03:27,367 --> 00:03:28,720
It's Navin's birthday!.

50
00:03:28,807 --> 00:03:31,719
And l cooked you up your favorite meal.

51
00:03:32,367 --> 00:03:34,927
Tuna fish salad on white bread
with mayonnaise...

52
00:03:35,127 --> 00:03:37,482
...a Tab and a couple of Twinkies.

53
00:03:37,607 --> 00:03:40,519
-Here, darling.
-Mom, thanks.

54
00:03:40,847 --> 00:03:42,917
You're gonna like that shit, man.

55
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,723
I got you a present.

56
00:03:48,487 --> 00:03:50,717
-Gee, Elvira.
-I made it myself.

57
00:03:50,807 --> 00:03:55,801
We got you something, too. A half bottle
of lilac vegetal. It's from both of us.

58
00:03:56,047 --> 00:03:57,958
I drew you this picture.

59
00:03:58,327 --> 00:04:01,125
-Here.
-Thank you.

60
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:03,038
I want you to have my Zippo.

61
00:04:05,847 --> 00:04:09,726
Dad, you had this since the war.

62
00:04:13,007 --> 00:04:14,076
Thanks.

63
00:04:15,527 --> 00:04:17,199
Thanks, everybody.

64
00:04:18,647 --> 00:04:20,160
God bless us...

65
00:04:20,687 --> 00:04:22,245
...everyone.

66
00:04:22,727 --> 00:04:24,046
Navin!.

67
00:04:29,087 --> 00:04:31,885
Will you pass me the potatoes
and the collard greens?

68
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:35,243
-Navin, darling.
-I'm sorry l spoiled the party, Mom.

69
00:04:35,327 --> 00:04:37,761
You didn't spoil the party.

70
00:04:42,447 --> 00:04:43,960
I brought you a Twinkie.

71
00:04:46,647 --> 00:04:48,763
I'm not hungry right now.

72
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,844
Feeling different again?

73
00:04:52,527 --> 00:04:55,564
It's like l don't fit in.
It's like l don't belong here.

74
00:04:56,887 --> 00:04:59,799
It's your birthday, and it's time you knew.

75
00:05:00,807 --> 00:05:03,037
You're not our natural-born child.

76
00:05:08,687 --> 00:05:10,040
I'm not?

77
00:05:11,447 --> 00:05:13,483
You were left on our doorstep...

78
00:05:14,207 --> 00:05:16,926
...but we raised you
like you were one of us.

79
00:05:17,207 --> 00:05:19,880
You mean l'm going to stay this color?

80
00:05:23,487 --> 00:05:27,605
I'd love you if you were the color
of a baboon's ass. Come here.

81
00:05:36,247 --> 00:05:39,956
Navin, l wrapped your sandwich
in cellophane, just like you like it.

82
00:05:41,567 --> 00:05:45,037
You want to come in and sing some blues?

83
00:05:45,767 --> 00:05:47,200
No, thanks, Taj.

84
00:05:47,807 --> 00:05:50,002
There's something about those songs.

85
00:05:50,687 --> 00:05:52,359
They depress me.

86
00:05:53,127 --> 00:05:54,879
Come here, darling.

87
00:06:04,047 --> 00:06:05,639
That's it, darling.

88
00:06:07,647 --> 00:06:09,638
You're getting the rhythm. See?

89
00:06:18,247 --> 00:06:20,886
And that concludes
this Sunday night Gospel Hour...

90
00:06:20,967 --> 00:06:23,037
...live from the
Four Square Gospel Church...

91
00:06:23,127 --> 00:06:26,005
...at the Divine Salvation
in St. Louis, Missouri.

92
00:06:26,087 --> 00:06:28,362
The Reverend Willard Willman, Pastor.

93
00:06:28,447 --> 00:06:30,597
And now, music throughout the night.

94
00:06:30,687 --> 00:06:32,643
Music in a mellow mood.

95
00:07:44,607 --> 00:07:47,041
-Grandma!.
-What happened?

96
00:07:47,847 --> 00:07:49,280
-Look!.
-What happened?

97
00:07:49,367 --> 00:07:51,642
Don't touch that radio!. Don't touch it!.

98
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:53,599
Turn it up!. Turn it up!.

99
00:07:54,287 --> 00:07:56,676
I've never heard music like this before!.

100
00:07:56,887 --> 00:07:59,640
It speaks to me!. Taj!. Dad!.

101
00:07:59,727 --> 00:08:02,525
This is unbelievable. Now watch.

102
00:08:05,687 --> 00:08:06,722
Yeah?

103
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:11,636
Well, if this is out there,
think how much more is out there!.

104
00:08:11,727 --> 00:08:15,845
This is the kind of music that tells me
to go out there and be somebody!.

105
00:08:17,327 --> 00:08:19,283
-But Navin--
-Let him go.

106
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:31,640
Now that you're going out into the world...

107
00:08:31,727 --> 00:08:33,604
...there's something you should know.

108
00:08:34,967 --> 00:08:37,083
-You see that?
-Yeah.

109
00:08:37,287 --> 00:08:38,800
That's shit.

110
00:08:40,047 --> 00:08:43,084
And this is Shinola.

111
00:08:45,607 --> 00:08:46,801
Shit.

112
00:08:48,167 --> 00:08:49,520
Shinola.

113
00:08:49,687 --> 00:08:51,803
Son, you're gonna be all right.

114
00:08:52,567 --> 00:08:55,400
Now, what town
are you gonna try for first?

115
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:59,561
I thought l'd go to St. Louis 'cause
that's where that radio show was from.

116
00:08:59,807 --> 00:09:03,436
And remember,
the Lord loves a working man.

117
00:09:03,527 --> 00:09:05,563
-"Lord loves a working man."
-And son...

118
00:09:05,687 --> 00:09:08,155
...don't never, ever trust Whitey.

119
00:09:08,327 --> 00:09:11,717
"Don't trust Whitey. Lord loves
a working man, don't trust Whitey."

120
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,955
Baby.

121
00:09:16,127 --> 00:09:17,242
Daddy.

122
00:09:19,807 --> 00:09:21,877
Pierre. Come here.

123
00:09:22,527 --> 00:09:24,245
Don't you forget to grow up now.

124
00:09:24,327 --> 00:09:26,921
-Good luck, brother.
-Send me a picture postcard.

125
00:09:28,807 --> 00:09:31,082
Okay, let the boy go.

126
00:09:31,207 --> 00:09:33,721
-Bye.
-We got work to do.

127
00:09:34,167 --> 00:09:37,443
And l hope you find
whatever it is you're looking for.

128
00:09:39,647 --> 00:09:42,719
I will, Ma. I know it's out there.

129
00:09:42,847 --> 00:09:46,442
It's out there, all right. If you catch it,
see a doctor and get rid of it.

130
00:09:46,607 --> 00:09:48,723
-"See a doctor and get rid of it."
-Good luck.

131
00:09:48,807 --> 00:09:51,367
"Lord loves a working man.
Don't trust Whitey.

132
00:09:51,447 --> 00:09:53,563
"See a doctor and get rid of it."

133
00:09:54,567 --> 00:09:56,080
Bye, Grandma!.

134
00:10:09,727 --> 00:10:12,195
I sure do miss Navin.

135
00:10:13,927 --> 00:10:15,804
Is he ever coming back?

136
00:10:16,687 --> 00:10:20,646
Take away his place setting.
It's making us too goddamn sad.

137
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:27,243
I wonder if he's doing all right?

138
00:10:28,167 --> 00:10:30,601
Navin!. How you doing?

139
00:10:30,687 --> 00:10:34,157
Don't worry about me.
I think l see a car coming.

140
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,439
No, wait. It's a truck!.

141
00:10:38,327 --> 00:10:39,840
Lord...

142
00:10:40,327 --> 00:10:42,204
...take care of our little boy.

143
00:10:47,767 --> 00:10:50,156
-I'm hitchhiking.
-How far you going?

144
00:10:50,247 --> 00:10:52,556
St. Louis. How far are you going?

145
00:10:52,807 --> 00:10:54,957
To the end of this fence.

146
00:10:55,807 --> 00:10:57,001
Okay.

147
00:11:01,007 --> 00:11:03,805
I'm Navin Johnson. What's your name, sir?

148
00:11:03,887 --> 00:11:06,640
-Here we are.
-Okay.

149
00:11:12,127 --> 00:11:14,038
Thanks for the company.

150
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:17,405
I hope l can repay you someday.

151
00:12:07,207 --> 00:12:09,038
Well, what is it, boy? Are you lost?

152
00:12:09,847 --> 00:12:12,884
Do you want to play? ls it trouble?

153
00:12:15,327 --> 00:12:16,521
Trouble?

154
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:19,239
Is it an accident?

155
00:12:19,407 --> 00:12:20,726
A drowning?

156
00:12:21,287 --> 00:12:22,686
A fire?

157
00:12:23,087 --> 00:12:24,486
Fire!.

158
00:12:27,887 --> 00:12:30,037
We've got to warn everybody!.

159
00:12:30,127 --> 00:12:33,563
I've heard about dogs like you.
You're going to be famous!.

160
00:12:34,047 --> 00:12:37,756
You're going to get your picture taken,
and they'll put it in the paper!.

161
00:12:38,127 --> 00:12:39,401
This is exciting!.

162
00:12:39,487 --> 00:12:43,321
You saved my life!.
Come on, let's warn everybody!.

163
00:12:45,687 --> 00:12:48,520
Fire!. It's a fire!. Fire!. There's a fire!.

164
00:12:48,607 --> 00:12:51,565
Everybody!. Up!. Wake up!. It's a fire!.

165
00:12:51,647 --> 00:12:54,559
It's a fire!.
This dog, he's saving everybody's life!.

166
00:12:54,647 --> 00:12:58,003
He's unbelievable!. He's some dog!.
He's a lifesaver!.

167
00:12:58,087 --> 00:13:02,444
That's what l'll call him, too!.
Ol' Lifesaver!. That will be your name!.

168
00:13:05,607 --> 00:13:09,043
Folks!. False alarm. There's no fire.

169
00:13:10,727 --> 00:13:13,719
Mister, don't call that dog "Lifesaver."

170
00:13:13,807 --> 00:13:16,879
-No?
-Call him "Shithead."

171
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,476
Good. "Shithead."

172
00:13:20,247 --> 00:13:21,726
It's exciting.

173
00:13:22,487 --> 00:13:26,116
It's just exciting to have
this kind of life on the road.

174
00:13:26,327 --> 00:13:28,045
A guy and his dog.

175
00:13:31,967 --> 00:13:33,525
St. Louis?

176
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:35,558
No. Navin Johnson.

177
00:13:35,687 --> 00:13:37,996
No, do you want a lift to St. Louis?

178
00:13:38,247 --> 00:13:40,602
-Okay, thanks.
-Hop in.

179
00:13:43,567 --> 00:13:45,762
This'll be fine right here.

180
00:13:54,807 --> 00:13:56,445
Thank you.

181
00:13:58,287 --> 00:14:00,642
-Where you going?
-To the bathroom.

182
00:14:00,767 --> 00:14:03,361
-Got to have a key.
-Can l get one?

183
00:14:03,447 --> 00:14:06,166
My key is for customers who buy gas.

184
00:14:07,407 --> 00:14:08,726
I'm buying gas.

185
00:14:08,927 --> 00:14:10,724
I don't see no car.

186
00:14:10,927 --> 00:14:13,395
I just need enough for my lighter.

187
00:14:13,487 --> 00:14:14,363
Look at this!.

188
00:14:14,447 --> 00:14:17,484
And my wife wanted me to stay home.
Look what l would've missed.

189
00:14:17,567 --> 00:14:19,797
A complete fill-up for a whole lighter?

190
00:14:19,887 --> 00:14:22,276
-It's on that wall.
-Thank you.

191
00:14:30,407 --> 00:14:32,967
-And don't walk away with it.
-I won't.

192
00:14:34,687 --> 00:14:35,915
Pop-top.

193
00:14:36,087 --> 00:14:38,237
Silver Bird, l'm talking to you!.

194
00:14:39,007 --> 00:14:41,646
Listen, you want to be
president of Texaco Oil?

195
00:14:42,487 --> 00:14:45,081
-Sure!.
-Then clean up the sink in there.

196
00:14:46,807 --> 00:14:49,446
Then l'll be president of Texaco Oil?

197
00:14:49,967 --> 00:14:51,923
Whatever happened
to working your way up?

198
00:14:52,007 --> 00:14:55,795
Working for me 10 minutes, and already
he wants to be president. The nerve.

199
00:14:56,527 --> 00:14:58,040
Get to work in there!.

200
00:14:58,127 --> 00:15:00,322
But, sir, l don't work here.

201
00:15:00,727 --> 00:15:02,399
Not even for $1 .10 an hour?

202
00:15:27,447 --> 00:15:30,757
"Dear Folks, l got this greatjob
in a gas station.

203
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:32,838
"l don't want to say
how much l'm getting...

204
00:15:32,927 --> 00:15:35,077
"...but let'sjust say it's a lot!

205
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,123
"l'm enclosing $2!"

206
00:15:37,207 --> 00:15:39,323
That's a good boy!.

207
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:42,844
"lt's a lot of fun working,
and Mr. Hartounian is really nice.

208
00:15:43,007 --> 00:15:45,123
"He's teaching me how to be impatient.

209
00:15:46,407 --> 00:15:51,037
"Well, l've got to go now. What do you
think l do, write letters all day?"

210
00:15:53,407 --> 00:15:56,240
-You actually sleep here?
-Yes. Is that okay?

211
00:15:57,567 --> 00:16:00,081
Come with me.
I got a beautiful little place for you.

212
00:16:00,687 --> 00:16:03,599
Put the light on.
You're going to like it here.

213
00:16:04,887 --> 00:16:09,403
Like it? l love it!. This is fabulous!.

214
00:16:10,447 --> 00:16:12,324
You got the toilet here!.

215
00:16:12,447 --> 00:16:15,007
This must be the kitchen. No.

216
00:16:16,527 --> 00:16:17,926
You know what l could do...

217
00:16:18,007 --> 00:16:20,396
...is take this wall
and just turn it this way...

218
00:16:20,487 --> 00:16:22,523
...so l've got a larger living space...

219
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:26,361
...plus it'll create a flow into
the main living area. It'll be incredible.

220
00:16:26,447 --> 00:16:28,756
No, l'll just elevate this about six inches...

221
00:16:28,847 --> 00:16:32,442
...create the illusion of two rooms,
and yet still have that flow.

222
00:16:32,527 --> 00:16:35,121
Then l can take bookshelves
and put it here.

223
00:16:35,647 --> 00:16:39,401
No, l'll put the books right over here.
That way l can be relaxing over here...

224
00:16:39,487 --> 00:16:43,366
...the customers can use the urinal. I won't
disturb them, they won't disturb me.

225
00:16:43,447 --> 00:16:46,120
Take it easy. It's not here. It's in here.

226
00:16:48,527 --> 00:16:50,757
I couldn't afford this anyway.

227
00:16:50,967 --> 00:16:52,605
Well, this is it.

228
00:16:54,047 --> 00:16:55,366
It's perfect!.

229
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:57,483
I won't have to change this at all!.

230
00:16:57,607 --> 00:16:58,835
Take a look.

231
00:16:59,087 --> 00:17:02,045
No kitchen, no windows,
no chairs, no tables.

232
00:17:02,167 --> 00:17:04,123
It's a masterpiece of understatement.

233
00:17:04,367 --> 00:17:08,724
I'll put a bed down here, get a bigger bulb.
I'll bring some sheets from the house.

234
00:17:08,807 --> 00:17:10,445
You'll be set for life.

235
00:17:12,527 --> 00:17:14,995
How much is this gonna cost me?

236
00:17:15,087 --> 00:17:18,204
Nothing. When you're rich and famous,
you'll send me a postcard.

237
00:17:20,407 --> 00:17:21,965
A postcard?

238
00:17:27,967 --> 00:17:30,322
Okay!. It's a deal.

239
00:17:31,167 --> 00:17:32,395
It's a deal.

240
00:17:34,327 --> 00:17:35,601
What are those?

241
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:37,723
Step outside for a second, darling.

242
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:40,845
Navin, this is my wife Lenore.
Lenore, this is Navin.

243
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:42,521
Pleased to meet you.

244
00:17:42,647 --> 00:17:45,878
Do you know why a woman
of such pulchritude is married to me?

245
00:17:46,007 --> 00:17:47,725
'Cause l make a comfortable living.

246
00:17:47,807 --> 00:17:50,560
This is the first time
l'm leaving you alone on a Sunday.

247
00:17:50,647 --> 00:17:54,356
If anything should happen to this station,
this woman would leave me like a--

248
00:17:56,487 --> 00:17:58,762
In other words, there would be no more....

249
00:17:59,407 --> 00:18:02,444
-Do you know what l'm talking about?
-Yes, sir. No more....

250
00:18:04,407 --> 00:18:07,240
So remember,
guard this station with your life...

251
00:18:07,367 --> 00:18:10,006
...because my sex life is in your hands.

252
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:22,885
I can fix those shocks.

253
00:18:22,967 --> 00:18:26,357
No. We just want some gas, muchacho.

254
00:18:26,447 --> 00:18:29,405
Okay. But it's Sunday.
We've got to have a credit card.

255
00:18:30,327 --> 00:18:32,238
And all the cash is locked up?

256
00:18:32,327 --> 00:18:36,286
No, not locked up. We got a lot of cash.
Just that the banks are closed...

257
00:18:36,367 --> 00:18:38,961
...and l'm not allowed to have cash
coming in or out.

258
00:18:39,047 --> 00:18:41,925
I'm alone for the first time.
I don't want anything to happen.

259
00:18:42,007 --> 00:18:45,920
You flash this kind of wad in front
of some people, they'll kill you for it.

260
00:18:46,007 --> 00:18:47,804
So, we've got to have a credit card.

261
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:51,166
Have we got a credit card in there?

262
00:18:51,327 --> 00:18:53,158
Credit card.

263
00:18:59,647 --> 00:19:01,285
No, thanks. I don't smoke.

264
00:19:01,447 --> 00:19:03,881
-What kind of cigarette is that?
-Joint.

265
00:19:04,047 --> 00:19:05,036
Joint?

266
00:19:05,487 --> 00:19:06,886
They don't make 'em very good.

267
00:19:06,967 --> 00:19:10,277
-MasterCharge do?
-That's fine. We take MasterCharge.

268
00:19:10,527 --> 00:19:14,042
You want a fill-up, Mrs. Nussbaum?

269
00:19:15,887 --> 00:19:17,684
I'm Mr. Nussbaum.

270
00:19:17,967 --> 00:19:20,276
Yeah, that's his wife's card.

271
00:19:20,407 --> 00:19:23,444
-His wife's card?
-Yeah, l'll vouch for him.

272
00:19:23,527 --> 00:19:25,722
Okay, as long as we got a voucher.

273
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:38,406
Stolen!.

274
00:19:58,767 --> 00:20:01,361
I got it!. Just send a police car over.

275
00:20:02,047 --> 00:20:05,722
Mrs. Nussbaum's credit card!.
I got the guys who stole it.

276
00:20:07,567 --> 00:20:09,876
Hold on, they're calling me!.
I'll be right back!.

277
00:20:14,687 --> 00:20:17,918
-Yes?
-Yeah, throw a couple of tires in the trunk.

278
00:20:18,887 --> 00:20:20,479
Put it on the card. Radials.

279
00:20:20,567 --> 00:20:24,196
-Make them whitewalls.
-Yes, sir, Mr. Nussbaum.

280
00:20:30,807 --> 00:20:32,877
I'm back, only it's worse than l thought.

281
00:20:32,967 --> 00:20:36,755
They're not only sticking us for gas,
but grabbing tires and everything.

282
00:20:36,847 --> 00:20:38,485
They're really socking it to us.

283
00:20:38,567 --> 00:20:41,286
Yeah, it's Hartounian's Gas Station
at the corner--

284
00:20:41,367 --> 00:20:43,961
Hang on a second.
I don't want to get 'em suspicious.

285
00:20:45,927 --> 00:20:49,203
Don't worry, l can keep 'em here.
I saw this trick in a movie.

286
00:20:53,167 --> 00:20:55,727
-Got your tires!.
-Yeah, good.

287
00:21:37,887 --> 00:21:39,559
-Anything else?
-Yeah.

288
00:21:39,647 --> 00:21:42,639
We'll take that money
you got in your pocket.

289
00:21:43,647 --> 00:21:45,877
Sure. I'll just put it on the card.

290
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:50,765
Guess what!.
You're our eighth customer today!.

291
00:21:50,887 --> 00:21:53,606
You won a free oven mitt!.

292
00:21:53,887 --> 00:21:55,957
I'll go get it for you.

293
00:22:09,847 --> 00:22:11,519
Yeah, l'm back.

294
00:22:13,247 --> 00:22:16,683
Yeah, they're gonna be here for a while.
Don't worry. I've rigged it.

295
00:22:17,327 --> 00:22:20,239
You guys want to stick around
for an oven mitt?

296
00:22:26,087 --> 00:22:27,566
Hang on just a second.

297
00:22:53,127 --> 00:22:57,006
They might not be here
exactly when you get back but...

298
00:22:57,727 --> 00:23:00,878
...it's a blue Chevy two-door.

299
00:23:01,287 --> 00:23:04,836
And it'd be going south on Hertado Street.

300
00:23:05,127 --> 00:23:08,039
No, l can't make out
the license number, but...

301
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,037
...it'd be pulling a small church.

302
00:23:11,647 --> 00:23:16,323
Any blue Chevy pulling a small church
l figure that'd be the one, yeah.

303
00:23:17,247 --> 00:23:19,602
Believe me, l'm not mad at you.

304
00:23:19,887 --> 00:23:22,845
What's the matter with you?
What did l lose, a couple of tires?

305
00:23:25,367 --> 00:23:28,120
Look at the bright side.
We also lost a church.

306
00:23:28,727 --> 00:23:30,683
Mr. Hartounian.

307
00:23:36,007 --> 00:23:37,963
Oh, my God!.

308
00:23:39,847 --> 00:23:41,200
Thank you.

309
00:23:49,607 --> 00:23:52,280
The new phone book's here!.

310
00:23:52,367 --> 00:23:54,562
I wish l could get that excited
about nothing.

311
00:23:54,647 --> 00:23:57,320
Nothing? Are you kidding? Page 73!.

312
00:23:57,487 --> 00:24:00,399
"Johnson, Navin R."

313
00:24:00,967 --> 00:24:05,119
I'm somebody now!. Millions of people
look at this book every day!.

314
00:24:05,247 --> 00:24:07,522
This is the kind of spontaneous publicity...

315
00:24:07,607 --> 00:24:10,758
...your name in print, that makes people!.

316
00:24:11,727 --> 00:24:13,399
I'm in print!.

317
00:24:14,767 --> 00:24:18,123
Things are going to start happening
to me now.

318
00:24:21,407 --> 00:24:23,398
"Johnson, Navin R."

319
00:24:23,487 --> 00:24:25,557
Sounds like a typical bastard.

320
00:24:29,327 --> 00:24:31,966
Die, Navin R. Johnson.

321
00:24:35,247 --> 00:24:36,316
Bastard!.

322
00:24:36,407 --> 00:24:39,717
Random son of a bitch,
typical run-of-the-mill bastard.

323
00:24:40,447 --> 00:24:42,881
-Fill 'er up?
-Fill 'er up and a little bit extra.

324
00:24:42,967 --> 00:24:46,357
-Stan Fox, buying gas.
-Navin R. Johnson selling it, sir!.

325
00:24:46,767 --> 00:24:49,042
Gotcha, you average...

326
00:24:49,207 --> 00:24:53,485
...typical blocking-the-view-
of-a-goddamn-average-victim bastard!.

327
00:24:53,847 --> 00:24:56,680
-Check your oil?
-Check away, Navin R. Johnson.

328
00:24:56,767 --> 00:24:58,200
Oil rag at the ready, sir!.

329
00:24:58,287 --> 00:25:00,562
-Let's check the oil together.
-Yes, sir.

330
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:02,197
Thank you.

331
00:25:05,167 --> 00:25:06,486
Son-of-a-blocking bastard!.

332
00:25:07,447 --> 00:25:10,041
Looks good to me, sir,
but l'd like your opinion.

333
00:25:10,247 --> 00:25:11,680
Damn these glasses.

334
00:25:11,807 --> 00:25:14,480
It looks good to me, too.
Hurry up. Time's a wasting.

335
00:25:14,567 --> 00:25:18,480
I'm going to the john. Don't forget
to check those tires. Damn these glasses.

336
00:25:18,567 --> 00:25:21,161
Yes, sir!. I damn thee!.

337
00:25:22,247 --> 00:25:23,600
Damn!.

338
00:25:27,767 --> 00:25:29,917
Damn these glasses!.

339
00:25:31,087 --> 00:25:33,282
-I can fix those glasses.
-You can?

340
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:35,443
Well, here, fix those suckers!.

341
00:25:46,287 --> 00:25:47,322
Shit!.

342
00:26:06,207 --> 00:26:08,562
Guess what? l fixed 'em.

343
00:26:10,047 --> 00:26:11,560
I was back there thinking...

344
00:26:11,647 --> 00:26:14,684
..."What causes glasses to slip on and off?. "

345
00:26:14,767 --> 00:26:17,201
And it's because
when you take them on and off...

346
00:26:17,327 --> 00:26:19,397
...you're putting pressure on the frames.

347
00:26:19,487 --> 00:26:21,000
It causes them to spread.

348
00:26:21,127 --> 00:26:24,244
So l put a little handle
right here in the center...

349
00:26:24,367 --> 00:26:26,642
...that puts the pressure on the bridge.

350
00:26:26,727 --> 00:26:28,797
Just like the tie rods on a '72 Buick.

351
00:26:28,967 --> 00:26:32,801
Plus, l put a little nose brake on here
to prevent slippage. Try it.

352
00:26:33,447 --> 00:26:34,846
Use the handle.

353
00:26:38,127 --> 00:26:39,196
Well, l'll be.

354
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:41,643
It works.

355
00:26:43,607 --> 00:26:47,236
I make a pretty good living
selling shit like this. I'll tell you what.

356
00:26:47,327 --> 00:26:50,683
If l can develop this gizmo,
l'll split it with you fifty-fifty.

357
00:26:51,127 --> 00:26:53,482
How much for the gas?
l got a load of shit to sell.

358
00:26:53,567 --> 00:26:56,320
-$26.41 .
-Here's a triple dix. Keep the change.

359
00:26:56,807 --> 00:26:58,206
Thanks!.

360
00:27:01,407 --> 00:27:04,717
Dead center!. Say your prayers, half-breed!.

361
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:16,481
Harry!. Look at this!.

362
00:27:17,087 --> 00:27:19,555
What's the matter with these cans?

363
00:27:20,287 --> 00:27:22,118
Die, milk-face!.

364
00:27:25,327 --> 00:27:28,239
These cans are defective.
They're springing leaks.

365
00:27:28,367 --> 00:27:29,766
Come and look at this.

366
00:27:31,007 --> 00:27:33,726
You better run for cover
or you'll spring a leak.

367
00:27:34,087 --> 00:27:36,760
We don't have defective cans.
We have a defective person!.

368
00:27:39,887 --> 00:27:41,798
He hates these cans.

369
00:27:43,167 --> 00:27:44,964
Stay away from the cans!.

370
00:27:45,167 --> 00:27:46,964
Die, gas pumper!.

371
00:27:47,967 --> 00:27:50,356
I've got to get away from those cans!.

372
00:27:50,527 --> 00:27:52,404
There's cans in there, too!.

373
00:27:52,487 --> 00:27:53,761
Run!. Run!.

374
00:27:56,567 --> 00:27:57,966
More cans!.

375
00:27:58,767 --> 00:28:00,325
Die, you bastard!.

376
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:06,157
He doesn't want to put holes in cans.
He wants to put holes in you.

377
00:28:06,247 --> 00:28:07,646
What?

378
00:28:10,487 --> 00:28:12,364
Milk-faced bastard!.

379
00:28:13,647 --> 00:28:15,797
Oh, my God!. I'm endangering your life!.

380
00:28:15,887 --> 00:28:17,639
-Cover me!.
-You're covered.

381
00:28:18,367 --> 00:28:20,039
Suck my toes!.

382
00:28:24,687 --> 00:28:27,076
You stay here!. I'll distract him!.

383
00:28:41,647 --> 00:28:43,842
Shithead!. Come on!.

384
00:28:45,847 --> 00:28:48,156
Come on, boy!. Good boy!.

385
00:29:16,767 --> 00:29:19,645
"Carnival personnel only." Damn!.

386
00:29:24,127 --> 00:29:25,526
Shithead, come on!.

387
00:29:26,167 --> 00:29:28,123
You're not carnival personnel!.

388
00:29:32,847 --> 00:29:35,441
He's not carnival personnel!.

389
00:29:37,167 --> 00:29:38,919
Okay, move it out!.

390
00:29:44,687 --> 00:29:48,043
"So, Mom, when l told Mr. Hartounian
l'd come back, he said:

391
00:29:48,207 --> 00:29:49,560
"'Don't be a putz.

392
00:29:49,727 --> 00:29:52,082
"'See the world. Me you've seen already.'

393
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:56,564
"l took his advice and got a job with
SJM Fiesta Shows as a weight guesser.

394
00:29:56,727 --> 00:30:00,197
"Frosty, my boss, told me
there's a big future in weight guessing.

395
00:30:00,447 --> 00:30:04,281
"Enclosed is $4.75 for my loving family.

396
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:07,560
"P.S. Is grandma still farting?"

397
00:30:07,767 --> 00:30:12,204
For $1, l'll guess your weight,
your height or your sex.

398
00:30:12,487 --> 00:30:15,001
The most exciting thing on the midway.

399
00:30:15,087 --> 00:30:19,319
Imagine the thrill of getting
your weight guessed by a professional.

400
00:30:19,647 --> 00:30:22,445
You can blow up your cheeks,
you can stick out your chest...

401
00:30:22,527 --> 00:30:24,995
...but you're not going to fool the guesser!.

402
00:30:25,087 --> 00:30:27,203
How 'bout you, sir? Step right up!.

403
00:30:27,287 --> 00:30:30,882
Honey, let's see how good this guy is.
Now, what do l win?

404
00:30:31,967 --> 00:30:35,596
Anything in this general area right in here.

405
00:30:35,687 --> 00:30:39,760
Anything below the stereo and
on this side of the bicentennial glasses.

406
00:30:39,847 --> 00:30:43,601
Anything between the ashtrays
and the thimble.

407
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:47,926
Anything in this three inches
right in here, in this area.

408
00:30:48,007 --> 00:30:50,646
That includes the Chiclets,
but not the erasers.

409
00:30:50,727 --> 00:30:52,479
No, sir!. Come on, honey.

410
00:30:52,567 --> 00:30:54,762
He thought he had himself a rube.

411
00:30:57,447 --> 00:30:59,756
Frosty, l'm no good at this.

412
00:30:59,847 --> 00:31:01,678
Come on. You're doing fine.

413
00:31:01,807 --> 00:31:05,595
I've already given away eight pencils,
two hula dolls and an ashtray...

414
00:31:05,687 --> 00:31:07,723
...and l've only taken in $15.

415
00:31:08,087 --> 00:31:10,726
Navin, you have taken in $15...

416
00:31:10,847 --> 00:31:13,441
...and given away 50 cents worth of crap!.

417
00:31:14,047 --> 00:31:17,198
Which gives us a net profit of $14.50.

418
00:31:22,727 --> 00:31:25,036
It's a profit deal.

419
00:31:27,727 --> 00:31:29,877
Takes the pressure off.

420
00:31:30,687 --> 00:31:33,565
Get your weight guessed right here!.
Only a buck!.

421
00:31:33,647 --> 00:31:38,038
Actual weight guessing!. Take a chance,
win some crap. Step right up--

422
00:31:38,127 --> 00:31:40,595
Ladies and gentlemen...

423
00:31:40,807 --> 00:31:45,278
...l draw your attention now
to the left side ofthe midway.

424
00:31:45,607 --> 00:31:49,964
Presenting the amazing Patti Bernstein...

425
00:31:50,887 --> 00:31:53,242
...doing her special ride...

426
00:31:53,367 --> 00:31:56,359
...through the Flaming Wall of Death!

427
00:32:58,927 --> 00:33:00,918
Want to guess my weight, Greenie?

428
00:33:01,207 --> 00:33:03,767
I saw you last night. You were great.

429
00:33:03,927 --> 00:33:06,157
Yeah, right. Turn around.

430
00:33:06,927 --> 00:33:08,076
What?

431
00:33:08,247 --> 00:33:09,805
Turn around.

432
00:33:11,927 --> 00:33:13,246
Go like this.

433
00:33:17,087 --> 00:33:20,284
You're okay.
Give me a bite of that corn dog.

434
00:33:20,687 --> 00:33:22,564
What about germs?

435
00:33:23,407 --> 00:33:25,238
Put a rubber on it.

436
00:33:27,807 --> 00:33:29,126
Get on.

437
00:33:35,647 --> 00:33:37,877
Don't you wear him out!.
He's got to work tonight.

438
00:33:44,447 --> 00:33:46,005
What a great place!.

439
00:33:49,367 --> 00:33:52,803
You know, you can tell so much
about a person from the way they live.

440
00:33:52,887 --> 00:33:54,878
Just looking around here, l can tell...

441
00:33:54,967 --> 00:33:57,606
...you're a genuinely dirty person.

442
00:34:01,407 --> 00:34:02,726
What do l do with this?

443
00:34:06,087 --> 00:34:07,805
You keep it there.

444
00:34:11,807 --> 00:34:13,286
Where's your garbage?

445
00:34:16,727 --> 00:34:17,796
There.

446
00:34:21,767 --> 00:34:24,281
-Do you know what l'd like to do?
-What?

447
00:34:25,567 --> 00:34:27,046
Guess your weight.

448
00:34:27,127 --> 00:34:28,765
That would be interesting for me.

449
00:34:28,847 --> 00:34:31,042
No one has tried to guess my weight.

450
00:34:31,127 --> 00:34:34,119
-I guess their weight so it would be sort--
-Put your arms up.

451
00:34:36,607 --> 00:34:39,326
This will give me
a whole different perspective on this.

452
00:34:44,127 --> 00:34:46,561
You're really trying to be accurate.

453
00:34:52,167 --> 00:34:54,078
Is it getting hot in here?

454
00:34:55,127 --> 00:34:56,924
Wait a minute!.

455
00:34:57,167 --> 00:34:59,556
What's happening to my special purpose?

456
00:34:59,647 --> 00:35:01,126
What's your special purpose?

457
00:35:01,207 --> 00:35:04,279
When l was a kid, my mom told me
that was my special purpose...

458
00:35:04,367 --> 00:35:07,200
...and someday l'd find out
what that special purpose was!.

459
00:35:07,287 --> 00:35:09,039
Today's the day!.

460
00:35:14,527 --> 00:35:16,404
This is like a ride!.

461
00:35:18,007 --> 00:35:21,556
"My dear family, guess what?

462
00:35:22,207 --> 00:35:27,406
"Today l found out
what my special purpose is for.

463
00:35:28,687 --> 00:35:31,599
"Gosh, what a great time l had.

464
00:35:31,927 --> 00:35:35,715
"l wish the whole family
could have been here with me.

465
00:35:36,287 --> 00:35:38,755
"Maybe some other time...

466
00:35:39,207 --> 00:35:42,244
"...as l intend to do this a lot...

467
00:35:42,967 --> 00:35:45,242
"...every chance l get.

468
00:35:45,847 --> 00:35:49,123
"l think next week
l'll be able to send more money...

469
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:51,761
"...as l may have extra work.

470
00:35:52,007 --> 00:35:55,124
"My friend Patti promised me a blow job.

471
00:35:55,207 --> 00:35:57,198
"Your loving son, Navin."

472
00:35:57,527 --> 00:35:59,961
And he's got the kisses here.

473
00:36:01,927 --> 00:36:05,806
-That Patti must be a sweet girl.
-God bless her.

474
00:36:31,887 --> 00:36:36,039
Do you think we'll get to know each other
well enough to kiss?

475
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:38,516
We don't have to. You're my man.

476
00:36:38,687 --> 00:36:41,485
It's like we're married. Look at my ass.

477
00:36:43,807 --> 00:36:47,322
You have my last name tattooed
right there under the J's.

478
00:36:48,207 --> 00:36:52,166
First l get my name in the phone book,
and now l'm on your ass.

479
00:36:52,487 --> 00:36:56,366
You know, l'll bet more people
see that than the phone book.

480
00:37:08,967 --> 00:37:10,241
End of the line.

481
00:37:10,327 --> 00:37:13,717
This is Engineer Fred.
Come back and visit me again.

482
00:37:17,687 --> 00:37:19,006
Billy!.

483
00:37:25,367 --> 00:37:29,838
Have you seen a 5-year-old boy, blond hair,
wearing a T-shirt that says "bullshit" on it?

484
00:37:29,967 --> 00:37:34,199
No, there was just one kid had a T-shirt
that said "life sucks" on it.

485
00:37:34,487 --> 00:37:37,843
We got off the Round-Up,
and he said he wanted to go on the train.

486
00:37:37,927 --> 00:37:39,599
There he is!. Billy!.

487
00:37:39,687 --> 00:37:41,439
-Come back here!.
-Get off the train.

488
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:43,963
Pull that lever!. Pull the lever!.

489
00:37:44,047 --> 00:37:46,641
Here, hold that!. And these!.

490
00:37:47,887 --> 00:37:51,960
Take my keys. And hold my wallet. Okay.

491
00:37:52,647 --> 00:37:55,480
Don't touch the Johnson bar,
you'll explode the fuel casing!.

492
00:37:55,567 --> 00:37:58,559
And if the Wolfe and Smith
indicator gets above 160...

493
00:37:58,647 --> 00:38:01,400
-...turn that off there.
-I can't take you here anymore.

494
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:04,479
There's a screwdriver.
Put it in, turn it one quarter.

495
00:38:04,727 --> 00:38:06,524
Listen, we're going into a tunnel.

496
00:38:06,607 --> 00:38:09,167
Don't stand up.
The clearance is only 4 foot--

497
00:38:09,807 --> 00:38:11,479
-No.
-I'm okay.

498
00:38:11,567 --> 00:38:14,365
I was protected by the bill
of my Engineer Fred cap.

499
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:31,882
Thanks for pulling my cap down.

500
00:38:35,687 --> 00:38:38,838
You scared me half to death.
Thank you so much.

501
00:38:39,007 --> 00:38:41,760
It would've been so embarrassing
to go home without Billy.

502
00:38:41,887 --> 00:38:47,086
Here's your gloves
and your oil can and your wallet.

503
00:38:47,767 --> 00:38:49,280
And this fell out.

504
00:38:52,167 --> 00:38:53,725
Those guys!.

505
00:38:53,967 --> 00:38:57,960
Listen, what you did just now
was very brave.

506
00:38:58,247 --> 00:39:00,442
Is there some way l could repay you?

507
00:39:00,727 --> 00:39:02,001
Repay me?

508
00:39:02,087 --> 00:39:05,204
I could never accept anything from you
for saving your child.

509
00:39:05,287 --> 00:39:09,519
He's not my child.
I'm just baby-sitting for a friend.

510
00:39:10,047 --> 00:39:13,926
-Would it be too much if l asked for a kiss?
-No.

511
00:39:16,647 --> 00:39:18,399
He's a real little dickens.

512
00:39:26,967 --> 00:39:28,286
Thank you.

513
00:39:32,687 --> 00:39:33,836
Miss?

514
00:39:35,047 --> 00:39:38,005
I was just standing here right now,
and l was...

515
00:39:38,207 --> 00:39:41,199
...wondering, if you weren't
doing anything tomorrow...

516
00:39:43,567 --> 00:39:47,640
...maybe you might want to go out with....

517
00:39:48,207 --> 00:39:49,401
What?

518
00:39:50,727 --> 00:39:55,278
I thought maybe you might
want to go out with me.

519
00:39:55,767 --> 00:39:57,997
Are you trying to ask me for a date?

520
00:40:01,007 --> 00:40:04,477
Once for no, twice for yes.

521
00:40:07,367 --> 00:40:08,686
Okay.

522
00:40:10,567 --> 00:40:12,125
You're so cute.

523
00:40:12,247 --> 00:40:15,637
How about 3:30 tomorrow
at the Round-Up?

524
00:40:15,727 --> 00:40:17,285
Okay.

525
00:40:19,847 --> 00:40:21,838
Do you have any boyfriends?

526
00:40:23,527 --> 00:40:24,676
Not really.

527
00:40:24,767 --> 00:40:28,476
Are they crazy? lf l was a fella,
l'd be around all the time.

528
00:40:28,567 --> 00:40:31,161
Well, see if you can work it out.

529
00:40:31,367 --> 00:40:33,198
We have a date tomorrow.

530
00:40:34,687 --> 00:40:36,564
What's your name?

531
00:40:37,127 --> 00:40:38,162
Marie.

532
00:40:39,647 --> 00:40:41,126
What's yours?

533
00:40:41,207 --> 00:40:45,405
I'll tell you tomorrow. It'll give us
something interesting to talk about.

534
00:41:02,127 --> 00:41:03,196
Hi!.

535
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:05,318
What's up, hubby?

536
00:41:07,007 --> 00:41:08,520
I got these for you.

537
00:41:11,727 --> 00:41:12,842
Thanks.

538
00:41:13,247 --> 00:41:16,364
Navin, you know the other day
when l showed you the tattoo?

539
00:41:16,447 --> 00:41:17,675
Yeah.

540
00:41:18,647 --> 00:41:20,638
Well, l forgot to tell you something.

541
00:41:20,727 --> 00:41:23,036
-Really? What?
-This.

542
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:33,601
That's what's going to happen to you if
l ever catch you looking at another broad.

543
00:41:33,967 --> 00:41:35,400
I'm glad you told me.

544
00:41:35,487 --> 00:41:39,082
And remember, l did this without anger.

545
00:41:39,767 --> 00:41:42,486
And l stayed away from your crotch.

546
00:41:43,647 --> 00:41:45,285
Bye, sweetie.

547
00:41:47,487 --> 00:41:50,160
-Hi!.
-What happened?

548
00:41:50,447 --> 00:41:53,564
It was unbelievable.
These guys jumped me.

549
00:41:53,647 --> 00:41:56,525
They tried to get these flowers.
I got 'em for you.

550
00:41:56,607 --> 00:41:59,246
It's kind of a traditional date deal.

551
00:41:59,367 --> 00:42:02,484
Yeah, l've heard of that. What were they?

552
00:42:03,807 --> 00:42:05,638
Couple of dozen roses.

553
00:42:06,447 --> 00:42:08,165
Look like daisy stems.

554
00:42:08,287 --> 00:42:11,199
What? That guy gypped me.

555
00:42:11,287 --> 00:42:14,165
Put daisy stems on my roses.

556
00:42:14,967 --> 00:42:17,197
Look, these hoodlums are dangerous.

557
00:42:17,287 --> 00:42:19,926
I think we ought to get out of here
before she sees us.

558
00:42:20,367 --> 00:42:22,403
-"She"?
-What?

559
00:42:22,527 --> 00:42:25,200
-You said "she."
-No!.

560
00:42:25,287 --> 00:42:27,084
I always call a gang "she."

561
00:42:27,167 --> 00:42:30,557
It's like when you call a boat "she"
or a hurricane "she."

562
00:42:30,647 --> 00:42:31,796
Or a girl?

563
00:42:32,287 --> 00:42:36,439
You can call a girl "she." That's just one
of the many things you can call "she."

564
00:42:39,167 --> 00:42:40,964
Why are you smiling?

565
00:42:41,687 --> 00:42:44,121
You're the fiirst person
l've ever had at my place.

566
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,722
Do you live here?

567
00:42:46,287 --> 00:42:47,720
It's nice.

568
00:42:47,847 --> 00:42:49,075
Did you decorate it?

569
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:52,796
I got this from the old Cup O' Pizza place
before they tore it down.

570
00:42:56,567 --> 00:42:58,125
That was really good pizza.

571
00:42:58,247 --> 00:43:00,238
This is the best pizza in a cup ever.

572
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:03,956
This guy's unbelievable. He ran the old
Cup O' Pizza guy out of business.

573
00:43:04,047 --> 00:43:06,481
People come from all over to get this.

574
00:43:19,767 --> 00:43:22,804
You know, you have beautiful skin.

575
00:43:25,727 --> 00:43:26,921
May l?

576
00:43:33,047 --> 00:43:35,607
So smooth and flexible.

577
00:43:36,407 --> 00:43:39,001
I take after my mother's side of the family.

578
00:43:39,287 --> 00:43:42,996
It's amazing the way it
just snaps back like that. Amazing.

579
00:43:44,727 --> 00:43:46,763
-Are you a model?
-No.

580
00:43:49,047 --> 00:43:51,038
I'm a cosmetologist.

581
00:43:51,407 --> 00:43:54,046
Really? A cosmetologist?

582
00:43:54,887 --> 00:43:56,718
That's unbelievable.

583
00:43:57,207 --> 00:43:58,879
That's impressive.

584
00:43:59,207 --> 00:44:01,960
It must be tough
to handle the weightlessness.

585
00:44:03,727 --> 00:44:05,797
Can l ask you a personal question?

586
00:44:07,167 --> 00:44:08,600
What is it?

587
00:44:10,287 --> 00:44:12,005
Now be totally honest.

588
00:44:13,487 --> 00:44:15,603
You do have a boyfriend, don't you?

589
00:44:16,247 --> 00:44:17,441
Kind of.

590
00:44:19,127 --> 00:44:21,357
I know this is our first date, but...

591
00:44:23,567 --> 00:44:27,401
...do you think the next time
you make love to your boyfriend...

592
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:30,759
...you could think of me?

593
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:34,396
-I haven't made love to him yet.
-That's too bad.

594
00:44:35,487 --> 00:44:37,318
Do you think it's possible that...

595
00:44:37,767 --> 00:44:38,995
...someday...

596
00:44:40,167 --> 00:44:42,681
...you could make love with me
and think of him?

597
00:44:42,887 --> 00:44:44,115
Who knows?

598
00:44:44,327 --> 00:44:47,364
Maybe you and he can make love
and you could think of me.

599
00:44:49,087 --> 00:44:51,442
I'd just be happy to be in there somewhere.

600
00:45:07,567 --> 00:45:09,080
Do you have a girlfriend?

601
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:12,916
-Does it matter?
-I'd like to think you were available.

602
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:14,884
I'm available.

603
00:45:26,007 --> 00:45:27,326
Did you forget about my ass?

604
00:45:27,407 --> 00:45:29,602
No, l've been thinking about it.

605
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:31,918
She tattooed my name on her ass.

606
00:45:32,087 --> 00:45:34,078
Not just my name. A lot of names!.

607
00:45:34,247 --> 00:45:37,922
And funny things, too. She's got one
up here that says "Slippery when wet."

608
00:45:38,087 --> 00:45:41,124
-How do you know that?
-What is she, some great piece of ass?

609
00:45:41,207 --> 00:45:43,323
She's no great piece of ass!.

610
00:45:44,127 --> 00:45:47,005
I mean, wait a minute.

611
00:45:47,407 --> 00:45:50,319
We're all adults here.
Let's reason this out.

612
00:45:50,407 --> 00:45:52,762
Marie's the type of person that if you got--

613
00:45:52,847 --> 00:45:54,963
If this gash doesn't get out of here...

614
00:45:55,047 --> 00:45:57,402
...l am gonna drive this bike up her butt!.

615
00:45:57,487 --> 00:45:59,239
While Patti tends to be more direct.

616
00:45:59,327 --> 00:46:01,318
As for you, farm boy....

617
00:46:02,087 --> 00:46:03,600
We're married!.

618
00:46:03,687 --> 00:46:06,042
And as for you, kewpie doll--

619
00:46:08,807 --> 00:46:11,446
You protected me.
You must really like me.

620
00:46:17,327 --> 00:46:19,795
"l know, l know

621
00:46:19,967 --> 00:46:21,878
"You belong

622
00:46:22,367 --> 00:46:26,360
"To somebody new

623
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:29,801
"But tonight

624
00:46:30,087 --> 00:46:34,000
"You belong to me

625
00:46:37,807 --> 00:46:40,162
"Although, although

626
00:46:40,247 --> 00:46:42,681
"We're apart

627
00:46:42,807 --> 00:46:44,957
"You're part

"And tonight

"You belong

00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:37,675
"To me, just to little old me"

645
00:48:07,887 --> 00:48:09,445
You know...

646
00:48:10,327 --> 00:48:12,761
...while you were playing that just now...

647
00:48:13,847 --> 00:48:16,759
...l had the craziest fantasy that l could...

648
00:48:17,607 --> 00:48:18,926
...rise up...

649
00:48:19,407 --> 00:48:23,116
...float right down the end of this cornet...

650
00:48:23,647 --> 00:48:25,558
...right through here...

651
00:48:25,687 --> 00:48:27,757
...through these valves...

652
00:48:27,887 --> 00:48:30,242
...right along this tube...

653
00:48:30,647 --> 00:48:32,956
...come right up against your lips...

654
00:48:33,807 --> 00:48:35,718
...and give you a kiss.

655
00:48:38,327 --> 00:48:39,919
Why didn't you?

656
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:42,597
I didn't want to get spit on me.

657
00:49:33,087 --> 00:49:35,157
Was it good for you, too?

658
00:49:38,687 --> 00:49:40,917
I really do want to kiss you...

659
00:49:42,887 --> 00:49:44,525
...but l'm afraid.

660
00:49:45,127 --> 00:49:48,164
-I would have kept my tongue in.
-No, l mean...

661
00:49:50,687 --> 00:49:52,996
...l'm afraid if l kiss you...

662
00:49:54,847 --> 00:49:56,803
...l'll fall in love with you.

663
00:49:57,767 --> 00:49:59,166
You will?

664
00:49:59,767 --> 00:50:01,678
And l don't want to.

665
00:50:02,967 --> 00:50:04,446
You don't?

666
00:50:05,767 --> 00:50:09,919
My mother sacrificed everything
to send me through cosmetology school.

667
00:50:10,167 --> 00:50:11,566
She did?

668
00:50:12,807 --> 00:50:15,640
She has this dream
for me to be something.

669
00:50:16,247 --> 00:50:17,646
She does?

670
00:50:18,727 --> 00:50:21,878
To marry someone with power...

671
00:50:22,687 --> 00:50:24,803
...money, vision.

672
00:50:26,127 --> 00:50:28,595
Someone with a special purpose.

673
00:50:31,767 --> 00:50:33,439
I've got one!.

674
00:50:34,007 --> 00:50:37,238
-I've got a special purpose!.
-You do?

675
00:50:37,327 --> 00:50:39,283
Yes!. It's fantastic!.

676
00:50:39,367 --> 00:50:42,439
It's great!. It's unbelievable!.

677
00:50:42,607 --> 00:50:46,520
And l was afraid to tell you about it.
Your mother's gonna love me!.

678
00:50:49,207 --> 00:50:51,437
Marie, are you awake?

679
00:50:53,407 --> 00:50:54,522
Good.

680
00:50:56,367 --> 00:50:58,483
You look so beautiful and peaceful...

681
00:50:58,727 --> 00:51:00,365
...you almost look dead.

682
00:51:03,247 --> 00:51:04,726
I'm glad because...

683
00:51:05,007 --> 00:51:08,841
...there's something l want to say that's
always been difficult for me to say.

684
00:51:10,767 --> 00:51:14,203
I slit the sheet, the sheet l slit
and on the slitted sheet l sit.

685
00:51:16,767 --> 00:51:20,362
I've never been relaxed enough
around anyone to be able to say that.

686
00:51:21,327 --> 00:51:23,557
You give me confidence in myself.

687
00:51:24,967 --> 00:51:28,801
I know we've only known each other
for four weeks and three days...

688
00:51:29,167 --> 00:51:33,080
...but to me, it seems like
nine weeks and five days.

689
00:51:34,847 --> 00:51:37,441
The first day seemed like a week.

690
00:51:38,087 --> 00:51:41,477
And the second day seemed like five days.

691
00:51:41,847 --> 00:51:44,361
And the third day
seemed like a week again.

692
00:51:44,687 --> 00:51:47,918
And the fourth day seemed like eight days.

693
00:51:48,407 --> 00:51:51,558
But the fifth day
you went to see your mother...

694
00:51:51,847 --> 00:51:54,202
...and that seemed just like a day.

695
00:51:54,567 --> 00:51:57,604
But then you came back, and later...

696
00:51:58,127 --> 00:52:01,119
...on the sixth day, in the evening,
when we saw each other...

697
00:52:01,247 --> 00:52:04,922
...that started seeming like two days.

698
00:52:05,407 --> 00:52:08,877
So in the evening, it seemed
like two days spilling into the next day...

699
00:52:08,967 --> 00:52:13,438
...and that started seeming like four days.
So, at the end of the sixth day...

700
00:52:13,527 --> 00:52:17,202
...on into the seventh day,
it seemed like a total of five days.

701
00:52:17,927 --> 00:52:23,047
And the sixth day seemed like
a week and a half.

702
00:52:24,607 --> 00:52:29,044
I have it written down, but l can show it
to you tomorrow if you want to see it.

703
00:52:29,727 --> 00:52:33,561
Anyway, l've decided that tomorrow...

704
00:52:34,287 --> 00:52:39,156
...when the time is right,
l'm going to ask you to marry me.

705
00:52:41,287 --> 00:52:45,075
If that's okay with you,
just don't say anything.

706
00:52:49,647 --> 00:52:51,638
You've made me very happy.

707
00:52:58,887 --> 00:53:03,836
"Oh, l'll see you again

708
00:53:04,047 --> 00:53:08,598
"Whenever spring breaks through again"

709
00:53:09,047 --> 00:53:10,480
Honey, sing!.

710
00:53:12,767 --> 00:53:15,839
"Time may lie heavy between

711
00:53:16,167 --> 00:53:18,123
"But what has been

712
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:21,677
"ls past forgetting

713
00:53:22,167 --> 00:53:26,206
"This sweet memory

714
00:53:26,287 --> 00:53:31,805
"Across the years will come to me

715
00:53:32,527 --> 00:53:36,600
"Though my world may go awry

716
00:53:37,327 --> 00:53:41,878
"ln my heart will ever lie

717
00:53:42,727 --> 00:53:47,198
"Just the echo of a sigh

718
00:53:50,847 --> 00:53:52,360
"Good-bye"

719
00:53:53,207 --> 00:53:56,836
Honey, who's the happiest guy
in the world?

720
00:53:58,007 --> 00:53:59,042
You are!.

721
00:53:59,647 --> 00:54:03,606
That's right!. And who's the happiest gal?

722
00:54:05,847 --> 00:54:07,565
That's right.

723
00:54:07,647 --> 00:54:11,117
Honey, guess what?
l wrote a song for you this morning:

724
00:54:11,247 --> 00:54:15,638
"Oh, l'm picking out a thermos for you

725
00:54:15,727 --> 00:54:19,322
"Not an ordinary thermos for you

726
00:54:19,527 --> 00:54:23,156
"But the extra best thermos you can buy

727
00:54:23,287 --> 00:54:26,677
"With vinyl and stripes
and a cup built right in

728
00:54:26,767 --> 00:54:30,555
"l'm picking out a thermos for you

729
00:54:30,647 --> 00:54:33,798
"And maybe a barometer too

730
00:54:33,887 --> 00:54:37,675
"And what else can l buy
so on me you'll rely

731
00:54:37,767 --> 00:54:40,327
"A rear-end thermometer too"

732
00:54:40,407 --> 00:54:44,320
Honey!. There's a question
l've been wanting to pop but...

733
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:46,563
...l've been afraid you'd say no.

734
00:54:46,887 --> 00:54:51,165
But this seems like
the right time and place, so here goes.

735
00:54:52,167 --> 00:54:54,920
Honey, will you marry me?

736
00:54:58,407 --> 00:55:02,878
Come on, let's seal it with a kiss!.
Get in the tub with me!.

737
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:06,686
Not you, Shithead. Where's Marie?

738
00:55:07,847 --> 00:55:09,166
What letter?

739
00:55:16,727 --> 00:55:18,319
"Dear...."

740
00:55:34,567 --> 00:55:36,159
Marie!.

741
00:55:36,807 --> 00:55:40,083
Shithead!. Come here!. Good idea!.

742
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:43,241
Why did you leave me?

743
00:55:43,327 --> 00:55:45,966
I couldn't read the letter!.
It was too blurry!.

744
00:55:48,527 --> 00:55:49,755
Here, boy.

745
00:55:56,087 --> 00:55:57,998
Where are you?

746
00:56:13,967 --> 00:56:16,003
This is not going to be easy, Shithead.

747
00:56:17,247 --> 00:56:19,317
We've been together a long time.

748
00:56:19,927 --> 00:56:22,316
But l've got to head down that road.

749
00:56:23,607 --> 00:56:27,600
There'll be times out there
when there won't be enough food for two.

750
00:56:27,887 --> 00:56:29,286
And l won't be able to--

751
00:56:29,927 --> 00:56:31,326
Wait a minute.

752
00:56:31,407 --> 00:56:32,760
I'm not done yet.

753
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:34,758
Come back, l'm not finished.

754
00:56:34,847 --> 00:56:36,678
I have some more to tell ya.

755
00:56:39,247 --> 00:56:41,841
You'll find a family
who can give you a real home...

756
00:56:41,927 --> 00:56:44,964
...with loving kids and a warm fireplace.

757
00:56:45,367 --> 00:56:47,278
I never liked you, anyway.

758
00:56:47,447 --> 00:56:49,483
Now get out of here!.

759
00:56:50,207 --> 00:56:53,244
Okay, okay!. You win!.
You can go with me.

760
00:56:57,167 --> 00:57:00,477
"And so, Mom, with my faithful dog
leading the way...

761
00:57:00,887 --> 00:57:03,526
"...l'm out to win the hand ofMarie.

762
00:57:03,647 --> 00:57:08,641
"You'd love her, Mom. She looksjust
like you, except she's white and blonde.

763
00:57:09,127 --> 00:57:12,483
"So, to win her back,
l've vowed to make something of myself.

764
00:57:12,567 --> 00:57:16,958
"l settled in Los Angeles, took the money
l saved and rented my fiirst apartment.

765
00:57:17,607 --> 00:57:19,404
"l haven't heard from Marie.

766
00:57:20,367 --> 00:57:24,121
"Things couldn't be worse.
I can only send you 49 cents this week..."

767
00:57:24,207 --> 00:57:26,880
-Bless his heart.
-That's a good boy.

768
00:57:26,967 --> 00:57:29,527
"...as l've lost all my jobs.

769
00:57:29,967 --> 00:57:33,880
"l've been eating well. The hospital
gives out free orange juice and cookies...

770
00:57:33,967 --> 00:57:36,765
"...and all l have to do
is give them a pint of blood.

771
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:40,563
"l ate there all week, three times a day."

772
00:57:40,687 --> 00:57:41,563
Pint of blood?

773
00:57:41,647 --> 00:57:46,198
"l quit when l cut myself shaving
and nothing came out but air.

774
00:57:47,647 --> 00:57:51,925
"l have to go now as someone
is staring at me through binoculars.

775
00:57:52,007 --> 00:57:53,838
"Your loving son, Navin."

776
00:57:57,207 --> 00:57:58,879
It's him.

777
00:58:05,567 --> 00:58:06,716
Him.

778
00:58:11,367 --> 00:58:14,882
What's him doing here?
Shithead!. Shithead!.

779
00:58:16,127 --> 00:58:18,083
Attack!. Attack!.

780
00:58:19,327 --> 00:58:21,079
Not me!.

781
00:58:22,567 --> 00:58:24,398
Get off, Shithead!.

782
00:59:20,567 --> 00:59:22,797
You're going to have to sign for this.

783
00:59:25,207 --> 00:59:27,402
I have to sign before you shoot me?

784
00:59:27,567 --> 00:59:29,558
I'm not gonna shoot ya!.

785
00:59:30,727 --> 00:59:33,241
-Why not?
-That was the old me.

786
00:59:33,327 --> 00:59:35,602
I was a little mixed up at that time.

787
00:59:35,727 --> 00:59:39,197
Had a bad marriage,
and l just gave up smoking.

788
00:59:39,447 --> 00:59:41,119
I'm okay now.

789
00:59:42,167 --> 00:59:44,044
I'm a private detective.

790
00:59:51,007 --> 00:59:53,316
-So long.
-Thank you.

791
01:00:01,127 --> 01:00:03,243
"Dear Mr. Johnson...

792
01:00:04,127 --> 01:00:06,436
"...please call on me, in Suite...

793
01:00:07,647 --> 01:00:11,242
"...2655 at the Century Plaza Tower...

794
01:00:11,727 --> 01:00:13,126
"...in Los Angeles.

795
01:00:14,127 --> 01:00:18,917
"l have something ofgreat importance
to impart to you."

796
01:00:19,687 --> 01:00:22,121
Navin!. Remember me?

797
01:00:23,127 --> 01:00:25,641
-No, but don't feel bad.
-Fox.

798
01:00:27,047 --> 01:00:28,685
Stan Fox!.

799
01:00:28,767 --> 01:00:30,883
Remember the gas station?

800
01:00:31,087 --> 01:00:35,285
Boy, you are one hard guy to find!.

801
01:00:38,047 --> 01:00:39,605
You don't remember me.

802
01:00:41,327 --> 01:00:43,557
The glasses handle!. Look!.

803
01:00:45,647 --> 01:00:46,921
Yeah.

804
01:00:47,407 --> 01:00:50,001
-My glasses handle.
-Use the Opti-Grab.

805
01:00:50,487 --> 01:00:53,285
-"Opti-Grab"?
-Yeah, we call it Opti-Grab.

806
01:00:53,367 --> 01:00:55,961
-Opti-Grab.
-"Opti," from the eye...

807
01:00:56,087 --> 01:00:58,681
...and "grab," from where you grab it!.

808
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:00,804
Opti-grabbing it!.

809
01:01:00,887 --> 01:01:02,764
Navin, my boy, we're in business!.

810
01:01:03,007 --> 01:01:05,680
Fifty-fifty, just like we said.

811
01:01:05,847 --> 01:01:08,759
Right in here l have your first check...

812
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:12,040
...for two hundred and fifty big ones.

813
01:01:12,607 --> 01:01:14,120
Two-fifty?

814
01:01:14,567 --> 01:01:17,525
That's just the beginning.
There's gonna be more. Lots more!.

815
01:01:17,887 --> 01:01:19,400
Can l cash this?

816
01:01:19,527 --> 01:01:23,486
You can do whatever you like.
It's your money. It's a cashier's check.

817
01:01:23,887 --> 01:01:25,286
I can use money!.

818
01:01:25,687 --> 01:01:30,556
Yes, l have a cashier's check,
and l'd like to cash it.

819
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:32,405
How much is it for?

820
01:01:32,567 --> 01:01:36,765
Two hundred and fifty big ones.

821
01:01:40,767 --> 01:01:43,839
Two hundred and fifty dollareenies.

822
01:01:46,207 --> 01:01:49,836
That's two hundred and fifty doughnuts.

823
01:01:52,527 --> 01:01:54,085
You want to cash this?

824
01:01:54,287 --> 01:01:56,596
Well, l could take fifty of the doughnuts...

825
01:01:56,687 --> 01:01:59,599
...and deposit the other
two-hundred beauties.

826
01:01:59,727 --> 01:02:03,402
-Have a seat, Mr. Johnson.
-Thank you.

827
01:02:04,607 --> 01:02:06,757
I will need two pieces of identification.

828
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:11,602
Yes. I have my
temporary driver's license...

829
01:02:12,807 --> 01:02:16,766
...and my astronaut application form.

830
01:02:17,927 --> 01:02:21,636
I didn't pass that, though.
I failed everything but the date of birth.

831
01:02:21,767 --> 01:02:23,325
Didn't get the job.

832
01:02:23,527 --> 01:02:27,918
Everything's in order.
If you'll just endorse this there.

833
01:02:28,527 --> 01:02:30,119
-I need a pen.
-Pen. Okay.

834
01:02:30,207 --> 01:02:32,198
-Right here.
-Thank you.

835
01:02:33,527 --> 01:02:36,644
Fill out this deposit slip right there.

836
01:02:37,207 --> 01:02:40,995
The endorsing and filling out
of the deposit slip.

837
01:02:41,287 --> 01:02:45,200
Two-hundred and fifty...

838
01:02:45,567 --> 01:02:47,478
...thousand--

839
01:02:58,927 --> 01:03:01,646
"Dear Harry, guess what?

840
01:03:01,767 --> 01:03:03,803
"l'm rich beyond my wildest dreams.

841
01:03:04,047 --> 01:03:07,676
"But l haven't forgotten our deal.
Here's that postcard l promised you.

842
01:03:07,767 --> 01:03:10,281
"l bet you thought you'd never get it.

843
01:03:10,447 --> 01:03:12,563
"Your friend forever, Navin."

844
01:03:12,807 --> 01:03:14,320
How do you like that?

845
01:03:14,647 --> 01:03:17,445
He promised me a postcard,
and he sent me a postcard.

846
01:03:18,167 --> 01:03:19,646
Kid has integrity.

847
01:03:37,087 --> 01:03:39,123
Shithead, come on.

848
01:03:53,127 --> 01:03:55,721
Hello? Yes?

849
01:03:56,367 --> 01:03:59,086
Who? Mrs. Kimball?

850
01:04:00,807 --> 01:04:02,445
You're Marie's mom!.

851
01:04:03,247 --> 01:04:05,283
You read about me in the paper?

852
01:04:05,367 --> 01:04:07,961
I've been trying to reach her,
l don't know where she is.

853
01:04:08,047 --> 01:04:10,083
I'd give anything to find out.

854
01:04:11,087 --> 01:04:12,884
Well, that sounds a little high.

855
01:04:13,287 --> 01:04:15,039
How about $75?

856
01:04:16,007 --> 01:04:18,567
Okay, what is it?

857
01:04:19,047 --> 01:04:21,481
The May Company in Los Angeles.

858
01:04:21,567 --> 01:04:24,718
Shithead!. I know where she is!.
I know where she is!.

859
01:04:24,927 --> 01:04:26,997
Now, doesn't that feel good?

860
01:04:30,007 --> 01:04:32,362
There now, we are complete.

861
01:04:34,487 --> 01:04:36,876
Putting on Mask-O-Derm
just took a few minutes...

862
01:04:36,967 --> 01:04:39,527
...and when we peel it off
he'll look 20 years younger.

863
01:04:39,607 --> 01:04:41,040
Alevai.

864
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:42,765
Yes, exactly.

865
01:04:42,847 --> 01:04:48,046
Now, we'll let this dry. In the meantime,
we can pick out an eye shadow and lip tint.

866
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:50,083
Everyone follow me this way...

867
01:04:50,167 --> 01:04:53,682
...because this is a very interesting line.
I think you'll enjoy this.

868
01:04:53,767 --> 01:04:58,283
With your husband's coloring,
a deep tone would bring out his lips.

869
01:04:58,367 --> 01:05:02,519
This Nature Beige
will feature his eyes just wonderfully.

870
01:05:02,607 --> 01:05:04,438
Let's try everything.

871
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:08,555
What?

872
01:05:10,367 --> 01:05:14,280
Let's go unmask lrving.
Everyone, back this way.

873
01:05:14,527 --> 01:05:17,678
We are now going to peel off
our Mask-O-Derm.

874
01:05:17,767 --> 01:05:22,045
Irving's skin will be tighter, firmer
and he'll look like a different man.

875
01:05:22,127 --> 01:05:23,924
You'll be amazed.

876
01:05:24,367 --> 01:05:26,323
Get ready, lrving!.

877
01:05:40,247 --> 01:05:43,159
This shit really worked.

878
01:05:49,727 --> 01:05:51,683
My sweetheart.

879
01:05:52,167 --> 01:05:55,000
What are you doing to my husband,
you Miss Blondie?

880
01:05:55,087 --> 01:05:57,317
Irving, are you crazy?

881
01:05:57,407 --> 01:06:00,558
"Dear Mom, the big news is:
Marie and l were married.

882
01:06:00,647 --> 01:06:02,080
"We couldn't wait.

883
01:06:02,167 --> 01:06:07,366
"We found someone at the Hollywood View
Apartments who could do it immediately.

884
01:06:07,447 --> 01:06:09,563
"He was a certifiiedpriest.

885
01:06:12,167 --> 01:06:14,522
"We were both glad
we had a religious wedding.

886
01:06:15,047 --> 01:06:17,402
"Money hasn't changed our lives
that much.

887
01:06:17,687 --> 01:06:21,236
"Our one little extravagance
is a live-in butler and housekeeper."

888
01:06:21,367 --> 01:06:25,280
-Another check!.
-Just as l thought.

889
01:06:25,367 --> 01:06:28,564
Look at that. Nearly $750,000.

890
01:06:28,687 --> 01:06:33,078
With this kind of income, you could buy
a larger house with servants' quarters.

891
01:06:33,407 --> 01:06:37,320
"Well, Mom, remember my dream
of owning a big house on a hill...

892
01:06:37,447 --> 01:06:42,202
"...and how l used to wish for a living room
with a plaster lion in it from Mexico?

893
01:06:42,287 --> 01:06:45,836
"And how l always wanted
a large 24-seat dining table...

894
01:06:45,927 --> 01:06:51,160
"...in a dining room with original paintings
by Michelangelo and Rembrandt?

895
01:06:51,487 --> 01:06:53,921
"And remember how l always wanted
a rotating bed...

896
01:06:54,007 --> 01:06:56,919
"...with pink chiffon and zebra stripes?

897
01:06:57,007 --> 01:06:59,680
"And remember how l used to chitchat
with dad about...

898
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:02,879
"...always wanting a bathtub
shaped like a clam...

899
01:07:03,007 --> 01:07:05,760
"...and an offiice
with orange and white stripes?

900
01:07:05,847 --> 01:07:10,523
"Remember how much l wanted an all red
billiard room with a giant stuffed camel...

901
01:07:10,687 --> 01:07:14,362
"...and how l wanted a disco room
with my own disco dancers...

902
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:17,245
"...and a party room with fancy friends?

903
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:21,436
"And remember how much l wanted
a big backyard with Grecian statues...

904
01:07:21,527 --> 01:07:24,121
"...S-shaped hedges,
and three swimming pools?

905
01:07:24,207 --> 01:07:26,198
"Well, l got that too.

906
01:07:28,607 --> 01:07:30,996
"Marie and l are getting along swell...

907
01:07:31,327 --> 01:07:34,876
"...but l've got a lot to learn
about handling my money and banks.

908
01:07:35,207 --> 01:07:36,925
"You have to be careful.

909
01:07:38,567 --> 01:07:40,205
"Poor Hobart.

910
01:07:40,367 --> 01:07:43,325
"His dear wife Hester took money
out of her savings account...

911
01:07:43,407 --> 01:07:46,604
"...and had to pay a substantial penalty
for early withdrawal.

912
01:07:51,127 --> 01:07:54,278
"Enclosed is this week's check.
Love, Navin."

913
01:07:55,047 --> 01:07:57,083
Sorry about your wife, Hobart.

914
01:07:57,167 --> 01:07:59,362
Federal regulations, sir.

915
01:08:00,007 --> 01:08:01,281
Dear me.

916
01:08:01,527 --> 01:08:05,600
Your wife has given you
another gold chain.

917
01:08:06,447 --> 01:08:08,165
I'd nearly forgotten.

918
01:08:08,527 --> 01:08:11,917
I suppose l'm still not quite
over Hester's death.

919
01:08:12,007 --> 01:08:13,838
Well, these things take time.

920
01:08:13,927 --> 01:08:15,963
Yes, so l'm told.

921
01:08:16,047 --> 01:08:19,835
Here's your drink, sir.
Like the one you saw in the magazine.

922
01:08:19,927 --> 01:08:22,316
You got the bamboo umbrella
and everything.

923
01:08:25,607 --> 01:08:28,679
See that? "Be somebody."

924
01:08:31,327 --> 01:08:33,761
Very good, sir. Very good.

925
01:08:36,407 --> 01:08:39,080
There are some charity people here
to see you, sir.

926
01:08:39,167 --> 01:08:41,806
No!. Send them away!.

927
01:08:41,887 --> 01:08:44,276
There's a lot of people
more deserving than me!.

928
01:08:44,367 --> 01:08:47,200
But these people want you to give.

929
01:08:51,767 --> 01:08:52,802
Okay.

930
01:08:52,927 --> 01:08:56,317
My name is
Father Carlos Las Vegas De Cordoba.

931
01:08:56,967 --> 01:08:59,401
Father, you seem like a religious man.

932
01:08:59,887 --> 01:09:01,240
How can l help you?

933
01:09:01,327 --> 01:09:05,002
By giving me three minutes of your time
so that you can see some film...

934
01:09:05,087 --> 01:09:08,477
...of a great ugliness
that is spreading in my country.

935
01:09:09,367 --> 01:09:12,086
God. I'll bet it's disgusting.

936
01:09:12,967 --> 01:09:14,798
-Hobart?
-Yes, sir?

937
01:09:14,887 --> 01:09:17,242
Are you over your grief enough
to dim the lights?

938
01:09:17,327 --> 01:09:20,876
Of course, sir. One can't mourn forever.

939
01:09:21,087 --> 01:09:23,999
You will not believe
what you are about to see...

940
01:09:24,567 --> 01:09:27,161
...that human beings
could have sunk so low...

941
01:09:27,247 --> 01:09:31,035
...that they can take pleasure to do this
to another of God's creatures.

942
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:33,601
I hope you have a strong stomach, senor.

943
01:09:33,767 --> 01:09:35,166
Roll the ugliness.

944
01:10:12,727 --> 01:10:16,800
Good Lord. I've heard about this.
Cat juggling.

945
01:10:35,647 --> 01:10:38,605
Stop it, stop it, stop it!.

946
01:10:39,527 --> 01:10:40,642
Good.

947
01:10:41,567 --> 01:10:45,765
Father, could there be a God
that would let this happen?

948
01:10:46,847 --> 01:10:48,644
How much do you want?

949
01:10:48,807 --> 01:10:52,402
If your initial investment is $500,000...

950
01:10:52,567 --> 01:10:55,161
...and your apartments are up in March...

951
01:10:55,287 --> 01:10:59,439
...you should have "x" amount of dollars
rolling in by the end of this year.

952
01:10:59,967 --> 01:11:02,527
"x" amount. That's very good, isn't it?

953
01:11:02,607 --> 01:11:05,838
You can depreciate the entire building
for the full amount.

954
01:11:05,967 --> 01:11:08,686
Depreciate!. Very good. I like that.

955
01:11:08,767 --> 01:11:11,645
And we've found a way to get around
this fair housing crap.

956
01:11:11,887 --> 01:11:14,526
Good!. Getting around the crap.
That's good.

957
01:11:15,327 --> 01:11:18,717
By keeping the rents high,
we'll appeal to a select class of people.

958
01:11:18,807 --> 01:11:20,684
Select class. Very good.

959
01:11:21,967 --> 01:11:23,764
We'll keep the eggplants out.

960
01:11:23,847 --> 01:11:26,236
Good. We don't want any vegetables.

961
01:11:26,327 --> 01:11:28,397
No. The jungle bunnies!.

962
01:11:28,607 --> 01:11:30,962
Of course. They'll eat the vegetables.

963
01:11:31,527 --> 01:11:33,722
Boss, could l talk to him?

964
01:11:34,287 --> 01:11:36,357
We're gonna keep out the niggers.

965
01:11:37,007 --> 01:11:37,996
The what?

966
01:11:38,087 --> 01:11:40,157
The niggers. We'll keep 'em out.

967
01:11:40,727 --> 01:11:41,955
-Yes.
-Sir...

968
01:11:42,687 --> 01:11:45,076
...you are talking to a nigger!.

969
01:12:30,447 --> 01:12:32,517
Don't be so hard on yourself.

970
01:12:32,607 --> 01:12:35,519
How could you know
that was "lron Balls" McGinty?

971
01:12:36,287 --> 01:12:38,084
Escargot. Salad.

972
01:12:39,447 --> 01:12:42,359
Would Monsieur care for another bottle
of the Chteau Latour.

973
01:12:42,447 --> 01:12:44,677
Yes, but no more 1966.

974
01:12:44,767 --> 01:12:47,645
Let's splurge. Bring us some fresh wine.

975
01:12:47,727 --> 01:12:49,126
The freshest you've got.

976
01:12:49,207 --> 01:12:51,641
This year's. No more of this old stuff.

977
01:12:52,807 --> 01:12:54,206
Oui, Monsieur.

978
01:12:54,687 --> 01:12:58,123
He doesn't realize he's dealing
with sophisticated people here.

979
01:12:58,647 --> 01:13:00,285
Marie, just stay calm.

980
01:13:00,687 --> 01:13:01,836
Don't look down.

981
01:13:01,927 --> 01:13:05,636
Don't look down. Look up.
Keep your eyes up and keep 'em that way.

982
01:13:05,807 --> 01:13:06,762
Waiter.

983
01:13:09,207 --> 01:13:11,675
There are snails on her plate.

984
01:13:14,127 --> 01:13:16,721
Now get them out of here
before she sees them!.

985
01:13:16,967 --> 01:13:19,037
Look away!. Keep your eyes that way!.

986
01:13:19,767 --> 01:13:23,806
You'd think at a fancy restaurant like this
you'd be able to keep the snails...

987
01:13:23,887 --> 01:13:25,605
...off the food!.

988
01:13:25,687 --> 01:13:28,520
There are so many snails in there
you can't see the food.

989
01:13:28,607 --> 01:13:32,236
Remove them!. Bring me the cheese
sandwich appetizers you talked me out of.

990
01:13:32,327 --> 01:13:33,760
Oui, Monsieur.

991
01:13:34,967 --> 01:13:36,320
Can you believe this?

992
01:13:36,407 --> 01:13:40,116
First they didn't have umbrellas
for the wine, now snails on the food.

993
01:13:40,207 --> 01:13:42,960
Two boobs. That's what he takes us for.

994
01:13:54,207 --> 01:13:56,323
-Hi, honey.
-Hi, doll face.

995
01:13:56,407 --> 01:13:57,635
Everything okay?

996
01:13:57,767 --> 01:14:01,646
Remember how you told me
to take unnecessary lessons?

997
01:14:01,807 --> 01:14:03,843
Well, l just took a lesson.

998
01:14:04,007 --> 01:14:06,475
And a very good student too.
Adios, senora.

999
01:14:07,207 --> 01:14:08,925
You took bullfighting?

1000
01:14:09,007 --> 01:14:11,077
No. Knife-throwing.

1001
01:14:12,367 --> 01:14:13,846
Knife-throwing's great!.

1002
01:14:13,927 --> 01:14:17,203
-I can almost do it.
-Well, let me see your stuff!.

1003
01:14:17,367 --> 01:14:18,561
Okay.

1004
01:14:19,767 --> 01:14:21,962
This is very good for a beginner.

1005
01:14:24,167 --> 01:14:26,522
This is exciting. I love this!.

1006
01:14:27,207 --> 01:14:28,560
Come on!.

1007
01:14:29,807 --> 01:14:31,877
-Turn sideways...
-Okay.

1008
01:14:32,127 --> 01:14:34,243
...and put a balloon in your mouth.

1009
01:14:34,847 --> 01:14:36,405
Do you have a balloon?

1010
01:14:37,127 --> 01:14:39,800
No. Wait. Yes!.

1011
01:14:41,247 --> 01:14:42,123
Okay.

1012
01:14:43,247 --> 01:14:44,726
Is it in your mouth?

1013
01:14:44,847 --> 01:14:47,600
Throw 'em good and hard, so they'll stick.

1014
01:14:48,847 --> 01:14:50,041
Okay.

1015
01:14:53,207 --> 01:14:54,322
One...

1016
01:14:55,127 --> 01:14:56,401
...two...

1017
01:14:57,567 --> 01:14:58,682
...three!.

1018
01:14:59,567 --> 01:15:00,841
Four, five, six!.

1019
01:15:05,487 --> 01:15:06,840
I missed.

1020
01:15:07,127 --> 01:15:08,719
Honey, you did good.

1021
01:15:09,287 --> 01:15:11,517
I can't do anything right.

1022
01:15:12,367 --> 01:15:15,006
Honey, you worry too much.

1023
01:15:16,167 --> 01:15:19,762
Come on. Let's flop this over
and look at it another way.

1024
01:15:19,847 --> 01:15:22,680
Do you realize that
in the past two short months...

1025
01:15:22,767 --> 01:15:28,000
...we have acquired the sophistication
it takes some people a lifetime to acquire?

1026
01:15:28,287 --> 01:15:29,720
Come on!.

1027
01:15:30,167 --> 01:15:31,680
Let's toast!.

1028
01:16:26,887 --> 01:16:30,402
Everybody, Navin's on TV.
Marie, it's Navin!.

1029
01:16:30,647 --> 01:16:33,400
Look, honey,
here's that interview you did on TV.

1030
01:16:33,687 --> 01:16:35,245
Shut off the music!.

1031
01:16:36,407 --> 01:16:39,046
Everyone, we're going to watch Navin
on the TV.

1032
01:16:39,127 --> 01:16:42,324
Sit down, sit down.
On the floor. Sit around.

1033
01:16:42,807 --> 01:16:45,526
American Time news magazine
turns its probing eye...

1034
01:16:45,607 --> 01:16:48,565
...on Navin Johnson,
the inventor ofthe Opti-Grab...

1035
01:16:48,807 --> 01:16:53,119
...that little glasses handle that sold
10 million units in a few short months.

1036
01:16:53,927 --> 01:16:58,000
Mr. Johnson, you've become
a millionaire overnight. Who are you?

1037
01:16:59,687 --> 01:17:01,678
Who is Navin Johnson?

1038
01:17:02,727 --> 01:17:05,924
Navin is a complex personality,
as are most ofthe...

1039
01:17:06,007 --> 01:17:09,522
...small breed of modern-day
renaissance millionaires.

1040
01:17:10,127 --> 01:17:13,278
We hadplanned to show you
the entire Johnson interview.

1041
01:17:13,447 --> 01:17:17,076
However, when we returned to our studio,
our news department informed us...

1042
01:17:17,167 --> 01:17:20,398
...ofa sensational development
in the Johnson story.

1043
01:17:20,647 --> 01:17:23,002
It seems that an irate group of citizens...

1044
01:17:23,087 --> 01:17:25,760
...led by the celebrity, Mr. Carl Reiner...

1045
01:17:25,847 --> 01:17:29,840
...has fiiled a class action suit
against Mr. Johnson and his Opti-Grab.

1046
01:17:30,247 --> 01:17:33,239
Here's what Mr. Reiner had to say
at a press conference:

1047
01:17:33,327 --> 01:17:36,524
When Opti-Grab came out
l thought it was the greatest thing ever.

1048
01:17:36,607 --> 01:17:40,077
And l bought a pair. And this is the result.

1049
01:17:41,527 --> 01:17:45,236
This little handle is like a magnet.
Your eyes are drawn to it...

1050
01:17:45,447 --> 01:17:47,403
...and you end up cockeyed.

1051
01:17:47,847 --> 01:17:50,998
Now, as a director,
l am constantly using my eyes...

1052
01:17:51,127 --> 01:17:55,166
...and this Opti-Grab device
has caused irreparable harm to my career.

1053
01:17:55,287 --> 01:17:57,562
Let me show you a clip
from my latest fiilm...

1054
01:17:57,647 --> 01:18:02,084
...where my faulty depth perception kept
me from yelling "cut" at the right time.

1055
01:18:05,327 --> 01:18:06,237
Cut!

1056
01:18:14,727 --> 01:18:19,164
Ifl had yelled "cut" on time,
those actors would be alive today.

1057
01:18:19,887 --> 01:18:24,119
That's why l am spearheading the
$10 million class action suit...

1058
01:18:24,207 --> 01:18:27,882
...against Mr. Johnson,
and his irresponsible selling ofa product...

1059
01:18:27,967 --> 01:18:30,481
...he didn't even test on prisoners!

1060
01:18:31,407 --> 01:18:33,841
-Thank you.
-Party's over!.

1061
01:18:36,807 --> 01:18:38,798
Wait a second. Where you going?

1062
01:18:39,927 --> 01:18:42,521
I'm gonna get in touch
with that Reiner guy.

1063
01:18:43,727 --> 01:18:45,843
I got some change upstairs.

1064
01:18:45,927 --> 01:18:48,805
We'll get some potato chips
and there's some beer up there.

1065
01:18:48,887 --> 01:18:50,957
We'll make it a less formal thing.

1066
01:18:52,527 --> 01:18:54,518
Let's find another party.

1067
01:18:57,407 --> 01:19:00,365
Honey!. Why the gloom?

1068
01:19:00,527 --> 01:19:02,643
This is not the end of the rainbow.

1069
01:19:04,087 --> 01:19:06,157
I'm Navin Johnson, inventor!.

1070
01:19:06,287 --> 01:19:09,199
This is no big deal.
This is a parking ticket to me.

1071
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:12,286
Only instead of $5, it's $10 million.

1072
01:19:13,607 --> 01:19:16,565
I don't care about losing all the money.

1073
01:19:16,887 --> 01:19:19,447
It's losing all the stuff.

1074
01:19:20,607 --> 01:19:22,723
We're not gonna lose the stuff.

1075
01:19:24,047 --> 01:19:25,765
This is America!.

1076
01:19:25,847 --> 01:19:29,601
We're going to receive a fair trial
from an impartial jury!.

1077
01:19:31,047 --> 01:19:34,323
Your honor, we, the jury,
find for the plaintiff.

1078
01:19:39,487 --> 01:19:42,047
I award to Mr. Reiner...

1079
01:19:42,607 --> 01:19:44,484
...and the other 9 million...

1080
01:19:44,687 --> 01:19:47,281
...987 thousand...

1081
01:19:47,367 --> 01:19:49,756
...652 plaintiffs...

1082
01:19:50,367 --> 01:19:52,358
...the full amount of the suit.

1083
01:19:54,247 --> 01:19:55,999
Court is adjourned.

1084
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:04,880
-Navin.
-Honey, can't you see l'm drinking?

1085
01:20:11,767 --> 01:20:13,997
Pay to the order of...

1086
01:20:14,927 --> 01:20:17,122
...Mrs. Wilbur Stark...

1087
01:20:18,447 --> 01:20:20,836
...one dollar and nine cents.

1088
01:20:36,727 --> 01:20:38,524
Pay to the order of...

1089
01:20:39,607 --> 01:20:42,360
..."lron Balls" McGinty...

1090
01:20:43,767 --> 01:20:46,156
...one dollar and nine cents.

1091
01:20:48,047 --> 01:20:51,244
Why are you crying?
And why are you wearing that old dress?

1092
01:20:51,367 --> 01:20:55,519
Because l just heard a song on the radio
that reminded me of the way we were.

1093
01:20:55,807 --> 01:20:58,446
-What was it?
-The Way We Were.

1094
01:20:59,007 --> 01:21:01,521
Look at us. We've hit bottom.

1095
01:21:01,607 --> 01:21:05,566
No!. Maybe you've hit bottom,
but l haven't hit bottom yet!.

1096
01:21:05,967 --> 01:21:07,366
I got a ways to go!.

1097
01:21:08,647 --> 01:21:11,559
I'm gonna bounce back, and when l do...

1098
01:21:12,007 --> 01:21:15,283
...l'm gonna buy you a diamond so big...

1099
01:21:15,367 --> 01:21:17,642
...it's gonna make you puke!.

1100
01:21:18,287 --> 01:21:22,075
I don't want to puke!. I don't want wealth!.

1101
01:21:22,487 --> 01:21:25,524
I just want you like you used to be.

1102
01:21:25,767 --> 01:21:27,644
What happened to that man?

1103
01:21:27,887 --> 01:21:29,081
Me?

1104
01:21:29,607 --> 01:21:32,041
What happened to the girl l believed in?

1105
01:21:32,687 --> 01:21:34,564
The girl l fell in love with?

1106
01:21:34,647 --> 01:21:36,524
The girl that believed in me?

1107
01:21:38,167 --> 01:21:40,397
There's plenty of places l can go...

1108
01:21:40,527 --> 01:21:42,199
...where people believe in me.

1109
01:21:42,287 --> 01:21:45,199
So go. The sooner you're out of my life...

1110
01:21:45,287 --> 01:21:49,200
...the sooner l can go back to being the girl
in this little flowered dress...

1111
01:21:49,287 --> 01:21:53,280
...that you sang the "Thermos Song" to.

1112
01:21:53,727 --> 01:21:55,843
Well, l'm gonna go, then.

1113
01:21:56,487 --> 01:22:00,082
I don't need any of this!.
I don't need this stuff!.

1114
01:22:00,167 --> 01:22:03,159
And l don't need you!.
I don't need anything!.

1115
01:22:04,327 --> 01:22:05,760
Except this.

1116
01:22:06,127 --> 01:22:09,199
This ashtray.
That's the only thing l need is this!.

1117
01:22:10,727 --> 01:22:12,445
I don't need this or this!.

1118
01:22:12,607 --> 01:22:14,199
Just this ashtray!.

1119
01:22:15,527 --> 01:22:17,324
And this paddle game.

1120
01:22:18,287 --> 01:22:21,279
The ashtray and the paddle game
and that's all l need.

1121
01:22:21,607 --> 01:22:24,485
And this remote control.

1122
01:22:24,807 --> 01:22:28,686
The ashtray, the paddle game
and the remote control. That's all l need.

1123
01:22:30,767 --> 01:22:32,598
And these matches.

1124
01:22:33,607 --> 01:22:38,397
The ashtray, these matches
the remote control and the paddle ball.

1125
01:22:40,487 --> 01:22:41,761
And this lamp.

1126
01:22:43,807 --> 01:22:45,035
The ashtray...

1127
01:22:46,207 --> 01:22:49,802
...this paddle game, the remote control...

1128
01:22:51,047 --> 01:22:53,356
...and the lamp, and that's all l need.

1129
01:22:56,007 --> 01:22:57,838
And that's all l need, too!.

1130
01:22:58,687 --> 01:23:00,996
I don't need one other thing!.

1131
01:23:01,367 --> 01:23:03,278
Not one. I need this.

1132
01:23:05,287 --> 01:23:07,323
The paddle game, the chair...

1133
01:23:07,727 --> 01:23:11,686
...the remote control
and the matches, for sure.

1134
01:23:13,447 --> 01:23:15,483
What are you looking at?

1135
01:23:16,367 --> 01:23:19,962
What do you think l am,
some kind of a jerk or something?

1136
01:23:26,167 --> 01:23:27,156
And this.

1137
01:23:29,207 --> 01:23:30,799
That's all l need.

1138
01:23:31,687 --> 01:23:36,442
Except the ashtray,
the remote control, the paddle game...

1139
01:23:36,527 --> 01:23:39,166
...this magazine and the chair.

1140
01:23:45,207 --> 01:23:48,916
I don't need one other thing.
Except my dog.

1141
01:23:51,847 --> 01:23:53,644
Well, l don't need my dog.

1142
01:24:59,287 --> 01:25:01,323
So, that's it.

1143
01:25:02,447 --> 01:25:06,360
It's an old story,
one you've probably heard before.

1144
01:25:08,727 --> 01:25:11,161
But l never thought it would happen to me.

1145
01:25:24,447 --> 01:25:27,564
Any of you bums
ever heard of Navin R. Johnson?

1146
01:25:30,007 --> 01:25:31,406
I've heard of him.

1147
01:25:31,607 --> 01:25:33,086
Born in Mississippi?

1148
01:25:35,167 --> 01:25:37,078
The inventor of the Opti-Grab?

1149
01:25:37,327 --> 01:25:39,636
I was just telling these guys!.

1150
01:25:41,327 --> 01:25:42,646
Son!.

1151
01:25:44,007 --> 01:25:45,201
Daddy!.

1152
01:25:46,887 --> 01:25:47,797
Navin.

1153
01:25:48,007 --> 01:25:49,520
-Mama!.
-My baby!.

1154
01:25:51,607 --> 01:25:53,802
I knew we'd find you!.

1155
01:25:55,487 --> 01:25:57,239
-Taj!.
-Don't kiss me!.

1156
01:26:02,807 --> 01:26:04,877
I called them the night you left.

1157
01:26:05,567 --> 01:26:06,920
How'd you find me?

1158
01:26:07,007 --> 01:26:09,396
I don't know.
This is the first place we looked.

1159
01:26:09,487 --> 01:26:11,876
We're taking you home
and you're living with us.

1160
01:26:11,967 --> 01:26:14,242
Turns out dad's a financial genius.

1161
01:26:14,367 --> 01:26:17,325
All l did was take the money
you sent home...

1162
01:26:17,487 --> 01:26:21,639
...and embarked on a periodic investment
in a no-load mutual fund.

1163
01:26:21,727 --> 01:26:25,481
He leveraged his ass
deep into soy beans and cocoa futures.

1164
01:26:25,807 --> 01:26:27,081
Right on.

1165
01:26:28,127 --> 01:26:30,516
I picked out this thermos for you.

1166
01:26:34,927 --> 01:26:38,283
-I'd kiss you, but l'm so dirty.
-Dirt doesn't bother me.

1167
01:26:39,767 --> 01:26:42,361
But the smell does.

1168
01:26:44,487 --> 01:26:48,196
Son, you'd better get
in the back with the dog...

1169
01:26:48,287 --> 01:26:51,199
...until we can get you hosed down.

1170
01:26:59,407 --> 01:27:03,116
-I love you, Navin!.
-I love you, too!.

1171
01:27:04,407 --> 01:27:06,045
Somebody open a window!.

1172
01:27:06,327 --> 01:27:08,204
Open all the windows.

1173
01:27:10,527 --> 01:27:12,597
I was so glad to be going home.

1174
01:27:12,767 --> 01:27:15,122
I remembered the days
when l sang and danced...

1175
01:27:15,207 --> 01:27:17,721
...with my family
on the porch ofthe old house.

1176
01:27:17,807 --> 01:27:21,516
But things change,
and with all the additions to the family...

1177
01:27:21,767 --> 01:27:25,123
...we had to tear down the old house,
even though we loved it.

1178
01:27:25,207 --> 01:27:27,084
But we built us a bigger one.

1179
01:27:27,887 --> 01:27:30,003
-"Lordy
