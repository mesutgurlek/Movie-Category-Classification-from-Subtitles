1
00:01:23,633 --> 00:01:28,195
Hi, and welcome back to
another episode of Télévision Educative.

2
00:01:28,371 --> 00:01:30,965
Tonight, l will show you
how dreams are prepared.

3
00:01:31,141 --> 00:01:33,473
People think it's a very simple
and easy process...

4
00:01:33,643 --> 00:01:36,874
...but it's a bit more
complicated than that.

5
00:01:37,046 --> 00:01:42,951
As you can see, a very delicate combination
of complex ingredients is the key.

6
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,055
First, we put in some random thoughts.

7
00:01:48,124 --> 00:01:54,393
And then we add a little bit
of reminiscences of the day...

8
00:01:55,265 --> 00:01:59,361
...mixed with some memories
from the past.

9
00:01:59,669 --> 00:02:01,330
That's for two people.

10
00:02:02,338 --> 00:02:06,900
Love, friendships, relationships,
and all those ''ships'' ...

11
00:02:07,343 --> 00:02:09,675
...together with songs you heard
during the day...

12
00:02:09,846 --> 00:02:13,646
...things you saw and also...personal.

13
00:02:13,817 --> 00:02:16,877
Okay. Okay, l think it's one.

14
00:02:17,453 --> 00:02:20,251
There it goes. Yes. Yes.

15
00:02:20,423 --> 00:02:22,584
Okay, we have to run.

16
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:29,623
l'm talking quietly to not
wake myself up.

17
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,589
l'm with my dad.

18
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:37,571
Yes, Dad. I remember.
My father was there.

19
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,800
It's nice to see him healthy
and normal again.

20
00:02:40,977 --> 00:02:43,377
I almost forgot how he looked.

21
00:02:43,546 --> 00:02:45,309
Handsome, no?

22
00:02:45,481 --> 00:02:47,847
Oh, yeah, oh yeah, we're in a concert.

23
00:02:48,017 --> 00:02:51,919
A Duke Ellington concert.
Yes, my man, Duke Ellington.

24
00:02:52,155 --> 00:02:55,784
And the band starts to play.
Bass, drums and all.

25
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:58,427
It's amazing, they got this super swing.

26
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,392
And the Duke enters the stage.

27
00:03:00,563 --> 00:03:04,397
He's radiant, in a glowing white tuxedo.

28
00:03:20,984 --> 00:03:26,980
Dad, this is not Duke Ellington,
but Duck Ellington.

29
00:03:27,156 --> 00:03:28,783
This is a dream.

30
00:03:30,827 --> 00:03:34,923
I'm sorry, Dad, but you're dead.

31
00:03:35,098 --> 00:03:37,589
You've lost the battle to cancer.

32
00:03:37,767 --> 00:03:40,895
No, no. I cried so hard.

33
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:45,530
I could feel my tears forming
two rivers under my eyes.

34
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:48,973
In dreams, emotions are overwhelming.

35
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,249
Come in, action two.
Can you complete the mission?

36
00:08:53,816 --> 00:08:55,477
Ski?

37
00:10:09,825 --> 00:10:11,656
-English very well.
-Oh, good, good.

38
00:10:11,827 --> 00:10:14,990
-Yes, picture one is a duck.
-Me too.

39
00:10:19,068 --> 00:10:21,559
Am l not supposed to design
the new calendar collection?

40
00:10:21,737 --> 00:10:22,795
No, no, l'm afraid not.

41
00:10:24,974 --> 00:10:27,499
Because my mother,
she told me this was a creative job.

42
00:10:27,677 --> 00:10:29,269
This doesn't look creative at all.

43
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,908
You know,
l think there's a misunderstanding.

44
00:10:33,082 --> 00:10:34,344
Can l see?

45
00:10:34,517 --> 00:10:35,950
-Sure.
-Yeah?

46
00:10:44,794 --> 00:10:45,783
This is nice.

47
00:10:45,961 --> 00:10:48,327
Yeah, not bad, eh?

48
00:10:48,497 --> 00:10:49,930
l'll tell you what.

49
00:10:50,099 --> 00:10:53,159
Take the portfolio and
let's talk to the big boss here, okay?

50
00:10:54,603 --> 00:10:56,093
The collection is crap anyway.

51
00:10:56,272 --> 00:10:59,435
Welcome in this palace, Stéphane.

52
00:10:59,608 --> 00:11:01,838
Stéphane is a great artist
with a foreign accent.

53
00:11:02,011 --> 00:11:03,444
He'd like to suggest something.

54
00:11:03,612 --> 00:11:06,945
What about the ski weekend?
Did you put him on the list?

55
00:11:07,116 --> 00:11:11,143
You see, Stéphane, it's very, very important
to stimulate the team spirit.

56
00:11:11,787 --> 00:11:13,220
Martine.

57
00:11:17,727 --> 00:11:21,356
You should show him your work, okay?
Be brave, Stéphane.

58
00:11:23,699 --> 00:11:26,133
Well, it's still a bit of a work in progress.

59
00:11:26,302 --> 00:11:29,294
l've done 1 2 paintings for a calendar.

60
00:11:33,042 --> 00:11:36,034
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.

61
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:40,639
We will be reaching Paris' Charles de Gaulle
in 6 hours and 45 minutes.

62
00:11:40,816 --> 00:11:43,216
Please enjoy the flight,
fasten your seat belts...

63
00:11:43,386 --> 00:11:47,186
...and if you have any questions,
please don't hesitate to:

64
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,117
The pilot will never finish the sentence.

65
00:11:52,561 --> 00:11:56,759
Flight 800, on July 1 7th, 1 996...

66
00:11:56,932 --> 00:11:59,127
...disappears from the sky.

67
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:02,737
Spraying its 230 passengers
all over the North Atlantic.

68
00:12:03,439 --> 00:12:05,737
The whole world is in shock.

69
00:12:08,043 --> 00:12:09,908
Quiet morning,
like any other morning.

70
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:15,277
A huge earthquake
rattles the center of the town.

71
00:12:15,451 --> 00:12:20,479
Each month has its own
most infamous disaster event...

72
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,681
...engraved in the collective memory.

73
00:12:22,858 --> 00:12:27,158
lt's a concept l've been trying to
work on and developing.

74
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:28,762
lt's called disasterology.

75
00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:30,990
Stéphane, you are not serious.

76
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,328
Oh, l am very serious.

77
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:36,403
lt's the customer that needs
a little bit of a sense of humor.

78
00:12:36,572 --> 00:12:39,632
My customers don't have
any sense of humor.

79
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:45,206
They want puppies, trucks,
flowers or nudes. That's all.

80
00:12:45,381 --> 00:12:48,839
Come on, Guy, show him his work.
lt's getting late now.

81
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,918
Come on, Stéphane, let's go.

82
00:13:00,463 --> 00:13:01,691
You shave with a cracker?

83
00:13:19,815 --> 00:13:22,409
Oh, you little asshole!

84
00:14:14,136 --> 00:14:17,537
Sorry, no. No, no, no.
l need a break. No, no, no.

85
00:14:17,706 --> 00:14:20,641
No, no, l need a little break.
Serge, l need a little break.

86
00:14:20,809 --> 00:14:21,969
Guy, just a tiny one.

87
00:14:34,657 --> 00:14:36,420
La pampa is in Argentina, you idiot!

88
00:14:36,926 --> 00:14:39,690
What about Yucatán, Palenque, Kerala?

89
00:15:02,384 --> 00:15:04,113
Get out.

90
00:16:07,082 --> 00:16:10,074
Come in, action two.
Can you complete the mission?

91
00:16:10,986 --> 00:16:14,319
Come in, action two.
Can you complete the mission?

92
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:17,891
Come in, action two.
Can you complete the mission?

93
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,552
Come in, action two.
Can you complete the mission?

94
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,722
Come in, action two.
Can you complete the mission?

95
00:16:25,267 --> 00:16:27,861
Come in, action two.
Can you complete the mission?

96
00:16:28,037 --> 00:16:30,301
lt's 7:30.

97
00:16:35,144 --> 00:16:36,236
Hello?

98
00:16:39,148 --> 00:16:41,241
Are you trying to mock me on the air?

99
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,351
A creative job,
ls that what you call it?

100
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,303
No, Mam-- Mama. Mama!

101
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:27,853
Excuse me for this interruption.

102
00:17:30,032 --> 00:17:32,660
Yeah, that's my father.

103
00:18:25,387 --> 00:18:28,049
P.S.R.:

104
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:33,559
Parallel synchronized randomness.

105
00:18:35,097 --> 00:18:39,761
An interesting brain rarity
and our subject for today.

106
00:18:41,603 --> 00:18:45,562
Two people walk in opposite directions
at the same time...

107
00:18:45,741 --> 00:18:49,734
...and then they make the same decision
at the same time.

108
00:18:49,912 --> 00:18:52,346
Then they correct it,
and then they correct it...

109
00:18:52,514 --> 00:18:55,642
...and then they correct it
and then they correct it....

110
00:18:55,818 --> 00:18:58,116
Basically, in a mathematical world...

111
00:18:58,287 --> 00:19:01,381
...these two little guys will
stay looped for the end of time.

112
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:04,390
The brain is the most complex thing
in the universe...

113
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,585
...and it's right behind the nose.

114
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,160
Fascinating!

115
00:19:12,201 --> 00:19:14,533
l'm sorry, l'm sorry.
l'm sorry about this.

116
00:19:14,703 --> 00:19:16,000
Stay calm.

117
00:19:16,171 --> 00:19:20,870
l think that's just that they are
renovating the studio right behind here.

118
00:20:41,924 --> 00:20:43,824
-You are Spanish, no?
-No.

119
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:45,425
-No?
-l'm from Mexico.

120
00:20:45,594 --> 00:20:47,221
But my mother is French.

121
00:20:47,396 --> 00:20:51,765
Yeah, l just came here because
my father died of cancer.

122
00:20:55,037 --> 00:20:58,632
Okay. You know,
that looks pretty bad.

123
00:21:02,811 --> 00:21:04,472
You think l have to go
to the hospital?

124
00:21:04,646 --> 00:21:08,138
Beause it's not looking that good....

125
00:21:18,827 --> 00:21:20,055
Good stuff for you.

126
00:21:22,931 --> 00:21:24,489
Okay?

127
00:21:27,502 --> 00:21:29,766
-lt's strong.
-lt's mint. lt's mint.

128
00:21:31,907 --> 00:21:34,876
-Yeah, l feel it working already.
-Yeah? Okay.

129
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:40,347
-So, what's your name?
-Stéphane.

130
00:21:40,515 --> 00:21:42,983
Stéphane? Stéphanie.

131
00:21:43,585 --> 00:21:45,450
Stéphane, Stéphanie.
Stéphanie, Stéphane.

132
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:48,453
Click-clack, catch, match.
She has no boyfriend.

133
00:21:50,859 --> 00:21:53,987
-And you? You...?
-Zoé.

134
00:21:54,629 --> 00:21:57,189
You know,
Stéphanie is a talented composer.

135
00:21:57,366 --> 00:22:00,824
-You should hear what she makes.
-That's bullshit. l never play it.

136
00:22:01,003 --> 00:22:04,530
You know, a pretty girl with talent,
that deserves to be mentioned.

137
00:22:04,706 --> 00:22:06,230
Yeah.

138
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,137
And what's your job?

139
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:11,905
l'm a promotional calendar
maquettiste. Yeah, it's--

140
00:22:47,182 --> 00:22:48,479
That's typical from Sylvain.

141
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:51,448
He asks you to help and then
he lets you do all the work.

142
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,588
l am sorry.

143
00:22:59,895 --> 00:23:04,264
So what does it mean exactly,
promotional calendar maquettist?

144
00:23:04,433 --> 00:23:09,029
Maquettiste. lt's--
l don't know.

145
00:23:10,906 --> 00:23:13,568
l don't know. lt's really boring, actually.

146
00:23:13,742 --> 00:23:16,643
But l mean, there's one profession
l really wanna pursue...

147
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,302
...which is inventor.

148
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,381
-lnventing what?
-Well, l can show you.

149
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:24,246
l have some glasses...

150
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:26,853
...where you can see real life in 3-D.

151
00:23:27,022 --> 00:23:29,217
lsn't life already in 3-D?

152
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:32,149
No-- Yeah, but--

153
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:35,524
Come on, l mean,
Do you wanna-- Do you wanna try it?

154
00:23:36,131 --> 00:23:38,099
This, for example:

155
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,497
Look, look, look.

156
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:46,163
-lt works, no?
-Yeah, yeah.

157
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:55,145
You know Pulfrich, the guy who
discovered the 3-D effect?

158
00:23:55,317 --> 00:23:56,807
He had only one eye.

159
00:23:56,985 --> 00:24:00,079
And that makes him, like, the Beethoven
of the stereo, you know?

160
00:24:03,058 --> 00:24:06,186
And what do you girls do?
Are you students or work?

161
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:08,989
-No, we're--
-No, we're creative executives.

162
00:24:09,164 --> 00:24:12,930
We're going to concerts
and we find bands to sign.

163
00:24:13,101 --> 00:24:14,125
To sign what?

164
00:24:14,302 --> 00:24:16,293
Oh, she means that we're working
in music.

165
00:24:17,139 --> 00:24:18,606
What company?

166
00:24:19,107 --> 00:24:21,166
Aristotle.

167
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,837
Like, as the turtle, no?

168
00:24:24,012 --> 00:24:26,480
No, no, no.
Like the philosopher. You know?

169
00:24:35,023 --> 00:24:36,251
l'm gonna go.

170
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:47,462
How do you know Sylvain?

171
00:24:49,304 --> 00:24:50,965
-Sylvain?
-Yeah.

172
00:24:51,139 --> 00:24:53,801
-From Mexico. Yeah.
-Oh, Mexico.

173
00:24:53,975 --> 00:24:55,738
He never said anything about it.

174
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:58,471
No? l don't know why. Bye-bye.

175
00:24:58,647 --> 00:25:01,810
-You want us to drive you back?
-No, l'm okay.

176
00:25:21,236 --> 00:25:26,640
To screw. Maybe yes, maybe no.

177
00:25:26,808 --> 00:25:29,971
Maybe rain, maybe snow.

178
00:25:30,145 --> 00:25:31,669
Okay, baby.

179
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:44,683
lt's three times this week
he puts his ass on the poubelle.

180
00:25:47,762 --> 00:25:50,230
-We're not gonna wait for them?
-No, no, no.

181
00:26:02,677 --> 00:26:06,807
l can't believe that my mother lied
about the job just to get me over here.

182
00:26:07,215 --> 00:26:10,343
lt's completely unethical to do that
to your own son. lt's horrible.

183
00:26:10,518 --> 00:26:13,419
lt's the worst job l've ever had
in my life.

184
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:17,180
Your predecessor....

185
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:20,123
He committed suicide
two weeks ago.

186
00:26:20,462 --> 00:26:22,054
No.

187
00:26:22,397 --> 00:26:24,888
No. l'm joking.

188
00:26:25,867 --> 00:26:28,392
No, he left after two weeks.

189
00:26:29,404 --> 00:26:33,272
Come on, man, just get along with
the job and we'll have some fun.

190
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:38,445
Do you think Martine is pretty?

191
00:26:38,947 --> 00:26:40,574
Martine? From work?

192
00:26:40,749 --> 00:26:43,650
No, Martin Scorsese. Yeah.

193
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:47,215
l don't-- l don't think about that.

194
00:26:47,389 --> 00:26:48,981
Well, imagine...

195
00:26:49,157 --> 00:26:52,217
...if she comes and gives you a blowjob
in the darkroom....

196
00:26:52,394 --> 00:26:54,157
You know, l can arrange this for you.

197
00:26:54,329 --> 00:26:58,595
So getting laid is all that matters?
lt doesn't matter who the person is?

198
00:26:58,767 --> 00:27:02,203
You see, l'm not a creative person,
like you.

199
00:27:03,305 --> 00:27:06,468
l don't feel the need to leave a trace
behind me...

200
00:27:07,842 --> 00:27:10,402
...except a fart sometimes.

201
00:27:11,179 --> 00:27:15,479
Sorry. lt escaped me. Come on.

202
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:18,210
You know, the other day, l saw
an old man on the bench.

203
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:20,320
He was smiling, you know, really happy.

204
00:27:20,488 --> 00:27:22,456
You know what he was thinking of?

205
00:27:22,657 --> 00:27:23,851
His grandchildren?

206
00:27:24,025 --> 00:27:26,858
Not at all.
lf you don't know, don't improvise.

207
00:27:27,028 --> 00:27:30,054
No, he was thinking about all the dirty
stuff and naughty stuff...

208
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:32,199
...he did with the girls
when he was young.

209
00:27:32,367 --> 00:27:35,234
How do you know that?
Did you ask him?

210
00:27:36,204 --> 00:27:38,900
l know that because...

211
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:41,702
...this man was me in the future.
And l was happy.

212
00:27:41,876 --> 00:27:44,367
l simply want to be like him
in my old days.

213
00:27:45,447 --> 00:27:48,109
You know, l have this neighbor
that has a friend...

214
00:27:48,283 --> 00:27:49,978
...that is very pretty, actually.

215
00:27:50,151 --> 00:27:52,642
Oh, good reason to stay, my man.

216
00:27:52,821 --> 00:27:55,813
Be careful, you know,
with the whole neighbor situation.

217
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:59,118
That's the problem, that l think
it's the neighbor that likes me...

218
00:27:59,294 --> 00:28:00,454
...not her friend.

219
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,993
-Yeah.
-Danger.

220
00:28:05,333 --> 00:28:07,528
l never get the one l like, anyways.

221
00:28:07,702 --> 00:28:09,533
Maybe she's a good cook.

222
00:28:14,709 --> 00:28:18,304
-Stéphane? Did you forget something?
-Hey. Hi.

223
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,746
No, no. l was just-- l was just--

224
00:28:22,917 --> 00:28:25,647
You know, my hand? Because l can--

225
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:29,187
Are you looking for Zoé?
She's not here.

226
00:28:29,357 --> 00:28:32,724
-She doesn't live here, you know?
-Oh, okay.

227
00:28:32,894 --> 00:28:35,522
How's your dad--? Your hand.

228
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:38,324
My dad? My dad's still dead.

229
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,524
l'm sorry.

230
00:28:43,104 --> 00:28:44,731
You want Zoé's number?

231
00:28:44,906 --> 00:28:48,205
No. No, l think l'm fine.

232
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:52,177
-So l guess l'll be on my way now.
-Okay.

233
00:28:52,347 --> 00:28:53,746
Bye.

234
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:01,683
l'll do my laundry later. Maybe l should
check this hand of yours.

235
00:29:02,891 --> 00:29:07,260
Okay, well, yeah,
it's better to be safe than sorry.

236
00:29:14,202 --> 00:29:15,635
Sorry, it's not funny.

237
00:29:15,804 --> 00:29:18,102
l think it's funny.
l mean, it's not that funny--

238
00:29:18,273 --> 00:29:20,571
l mean, it's not funny,
but l find it funny.

239
00:29:23,044 --> 00:29:24,909
Come in.

240
00:29:29,217 --> 00:29:31,412
lt's still chaos.

241
00:29:34,589 --> 00:29:38,320
l'm going to put my bed up there,
to save some space.

242
00:29:38,493 --> 00:29:41,189
How do you call it? A ''mezzanine''?

243
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:43,853
Mezzanine, oui, mezzanine.

244
00:29:46,768 --> 00:29:48,929
Do you make those?

245
00:29:49,103 --> 00:29:51,970
Some l made and others l adopted.

246
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,801
You have to find who.

247
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:58,845
-You made this one.
-Nope.

248
00:29:59,113 --> 00:30:00,944
What's his name?

249
00:30:01,316 --> 00:30:03,443
His name is...

250
00:30:04,185 --> 00:30:06,415
...Golden the Pony Boy.

251
00:30:06,588 --> 00:30:11,548
When l found him, he was so sad
that l had to buy him for a lot.

252
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:14,853
-He's never going to leave me now.
-Really?

253
00:30:15,029 --> 00:30:16,826
l understand that you're the mother...

254
00:30:16,998 --> 00:30:19,296
...but you also have to think
of his interest.

255
00:30:19,467 --> 00:30:21,765
Yeah, it's possible.
But he is already damaged.

256
00:30:21,936 --> 00:30:24,268
l can't take any chances.

257
00:30:24,439 --> 00:30:25,929
Let me see your hand.

258
00:30:29,177 --> 00:30:32,613
You know, it started to smell like a foot.

259
00:30:34,182 --> 00:30:36,173
lt's a good sign.

260
00:30:42,123 --> 00:30:43,715
Can you move it?

261
00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:49,257
Yeah. Well, it hurts a little bit,
but it's okay.

262
00:30:50,498 --> 00:30:53,467
-l have too big hands.
-Yeah?

263
00:30:53,635 --> 00:30:55,500
That means you have a large penis.

264
00:30:57,238 --> 00:30:59,365
l'm sorry, that was a bit inappropriate.

265
00:30:59,541 --> 00:31:02,533
Look, l'll show you a trick.
lt's a brain effect.

266
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:05,076
You have to-- You have to do this:

267
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:07,539
Okay.

268
00:31:10,351 --> 00:31:14,048
lt feels so weird. lt feels like if it
wasn't my hand.

269
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:18,157
l know one that you have to....

270
00:31:18,326 --> 00:31:20,317
You have to put your two fingers
like this:

271
00:31:20,495 --> 00:31:22,725
...and then you look into the distance,
like that:

272
00:31:22,897 --> 00:31:25,457
-All you can see is a little--
-A little sausage, yeah.

273
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:27,157
l know it. lt's a good one.

274
00:31:27,335 --> 00:31:29,269
Oh, you know it?

275
00:31:35,443 --> 00:31:37,308
l made this boat in fabric.

276
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:42,245
l have to put it
in a small forest as a setup.

277
00:31:42,717 --> 00:31:46,346
The boat is looking for its mer,
which is--

278
00:31:46,521 --> 00:31:50,082
lt sounds like both ''mother''
and ''sea'' in French.

279
00:31:50,258 --> 00:31:52,726
So the forest inside the boat?

280
00:31:52,894 --> 00:31:55,727
That's genius.
That's like a vegetable Noah's Arc.

281
00:31:55,897 --> 00:31:59,298
No, no, no, the boat is in the forest,
looking for his mer.

282
00:31:59,467 --> 00:32:02,402
But l need to make the trees, though.

283
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:05,164
Okay, but you know, the forest
inside the boat...

284
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,069
...that's a really good idea.

285
00:32:07,241 --> 00:32:09,436
l think that maybe
you wanna do that instead.

286
00:32:10,378 --> 00:32:14,109
Yeah, yeah. Okay, l'll do it.
lt sounds like a good idea.

287
00:32:14,282 --> 00:32:16,409
Okay, so l'll go get my dad's
old camera...

288
00:32:16,584 --> 00:32:19,747
...and we can make an animated film
of the forest inside the boat...

289
00:32:19,921 --> 00:32:22,048
...looking for its mother.

290
00:32:22,223 --> 00:32:25,249
And the leaves grow and the wind
catches in them...

291
00:32:25,426 --> 00:32:28,156
...then the boat takes off.
You'll make the sea, okay?

292
00:32:28,329 --> 00:32:33,596
Okay, yeah. Well, we can do it with
layers of paper, like this:

293
00:32:34,402 --> 00:32:37,838
You know, like this and they move
in opposite directions, you know?

294
00:32:39,574 --> 00:32:44,534
Yeah. Yeah, but we have to find
something more special then.

295
00:32:44,779 --> 00:32:48,442
Kind of retarded in a way.
Look.

296
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:57,021
-Cellophane.
-Cellophane.

297
00:32:57,191 --> 00:32:59,318
Yeah. Yeah, like a Russian
animated film.

298
00:32:59,994 --> 00:33:02,895
My mother, she collects thousands
of bonbon wrapping paper...

299
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:06,192
...and also cardboard tubes.
We've got boxes full of them at home.

300
00:33:06,367 --> 00:33:07,732
What for?

301
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:10,837
She used to do this arts and crafts
thing and other projects...

302
00:33:11,005 --> 00:33:12,597
...but she never finished them.

303
00:33:12,774 --> 00:33:15,334
l actually can't stand it,
she never finishes anything.

304
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:19,241
-And look, for the clouds.
-Oh, yeah.

305
00:33:20,181 --> 00:33:23,014
Oh, no, no, no. No, try it again.
Try it again, wrong chord.

306
00:33:24,786 --> 00:33:26,720
No, wrong chord, try it again.

307
00:33:28,356 --> 00:33:31,484
l knew it. l knew it!

308
00:33:31,659 --> 00:33:34,719
Each structure has its own resonant
frequency.

309
00:33:34,896 --> 00:33:37,990
You just have to hit the right chord
at the right time.

310
00:33:38,166 --> 00:33:41,101
Okay, l'll go get the camera
and you go do the forest.

311
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:44,329
Whoa, whoa, whoa, by the time
you get back, l'll be sleeping.

312
00:33:44,505 --> 00:33:46,700
And l need to finish the boat, anyway.

313
00:33:46,874 --> 00:33:49,968
You bring the camera next time, okay?

314
00:33:50,678 --> 00:33:55,206
Okay. Well, you tell me when to bring
the camera, okay?

315
00:33:56,718 --> 00:33:58,982
Well, l'm leaving.

316
00:33:59,153 --> 00:34:01,246
l'll start the forest tomorrow.

317
00:34:01,422 --> 00:34:02,719
All right.

318
00:34:05,059 --> 00:34:06,424
Bye.

319
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:18,471
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

320
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:18,824
No, no, Martine.
Martine, no. No, no.

321
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,831
l'm sorry, l can't.

322
00:35:21,002 --> 00:35:23,402
lt's-- lt's not you, it's me.
l feel guilty.

323
00:35:23,571 --> 00:35:25,402
What is it, Stéphanou?

324
00:35:25,573 --> 00:35:28,565
l can't live all my life
hiding in my apartment.

325
00:35:28,743 --> 00:35:30,734
-l need to come clean.
-You are clean.

326
00:35:30,912 --> 00:35:34,871
Aristurtle? Okay, okay.
Type this:

327
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:36,311
Dear Stéphanie:

328
00:35:36,484 --> 00:35:39,453
-''Dear Stéph--'' Who is she?
-l am....

329
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:42,248
Forget about it, l need to write it
in French anyway.

330
00:35:42,423 --> 00:35:43,913
Okay.

331
00:36:11,185 --> 00:36:14,882
By the way, do you have Zoé's
phone number?

332
00:36:15,056 --> 00:36:18,958
Thanks, Stéphane.

333
00:36:19,861 --> 00:36:22,159
Where are you going now?

334
00:36:24,198 --> 00:36:26,496
Stéphanou?

335
00:36:51,492 --> 00:36:54,188
No, no, no.

336
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,179
''Do you have Zoé's phone number?''

337
00:37:23,357 --> 00:37:26,417
Dear Stéphanie, comma.

338
00:37:26,594 --> 00:37:30,086
I am just your neighbor,
there is nothing more to say than that.

339
00:37:30,965 --> 00:37:33,798
This is the reason why I am writing
a letter to you...

340
00:37:33,968 --> 00:37:38,837
...because I feel really bad inside
my stomach.

341
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:40,598
It's a mix between--

342
00:37:40,775 --> 00:37:43,437
l don't know if what l feel is a bit
of nostalgia...

343
00:37:43,611 --> 00:37:46,478
...or wanting to go to the bathroom.

344
00:37:46,647 --> 00:37:50,105
l am just a new liar in your life.

345
00:37:50,284 --> 00:37:54,721
A new liar that has come
and destroyed your piano...

346
00:37:54,889 --> 00:37:58,620
...and maybe by doing that destroy
the huge heritage....

347
00:37:58,793 --> 00:38:02,354
I want us to start a new start
and a new--

348
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:06,057
A new blank page of friendship.

349
00:38:06,233 --> 00:38:10,135
And if you can embrace that the same
way I am embracing it right now...

350
00:38:10,304 --> 00:38:13,171
...that l am feeling it right now,
l see the possibilities...

351
00:38:13,341 --> 00:38:18,335
...once we go above that threshold
of life...

352
00:38:18,512 --> 00:38:21,538
...and matters that succumb
and become trickling down...

353
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:24,981
...into this little pond
that is called life.

354
00:38:25,186 --> 00:38:27,780
Full stop. The end.

355
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,752
Stéphanie?

356
00:40:08,456 --> 00:40:10,083
Stéphanie?

357
00:40:13,427 --> 00:40:15,759
-Stéphanie.
-Stéphanie.

358
00:40:37,985 --> 00:40:40,385
Stéphanie and Zoé lied to me.

359
00:40:40,554 --> 00:40:42,954
They are not
creative executives. No! No.

360
00:40:43,124 --> 00:40:45,115
Aristotle, my ass.

361
00:40:45,292 --> 00:40:46,725
They think l'm stupid, but no.

362
00:40:46,894 --> 00:40:48,919
You guys are gonna
help me find them, okay?

363
00:40:50,798 --> 00:40:53,323
-Stéphane needs you.
-Okay.

364
00:40:53,501 --> 00:40:55,594
-We've gotta find a way of--
-Go back to work.

365
00:40:55,769 --> 00:40:57,430
Oh, no. To work? No, no, no.

366
00:40:57,605 --> 00:41:00,267
lt's only a dream.
We don't have to work in dreams.

367
00:41:00,441 --> 00:41:03,968
-No! Nothing is for real.
-You write, you write.

368
00:41:04,145 --> 00:41:05,874
-You write!
-You're just the result...

369
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:08,446
...of a chemical flux in my brain,
that's all.

370
00:41:09,316 --> 00:41:11,079
Do you mean we don't really exist?

371
00:41:11,752 --> 00:41:12,844
Flux?

372
00:42:14,515 --> 00:42:16,745
By the way,
do you have Zoé's number?

373
00:43:39,733 --> 00:43:40,859
Hello?

374
00:43:41,068 --> 00:43:42,228
Hello?

375
00:43:42,403 --> 00:43:43,495
Stéphane Miroux?

376
00:43:44,805 --> 00:43:47,273
-Stéphanie?
-Yes.

377
00:43:47,441 --> 00:43:48,840
Hey.

378
00:43:50,744 --> 00:43:52,735
Did you finish the boat already?

379
00:43:54,782 --> 00:43:56,545
No, no, of course not.

380
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:59,277
l still have some stuff to buy.

381
00:44:15,369 --> 00:44:16,631
Optical tricks.

382
00:44:19,873 --> 00:44:21,397
Yeah.

383
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:26,205
Yeah, l could show you one.
l got this really cool one. When?

384
00:44:28,882 --> 00:44:30,406
Now?

385
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:32,650
Okay.

386
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:38,080
It'll take me, like,
35 minutes to get there.

387
00:44:40,561 --> 00:44:44,327
Maybe-- l mean,
maybe l can make it in 1 5.

388
00:44:44,498 --> 00:44:46,830
-Yeah, okay.
-Yeah?

389
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,934
-Okay.
-Okay, bye.

390
00:45:34,915 --> 00:45:36,382
-Hi.
-Hi.

391
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:38,575
-You were quick.
-Yeah.

392
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,449
l brought you this.

393
00:45:41,622 --> 00:45:45,023
So basically, with cards, what we do,
l mean, because...

394
00:45:45,192 --> 00:45:48,821
...it's kind of difficult. The cards
are there. The cards do not lie, you know.

395
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,725
lt cannot change.

396
00:45:50,898 --> 00:45:54,163
So if you grab the cards
and you open them...

397
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:57,735
...and you name one card
and l point at it from a distance, okay?

398
00:45:57,905 --> 00:46:00,874
But remember to send it to me, you know,
before you name it.

399
00:46:01,041 --> 00:46:04,306
Send it to me, name it, send, name,
send, name, send.

400
00:46:04,478 --> 00:46:06,844
-Okay.
-Send it.

401
00:46:11,985 --> 00:46:15,216
Okay. Yeah, l received it. lt's there.

402
00:46:15,389 --> 00:46:16,856
Yup.

403
00:46:18,091 --> 00:46:20,992
-You saw that? Did you see that?
-lt's amazing.

404
00:46:21,161 --> 00:46:22,594
Try another one.

405
00:46:24,631 --> 00:46:27,657
Ace of spades is there.

406
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:30,960
Yeah.

407
00:46:45,252 --> 00:46:47,015
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

408
00:46:47,187 --> 00:46:49,212
-What?
-What are you doing dressed like that?

409
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:51,084
lt's punk.

410
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:04,560
He's Guy. l work with him.

411
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:06,069
-We work together.
-He's what?

412
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,502
-Guy.
-Guy.

413
00:47:07,674 --> 00:47:09,039
He's punk.

414
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:12,371
So? What?

415
00:47:21,488 --> 00:47:23,479
Does she always dance like that?

416
00:47:24,625 --> 00:47:27,423
Yes. Always.

417
00:47:28,128 --> 00:47:34,192
Yeah? ls it only when she gets a bit drunk
or is it always like that?

418
00:47:34,368 --> 00:47:37,462
-Do you mind?
-No, l have no problem. l have no problem.

419
00:47:37,638 --> 00:47:41,665
l mean, l can't imagine how anyone would
end up doing that with Guy, you know?

420
00:47:42,843 --> 00:47:48,179
Hey, l composed this piece of music
for your piano.

421
00:47:48,348 --> 00:47:50,908
You could play it all night.

422
00:47:51,084 --> 00:47:52,176
Try it.

423
00:47:52,352 --> 00:47:55,480
-lt's called, ''My Dear Neighbors.''
-Thank you.

424
00:47:56,156 --> 00:47:58,522
-lt's sweet.
-l hope you like it.

425
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:03,118
-Hey.
-Hey.

426
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:05,094
What are you doing? What are you doing?

427
00:48:05,265 --> 00:48:06,732
What am l doing? You confuse me.

428
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:09,095
So you like her or you like Zoé?

429
00:48:09,269 --> 00:48:11,430
Man, l'm just talking to her.
She's my neighbor.

430
00:48:11,605 --> 00:48:15,041
We're just friends. Don't you believe
in friendship with the opposite sex?

431
00:48:15,208 --> 00:48:19,042
No. She likes you, it's obvious.
Don't play with her.

432
00:48:19,546 --> 00:48:22,310
l mean, she's great, you know.
She's a really nice person...

433
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:24,575
...but she reminds me of my father.

434
00:48:24,751 --> 00:48:26,742
-What?
-Yeah, yeah.

435
00:48:32,059 --> 00:48:33,492
Hey, we're going now.

436
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,184
Bye-bye, bye-bye.

437
00:48:35,629 --> 00:48:37,358
Bye-bye.

438
00:48:39,132 --> 00:48:42,829
Hey, don't forget
the forest and the boat, eh?

439
00:48:43,971 --> 00:48:45,461
Okay, l won't.

440
00:48:45,639 --> 00:48:47,038
-Okay.
-Be a good boy.

441
00:48:47,207 --> 00:48:49,107
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, good, okay.

442
00:48:49,743 --> 00:48:51,040
Bye.

443
00:49:22,776 --> 00:49:24,437
Stéphanie?

444
00:49:25,612 --> 00:49:27,375
Stéphanie.

445
00:49:27,781 --> 00:49:29,305
Stéph--

446
00:49:29,483 --> 00:49:30,973
You're fired. Guy, you're fired.

447
00:49:31,151 --> 00:49:33,449
You're fired. Do you hear me?
Do you hear me?

448
00:49:34,287 --> 00:49:36,016
You're dogs. You're like the--

449
00:49:36,189 --> 00:49:40,182
The dogs that bite the hand
of the owner that gives you food.

450
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:42,055
Serge, you betrayed me.

451
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:44,197
Guy, are you betraying me?

452
00:50:05,719 --> 00:50:09,211
Television Educative is back for you
this evening for a new chapter.

453
00:50:09,389 --> 00:50:11,289
Love after 50.

454
00:50:11,458 --> 00:50:14,188
We have two very special guests
on the show today.

455
00:50:14,361 --> 00:50:16,522
Gérard and Mom.

456
00:50:16,697 --> 00:50:19,325
Gérard, you are a professional magician.

457
00:50:19,499 --> 00:50:22,229
You look old and you live
in a small suburban house.

458
00:50:22,402 --> 00:50:24,097
Why do you think Mom chose you?

459
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:26,967
Oh, yes, you're funny. Yes.

460
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,852
l wouldn't like to be
the woman you cut in half.

461
00:50:45,358 --> 00:50:47,189
But hold on.

462
00:50:50,430 --> 00:50:51,522
Okay, then.

463
00:51:27,968 --> 00:51:30,698
Gérard, you're just a bullshit guru.

464
00:51:31,037 --> 00:51:33,870
Mom, why do you
always fall for gurus?

465
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:36,600
You think you will learn
some deep truth about yourself?

466
00:51:37,444 --> 00:51:38,877
My dad was not a guru.

467
00:51:41,114 --> 00:51:42,741
Are you in love, Stéphane?

468
00:51:48,288 --> 00:51:51,189
Stéphane? Stéphane?

469
00:51:52,058 --> 00:51:55,357
No, no. No.

470
00:51:58,799 --> 00:52:01,097
Do you know what REM means?

471
00:52:01,268 --> 00:52:03,566
Rapid Eye Monitronics.

472
00:52:17,651 --> 00:52:19,175
The eyes.

473
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:21,947
l can control my eyes in my sleep.

474
00:52:22,355 --> 00:52:24,516
No more sleeping slavery.

475
00:52:33,333 --> 00:52:35,927
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are approaching the moon-- What?

476
00:52:36,102 --> 00:52:37,865
The moon, yeah.

477
00:52:41,274 --> 00:52:42,673
Scary, huh?

478
00:52:42,843 --> 00:52:44,470
lt's very scary, huh?

479
00:52:45,812 --> 00:52:47,871
No gravitation pull.

480
00:52:57,490 --> 00:53:00,391
Earthquake and fire!

481
00:53:08,869 --> 00:53:10,564
Okay, that's enough. That's enough.

482
00:53:11,338 --> 00:53:14,830
Please, give us our--
l mean, your world back.

483
00:53:15,008 --> 00:53:17,476
Tell us what to do.
We'll do anything.

484
00:53:17,644 --> 00:53:19,908
Just don't make me work
like a slave all the time.

485
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:21,206
-Okay.
-Okay?

486
00:53:22,182 --> 00:53:24,116
-Master.
-Okay.

487
00:53:24,818 --> 00:53:27,616
-Peace.
-Okay. Okay.

488
00:53:45,872 --> 00:53:47,965
-Hallelujah!
-Hallelujah!

489
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:10,554
-Praise to you and to the new world.
-No, no, stop that.

490
00:54:10,730 --> 00:54:12,755
Hey, no, no. Guys, no.
Stop that shit, okay?

491
00:54:12,933 --> 00:54:14,161
lt's getting a bit creepy.

492
00:54:14,434 --> 00:54:16,231
Are we still making calendars?

493
00:54:16,403 --> 00:54:17,631
We are here to serve you.

494
00:54:17,804 --> 00:54:20,034
Basically, l wanna
see Stéphanie in my dreams.

495
00:54:20,206 --> 00:54:24,199
l know. l will make your novel,
I am Just Your Neighbor, into a bestseller.

496
00:54:24,377 --> 00:54:28,211
-That will attract her.
-Then we'll organize a massive wedding.

497
00:54:28,381 --> 00:54:30,440
Madame Stéphanie Stéphane.

498
00:54:34,921 --> 00:54:38,948
Stéphane Miroux, your novel
I'm Just Your Neighbor and a Liar.

499
00:54:39,125 --> 00:54:42,117
By the Way, Do You Have Zoé's Number?
is a blockbuster.

500
00:54:42,295 --> 00:54:44,627
-Yeah.
-Where does your genius end?

501
00:54:44,798 --> 00:54:48,825
Painting, sculpturing,
architecturing, writering?

502
00:54:49,002 --> 00:54:52,563
Today, building has began on the
Stéphane Miroux Foundation.

503
00:54:52,739 --> 00:54:54,604
A museum dedicated to your work.

504
00:54:54,774 --> 00:54:57,641
So, Stéphane Miroux,
did you find the key to success?

505
00:54:58,411 --> 00:54:59,844
Well....

506
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:05,079
Well, l think people empathize
with what l do...

507
00:55:05,251 --> 00:55:07,310
...because it comes from here.

508
00:55:07,487 --> 00:55:09,478
Oh, you are talking about Stéphanie?

509
00:55:09,656 --> 00:55:12,216
Oh, l don't like to talk
about my private life.

510
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:15,828
So, Stéphane Miroux,
we have a little surprise for you to do.

511
00:55:15,996 --> 00:55:16,985
No.

512
00:55:17,163 --> 00:55:19,358
-A song for her.
-A song?

513
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:36,708
If you rescue me

514
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:41,815
I'll be your friend forever

515
00:55:42,522 --> 00:55:46,424
Let me in your bed

516
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:51,487
I'll keep you warm in winter

517
00:55:51,898 --> 00:55:56,426
All the kitties are playing
And they're having such fun

518
00:55:56,870 --> 00:56:00,738
I wish it could happen to me

519
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:05,070
But if you rescue me

520
00:56:10,850 --> 00:56:12,715
All the cars drive so fast

521
00:56:12,886 --> 00:56:17,016
Stéphane Miroux. Stéphane Miroux.

522
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:19,622
Stéphane Miroux.

523
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,525
Let me into your world

524
00:56:21,694 --> 00:56:22,854
Go now.

525
00:56:23,029 --> 00:56:24,360
I'll keep you warm and amused

526
00:56:25,031 --> 00:56:28,694
All the things we can do in the rain

527
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:32,461
lt's not working because you messed up
the title of my book.

528
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:34,800
You better be here
when l come back.

529
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:38,569
Okay, l'm exhausted.
l'm gonna wake up now.

530
00:56:38,745 --> 00:56:40,178
Hey.

531
00:56:40,346 --> 00:56:41,938
Stéphanie.

532
00:56:42,115 --> 00:56:45,346
What a coincidence. l almost thought
that l was gonna miss you.

533
00:56:45,518 --> 00:56:46,746
Would you like to marry me?

534
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:50,846
Come. Come with me.
l want to show you my friends.

535
00:56:51,024 --> 00:56:54,721
Hey, guys? Guys,
let me present you to my future wife.

536
00:57:00,433 --> 00:57:04,699
One, l don't believe in marriage,
two, you don't want to be with me.

537
00:57:04,871 --> 00:57:07,772
And three, are you out of your mind?

538
00:57:08,141 --> 00:57:11,167
No, l'm sorry. l'm sorry,
l thought that l was--

539
00:57:11,344 --> 00:57:12,971
You thought what?

540
00:57:13,146 --> 00:57:15,478
l thought that l was here.

541
00:57:15,648 --> 00:57:18,583
And that l was working here,
sleeping in my office.

542
00:57:18,885 --> 00:57:22,844
And then l came here, and then
this part l don't remember very well.

543
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:27,288
There were more people there.
And then l saw you....

544
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:29,758
Where exactly are you living?

545
00:57:32,398 --> 00:57:35,925
l live-- l'm staying
with my mother right now.

546
00:57:36,469 --> 00:57:39,029
So you're my landlord's son?

547
00:57:39,939 --> 00:57:41,463
Yeah.

548
00:57:41,975 --> 00:57:44,307
Are you sure you're okay, Stéphane?

549
00:57:44,477 --> 00:57:45,466
Yeah, why?

550
00:57:46,579 --> 00:57:49,446
So you were not asking me for real then?

551
00:57:49,616 --> 00:57:52,050
No. To marry you, no.

552
00:57:52,819 --> 00:57:54,286
But...

553
00:57:55,822 --> 00:57:58,154
...l think l like you.

554
00:57:59,025 --> 00:58:01,425
You mean in a romantic way?

555
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:05,463
Yeah, if you want to call it like that.

556
00:58:08,168 --> 00:58:10,762
Come on, Stéphane.
l don't want to have a boyfriend.

557
00:58:15,642 --> 00:58:16,734
Okay.

558
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:19,845
So now you'll act all weird around me
because l didn't want to--

559
00:58:20,013 --> 00:58:22,413
No. lt's not my fault, you know,
if l have feelings.

560
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:24,209
You don't have to humiliate me.

561
00:58:24,384 --> 00:58:27,911
Oh, come on, Stéphane.
Stop acting like a child.

562
00:58:31,357 --> 00:58:32,881
Stéphane?

563
00:58:58,918 --> 00:59:01,113
Working is the best remedy then.

564
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:02,845
Keeps your brain busy.

565
00:59:03,022 --> 00:59:06,856
How can you work? Love is too powerful.
You can't concentrate.

566
00:59:10,196 --> 00:59:12,323
Listen. Tell her right away.

567
00:59:12,498 --> 00:59:15,433
lf it's from your heart,
she will understand.

568
00:59:22,575 --> 00:59:24,008
She's with somebody, Stéphane?

569
00:59:32,185 --> 00:59:33,880
What? l don't understand you, Guy.

570
00:59:34,053 --> 00:59:35,884
l'm sorry, l don't understand.

571
00:59:36,055 --> 00:59:37,852
l don't understand you either.

572
00:59:38,024 --> 00:59:41,221
l can't understand you when you
talk to me in two different languages.

573
00:59:41,394 --> 00:59:46,457
lt makes me feel schizometric.
Schizo-- Schizo--

574
00:59:51,471 --> 00:59:54,907
Schizophrenic.
That's the word you're looking for.

575
00:59:55,074 --> 00:59:57,770
-Yeah.
-Hey, don't pay attention to those losers.

576
00:59:57,944 --> 01:00:00,913
Try to be more on time
in the morning. They'll leave you alone.

577
01:00:01,447 --> 01:00:03,438
No, no, no.

578
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:06,178
NPC's for film.

579
01:00:06,352 --> 01:00:09,048
CPN goes with CPP.

580
01:00:19,666 --> 01:00:21,156
CPP.

581
01:00:21,334 --> 01:00:25,532
CPP, NPC, CP-- l get confused.

582
01:00:26,339 --> 01:00:28,432
You know the....

583
01:00:28,608 --> 01:00:30,667
The goat on the cliff?

584
01:00:30,843 --> 01:00:32,970
-The goat on the cliff?
-Goat on the cliff. No?

585
01:00:33,146 --> 01:00:36,240
-lt's a sex position.
-l know it's hard for you to understand...

586
01:00:36,416 --> 01:00:38,680
...but not every man is
a sex maniac, you know.

587
01:00:38,851 --> 01:00:40,079
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

588
01:00:40,253 --> 01:00:42,619
Like every woman is romantic?

589
01:00:42,789 --> 01:00:44,347
l don't know, but....

590
01:00:59,571 --> 01:01:01,664
I am collecting beautiful objects.

591
01:01:03,441 --> 01:01:05,466
A pair of shoes.

592
01:01:08,246 --> 01:01:10,271
Some glasses.

593
01:01:12,517 --> 01:01:14,576
Telephone.

594
01:01:15,654 --> 01:01:17,622
Typewriter.

595
01:01:17,789 --> 01:01:19,552
They are made from wood and felt.

596
01:01:19,724 --> 01:01:21,817
With apparent stitches.

597
01:01:21,993 --> 01:01:25,258
Their delicate and finished
appearance is friendly.

598
01:01:25,430 --> 01:01:27,489
And they are quiet.

599
01:01:27,966 --> 01:01:30,764
Stéphanie made them, and I will
expose them in an exhibition.

600
01:01:30,936 --> 01:01:33,996
Stéphanie, do you think l could
take the red blanket as well?

601
01:01:34,172 --> 01:01:35,935
Of course, Stéphane. Are you kidding?

602
01:01:36,107 --> 01:01:38,200
There's this amazing blanket.

603
01:01:38,376 --> 01:01:42,312
It's thick, red felt
with big white stitches.

604
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:44,471
Wild animals are running on it.

605
01:01:55,293 --> 01:01:57,261
She smiles.

606
01:01:58,029 --> 01:02:01,430
I bend over a rock to try to reach her.

607
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:05,696
My stomach, compressed, hurts.

608
01:02:10,475 --> 01:02:12,409
Stéphanie?

609
01:02:14,779 --> 01:02:16,872
Can you hold my hand?

610
01:02:18,183 --> 01:02:19,980
l cannot sleep.

611
01:02:24,122 --> 01:02:27,091
She takes it. I fall asleep.

612
01:02:48,246 --> 01:02:49,975
The sea.

613
01:02:56,021 --> 01:02:57,989
And the forest.

614
01:03:07,365 --> 01:03:10,027
You should put more whites in.

615
01:03:10,435 --> 01:03:11,663
You should put more whites.

616
01:03:11,836 --> 01:03:13,394
Yeah?

617
01:03:21,613 --> 01:03:24,673
No, a bit--
A bit more to the left, here.

618
01:03:24,849 --> 01:03:29,343
-Oh, yeah.
-Randomness is very difficult to achieve.

619
01:03:29,521 --> 01:03:33,218
Organization always merges back
if you don't pay attention.

620
01:03:33,391 --> 01:03:35,791
Death to organization.

621
01:03:38,163 --> 01:03:40,154
Hey, what's this?

622
01:03:40,765 --> 01:03:42,494
-lt's the....
-ls it your mom's?

623
01:03:42,667 --> 01:03:46,626
No. That's the one-second time travel
machine l told you about.

624
01:03:46,805 --> 01:03:48,966
l finished it. For you.

625
01:03:50,709 --> 01:03:52,301
You wanna try it?

626
01:03:53,311 --> 01:03:55,472
What are you going to do
with one second?

627
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:57,478
Well, it just adds up.

628
01:03:57,649 --> 01:03:59,446
And life is too precious.

629
01:04:00,985 --> 01:04:03,419
So, basically, you put this here.

630
01:04:03,588 --> 01:04:06,216
-Can you hear me?
-Yeah.

631
01:04:07,625 --> 01:04:08,990
Oh, can you-- Okay.

632
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:10,718
So....

633
01:04:11,229 --> 01:04:12,457
Just one second.

634
01:04:13,732 --> 01:04:17,429
This is for the past.
And this is for the future, okay?

635
01:04:17,602 --> 01:04:19,092
So let's try some for the past.

636
01:04:19,270 --> 01:04:21,602
You have to press
this button, okay?

637
01:04:24,209 --> 01:04:26,404
Let's try some for the past.

638
01:04:26,578 --> 01:04:28,045
Let's try some for the past.

639
01:04:28,213 --> 01:04:29,805
Hey, it's working.

640
01:04:29,981 --> 01:04:32,381
Amazing scientific breakthrough.

641
01:04:32,550 --> 01:04:34,984
...scientific breakthrough.

642
01:04:35,153 --> 01:04:38,714
Yeah. No, wait, wait.
Let's save some for the future.

643
01:04:42,026 --> 01:04:43,994
Wait, wait, wait.

644
01:04:46,297 --> 01:04:47,821
Hey, what are you--?

645
01:04:47,999 --> 01:04:49,261
Let me just....

646
01:04:49,434 --> 01:04:51,925
Why did you do it twice?

647
01:04:52,270 --> 01:04:54,568
The first time was the future...

648
01:04:54,739 --> 01:04:57,037
...and the second one
was just the present.

649
01:04:57,208 --> 01:05:00,234
Well, maybe we have different
perspectives on the future.

650
01:05:00,412 --> 01:05:04,178
No, no, no. This is just a machine.
lt's objective. lt's just a machine.

651
01:05:04,349 --> 01:05:06,010
Yeah, okay.

652
01:05:06,184 --> 01:05:09,085
l'm not sure l should accept this gift.

653
01:05:09,254 --> 01:05:11,950
Why do l deserve a present, anyway?

654
01:05:13,324 --> 01:05:16,054
Because for the occasion
that you are pretty.

655
01:05:16,227 --> 01:05:17,717
Oh, shut up.

656
01:05:17,896 --> 01:05:19,454
You're sweet.

657
01:05:21,032 --> 01:05:23,091
So you think l'm only pretty.

658
01:05:23,268 --> 01:05:25,566
Like, l'm pretty and stupid.

659
01:05:25,737 --> 01:05:30,231
-Well, no, maybe you shouldn't have this.
-No, no, no. This is my present.

660
01:05:30,975 --> 01:05:32,442
Okay, let's go back to work.

661
01:05:32,777 --> 01:05:34,802
The ocean's drying.

662
01:05:37,215 --> 01:05:38,512
-What--?
-l'm just seeing....

663
01:05:38,683 --> 01:05:40,173
You have one thing.

664
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:44,151
-Do you have something to say?
-No, no.

665
01:05:44,322 --> 01:05:47,052
Focus and concentration.

666
01:05:47,225 --> 01:05:50,319
Distraction is an obstruction
to the construction.

667
01:05:50,495 --> 01:05:52,895
Distraction is an obstruction
for the construction.

668
01:05:54,365 --> 01:05:56,993
Distraction is an obstruction
for the construction.

669
01:06:20,492 --> 01:06:22,551
-Oh, look.
-What?

670
01:06:22,727 --> 01:06:24,160
Skiers.

671
01:06:28,066 --> 01:06:29,931
Oh, look, look!

672
01:06:32,337 --> 01:06:33,326
A lake what?

673
01:06:36,508 --> 01:06:40,239
-Weird. That's really weird.
-Stéphane, talk with your heart.

674
01:06:40,411 --> 01:06:44,472
-Yeah, be gentle.
-Fuck her.

675
01:06:44,649 --> 01:06:46,844
No, no. Don't rush.

676
01:06:47,018 --> 01:06:50,454
-The goat on the cliff, remember?
-What?

677
01:06:51,556 --> 01:06:53,183
What's the goat on the cliff?

678
01:06:53,358 --> 01:06:55,258
lt's a little children's story.

679
01:06:55,426 --> 01:06:58,020
lt's, it's silly, don't listen to that.

680
01:06:58,196 --> 01:06:59,754
Don't listen. Don't listen.

681
01:07:08,039 --> 01:07:10,530
-On the cliff.
-The goat on the cliff!

682
01:07:10,708 --> 01:07:12,801
Martine, the goat on the cliff.

683
01:07:12,977 --> 01:07:14,467
Serge.

684
01:07:43,074 --> 01:07:44,564
-l'll go first.
-No.

685
01:07:44,742 --> 01:07:46,607
-l don't know how to ski.
-Come on.

686
01:07:46,778 --> 01:07:49,406
-l don't wanna go.
-lt's easy. Courage, pretty boy.

687
01:09:22,940 --> 01:09:24,737
Wait, wait, wait.
lt's not gonna hurt.

688
01:09:24,909 --> 01:09:26,604
lt's not gonna hurt.

689
01:09:34,919 --> 01:09:36,318
Okay.

690
01:09:37,622 --> 01:09:39,749
Okay, good.

691
01:09:42,026 --> 01:09:45,587
-Good.
-Hey, you take the glue gun, and l'll try this.

692
01:09:45,763 --> 01:09:46,991
No, no, no.

693
01:09:47,165 --> 01:09:49,065
Why don't we,
why don't we do the scene...

694
01:09:49,233 --> 01:09:51,599
...when you walk
into the apartment...

695
01:09:51,769 --> 01:09:53,760
...and you discover the pony, yeah?

696
01:09:53,938 --> 01:09:55,166
-Yeah. Okay.
-Yeah?

697
01:09:55,339 --> 01:09:57,864
Okay. So come, come, come.

698
01:09:58,042 --> 01:10:01,102
You must be.... Okay. Yeah, there.

699
01:10:01,846 --> 01:10:04,314
-Oh, wait.
-All right, okay, you're there.

700
01:10:04,482 --> 01:10:07,508
So basically you're just
walking into the apartment...

701
01:10:07,685 --> 01:10:09,983
...and you discover
that the pony can run...

702
01:10:10,154 --> 01:10:13,351
...and you feel very excited, and....

703
01:10:13,524 --> 01:10:16,493
Ready? And action.

704
01:10:16,694 --> 01:10:19,060
Damn it, Stéphane,
you've ruined my pony.

705
01:10:19,230 --> 01:10:22,927
-Why did you do that?
-Cut. What are you doing?

706
01:10:23,101 --> 01:10:24,932
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

707
01:10:25,103 --> 01:10:27,003
No, you should be ecstatic about me.

708
01:10:27,171 --> 01:10:30,800
You should be, like,
praising my ingénue and genius.

709
01:10:30,975 --> 01:10:33,341
Of course, my handsome.

710
01:10:33,644 --> 01:10:36,442
No, don't play with me.
This is never gonna happen.

711
01:10:36,614 --> 01:10:38,582
-How do you know?
-Because l know.

712
01:10:38,750 --> 01:10:40,650
Why are you trying
to give me hope?

713
01:10:40,818 --> 01:10:43,719
Hope? Maybe you should try.

714
01:10:43,888 --> 01:10:45,253
Try.

715
01:10:45,423 --> 01:10:48,119
Well, next time l'll see you,
l'll kiss you?

716
01:10:48,292 --> 01:10:50,385
-ls that what you're asking me?
-Yeah.

717
01:10:50,561 --> 01:10:52,290
-Really?
-Yeah, you should try.

718
01:10:52,463 --> 01:10:54,658
l should just
go out there and kiss you.

719
01:10:54,832 --> 01:10:56,163
Yeah.

720
01:10:57,468 --> 01:10:59,095
Okay.

721
01:10:59,370 --> 01:11:00,701
-Yeah.
-Go on.

722
01:11:14,152 --> 01:11:15,983
What are you doing?

723
01:11:16,154 --> 01:11:18,554
l'm sorry. l'm sorry. l'm sorry.

724
01:11:18,723 --> 01:11:21,283
Can you pretend that l,
that you didn't see me?

725
01:11:21,459 --> 01:11:23,893
-l was just leaving, right now.
-This is stupid.

726
01:11:24,061 --> 01:11:26,029
-You broke into my place?
-l'm sorry.

727
01:11:26,197 --> 01:11:28,358
-What are you looking for?
-l'm sorry.

728
01:11:28,533 --> 01:11:30,899
That's creepy. No, this way.

729
01:11:31,903 --> 01:11:34,963
-Good night.
-Oh, l forgot my keys.

730
01:11:52,657 --> 01:11:55,285
-Hello?
-Stéphane?

731
01:11:55,793 --> 01:11:57,784
Are you okay?

732
01:11:58,362 --> 01:12:00,353
I love my pony.

733
01:12:00,531 --> 01:12:02,362
I can't believe you did that.

734
01:12:02,967 --> 01:12:05,026
How did you do it?

735
01:12:08,039 --> 01:12:10,599
l'm sorry about what l said.

736
01:12:10,775 --> 01:12:12,072
l didn't mean one word.

737
01:12:12,243 --> 01:12:14,006
-No....
-Okay?

738
01:12:14,178 --> 01:12:15,509
No, l'm a creep.

739
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:17,272
Just like you said.

740
01:12:17,448 --> 01:12:21,316
Listen, Stéphane.
You have to toughen up a little.

741
01:12:21,886 --> 01:12:25,378
lt's not attractive for a girl
to see a guy crying.

742
01:12:25,556 --> 01:12:27,251
I know, it sucks.

743
01:12:28,459 --> 01:12:31,986
You know I named
Golden the Pony Boy after you.

744
01:12:32,163 --> 01:12:34,791
No, come on. Come on.

745
01:12:34,966 --> 01:12:38,094
lt's not true. You had him
before we met.

746
01:12:38,269 --> 01:12:39,759
No, no, it is true.

747
01:12:39,937 --> 01:12:43,873
l improvised his name when
you saw him for the first time.

748
01:12:44,041 --> 01:12:46,202
He didn't have a name.

749
01:12:46,377 --> 01:12:48,470
Now, tell me how you did it.

750
01:12:48,646 --> 01:12:50,204
Golden is galloping for real.

751
01:12:50,381 --> 01:12:53,407
It's unreal.

752
01:12:54,552 --> 01:12:55,814
Well....

753
01:12:56,520 --> 01:13:01,219
lt's just an application
of the chaos theory.

754
01:13:02,059 --> 01:13:03,390
Random control.

755
01:13:03,561 --> 01:13:04,858
Each leg has one engine...

756
01:13:05,029 --> 01:13:07,429
...and it moves backwards
or forwards depending on...

757
01:13:07,598 --> 01:13:11,694
...the movement on the other leg.
lt's like life.

758
01:13:12,169 --> 01:13:15,002
But in a simplified version.

759
01:13:15,940 --> 01:13:18,272
And it doesn't reproduce.

760
01:13:20,912 --> 01:13:23,938
l'm glad we live
next door to each other.

761
01:13:26,317 --> 01:13:27,978
Will you....

762
01:13:28,653 --> 01:13:32,111
Would you marry me when we're 70?

763
01:13:32,290 --> 01:13:35,088
You've got nothing to lose.

764
01:13:39,263 --> 01:13:40,855
Okay.

765
01:13:41,032 --> 01:13:43,000
Would you mind...

766
01:13:43,868 --> 01:13:46,928
...keep on talking to me
for a little while?

767
01:13:47,638 --> 01:13:51,335
Because l always thought
it was possible to talk from my sleep.

768
01:13:51,509 --> 01:13:54,501
l feel that l'm falling down
into a black hole.

769
01:13:55,313 --> 01:13:58,874
You know that you could never see
someone fall in a black hole.

770
01:13:59,050 --> 01:14:02,213
Because the image of the traveler
who passes the horizon...

771
01:14:02,386 --> 01:14:07,050
...would slow down till it would remain
stuck in the same position...

772
01:14:07,224 --> 01:14:09,624
The state he was
when he crossed the line.

773
01:14:09,794 --> 01:14:12,160
Only it's getting redder.

774
01:14:12,330 --> 01:14:16,357
The traveler gets crushed into spaghetti.

775
01:14:16,801 --> 01:14:19,998
I don't wanna be a spaghetti,
I don't wanna be spaghetti.

776
01:14:20,171 --> 01:14:21,729
No, you won't be a spaghetti.

777
01:14:21,906 --> 01:14:23,271
I don't wanna be a spaghetti.

778
01:14:23,441 --> 01:14:25,705
Stéphane?

779
01:14:26,844 --> 01:14:30,280
-Are you here?
-No, I'm there! I'm there.

780
01:14:30,448 --> 01:14:33,474
It worked! I'm not a spaghetti!

781
01:14:33,651 --> 01:14:36,779
Tell me, tell me. Describe all you can see.

782
01:14:36,954 --> 01:14:38,854
I feel some grass under my feet.

783
01:14:39,023 --> 01:14:40,854
And it's a bit windy.

784
01:14:41,025 --> 01:14:44,358
And cold. And damp.

785
01:14:44,528 --> 01:14:47,395
And there's forest all around me.

786
01:14:48,299 --> 01:14:51,928
And l can see Golden the Pony Boy.
Galloping here. Here, right in front of me.

787
01:14:52,103 --> 01:14:55,869
And I can hear some water.
But I cannot see it.

788
01:14:57,375 --> 01:14:59,400
Oh, here it is. The river.

789
01:14:59,577 --> 01:15:03,206
ls the water made of millions
of tiny pieces of cellophane?

790
01:15:03,381 --> 01:15:05,474
No, it's real water.

791
01:15:05,649 --> 01:15:08,311
Oh, look. l just found the time machine.

792
01:15:08,486 --> 01:15:10,511
The time machine is here.

793
01:15:16,694 --> 01:15:18,787
And it works.

794
01:15:24,135 --> 01:15:27,400
Stéphane, are you asleep?

795
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:30,905
Stéphanie, you know my mom, Christine.

796
01:15:31,075 --> 01:15:32,372
two months later

797
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:38,640
Yeah, l cannot talk French
because whenever l speak...

798
01:15:38,816 --> 01:15:42,308
...l feel that my moustache grows
more than when l speak Spanish.

799
01:15:42,486 --> 01:15:44,351
Stéphanie.

800
01:16:51,755 --> 01:16:53,245
l....

801
01:16:55,359 --> 01:16:58,328
l wanna dedicate this
to all the victims....

802
01:16:58,496 --> 01:17:00,555
Okay, thank you, Mr. Miroux.

803
01:17:00,731 --> 01:17:05,828
Without them, without them,
it would not have been possible.

804
01:17:52,449 --> 01:17:54,781
l'm sorry. Are you upset?

805
01:18:26,684 --> 01:18:30,120
This girl is at once all the women
that broke my heart.

806
01:18:30,287 --> 01:18:34,451
She's so beautiful and generous
and she's asking me to leave.

807
01:18:34,625 --> 01:18:36,650
Because she's dumping me.

808
01:18:36,827 --> 01:18:40,422
She's dumping me because
I am a cheap drug dealer.

809
01:18:40,598 --> 01:18:43,590
And I am a drug dealer
because she wants to leave me.

810
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:46,965
The police are going to get me now.

811
01:18:47,137 --> 01:18:48,968
This is all my fault.

812
01:19:48,699 --> 01:19:50,929
He is my opposite.

813
01:19:51,268 --> 01:19:53,463
She feels safe around him.

814
01:19:54,805 --> 01:19:56,864
She's in love with him.

815
01:20:24,702 --> 01:20:27,899
Things will turn out the way you want.

816
01:20:28,972 --> 01:20:32,135
lf you could just stop doubting
that l love you.

817
01:20:33,010 --> 01:20:36,104
Call me home. Next door.

818
01:21:59,329 --> 01:22:00,796
lt's not fair.

819
01:22:00,964 --> 01:22:04,092
She changed exactly the second
l started to like her.

820
01:22:04,268 --> 01:22:07,135
lt's like a big bang.
The first instant, it's very small...

821
01:22:07,304 --> 01:22:10,034
...and then the next nano instant:

822
01:22:10,207 --> 01:22:13,142
Huge. lnfinite.

823
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:17,511
l wish l could travel back to the time
when l didn't find her attractive.

824
01:22:17,681 --> 01:22:20,514
You should have asked me.
She has a really good ass.

825
01:22:20,684 --> 01:22:24,518
Shut up, Guy. l thought she was lonely,
and somehow l could help her.

826
01:22:24,688 --> 01:22:27,680
But no. She doesn't need me at all.

827
01:22:27,858 --> 01:22:29,758
You know, l don't know
Stéphanie and all.

828
01:22:29,927 --> 01:22:32,487
But maybe she has a pattern.

829
01:22:32,663 --> 01:22:36,030
She doesn't wanna get hurt,
and by that she's hurting people.

830
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:39,966
And by hurting people, she thinks
she's not gonna get hurt, but she gets hurt.

831
01:22:40,137 --> 01:22:44,369
l don't know. l love her
because she makes things.

832
01:22:44,541 --> 01:22:47,635
You know? She makes things
with her hands.

833
01:22:47,811 --> 01:22:52,248
lt's as if her synapses
was married directly to her fingers.

834
01:22:53,016 --> 01:22:55,814
Like this. ln this way.

835
01:22:55,986 --> 01:22:57,954
Yeah, yeah.

836
01:22:59,590 --> 01:23:02,525
Man, l wish l could talk to my dad.

837
01:23:04,328 --> 01:23:08,059
l miss my father. l cannot talk
with my mom when l'm sad.

838
01:23:32,422 --> 01:23:36,188
You know, you can't let things
bother you all your life.

839
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:38,123
A man has to take matters
in his hands.

840
01:23:38,295 --> 01:23:41,731
This TV is brainwashing my weekends.

841
01:23:41,899 --> 01:23:45,300
l should be....
lnstead, l'm just watching this.

842
01:23:54,545 --> 01:23:57,241
l'm sorry, l wasn't sure l was awake.

843
01:23:57,414 --> 01:24:01,646
Awake? l will awake you for sure
if you carry on like this.

844
01:24:01,818 --> 01:24:05,584
Here, help me,
instead of being stupid aleck.

845
01:24:27,277 --> 01:24:28,266
lt floats, yeah.

846
01:24:45,128 --> 01:24:46,789
Stéphane?

847
01:24:49,166 --> 01:24:51,361
Stéphane. Wait.

848
01:24:52,069 --> 01:24:53,297
Do you feel better?

849
01:24:54,037 --> 01:24:55,629
l'm going to work.

850
01:24:56,607 --> 01:24:58,370
l just want to know if you're okay.

851
01:24:58,542 --> 01:25:01,010
Yeah, l'm super-fine. Thanks.

852
01:25:01,712 --> 01:25:04,613
So l get it. So you don't want
to be my friend anymore.

853
01:25:04,781 --> 01:25:08,547
No, l don't wanna be your friend anymore.
l don't wanna be your friend anymore.

854
01:25:08,719 --> 01:25:12,120
Do l have to nail it on your door?
l don't wanna be your friend.

855
01:25:12,589 --> 01:25:16,389
No, you-- You can't.
You can't stop being my friend.

856
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:19,188
-lt's not something people can decide.
-Yeah, they can.

857
01:25:19,363 --> 01:25:22,332
People have an argument and then
they stop talking to each other.

858
01:25:22,499 --> 01:25:25,957
Okay, then let's have a date or something
and we can talk about things.

859
01:25:26,136 --> 01:25:28,127
-lf that's what you want.
-What's the point?

860
01:25:28,305 --> 01:25:32,537
You'll want me as a friend. You'll have
a nice boyfriend and that'll kill me.

861
01:25:32,709 --> 01:25:34,700
By the way, where's the boat?

862
01:25:34,878 --> 01:25:38,041
Where's everything? Let's face it.
You never finished anything.

863
01:25:38,215 --> 01:25:40,080
Like the mezzanine and everything else?

864
01:25:40,250 --> 01:25:43,777
That's not true.
That's absolutely not true.

865
01:25:43,954 --> 01:25:45,216
l'll show you.

866
01:25:45,389 --> 01:25:49,689
You're manipulating me or....
l don't, l don't understand.

867
01:25:50,927 --> 01:25:52,895
Look, here it is.

868
01:25:54,197 --> 01:25:56,927
Here, here it is. Zoé's number.

869
01:25:57,100 --> 01:25:59,034
That's what you want.

870
01:26:00,303 --> 01:26:04,069
Screw her.
''l'm only your neighbor and a liar.

871
01:26:04,241 --> 01:26:08,177
''By the way, do you have Zoé's number?''
Do you remember the letter that night?

872
01:26:08,345 --> 01:26:10,279
How did you get that?

873
01:26:10,447 --> 01:26:13,644
Wait, wait. Wait, l'm sorry.

874
01:26:18,922 --> 01:26:21,152
No, no, no. Stop crying.

875
01:26:21,324 --> 01:26:22,882
Stop crying.

876
01:26:28,632 --> 01:26:30,122
l'm sorry.

877
01:26:32,669 --> 01:26:34,261
l'm sorry.

878
01:26:36,406 --> 01:26:38,306
-Guy, Guy.
-Hey.

879
01:26:38,709 --> 01:26:40,700
Did you see the red on?
l'm doing your work.

880
01:26:40,877 --> 01:26:42,367
l'm sorry. l'm sorry.

881
01:26:42,546 --> 01:26:44,878
Something amazing happened
between Stéphanie and l.

882
01:26:45,048 --> 01:26:46,675
-Come on, shut up, now.
-lncredible!

883
01:26:46,850 --> 01:26:49,512
Stop bullshitting. l'm sick
of breaking my balls with you.

884
01:26:49,686 --> 01:26:51,711
-l'm doing your work. Know why?
-Why?

885
01:26:51,888 --> 01:26:54,220
Because you're virtually fired,
my sleepy man.

886
01:26:54,391 --> 01:26:56,359
And mother or not mother
to cover your ass.

887
01:27:03,767 --> 01:27:05,894
Okay, you don't know
what happens between us.

888
01:27:06,069 --> 01:27:07,593
Nobody has a clue what happens...

889
01:27:07,771 --> 01:27:09,739
...and everybody has an opinion.
Fuck that.

890
01:27:09,906 --> 01:27:14,707
l wrote her a letter in my dream
and l never gave it to her.

891
01:27:14,878 --> 01:27:18,370
And she read it. l don't know how,
but she somehow read it.

892
01:27:18,548 --> 01:27:20,778
And she just recited it to me just now.

893
01:27:20,951 --> 01:27:22,282
Word by word. She knows it.

894
01:27:22,452 --> 01:27:24,943
And you know why?
Because l think our brains...

895
01:27:25,122 --> 01:27:27,556
...are creating this loop
that is incredibly complex.

896
01:27:27,724 --> 01:27:31,319
lt's not as if our brains are communicating
or telepathy or nothing like that.

897
01:27:31,495 --> 01:27:34,487
lt's as if we were evolving
each step into the same direction.

898
01:27:34,664 --> 01:27:37,030
lt's called PSR.
Parallel synchronized randomness.

899
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:40,260
lt's incredibly rare. lt's as if
we were jigsaw puzzles, you know?

900
01:27:40,437 --> 01:27:45,340
-And we're falling to, into the....
-Stéphane, you will never date her, okay?

901
01:27:45,509 --> 01:27:49,809
-She will drive you crazy, believe me.
-No, she just asked me for a date.

902
01:27:49,980 --> 01:27:52,380
ln 20 minutes at the Bar de l'Oreille.
l have to go.

903
01:27:52,549 --> 01:27:55,109
Minutes at the Bar de l'Oreille.
l have to go.

904
01:27:56,620 --> 01:27:58,451
lt's my travel, time travel machine.

905
01:28:00,056 --> 01:28:02,991
You just walk in, Pouchet didn't
see you, so you won't go.

906
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:06,789
Oh, come on. Guy, Guy, come on!
lt's just once. Okay, just this time.

907
01:28:53,777 --> 01:28:55,745
You will never date her, okay?

908
01:28:55,912 --> 01:28:58,642
-She will drive you crazy.
-Drive me crazy.

909
01:28:58,815 --> 01:29:02,114
I refuse to believe only friendship
from Stéphanie.

910
01:29:02,285 --> 01:29:04,185
There are signs that can't be mistaken.

911
01:29:04,354 --> 01:29:07,721
Can't be mistaken. Look, look.

912
01:29:08,058 --> 01:29:11,585
She kisses me at less than
a centimeter of my lips.

913
01:29:12,195 --> 01:29:16,188
It is a sign, the most evident,
that she desires me.

914
01:29:16,366 --> 01:29:19,301
Where should she kiss to her friendly
goodbye? On the forehead?

915
01:29:19,469 --> 01:29:24,406
No, halfway between the ear and the lips.
That's what's considered normal.

916
01:29:24,574 --> 01:29:27,907
Besides, if I don't move my head back,
she hits me right on the lips.

917
01:29:28,078 --> 01:29:30,069
Why did you move away
from her kiss, then?

918
01:29:30,247 --> 01:29:32,909
Maybe I tried to kiss her, who cares?

919
01:29:33,083 --> 01:29:37,713
The point is that she will torture,
torture, torture me all my life.

920
01:29:37,888 --> 01:29:39,412
She simply doesn't care about me.

921
01:29:39,589 --> 01:29:42,683
No, this is not true. She cares a lot.
She worships my presence.

922
01:29:42,859 --> 01:29:46,556
She feels sorry for me.
Pity. That's the worst.

923
01:29:46,730 --> 01:29:49,528
Exactly. My feeling has reached
the point of pathology...

924
01:29:49,699 --> 01:29:52,691
...and I can't seduce anyone
without pathology.

925
01:29:57,140 --> 01:30:00,803
You believe you can seduce her with
your creepy, pathological little gifts?

926
01:30:00,977 --> 01:30:04,469
They all ended up in the trash,
blinded by your....

927
01:30:05,148 --> 01:30:07,207
-No.
-Nobody is waiting for you at the bar.

928
01:30:07,384 --> 01:30:10,114
Stéphanie never came.
She lost interest in you long ago.

929
01:30:11,187 --> 01:30:13,587
-lt's too late. Stéphanie moved on.
-No.

930
01:30:13,757 --> 01:30:16,021
-Stéphanie moved on. Moved on.
-Go away.

931
01:30:16,192 --> 01:30:17,420
Will never change her mind.

932
01:30:18,094 --> 01:30:20,255
Girls never change their mind
when it's over.

933
01:30:27,170 --> 01:30:29,764
Open the door. l know you are there.

934
01:30:30,240 --> 01:30:32,208
Open the door.

935
01:30:32,375 --> 01:30:35,367
You forgot about me.

936
01:30:37,747 --> 01:30:40,511
Stop playing with me.

937
01:30:44,921 --> 01:30:48,015
l never want to see you again.

938
01:31:59,729 --> 01:32:01,788
Say it.

939
01:32:01,965 --> 01:32:04,763
Say it, you have to say it.

940
01:32:04,934 --> 01:32:08,062
-Listen to me. Listen to me, say it.
-Camera there.

941
01:32:08,238 --> 01:32:10,604
-Say it.
-Okay, it's all in order. Okay.

942
01:32:11,641 --> 01:32:15,907
-lt won't happen. You have to say it.
-Yeah, just wait a second, wait a second.

943
01:32:16,079 --> 01:32:18,547
-Go on, say it.
-Okay. Perfect. Yeah.

944
01:32:18,715 --> 01:32:22,207
Just-- Okay. Right there.
Okay, now look at the camera.

945
01:32:22,385 --> 01:32:24,615
-Will you marry me?
-Yes.

946
01:33:23,613 --> 01:33:25,080
l've changed my mind.

947
01:33:58,014 --> 01:33:59,413
-Hey, Stéphane.
-Hey.

948
01:33:59,582 --> 01:34:01,413
What's going on?

949
01:34:01,885 --> 01:34:04,820
Nothing's going on. l'm just leaving.

950
01:34:04,988 --> 01:34:07,081
Yeah, l know.

951
01:34:08,525 --> 01:34:10,720
Are you still upset with me?

952
01:34:11,461 --> 01:34:14,988
Well, let's just say that
there are some unsolved issues.

953
01:34:15,165 --> 01:34:16,393
Yeah.

954
01:34:17,233 --> 01:34:18,666
You're not gonna let me in?

955
01:34:19,602 --> 01:34:22,435
lnstall a toilet paper dispenser
because people are wiping...

956
01:34:22,605 --> 01:34:24,505
...their dirty Sanchez here
on your door.

957
01:34:24,674 --> 01:34:25,971
Oh, shut up.

958
01:34:27,610 --> 01:34:29,475
How is your head?

959
01:34:29,646 --> 01:34:31,273
lt's okay.

960
01:34:31,748 --> 01:34:33,443
lt's not normal, though.

961
01:34:33,616 --> 01:34:35,550
Oh, well, of course it's not.

962
01:34:35,718 --> 01:34:39,882
-lt's never going to be.
-Yeah, well, it is not attractive to you.

963
01:34:40,790 --> 01:34:43,156
l'm glad l made it
through your door, though.

964
01:34:43,326 --> 01:34:44,691
Don't be glad.

965
01:34:44,861 --> 01:34:46,089
Be sad.

966
01:34:48,164 --> 01:34:50,064
Your English is very good.

967
01:34:50,233 --> 01:34:51,530
What about your French?

968
01:34:51,701 --> 01:34:55,034
No, l can't speak French with you.
l'm too shy.

969
01:34:55,205 --> 01:34:57,264
The only thing l can say is:

970
01:35:02,145 --> 01:35:04,113
Oh, damn it, Stéphane.

971
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:06,305
What if someone catches fire?

972
01:35:09,819 --> 01:35:11,946
We've got to help him. Quick.

973
01:35:21,631 --> 01:35:23,895
Go, go, go!

974
01:35:33,443 --> 01:35:36,173
Anarchy in the cellophane!

975
01:35:41,618 --> 01:35:43,779
You've been crying?

976
01:35:43,953 --> 01:35:47,480
l like it when you cry
because you have to wear your glasses.

977
01:35:50,159 --> 01:35:52,753
l actually don't like it when you cry.

978
01:35:53,229 --> 01:35:55,254
l find it horrible.

979
01:35:55,698 --> 01:35:58,132
Especially when it's not for me.

980
01:35:58,501 --> 01:36:00,435
Will you cry a little when l'm dead?

981
01:36:00,770 --> 01:36:04,536
l hate people that pretend that they want
everyone to celebrate their death...

982
01:36:04,707 --> 01:36:08,108
...you know, and everyone is having
a blast at the party...

983
01:36:08,278 --> 01:36:10,576
...and nobody gives a shit
for the dead.

984
01:36:10,747 --> 01:36:12,908
That's horrible. That's bullshit.

985
01:36:13,082 --> 01:36:17,746
lt's like, ''Hey, sleep with my girlfriend
after my cremation. Do you mind?''

986
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:21,117
You know? Well, my problem is that
l don't have a girlfriend.

987
01:36:21,291 --> 01:36:23,259
And l'm not dead.

988
01:36:28,731 --> 01:36:31,393
Look. Put your finger here.

989
01:36:31,567 --> 01:36:33,057
Touch here.

990
01:36:33,236 --> 01:36:35,830
At the back of the ear and the glasses.

991
01:36:36,005 --> 01:36:40,032
lt feels like the glasses were
part of your body.

992
01:36:40,243 --> 01:36:43,007
Oh, true. That's weird.

993
01:36:43,179 --> 01:36:46,148
-l always liked that.
-My contacts are killing me.

994
01:36:47,183 --> 01:36:51,449
lt's like if you were touching
your penis with your left hand.

995
01:36:51,821 --> 01:36:53,550
l don't have a penis.

996
01:36:53,723 --> 01:36:55,156
You have a left hand.

997
01:36:56,926 --> 01:37:00,020
Why do you always have to be a pig?

998
01:37:02,899 --> 01:37:05,390
l'm teasing you.

999
01:37:08,504 --> 01:37:11,098
Will you fix your teeth one day?

1000
01:37:13,509 --> 01:37:17,707
-You're mean.
-No, l'm just saying because--

1001
01:37:17,980 --> 01:37:20,073
l mean, it's gonna be 40 years
until we marry.

1002
01:37:20,249 --> 01:37:23,582
And l might as well take care
of my goods now, you know?

1003
01:37:23,753 --> 01:37:25,584
Well, actually, you know?

1004
01:37:25,755 --> 01:37:27,017
Don't do anything.

1005
01:37:27,190 --> 01:37:30,159
Maybe no teeth is good
for a blow job.

1006
01:37:31,594 --> 01:37:34,757
Okay. l think you should leave now.

1007
01:37:35,631 --> 01:37:36,859
You gonna be late.

1008
01:37:37,033 --> 01:37:39,729
You know, sometimes l wear my jeans
for more than a week...

1009
01:37:39,902 --> 01:37:43,633
...until they're really bad. And it
makes me feel a little bit closer to you.

1010
01:37:44,006 --> 01:37:47,442
-What do you want me to say to that?
-Nothing. Nothing.

1011
01:37:47,610 --> 01:37:49,202
So how is your boyfriend?

1012
01:37:49,379 --> 01:37:51,438
You have a new boyfriend?

1013
01:37:51,981 --> 01:37:53,539
A new boyfriend with long hair...

1014
01:37:53,716 --> 01:37:56,082
...and goes bungee jumping and surfing.

1015
01:37:56,252 --> 01:37:57,742
Does he take you surfing?

1016
01:37:57,920 --> 01:38:00,582
lnvite me, l'll go with you.
l don't know how but maybe--

1017
01:38:00,757 --> 01:38:02,952
l mean, if you want me to.

1018
01:38:03,126 --> 01:38:05,117
l don't have a boyfriend.

1019
01:38:05,294 --> 01:38:08,127
And you have a serious problem
of distorting reality.

1020
01:38:08,297 --> 01:38:12,631
You could sleep with the entire planet
and still feel rejected.

1021
01:38:12,802 --> 01:38:16,067
-Please, l'd like you to go now.
-l like your boobs.

1022
01:38:16,439 --> 01:38:19,272
l like your boobs. They are very friendly
and unpretentious.

1023
01:38:19,442 --> 01:38:21,842
l'll appreciate if, one day,
you'll show them to me?

1024
01:38:22,011 --> 01:38:24,377
-Not much to see. Now, go.
-Hey, the mezzanine.

1025
01:38:24,580 --> 01:38:26,241
You finished the mezzanine.

1026
01:38:26,416 --> 01:38:28,577
l thought you were never gonna finish it.

1027
01:38:28,751 --> 01:38:31,345
Like the boat and everything else.

1028
01:38:31,721 --> 01:38:33,348
ls it solid?

1029
01:38:34,223 --> 01:38:37,283
Can it hold a boy? A couple?

1030
01:38:37,727 --> 01:38:39,752
What are you doing--? Get out.

1031
01:38:39,929 --> 01:38:41,453
-Get out of here.
-No.

1032
01:38:41,631 --> 01:38:44,327
-Get out or l'll call your mother.
-No, my mother? No. No.

1033
01:38:44,534 --> 01:38:46,126
Not my mother.

1034
01:38:46,569 --> 01:38:50,198
-You're gonna miss your plane.
-l don't care. l don't care.

1035
01:38:50,773 --> 01:38:53,105
Why do you do this to me?

1036
01:38:53,276 --> 01:38:54,766
What have l done to you?

1037
01:38:54,944 --> 01:38:57,469
Tell me what do you want me to do?

1038
01:38:59,282 --> 01:39:01,011
l don't know.

1039
01:39:01,918 --> 01:39:03,681
Maybe touch my hair or something?

1040
01:39:03,853 --> 01:39:06,083
l can't do that.

1041
01:39:07,857 --> 01:39:09,620
Why me?

1042
01:39:09,792 --> 01:39:12,260
Because everyone else is boring.

1043
01:39:12,428 --> 01:39:14,089
And because you're different.

1044
01:39:16,098 --> 01:39:18,726
You don't like me, Stéphanie.

1045
01:40:21,931 --> 01:40:23,796
Stéphane?

1046
01:46:24,026 --> 01:46:26,017
