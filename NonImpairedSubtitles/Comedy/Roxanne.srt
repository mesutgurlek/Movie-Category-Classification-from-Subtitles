1
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,230
<i>I am walking, yes indeed,</i>
<i>and I am talking about you and me -</i>

2
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,995
<i>- and I am hoping you bop-be-da-deh.</i>

3
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,279
<i>I am forming words with my tongue</i>
<i>I am stumbling, but I am okay now.</i>

4
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,868
<i>Now, I am walking down the steps,</i>
<i>it is easier than walking up the steps.</i>

5
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:07,836
<i>Did not slide.</i>
<i>That is a tough break for me.</i>

6
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:14,153
<i>Now, I am having a small heart attack,</i>
<i>but I am recovering.</i>

7
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,949
<i>Now I am seeing</i>
<i>two coked-out hopheads coming at me -</i>

8
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,315
<i>- could be trouble.</i>

9
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,995
- Get off the sidewalk!
- Other side of the street, scum.

10
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,720
It is a cop!

11
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,872
If he is a cop, where is his gun?

12
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,076
He is a fireman.

13
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,478
Cut a wide swath, pussy.

14
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,792
- All right.
- Thank you, arse-wipe.

15
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,235
Christ, that is the biggest nose...

16
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,278
Do not say it...

17
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,275
Quite a hood ornament you have there.

18
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,514
Here it comes...
Three-D coming at you!

19
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,999
- I really admire your shoes.
- What?

20
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,550
- I love your shoes.
- What?

21
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,278
I was just thinking -

22
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:17,992
- as much as I admire them and would
love to have a pair just like them -

23
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,950
- I would not want
to be <i>in</i> your shoes right now.

24
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,075
- I do not really know karate.
- I did not think so.

25
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,390
- Get pissed, Rich.
- I am pissed.

26
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,036
Fifteen - Love.

27
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,035
You want trouble? You will get it.

28
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,110
Oh, fault.

29
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,795
If that is how you want to play...

30
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,951
You broke my nose!

31
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,510
- Had enough yet?
- Thirty - Love.

32
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,356
Surprise! ...Forty - Love.

33
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,837
Are we having fun yet?

34
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,798
Service.

35
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,391
Game.

36
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,235
Let us play again sometime.

37
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,030
Grover?

38
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,190
Dixie?

39
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,195
Where the hell is she?
Here is your racket.

40
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,352
Thank you.
What is this stuff on it?

41
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,956
Blood. Where is my tea?

42
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:43,074
- Will you tell me about it?
- You are too young.

43
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,391
Come here, Grover.

44
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,796
Damn it.

45
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,669
There had better be a window open,
Grover.

46
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,717
I will have you neutered.

47
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,870
Do not go anywhere.
I will go to the front.

48
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,436
Oh, no!

49
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,555
I cannot believe it.

50
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,515
Goddamn it,
we are supposed to put them out!

51
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,558
- Guys, guys!
- What now?

52
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,229
I have a dream, just a little dream.

53
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,836
My dream,
I hope you do not find it crazy -

54
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,549
- is that I would like
the people here to feel -

55
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:17,114
- that if there were a fire, calling the
fire department would be a wise idea.

56
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,590
You cannot have people
with burning houses saying:

57
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,672
"Whatever you do,
do not call the fire department."

58
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,149
That would be bad.

59
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:33,395
Please, get it cleaned up.
Do not make me have to explain it.

60
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,194
Hello...

61
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,869
Hello?

62
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,994
I am locked out of my house.

63
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,152
I can get you in. I will get my tools.

64
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,754
I do not have any clothes on.

65
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,230
Do you want a coat or something?

66
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,837
No, I would like to stand naked
in this bush in the freezing cold.

67
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,993
- I will get the tools.
- Thank you.

68
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,319
- What is it?
- Somebody locked out of their house.

69
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:15,553
- Do you need any help?
- No, it looks boring. I will go.

70
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,834
- Nobody had a coat?
- You said you did not want one.

71
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,753
- Why would I not want a coat?
- You said so!

72
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,755
- I was being ironic.
- Oh, irony. We do not get that here.

73
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:33,755
People ski topless here while smoking
dope, so irony is not a high priority.

74
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:38,391
We have not had irony here since '83,
when I was the only practitioner of it, -

75
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,711
- and I stopped as
I was tired of being stared at.

76
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,838
You should turn off the lights
when you are locked out -

77
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,831
- you waste electricity.

78
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,436
You can hide your nakedness
in that bush.

79
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,388
I notice you do not have any tattoos.
Wise choice.

80
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,031
Jackie Onassis would not have gone
so far with an anchor on her arm.

81
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,078
Every job has a perfect tool.

82
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,875
This lock does not accept Master Charge.
We will try the old reliable.

83
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,156
And when I say -

84
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,757
- "old reliable", I am lying,
because I never tried this before.

85
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,718
You may not want to watch this.

86
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,839
Be careful.

87
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,473
God, I hate heights.

88
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,716
- What are you doing? I am freezing!
- For God's sake, put something on!

89
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,792
Thank you.

90
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,593
Here you go.
I am averting my eyes, finally.

91
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,835
Look what you got me into, Grover.

92
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:21,190
- Do you want to come in?
- I... sort of already did.

93
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,911
You must be starving, so I made us
some cheese and vegetables -

94
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,150
- au naturel.

95
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:33,114
Would you like some wine
with your nose... cheese?

96
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,510
Wine would be fine.

97
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,229
- Do you have a straw?
- No, I do not. Why?

98
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,914
No particular reason.

99
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,071
Cheers.

100
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:22,033
Party trick...
Well, a nose by any other name.

101
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,317
"Would smell as sweet."

102
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,958
My name is C.D. Bales.
I am the fire chief. Call me Charlie.

103
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,998
I am Roxanne. Thank you for your help.

104
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,549
I know the lady who owns this house.

105
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,235
Dixie?
She gave me a good deal for the summer.

106
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,915
- Nice and cheap, I bet.
- Well, it is worth it.

107
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,116
This house has a great spot for that.

108
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,192
- I thought you would never ask.
- I did not.

109
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,112
What is it, the mummy?

110
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,429
It is a telescope, it is beautiful.

111
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,989
- You must know about M31.
- Yes.

112
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,277
I like it when they give
astronomical objects names.

113
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,355
Like Andromeda, Saturn and...
Sea of Tranquility.

114
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,479
This numbering thing is
too boring for us civilians.

115
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,514
Do you know how many objects
are up there?

116
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,433
I know it is over fifty.

117
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,390
I think they do well.
They have many things to name.

118
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,678
How about Moo-on, Gluon, Quark?

119
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,435
Do you know what a quark is?

120
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,119
I used to, I just forgot right now.

121
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,953
We do not know everything, do we?

122
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,554
Sit down and I will show you.

123
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,549
No one has ever seen a quark,
but we know they exist.

124
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,676
There are at least six different types:

125
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:54,836
Up, Down,
Strange, Charmed, Bottom and Top.

126
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,036
That is their flavour.

127
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,272
Top and Bottom Quarks
are most common.

128
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:05,355
Only an unusually exotic collision can
produce the Strange and the Charmed.

129
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,392
It is beautiful, is it not?

130
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,632
Yes. These are...
astronomical objects, then?

131
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,758
No, sub-nuclear particles.

132
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,674
I thought so.

133
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,832
- So, what are you looking for?
- I cannot tell you.

134
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,992
- Why is that?
- I cannot, it is a secret.

135
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,789
I have a few secrets,
some important ones, too.

136
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:33,590
Actually, I have one pretty impor...
I have one lousy one.

137
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,718
Actually,
I do not have any secrets at all.

138
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,348
It is just so depressing.

139
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,549
- Did you say your name was Roxanne?
- Yes.

140
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,951
It is unusual; it is pretty.

141
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,120
There is a name for a galaxy.

142
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,552
Sorry, I did not mean to wax rhapsodic.

143
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,076
I should go,
it is late and I have work to do.

144
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,152
Okay, but wish me luck.

145
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,312
- On what?
- Just wish me luck.

146
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,600
No, I do not believe in luck.
Wish for something to happen.

147
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:21,116
- I know what you mean. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

148
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,316
I am fine.

149
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,789
Roxanne.

150
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,794
It is a party town, maestro.
You will love it.

151
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,471
- <i>Gafornasemano.</i>
- What?

152
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,236
Were you playmate of the month,
June '85?

153
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,469
No.

154
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,997
That is funny, I thought I recognised
your inner diameter slope.

155
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,639
What is that?

156
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,588
The part of your leg
that curves into your inner thigh.

157
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,511
Works every time, maestro.

158
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,389
I call you maestro because
you are great with the chicks, right?

159
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,313
All right, men, let us go.

160
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,230
All right, are you ready?

161
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,115
What?

162
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,189
What is going on here?

163
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,509
Training.

164
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:50,833
I want it to say action with style.
Like a GQ fire fighter.

165
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,835
This is Chris, our new pro.
A <i>real</i> fire fighter.

166
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,788
Welcome, I am Mayor Deebs.
We did not expect you until Monday.

167
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:04,192
- I came early to get a good start.
- He is a maniac with the chicks, too.

168
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,909
This is Dean, Trent,
and my personal tailor, Sam.

169
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,672
I will show you your room.

170
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:14,072
- Cuffs or no cuffs?
- You better get off that hose.

171
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,915
Do you think I can get
the telescope up the stairs?

172
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,311
I will ask C.D.
to leave his encyclopedias.

173
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,790
- He reads encyclopedias?
- He <i>is</i> an encyclopedia.

174
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,554
- He is funny.
- Yes, he is great.

175
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,278
He is my god-brother.

176
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,390
These uniforms really work...

177
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,959
I can tell.

178
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,430
- What about your boyfriend?
- Richard.

179
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,798
- When is he coming?
- He is not coming.

180
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,269
What happened?

181
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,991
We just ran out of gas...
I guess I mistook sex for love.

182
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,833
I did that once, it was great.

183
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,712
Sandy is a very deep person.

184
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,915
Oh my God, who is that?

185
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,916
She can certainly make my night.

186
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,071
Who is she?

187
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,597
Sandy...

188
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,877
Who is that?

189
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,794
That is Roxanne.
She studies astronomy or astrology...

190
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,632
Is there a difference?

191
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,353
Look, someone is checking you out.

192
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,635
Now, he could cheer you up.

193
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,110
If I was you,
I would do something about that.

194
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,398
Maybe... Maybe later, maybe not.

195
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,994
You are playing it beautifully.

196
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,156
- Do you mind if I give it a shot?
- Go right ahead.

197
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,356
Thank you, maestro.

198
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:59,834
I would like to invite you
to a Nelson tradition of hot-tubbing.

199
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,228
Pardon me?

200
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,358
It is a tradition.
We consume mulled wine -

201
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,637
- and enjoy some outdoor hot-tubbing.

202
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:12,555
When the settlers came here
100 years ago, they started hot-tubbing?

203
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,236
What? ...Oh, yeah.
You are feisty, I like that.

204
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,231
His ego is the size of Brazil.

205
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,279
- I have to stop talking to you.
- Okay, no problem.

206
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:29,834
I will be over there. Think about it and
if you change your mind, come on over.

207
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,237
And I think you might.

208
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,391
If I do change my mind, you will know -

209
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:39,156
- because my breasts will be heaving
and moist with perspiration.

210
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,480
- So long, foxy.
- So long.

211
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:49,795
- Look! Only enough for one drink.
- This is what it is like being single.

212
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,236
- He has a great arse.
- Too bad it is on his shoulders.

213
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,913
He is cute.

214
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:59,551
I like cute, I just want to
meet someone with half a brain.

215
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,278
Good luck.

216
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,714
<i>He went up there before school</i>
<i>and will not come down.</i>

217
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,270
All right... I will see what I can do.

218
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,235
The name is Bales. B-a-l-e-s.

219
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:51,195
<i>He did it before,</i>
<i>but never stayed this long.</i>

220
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,590
<i>It is going to be all right, honey.</i>

221
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:06,110
What is the trouble, Peter?
Come on, what is the matter?

222
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,079
They call me "Porky" at school.

223
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,475
Why do they have to do that?
Goddamn it...

224
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,039
I should not say that in front of you.

225
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,197
Did you talk to your mother about it?

226
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:28,876
Once I tried. She said
I should clean up my plate first.

227
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:35,195
See, that is good. You are way better
than these guys who make fun of you.

228
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,794
You are smart and you are funny.

229
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:42,715
- You can make things up.
- I did not make it up. It is true.

230
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:48,877
Bastards!
I should not say that in front of you.

231
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,271
- Do I have to get down now?
- No.

232
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,834
Let us just stay up here for a while.

233
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:10,679
That is our new computer. We can
pinpoint any fire in town with that.

234
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,478
Yes, I can see that.

235
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,155
It is perfect for us...
we are the fire department.

236
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,753
That is perfect.

237
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,037
- Hi, I am Andy.
- Good to meet you.

238
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,476
I just wanted to welcome you.

239
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,829
There is one thing...
Have you met the chief?

240
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,592
No.

241
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,991
He is funny looking.
I would not mention it.

242
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,513
Of course not.

243
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,798
I figured you would not.
But sometimes, you know -

244
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:46,397
- things accidentally slip out
and then, you know...

245
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,991
Watch it on that stair.

246
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,072
Who designed these steps?
The Marquis de Sade?

247
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,231
Why is it so heavy? It is mostly air.

248
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,277
And glass, so be careful.

249
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:04,433
My aunt knitted one of these.
It was much lighter than this.

250
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:09,720
- This secret of yours relates to this?
- Sort of, yes.

251
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:14,874
What are you doing, Charlie?
I cannot hold this by myself!

252
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,313
You do not have to tell me.

253
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,038
Okay, I will tell you.

254
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,909
All right, start talking. Here we go.

255
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,352
I think I have discovered a comet.

256
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,790
It is no big deal,
there are a lot of comets.

257
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,996
I was working on this paper -

258
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:45,633
- on the ork cloud, and I discovered
a mathematical irregularity.

259
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:49,998
I have not climbed so many steps
since I went to the Maharishi.

260
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,349
I think it is a series of ten comets...
Watch it around this corner.

261
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:02,319
Or the forerunner of a big comet
which is due back this summer.

262
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,391
Will you find it with this?

263
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:08,109
No, my uncle is looking for it
in a big scope in Arizona.

264
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,032
I carried it up here for nothing?

265
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,955
Not really. Put that counter balance
on that arm with the key.

266
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,079
- So, what do you get if you are right?
- Nothing.

267
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:23,119
Well, I graduate, that is for sure...
And I get to name it.

268
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,636
That is pretty good. Sort of historical.

269
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,358
Comet Kowalski.

270
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,274
Why? You could give it a beautiful name.

271
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,557
- That is my name.
- It is? Roxanne Kowalski?

272
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,836
Oh, sorry.

273
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,070
So, when did you find out about this?

274
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:46,872
July 1 4, 22:08:31...
Give or take ten days.

275
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,558
- That would really be something.
- Yes.

276
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:03,269
Do not look now,
but the Viking just came in.

277
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:09,430
Come in, shake hands with the mayor.
You will look important.

278
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,192
He should be bronzed.

279
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,432
I am told you are
fast, efficient and brilliant -

280
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,795
- with the ladies.

281
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:22,316
If anything happens to you,
C.D. will be all over my Kazistkey...

282
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,916
- Get a hold of yourself.
- It is now or never.

283
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:51,873
- Do it, Roxanne.
- There is only one way to tell.

284
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,794
Okay, when he comes out -

285
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:00,033
- I will invite him
to a Nelson tradition of hot-tubbing, -

286
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:05,115
- and I will set him up with some
mulled wine, and I will bathe him a lot.

287
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,636
- I am shocked.
- I am not shocked.

288
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:14,473
Confidence, confidence... A little
water and I am ready to talk to her.

289
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,630
Oh, no!

290
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:54,271
- Do you remember me?
- I am trying to put it behind me.

291
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:59,639
- Is this your shop?
- Yes, all mine.

292
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:03,588
- It is perfect.
- Thank you very much.

293
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,912
- It is really you.
- I appreciate that.

294
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:13,473
Come in and check out the freeze-dried
animals, they are incredibly lifelike.

295
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,596
Maybe next time.

296
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:35,119
C.D., it came to me
last night in a flash.

297
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,429
What is that?

298
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:41,037
The thing, the gimmick:
The Nelson promotional cow!

299
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:46,277
You give her a name:
Suzy, Bossy...

300
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:51,195
You put her picture in our posters,
teaching her to drink a beer.

301
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,035
- These things work.
- I think it is a fantastic idea.

302
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,988
- You like it?
- I love it, I think it is great!

303
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:04,837
I think it is brilliant, what an idea!
And I was there, I saw it happen:

304
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,154
He took the idea, ripe on the tree.
He plucked it and he put it in his pocket.

305
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,198
It is, dare I say, genius?

306
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:19,629
No, no... but maybe it is. Maybe I am
in the presence of greatness...

307
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,632
- Have you met C.D. yet?
- No, not yet.

308
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:29,271
- There is something you should know.
- He has a big nose, right?

309
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:35,230
- Whatever you do, do not stare.
- Come on, I will not stare.

310
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:40,713
None of us would, but you get there
and you feel yourself not staring.

311
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,759
Then it seems obvious
you are not staring, so you will look -

312
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,559
- and you will think, "I am staring."

313
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:54,193
You think, "this is ridiculous",
so you take a good look, and you think:

314
00:27:54,360 --> 00:28:00,276
"I am looking at a man who, when he
washes his face, loses the bar of soap."

315
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:04,999
- Thank you, guys.
- Do not say we did not warn you.

316
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,949
You think people go to Sun Valley
to see their fire department?

317
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,317
No, work with me.
You have to use promotion.

318
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,268
That way the town grows and
the fire department grows.

319
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,671
You cannot run a fire department
with the 7 banana brothers -

320
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,353
- you need professionals.

321
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,956
This town could be another Aspen.
They make tons of money.

322
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,989
As soon as this Oktoberfest is over,
you will get your funds back.

323
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:47,790
I have a drink, then I start to relax and
then I start to have fun.

324
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,794
It is not something I want to start
at this point in my life.

325
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,950
I heard you were tough.

326
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,435
I am...

327
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,152
But if you use a little tenderizer,
I might cook up pretty good.

328
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,072
Arsehole.

329
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,356
Where are you going, big nose?

330
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,351
Pardon me?

331
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:17,397
You heard me, <i>big nose.</i>

332
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,789
- Is that it?
- Yes.

333
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,748
You really got me on that one,
did you not?

334
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,678
Wait a second...

335
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,710
What a waste of an opportunity.

336
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,395
Someone is standing
in front of you with this -

337
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:39,074
- and all you can think up is
"big nose"?

338
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,674
Can you think up something better?

339
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:46,078
Yes, I think I can think up
something better. Come here.

340
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,513
With this dart... I will think up
whatever number you hit.

341
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,356
Twenty!

342
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,877
Two out of three.

343
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:07,795
- Twenty.
- Darts Champion, Denver, 1 987.

344
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,159
Come on, Charlie, you can do it.

345
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,952
All right, twenty something betters.

346
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,555
I start with the obvious:

347
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:21,872
Excuse me, is that your nose
or did a bus park on your face?

348
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:27,319
Meterological:
Everybody take cover, she will blow!

349
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:31,758
Fashionable: You could de-emphasise
your nose if you wore something larger -

350
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,115
- like Wyoming.

351
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:40,035
Personal: Well, here we are...
Just the three of us.

352
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:45,069
Punctual: Okay, your nose was on time,
but you were 15 minutes late.

353
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,789
Envious: Oh, I wish I were you -

354
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,078
- to be able to smell your own ear!

355
00:30:54,560 --> 00:31:00,476
Naughty: Some of the ladies have asked
if you would put that thing away.

356
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,394
Philosophical: It is not the size
of a nose that is important -

357
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,870
- it is what is in it that matters.

358
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,679
Humorous:
Laugh and the world laughs with you -

359
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:14,435
- sneeze and it is goodbye, Seattle.

360
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:20,630
Commercial: Hi, I am Earl Scheib
and I can paint that nose for $39.95!

361
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,189
Polite:
Would you mind not bobbing your head?

362
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,477
The orchestra keeps changing the tempo.

363
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,039
Melodic: Everybody.

364
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:33,069
<i>He has got the whole world in his nose.</i>

365
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:40,430
Sympathetic: What happened?
Did your parents lose a bet with God?

366
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,558
Complimentary:
You must love the birdies -

367
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:47,156
- to give them this to perch on.

368
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:52,599
Scientific: Say, does that thing there
influence the tides?

369
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:56,992
Obscure: Whoa,
I would hate to see the grindstone.

370
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,639
Well, think about it.

371
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,553
Inquiry:
When you stop and smell the flowers -

372
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,314
- are they afraid?

373
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:12,835
French: The pigs have refused
to find any more truffles -

374
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,719
- until you leave.

375
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:21,796
Pornographic: Finally a man
who can satisfy two women at once.

376
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:28,279
- How many is that?
- Fourteen, Chief.

377
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:32,194
All right, religious:
The Lord giveth -

378
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,557
- and He just kept on giving, did he not?

379
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,438
Fifteen.

380
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:44,270
Disgusting:
Say, who mows your nose hair?

381
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,271
Sixteen.

382
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,831
Paranoid:
Keep that guy away from my cocaine!

383
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,831
Seventeen.

384
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,596
Aromatic: It must be wonderful to wake
up in the morning and smell the coffee -

385
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,036
- in Brazil.
- Eighteen.

386
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,191
Appreciative: Oh, how original.

387
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,193
Most people just have their teeth capped.

388
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,351
Nineteen.

389
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,517
All right...

390
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,793
<i>You can do it, C.D., one more.</i>

391
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:22,315
Dirty:
Your name would not be Dick, would it?

392
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,710
You smartarse son of a bitch!

393
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,395
You flat-faced, flat-nosed flathead.

394
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,559
Has he fallen yet?

395
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:49,153
Did that copy of
"Being and Nothingness" by Jean Paul...

396
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:53,233
Jean Paul Sartre? Yes, it did.
I have it here, it is paid for.

397
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:58,394
- Great, thank you.
<i>- De rien... Il n'y a pas de quoi.</i>

398
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:01,552
- Okay.
- Do not mention it, bro.

399
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:08,478
"Therefore, my body is a conscious
structure of my consciousness."

400
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:13,350
Thank you, Chris. I was too embarrassed
to go and ask for it myself.

401
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,239
A little light reading, Andy?

402
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,313
I got $9,000 for the house this summer.

403
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,995
- Which one of the five?
- The one on Rush Street.

404
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:28,631
- You are soaking Roxanne for $9,000?
- I am not.

405
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,794
- You like her, do you not?
- What is there not to like?

406
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:37,509
- Why do you not ask her out?
- No, I cannot.

407
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:41,355
I have a 3 o'clock and a
5 o'clock, the women are lined up...

408
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,239
Mostly because of the old saying -

409
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,870
- about a man's nose relating to
the size of...

410
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:51,749
- The size of what?
- Come on, everybody knows this.

411
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:55,549
Hey, Sophie. Do you know the old saying
about a man's nose?

412
00:34:55,720 --> 00:35:00,794
You mean how the size of a man's nose
relates to the size of his...?

413
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,115
Oh, my God!

414
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,476
I love doing it to them.

415
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:10,270
- Your tea, sir... and picks.
- Thank you.

416
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,992
So, why do you not ask her out?

417
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:19,236
Sometimes I take a walk at night and
I see couples walking, holding hands -

418
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,551
- and I look at them and I think:
"Why not me?"

419
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,713
Then I catch my shadow on the wall...

420
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:31,671
- Why do you not get that nose job?
- I did.

421
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:35,636
It is the word: Rhinoplasty.
It is as unpleasant -

422
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,791
- as haemorrhoids.

423
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,236
Those two words you do not want
to get involved in.

424
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:47,191
What about cosmetics? Shading along the
sides, down the slope, a bit on the end?

425
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:52,512
- It really helps.
- No, not for me. I cannot wear make up.

426
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,672
You should have stayed last night.

427
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,673
You were great, we were impressed.

428
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,354
Roxanne went on and on about you.

429
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,839
She did?

430
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,551
I think she is falling in love,
but she does not know it yet.

431
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:14,874
What does she mean,
"she thinks she is falling in love"?

432
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,713
It has been known to happen.

433
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,394
C.D., this is Chris McConnell.

434
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:40,634
It is a pleasure meeting you. I am sorry
we have been missing each other.

435
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,836
Are you all right?

436
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,356
I know you have met the guys...

437
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,548
How is your room?

438
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,398
It is hypnotic, is it not?

439
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,229
It is huge!

440
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:15,239
It is enormous, it is gigantic...

441
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:20,714
They said it was big,
but I did not expect it to be BIG.

442
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:31,469
Do you want to shoot some pool?
Rack them up, we will play a game.

443
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,389
You will not kill me? The guys said...

444
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:40,793
- Ordinarily I would, but not today.
- Why not?

445
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:47,115
Because yesterday she did not,
but today... she does.

446
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:59,998
You finally have a sense of humour
about your nose?

447
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,876
Rack them up.

448
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:13,108
Okay, turn on the hose. The secret to
moving a hose is in the rhythm.

449
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:18,718
To the left:
One and two and three.

450
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,919
To the right:
One and two and three.

451
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,275
Now forward.

452
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,755
Now back.

453
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,194
I cannot stand this.

454
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,589
Turn it off! What are you doing?

455
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,952
Turn it off! Turn it off!

456
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:09,556
Get a good stream.
Lean into it, trust it.

457
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,280
Remember: Water is your friend.

458
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,233
What is our signal
for charging the hose?

459
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,552
Remember, it is like Big Bird...
like on "Sesame Street".

460
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,479
No, not him again.

461
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:48,193
There he is...
Back up a second.

462
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,676
Flirting with Sophie and Lydia again.

463
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,559
Charlie, can I talk to you?

464
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,870
Well...

465
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,475
All right.

466
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,310
Okay, was I right?

467
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:15,871
- Yes, it is ugly.
- It really is.

468
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,675
- What I will say is a little forward...
- Good.

469
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:29,029
There is someone I think
I should get to know better.

470
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,509
Someone who I think likes me too.

471
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,353
- You know what I mean?
- Yes.

472
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,829
I think he wants to talk to me.

473
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,516
I can see him trying, but he will not.
I like him for that.

474
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:45,798
Maybe this guy needs you
to make the first move.

475
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,520
That is why I am talking to you.

476
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,631
So... what do you know about this guy?

477
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,268
I know he is interesting...

478
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:00,154
- Different.
- Yes.

479
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:04,359
Intelligent.
Handsome.

480
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:08,638
- He is what?
- He is handsome.

481
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:14,193
Is it not amazing? If you have feelings
for someone, you see them as handsome?

482
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:18,672
- Everyone thinks he is.
- No, not everyone, believe me.

483
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,513
What are you talking about?

484
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,791
Nothing.
It is great that he is all these things.

485
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:31,670
I have only seen him a few times.
We have never even spoken -

486
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:35,150
- we just exchanged
some goofy looks.

487
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:40,519
- Why are you telling me this?
- He works for you. Chris McConnell.

488
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:46,475
What is he like? No, do not tell me.
I will let it unfold.

489
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:51,871
Since you are working with him,
maybe you could encourage him.

490
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:55,953
He may not say anything all summer
and then I will be gone.

491
00:41:56,120 --> 00:42:00,238
- If it comes up.
- C.D., thank you.

492
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,311
I know I am forward.

493
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,958
You were really great the other night.

494
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,714
It is the first time
I have seen anyone be brave.

495
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,553
I have been a lot braver since then.

496
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,837
This time I want you to do it.
Cut it off!

497
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,356
I am tired of having a magnificent,
fabulous, interesting nose.

498
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,876
I want a cute,
petite, little button nose.

499
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:33,431
- Give me the American beauty.
- C.D., you know I cannot.

500
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:37,070
Yes you can, get the knife. Cut it, Dave.

501
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:43,475
I cannot. Allergies to anesthetics are
dangerous; you will go into a coma.

502
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:47,155
We will do it the old-fashioned way.

503
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,595
Do not be stupid.

504
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:55,515
- I want to look like Diana Ross.
- What you want is psychotherapy.

505
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:59,878
I can hear it now:
"Get used to it. $85, please."

506
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:06,157
Have you ever thought you
were born with this nose for a reason?

507
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,231
Oh yes -

508
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,790
- like opening coke bottles.

509
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:24,712
Can I look at those nose cards
one more time?

510
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,996
Yes, sure.

511
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,598
Hello darling,
I have not seen you in a while.

512
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:59,510
She is so beautiful,
I saw her in that bar...

513
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:03,229
- She is interesting, too.
- Yes, did you see her legs?

514
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,231
She also has a sense of humour.

515
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:10,997
She wants to meet me? I cannot
believe this; God, my third day here...

516
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,310
She is smart, too. Astrology...

517
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:15,710
- Astronomy.
- Yes, right.

518
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,871
God, we will meet, really?

519
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:21,395
So what do I do?

520
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,516
How do I meet her?

521
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:27,956
How about you walk up to her
and say hello?

522
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:31,590
No, then I would have to talk to her.

523
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,830
What are you talking about?

524
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:40,393
Around you guys I can relax and be
myself... I am funny, you know that.

525
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:46,112
But around women I get a little...
It is not that I do not like them.

526
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,589
I just get a little nervous.

527
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:51,558
Okay,
get her telephone number and call her.

528
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:54,792
Pass. Then I would have to talk to her.

529
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,837
I wanted to talk to her really bad -

530
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,710
- but I did not, because that is how
I would have talked to her: bad.

531
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:07,830
So every time you meet a woman
with charm and style and legs, -

532
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,719
- you will turn around and run.

533
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,236
That is a great idea. It is brilliant.

534
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:18,270
It is a dumb game; why do we play it?

535
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:21,671
- Tough game?
- We are on our way there.

536
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:27,399
- Do you know what "carpe diem" is?
- Some kind of fish, fish bait?

537
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:31,439
No, it is Latin.
It means, "seize the day".

538
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,750
There may be no tomorrow, so do it now.

539
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,753
Seek life now, while you have the chance.

540
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:41,152
- You think I should go after Roxannne?
- No, I would not. I would wait.

541
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:43,311
Mail her a letter.

542
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:48,715
Okay, light the thing, see how you do.

543
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,320
<i>C.D., come here. I have got it!</i>

544
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,118
You have got it all right.

545
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,352
How to talk to Roxanne.
I will take a chance.

546
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:18,354
The girl likes me, what am I afraid of?
She is no rocket scientist.

547
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:21,512
Actually, she is a rocket scientist.

548
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:26,674
But of all the guys she likes me, right?
So what am I afraid of? Nothing.

549
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:30,628
I will do as you said...
I will write her a letter.

550
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,190
I have a way with words.
I always crack the guys up.

551
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:38,273
This way I can plan what to say.
I can craft it.

552
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:42,274
In a letter I can be...
effer-goddamn-vescent.

553
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:49,596
- We cannot get it started.
- I will be out in a minute.

554
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:55,998
- Andy, your coat is on fire.
- Yeah, right.

555
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,316
So what do you think?

556
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,790
- What?!
- He is on fire, get his coat!

557
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:04,155
No! Not the gasoline!

558
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:09,033
Can I help you?

559
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:14,479
Yes, I have a friend who is looking for
a cosmetic, if one exits -

560
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:21,193
- a sort of a shading arrangement.
Do you have anything in the shading area?

561
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:27,196
We have lots of blushers and things...
What specifically is it for?

562
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:33,196
She has this feature that she would
like to... de-emphasise.

563
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:40,116
I see, she has this extra large feature
and she wants to make it look smaller?

564
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,470
I think a dark contour would be fine.

565
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:49,875
Great. How would she go about...
applying this thing?

566
00:47:52,760 --> 00:48:00,030
She would... just shade the area of the
feature to make it look...

567
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:06,317
It would appear to be more shadows
and less actual... acreage.

568
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,916
- I mean area.
- I will take it.

569
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:13,197
- I will get a fresh one from the back.
- Thank you.

570
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:19,434
I talked to Chris for you.

571
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,870
Great.

572
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,110
Do you think he will call me?

573
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,589
He wants to write you a letter.

574
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:34,116
A letter? Is that not usually
at the end of a relationship?

575
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:39,229
No, it is really romantic, actually.
I will explain it to you outside.

576
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:42,039
C.D., here is your blush.

577
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:46,318
- Could you giftwrap that for me?
- Okay.

578
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,517
These items I decided against.

579
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:57,073
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- No, it is for my sister.

580
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:02,109
- You have a sister?
- No, it is for my sister's girlfriend.

581
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:30,271
Hi, Chris.
No, I am not doing anything.

582
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:33,557
Just baking some eggs.

583
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,072
Sure, come on over. Bye.

584
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:42,074
You should read the letter
before I send it.

585
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:45,073
Great, we will take a look at it.

586
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:50,916
- It is quite an operation you have.
- Thank you.

587
00:49:56,360 --> 00:50:01,229
- Let us take a look at that letter.
- I think it is really good.

588
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,993
"Dear Roxanne, how is it going?
Do you want to have a drink sometime?

589
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,833
If you do, check this box."

590
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:16,837
- How long did you work on this?
- Today. Since noon.

591
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,279
Chris, that is a very long time.
You cannot send her this.

592
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,839
What do you mean?

593
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,310
I like the concept,
but it has to be more interesting.

594
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:29,993
I worked hard on that!

595
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:35,075
Take a pen, sit down and let me ask you
a question: how do you feel about her?

596
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:40,155
- Me, about her?
- How did you feel when you first saw her?

597
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:41,958
Horny.

598
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:47,318
Okay, you cannot say you felt horny,
you have to change it.

599
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:50,950
You have to say, " I felt... moved, -

600
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:56,109
- alive... on fire."

601
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:57,913
That is beautiful.

602
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:01,390
How did you feel
when you first spoke to her?

603
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:03,551
Like a dickhead.

604
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:06,314
No, you cannot write that.

605
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:12,669
You have to say, "I felt like a child
standing in the sun for the first time -

606
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:16,116
- feeling only your radiance."

607
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:20,831
"Radiance"; I like that.
I will underline that.

608
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,878
What did you do after you saw her?

609
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,633
I puked.

610
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:35,629
After seeing you...
my only nourishment was you.

611
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,076
- C.D., you write the letter.
- No, you do it.

612
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:44,472
You know how to say what I feel.
You write it and I will sign it.

613
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:50,237
No, no, that is... dangerous.
That is lying.

614
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,630
Not if you write what I feel.

615
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:56,713
I sign my name and you write
what you imagine I am feeling.

616
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:00,714
- It will work.
- What I imagine you are feeling?

617
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,791
It is half-written already.

618
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:06,077
You have to change that poetic baloney.

619
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,958
This is beautiful.

620
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:11,829
No, for Roxanne
you need something startling -

621
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:18,394
- something so strange it would
make her incapable of being reasonable.

622
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:21,870
- Can you do it?
- It is an challenge.

623
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,956
Get your favourite pen.

624
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:26,475
These are good.

625
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:31,634
And some good quality paper
that really takes the ink.

626
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,678
- Oh, the food!
- I will take care of it.

627
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:37,229
You just take your time.

628
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,595
Come on, boys, line up.

629
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:16,638
- Six and a half minutes, not bad.
- Let us get into our gear.

630
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,630
Let us go, boys.
It is Operation Snowball.

631
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,313
Snowball!

632
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:36,478
Take the truck!

633
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:54,675
Snowball, come on.

634
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:50,315
Hi, how are you doing, Chief?
All is well that ends well.

635
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:58,914
Boys, the ladder is up. Boys!

636
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:02,793
Wait, boys. The ladder is up!

637
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:28,518
Let me show you a double binary,
just focus with this.

638
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:32,159
You will see it, I am on a schedule.

639
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:35,990
Roxanne, what is a light year?

640
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:39,675
Same as a regular year,
it just has less calories.

641
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,628
What is it?

642
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:46,951
It is two pairs of stars
revolving around each other, -

643
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:50,271
- but so far away
they look like one.

644
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:54,513
- What keeps them together?
- Mutual attraction.

645
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:57,513
That is fairly romantic.

646
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:02,559
"Strange attractors
in my window of possible movement."

647
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,312
Say again?

648
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:07,438
"Passionate kisses
I hope you will read with your lips."

649
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:10,068
- Roxanne?
- Sorry.

650
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:13,833
It is something from a letter I got...

651
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:16,831
An amazing letter.

652
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,551
- You liked it?
- No, I did not like it. I loved it.

653
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:25,076
- Whose letter?
- Chris.

654
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:28,198
- He can write?
- I am melting.

655
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:32,791
Let me show you that dumbbell nebula.

656
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:37,590
There is something I do not get...

657
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:42,515
The guy dodges me for days, so I think,
"Okay, he is not interested."

658
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:44,511
C.D. tells me of the letter -

659
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:48,195
- so I figure it is about
why he will not talk to me.

660
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:50,112
But it is not.

661
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:53,795
It was strange and... intelligent -

662
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:55,757
- and sexual.

663
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:01,555
Why is he writing?
He only lives a block and a half away.

664
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,556
Charlie?

665
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:09,550
Do you want me
to ask him out for you?

666
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,676
She wants a date?

667
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,234
C.D., it is all because of you.

668
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:29,034
Hey, what is the matter?

669
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:34,352
She wants to see me tonight?
I cannot see her tonight.

670
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,636
I am already a wreck.

671
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:38,836
Relax.

672
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,834
You have to help me.
If I talk to her, I will die.

673
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,515
Here is what we do:
I give you something to memorise.

674
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:50,195
- I cannot memorise.
- Anyone can memorise.

675
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:53,909
Say the Pledge of Allegiance.
You memorised that, right?

676
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:59,791
Okay, I said,
"I pledge allegiance to the flag of..."

677
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,317
...which country, I do not know.

678
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,710
We will think of something.

679
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:23,672
- No letter this time, just face to face.
- Yes.

680
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:29,954
- Do you want to sit outside?
- Do I want to sit outside? Yes.

681
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:33,954
- Here?
- Here on the porch, yes.

682
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:39,515
- We can sit right here.
- Great.

683
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:50,068
- It is a lovely evening.
- Oh, yes... It is an exquisite evening.

684
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:58,236
Filled with... mysterious portents.
Magic and romance.

685
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:06,275
- Why are you wearing that hat?
- Why? ...Because...

686
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:09,271
Do not panic, stay calm.

687
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:16,513
Because tonight... I am a hunter.

688
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:22,198
Because tonight... I am a hunter.
Hunting for words.

689
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:24,838
That is good, it is okay.

690
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,956
Am I your prey?

691
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:30,238
Yes, but not a defenceless one.

692
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:35,189
Yes... but not a defenceless one.

693
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:40,398
Not a rabbit.
You are a lioness.

694
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:45,551
Alert and sensitive...

695
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:49,998
Alert and sensitive to every mis-step.

696
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:54,917
Move a little closer to her.

697
00:59:55,880 --> 01:00:01,352
Therefore I must move silently,
moving in towards you.

698
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:03,918
Reach out your hand.

699
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:10,789
I hand out... reaching to...
Car three, proceed to the 279.

700
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:12,479
What?

701
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:16,197
<i>Confirm, car three, confirm.</i>

702
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:17,679
Confirm what?

703
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:22,590
Confirm my feelings.

704
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:26,309
- Confirm my feelings.
- Yes.

705
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:35,713
Because there is a heart here...
that wants yours to know -

706
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:38,593
- there is a possible 502 on Main.

707
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:41,789
<i>Proceed to Main, confirm.</i>

708
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:54,313
Are you not a hunter anymore?

709
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:58,758
Not a hunter? No, I mean...

710
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:04,268
It is really nice out, is it not?

711
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:08,713
It is really, really...
what is the word I am looking for?

712
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:12,350
Nice, yes, that is it.

713
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:16,233
So, now you are the weatherman?

714
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:24,996
I loved your letter.
It was beautiful.

715
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:27,674
Where did you learn to write like that?

716
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:32,550
- The usual places.
- It seemed very extemporaneous.

717
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:35,472
Thank you.

718
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:40,794
Say something.
Something wonderful like in your letter.

719
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:44,236
- Let us see.
- You can tell me about the night.

720
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:48,439
The night... is very extemporaneous.

721
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:51,637
- What?
<i>- It is wild.</i>

722
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:56,590
Yes... the night is wild.
Like love can be wild.

723
01:01:56,760 --> 01:02:00,435
Love is wild, wild and extemporaneous.

724
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,919
Say something romantic.

725
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:13,317
"Why do birds suddenly appear
everytime you are near?"

726
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:18,069
- Is that not from a song?
- They made it into a song.

727
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:20,276
You wrote the song?

728
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:24,750
No... but I like that song.

729
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:33,072
Use your own words.

730
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:37,991
You have -

731
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:41,591
- a great body.

732
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:47,073
Your knockers, I mean your breasts,
are like melons...

733
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:50,357
Not melons, like pillows.

734
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:53,713
Can I fluff your pillows?

735
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:55,872
I have to go in now.

736
01:02:56,040 --> 01:03:00,830
Wait! ...Were you not playmate
of the month in June '85?

737
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:13,399
- "Can I fluff your pillows?"
- I got flustered, I panicked.

738
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:16,120
You have to help me,
it was working.

739
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:18,794
I do not think I could after that.

740
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:24,112
She wants somebody who looks like me
and talks like you.

741
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,797
No, come here.

742
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:40,314
Do not make me do it.

743
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:43,756
Stand under the window,
I will be out of sight.

744
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:47,959
- I whisper to you what to say.
- Wait, what if she hears you?

745
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:50,236
Just call her.

746
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:52,950
Roxanne?

747
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:01,517
Go easy for once!

748
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:04,513
Goddamn it, what are you doing?

749
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:06,318
I am sorry, hold on.

750
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:10,439
- Listen to me, I have a lot to say.
- Go away!

751
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:14,957
- I just want to tell you that...
- That I am really built?

752
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:19,557
- No, nothing like that.
- Tell her you were an idiot.

753
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:22,075
I was an idiot, Roxanne.

754
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:23,753
Wait, come here!

755
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:27,276
I... C.D. help me -

756
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:30,910
- want to say that I was an idiot.

757
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:33,913
I was... happy? dizzy?

758
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:36,478
Thirsty?

759
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:40,392
This is stupid.
Stupid!

760
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:43,552
I was stupid and I was also...

761
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:47,154
Tripping? ...bumbling.

762
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:52,795
I was a stupid, bumbling... pointer.

763
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:54,995
Pointer?

764
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:58,277
No, no... stupid ass.

765
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:03,319
So why did you say those things?

766
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:06,994
Tell her you were afraid.

767
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:11,915
- Because I was afraid.
- Of me? Afraid of what?

768
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:14,389
Tell her you were afraid of words.

769
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:16,869
- What?
- Words.

770
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:19,838
Because I was afraid of worms, Roxanne!

771
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:23,476
Worms!?

772
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,195
What are you saying to me?

773
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:32,519
When I said "worms"
I meant "words", Roxanne.

774
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:34,272
Give me your coat.

775
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:40,276
Words are all used up, they are hard
to say, they have all been wasted -

776
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:45,468
- on the shampoo commercials
and the ads and the flavourings.

777
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:50,919
Hollow, beautiful words.
How can you love a floor wax?

778
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:52,752
How can you love a diaper?

779
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:57,789
How can I use the same word about you
that is used about a stuffing?

780
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:01,077
I am exploding with love,
but cannot use the word.

781
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:02,958
I cannot hear you.

782
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:08,513
It is because my words have to rise up,
they have trouble finding you.

783
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:13,390
- You can hear me.
- That is because your voice floats down.

784
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:17,678
One hard word from you
at that height kills me.

785
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:19,876
Give me your hat.

786
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:25,473
Your voice sounds different.

787
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:34,269
Of course, I do not have to be careful
anymore. I am protected by the night.

788
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:40,308
I can be myself, Roxanne.
Oh God, your name is like a knife.

789
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:42,357
Stand where I can see you.

790
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:45,830
- No!
- Why?

791
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:51,789
Only my voice, you do not need
to see me, just listen to me.

792
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:57,034
I only have a minute to talk to you.
Did what I wrote touch you?

793
01:06:58,040 --> 01:06:59,996
It did.

794
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:03,317
It was eloquent.

795
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:07,314
No, not eloquent, just honest.

796
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:17,037
I am in orbit around you,
I am suspended weightless over you -

797
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:20,556
- like the blue man in the Chagall, -

798
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:25,551
- hanging over you in a delirious kiss.

799
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:31,793
Yesterday, on the street...
I swore I heard your name.

800
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:40,109
I turned and there was nobody there.
Just five birds rising off the ground -

801
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:44,990
- and when their wings hit the air,
I heard your name again.

802
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:51,156
Just for that second I was one of them,
pounding out your name: Roxanne.

803
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:57,236
Roxanne. A word of two syllables
locked inside my head.

804
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:05,515
You see... I am...
and I will always be -

805
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:10,672
- the one who loved you
without limits.

806
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:14,628
What are you talking about?
It is too much.

807
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:18,190
- Go on.
- It is working, go on.

808
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:28,514
This is my whole life right now.
Standing here talking to you like this.

809
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:32,389
Saying things I wanted to say,
but could not.

810
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:35,120
Why could you not talk to me?

811
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:38,556
I was afraid you would laugh at me.

812
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:42,633
- That is silly.
- No, not if you knew.

813
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:47,078
When you are reaching for a star,
there is a long way to fall.

814
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:50,596
I almost never let this moment happen.

815
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:55,276
Now I feel sorry for people for whom
it never comes.

816
01:08:56,800 --> 01:09:02,238
I love you. I have breathed you in
and I am suffocating.

817
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:08,917
I am crazy, I cannot go on.
This is all too much.

818
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:15,394
- I am starting to feel a little dizzy.
- I am starting to feel a little drunk.

819
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:19,997
Because I have
made you tremble up there, have I not?

820
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:23,910
Like a leaf on a tree.

821
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:27,595
- I want to make love to you.
- Shut up, Chris.

822
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:29,637
What?

823
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:37,631
I was telling myself to shut up
because this time I have gone too far.

824
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:40,870
I will be the judge of that.

825
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:43,156
She wants us.

826
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:47,598
C.D., it is okay.
Sooner or later.

827
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:50,958
You can do it.

828
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:01,954
Do not think I do not know you and
have not felt you beneath me.

829
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:05,476
I know you have imagined it,
have you not?

830
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:08,074
Lying back into your bed with me.

831
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:11,230
I have.

832
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:15,590
There will never be another tonight.

833
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:20,629
Why should we sip from a tea cup,
when we can drink from the river?

834
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:26,958
There is a tiny word; it is not a noun,
it is not a verb -

835
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:30,829
- it is not an adjective,
I do not know what it is.

836
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:35,391
But if you said it to me tonight,
all this blackness would go away.

837
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:40,395
You and I would be connected
by a tunnel of light.

838
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:45,553
- What is the word, Chris?
- Yes.

839
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:56,476
Yes.

840
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,228
Yes, Chris.

841
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,630
Great, we did it.

842
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:12,836
C.D., we were great.

843
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:17,399
I think I am in love.

844
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:21,913
Oh God, I did it!

845
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:38,234
Ooh, C.D., are you all right?
Did you hurt yourself?

846
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:40,391
- Where am I?
- You are in Nelson.

847
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:44,553
Nelson? I am home.
They brought me home.

848
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:48,872
- What day is it?
- Friday. "Dallas" is on.

849
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:53,238
Friday? Then it took no time.
It did not exist in time.

850
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:58,269
Suddenly a spacecraft
landed right in front of me.

851
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:02,068
I have read about it.
Did it have lights?

852
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:06,711
Lights? You never saw so many lights.
It was like Broadway.

853
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:12,398
A creature with big suckers on his palms
came out, he walked like this.

854
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:15,875
He put his palms right in my face, -

855
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:19,316
- took me over to Roxanne's
to observe me.

856
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:20,959
At Roxanne's house?

857
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:25,794
This is bullshit; we will miss "Dallas".
Let us go.

858
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:30,633
- You think I am nuts.
- No.

859
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:33,234
They asked me about older women.

860
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:37,313
They wanted to have sex with them
here in Nelson.

861
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:42,190
They will start a colony of supermen who
will have sex with older women because:

862
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:44,191
"They really know what they are doing."

863
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:47,079
It has been so long.

864
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:49,959
Do you believe in these creatures -

865
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:52,714
- wanting to have sex with older women?

866
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:57,032
Let us go and check it out.

867
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:19,592
God, I was nervous last night.
Uncomfortable.

868
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:22,115
I did not say anything, I am too dumb -

869
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:24,999
- I mean, too smart for that.

870
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,912
What do you mean nervous?
How nervous?

871
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:32,197
- Just real nervous.
- Really nervous?

872
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:38,559
You mean so nervous you could not...

873
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:42,315
God, come on, it is embarrassing.

874
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:49,479
Look, I could not do it -

875
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:51,756
- the third time.

876
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:54,115
The moment we have all been waiting for.

877
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:57,716
Let Oktoberfest... begin!

878
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:04,117
You cannot get anything going here!

879
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:09,709
Is C.D. in?

880
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:18,035
I am catching a plane in 20 minutes.

881
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:21,078
- Why?
- I got a call from the university.

882
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:25,392
- I was right about the comet.
- Fantastic!

883
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:28,597
I wanted to tell you first.

884
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:32,594
Congratulations, that is great.
You are famous.

885
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:36,639
- Is Chris around?
- No, I have not seen him.

886
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:39,394
Maybe you can tell him where I am?

887
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:42,870
I will be gone for about a week.
Here is my address.

888
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:45,315
Ask him to write me.

889
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:47,835
Tell him to knock me over.

890
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:55,437
I was walking on air, now I am walking
on feathers, on pillows on air.

891
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:04,152
A beer?

892
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:08,791
- Draft?
- Yes, but I can just put on my sweater.

893
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:16,514
That is so funny. There are so many guys
in here with no sense of humour.

894
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:21,958
I think a sense of humour is important.

895
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:24,873
I think it is really important, too.

896
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:31,793
- A hand of low-ball for your drink.
- What is low-ball?

897
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:34,793
You try to get the worst hand.

898
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,960
Okay, a low-ball for a high-ball.

899
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:44,391
You are a riot.

900
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:50,834
You could be a dealer in Vegas.

901
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:55,710
I went to Tahoe with my girlfriend.
We will move there in 3 days.

902
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:02,431
They like young cocktail waitresses there;
you can make big money.

903
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:05,797
I heard one girl got a $1 0,000 tip
from a lucky gambler.

904
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:08,428
10 grand?

905
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:10,670
That would be nice.

906
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:16,119
When I get older I will move to Reno;
they like older cocktail waitresses.

907
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:19,875
It is only 60 miles away...
What have you got?

908
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:24,397
I have a nine, seven, five,
three and a deuce.

909
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:27,675
That is the worst hand I ever saw.

910
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:31,148
You win.

911
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:38,312
- Where are you from?
- Albuquerque.

912
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:42,996
A-l-b-u-q-u-e-r-q-u-e...
It is an old bar bet.

913
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:47,996
Do you know where I want to go?

914
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:50,037
San Fransisco.

915
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:53,033
I have been there.

916
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:57,557
It is great; I am really a 49ers fan
not so much the Giants...

917
01:16:57,720 --> 01:17:03,192
The Redwoods, you should see them.
I would like to go there and just be.

918
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:06,193
I always take a meat sandwich with me.

919
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:10,954
It is great you have travelled.
You are interesting.

920
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:12,997
I try to be.

921
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:16,190
When you find somebody interesting, -

922
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:19,113
- you become interesting to that person.

923
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:24,475
- Are you seeing Roxanne?
- Kind of, but not...

924
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:28,315
I should quit talking to you,
she is a friend.

925
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:31,995
No, we can talk. It is no problem.

926
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:37,556
Next you will tell me about New York.

927
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:42,271
- I have been to New York.
- I was just kidding, you really have!

928
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:45,193
- My name is Chris.
- I know.

929
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:48,358
I am Sandy.

930
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:51,159
It is good to meet you.

931
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:05,314
You loved the little birds so much
you gave them this to perch on.

932
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:37,072
Thank you for the help, ladies...

933
01:19:57,160 --> 01:20:00,470
- What is up?
- Nothing.

934
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:05,357
Do you want a drink?

935
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:10,155
Yes, but if I ask for one more...
Give it to me.

936
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:15,234
Ralston, could you bring us
a bottle of wine, please?

937
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:24,919
What can you sit on, sleep on
and brush your teeth with?

938
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:32,036
I do not know.

939
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:35,272
A chair, a bed and a toothbrush.

940
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:40,353
- Your wine is right here.
- Thank you.

941
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:44,511
What is the point?

942
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:48,798
Sometimes the answer is so obvious
you do not see it.

943
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:51,872
It is as plain as the nose on your face.

944
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:56,591
- You should tell her.
- Tell who what?

945
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:00,672
Tell Roxanne that you love her.

946
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:10,197
- Actually, I already told her.
- You did?

947
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:14,911
- Last week I made love to her.
- Great!

948
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:18,914
It was not actually me,
it was sort of me, but...

949
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:23,995
It was me who said all the right
things, made her feel the right way.

950
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:29,792
It just was not the actual me
who did... the honours.

951
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:37,273
Never have I seen such a dead place.

952
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:40,193
Dixie, did you serve tripe quiche again?

953
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:42,510
Why are you not wearing fur tonight?

954
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:47,879
Chris asked me to stand in for him.
Roxanne called; she is coming to town.

955
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:51,394
I have to tell him about the letters.

956
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:33,511
Coming.

957
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:37,996
Just a second, I will be right back.

958
01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:50,958
What are you doing here?

959
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:53,156
There was no one there.

960
01:22:54,160 --> 01:22:57,038
- What?
- There was no one there.

961
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:08,955
What is going on?

962
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:11,270
I will get it.

963
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:38,149
Probably just kids...
Damn kids nowadays.

964
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:45,872
- Guess why I came back early?
- The door again.

965
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:48,793
There was no doorbell.

966
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:51,076
There it was again, I heard it.

967
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:54,118
Probably some kids. I will get it now.

968
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:57,875
- There was no doorbell.
- I will take care of it.

969
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:09,591
There it was again.

970
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:12,877
She might mention some letters.

971
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:15,395
You wrote her a few letters.

972
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:18,028
- How many?
- Three a day.

973
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:20,839
Six days, six times three is eighteen!

974
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,070
Well, twenty.

975
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:25,117
Twenty or so...

976
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:33,276
Nobody there.

977
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:39,716
Chris... do you know why
I came back early?

978
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:43,555
Every day, every hour
you sent me something new.

979
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:46,792
I could not stand it. I had to see you.

980
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:50,270
It was just letters...
Twenty or so.

981
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:53,989
- Think of what you wrote.
- I am trying.

982
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:59,195
- Wait... I want to know the real you.
- No!

983
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:01,555
The one I spoke to at the window.

984
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:04,314
This is the real me, good old Chris.

985
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:08,951
I like hanging out,
lifting weights; I am into my body.

986
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:11,395
You do not have to do that with me.

987
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:14,711
I know you and love you
from your letters.

988
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:17,075
Is it not enough I am cute?

989
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:21,634
Do you not see,
it would not matter if you were ugly.

990
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:23,358
No!

991
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:27,308
- Teach me what you know.
- I can play the guitar a little.

992
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:30,040
- We could travel.
- No, I hate pasta.

993
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:34,193
- I want to go to concerts with you.
- We could... boogie, or what?

994
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:37,432
- We can just talk, Chris.
- Talk?

995
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:39,636
Roxanne, I -

996
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:42,830
- am feeling a little...

997
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,719
I am not feeling well, I have to go.

998
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:21,754
So? Are you coming or not?

999
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:24,997
Yes.

1000
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:31,790
- Will you tell her?
- I cannot.

1001
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:37,357
Chris, you have to tell her,
it is not nice.

1002
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:42,198
Do you have any paper?
I could write her.

1003
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:44,715
I have experience at that.

1004
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:48,873
I have some in my glove compartment.
I will get it.

1005
01:26:55,760 --> 01:27:01,596
Roxanne called. She sounded really weird,
she wants you to come over right away.

1006
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:07,791
- Jerry, it is a re-match.
- He owes me 50 bucks.

1007
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:18,477
Come in.

1008
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:28,636
- What is it?
- Read this.

1009
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:37,189
"Dear Roxanne. I have met someone else,
and she is real cute, too.

1010
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:41,069
I hope I have not hurt you,
but I probably did.

1011
01:27:41,240 --> 01:27:46,360
It was really nice knowing you,
and now I am going to be a dealer in Tahoe.

1012
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:48,715
Yours truly -

1013
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:52,350
- t-r-u-l-e-y, Chris."

1014
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:58,958
Then I found this along with it
under the door.

1015
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:08,790
Read it... read it out loud.

1016
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:14,997
"All day long I think,

1017
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:20,312
'Where is she, what is she doing now?"

1018
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:27,998
Occasionally, I see you on the street
and I feel the nerves in my stomach -

1019
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:30,958
- a wave crashing over me."

1020
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:35,470
- It is so him.
- Go on.

1021
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:40,030
"I remember everything about you; -

1022
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:45,228
- every move
no matter how insignificant it may seem.

1023
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:49,234
July 1 1, 2:30 in the afternoon.

1024
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:57,269
You changed your hair...
not that much, but I noticed.

1025
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:02,518
It was as though
I had looked at the sun too long.

1026
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:07,834
I could close my eyes
and see it again and again.

1027
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:14,789
The way your hair moved, your walk,
your dress, everywhere I looked."

1028
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:22,714
It is nice, is it not?

1029
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:26,472
It has a... I feel...

1030
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:30,918
- Finish it.
- I did, it just runs out.

1031
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:33,674
You have to turn it over.

1032
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:40,470
"C.D. wrote this. Call me.
Dixie."

1033
01:29:43,080 --> 01:29:48,279
I went through all of the other letters.
They are all in the same hand.

1034
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:53,195
It was your voice under the balcony.
Chris did not write the letters, you did.

1035
01:29:56,680 --> 01:29:58,750
Yes.

1036
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:06,315
All this time right there in front of me,
and I could not even see you.

1037
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:11,279
You bastard!
How could you trick me like that?

1038
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:13,351
I tried to make you feel good.

1039
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:16,637
- You played with me.
- You should have guessed it.

1040
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:21,078
- So, it is my fault?
- The signatures do not match the letters.

1041
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:23,993
You do not check that in a love letter.

1042
01:30:24,160 --> 01:30:27,072
Because you wanted to believe it.

1043
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:31,711
All the romance wrapped up
in a cute nose and a cute arse.

1044
01:30:31,880 --> 01:30:33,996
You even got me in bed!

1045
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:38,711
- Yes, on your first date!
- Only because <i>you</i> seduced me.

1046
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:43,158
You went to bed with him too fast.
One frilly word and you are horizontal.

1047
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:46,437
I do not think
I went to bed with <i>him.</i>

1048
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:50,479
Somebody was up there,
it sure was not me.

1049
01:30:50,640 --> 01:30:53,916
Then who?
Chris could not have seduced me.

1050
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:58,437
- That is just what I told Dixie.
- You told Dixie?

1051
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:01,239
I just mentioned it, I did not mean to...

1052
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:03,834
You son of a bitch! You bastard!

1053
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,797
How could you lie?

1054
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:09,077
I tried to tell you
how I felt about you.

1055
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:12,198
It was a lousy way of telling me!

1056
01:31:12,360 --> 01:31:14,271
Just get out!

1057
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:17,316
Wait a second, I am out. Get in!

1058
01:31:17,480 --> 01:31:20,040
- No, get out!
- Get in!

1059
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:23,590
- Get off this porch.
- Fine.

1060
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:28,629
Do not try throwing my hat at me.

1061
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:35,988
Guess what the rest of the letter said?
It said, "P.S. I was only kidding."

1062
01:31:36,680 --> 01:31:41,470
- Ten more seconds and I am leaving.
- What did you say?

1063
01:31:41,640 --> 01:31:44,552
Ten more seconds and I am leaving.

1064
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:49,555
- What did you think I said?
- Earn more sessions by sleeving.

1065
01:31:51,240 --> 01:31:56,473
- What the hell does that mean?
- I do not know, that is why I came out.

1066
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:01,438
Ten...

1067
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:03,393
Nine...

1068
01:32:04,160 --> 01:32:05,752
Eight...

1069
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:07,753
Seven...

1070
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:41,711
Chris came and took all his stuff.

1071
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:07,673
There is a fire somewhere.

1072
01:33:08,640 --> 01:33:10,870
Get into gear.

1073
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:01,593
That is where I put Bossy.

1074
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:07,875
We have got a burner, boys.

1075
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:12,790
Two 2 1 /2 inch lines
from the pump to the fire.

1076
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:16,635
Three 1 1/2 inch lines
from the hydrant to the pump.

1077
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:19,075
If it gets to the station,
the whole town goes.

1078
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:35,191
I want a water curtain with
a full fog pattern on both exposures.

1079
01:34:46,640 --> 01:34:48,790
One, two, three...

1080
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:54,712
We are doing it, C.D.!

1081
01:34:59,480 --> 01:35:01,550
Take it easy, here we go.

1082
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:05,635
Come on, Bossy. Let us go, boy.

1083
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:14,192
You are all
real goddamn fire fighters now.

1084
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:17,760
To all us real goddamn fire fighters.

1085
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:21,115
Thanks to us, no one got fried.

1086
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:24,352
We beat this fire by a nose.

1087
01:35:28,040 --> 01:35:30,634
Well said.

1088
01:35:34,240 --> 01:35:36,708
I want to see you.

1089
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:40,310
A toast.

1090
01:35:41,320 --> 01:35:47,350
I would like to say that I would
rather be with the people of this town -

1091
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:51,911
- than with the finest people
in the world.

1092
01:36:20,040 --> 01:36:22,429
What are friends for?

1093
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:02,798
When I close my eyes
I see you again and again.

1094
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:08,159
Your eyes, your face...
the way you walk.

1095
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:12,829
Your style, your wit...

1096
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:16,880
And your nose, Charlie.

1097
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:21,154
It does not quite work, does it?

1098
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:27,351
I went inside and thought about
why I was attracted to Chris.

1099
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:30,717
It was not the way he looked... Well, -

1100
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:33,348
- at first it was the way he looked.

1101
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:38,719
It was how he made me feel.
He made me feel romantic, -

1102
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:42,756
- intelligent, feminine.

1103
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:48,032
But it was not him who was
doing that to me. It was you.

1104
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:52,318
All these other men have
flat, featureless faces.

1105
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:57,508
No character...
No fire... No nose...

1106
01:37:57,960 --> 01:38:00,520
Charlie, you have a big nose.

1107
01:38:00,680 --> 01:38:05,390
You have a beautiful, great, big,
flesh and bone nose.

1108
01:38:05,560 --> 01:38:08,358
I love your nose.

1109
01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:12,671
I love your nose, Charlie.

1110
01:38:12,920 --> 01:38:15,480
I love you, Charlie.

1111
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:22,716
- Well?
- Are you kidding?

1112
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:29,472
Oh, it is locked. It is locked!

1113
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:32,914
Thank God, I have a key.

1114
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:40,393
- By the way, I named the comet.
- Oh yeah, good old Comet Kowalski.

1115
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:44,872
- No, Comet Charlie.
- That is nice.

1116
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:48,476
Yes, it is my dad's name.

1117
01:40:48,640 --> 01:40:51,438
He'll be so happy.
