I know facts like this because I work for
an insurance company, Consolidated Life.

We're one ofthe top five companies
in the country.

..which is more than the entire population
of, uh... Natchez, Mississippi.

As for myself, I very often stay on at the

..especially when the weather is bad.

It's not that I'm overly ambitious.
It'sjust a way ofkilling time...

You see, I have this little problem
with my apartment.

just halfa block from Central Park.

It used to be $80 until last July...

put in a second-hand air conditioner.

but kind ofcosy. Just right for a bachelor.

I'd be outta here by eight.

- Good evening, Mr Baxter.
- Mrs Lieberman.

- Something's the matter?

dropped my key. Ah, here it is.

Such a racket I heard in your place.

46
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,676
Maybe you had burglars?

Don't worry about that. There's nothing in
here anybody'd wanna steal. Good night.

Mr Kirkeby, you were supposed
to be outta here by eight.

I know, but those things don't always
run on schedule like a Greyhound bus.

I don't mind in the summer,
but on a rainy night...

53

- I haven't had any dinner yet.
- Sure, sure.

I put in a good word for you
with Sheldrake in Personnel.

- That's right.

I told him you're a bright boy.

- Lay in some vodka and vermouth for me.

- I'll pay you on Friday.

cheese crackers you used to have?

- Good evening, Baxter.
- Hi, Doc. Had a late call?

66
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,551
Yeah. Some clown at Schrafft's ate
a club sandwich - including the toothpick.

67
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,080
- Well, good night, Doc.
- Say, Baxter.

68

The way you're beltin' that stuff,
you must have cast-iron kidneys.

That's not me. Just once in a while
I have a few people in for a drink.

As a matter of fact, you must be
an iron man all around.

you're at it every night.

- And sometimes there's a double-header.

- (tuts) A nebbish like you.
- Yeah. Well, I'll see you, Doc.

at the Columbia Medical Center.

147
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,471
- Big mistake, huh?
- No. I sort of like it. (snuffles)

148
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,194
- You got a lulu.
- Yeah. Better not get too close.

149
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,151
- I never catch colds.
- Really?

150
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,999
I was reading some sickness
and accident claims figures.

151
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,557
The average New Yorker aged between
20 and 50 has two and a half colds a year.

152
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,035
- That makes me feel just terrible.
- Why?

153
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,233
If I have no colds a year, some poor slob
must have five colds a year.

154
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,796
- Yeah. It's me.
- You shoulda stayed in bed this morning.

155
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,275
I shoulda stayed in bed last night.

156
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,519
19!

157
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,278
Watch your step.

158
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,868
- And watch your hands, Mr Kirkeby!
- Pardon?

159
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,356
One of these days I'm gonna
shut these doors on you and...

160
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,192
20 next!

161
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:25,469
That Kubelik. Boy, would I like
to get her on a slow elevator to China!

162
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,036
- She's the best operator in the building.
- I'm pretty good myself.

163
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,118
- But she won't give me a date.
- Maybe it's your approach.

164
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,869
A lot of guys around here have tried
all kinds of approaches. No dice.

165
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,993
- What's she trying to prove?
- She could just be a nice respectable girl.

166
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,509
Listen to him! Little Lord Fauntleroy.

167
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,236
(bell)

168
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,634
Hello. Mr Dobisch?
This is Baxter on the 19th floor.

169
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,432
Oh, Buddy-boy!

170
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:17,315
I was just about to call you. I'm sorry
about that mess on the living room wall.

171
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,433
My friend kept insisting Picasso was
a bum, so she started to do that mural.

172
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,915
It's not Picasso I'm calling about.

173
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:28,511
It's the key to my apartment.
You're supposed to leave it under the mat.

174
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,678
But I did. I distinctly
remember putting it there.

175
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,758
Oh, I found the key all right.
Only it's the wrong key!

176
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:40,877
It is? No wonder I couldn't get into
the executive washroom this morning.

177
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,355
And I couldn't get into my apartment!

178
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:47,268
So at 4am I gotta wake up the landlady
and give her a whole song and dance.

179
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,517
That's a shame.
I'll send the key right down.

180
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,517
And about your promotion.

181
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,712
I'll send that efficiency report
to Mr Sheldrake in Personnel.

182
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,195
You may hear from him
before the day's over.

183
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,276
Thank you, Mr Dobisch.

184
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,076
(coughs)

185
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,071
From Mr Dobisch.

186
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,156
Wait.

187
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,356
For Mr Dobisch.

188
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,756
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

189
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,759
(phone rings)

190
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,632
Vanderhof. Public Relations.

191
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,716
Oh, yes, Baxter. Just a minute.

192
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,991
All right, Miss Finch.
Type up what we got so far.

193
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,715
Look, I've got you down for tonight,...

194
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,037
..but I'll be using the place myself,
so I'll have to cancel.

195
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,913
But it's her birthday.
I already ordered the cake.

196
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:27,989
But I am sick. I got a terrible cold and a
fever. I got to go to bed right after work.

197
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,715
If you got a cold, you go to a Turkish bath.
Spend the night. Sweat it out.

198
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,833
That's how you get pneumonia. If I got
pneumonia, I'd be in bed for a month.

199
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:40,192
OK. You made your point. We'll just
have to do it next Wednesday night.

200
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:45,678
- It's the only night I can get away.
- Wednesday, Wednesday... Wednesday.

201
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,435
I got somebody pencilled in.

202
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,313
Let me see what I can do.
I'll get back to you.

203
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,199
- Mr Eichelberger.
- Oh, yes, Baxter. What's your problem?

204
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:12,875
Wednesday is out? Oh, that throws
a little monkey wrench into my agenda.

205
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,151
Thursday? No,
I'm all tied up on Thursday.

206
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,597
Let's schedule that, uh...
meeting for Friday.

207
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,676
Friday.

208
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,199
Let me see what I can do.
I'll get back to you.

209
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:36,350
Premiumwise and billingwise, we are 18
per cent ahead of last year Octoberwise.

210
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,436
(phone rings)

211
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,918
Hello? Yeah, Baxter. What's up?

212
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,157
Instead of Friday, could you
possibly switch to Thursday?

213
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,953
You'd be doing me a great favour.

214
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,715
Let me check. I'll get back to you.

215
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,834
Consolidated Life. I'll connect you.

216
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,837
Sylvia, it's for you.

217
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,678
Yeah?

218
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,392
Oh, hello.

219
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,717
Sure I got home all right.
You owe me 45 cents.

220
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,389
Look, Sylvia. Instead of Friday,
could we make it Thursday night?

221
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:12,549
Thursday?! Well, that's
The Untouchables with Bob Stack!

222
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,836
Bob who?

223
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,829
All right, so we'll watch it
at the apartment. Big deal!

224
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,354
Hello, Baxter? It's OK for Thursday.

225
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,956
Thank you, Mr Kirkeby.

226
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,588
Mr Eichelberger, it's OK for Friday.

227
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,553
Mr Vanderhof? OK for Wednesday.

228
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,871
All right. I'll tell him.

229
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,675
Hey, Baxter, that was Personnel.
Mr Sheldrake's secretary.

230
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:10,555
She's been trying to reach you for the last
20 minutes. They want you upstairs.

231
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:16,076
- Are you getting promoted? Or fired?
- Would you care to make a small wager?

232
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,239
- I've been here twice as long as you but...
- Let's say a dollar?

233
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,873
It's a bet!

234
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,710
- Going up?
- Oh! Excuse me.

235
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:42,676
27, please. Drive carefully. You're carrying
precious cargo. I mean manpowerwise.

236
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,229
27.

237
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:48,148
You may not realise it, but I am
in the top ten, efficiencywise,...

238
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,953
..and this may be the day promotionwise.

239
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,640
You're beginning to sound
like Mr Kirkeby already.

240
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,639
- Why not, as they're kicking me upstairs?
- Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.

241
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,309
You know, you're the only one
who takes his hat off in the elevator.

242
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,635
Something happens to men in elevators.

243
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,638
It's the change of altitude.
The blood rushes to their head.

244
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,832
- I could tell you stories...
- I'd love to hear 'em.

245
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,428
We could have lunch
in the cafeteria sometime.

246
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,437
Or some evening, after work?

247
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,630
- 27.
- Oh.

248
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,320
- I hope everything goes all right.
- I hope so.

249
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,079
They would call me today,
what with my cold.

250
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,555
- How do I look?
- Fine. Wait.

251
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,913
Thank you.

252
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:31,670
I noticed, when you were still on the
local elevator, you always wore a flower.

253
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,189
Good luck. And wipe your nose.

254
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,590
CC Baxter, Ordinary Premium Accounting.
Mr Sheldrake called me.

255
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,393
I called you. That is,
I tried to for 20 minutes.

256
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,476
- I'm sorry.
- Go on in.

257
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,233
- Baxter?
- Yes, sir.

258
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,316
Come in, come in.

259
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,073
I was sort of wondering
what you looked like, Baxter.

260
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,589
- Sit down.
- Yes, Mr Sheldrake.

261
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,679
Been hearing some nice things about you.

262
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,758
Mr Dobisch says you're loyal,
cooperative, resourceful.

263
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:30,078
- Mr Dobisch said that?
- Mr Kirkeby tells me you often work late...

264
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,351
- ..without overtime.
- You know how it is. Things pile up.

265
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:37,510
Mr Vanderhof in Public Relations and
Mr Eichelberger in Mortgage and Loans...

266
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,438
..would both like you
transferred to their departments.

267
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,391
Very flattering.

268
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,513
Tell me, Baxter. Just what is it
that makes you so popular?

269
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,916
- I don't know.
- Think.

270
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,839
- Would you mind repeating the question?
- Look, Baxter. I'm not stupid.

271
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:04,351
I know everything that goes on
in this building every day of the year.

272
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,879
You do?

273
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,357
In 1957 we had an employee here,
name of Fowler. He was very popular too.

274
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,074
It turned out
he was running a bookie joint,...

275
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,590
..tying up our switchboard, using
our IBM machines to figure the odds.

276
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,838
The day before the Kentucky Derby I
called in the vice squad, who raided him.

277
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,916
- The vice squad?
- That's right.

278
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,191
What's that got to do with me?
I'm not running any bookie joint.

279
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,676
- Just what kind of joint are you running?
- Sir?

280
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:34,669
A key is floating around from Kirkeby
to Vanderhof to Eichelberger to Dobisch.

281
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,711
It's the key to a certain apartment.

282
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,116
- Know who that apartment belongs to?
- Who?

283
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,472
Loyal, resourceful, cooperative CC Baxter.

284
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,275
- Oh.
- Are you going to deny it?

285
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,035
No. I'm not going to deny it.
If you'd just let me explain.

286
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,432
You'd better.

287
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,516
Well,...

288
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:02,756
..about a year ago, I was going to night
school, studying advanced accounting.

289
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,670
One of the guys in our department - Iives
in Jersey - had to go to a banquet in town.

290
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:12,032
He needed someplace to change
into a tuxedo, so I gave him the key.

291
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:17,871
Word must've gotten out because all sorts
of guys were suddenly going to banquets.

292
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,676
You give the key to one guy, you can't
say no to another. It all got out of hand.

293
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,836
Baxter, an insurance company
is founded on public trust.

294
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,111
Any employee who conducts himself
in a manner unbecoming...

295
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,152
How many charter members
are there in this little club?

296
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,909
Just those four. Out of a total of 31 ,259.

297
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:42,953
So actually we can be very proud
of our personnel... percentagewise.

298
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:47,551
That's not the point. Four rotten apples
in a barrel, however large the barrel...

299
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,752
- Do you realise if this ever leaked out...
- It won't!

300
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,670
Believe me. Never again. Nobody
is gonna use my apartment from now on.

301
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,360
- Where is your apartment?
- West 67th Street.

302
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:03,759
You have no idea what I go through with
the neighbours, the landlady and the key.

303
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,836
How do you work it with the key?

304
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:10,636
I slip it to 'em in the office and they leave
it under a mat. Never again. I promise.

305
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,716
(intercom buzzer)

306
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,954
- Yes, Miss Olsen?
- Mrs Sheldrake, returning your call. On 2.

307
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,316
(Sheldrake) Yes, dear. Where were you?

308
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:29,676
You had to take Tommy to the dentist?
No cavities? Good. Hold it, dear.

309
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,712
- Where are you going, Baxter?
- I don't wanna intrude.

310
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:36,037
- Since this is straightened out...
- I'm not through with you yet.

311
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,276
I won't be home for dinner tonight.

312
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:42,234
The branch manager from Kansas City
is in town. I'm taking him to the theatre.

313
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,112
Music Man. What else?

314
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,674
No, don't wait up for me,
darling. Goodbye.

315
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,116
Tell me, Baxter.
Have you seen Music Man?

316
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,754
Not yet. I hear it's one swell show.

317
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,030
How would you like to go tonight?

318
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:00,278
You and me? I thought you were taking
the branch manager from Kansas City.

319
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,551
No, I have other plans.
You can have both tickets.

320
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,636
Well... that's very kind of you.

321
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,639
But I'm not feeling well. I've got
this cold. I'm gonna go right home.

322
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,196
Baxter, you're not reading me.
I told you I have plans.

323
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,672
So do l. I'm gonna take
four aspirins, get into bed.

324
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,950
So give the tickets to somebody else.

325
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:23,831
Look, Baxter. I'm not just giving
these tickets. I wanna swap them.

326
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,030
Swap 'em? For what?

327
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,870
It also says here that you are
alert, astute and quite imaginative.

328
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,911
Oh?

329
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,716
Oh...

330
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,719
That's good thinking, Baxter. There's
gonna be a shift in personnel next month.

331
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,549
And as far as I'm concerned,
you are executive material.

332
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,035
- I am?
- Now put down the key.

333
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,036
And put down the address.

334
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,909
It's on the second floor. There's no name
over the door. It just says apartment 2A.

335
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,751
- It's that cold.
- Relax, Baxter.

336
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,836
Yes, thank you, sir.

337
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,758
You will be careful with
the record player? Shh.

338
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,836
Oh, and about the liquor.

339
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:30,351
I ordered some this morning.
I don't know when they'll deliver it.

340
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,272
- This is going to be our little secret.
- Of course.

341
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,960
- You know how people talk.
- Don't worry about that.

342
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:40,675
- Not that I have anything to hide.
- No! Anyway, it's none of my business.

343
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:44,509
Four apples, five apples.
What's the difference?

344
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,596
Percentagewise.

345
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,188
Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice time.

346
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,276
You too, sir.

347
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,788
So I figure, a man in his position,
he'll take me to EI Morocco, maybe 21 .

348
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:30,277
Instead he takes me to Hamburger
Heaven and some schnook's apartment.

349
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,996
- Good night.
- Good night.

350
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,195
Oh! Miss Kubelik?

351
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,357
I've been waiting for you.
I almost didn't recognise you.

352
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,517
This is the first time
I've seen you in civilian clothes.

353
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,835
- How'd it go on the 27th floor?
- Great.

354
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,269
- Look, have you seen The Music Man?
- No.

355
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,958
- Would you like to?
- Sure.

356
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,310
We could get a bite to eat first,
and then go.

357
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,953
- Oh, you mean tonight?
- Yeah.

358
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,038
- I'm sorry, I can't. I'm meeting somebody.
- Oh.

359
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:04,596
- You mean... Iike a girlfriend?
- No. Like a man.

360
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:09,111
I wasn't trying to be personal. The fellas
in the office were wondering if you ever...

361
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,117
You tell 'em now and then.

362
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:15,392
This date, is it... just a date?
Or is it something serious?

363
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,830
Well, it used to be serious.
At least, I was. But he wasn't.

364
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,235
So now the whole thing's
more or less kaput.

365
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,874
- In that case, couldn't you...
- I'm afraid not.

366
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,959
I promised I'd have a drink with him.
He's been calling me all week.

367
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,750
I understand.

368
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:35,237
Well, it was just an idea. I hate
to see a theatre ticket go to waste.

369
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,318
- What time does the show go on?
- 8.30.

370
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,715
Well, I could meet you at the theatre.

371
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:44,753
That's wonderful!
It's the Majestic on 44th Street.

372
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,677
I'll meet you in the lobby.

373
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:50,156
You know, I felt so lousy
this morning. Had 101 fever.

374
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:53,636
Now along comes my promotion
and us - 1 1th row centre.

375
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,637
And you said I should've stayed in bed.

376
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,830
- How is your cold?
- What cold?

377
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:01,839
After the show we could go out
on the town. (hums dance tune)

378
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,633
- I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
- So I see.

379
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,638
There's a great band
at EI Chico, in the Village.

380
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,150
- Around the corner from where you live.
- Sounds good.

381
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:15,717
- How do you know where I live?
- Oh, l... even know who you live with.

382
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,796
Your sister and brother-in-law.

383
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:21,708
I know when you were born and where.
I know all sorts of things about you.

384
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,193
How come?

385
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:27,836
A couple of months ago I looked up
your card in the group insurance file.

386
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:31,714
I know your height and your weight
and your social security number.

387
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,594
You had mumps and measles
and you had your appendix out.

388
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:39,557
Don't mention the appendix
to the fellas in the office.

389
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:44,231
I wouldn't want 'em to get the wrong idea
about how you found out. Bye.

390
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,396
8.30!

391
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,959
(# light music)

392
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,238
(plays "Jealous Lover")

393
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,233
- Good evening, Mr Sheldrake.
- Please, Fran. Not so loud.

394
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,715
Still afraid someone
might see us together?

395
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:46,310
- Let me take your coat.
- No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.

396
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,672
- Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
- It's on the way.

397
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:55,030
- I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
- That's right.

398
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:58,357
- You know I liked it better long.
- I know.

399
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,233
You want a lock to carry in your wallet?

400
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:05,350
- Evening, lady. Nice to see you again.
- Thank you.

401
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,635
How long has it been, Fran? A month?

402
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,320
Six weeks. But who's counting?

403
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,316
I missed you.

404
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,716
Like old times.

405
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,434
Same booth. Same song.

406
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:26,239
- It's been hell.
- Same sauce. Sweet-and-sour.

407
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,752
You don't know what it's like,
next to you in that elevator.

408
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,952
"Good morning, Miss Kubelik."
"Good night, Mr Sheldrake."

409
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,514
I'm still crazy about you, Fran.

410
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:42,919
Let's not start on that again, Jeff. Please?
I'm just beginning to get over it.

411
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,555
I don't believe you.

412
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,598
Look, Jeff. We had two
wonderful months this summer.

413
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,473
But that was it. Happens all the time.

414
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:57,559
Wife and kids go away to the country and
the boss has a fling with his secretary,...

415
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,319
..or the manicurist, or the elevator girl.

416
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:03,716
Come September,
the picnic's over. Goodbye.

417
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:07,719
The kids go back to school,
the boss goes back to the wife,...

418
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,796
..and the girl...

419
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,958
They don't make these shrimp
like they used to.

420
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,560
I never said goodbye, Fran.

421
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:26,194
For a while there, you try kidding yourself
that you're going with an unmarried man.

422
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,993
Then one day he keeps
looking at his watch...

423
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,634
..and asks you if any lipstick's showing,...

424
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,116
..then rushes out to catch
the 7.14 to White Plains.

425
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:39,716
So you fix yourself
a cup of instant coffee...

426
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:43,435
..and you sit there
by yourself and you think,...

427
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,551
..and it all begins to look so... ugly.

428
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:54,595
How do you think I felt
riding home on that 7.14 train?

429
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,759
Why do you keep calling me, Jeff?
What do you want from me?

430
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,836
I want you back, Fran.

431
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,714
Sorry, Mr Sheldrake. I'm full up.
You'll have to take the next elevator.

432
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:08,594
You're not giving me a chance, Fran.
I have something to tell you.

433
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,429
- Go ahead. Tell me.
- Not here. Can't we go someplace else?

434
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,279
- No. I have a date at 8.30.
- Oh?

435
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:19,315
- Important?
- Not very, but I'm gonna be there anyway.

436
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,000
- You ready order dinner now?
- No. No dinner.

437
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,509
Just bring us two more drinks, will you?

438
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,353
(coughs)

439
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,393
Fran, do you remember
that last weekend we had?

440
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:51,196
Do l! That leaky boat you rented, and me
in a black negligee and a life preserver.

441
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,595
Do you remember what we talked about?

442
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:57,190
- We talked about a lot of things.
- I mean about my getting a divorce.

443
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,595
We didn't talk about it, Jeff. You did.

444
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,676
You didn't believe me, did you?

445
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:06,078
They got it on a long-playing record now.
"Music to String Her Along By."

446
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:10,830
"My wife doesn't understand me. You're
the best thing that ever happened to me."

447
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,157
- That's enough, Fran.
- "Trust me, baby. We'll work it out."

448
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,874
- You're not being funny.
- I wasn't trying.

449
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:21,234
- Fran, just listen to me for a minute.
- All right. I'm sorry.

450
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:26,229
I saw my lawyer this morning. I wanted
his advice about the best way to handle it.

451
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,715
- Handle what?
- What do you think?

452
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:34,432
Let's get something straight, Jeff.
I never asked you to leave your wife.

453
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,199
Of course not. You had
nothing to do with it.

454
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,156
Are you sure that's what you want?

455
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,630
I'm sure... if you'll just tell me
that you still love me.

456
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,676
You know I do.

457
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,278
Fran.

458
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,677
(woman laughs)

459
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,756
Jeff, darling...

460
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,878
It is getting crowded. Let's get out of here.

461
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,758
(pianist plays "Jealous Lover")

462
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,439
Taxi!

463
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,996
- Jeff, I have that date, remember?
- But I love you, remember?

464
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,634
- (whistles)
- Where are we going?

465
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,433
- Not back to that leaky boat?
- I promise.

466
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,155
51 West 67th.

467
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,396
Congratulations.

468
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,038
Would you mind? CC Baxter - that's me.

469
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,356
Thank you.

470
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,869
(door opens)

471
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,356
(Kirkeby) Hi, Buddy-boy.
Congratulations and all that jazz.

472
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,836
- Hi, fellas.
- Well, you made it, just like we promised.

473
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:29,032
Quite an office.
Name on the door, rug on the floor.

474
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:33,676
Teamwork: that's what counts in this
organisation. All for one and one for all.

475
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,756
- Know what I mean?
- I have a vague idea.

476
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,917
Baxter, we're a little disappointed
in you, gratitudewise.

477
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,350
- Oh, I'm very grateful.
- Then why are you locking us out?

478
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:47,873
Well, it's been sort of rough the past few
weeks, what with my cold and... Iike that.

479
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,719
We went to bat for you.
Now you won't play ball with us.

480
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:54,992
After all, it's my apartment. It's
private property, not a public playground.

481
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:59,193
So you got yourself a girl. That's OK
with us. But not every night in the week!

482
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,992
How selfish can you get?

483
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:04,749
Last week I had to use my nephew's car
and take Sylvia to a drive-in in Jersey.

484
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,792
I'm too old for that sort of thing -
I mean in a Volkswagen.

485
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,037
I sympathise with you.
Believe me, I'm very sorry.

486
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:14,357
- You'll be a lot sorrier.
- Are you threatening me?

487
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,438
Listen, Baxter. We made you
and we can break you.

488
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,438
- Good morning, Mr Sheldrake.
- Good morning, gentlemen.

489
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:25,519
- Baxter, do you like your office?
- Yes, sir. I wanna thank you very much.

490
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:28,438
Don't thank me.
Your friends here recommended you.

491
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,189
- We just dropped by to wish him luck.
- We know you won't let us down.

492
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:36,871
So long, fellas. Drop in any time.
The door is always open... to my office.

493
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,711
I like the way you handled that, Baxter.

494
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,308
- How does it feel to be an executive?
- Oh, fine.

495
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:46,115
- I'll work hard to justify your confidence.
- I'm sure you will.

496
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:50,836
About the apartment. Now that you've got
a raise, can't we afford a second key?

497
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,269
- I guess so.
- You know my secretary, Miss Olsen?

498
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:56,073
- Oh, yeah. Is she the lucky girl that...?
- Oh, no, no.

499
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:01,274
I just meant that she's kind of a busybody,
and passing that key back and forth...

500
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,914
- Why take chances?
- You can't be too careful.

501
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,952
Oh, l... have something
I think belongs to you.

502
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,514
- Me?
- I mean the young lady, whoever she is.

503
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:12,279
- I found it when I got back last night.
- Oh. Thanks.

504
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,756
The mirror is broken.
It was broken when I found it.

505
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,119
- Yeah. She threw it at me.
- Sir?

506
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,629
You know how it is.
They always give you a bad time.

507
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:23,795
Yeah, I know how it is.

508
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:28,471
You see a girl every week for laughs and
they think you're gonna divorce your wife.

509
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:31,672
- Now I ask you, is that fair?
- No, sir. It's very unfair.

510
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,711
- Especially to your wife.
- Yeah.

511
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:38,511
You know, Baxter, I envy you. A bachelor,
all the dames you want, no complications.

512
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,153
That's the life all right.

513
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,475
- Put me down for Thursday again.
- Roger.

514
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,750
And I'll get that other key.

515
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:00,189
- Merry Christmas. I'll connect you.
- Merry Christmas. Consolidated Life.

516
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,231
Merry Christmas. I'm ringing.

517
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:04,316
Yeah? Yeah?!

518
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,509
Where?

519
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:06,834
You bet!

520
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:11,112
Somebody watch my line. There's
a swingin' party on the 19th floor!

521
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:16,238
# Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh

522
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:19,955
# Hey! Jingle bells,
jingle bells, jingle all the way

523
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:23,231
# Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh

524
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,316
(singing continues)

525
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:43,919
So I said to him "Never again. Either you
get yourself a bigger car or a smaller girl."

526
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,716
Miss Kubelik? Miss...

527
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,076
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.

528
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,158
- I thought you were avoiding me.
- What gave you that idea?

529
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:55,909
In six weeks you've only been in my
elevator once, and you kept on your hat.

530
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:59,350
As a matter of fact, I was rather hurt
that night you stood me up.

531
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,436
I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.

532
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,118
- I forgive you.
- You shouldn't.

533
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:06,596
You couldn't help it. You can't
suddenly walk out on one man...

534
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,870
..because you have a date
with another man.

535
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,275
- You did the decent thing.
- Don't be too sure.

536
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,756
Just because I wear a uniform,
that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.

537
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:19,431
A second administrative assistant has
to be a pretty good judge of character.

538
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,949
And as far as I'm concerned, you're tops.

539
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:26,596
I mean decencywise and... otherwisewise.

540
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,676
Cheers.

541
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,590
- One more.
- I shouldn't drink while driving.

542
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:37,635
You're so right. By the power vested
in me, I declare this elevator out of order.

543
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,035
Shall we join the natives?

544
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:43,550
- Why not? They seem friendly enough.
- Don't you believe it.

545
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:47,639
There'll be human sacrifices. White-collar
workers tossed into computers...

546
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,910
..and punched full of little square holes.

547
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:52,156
- How many drinks did you have?
- Three!

548
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:55,352
- I thought so.
- Wait. I hear the sound of running water.

549
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,948
- I'll be right back!
- I'll be right here.

550
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:00,952
(slurring) Hi!

551
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,594
How's the branch manager
from Kansas City?

552
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,358
- I beg your pardon?
- I'm Miss Olsen.

553
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:07,357
Mr Sheldrake's secretary.

554
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:09,755
So you don't have to
play innocent with me.

555
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:13,759
He used to tell his wife
I was the branch manager from Seattle...

556
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:17,953
..four years ago when we were having
a little ring-a-ding-ding.

557
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,839
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Before me it was Miss Rossi in Auditing.

558
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,520
And after me it was
Miss Koch in Disability.

559
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,915
And right before you was a Miss, um...

560
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,315
Oh, what's her name? On the 25th floor.

561
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:33,876
- Would you excuse me?
- What for? You haven't done anything.

562
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:37,072
It's him. Oh, what a salesman!

563
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,915
Always the last booth
in the Chinese restaurant...

564
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:42,998
..and the same pitch
about divorcing his wife.

565
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:49,318
Then, in the end, you wind up
with egg foo yung on your face.

566
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,396
Miss Kubelik!

567
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,118
Well, thank you, Miss Olsen.

568
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:59,199
Always happy to do a little something
for our girls in uniform.

569
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,430
Are you all right? What's the matter?

570
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:05,028
Nothing. There are just
too many people here.

571
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:08,948
Why don't we step into my office? There's
something I want your opinion about.

572
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:13,676
I have my own office now. I'm the second
youngest executive in this company.

573
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:17,349
The only one younger is a grandson
of the chairman of the board.

574
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,516
(whistles) Do you mind?

575
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:27,916
Miss Kubelik, I would like
your honest opinion.

576
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:31,191
I've had this under my desk
for a week. It cost me $1 5.

577
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:34,471
I haven't been able
to get up enough nerve to wear it.

578
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:44,675
It's what they call the Junior Executive
model. What do you think?

579
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:50,793
I guess I made a boo-boo, huh?

580
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:53,070
- I like it.
- Really?

581
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,998
You wouldn't be ashamed to be seen
with somebody in this hat?

582
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:59,954
- Of course not.
- Maybe if I wore it a little to one side.

583
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:02,719
- Is that better?
- Much better.

584
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:05,434
Since you wouldn't be

- I understand. Christmas and family.

Get you a promotion.

595

- Would you like to be an elevator starter?
- Too many girls have seniority over me.

596
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:50,518
No problem. Why don't we
discuss it over the holidays?

597
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:54,872
I could call you, pick you up, have
a big unveiling. Am I wearing this right?

- Yes, I know.

Well, that's a little more like it.
At least you're speaking to me.

659
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:56,870
A funny thing happened to me
at the office party today.

660
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,355
I ran into your secretary, Miss Olsen.

661
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,276
You know. Ring-a-ding-ding?

662
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:06,073
And I laughed so much, I like to died.

663
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:10,637
Is that what's been bothering you, Fran?
Miss Olsen? That's ancient history.

664
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:13,718
Well, I never was very good at history.

665
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,473
Let me see. There was Miss Olsen,
and then there was Miss Rossi.

666
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:21,592
No, she came before.
Miss Koch came after Miss Olsen.

667
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:24,029
- Now, Fran...
- And just think.

668
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:27,869
Right now some lucky girl in the building
is gonna come after me.

669
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,639
OK. OK, Fran. I guess I deserved that.

670
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:34,719
But ask yourself: why does a man
run around with a lot of girls?

671
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:38,469
Because he's unhappy at home.
Because he's lonely. That's why.

672
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:41,717
But that was before you, Fran.
I've stopped running.

673
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:47,159
How could I be so stupid?
You'd think I would've learned by now.

674
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:51,637
When you're in love with a married man,
you shouldn't wear mascara.

Oh. Our friend at the Chinese restaurant.

Oh, I have a present for you.

680
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:21,118
I didn't know what to get you. Besides,
it's kind of awkward for me shopping, so...

681
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:24,596
Here's $100. You go
and buy yourself something.

682

OK. I just thought,
as long as it was paid for...

686
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:58,596
Don't ever talk like that, Fran.

687
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:02,679
- Don't make yourself out to be cheap.
- $100? I don't call that cheap.

688
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:06,759
And you must be paying somebody
something for the use of the apartment.

Stop it, Fran.

(# Latin-beat dance music)

736
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:01,676
(hums along)

737
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,555
All right, Miss Kubelik. Get up.

738
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:54,436
Come on. It's past checking-out time.

739
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:58,758
The management would appreciate it
if you'd get the hell outta here.

740
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:06,560
I used to like you. I used to like you a lot.
Well, it's all over between us, so beat it.

741
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:09,156
O-u-T, out!

742
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:12,236
Come on, wake up.

743
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:20,476
Oh my God.

744
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:22,556
Miss Kubelik?

745
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:25,196
Miss Kubelik?

746
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:37,398
I broke a nail tryin' to get the tray out.

747
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:40,478
You oughta buy yourself
a new refrigerator.

748
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:44,552
I didn't mean right now!

749
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:49,396
Dr Dreyfuss.

750
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:51,916
Doc!

751
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:56,759
There's a girl in my place, took
some sleeping pills. I can't wake her up.

752
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,836
- Let me get my bag.
- Hurry up!

753
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:04,150
Hey, over here, lover.
What's all the running around about?

754
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:06,840
You're gonna wear yourself out.

755
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:10,108
- Not so rough, honey!
- Good night.

756
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,196
- Good night?!
- The party's over.

757
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:14,436
What? Did I do somethin' wrong?

758
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:17,757
It's an emergency.
I'll see you some other time.

759
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:19,836
Not this one. In there, Doc.

760
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:24,395
- What's goin' on here, anyway?
- Will you please just get out?!

761
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:25,999
My shoes!

762
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:28,998
Some lover you are! Some sexpot!

763
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:31,759
Here. Find a phone.
Call your husband in Havana.

764
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:37,113
You bet I will! And when I tell him how
you treated me, he'll push your face in!

765
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:39,196
You fink!

766
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:56,076
Is she gonna be all right, Doc?

767
01:05:56,200 --> 01:06:00,079
- How many pills were in that bottle?
- It was half-full. About a dozen.

768
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:03,078
- Do you have to take her to the hospital?
- Help me, will you?

769
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,760
- Into the bathroom.
- What are you gonna do?

770
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:08,553
Get that stuff out of her stomach
if it isn't too late.

771
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:11,240
You'd better put some coffee on,
and pray.

772
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:41,796
(Fran vomits and coughs)

773
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,876
Bring my bag.

774
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:17,276
Roll up her right sleeve.

775
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:28,636
Hold that.

776
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:37,316
Nice veins.

777
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:51,319
Wanna tell me what happened?

778
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:54,000
I don't know. I mean, I wasn't even here.

779
01:07:56,920 --> 01:08:00,549
You see, we had... some words earlier.

780
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:04,639
It was nothin' serious.
You might call it a lovers' quarrel.

781
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:08,398
So you went right out
and picked yourself up another dame.

782
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:13,116
- Something like that.
- You know, Baxter, you're a real cutie pie.

783
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:14,719
Yes, you are.

784
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:27,475
If you'd come home half an hour later,
you'd have had quite a Christmas present.

785
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,956
(kettle whistles)

786
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:47,476
Get the coffee.

787
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:51,076
(Fran moans)

788
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:12,839
Let's get some air in here.
Open the windows.

789
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:17,796
(Fran coughs)

790
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:29,476
What's her name?

791
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:32,194
Miss Kubelik. Fran.

792
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:40,468
Fran, I'm a doctor. I'm here because
you took too many sleeping pills.

793
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:42,716
Do you understand what I'm saying?

794
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:44,273
(Fran moans)

795
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:47,710
Fran, I'm Dr Dreyfuss.
I'm here to help you.

796
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:50,638
You took all those sleeping pills.
Remember?

797
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:55,270
- Sleeping pills.
- That's right, Fran. And I'm a doctor.

798
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:58,799
- Doctor?
- Dr Dreyfuss.

799
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:02,713
Dreyfuss.

800
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:04,796
Get more coffee.

801
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:08,035
Now tell me again. What's my name?

802
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:13,395
Dr... Dreyfuss.

803
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:15,476
And what happened to you?

804
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:17,678
I...

805
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:19,756
I took sleeping pills.

806
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:22,675
Do you know where you are?

807
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:27,751
- No.
- Yes, you do, Fran. Now concentrate!

808
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,556
I don't know.

809
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:34,396
Do you know who that is?

810
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:42,836
Look at him.

811
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:46,633
Mr Baxter. 19th floor.

812
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:49,276
Hello, Miss Kubelik.

813
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:52,154
Mr? Miss? Such politeness!

814
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:57,234
We work in the same building.
We try to keep it quiet.

815
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:01,400
What are you doing here?

816
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:06,515
Don't you remember
we were together at the office party?

817
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:08,949
Oh, yes. The office party.

818
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:11,548
- Miss Olsen.
- That's right.

819
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:14,513
I told you we had a fight.
That was what it was about.

820
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:17,837
Miss Olsen. That girl
that was here earlier.

821
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:21,954
I don't understand.

822
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:27,234
The main thing is I got here in time and
you're gonna be all right. Isn't she, Doc?

823
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:30,315
I'm so tired.

824
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:32,396
Come on. Drink this.

825
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:35,354
Please... just let me sleep.

826
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:39,109
No, you can't sleep! Fran, open your eyes!

827
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:41,716
Let's get her walking.

828
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:48,717
We've got to keep her awake for the next
few hours. Now come on, Fran, walk!

829
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:51,308
One, two, three, four!

830
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:53,635
One, two, three, four!

831
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:55,876
Left, right, left, right,...

832
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,150
..left, right and return!

833
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:01,352
And... one, two, three, four!

834
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:04,756
Now you've got it! One, two, three, four!

835
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:07,997
Walk, Fran! One, two, three, four!

836
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:10,680
One, two... And return again.

837
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:13,792
And... Ieft, right, left, right.

838
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:23,917
She'll sleep on and off
for the next 24 hours.

839
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:27,589
Of course, she'll have
a dandy hangover when she wakes up.

840
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:29,676
Just as long as she's OK.

841
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:35,079
These cases are harder on the doctor than
the patient. I oughta charge by the mile.

842
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:38,158
- Any of that coffee left?
- Yeah, sure.

843
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:41,475
How do you spell her last name?

844
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,989
Kubelik. Two k's.

845
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:46,076
What's her address?

846
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,756
Where does she live?

847
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:52,075
Why do you wanna know, Doc?

848
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:56,157
- You don't have to report this, do you?
- It's regulations.

849
01:12:56,280 --> 01:13:01,070
But it was an accident. She had too much
to drink, didn't know what she was doing.

850
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:03,270
There was no suicide note or anything.

851
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:06,392
- I'm not thinkin' about myself.
- Aren't you?

852
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:09,876
She's got a family,
and there's the people at the office.

853
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,754
Can't you forget you're a doctor,
just say you're here as a neighbour?

854
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:16,633
Well, as a doctor, I can't prove
it wasn't an accident.

855
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:19,832
But as your neighbour,
I'd like to kick you around the block.

856
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:22,394
- Mind if I cool this off?
- Help yourself.

857
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:24,829
I don't know what you did to that girl,...

858
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:27,394
..but it was bound to happen,
the way you carry on.

859
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:29,875
Live now, pay later. Diners Club!

860
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:34,593
Why don't you grow up, Baxter?
Be a mensch.

861
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:37,029
- You know what that means?
- I'm not sure.

862
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:39,116
A mensch! A human being!

863
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:42,992
So you got off easy this time.
So you were lucky.

864
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:47,591
But you're not out of the woods yet,
because most of 'em try it again.

865
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:51,068
Well, you know where I am
if you need me.

866
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:02,793
Mr Baxter! Open up already.

867
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:07,831
Oh.

868
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:11,236
- Mrs Lieberman.
- Who did you think it was? Kriss Kringle?

869
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:13,396
What was going on here last night?

870
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:16,751
- Last night?
- All that marching! Tramp, tramp, tramp!

871
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:20,156
- Army manoeuvres maybe?
- I'll never invite those people again.

872
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:24,319
What you get from renting to bachelors.
All night I didn't sleep ten minutes.

873
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:29,719
- And I'm sure you woke up Dr Dreyfuss.
- Don't worry. He was out on a case.

874
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:34,755
I'm warning you, Mr Baxter. This is
a respectable house, not a honky-tonky.

875
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:36,836
Come on, Oscar.

876
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:07,191
Operator, I want White Plains,
New York. Mr JD Sheldrake.

877
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:09,276
Make that person-to-person.

878
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:16,792
Five, four, three, two, one...

879
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:19,388
- Let her rip!
- (phone rings)

880
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:21,078
I'll get the phone.

881
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:24,033
Hey, Dad, why don't we
put a fly in the nose cone?

882
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:26,958
- See if we can bring it back alive.
- That's a thought.

883
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:30,993
Maybe we should put in two flies
and see if they'll propagate in orbit.

884
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:35,113
- See if they'll what?
- Propagate. You know. Multiply.

885
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:38,789
- Baby flies?
- Oh. Oh!

886
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:42,068
- It's for you, Dad.
- Thanks, Jeff.

887
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:45,272
A Mr Baxter. Person-to-person.

888
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:47,914
Come on. Help me round up some flies.

889
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:52,591
- Hello? What's on your mind, Baxter?
- Something came up that's important.

890
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:56,156
I think you should see me
at the apartment as soon as possible.

891
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:59,875
- What's this all about?
- I didn't wanna tell you over the phone.

892
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:04,915
But that certain party... You know
who I mean. I found her here last night.

893
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:08,032
- She took an overdose of sleeping pills.
- What?!

894
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:13,194
- What is it, Jeff? Who's on the phone?
- One of our employees had an accident.

895
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:16,596
I don't know why they bother me
with these things on Christmas Day.

896
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:18,472
Yes, Baxter.

897
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:20,556
Just how serious is it?

898
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:24,195
It was touch and go there for a while,
but she's sleeping it off now.

899
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:27,198
I thought maybe you'd like to
be here when she wakes up.

900
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:32,518
That's impossible. You'll have to
handle the situation yourself, Baxter.

901
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:36,872
- As a matter of fact, I'm counting on you.
- Yes, sir. I understand.

902
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:41,198
She left a letter. Would you like me
to open it and read it to you?

903
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:43,959
Well, it was just a suggestion.

904
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:47,834
No, don't worry. I kept your name
out of it, so there'll be no trouble,...

905
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:50,315
..policewise or newspaperwise.

906
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:55,718
You see, the doctor is a friend of mine,
so we were very lucky in that respect.

907
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:58,195
Actually, he thinks she's my girl.

908
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:01,190
No, he just jumped to the conclusion.

909
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:04,039
Around here I'm known as
quite a ladies' man.

910
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:08,233
Of course, we're not out of the woods yet.
Sometimes they try it again.

911
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:12,114
Yes, sir. I'll do my best. It'll take her
a couple of days to fully recover...

912
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:15,391
..and I may have a little problem
with the landlady.

913
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:19,390
OK, Mr Sheldrake. I'll keep her
in the apartment as long as I can.

914
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:22,910
Isn't there some sort of message
you want me to give her?

915
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:25,476
Well, I'll... think of something.

916
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:28,076
Yes, sir. Goodbye, Mr Sheldrake.

917
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:32,796
I'm sorry.

918
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:36,990
- I'm sorry, Mr Baxter.
- What are you doing out of bed?

919
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:40,192
I didn't know. I had no idea
this was your apartment.

920
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:42,914
Here. Let me help you.

921
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:45,356
Oh, I'm so ashamed.

922
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:47,436
Why didn't you just let me die?

923
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:52,918
What kind of talk is that? You got
a little overemotional, but you're fine now.

924
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:54,439
Oh!

925
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:58,712
Oh, my head! It feels just like
a big wad of chewing gum.

926
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:01,479
- What time is it?
- Two o'clock.

927
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:03,750
Oh, my dress. I have to go home.

928
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:06,235
You're in no shape
to go anywhere but back to bed.

929
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:08,749
- You don't want me here.
- Sure I do. I...

930
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:11,872
It's always nice
to have company for Christmas.

931
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,390
- I'm stronger than you are.
- I just wanna brush my teeth.

932
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:18,910
Oh. Of course. I think I can find
a new toothbrush somewhere.

933
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:21,600
Here. Put that on.

934
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:52,715
- How about some breakfast?
- No. I don't want anything.

935
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:54,796
I'll fix you some coffee.

936
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:59,072
Oh! We're all out of coffee.
You had quite a lot last night.

937
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:01,156
Back in a minute.

938
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:12,430
Mrs Dreyfuss,
could I borrow some coffee?

939
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:16,189
- And an orange and a couple of eggs?
- Eggs, he asks me for! Oranges!

940
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:20,632
What you need is a good horsewhipping!
From me the doctor has no secrets.

941
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:22,910
Poor girl. How could you do such a thing?

942
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:25,873
I didn't do anything. Honest. It's just...

943
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:31,999
You take a girl out just for laughs and
she thinks you're serious marriagewise.

944
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:35,476
Big shot! For you, I wouldn't lift a finger!

945
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:38,558
But for her, I'll fix a little something to eat.

946
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:48,432
Who are you calling?

947
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:50,596
My sister, to tell her
what happened to me.

948
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:55,475
Wait a minute! Let's talk it over first.
Just what are you gonna tell her?

949
01:20:56,240 --> 01:21:00,028
- I haven't figured it out exactly.
- Well, you'd better figure it out exactly.

950
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:03,118
Suppose she asks you why
you didn't come home last night.

951
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:05,117
I'll say I spent the night with a friend.

952
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:07,196
- Who?
- Someone from the office.

953
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:09,072
- Where are you now?
- In his apartment.

954
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:11,475
- In his apartment?
- In her apartment.

955
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:13,716
- What's your friend's name?
- Baxter.

956
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:16,798
- What's her first name?
- Miss.

957
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:19,639
- When are you comin' home?
- As soon as I can walk.

958
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:21,716
- Your legs hurt?
- No, my stomach.

959
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:24,513
- Your stomach?
- They had to pump it out!

960
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:29,350
You shouldn't call anybody. Not till you
get the chewing gum out of your head.

961
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:32,517
They'll be worried about me.
They might call the police.

962
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:35,712
We have to be careful.
We don't wanna involve anybody.

963
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:38,798
After all, Mr Sheldrake's a married man.

964
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:41,556
Thanks for reminding me(!)

965
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:47,156
I didn't mean it that way.

966
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:51,239
I was just talking to him on the phone.
He's very concerned about you.

967
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:53,999
He doesn't give a damn about me.

968
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:57,715
- You're wrong. He told me...
- He's a liar.

969
01:21:57,840 --> 01:21:59,990
But that's not the worst part.

970
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:02,395
The worst part is I still love him.

971
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:05,236
(doorbell)

972
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:08,396
Oh. That must be Mrs Dreyfuss.

973
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:11,830
Remember the doctor from last night?
That's his wife.

974
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:15,436
So where's the victim?

975
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:18,396
Max the Knife!

976
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:24,993
- Nu, little lady, how are we feeling today?
- I don't know. Kind of dizzy.

977
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:30,274
The best thing for dizzy is noodle soup
with chicken white meat and a glass tea.

978
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:34,678
- No, thank you. I'm really not hungry.
- Go ahead, eat. Enjoy.

979
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:37,598
You wouldn't have such a thing
as a napkin, would you?

980
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:40,792
- I have some paper towels.
- Beatnik.

981
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:44,276
In my kitchen, third drawer,
under the good silver, are napkins.

982
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:45,719
Yes, Mrs Dreyfuss.

983
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:48,354
So, what are you waiting for?
A singing commercial?

984
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:50,436
- I can't eat.
- You must eat.

985
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:53,597
And you must get healthy
and you must forget him.

986
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:56,871
Such a fine boy he seemed
when he first moved in here.

987
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,878
Clean and cut, a regular lvy Leaguer.

988
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:04,278
Turns out he's King Farouk,
with the drinking, with the cha-cha.

989
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:06,356
With the no napkins.

990
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:10,359
A girl like you, for the rest of your life
you wanna cry in your noodle soup?

991
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:12,948
Who needs it? Now you listen to me.

992
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:17,073
You'll find yourself a nice,
substantial man - a widower, maybe -

993
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:20,715
and settle down, instead of
noshing all those sleeping pills.

994
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:23,877
For what? For whom?
For some good-time Charlie?

995
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,831
- (door opens)
- Shh.

996
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:29,839
One napkin comin' up. Wish we had
some champagne to wrap it around.

997
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:32,997
- What did I tell you?
- Mrs Dreyfuss, you don't have to wait.

998
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:36,908
- I'll wash the dishes.
- You'd break 'em. I'll come back for them.

999
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:39,429
If he makes trouble, give me a yell.

1000
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:44,395
- She doesn't seem to like you very much.
- Oh, I don't mind.

1001
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:46,988
As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered.

1002
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:52,069
That anybody'd think a girl like you would
do a thing like this over a guy like me.

1003
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:56,198
Did you find something here?
An envelope?

1004
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:57,833
Yes. I've got it.

1005
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:02,158
Don't you think we'd better destroy it
so it won't fall in the wrong hands?

1006
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:04,236
Open it.

1007
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:10,228
There's nothing here but a $100 bill.

1008
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:13,591
That's right. Will you see
that Mr Sheldrake gets it?

1009
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:16,676
Sure.

1010
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:20,076
Take this away, will you?

1011
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:23,513
Would you like me to move
the television set in here?

1012
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:26,279
- You play gin rummy?
- I'm not very good at it.

1013
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:30,234
- I am. Let me get the cards.
- You don't have to entertain me.

1014
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:33,955
There's nothing I'd like better.
You know. Togetherness.

1015
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:38,596
Guess what I did last Christmas. Had
dinner at the automat, went to the zoo,...

1016
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:41,393
..then came home and cleaned up
after Mr Eichelberger.

1017
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:43,795
He had a little eggnog party here.

1018
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:46,115
So I'm way ahead this year.

1019
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:48,879
Three across. Spades double?

1020
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,956
High deals.

1021
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:53,556
Six? Eight.

1022
01:25:01,240 --> 01:25:03,993
I think I'm gonna give it all up.

1023
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:06,872
Give what up?

1024
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:12,678
Why do people have to
love people, anyway?

1025
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:15,996
I know what you mean.

1026
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:21,076
Queen.

1027
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:26,075
- I don't want it.
- Pick a card.

1028
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:34,918
What do you call it when somebody keeps
gettin' smashed up in car accidents?

1029
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:38,191
- Bad insurance risk?
- That's me with men.

1030
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:44,396
I was jinxed from the word go. First time
I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.

1031
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:46,556
A cemetery?

1032
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:49,319
I was 1 5. We used to go there to smoke.

1033
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:53,399
His name was George and
he threw me over for a drum majorette.

1034
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:56,756
uh, gin.

1035
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:05,114
That's 10, 20... 36.
And 25 makes 61 and two boxes.

1036
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:07,231
I have this talent for falling in love...

1037
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:10,670
..with the wrong guy
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

1038
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:13,470
Well, how many guys were there?

1039
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:16,392
Three.

1040
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:20,308
The last one was the manager of a finance
company back home in Pittsburgh.

1041
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:22,396
They found a shortage in his accounts.

1042
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:26,115
He asked me to wait for him.
He'll be out in 1965.

1043
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:29,556
Cut.

1044
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:35,069
So I came to New York and moved in with
my sister and her husband, a cab driver.

1045
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:39,876
They sent me to secretarial school and
then I applied for a job at Consolidated.

1046
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,116
But I flunked the typing test.

1047
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:44,913
- Too slow?
- No. I can type up a storm.

1048
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:46,996
I just can't spell.

1049
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:52,869
So they gave me a pair of white gloves
and stuck me in an elevator.

1050
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,355
And that's how I met Jeff.

1051
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:59,080
Oh God, I'm so fouled up.

1052
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:01,509
What am I gonna do now?

1053
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:05,756
Better win a hand. You're on a blitz.

1054
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:10,073
Was he very upset when you told him?

1055
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:12,156
Mr Sheldrake? Yeah, very.

1056
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:16,949
Maybe he does love me, only he doesn't
have the nerve to tell his wife.

1057
01:27:17,080 --> 01:27:18,479
I'm sure that's it.

1058
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:21,831
- You really think so?
- No doubt about it.

1059
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:25,395
Would you hand me that pad and pencil?

1060
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:28,432
- What for?
- I'm gonna write to Mrs Sheldrake.

1061
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:30,790
- You what?
- As one woman to another.

1062
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:34,708
- I'm sure she'll understand.
- I don't think that's a very good idea.

1063
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:38,116
- Why not?
- For one thing, you can't spell.

1064
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:42,199
Secondly, if you did something
like that, you'd hate yourself.

1065
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:45,880
I don't like myself very much anyway.

1066
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:50,069
Pick up the cards. Let's go.

1067
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:53,158
- Do I have to?
- You bet. I got a terrific hand.

1068
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:02,393
- You really wanna discard that?
- Sure.

1069
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:04,272
Gin.

1070
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:08,313
(hums nervously)

1071
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:13,195
10, 20, 40, 52 and 25... 77.

1072
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:17,230
Spades are double... 1 54.

1073
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:24,156
Blitzed. Two games.

1074
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:25,076
(Sylvia hums along to dance music)

1075
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:44,636
(doorbell)

1076
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:53,791
- (doorbell)
- All right, all right, Mrs Dreyfuss.

1077
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,752
- Hi, Baxter.
- What do you want?

1078
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:04,836
What do I want? Just a minute.

1079
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:07,520
- You can't come in!
- What's the matter with you?

1080
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:09,631
I made a reservation for four o'clock.

1081
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:11,990
You can't stay.
Take your champagne and go.

1082
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:15,510
I don't wanna pull rank on you,
but I told the little lady it was all set.

1083
01:30:15,640 --> 01:30:19,189
Are you gonna leave, Mr Kirkeby,
or do I have to throw you out?

1084
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:22,759
(sniggers) Buddy-boy,
why didn't you say so?

1085
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:26,111
- Got yourself a little playmate, huh?
- Now will you get out?

1086
01:30:26,240 --> 01:30:28,196
(Sylvia hums dance music)

1087
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:34,751
Hey, come on! What are we waiting for?
Open up, will you?

1088
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:36,836
(Dr Dreyfuss) Mildred!

1089
01:30:38,360 --> 01:30:42,638
- What's holding things up?
- Say, let's have a party, the four of us.

1090
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:44,716
No!

1091
01:30:48,760 --> 01:30:50,990
(sniggers) Well, I don't blame you.

1092
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:53,998
So you hit the jackpot, eh, kid?
I mean Kubelikwise.

1093
01:30:54,120 --> 01:30:56,475
Don't worry.
I won't say a word to anybody.

1094
01:30:56,840 --> 01:30:58,796
Stay with it, Buddy-boy.

1095
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:15,236
Who was that?

1096
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:19,276
Just somebody delivering
a bottle of champagne. Like some?

1097
01:31:20,120 --> 01:31:22,680
Would you mind opening that window?

1098
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:30,480
- Now don't get any ideas, Miss Kubelik.
- I just want some fresh air.

1099
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:33,831
It's only one storey down.
The best you could do is break a leg.

1100
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:36,554
So they'll shoot me, like a horse.

1101
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:40,111
Please, you gotta promise me
you won't do anything foolish.

1102
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:42,595
- Who'd care?
- I would.

1103
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:51,874
Why can't I ever fall in love
with somebody nice like you?

1104
01:31:52,760 --> 01:31:54,716
Yeah. Well...

1105
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:58,193
That's the way it crumbles, cookiewise.

1106
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:01,875
Go to sleep.

1107
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:39,191
- (women) Good morning, Mr Sheldrake.
- Miss Olsen, come into my office, please.

1108
01:32:48,240 --> 01:32:52,028
- Did you have a nice Christmas?
- Lovely. You were a great help(!)

1109
01:32:52,160 --> 01:32:54,720
Your pep talk to Miss Kubelik
at the office party.

1110
01:32:54,840 --> 01:32:59,277
- Sorry, Jeff. I never could hold my liquor.
- I thought you could hold your tongue.

1111
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:01,834
- It won't happen again.
- You bet it won't.

1112
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:04,793
I'll arrange for you to get
a month's severance pay.

1113
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:07,798
That's right, Miss Olsen.
I'm letting you go.

1114
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:10,988
You let me go four years ago, Jeff.

1115
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:15,352
And were cruel enough to make me sit out
there and watch the new models pass by.

1116
01:33:15,480 --> 01:33:18,517
I'd appreciate it if you'd be
out of here as soon as you can.

1117
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:20,596
Yes, Mr Sheldrake.

1118
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:33,079
Operator, this is Mr Sheldrake. I'd like
Mr Baxter's home telephone number.

1119
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:35,953
He's in Ordinary Premium Accounting.

1120
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:54,156
- (Baxter) Hello?
- Hello. Jeff Sheldrake. Can you talk?

1121
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:56,632
Yes. She's in the shower.

1122
01:33:56,760 --> 01:33:59,354
- She's coming along fine, considering.
- Good.

1123
01:33:59,480 --> 01:34:02,995
- Is there anything you need? Money?
- No, thank you, Mr Sheldrake.

1124
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:06,157
As a matter of fact, I have
some money for you. $100.

1125
01:34:06,280 --> 01:34:07,633
Oh.

1126
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:11,435
- If there's anything I can do for you...
- For me? I don't think so.

1127
01:34:11,560 --> 01:34:14,199
But I was hoping maybe
you could do something for her.

1128
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:17,711
Like what? Put yourself
in my place, Baxter.

1129
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:19,956
How can I help her? My hands are tied.

1130
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:23,555
Well... at least you can talk to her.

1131
01:34:24,640 --> 01:34:28,076
Let me put her on. And please, be gentle.

1132
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:31,149
There's a call for you!

1133
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:33,635
- For me?
- Yeah. Mr Sheldrake.

1134
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:37,476
I don't wanna talk to him.

1135
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:39,477
I think you should.

1136
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:44,720
I gotta run down to the grocery anyway.
There's nothing left here but frozen pizza.

1137
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:47,476
I'll be right back. OK?

1138
01:35:07,120 --> 01:35:09,076
Hello, Jeff.

1139
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:13,517
- Yes, I'm all right.
- Why did you do it, Fran?

1140
01:35:13,640 --> 01:35:16,029
It's so childish,
and it never solves anything.

1141
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:18,720
I oughta be very angry with you,
scaring me that way.

1142
01:35:18,840 --> 01:35:23,436
But let's forget the whole thing, pretend
it never happened. What do you say?

1143
01:35:23,560 --> 01:35:25,516
Fran?

1144
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:28,394
Are you there, Fran?

1145
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:34,152
Of course I'm not here, because
the whole thing never happened.

1146
01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:37,989
I never took those pills,
I never loved you,...

1147
01:35:38,120 --> 01:35:40,270
..we never even met.

1148
01:35:41,400 --> 01:35:45,279
- Isn't that the way you want it, Jeff?
- You know I didn't mean it that way.

1149
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:48,119
You just get well.
Do what the nurse says. I mean Baxter.

1150
01:35:48,240 --> 01:35:51,198
I'll see you as soon as I can.
Goodbye, Fran.

1151
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:11,268
Hello, Mrs Sheldrake. This is Miss Olsen.

1152
01:36:11,400 --> 01:36:15,393
Fine, thank you. I was wondering
if we could have lunch together.

1153
01:36:16,240 --> 01:36:19,789
I don't know how important it is,
but you might find it educational.

1154
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:22,514
It concerns your husband.

1155
01:36:22,640 --> 01:36:26,189
All right. One o'clock,
Longchamps, Madison and 59th.

1156
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:34,390
Don't worry. I'm on my way.

1157
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:36,476
Just making a personal call.

1158
01:36:38,120 --> 01:36:40,076
Here's a dime.

1159
01:36:42,760 --> 01:36:44,239
Going down.

1160
01:36:56,120 --> 01:36:58,634
Oh, Mr Baxter! I'm glad you're here.

1161
01:36:58,760 --> 01:37:01,274
- I was just going to get the passkey.
- What for?

1162
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:04,119
I thought I smelled gas
coming from your apartment.

1163
01:37:04,240 --> 01:37:06,196
Gas?!

1164
01:37:14,920 --> 01:37:16,876
Miss Kubelik?

1165
01:37:18,680 --> 01:37:20,636
Miss Kubelik!

1166
01:37:23,240 --> 01:37:25,196
- You all right?
- Sure!

1167
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:29,117
- What's that funny smell?
- Gas! Didn't you turn it on?

1168
01:37:29,240 --> 01:37:32,118
Yes, to boil water to get
the coffee stains out of my dress.

1169
01:37:32,240 --> 01:37:35,516
- You turned it on but you didn't light it.
- Are you supposed to?

1170
01:37:35,640 --> 01:37:39,315
In this house you're supposed to.
Hey, what are you doing with that?

1171
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:42,750
I was washing my stockings,
so I thought I'd wash your socks too.

1172
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:46,873
- Oh. Thank you.
- Very curious. I could only find 3/ pair.

1173
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,389
Things are a little disorganised
around here.

1174
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:53,229
I'd say. What's a tennis racket
doing in the kitchen?

1175
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:58,070
Tennis racket? Oh, I remember.
I was cooking myself an ltalian dinner.

1176
01:37:58,200 --> 01:38:00,839
I used it to strain the spaghetti.

1177
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:03,428
- Why not?
- In fact, I'm a pretty good cook.

1178
01:38:03,560 --> 01:38:06,233
- Only I'm a lousy housekeeper.
- Yes, you are.

1179
01:38:06,360 --> 01:38:10,592
When I was straightening up the couch,
I found six hairpins, a lipstick,...

1180
01:38:10,720 --> 01:38:14,235
..a pair of false eyelashes and
a swizzle stick from the Stork Club.

1181
01:38:14,360 --> 01:38:17,557
It's just that I'm the kind of guy
who can't say no.

1182
01:38:17,680 --> 01:38:21,593
- I don't mean to girls. I mean...
- To someone like Mr Sheldrake.

1183
01:38:21,720 --> 01:38:24,678
- I guess so.
- I know so.

1184
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:28,675
- He's a taker.
- What?

1185
01:38:29,240 --> 01:38:31,390
Some people take, some people get took.

1186
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:35,399
And they know they're gettin' took
and there's nothin' they can do about it.

1187
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:37,476
I wouldn't say that.

1188
01:38:38,200 --> 01:38:40,156
What would you like for dinner, huh?

1189
01:38:40,280 --> 01:38:43,352
Hey. Onion soup, and canned asparagus...

1190
01:38:43,480 --> 01:38:45,436
I really should be getting home.

1191
01:38:45,560 --> 01:38:48,438
- My family'll be flipping by now.
- You can't leave yet.

1192
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:52,758
The doctor said it takes 48 hours
to get that stuff out of your system.

1193
01:38:53,800 --> 01:38:57,918
How long does it take to get someone
you're stuck on out of your system?

1194
01:38:58,040 --> 01:39:00,873
If only they'd invent
some kind of pump for that.

1195
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:06,393
I know how you feel, Miss Kubelik. You
think it's the end of the world. But it's not.

1196
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:08,988
I went through exactly
the same thing myself.

1197
01:39:09,120 --> 01:39:10,997
- You did?
- Well, not exactly the same.

1198
01:39:11,120 --> 01:39:12,792
I tried to do it with a gun.

1199
01:39:12,920 --> 01:39:15,912
- Over a girl?
- Worse. It was the wife of my best friend.

1200
01:39:16,040 --> 01:39:20,875
And I was mad about her. But I knew
it was hopeless and I decided to end it all.

1201
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:24,959
I went to a pawnshop and I bought a .45
automatic and I drove up to Eden Park...

1202
01:39:25,080 --> 01:39:27,116
- Do you know Cincinnati?
- No, I don't.

1203
01:39:27,240 --> 01:39:29,800
Anyway, I parked the car
and I loaded that gun...

1204
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:34,118
You read in the papers that people shoot
themselves. Believe me, it's not that easy.

1205
01:39:34,240 --> 01:39:37,710
I mean, how do you do it?
Here? Here? Here?

1206
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:41,600
- Know where I finally shot myself?
- Where?

1207
01:39:41,720 --> 01:39:43,551
- Here.
- In the knee?!

1208
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:46,114
Yeah! I was sittin' there, tryin' to decide.

1209
01:39:46,240 --> 01:39:48,515
A cop came up because
I was illegally parked.

1210
01:39:48,640 --> 01:39:51,871
I tried to hide the gun
under the seat and it went off.

1211
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:55,515
- That's terrible!
- It was a year till I could bend the knee.

1212
01:39:55,640 --> 01:39:58,632
But I got over the girl in three weeks.

1213
01:40:00,120 --> 01:40:03,749
Still lives in Cincinnati.
Has four kids and gained 20 pounds.

1214
01:40:03,880 --> 01:40:06,189
Sends me a fruitcake every Christmas.

1215
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:08,675
Are you just making this up
to make me feel better?

1216
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:10,756
Of course not! Here's the fruitcake.

1217
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:12,996
- Do you wanna see my knee?
- No, thank you.

1218
01:40:13,120 --> 01:40:16,271
The fellas in the office might
get the wrong idea how I found out.

1219
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:20,359
Let 'em! Look, I'm gonna cook dinner
for us. We'll have fruitcake for dessert.

1220
01:40:20,480 --> 01:40:23,597
You just sit there and rest.
You've done enough for today.

1221
01:40:23,720 --> 01:40:26,837
- Yes, Nurse.
- (Baxter hums opera music)

1222
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:43,517
- Can I help you?
- I'm lookin' for Miss Kubelik.

1223
01:40:43,640 --> 01:40:48,634
- So am l. She didn't report this morning.
- She didn't? Who's in charge here?

1224
01:40:48,760 --> 01:40:52,958
That comes under General Office
Administration. Mr Dobisch, 21st floor.

1225
01:40:53,080 --> 01:40:54,752
Thanks.

1226
01:40:57,160 --> 01:41:01,472
So I take Sylvia up to the apartment, and
guess who he's stashed in the bedroom.

1227
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:02,828
- Who?
- Kubelik.

1228
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:05,952
No kiddin'? Buddy-boy and Kubelik
having a little toot?

1229
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:10,392
Toot? More like a lost weekend.
Neither of 'em showed up for work today.

1230
01:41:10,520 --> 01:41:12,112
AWOL, hm?

1231
01:41:12,240 --> 01:41:14,708
What gripes me is
they guzzled my champagne...

1232
01:41:14,840 --> 01:41:18,230
..while Sylvia and I wound up
at the Guggenheim Museum.

1233
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:21,796
- Mr Dobisch?
- Yeah.

1234
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:26,839
I'm Karl Matuschka. My sister-in-law
runs one of the elevators. Fran Kubelik.

1235
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:28,393
- Miss Kubelik?
- You know her?

1236
01:41:28,520 --> 01:41:32,229
Of course. We have a lot of employees,
but we're one big, happy family.

1237
01:41:32,360 --> 01:41:37,275
She lives with us, and my wife's nervous
cos Fran hasn't been home for two days.

1238
01:41:37,400 --> 01:41:38,719
That so?

1239
01:41:38,840 --> 01:41:41,798
So we wondered if somebody here
knew what happened to her.

1240
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:43,319
I see.

1241
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:46,910
What do you think, Al?
Can we help the man?

1242
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:50,316
Why not? We don't owe
Buddy-boy anything.

1243
01:41:50,440 --> 01:41:53,796
Yeah. What's Buddy-boy
done for us lately?

1244
01:41:55,880 --> 01:41:58,155
Who is Buddy-boy?

1245
01:41:59,400 --> 01:42:01,356
(hums opera music)

1246
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:25,069
- Are we dressing for dinner?
- No. Just come as you are.

1247
01:42:25,200 --> 01:42:29,159
- You're pretty good with that racket.
- You should see my backhand.

1248
01:42:31,120 --> 01:42:33,998
Wait till you see me serve the meatballs.

1249
01:42:34,120 --> 01:42:38,033
- Shall I light the candles?
- It's a must, gracious livingwise.

1250
01:42:38,160 --> 01:42:40,116
(hums opera music)

1251
01:42:41,120 --> 01:42:42,473
# Meatball

1252
01:42:42,600 --> 01:42:44,556
(hums)

1253
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:47,638
# Meatball

1254
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:49,716
(Baxter continues humming)

1255
01:42:56,320 --> 01:42:59,198
- You bought some napkins.
- Might as well go all the way.

1256
01:42:59,320 --> 01:43:01,276
(Baxter hums)

1257
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:04,789
You know, I used to live
like Robinson Crusoe.

1258
01:43:04,920 --> 01:43:07,070
Shipwrecked, among eight million people.

1259
01:43:07,200 --> 01:43:10,237
And then one day I saw
a footprint in the sand...

1260
01:43:10,360 --> 01:43:12,316
..and there you were.

1261
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:15,350
It's a wonderful thing, dinner for two.

1262
01:43:15,480 --> 01:43:19,189
- Do you usually eat alone?
- No. Sometimes I eat with Ed Sullivan.

1263
01:43:19,320 --> 01:43:22,039
Or sometimes Dinah Shore
or Perry Como.

1264
01:43:22,160 --> 01:43:25,994
The other night it was Mae West.
She was much younger then. Cheers.

1265
01:43:26,120 --> 01:43:28,839
- Cheers.
- Know what we're gonna do after dinner?

1266
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:30,991
- The dishes.
- I mean after that.

1267
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:33,315
- What?
- You don't have to if you don't want to.

1268
01:43:33,440 --> 01:43:35,749
- Oh, I don't?
- We're gonna finish the gin game.

1269
01:43:35,880 --> 01:43:38,440
- So keep a clear head.
- (doorbell)

1270
01:43:39,240 --> 01:43:43,119
Cos I don't wanna take advantage of you,
the way I did yesterday in bed.

1271
01:43:43,240 --> 01:43:45,276
- Baxter?
- Yes.

1272
01:43:54,040 --> 01:43:56,634
What's with you, Fran?
Did you forget where you live?

1273
01:43:56,760 --> 01:44:00,309
- My brother-in-law, Karl Matuschka.
- Oh! How do you do, Mr Matusch...

1274
01:44:00,440 --> 01:44:04,672
- Get dressed. I got the cab downstairs.
- Wait. I know what you're thinking, but...

1275
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:07,473
It's none of my business
what you do. You're over 21 .

1276
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:11,070
- But your sister thinks you're a lady.
- All we were gonna do was eat!

1277
01:44:11,200 --> 01:44:13,589
If there wasn't a lady present,
I'd clobber you.

1278
01:44:13,720 --> 01:44:16,473
All right, Karl! I'll get dressed.

1279
01:44:25,320 --> 01:44:27,276
Want a martini?

1280
01:44:31,120 --> 01:44:34,829
How about some spaghetti
with meat sauce that I cooked myself?

1281
01:44:40,120 --> 01:44:42,793
Your sister-in-law sure is terrific.

1282
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:50,277
It must be murder drivin' a cab
in New York with the cross-town traffic.

1283
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:52,356
(door opens)

1284
01:44:54,560 --> 01:44:56,516
Hi, Baxter. How's the patient?

1285
01:44:56,640 --> 01:44:58,551
Oh, uh... I'm fine, Doc.

1286
01:44:58,680 --> 01:45:00,636
Not you. Miss Kubelik.

1287
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:06,115
- What's the matter with Miss Kubelik?
- This is Mr Matuschka. He's... got a cab.

1288
01:45:06,240 --> 01:45:08,595
- Fran been sick?
- No. Just a little accident.

1289
01:45:08,720 --> 01:45:12,508
- What does he mean, accident?
- Well... these things happen all the time.

1290
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:14,710
What things? What kind
of a doctor are you?

1291
01:45:14,840 --> 01:45:17,912
Not that kind! He just gave her
a shot, pumped out her stomach.

1292
01:45:18,040 --> 01:45:21,112
- What for?
- I took sleeping pills. But I'm fine now.

1293
01:45:21,240 --> 01:45:23,708
- Why'd you take sleeping pills?
- On account of me.

1294
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:25,796
You?

1295
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:27,638
Who else?

1296
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:34,276
Leave him alone!

1297
01:45:36,560 --> 01:45:39,711
Oh, you fool. You damn fool.

1298
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:44,718
- (Karl) Come on, Fran.
- Goodbye, Mr Baxter.

1299
01:45:50,440 --> 01:45:52,396
Goodbye, Doctor.

1300
01:45:54,240 --> 01:45:58,791
Well, I don't wanna gloat, but
just between us, you had it coming to you.

1301
01:45:59,480 --> 01:46:00,879
(tuts)

1302
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,798
You're gonna have a shiner tomorrow.

1303
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:05,672
Let me get my bag.

1304
01:46:07,720 --> 01:46:09,676
Don't bother, Doc.

1305
01:46:09,800 --> 01:46:11,756
It doesn't hurt a bit.

1306
01:46:32,680 --> 01:46:34,910
Mr Sheldrake's office? This is CC Baxter.

1307
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:38,157
Please tell him I'd like to
come up and see him. It's important.

1308
01:46:38,280 --> 01:46:40,236
Will you call me back, please?

1309
01:46:42,920 --> 01:46:45,832
Mr Sheldrake, I've got good news for you.

1310
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:48,956
All your troubles are over.

1311
01:46:50,120 --> 01:46:52,839
I'm gonna take Miss Kubelik
off your hands.

1312
01:46:53,640 --> 01:46:55,995
The plain fact is, I love her.

1313
01:46:56,880 --> 01:46:59,348
I thought you should be the first to know.

1314
01:46:59,480 --> 01:47:02,278
After all, you don't really
want her, and I do.

1315
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:06,359
And though it may sound presumptuous,
she needs somebody like me.

1316
01:47:06,480 --> 01:47:09,790
- So I think it would be best all around.
- (phone rings)

1317
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:11,319
Solutionwise.

1318
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:12,668
Yes?

1319
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:14,870
I'll be right up.

1320
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:18,231
Mr Sheldrake, I've got good news for you.

1321
01:47:18,360 --> 01:47:20,316
All your troubles are over.

1322
01:47:24,440 --> 01:47:26,590
19.

1323
01:47:26,720 --> 01:47:30,269
- Hi, Buddy-boy. What happened to you?
- Hit by a swinging door?

1324
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:33,198
- Or a yellow cab?
- That guy really must've belted him.

1325
01:47:33,320 --> 01:47:36,392
Yeah. He's punchy. Talking to himself.

1326
01:47:36,640 --> 01:47:37,959
27.

1327
01:47:38,080 --> 01:47:40,435
Those two days
she spent in the apartment...

1328
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:43,438
..made me realise
how lonely I'd been before.

1329
01:47:43,560 --> 01:47:46,950
But, thanks to you, I'm
in a financial position to marry her.

1330
01:47:47,080 --> 01:47:49,992
If I can ever square things with her family.

1331
01:47:50,120 --> 01:47:52,429
Good morning. CC Baxter.

1332
01:47:54,080 --> 01:47:56,116
(intercom buzzer)

1333
01:47:56,240 --> 01:47:58,196
- Mr Baxter is here.
- Send him in.

1334
01:48:00,360 --> 01:48:03,158
Mr Sheldrake, I've got good news for you.

1335
01:48:03,280 --> 01:48:05,316
And I've got good news for you, Baxter.

1336
01:48:05,440 --> 01:48:07,635
- All your troubles are over.
- Sir?

1337
01:48:07,960 --> 01:48:11,032
I know how worried you were
about Miss Kubelik. Stop worrying.

1338
01:48:11,160 --> 01:48:13,913
I'm going to take her off your hands.

1339
01:48:14,040 --> 01:48:16,838
- You're gonna take her off my hands?
- That's right.

1340
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:19,315
I've moved out of the house.

1341
01:48:20,240 --> 01:48:23,118
I'm gonna be staying in town,
at the Athletic Club.

1342
01:48:23,240 --> 01:48:26,118
- You left your wife.
- If you must know, I fired my secretary.

1343
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:30,870
My secretary got to my wife, and my wife
fired me. Ain't that a kick in the head?

1344
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:32,479
Yeah.

1345
01:48:32,600 --> 01:48:34,431
Now what's your news, Baxter?

1346
01:48:36,520 --> 01:48:40,115
It's about Miss Kubelik. She's feeling
all right again so she went home.

1347
01:48:40,240 --> 01:48:43,198
Swell. And don't think
I've forgotten what you did for me.

1348
01:48:43,320 --> 01:48:45,276
This way, Baxter.

1349
01:48:48,560 --> 01:48:50,835
Sit down. Try it on for size.

1350
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:54,274
- You like? It's all yours.
- Mine?

1351
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:59,394
My assistant has been shifted to the
Denver office and you're taking his place.

1352
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:01,875
What's the matter?
You don't seem very excited.

1353
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:06,073
Well, it's just that so many things
have been happening so fast.

1354
01:49:06,200 --> 01:49:08,873
I'm very pleased.
Especially for Miss Kubelik.

1355
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:13,790
I think she's the kind of girl that definitely
ought to be married to... someone.

1356
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:19,199
Sure, sure. But first the property has to be
settled. Then it takes six weeks in Reno.

1357
01:49:19,320 --> 01:49:22,118
Meanwhile I'm going to enjoy
being a bachelor for a while.

1358
01:49:22,240 --> 01:49:25,550
Oh, Baxter, you now can have lunch
in the executive dining room.

1359
01:49:25,680 --> 01:49:28,240
That's one of the privileges
that goes with this job.

1360
01:49:28,360 --> 01:49:32,797
You also get a nice little expense account,
use of the executive washroom...

1361
01:49:32,920 --> 01:49:35,229
Say, what happened to you, Baxter?

1362
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:37,954
- I got kicked in the head too.
- Oh?

1363
01:49:58,200 --> 01:50:00,236
Good evening, Mr Baxter.

1364
01:50:00,360 --> 01:50:01,793
Oh.

1365
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:04,593
Miss Kubelik. How are you feeling?

1366
01:50:04,720 --> 01:50:07,314
- I feel fine. How's your eye?
- Oh, fine.

1367
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:10,159
- How are things at the apartment?
- Nothing's changed.

1368
01:50:10,280 --> 01:50:13,113
- We never did finish that gin game.
- I know.

1369
01:50:14,760 --> 01:50:17,035
I suppose you heard about Mr Sheldrake.

1370
01:50:17,160 --> 01:50:19,628
Leaving his wife? Yeah.
I'm very happy for you.

1371
01:50:19,760 --> 01:50:22,228
- I never thought he'd do it.
- I told you all along.

1372
01:50:22,360 --> 01:50:25,750
- You were wrong about Mr Sheldrake.
- I guess so.

1373
01:50:25,880 --> 01:50:27,836
You were wrong about me too.

1374
01:50:27,960 --> 01:50:30,997
What you said about those who take
and those who get took.

1375
01:50:31,120 --> 01:50:34,192
Mr Sheldrake wasn't using me.
I was using him. See?

1376
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:38,632
Last month I was at desk 861 on
the 19th floor. Now I'm on the 27th floor.

1377
01:50:38,760 --> 01:50:40,716
A panelled office, three windows.

1378
01:50:40,840 --> 01:50:43,752
So it all worked out fine.
We're both getting what we wanted.

1379
01:50:43,880 --> 01:50:46,678
Yes. Will you walk me to the subway?

1380
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:52,238
No, thank you. Well, l... To tell you the
truth, I have this heavy date for tonight.

1381
01:50:55,600 --> 01:50:58,831
- Aren't you meeting Mr Sheldrake?
- No. You know how people talk.

1382
01:50:58,960 --> 01:51:04,034
I decided it was best not to see each other
until everything was settled, divorcewise.

1383
01:51:04,160 --> 01:51:06,116
That's very wise.

1384
01:51:07,200 --> 01:51:09,555
- Good night, Mr Baxter.
- Good night.

1385
01:51:44,120 --> 01:51:47,351
- Baxter, could you step in here a minute?
- Yes, Mr Sheldrake.

1386
01:51:47,480 --> 01:51:49,436
- There you are.
- Much obliged.

1387
01:51:51,240 --> 01:51:56,837
Here are the figures on staff turnover. 37%
of females leave to get married and 22%...

1388
01:51:56,960 --> 01:51:59,793
Baxter, you work too hard.
It's New Year's Eve. Relax!

1389
01:51:59,920 --> 01:52:02,798
- Yes, sir.
- I suppose you'll be celebrating tonight.

1390
01:52:02,920 --> 01:52:04,956
- Naturally.
- I'm taking Miss Kubelik out.

1391
01:52:05,120 --> 01:52:07,111
- I finally talked her into it.
- I see.

1392
01:52:07,240 --> 01:52:11,438
The only thing is, I'm staying at the
Athletic Club and it's strictly stag, so...

1393
01:52:11,560 --> 01:52:13,596
If you don't mind?

1394
01:52:14,360 --> 01:52:17,750
- Don't mind what?
- You know my key to your apartment?

1395
01:52:17,880 --> 01:52:20,997
When we had that little scare
about Miss Kubelik,...

1396
01:52:21,120 --> 01:52:24,954
- ..l threw it out the window of the train.
- Very clever.

1397
01:52:25,080 --> 01:52:27,275
So now I'll have to borrow your key.

1398
01:52:28,720 --> 01:52:31,439
- Sorry, Mr Sheldrake.
- What do you mean, sorry?

1399
01:52:31,560 --> 01:52:33,869
You're not bringing anybody
to my apartment.

1400
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:38,198
- It's not just anybody. It's Miss Kubelik.
- Especially not Miss Kubelik.

1401
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:41,392
- How's that again?
- No key.

1402
01:52:43,200 --> 01:52:47,637
Baxter, I picked you for my team because
I thought you were a bright young man.

1403
01:52:47,760 --> 01:52:51,070
Do you realise what you're doing?
Not to me, but to yourself?

1404
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:54,431
Normally it takes years
to work your way up to the 27th floor.

1405
01:52:54,560 --> 01:52:57,472
But it only takes 30 seconds
to be out on the street again.

1406
01:52:57,600 --> 01:53:00,068
- You dig?
- I dig.

1407
01:53:01,200 --> 01:53:03,156
So what's it going to be?

1408
01:53:09,680 --> 01:53:12,638
- Now you're being bright.
- Thank you, sir.

1409
01:53:29,360 --> 01:53:31,954
- Baxter, you gave me the wrong key.
- No, I didn't.

1410
01:53:32,080 --> 01:53:34,640
But this is the key
to the executive washroom.

1411
01:53:34,760 --> 01:53:38,389
That's right. I won't be needing it
because I'm all washed up around here.

1412
01:53:38,520 --> 01:53:41,796
- What's gotten into you?
- Just following doctor's orders.

1413
01:53:41,920 --> 01:53:45,993
I've decided to become a mensch.
Know what that means? A human being.

1414
01:53:46,120 --> 01:53:49,908
- Now hold on, Baxter.
- The old payola won't work any more.

1415
01:53:50,040 --> 01:53:51,996
Goodbye, Mr Sheldrake.

1416
01:54:20,440 --> 01:54:22,396
(doorbell)

1417
01:54:26,160 --> 01:54:29,948
- We're having a party and ran out of ice.
- Sure, Doc.

1418
01:54:30,080 --> 01:54:32,116
How come you're alone
on New Year's Eve?

1419
01:54:32,240 --> 01:54:34,117
Well, I got things to do.

1420
01:54:34,240 --> 01:54:38,279
- What's this? You're packing?
- Yeah. I'm giving up the apartment.

1421
01:54:38,400 --> 01:54:40,197
Where are you moving to?

1422
01:54:40,320 --> 01:54:43,232
I don't know. All I know is
I gotta get outta this place.

1423
01:54:43,360 --> 01:54:45,316
Sorry to lose you, Baxter.

1424
01:54:45,440 --> 01:54:49,991
Me? Oh, my body. Don't worry, it'll go to
the university, Doc. I'll put it in writing.

1425
01:54:50,120 --> 01:54:53,192
- Could you use some champagne?
- Booze we don't need.

1426
01:54:53,320 --> 01:54:55,072
Say, why don't you join us?

1427
01:54:55,200 --> 01:54:59,990
We got two brain surgeons, a proctologist
and three nurses from Bellevue.

1428
01:55:00,120 --> 01:55:01,997
No, thanks. I don't feel like it.

1429
01:55:02,120 --> 01:55:06,193
In case I don't see you again, how much
do I owe you for taking care of that girl?

1430
01:55:06,320 --> 01:55:10,029
Forget it. I didn't do it as a doctor.
I did it as a neighbour.

1431
01:55:10,160 --> 01:55:12,720
By the way, whatever happened to her?

1432
01:55:13,960 --> 01:55:16,838
You know me with girls.
Easy come, easy go.

1433
01:55:16,960 --> 01:55:19,520
- Goodbye, Doc.
- Happy New Year.

1434
01:55:48,520 --> 01:55:49,794
(lively music and chatter)

1435
01:56:01,080 --> 01:56:03,435
Sorry I took so long
on the phone. We're all set.

1436
01:56:03,560 --> 01:56:05,869
- For what?
- I rented a car. It'll be here at one.

1437
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,753
- We're driving to Atlantic City.
- Atlantic City?

1438
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:13,237
I know it's a drag, but you can't find
a hotel room in town on New Year's Eve.

1439
01:56:14,240 --> 01:56:16,993
Ring out the old year, ring in the new.

1440
01:56:17,120 --> 01:56:19,236
Ring-a-ding-ding.

1441
01:56:19,720 --> 01:56:22,951
I didn't plan it this way. It's Baxter's fault.

1442
01:56:23,080 --> 01:56:24,035
Baxter?

1443
01:56:24,160 --> 01:56:27,550
He wouldn't give me
the key to the apartment.

1444
01:56:27,680 --> 01:56:30,148
- He wouldn't?
- No. He just walked out on me. Quit.

1445
01:56:30,280 --> 01:56:33,192
Threw that big, fat job right in my face.

1446
01:56:34,560 --> 01:56:38,473
- The nerve.
- The little punk. After all I did for him.

1447
01:56:38,600 --> 01:56:42,798
Said I couldn't bring anybody to the
apartment, especially not Miss Kubelik.

1448
01:56:42,920 --> 01:56:45,593
What's he got against you, anyway?

1449
01:56:45,720 --> 01:56:51,352
I don't know. I guess that's the way
it crumbles, cookiewise.

1450
01:56:53,320 --> 01:56:55,675
What are you talking about?

1451
01:56:56,640 --> 01:56:59,916
I'd spell it out for you, only I can't spell.

1452
01:57:04,720 --> 01:57:09,589
(all) # Should auld acquaintance be forgot

1453
01:57:09,720 --> 01:57:14,430
# And never brought to mind...

1454
01:57:15,720 --> 01:57:17,676
Happy New Year, Fran.

1455
01:57:19,680 --> 01:57:23,878
# And days of auld lang syne

1456
01:57:24,720 --> 01:57:29,669
# For auld lang syne, my dear

1457
01:57:29,800 --> 01:57:34,635
# For auld lang syne

1458
01:57:34,760 --> 01:57:39,709
# We'll drink a cup of kindness yet

1459
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:45,278
# For auld lang syne

1460
01:57:45,720 --> 01:57:47,676
(cheering)

1461
01:57:50,680 --> 01:57:52,636
(horns and whistles)

1462
01:57:56,560 --> 01:57:58,516
Fran?

1463
01:57:59,760 --> 01:58:01,716
Where are you, Fran?

1464
01:58:16,840 --> 01:58:18,990
(bang)

1465
01:58:19,120 --> 01:58:21,076
Mr Baxter!

1466
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:22,475
Mr Baxter!

1467
01:58:22,840 --> 01:58:25,718
Mr Baxter! Mr Baxter!

1468
01:58:28,600 --> 01:58:29,874
Oh!

1469
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,992
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

1470
01:58:33,120 --> 01:58:35,475
Are you sure? How's your knee?

1471
01:58:36,200 --> 01:58:38,156
I'm fine all over.

1472
01:58:40,120 --> 01:58:43,396
- Mind if I come in?
- Of course not.

1473
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:48,956
Let me get another glass.

1474
01:58:51,800 --> 01:58:53,836
- Where are you going?
- Who knows?

1475
01:58:53,960 --> 01:58:57,157
Another neighbourhood,
another town, another job.

1476
01:58:57,280 --> 01:58:59,510
I'm on my own.

1477
01:58:59,640 --> 01:59:01,596
That's funny. So am l.

1478
01:59:02,760 --> 01:59:04,955
What'd you do with the cards?

1479
01:59:05,080 --> 01:59:07,036
In there.

1480
01:59:17,920 --> 01:59:19,876
What about Mr Sheldrake?

1481
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,958
I'm gonna send him
a fruitcake every Christmas.

1482
01:59:25,320 --> 01:59:27,276
Cut.

1483
01:59:28,880 --> 01:59:30,836
I love you, Miss Kubelik.

1484
01:59:31,360 --> 01:59:33,112
Three.

1485
01:59:33,240 --> 01:59:34,389
Queen.

1486
01:59:34,520 --> 01:59:38,354
Did you hear what I said, Miss Kubelik?
I absolutely adore you.

1487
01:59:40,920 --> 01:59:42,876
Shut up and deal.

1488
01:59:57,240 --> 02:00:00,198
