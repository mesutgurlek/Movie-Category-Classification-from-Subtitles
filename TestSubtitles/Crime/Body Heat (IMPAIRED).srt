He showed it to me.

He was trying to prove
how much he loved me or something.

How did he get so fat?

MATTY:

He doesn't tell me much,
but I've picked up a little.

327

- I know they own a lot of land
along shore. - Who's "they"?

MATTY: He's never introduced me to anyone.
I'm not sure if they're all legitimate.

329
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:58,225
NED: I wonder what they call themselves.
Maybe I've heard of them.

MATTY: I know they own that old place
near Miranda Beach, The Breakers.

The Breakers? I thought Morrie Fisher

00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:44,227
We're always looking for opportunities.

469
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,479
We're willing to take
an occasional risk...

470
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:49,816
...if the downside isn't too steep,
if the conditions are right.

471

But this guy,
he hadn't done his homework.

472
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:57,448
He didn't know the bottom line.
That's how I knew he was full of shit.

473
00:42:57,658 --> 00:43:01,160
Gotta know the bottom line.
That's all that counts.

They wanna get rich,
they wanna do it quick.

They wanna be there with one score.

You mean, do the groundwork? Earn it?

I couldn't call.

I was afraid to. I was afraid
you wouldn't let me come.

That's right.
You mustn't call. Never call.

Ned, I hated it.

I hated sitting there with the two of you.
I thought I'd scream.

505
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:33,646
You called my apartment from the house.

506

That's good. Be very careful now
about the phones.

- We can account for some calls.

We've had some contact.
It'd make sense.

Why, Ned? What's happened?

513
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:55,376
Because we're gonna kill him.

It's the only way we can have
everything we want.

518

...for no reason but we want him dead.

520
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,920
He doesn't deserve it.
Let's not ever say that.

We're doing it for us.

522

You'll inherit half of everything he owns.
That's what the will says, right?

523
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:50,890
That's it, then.

- It's real, all right.

528
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:09,659
And if we're not careful,
it's gonna be the last real thing we do.

529
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:34,952
Her mother works plenty hard
to keep Heather on Edmund's mind.

530
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,662
Always bringing her around...

531
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:39,832
...always reporting
on everything she does in school.

532
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,335
That Roz is a smart one.

533
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:46,672
And, you know, anything Heather inherits
goes to Roz. Heather won't even get a look.

534
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:50,927
That's the part I can't stand, what seems
so wrong, that half of it should go to her.

535
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:53,721
That's the way it is.
There's nothing we can do about it.

Are you sure?

537
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:59,060
I was thinking that maybe there is.

538
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:03,022
The will is with Edmund's lawyer
in Miami. I know that.

539
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:06,901
What if I could get him to bring it home?

540
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:10,738
And couldn't we rewrite it? Change it?

541
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:14,700
Every little change
would mean a lot for us, Ned.

542
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:17,703
And you're a lawyer.
You know how to write it.

543
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:19,330
It wouldn't seem so odd.

544
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:24,543
I could say that he brought it home and
we decided to make some changes up here.

- I don't see why Heather should take half.
- Listen.

548

Nothing strange can happen
in his life now.

549

Not one thing out of the ordinary.

That's vital, the most important thing.

551

If it does,
the chances double that we get caught.

552
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:46,065
You'll get half of everything.

553
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:49,287
It'll be plenty.
No matter what it is, we'll be satisfied.

554
00:49:49,288 --> 00:49:50,736
We're not gonna get greedy.

It's not far from here.

I've asked Mr. Lowenstein

at the existence of this new will.

01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:18,723
Edmund hadn't mentioned
anything about it to me.

691

Mrs. Walker explained that when she and
her husband decided to make changes...

692
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:26,564
...they took care of it up here
for simplicity's sake.

693
01:06:26,732 --> 01:06:29,609
As you know, the new will
is almost identical to the old...

694
01:06:29,777 --> 01:06:32,278
...but for the disposition
of a few items.

695
01:06:32,446 --> 01:06:34,072
At the risk of oversimplifying...

696
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:37,659
...the thrust of the will is to divide
the estate in almost equal parts...

697
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:40,745
...between Heather Kraft
and Mrs. Walker.

Would you agree
with that assessment, Mr. Racine?

Edmund Walker's signature...

Miss Mary Ann Simpson.

No.

01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:32,088

HARDIN:
Everything's in order up to there.

718
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:06,748
The problem comes in the language
of the bequest to Heather.

719
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:08,833
It's a technical matter.

720
01:08:09,001 --> 01:08:11,503
In writing the will,
I'm afraid Mr. Racine violated...

721
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:14,964
...what's known as
"the rule against perpetuities."

722
01:08:15,132 --> 01:08:19,594
It forbids an inheritance to be passed
down indefinitely for generations.

723
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:23,515
I knew that a probate judge in Miami
would spot the mistake right away...

724
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:27,018
...so I thought I'd bring it up here
to Okeelanta County...

725
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:29,062
...since Edmund
had the residence here...

726
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:31,322
...and see if I could get lucky
with a judge...

727
01:08:31,323 --> 01:08:33,274
...who didn't know estate law
quite so well.

728
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:37,237
Perhaps find one with the same
kind of training as Mr. Racine.

729
01:08:37,404 --> 01:08:40,448
Unfortunately, my plan backfired.

730
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:45,036
I ran into a judge who had had
other dealings with Mr. Racine...

731
01:08:45,204 --> 01:08:47,080
...a Judge Costanza.

732
01:08:47,248 --> 01:08:50,708
It seems there were problems
with an estate in a case four years ago.

733
01:08:50,876 --> 01:08:52,961
Very different problems, it's true...

734
01:08:53,170 --> 01:08:56,673
...but on a will that Mr. Racine
prepared. It was quite a mess.

735
01:08:56,841 --> 01:08:59,217
Accusations of carelessness,
a malpractice suit.

736

740
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:12,397
It means, I'm afraid,
that Edmund's will is invalid.

741
01:09:12,606 --> 01:09:16,943
Edmund Walker died intestate,
as though there were no will at all.

01:09:22,575 --> 01:09:24,284
No, I don't.

745
01:09:24,451 --> 01:09:26,661
HARDIN: Perhaps Mr. Racine
would like to tell you.

746
01:09:30,082 --> 01:09:32,292
In Florida,
when a person dies without a will...

747
01:09:32,459 --> 01:09:35,879
...and there are no children
or surviving parents...

748
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:41,843
...then the spouse inherits everything.

01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:50,018

Though that was clearly not
your husband's intention.

753
01:09:56,317 --> 01:09:58,902

He intended Heather to benefit.

754
01:10:01,822 --> 01:10:03,031
Oh.

755
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:04,532
Of course.

756
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:06,326
Of course, I understand.

01:10:07,119 --> 01:10:08,620
Of course.

You look good in black.

759

I've missed you so badly.
I need you.

760
01:10:22,635 --> 01:10:25,762
I couldn't figure out how you got
my stationery. Then it came to me.

761
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:29,057
Edmund's signature must have been a snap.
I wouldn't challenge mine.

Please stop. I don't blame you

01:12:03,569 --> 01:12:07,280
- What do you mean?
OSCAR: I mean, she's poison.

776
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:09,490
Tell me what you know
about his death.

777
01:12:09,658 --> 01:12:12,243
What I read. He died in the fire.
Looks like arson.

778
01:12:12,411 --> 01:12:13,745
Was arson.

779
01:12:14,038 --> 01:12:15,788
Okay, it was arson.

780
01:12:15,956 --> 01:12:18,166
Don't know if he was setting it
and fucked up...

781
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:20,585
...or if that's just what
somebody wanted it to look like.

782
01:12:20,753 --> 01:12:23,254
Oh, he didn't set it.
Somebody offed him.

783
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:26,299
NED:
His people owned the place, right?

784
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:28,092
OSCAR:
That's right.

785
01:12:28,385 --> 01:12:30,845
And a very rough group of fellows too.

786
01:12:31,472 --> 01:12:34,640
Possible they wanted to cut Edmund out,
but it doesn't seem like...

787
01:12:34,808 --> 01:12:37,101
...a very neat way
to handle something like that.

788
01:12:37,269 --> 01:12:41,272
No, it's not their style. They're smooth.
They'd rather destroy you than kill you.

789
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:43,107
And they hate publicity.

790
01:12:43,275 --> 01:12:46,235
OSCAR: I'm more interested
in the grieving widow.

791
01:12:46,403 --> 01:12:48,446
PETER: Her sister-in-law
has ideas along that line.

792
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:50,865
She could barely contain herself today.

793
01:12:51,033 --> 01:12:52,450
I noticed that.

794
01:12:52,618 --> 01:12:55,620
But she wants to wait and see how
Matty treats her on the estate.

795
01:12:55,788 --> 01:12:58,623
- Doesn't want to blow it.
- How did you get involved?

796
01:12:59,958 --> 01:13:03,961
They asked me to redo the will.
I met with her and Edmund.

797
01:13:04,129 --> 01:13:05,630
It was pretty simple.

798
01:13:05,798 --> 01:13:07,465
[CHUCKLING]

799
01:13:08,634 --> 01:13:10,718
Miss Mary Ann Simpson
witnessed it with me.

800
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:13,137
Walker didn't seem to think
it was any big deal.

801
01:13:13,305 --> 01:13:15,807
OSCAR: That's it?
- That's it.

802
01:13:16,308 --> 01:13:18,226
- What was Simpson's story?
NED: I don't know.

803
01:13:18,435 --> 01:13:21,979
She was just passing through.
Old friend of the family's. Good-looking.

804
01:13:22,147 --> 01:13:23,564
On her way to Europe?

805
01:13:26,318 --> 01:13:28,861
The passport people
didn't have any record of it.

806
01:13:30,489 --> 01:13:32,281
What do you think?

807
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:34,867
About the wife.

808
01:13:37,454 --> 01:13:42,458
I suppose it's possible. I don't know much
about her except what I've seen.

809
01:13:43,335 --> 01:13:44,836
It wouldn't shock me anyway.

810
01:13:45,003 --> 01:13:47,004
PETER:
I have this feeling she's very bad news.

811
01:13:47,172 --> 01:13:49,841
Take some incredibly intelligent advice.
Stay away from her.

812
01:13:50,676 --> 01:13:52,844
He's right, for once.

813
01:13:57,182 --> 01:13:59,851
Well, I'm sorry, guys.

814
01:14:00,144 --> 01:14:02,019
I just can't do that.

815
01:14:02,771 --> 01:14:04,439
Why not?

816
01:14:05,065 --> 01:14:08,234
NED: Well, for one thing,
did you get a look at her?

817
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:12,321
That wouldn't be so meaningful,
except today she started coming on to me...

818
01:14:12,489 --> 01:14:15,324
...and that lady is about to come into
a great deal of money.

819
01:14:15,492 --> 01:14:19,537
Fact is, she invited me out there tonight
and I'm going, and I'm gonna keep going...

820
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:22,248
...as many days or nights...

821
01:14:22,416 --> 01:14:25,293
...or weekends as she'll have me.

822
01:14:25,586 --> 01:14:30,756
Ned, someday your dick is gonna
lead you into a very big hassle.

823
01:14:30,924 --> 01:14:32,717
That lady may have killed her husband.

824
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:35,386
Peter, she's not gonna inherit anything
by killing me.

825
01:14:36,013 --> 01:14:39,223
Besides, maybe she'll try
to fuck me to death.

826
01:14:47,232 --> 01:14:50,318
You've messed up before
and you'll mess up again. It's your nature.

827
01:14:50,527 --> 01:14:55,156
But they've always been small-time.
This might not be.

828
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:58,910
She's trouble, Ned. The real thing,
big-time, major-league trouble.

829
01:14:59,828 --> 01:15:01,662
Watch yourself.

830
01:15:10,088 --> 01:15:13,257
MATTY: Mary Ann and I left Wheaton
together and went to Chicago.

831
01:15:13,425 --> 01:15:15,009
We didn't know what we were doing.

832
01:15:16,011 --> 01:15:19,347
I got into bad trouble with drugs. Speed.

833
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:21,265
Real bad.

834
01:15:21,683 --> 01:15:23,643
I did things that...

835
01:15:25,604 --> 01:15:27,438
Worse than you can imagine.

836
01:15:27,606 --> 01:15:30,816
I thought I would die. I prayed I would.

837
01:15:32,986 --> 01:15:34,904
And then a man helped me.

838
01:15:35,113 --> 01:15:36,781
He got me clean.

839
01:15:36,949 --> 01:15:39,659
He didn't want much in return, either.

840
01:15:39,952 --> 01:15:44,455
He was a lawyer. He put me to work
in his office. I learned a lot there.

841
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:50,211
That's where I picked up the business
about making a will invalid.

842
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:52,296
It happened to him.

843
01:15:52,965 --> 01:15:57,635
I swear I never would have used you
if I had known about your case.

844
01:15:59,638 --> 01:16:02,014
I was afraid to tell you.

845
01:16:02,975 --> 01:16:04,934
I knew you wouldn't let me do it.

846
01:16:05,143 --> 01:16:08,646
I'm greedy, like you said.
I wanted us to have it all.

847
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:13,484
I don't blame you...

848
01:16:13,652 --> 01:16:15,987
...for thinking I'm bad.

849
01:16:16,697 --> 01:16:19,073
I am. I know it.

850
01:16:20,325 --> 01:16:23,119
I'd understand
if you cut me off right now.

851
01:16:23,287 --> 01:16:26,664
If you never trusted me again,
you'd probably be smart...

852
01:16:27,624 --> 01:16:30,084
...but you must believe one thing.

853
01:16:30,919 --> 01:16:32,587
I love you.

854
01:16:33,672 --> 01:16:37,133
I love you and I need you.

855
01:16:37,301 --> 01:16:40,052
And I want to be with you forever.

856
01:16:44,516 --> 01:16:46,851
They already think you're involved.

857
01:16:47,352 --> 01:16:49,228
I don't care.

858
01:16:51,106 --> 01:16:52,773
Great.

859
01:16:53,650 --> 01:16:56,694
There's nothing we can do about it now.

860
01:16:57,487 --> 01:17:00,323
In a little while,
we'll either have the money or we won't.

861
01:17:00,490 --> 01:17:02,450
It's out of our hands.

862
01:17:05,537 --> 01:17:07,705
I fired the housekeeper.

863
01:17:08,874 --> 01:17:11,500
We can stay together
as long as we want.

864
01:17:12,294 --> 01:17:14,253
We're all alone now.

865
01:17:42,282 --> 01:17:44,950
That's right,
I've been going down there a lot lately.

866
01:17:45,118 --> 01:17:48,871
Isn't that amazing? Miami. Jesus.

867
01:17:53,418 --> 01:17:55,753
I'm handling the purchases and property
down there.

868
01:17:55,921 --> 01:17:58,506
I'll be going back again in the future
if that's okay...

869
01:17:58,674 --> 01:18:01,050
...if it's still legal to go to Miami.

870
01:18:01,218 --> 01:18:03,177
- He's mad.
- I'm not. Why should I be mad...

871
01:18:03,345 --> 01:18:07,223
...because my friend here wants to know my
whereabouts the night of a recent murder?

872
01:18:07,391 --> 01:18:10,393
It's not so recent anymore.
Maybe he's feeling a bit of pressure.

873
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:12,061
OSCAR:
You brought this on yourself.

874
01:18:12,229 --> 01:18:15,147
I don't run this department.
There are people are watching this.

875
01:18:15,315 --> 01:18:17,441
They hear you're out there
banging the widow...

876
01:18:17,609 --> 01:18:20,194
...it tends to call attention to you.

877
01:18:20,362 --> 01:18:22,446
So don't give me that shit.

878
01:18:22,614 --> 01:18:24,115
That is my business.

879
01:18:24,282 --> 01:18:26,534
You mean, that's your fucking business.

880
01:18:26,702 --> 01:18:30,371
This whole damn case is getting crazy.

881
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:33,332
- You tell him about the glasses?
- No.

882
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:35,334
Seems that Walker always wore glasses.

883
01:18:35,502 --> 01:18:38,045
Steel-rimmed glasses.
A real fanatic about them.

884
01:18:38,213 --> 01:18:41,257
They were not on the scene.
Coroner says they should have been...

885
01:18:41,425 --> 01:18:44,677
...that even after the fire, the frames
would have been seared right into his...

886
01:18:44,845 --> 01:18:47,388
Ech. You don't wanna hear the details.

887
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:49,640
So what?

888
01:18:49,808 --> 01:18:52,101
It's looking like
he was killed somewhere else...

889
01:18:52,269 --> 01:18:54,937
...and brought there in his own car.

890
01:18:55,105 --> 01:18:58,274
Now, your honey, his wife,
said he left the house in the night...

891
01:18:58,442 --> 01:19:00,985
...driving himself
to some mysterious meeting.

892
01:19:01,153 --> 01:19:02,695
Is that vague enough for you?

893
01:19:02,863 --> 01:19:05,740
Look, what is this? What do you want?

894
01:19:05,907 --> 01:19:09,160
Am I supposed to be an undercover agent
for you guys or something?

895
01:19:09,327 --> 01:19:10,661
Interesting choice of phrase.

896
01:19:10,829 --> 01:19:12,830
Well, suppose tonight I ask her:

897
01:19:12,998 --> 01:19:16,542
"Say, did you kill your husband?
My friends were just wondering."

898
01:19:17,210 --> 01:19:18,335
That's a great idea.

899
01:19:18,503 --> 01:19:21,922
While you're at it, ask where
the glasses are, where she did it...

900
01:19:22,090 --> 01:19:24,091
Am I forgetting anything, Oscar?

901
01:19:24,259 --> 01:19:26,010
OSCAR: That one thing.
PETER: Oh, yeah.

902
01:19:26,178 --> 01:19:28,637
You're gonna love this, Ned,
this latest development.

903
01:19:28,805 --> 01:19:32,057
This is from the sister-in-law,
the Kraft woman.

904
01:19:32,225 --> 01:19:35,853
She's been driving me batty, convinced
she ain't gonna be cut in on the will.

905
01:19:36,021 --> 01:19:38,063
It seems a couple weeks
before the murder...

906
01:19:38,231 --> 01:19:41,525
...Walker's niece spent a while up here
with your friend Matty.

907
01:19:41,693 --> 01:19:45,196
One night, she wakes up,
goes to see her aunt...

908
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:47,656
...and catches the lady with some guy.

909
01:19:47,824 --> 01:19:51,076
PETER: You get it?
In the act or some fucking thing.

910
01:19:51,661 --> 01:19:54,371
We don't have all the details yet,
but Mrs. Kraft...

911
01:19:54,539 --> 01:19:57,082
...is bringing the little girl today
to tell her story.

912
01:19:57,250 --> 01:20:00,920
Oh, they're here. I passed them
on the way in. They're waiting outside.

913
01:20:01,087 --> 01:20:02,713
OSCAR:
Christ.

914
01:20:02,881 --> 01:20:05,883
I'm not sure I'm up to
dealing with this scene.

915
01:20:08,094 --> 01:20:09,637
Listen.

916
01:20:11,181 --> 01:20:14,433
You probably don't want to see
the Kraft woman right now.

917
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:19,814
She's pretty wild. So why don't you just
slip out the back way here?

918
01:20:21,775 --> 01:20:23,692
Are we done here?

919
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:27,655
Yeah, I've got it all here.

920
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:34,662
- Ned, I'm sorry I had to ask.
- I'll go out this way.

921
01:20:36,498 --> 01:20:40,084
I've had a lot of experience
with disgruntled people.

922
01:20:46,758 --> 01:20:48,717
I'll be at Stella's.

923
01:20:57,978 --> 01:21:00,104
Hello, Mrs. Kraft.

924
01:21:00,814 --> 01:21:02,523
Hello, Mr. Racine.

925
01:21:02,691 --> 01:21:04,191
How are you making out?

926
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:06,569
We're doing all right, I guess.

927
01:21:08,363 --> 01:21:10,281
You must be Heather.

928
01:21:11,116 --> 01:21:14,159
I'm Ned Racine. I've heard a lot
about you. It's nice to meet you.

929
01:21:14,327 --> 01:21:15,870
Thank you.

930
01:21:17,205 --> 01:21:19,748
I'm sorry our town
is so hot for your visit.

931
01:21:19,916 --> 01:21:22,209
It sure is.

932
01:21:22,961 --> 01:21:25,421
Well, goodbye.

933
01:21:25,589 --> 01:21:28,132
- Bye.
- Bye.

934
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:29,842
Bye.

935
01:21:39,936 --> 01:21:42,897
- The usual, my sweet.
STELLA: Two iced teas for Fred Astaire.

936
01:21:43,064 --> 01:21:46,317
Hey, Rosemary,
I'm going out for 10 minutes.

937
01:21:46,985 --> 01:21:50,654
- You ready to hear something wild?
- I don't know, I have had my share today.

938
01:21:50,822 --> 01:21:53,365
No, no, this is right up your alley.

939
01:21:59,497 --> 01:22:01,081
Little Heather...

940
01:22:01,249 --> 01:22:04,168
...goes out on the porch
and there's this dude with her aunt.

941
01:22:04,336 --> 01:22:07,504
And the guy is turned around
with his pants or shorts dropped...

942
01:22:07,672 --> 01:22:09,673
...so he's mooning the little girl, right?

943
01:22:09,841 --> 01:22:13,427
He and your friend are going at something
Heather can't quite figure out...

944
01:22:13,595 --> 01:22:17,014
...but which sounds suspiciously to me
like oral-genital contact...

945
01:22:17,182 --> 01:22:20,142
...which, I'm proud to say,
is no longer illegal in this state.

946
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:24,480
And the guy turns around to Heather.
Do you follow me so far?

947
01:22:24,898 --> 01:22:27,358
- Guess what he looks like.
- I don't know.

948
01:22:27,525 --> 01:22:32,071
Well, he looks about seven or eight inches
long, shiny and very, very bald.

949
01:22:36,034 --> 01:22:37,701
Poor little Heather!

950
01:22:37,869 --> 01:22:40,537
She'd never seen one angry before.

951
01:22:40,705 --> 01:22:43,540
Made quite an impression on her.
Yes, sirree.

952
01:22:43,708 --> 01:22:46,669
- That's the only thing she can remember.
- That's it?

953
01:22:46,836 --> 01:22:48,545
No, no.

954
01:22:49,464 --> 01:22:51,465
One other thing.

955
01:22:52,092 --> 01:22:55,177
She said the guy had very greasy hair,
wore it slicked back.

956
01:22:55,345 --> 01:22:58,847
"Like a Cuban," she says.
I love that part.

957
01:22:59,391 --> 01:23:01,058
Can you imagine poor little Heather?

958
01:23:01,226 --> 01:23:04,228
After getting a gander at that,
she has to slip back to bed and...

959
01:23:04,396 --> 01:23:07,106
This is the capper,
why she woke up in the first place:

960
01:23:07,273 --> 01:23:08,315
She had a nightmare.

961
01:23:08,483 --> 01:23:12,444
Can you imagine the kind of dreams she had
for the rest of the night?

962
01:23:17,701 --> 01:23:20,035
Don't say that.
Don't say you don't have them.

963
01:23:20,203 --> 01:23:22,413
I swear to you I don't.
What's wrong with you?

964
01:23:22,580 --> 01:23:24,915
They had to be here that night
when you cleaned up.

965
01:23:25,083 --> 01:23:27,418
Think hard. They've probably
got my prints on them.

966
01:23:27,585 --> 01:23:30,504
I wasn't looking for them.
I thought they were on Edmund.

967
01:23:30,672 --> 01:23:33,966
- Where could they have gone?
- I don't know.

968
01:23:36,803 --> 01:23:38,303
- Betty.
- The housekeeper?

969
01:23:38,471 --> 01:23:40,472
Where would she have put them?
You've been through his things.

970
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:41,807
She might have taken them.

971
01:23:41,975 --> 01:23:43,726
Listen to me. That's why I fired her.

972
01:23:43,893 --> 01:23:46,770
Because after Edmund's death,
she started acting strangely.

973
01:23:46,938 --> 01:23:49,106
She was watching me,
listening to my calls.

974
01:23:49,274 --> 01:23:51,191
That is crazy. You imagined it.

975
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:53,485
I know. I've been
imagining things too. Plenty.

976
01:23:53,653 --> 01:23:56,447
No. No, I could tell
there was a difference.

977
01:23:56,614 --> 01:24:00,117
Maybe she knew about us.
Maybe she wants something.

978
01:24:00,285 --> 01:24:03,328
Don't you think we would have
heard from her by now?

979
01:24:03,496 --> 01:24:05,831
MATTY:
I don't know what to think.

980
01:24:06,374 --> 01:24:08,333
I'm worried, Ned.

981
01:24:09,169 --> 01:24:13,464
But it's not about the glasses
or your friends. It's us.

982
01:24:13,798 --> 01:24:17,134
Your first reaction is to accuse me.

983
01:24:17,302 --> 01:24:20,220
- What's happening to you?
- I'm sorry.

984
01:24:23,141 --> 01:24:25,142
Hardin called today.

985
01:24:25,518 --> 01:24:29,271
He said that everything should be cleared
up by next week. I'll get the money.

986
01:24:29,439 --> 01:24:31,482
He apologized for the delay.

987
01:24:32,442 --> 01:24:34,943
They've been stalling.
They're dragging it out...

988
01:24:35,111 --> 01:24:37,613
...hoping to find a way
to implicate you.

989
01:24:37,781 --> 01:24:40,074
But they haven't been able to.

990
01:24:40,784 --> 01:24:43,494
Soon, it will be all ours.

991
01:24:43,828 --> 01:24:46,830
That's why we've got to
stay together, Ned.

992
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:48,332
It won't be long...

993
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:52,169
...and then we can get away from here,
out from under all of this.

994
01:24:53,630 --> 01:24:56,423
All we have is each other.

995
01:24:57,759 --> 01:25:01,470
I'd kill myself if I thought
this thing would destroy us.

996
01:25:03,348 --> 01:25:05,265
I couldn't take it.

997
01:26:38,193 --> 01:26:39,693
That's great.

998
01:26:39,861 --> 01:26:42,321
- Hi, Ned.
- What are you doing here?

999
01:26:42,488 --> 01:26:45,407
I was looking for you.
Do you always run this late?

1000
01:26:45,575 --> 01:26:48,660
No. I'm going down to Miami tomorrow.
I won't have time.

1001
01:26:49,621 --> 01:26:52,539
- What's in Miami? - Closing a real
estate deal I was working on.

1002
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:58,086
You're some kind of health nut.

1003
01:26:59,672 --> 01:27:01,798
Matty Walker smokes that same brand,
I noticed.

1004
01:27:01,966 --> 01:27:06,053
This gonna be one of those conversations?
Maybe I should have my lawyer present.

1005
01:27:06,221 --> 01:27:08,639
Buddy, your lawyer is present.

1006
01:27:18,483 --> 01:27:20,525
You know, that Edmund Walker
was a bad guy.

1007
01:27:20,693 --> 01:27:23,111
The more I find out,
the happier I am he's dead.

1008
01:27:23,279 --> 01:27:25,989
I figure it's a positive thing
for the world.

1009
01:27:26,157 --> 01:27:28,700
You're not known for being a hard-liner.

1010
01:27:28,868 --> 01:27:32,496
Well, I have my own standards.
I just try to keep them private.

1011
01:27:36,376 --> 01:27:38,919
As far as I'm concerned,
I don't care who killed him...

1012
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:41,880
...and I don't care
who gets rich because of it.

1013
01:27:44,759 --> 01:27:48,262
But Oscar is not like that.

1014
01:27:49,222 --> 01:27:52,849
You know, his whole life is based on
doing the right thing.

1015
01:27:53,017 --> 01:27:54,768
He's the only person I know like that.

1016
01:27:54,936 --> 01:27:58,480
Sometimes, it's a real pain in the ass.
Even for him.

1017
01:28:01,901 --> 01:28:04,820
Oscar's unhappy right now.
I mean, he is in pain.

1018
01:28:05,029 --> 01:28:08,198
- Why is that?
- Because he likes you.

1019
01:28:08,741 --> 01:28:09,866
Even better than I do...

1020
01:28:10,034 --> 01:28:13,870
...that's why he's busting his butt
trying to find this Mary Ann Simpson.

1021
01:28:16,207 --> 01:28:18,166
They found her place
in Miami yesterday.

1022
01:28:18,334 --> 01:28:19,543
Yeah?

1023
01:28:19,711 --> 01:28:23,880
But the woman herself was gone.
Seems like she left in a hurry.

1024
01:28:24,966 --> 01:28:28,051
Oscar thought any story
she could tell might help.

1025
01:28:28,219 --> 01:28:30,470
He thinks you need help.

1026
01:28:31,723 --> 01:28:33,682
Oh, come on.

1027
01:28:37,103 --> 01:28:39,896
Someone is putting you
into deep trouble, my friend.

1028
01:28:41,316 --> 01:28:44,151
From 3:30 to 5 a.m.
the night Walker was killed...

1029
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:47,237
...someone called
your hotel room repeatedly.

1030
01:28:47,405 --> 01:28:49,906
The hotel didn't wanna
put them through...

1031
01:28:50,074 --> 01:28:53,160
...but whoever it was
convinced them that it was an emergency.

1032
01:28:53,745 --> 01:28:56,872
Your phone rang and rang,
but you didn't answer.

1033
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:59,082
- That's easy.
- Don't.

1034
01:28:59,250 --> 01:29:00,375
Don't say anything.

1035
01:29:00,585 --> 01:29:03,086
Just save it for some other time.

1036
01:29:04,589 --> 01:29:06,173
It gets worse.

1037
01:29:10,345 --> 01:29:14,097
Now someone's trying
to give us Edmund's glasses.

1038
01:29:17,185 --> 01:29:21,813
We don't know who and we don't know
what the glasses will tell us...

1039
01:29:22,732 --> 01:29:25,817
...but our negotiations are continuing.

1040
01:29:35,244 --> 01:29:38,663
I wish I knew what to tell you, Ned,
but I don't have any good ideas.

1041
01:29:48,466 --> 01:29:50,092
I'll see you.

1042
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:28,797
We know each other, don't we?

1043
01:30:29,006 --> 01:30:31,842
Michael Glenn, with Bashford-Hillerman.

1044
01:30:32,927 --> 01:30:34,511
Ned Racine.

1045
01:30:35,555 --> 01:30:38,140
Oh, Christ, I've done it again.

1046
01:30:38,307 --> 01:30:41,268
I'm just here waiting for some people.

1047
01:30:44,397 --> 01:30:45,814
Okay, this is silly.

1048
01:30:45,982 --> 01:30:48,942
You're not still mad
about that Gourson business?

1049
01:30:50,027 --> 01:30:51,027
We had to do it.

1050
01:30:51,195 --> 01:30:54,698
Costanza practically insisted
that we sue you.

1051
01:30:55,116 --> 01:30:57,868
Nobody at our place likes malpractice
against other lawyers.

1052
01:30:58,035 --> 01:30:59,578
Forget it.

1053
01:31:01,497 --> 01:31:04,666
Well, hey, I tried to make it up to you.

1054
01:31:06,878 --> 01:31:08,879
You ever meet a lady
named Matty Walker?

1055
01:31:09,714 --> 01:31:11,214
You'd remember her.

1056
01:31:11,382 --> 01:31:13,467
- A very hot number.
- Matty Walker.

1057
01:31:13,634 --> 01:31:15,135
Yeah, I met her at a party.

1058
01:31:15,303 --> 01:31:17,721
She said she was going up there...

1059
01:31:17,889 --> 01:31:20,474
...and wanted to know about lawyers.

1060
01:31:21,517 --> 01:31:23,894
- So I gave her your name. Oh, boy.
- When was this?

1061
01:31:24,061 --> 01:31:27,689
I don't know. A long time.
Maybe last year sometime.

1062
01:31:27,857 --> 01:31:30,484
- I gotta get going.
- You tell her about the Gourson case?

1063
01:31:31,527 --> 01:31:34,654
Hey, pal, I was trying to get you work.

1064
01:31:35,239 --> 01:31:36,573
Jesus. Are you nuts?

1065
01:31:36,741 --> 01:31:38,909
Did you tell her about Gourson?

1066
01:31:39,076 --> 01:31:42,454
Maybe I told her how we met.
Yeah, maybe.

1067
01:32:10,399 --> 01:32:13,151
BEVERLY:
Is something wrong with your phone?

1068
01:32:14,278 --> 01:32:16,446
It's just off the hook. Why?

1069
01:32:17,031 --> 01:32:20,158
Teddy Lewis is in County.
He's very anxious to talk to you.

1070
01:32:23,704 --> 01:32:27,666
I don't know. It's a thing in Lauderdale,
but they're not telling me.

1071
01:32:29,418 --> 01:32:31,461
- I'm a little worried.
- I'll find out.

1072
01:32:32,213 --> 01:32:34,339
No, that's not why I called you.

1073
01:32:34,507 --> 01:32:36,466
In fact, I got me another lawyer.

1074
01:32:40,763 --> 01:32:42,681
I think it would be better.

1075
01:32:43,307 --> 01:32:48,728
- You know Schlisgal?
- Yeah, he's good.

1076
01:32:52,817 --> 01:32:57,153
This broad came to me last week.
A real looker.

1077
01:32:57,321 --> 01:33:00,156
She said that you told her

this other girl's name...

1163
01:44:52,286 --> 01:44:55,079

three years ago...

...that she's living as this other girl,
this person from her past.

in the whole world...

...who knows who she really is.

on the line...

1177

...she's finally going to collect,
that person shows up.

That girl finds her
and threatens to expose her...

1179
01:45:50,260 --> 01:45:52,970
...so Matty starts paying her off.

1180
01:45:53,138 --> 01:45:56,265
Maybe she even promised to cut her in
on Edmund's money.

Now she's got to share it
with two people.
