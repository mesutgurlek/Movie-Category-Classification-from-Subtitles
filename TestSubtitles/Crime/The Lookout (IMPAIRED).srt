The three bears find Goldilocks
asleep in their beds.

And then, um, she takes off.

146
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:35,144
Exactly. All right, now, that's the end.
What happened before that?

147
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:41,119
Um, one goes, "Someone's been sleeping
in my bed, and she's still there."

00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:44,350
And before that it was,
"Someone is sitting in my chair."

149
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:47,415
Yeah, and then the bear kid's chair's
all jacked up.

150
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,519
Then it goes all the way back
to her walking in the door.

151
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:54,362
- First she walks in the forest.
- You sequence just fine.

152
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:59,530

work backwards. Write that down.

154
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,173
- He's in a good mood.
- Oh, OK.

155
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,012
- Good night.
- Good night.

156
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:55,424
The harvest checks go out
in a week or so.

157
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:59,430
That means we're going to be very busy
the next few weeks.

158
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:04,765
Which is why I want you to write down

159
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:08,102
"bank extra clean"
in your little notebook.

160
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:10,164
Good night.

161
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:13,976
Mr. Tuttle?

162
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:19,414
I'd like to apply to the executive
training program in Wichita,

163
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:23,478
but before I can, I have to have worked
100 hours as a teller at the branch.

164
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:26,183
- Take that up with Mrs. Lange.
- I have already.

165
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:29,022
We've been practicing.
She gave me some money.

166
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,085
She what?

167
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:33,154
See?

168
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:38,632
You said you'd think about
giving me some hours at a window.

169
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:41,229
You have to be able
to keep track of the debits.

170
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:43,639
A good teller is primarily
a good counter.

171
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:46,303
A teller keeps track of money
all day long,

172
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:50,712
taking care to keep the corners on bills
facing the same way.

173
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,774
At the end...

174
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:56,681
Um... The end...

175
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:00,950
Ends...

176
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,225
At the end... At the end of the day,

177
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:07,493
the teller balances the cash
against the payout tickets.

178
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:10,831
A good teller can go for years
without being out of balance.

179
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:13,394
Mrs. Lange has never been
out of balance yet.

180
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,339
But the real key
is a friendly personality.

181
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:20,868
The motto of a teller is,
"Be friendly and accurate."

182
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:23,710
- "But mostly be accurate."
- Very good, Chris.

183
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:27,684
Mrs. Lange also says the women's
bathroom fixture needs a new bulb.

184
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:29,744
Good night.

Yep.

Hey.

Can you break a fifty?
Like, tens and fives?

Damn. And I thought I was good-Iooking.

- So far.

Well, that's all that matters, right?

Yeah, she's good, man.
She's married. She has a baby.

- OK.

00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,945
- Yeah. Where are you?
- It's 2.50, chief.

230

Ten, twenty, thirty, five, forty...

You were supposed to be here

- Sorry, how much?
- 2.50.

233

That's not my problem.
I guess I'll see you later. OK, bye.

- Do you need any change with that?
- No, keep it.

- Thanks, chief.
- Whoa. Excuse me, uh... T.J.

- No, no, no, no.

Yeah. Whatever.

Prick. Shit, I apologize
for that guy, Chris.

[Chris] No, it's OK.

243
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:05,686
You know, I find myself apologizing
for people pretty often these days.

244
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:12,437
I heard something happened to you.
So, what was it? Motorcycle accident?

245
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:15,132
If you don't mind me asking.
I'm just curious.

246
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:17,801
It was a car accident.
I was driving at night

247
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:22,540
and I hit a combine that was stalled
in the middle of the road, old Route 24.

248
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,606
Well, how does a thing like that happen?

249
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,618
- I had the lights off.
- Really?

250
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:32,851
They say I got thrown 90 feet.

251
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:34,653
Wait, I'm sorry. "They" say?

252
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:36,819
Well, no, I can't remember any of it.

253
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:39,159
Well, thank God for that.

254
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:41,995
I remember, uh, right before it
and right after it

255
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:46,731
and one moment where I thought
the medevac was gonna land on top of me.

256
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,796
Anybody die?

257
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,133
Yeah, two friends.

258
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,940
- You do any time?
- No.

259
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:58,107
But you're doing your time right now,
though, right?

260
00:21:58,183 --> 00:22:01,118
So, you drink near beer and what else?

261
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:05,054
It's like I can pick up a glass
with this hand,

262
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:07,683
can't always drink from it.

263
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:10,819
I fall asleep a lot, just nod off
in the middle of things.

264
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:13,126
- Yeah, me, too.
- [Chuckles] Oh, yeah?

265
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:18,966
Yeah. Well, I call tomatoes "lemons."
I know that's wrong.

266
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:23,064
And sometimes certain colors
have certain smells.

267
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:25,371
- That's weird.
- [Inhaler hisses]

268
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:30,077
Well, we all got our problems, right?

269
00:22:30,148 --> 00:22:35,950
There's an expression: "God closes
a door, but he opens a window."

270
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,819
Or he closes the window
and he opens the door.

271
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,619
My point is...

272
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:45,095
...sometimes something good
comes from an accident, you know?

273
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:48,655
Sometimes you're out there and you...

274
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:53,561
Man, she really wears that sweater,
doesn't she?

275
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:56,763
Fuck.

276
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:02,712
Anyway, it was a pleasure, Chris.

277
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:05,113
- Yeah.
- Take it easy.

- No, I'm afraid not.
- You used the thin ones, right?

288
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:52,923
- Not the thick nighttime ones?
- Yes, Alison, I used the thin ones.

289
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:55,459
You look great.
Lots of color in your cheeks.

- Not sure about this coat, though.
- Where's that from? Tenth grade?

291
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:02,928
- Well, I like this coat.
- I bumped into Marilyn Hess last week.

292
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,970
She had Charlotte with her.
Wasn't she in your class?

293
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,940
She was in my class.
Conrad was in Chris's.

294
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:13,102
Charlotte said for you to call her.
She looks fantastic.

295
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,772
- Lost quite a bit of weight.
- I love mushrooms.

296
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:19,840
What do you call a mushroom who goes
into the bar, buys everybody a drink?

297
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:22,944
- I don't know. What?
- A fungi.

298
00:25:25,123 --> 00:25:28,183
This is all very good.
The relish in particular is nice.

299
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:32,026
- Not too tart, not too sweet.
- It was my grandmother's recipe.

300
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:36,056
Any other old family recipes?
We can use them for the restaurant.

301
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:39,262
- Restaurant?
- Chris didn't tell you?

302
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:41,328
No. He didn't tell us.

303
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:44,432
What exactly would you do
at a restaurant, Chris?

304
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:51,441
- Well, I'd help Lewis.
- We found a space, but it needs work.

305
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:54,041
- [Barbara] Where?
- Waverly, near Overland.

306
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:56,815
- Where is that?
- Southside. It's a gas station.

307
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:59,254
A gas station? Really?

308
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:03,090
We'd keep the door open during summer
for an al fresco kind of thing.

309
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:05,959
If it's a gas station,
you'd have to do some work...

310
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:08,864
We're just fucking talking about it, OK?

311
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,563
Excuse me.

312
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:31,546
- There are some steps.
- Oh.

313
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:34,456
Well, then, you better carry me.

314
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:36,517
Really?

315
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:44,100
- [Knock on door]
- Chris?

316
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:45,761
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

317
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:49,830
We gotta go. If I don't get her
down soon, she'll never sleep.

318
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:55,106
You should come by sometime.
We'll hang out.

319
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:59,446
And Dad's waiting down in the war room.

320
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:02,247
Hey, uh, you remember a Gary Spargo?

321
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,413
- Who?
- Gary Spargo.

322
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:06,980
He said he went out with you
a couple of times.

323
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:09,925
Well, he probably did.

324
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:13,954
- You look good. It's great to see you.
- Thanks.

325
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:16,967
Alison, right?

326
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:20,801
Say goodbye to Uncle Chris.
All right, we'll see you later.

327
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:26,907
In the last three years, we opened two
Jaguar stores and one Land Rover store.

328
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:31,312
So we're all about Ford now. But a
Porsche<i>l</i>Audi franchise, that'd be tight.

329
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:33,817
What do you do
for the company, Cameron?

330
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:35,910
As little as possible.

331
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,319
Boy, you got me on the run here.

332
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,620
- There's a comforting sound.
- This new?

333
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:43,456
It was a gift from Charlie.
Whitehall, my partner.

334
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:46,986
Yeah, I know who Charlie Whitehall is.

335
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:50,159
- It's a nice gun.
- It's your move.

336
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:52,726
Check, by the way.

337
00:27:56,908 --> 00:27:58,899
What'd you do?

338
00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:02,708
- Sure you wanna do that?
- I think so.

339
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:05,306
You're gonna lose your queen, right?

340
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:07,874
- Really?
- Yeah, I'm gonna take her.

341
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:15,351
Check. In fact, checkmate.

342
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:20,996
- I didn't see that.
- I got lucky.

343
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:23,660
- Good game, Dad.
- We got time for another quick one.

344
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:25,794
I think we should go. Lewis, wanna go?

345
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,701
Would you rather I let you win?

346
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:33,438
Dad, I can't play chess anymore.

347
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:36,110
I'm sorry.

348
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:42,812
- Well, it's good seeing you.
- Good seeing you.

349
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,878
Happy Thanksgiving, son.

350
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:49,757
Can I say something?
You won't get upset?

351
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:51,819
[Chris] What?

352
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:55,029
I don't think
you should go home anymore.

353

[Knocking]

354
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:11,905
- Jesus, Ted, you snuck up on me.
- I'm supposed to sneak up on you.

355
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:15,043
They didn't have no more jellies,
so I got you a custard.

356
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,111
- Thanks. You got a cold, Ted?
- [Sneezes]

357
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:21,386
No wonder I don't got pneumonia, given
the house is cold enough to hang meat.

358
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:22,448
How come?

359
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:24,961
Sherry won't have the heat on
after nine.

360
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:26,496
Because of the baby.

361
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:28,828
We don't refer to it
as "the baby" no more.

362
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:32,233
- We don't?
- Sherry calls it "the little engine."

363
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:34,635
- It makes her hot all the time.
- Right.

364
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:37,800
Doctor told her she's got
three times more blood in her

365
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:39,844
and that's why she can't cool off.

366
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:43,142
Kid's not even born yet,
I'm already awake all night.

367
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:47,708
You're lucky you don't ever
have to worry about that stuff.

368
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,812
I gotta go.
Remember, lock the back door.

369
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:52,516
I will.

370
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,784

I used to dance at Wet Willy's.
You know that place in Raytown?

378
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:39,062
It got closed down
on account of debts,

379

so right now I'm working with Maura

- Yeah. Yeah, that was a good game.
- Yeah, it was.

00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:12,586
You got your second five-minute major
right at the end of the game.

403
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:14,928
Next game you would have
sat on the bench.

404
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:19,026
But it was the last game of the season,
and you knew that it didn't matter.

405
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:22,834
So what do you do? You go and slash

00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:02,350
And by stage, I'm assuming
you mean the kind with a pole?

455
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,888
- What do you mean?
- Let's move on.

456
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:07,948
- Where'd you meet her?
- Gary introduced me to her.

457
00:37:08,025 --> 00:37:11,358
- Who's Gary? Gary who?
- Gary Spargo.

458
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:13,590
- Do I know this guy?
- I don't think so.

459
00:37:13,664 --> 00:37:16,827
- I just met him down at the local.
- Huh.

460
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:23,402
- Well, I better get some sleep.
- Yeah. Yeah, you better.

461
00:37:23,474 --> 00:37:25,806
You dog.

462
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:31,705
Gary Spargo.

463
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:59,267
[Groaning]

464
00:37:59,343 --> 00:38:01,402
- [Sighs]
- [Urinating]

465
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:05,408
Whoa! You scared me.

466
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,749
- I'm Chris.
- Yeah, yeah. Aaron Cork.

467
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:16,893
Got a good grip. Come on in.
We've been waiting on you.

468
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:22,228
- Is turkey supposed to be rare?
- I don't think so.

469
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:26,236
I totally undercooked it. I've gotta
put it back in. You have to help me.

470
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,636
Hey. You made it.

471
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:32,107
Tortilla salad, pierogies, egg rolls.
We made too much food.

472
00:38:32,176 --> 00:38:37,045
- There's nine of us.
- There's seven. You, me, Cork, Marty...

473
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:38,445
Never mind.

474
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:46,115
I'm the chef.
Go on. They're waiting for you.

475
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:49,853
You smoke a joint to relax,
but you won't let me rub your shoulders.

476
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:51,588
I will never let you touch me.

477
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:54,187
You're not comfortable
with your sexuality.

478
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:55,926
Don't move.

479
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,595
Everybody,
this is Chris "Slap Shot" Pratt.

480
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,331
Hey, Chris. How you doing?

481
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:04,897
- Here's the Corker. Avoid that guy.
- Too late. We're old pals.

482
00:39:04,975 --> 00:39:09,309
This is Marty. Marty is the guy
you wanna teach you how to surf.

483
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:13,339
- He's the only boy in Kansas knows how.
- I went to Framington, man.

484
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:15,544
We played you guys in Division A.

485
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:18,713
- I didn't really do sports.
- Gare, we gotta jam.

486
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:20,188
Too bad.

487
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:24,189
How many of these things
you gonna need?

488
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:27,059
- I'm gonna take all of them. Thanks.
- Cool.

489
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:29,656
Good seeing you guys.

490
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:32,066
Marty, watch out. It's heavy.

491
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:35,902
- Hey, sit down. Sit down.
- This your farm?

492
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:40,433
My Uncle Bone found it
and kind of negotiated with the owner.

493
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:42,342
- Wanna try some wine?
- I can't.

494
00:39:42,413 --> 00:39:44,313
Come on. Take it.

495
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:46,907
- Marty?
- Yes.

496
00:39:46,984 --> 00:39:49,646
Nice. One for me.

497
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,518
And toast.

498
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:56,492
How about, uh... Fuck it. Family, right?

499
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,926
- Hey, yeah. Cheers, man.
- Family's good.

500
00:39:58,996 --> 00:40:00,588
Family.

501
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:03,599
- Welcome.
- Who are all these people?

502
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:06,500
- Whose place is this?
- Friend of a friend. Bone?

503
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:09,733
- Dinner is served.
- It's about time.

504
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:11,798
- Can we get some water?
- Food.

505
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:15,107
- Why the hell we eating burritos?
- Get your own water.

506
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:17,977
- Want some gravy?
- What's wrong?

507
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:21,984
Nothing.
I just remembered why I came here.

508
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:27,251
- [Chattering]
- [Music playing]

509
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:42,261
I'm just saying...

510
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:47,572
[Gary] Check this out.

511
00:40:54,218 --> 00:40:56,413
[Maura]... some old farmhouse.

512
00:40:56,487 --> 00:40:58,717
I don't know where it is.

513
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,723
No, that's water.

514
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:04,621
Mommy's doing dishes.

515
00:41:04,695 --> 00:41:08,290
Mommy's cleaning up
after a bunch of pigs.

516
00:41:08,365 --> 00:41:11,357
I'll see you in three weeks.

517
00:41:11,435 --> 00:41:16,566
Tell Grandma to put it on the calendar
this time. I love you, too.

518
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,835
<i>[Gunfire on TV]</i>

519
00:41:20,344 --> 00:41:21,333
Hey, Gare.

520
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:26,744
Hey, man. Why don't you come on down?

521
00:41:28,285 --> 00:41:30,276
Couldn't sleep, huh?

522
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:34,347
Well, that's the thing about good wine.
Doesn't make you sleepy.

523
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:37,883
But, then, it doesn't give you
a hangover either, so...

524
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:40,362
Unless your brain's all fucked up.

525
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:43,525
- You played for Framington, right?
- No, man.

526
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:47,762
Let me just clean up some of this mess.

527
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:48,896
[Groans]

528
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:52,170
What's this?

529
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:56,577
This? This is a project I've been
working on for very many months.

530
00:41:56,647 --> 00:42:01,380
Probably not ready
for anyone to see yet, but such is life.

531
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:04,387
- These all banks?
- Mm-hmm. That's right, Chris.

532
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:08,357
They're all banks.

533
00:42:08,425 --> 00:42:10,689
Why are you taking pictures of banks?

534
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:13,787
- Because I'm gonna rob one of them.
- [Both chuckling]

535
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,957
Well, we're gonna rob one of them.

536
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:18,900
Some nice little farm bank
in the ass-end of nowhere

537
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:22,769
where they get
all that winter harvest cash.

538
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,502
You know what I'm talking about?

539
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:29,535
- You wanna steal from farmers?
- No, Chris.

540
00:42:29,613 --> 00:42:34,107
I'm gonna steal from the corporate
fuckers who rape the farmers.

541
00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:37,244
Agribusiness fat cats
who give the American farmer

542
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:39,881
enough to grow his crop
but not enough to live.

543
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:43,484
- Fucking tragedy is what it is.
- Totally tragic.

544
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:47,588
So we gotta find a bank
in the middle of a lot of big farms

545
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:50,930
where one time a year,
i.e., right now,

546
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:53,492
they're gonna fill that vault with cash

547
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:57,701
so that Farmer John can pay
Juan or Ramon to pick his crops.

548
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:04,206
There's this quiet, empty place

549
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:05,873
with no security to speak of,

550
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:09,078
and this quiet, empty place
no one really knows exists.

551
00:43:10,054 --> 00:43:14,548
I mean, isn't that why you drive an hour
and a half each way to work there?

552
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,451
What is this?

553
00:43:19,863 --> 00:43:24,061
Chris, I will totally understand if
you feel betrayed, but I need your help.

554
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:26,694
You want me to rob the bank.

555
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:30,069
- I can't do that.
- Why not, huh? Because it's wrong?

556
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:35,009
I don't know, but if I had... If I had
my life ripped out from underneath me

557
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:38,207
the way you had your life
ripped out from underneath you,

558
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:42,616
I don't think I'd give even half a rat's
ass about what was right or wrong.

559
00:43:42,686 --> 00:43:45,382
I'd just fucking want
my old life back, you know?

560
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:49,222
Look at this shit.
Mopping floors, man.

561
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:52,626
Don't you want your old life back?

562
00:43:52,696 --> 00:43:55,494
- You can't give that to me.
- No, I can't.

563
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:58,296
But I can give you something
maybe even better.

564
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:00,735
I can give you the power.

565
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:03,568
- Power?
- Mm-hmm.

566
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,973
Power.

567
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:08,603
Why don't you sit down?
I'll tell you about it.

568
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,110
Please?

569
00:44:11,181 --> 00:44:16,949
My old man used to say to me, probably
the only thing we ever really agreed on,

570
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:19,751
whoever has the money has the power.

571
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:22,155
You might wanna jot that down
in your book.

572
00:44:22,226 --> 00:44:24,956
It's something
you're gonna need to remember.

573
00:44:25,029 --> 00:44:28,328
Do you have the power right now
in your life, Chris? Huh?

574
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:30,799
- Do you?
- I don't know.

575
00:44:30,868 --> 00:44:35,396
How many janitors you know
have any kind of power to speak of?

576
00:44:37,241 --> 00:44:40,005
Here's a question.

577
00:44:40,077 --> 00:44:42,443
Who pays for your life?

578
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:45,175
You go to the ATM,
what, two, three times a week?

579
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:47,740
- Three.
- Three times. Wow.

580
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:51,254
Where does that money come from?
You drive a car.

581
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:54,347
Who pays for that?
Who pays for the insurance?

582
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:57,485
Given your track history,
it must be more than the rent,

583
00:44:57,561 --> 00:45:00,462
which gets paid on the first
of every month by who?

584
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:02,192
- Daddy.
- Bingo.

585
00:45:02,266 --> 00:45:05,326
Your old man,
he'll pay money to take care of you,

586
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:09,463
but he won't give you enough money
to take care of yourself. Why not?

587
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:13,135
He doesn't think that you can,
so he just doles out enough money

588
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:16,668
so that you have to depend on him.

589
00:45:16,747 --> 00:45:20,547
You're as stuck as the farmers, Chris.
You star in your own tragedy.

590
00:45:20,617 --> 00:45:23,017
My father would give me money
if I asked.

591
00:45:23,087 --> 00:45:27,251
Hey, hey, hey.
That's... That's bullshit.

592
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:30,619
I'm sorry. Let's call him up.

593
00:45:32,796 --> 00:45:34,354
Call him up, ask him.

594
00:45:34,431 --> 00:45:38,925
Ask him for ten grand
and see what he says.

595
00:45:39,002 --> 00:45:43,336
Hell, ask him for one grand
and see what he says.

596
00:45:44,808 --> 00:45:48,369
Tell him you wanna start a business.

597
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:52,915
You can't.

598
00:45:52,983 --> 00:45:58,250
I know. I mean, you know,
I went to prison for my sins, Chris,

599
00:45:58,322 --> 00:46:00,722
so I don't have to carry them
around with me.

600
00:46:00,791 --> 00:46:05,091
But you, your old man picked up the tab,

601
00:46:05,162 --> 00:46:08,689
so now you drive out
Old Farm Road 24 once a week

602
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:12,224
to the spot just to remind yourself,
keep it fresh in your head,

603
00:46:12,302 --> 00:46:16,398
just what a piece of shit
you think you are.

604
00:46:16,473 --> 00:46:19,033
- I thought we were friends.
- We are friends.

605
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:23,978
Outside of some old blind guy
dressed like Larry Flynt,

606
00:46:24,047 --> 00:46:27,039
I'm the best friend you got right now,
and I mean that.

607
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:31,110
You were Chris Pratt. I was three years
ahead of you and I looked up to you.

608
00:46:31,188 --> 00:46:34,419
You were fucking beautiful.

609
00:46:34,491 --> 00:46:35,856
But then...

610
00:46:39,196 --> 00:46:43,963
Well, now... I'm gonna help you.

611
00:46:45,002 --> 00:46:47,835
- How?
- I'll say it again.

612
00:46:47,905 --> 00:46:50,897
Maybe you'll write it down this time.

613
00:46:52,676 --> 00:46:55,668
Whoever has the money has the power.

614
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:04,951
Chris? Where are you going?
Are you leaving?

615
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:19,826
Come on, sweetie.

616
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:46,458
[Lewis] We figure it's 30,000
to convert to a restaurant,

617
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:50,330
another ten or so to get us up on
our feet, plus or minus a few thousand.

618
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,426
Show him the menu, kid.

619
00:47:57,441 --> 00:47:59,204
Is there a separate dinner menu?

620
00:47:59,276 --> 00:48:02,177
We're just gonna be open
for breakfast and lunch.

621
00:48:02,246 --> 00:48:05,738
- That way we have our nights free.
- I see.

622
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:08,011
OK, we have the Abbie, the Huey.

623
00:48:08,085 --> 00:48:11,919
- Who are these sandwiches named after?
- People I've admired.

624
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:15,584
- We could name one after you.
- I don't think that's necessary.

625
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:19,151
- Sure, sure. Why not?
- Well, that's very kind, but...

626
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:22,460
What's your first name?

627
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:24,898
- Reuben.
- What's your middle name?

628
00:48:24,968 --> 00:48:28,062
- Lewis...
- 30,000 seems a little low, boys.

629
00:48:28,138 --> 00:48:32,370
- This place is a gas station now?
- Yeah, but you make that work for you.

630
00:48:32,442 --> 00:48:37,379
Keep the gas station theme, maybe
you park a VW bus at one of the pumps,

631
00:48:37,447 --> 00:48:39,711
paint the name of the place on the side.

632
00:48:39,783 --> 00:48:44,243
Yeah, the name of the place.
Uh... Yes. Lew's...

633
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:47,552
Lew's Your Lunch.
See, I'm Lewis, Lew.

634
00:48:47,624 --> 00:48:50,787
The place is just gonna be open
for breakfast and...

635
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:52,692
It's very clever.

636
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:56,460
- But we don't have to call it that.
- Yeah, I got lots of ideas.

637
00:48:56,533 --> 00:49:01,163
Aside from that Reuben hiccup,
I think it went pretty well.

638
00:49:01,238 --> 00:49:05,675
I've got a good feeling about it.
Our man Hearn was jazzed.

639
00:49:05,742 --> 00:49:10,441
I don't know if you noticed. I think
he was pretty excited, don't you think?

640
00:49:11,048 --> 00:49:13,107
Chris?

641
00:49:13,183 --> 00:49:16,744
- Chris?
- I'm right here, Lewis.

642
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:19,653
- I thought you left me.
- I didn't leave you.

643
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:25,460
Come on. I'll drive you back to work.

644
00:49:25,529 --> 00:49:29,522
[Reggie] Who can tell me
our three organizational strategies?

645
00:49:31,335 --> 00:49:33,326
- Ritual.
- [Writing on chalkboard]

646
00:49:35,572 --> 00:49:37,563
<i>Pattern.</i>

647
00:49:39,576 --> 00:49:42,170
<i>And... repetition.</i>

648
00:49:42,245 --> 00:49:44,236
- [Chris] Shit.
- <i>Very good.</i>

649
00:50:04,368 --> 00:50:06,359
Hey.

650
00:50:13,543 --> 00:50:19,038
If you ever wanna stay late,
we could practice counting or...

651
00:50:19,116 --> 00:50:22,244
Technically, I don't know
that I'm pussy-whipped per se,

652
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:24,685
- but she's got me on a goddamned pager.
- [Beeps]

653
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:28,555
In case she breaks water or whatever
while I'm on my shift.

654
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:30,388
I don't know. Oh!

655
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:33,156
Hey, missed a spot.

656
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:35,596
Right there.

657
00:50:35,665 --> 00:50:37,428
See?

658
00:50:56,486 --> 00:50:59,080
<i>[Phone ringing]</i>

- <i>[Chris] Dad?</i>

00:51:00,957 --> 00:51:04,188
- Chris? What time is it?
- <i>I don't know.</i>

661
00:51:04,261 --> 00:51:06,889
- Is he all right?
- Tell her I'm all right.

662
00:51:06,963 --> 00:51:10,763
- <i>He's fine. You all right? You sure?</i>
- Yeah, Dad, I'm fine.

663
00:51:10,834 --> 00:51:13,701
I just wanted to know
if I could borrow $10,000.

664
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:16,671
- What?
- I need to borrow $10,000.

665
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,231
- What for?
- I just need it.

666
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:23,177
- It's three o'clock in the morning...
- <i>OK, then, $ 1,000.</i>

667
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:27,774
- Could I borrow $1,000?
- <i>Is this for that stupid restaurant?</i>

668
00:51:27,851 --> 00:51:29,910
- No.
- Are you in some kind of trouble?

669
00:51:29,986 --> 00:51:33,149
No, Dad, I'm not in trouble.
I just wanted to call you...

670
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:36,283
<i>Because if you are,</i>
<i>I wanna help out in any way I can.</i>

671
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:40,693
I just think you should come over and
we should talk about it face to face.

672
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:43,289
I have an idea.
I wanted to start a business.

673
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:47,928
With $1,000? Exactly what sort of
business could you start with $1,000?

674
00:51:48,004 --> 00:51:53,067
Well, I was thinking I could start
a skate-sharpening business.

675
00:51:53,143 --> 00:51:56,738
You know, over at the...
over at the rink by the library.

676
00:51:56,813 --> 00:51:59,577
And then later
I could even sell hockey equipment.

677
00:51:59,649 --> 00:52:01,640
- <i>Look, Chris...</i>
- You're saying no.

678
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:04,710
- <i>Yes.</i>
- Did you say yes?

679
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:09,350
- No, you can't have the goddamn money.
- Robert.

680
00:52:09,426 --> 00:52:12,657
- Look, Chris...
- Dad, that's fine. I understand.

681
00:52:13,497 --> 00:52:16,432
- Hey, buddy, can I ask you a question?
- <i>Go ahead.</i>

682
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,491
- Do you wanna come home?
- What?

683
00:52:18,568 --> 00:52:22,470
You don't have to be afraid to ask.
The door is always open for you here.

684
00:52:22,539 --> 00:52:24,530
I gotta go, Dad.

685
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:31,637
<i>[Chris] Once upon a time, I woke up.</i>

686
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:36,180
<i>I took a shower with soap.</i>

687
00:52:38,455 --> 00:52:42,619
<i>I skipped breakfast</i>
<i>so that I could follow an armored car.</i>

688
00:52:48,565 --> 00:52:51,056
<i>I cased the Noel Town bank.</i>

689
00:53:03,413 --> 00:53:07,406
<i>I rented an acetylene tank</i>
<i>for the cutting torch.</i>

<i>[Tires screeching]</i>

<i>Cork and I went car shopping.</i>

<i>And then I took pictures of the vault.</i>

[Knocking]

694
00:53:35,845 --> 00:53:38,279
- Ted.
- Freezing out there.

695
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:40,839
- What are you taking pictures of?
- Nothing.

696
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:42,578
I just, uh...

697
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:47,754
I just wanted to show my parents
where I work, that's all.

698
00:53:47,824 --> 00:53:50,315
Give me the camera, Chris.

699
00:53:52,996 --> 00:53:55,692
Go stand over there.

700
00:53:57,667 --> 00:54:01,660
I'm sure your parents would like
to see you in the picture.

701
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:03,262
I know mine would.

702
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:07,868
My dad one time took a video of me
giving this guy a speeding ticket.

703
00:54:07,944 --> 00:54:09,935
[Chuckles] That's my dad.

704
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:13,978
Why don't you put your hand
on the handle there? Yeah.

705
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:17,281
Yeah, that's great, that's great.
Say "Go Mustangs!"

706
00:54:18,221 --> 00:54:21,452
Vault looks like an antique
Hogue and Langehammer.

707
00:54:21,524 --> 00:54:24,687
The lock's a 1922 Moss Hamilton.

708
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:27,559
Dual custody with
a three-movement S&G time lock,

709
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:31,727
another S&G mounted vertically down,
whatever that means.

710
00:54:31,801 --> 00:54:33,792
I say we just cut through the side.

711
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:37,533
Vault's so old, it's not gonna be
wired, probably got blind spots.

712
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:41,270
Jackhammer the cement, torch the skin.

713
00:54:41,344 --> 00:54:43,972
Town's so dead
no one's gonna hear anything.

714
00:54:44,047 --> 00:54:46,277
- Cameras?
- I'm working on that.

715
00:54:46,349 --> 00:54:49,716
Chris, my number's in there.
Call the minute the money comes.

716
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:53,244
- We go in there Friday.
- That's my job? Just to call you?

717
00:54:53,323 --> 00:54:57,020
No. On the night, your job will be
to watch out for Deputy Doughnut.

718
00:54:57,093 --> 00:55:00,824
He drives by, never at the same time,
so there's no way to plan for him.

719
00:55:00,897 --> 00:55:04,958
- That's it?
- That's it? Dude, that's a lot.

720
00:55:05,035 --> 00:55:09,597
That's the most important job of all.
You're the lookout.

721
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:24,954
Hi. I'd like to exchange this, please.

722
00:55:26,456 --> 00:55:30,449
- Yeah, this is good.
- Excellent choice, sir.

723
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:37,432
- [Luvlee laughs]
- [Chris] Shh!

724
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,593
You're gonna wake up Lewis.

725
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:45,065
[Luvlee] I've never seen a blind person
up close before.

726
00:55:53,783 --> 00:55:55,876
- What...?
- Oh, that.

727
00:55:55,952 --> 00:55:59,820
They did that so I could breathe.
I was in a coma for ten days.

728
00:55:59,889 --> 00:56:02,187
Ouch.

729
00:56:02,258 --> 00:56:05,056
Do you remember?

730
00:56:05,128 --> 00:56:08,495
I just remember I opened my eyes,

731
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:12,934
I saw my dad sitting there,
and I go, "I love you, Boomer."

732
00:56:13,002 --> 00:56:15,061
And then he starts crying.

733
00:56:15,138 --> 00:56:19,370
- You call your dad Boomer?
- No, that's the name of my first dog.

734
00:56:22,245 --> 00:56:26,079
Yeah. He was a hunting dog.
He was a Chesapeake Bay retriever.

735
00:56:26,149 --> 00:56:28,709
The only one in the world
that couldn't swim.

736
00:56:28,785 --> 00:56:31,686
- You used to shoot birds?
- Ducks, geese, and deer.

737
00:56:31,755 --> 00:56:34,019
With my dad and my idiot brother.

738
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:39,926
- And you liked doing that?
- No. But I was good at it.

739
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:42,591
What a surprise.

740
00:56:45,335 --> 00:56:47,030
I'm gonna kiss it better.

741
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:14,128
Luvlee, I presume.
I recognize the perfume.

742
00:57:14,197 --> 00:57:17,655
Can I offer you some pie?
It's not homemade, but it's decent.

743
00:57:17,734 --> 00:57:18,860
No, thank you.

744
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:21,870
Probably gotta watch your figure,
your line of work.

745
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:25,237
Nice name, by the way. Luvlee Lemons.

746
00:57:25,308 --> 00:57:29,301
I don't dance anymore.
I was never very good at it.

747
00:57:33,049 --> 00:57:37,884
Please tell me you're not waving
your hand in front of my face.

748
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:40,923
Sorry. Have you been blind
your whole life?

749
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:43,618
- Most of it, yeah.
- How'd it happen?

750
00:57:43,693 --> 00:57:47,356
- I looked at the sun too long.
- Wow. You hear about that...

751
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:50,126
Let me ask you a question.
What's your real name?

752
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:53,897
- Why? Are you gonna Google me?
- I did, what would I find?

753
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:57,963
- Probably nothing.
- And what happens if I Google Gary?

754
00:57:58,041 --> 00:57:59,668
How'd you meet Chris?

755
00:57:59,742 --> 00:58:02,302
Center put us together
a few years ago.

756
00:58:02,378 --> 00:58:05,108
- Now he's your best friend?
- He's a good friend.

757
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:07,445
Maybe your only friend, huh?

758
00:58:07,517 --> 00:58:09,576
That thing I said about the sun?

759
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:13,144
That's a lie. Total bullshit.
I was about your age.

760
00:58:13,223 --> 00:58:16,784
Some buddies and me wanted to make
money, so we started a meth lab.

761
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:20,023
- You blew yourself up?
- Do I look like I blew myself up?

762
00:58:20,096 --> 00:58:23,964
No, I didn't blow myself up.

763
00:58:24,033 --> 00:58:28,231
This was a while back,
before meth was fashionable,

764
00:58:28,304 --> 00:58:30,465
so unfortunately it wasn't yet known

765
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:33,065
that if you work
in an unventilated room,

766
00:58:33,142 --> 00:58:35,474
the fumes can
and, in fact, do blind you.

767
00:58:35,545 --> 00:58:37,536
It probably could have been avoided

768
00:58:37,614 --> 00:58:43,109
if I had just stopped and bothered
to ask a simple question:

769
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:45,211
What am I doing here?

770
00:58:45,288 --> 00:58:50,624
That is a sad story.
I'm sorry... if it's true.

771
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:55,562
Tell me, what are you all cooking,
sweetheart? Why are you here?

772
00:58:55,632 --> 00:58:58,692
The same reason you are. Chris Pratt.

773
00:58:58,768 --> 00:59:03,000
Sweet. Of course,
not as sweet as meeting in a bar.

774
00:59:03,072 --> 00:59:06,508
- Or giving somebody a cell phone.
- Gary wants to help Chris.

775
00:59:06,576 --> 00:59:08,806
- I'll bet he does.
- Do you know Gary?

776
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:10,869
I've known lots of Garys.

777
00:59:10,947 --> 00:59:13,006
- A few Luvlees, too.
- Meaning?

778
00:59:13,082 --> 00:59:16,313
Meaning something tells me
that you really don't believe

779
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:19,719
you're going to be invited
to the next Pratt Thanksgiving.

780
00:59:19,789 --> 00:59:22,883
I could be.

781
00:59:22,959 --> 00:59:26,690
Sometimes I wake up and think I can see
until I walk into a door.

782
00:59:28,097 --> 00:59:32,124
The Luvlee Lemons of this world
do not end up with Chris Pratt.

783

Thank you.

784

- Asshole.
- Sad but true.

785
00:59:37,473 --> 00:59:41,842
But that brings me back
to that original question, Luvlee.

786
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:47,440
So tonight, in the dark,
I'm gonna help you out and ask it again.

she was going into labor.

This whole Earl of Sandwich thing

- What I always have. Teriyaki burger.

we have our place, no menus.

- Medium well, extra teri on the side.

And two Cokes.

- You two are trouble, I can tell.
- Who, us? No.

- We're just having a gimps' night out.

- She sounds cute.
- Why'd you say that?

821
01:03:35,678 --> 01:03:38,146
- Because she sounds cute.
- Gimps' night out?

822
01:03:38,214 --> 01:03:42,651
- What, you don't think she noticed?
- I can do any fucking thing I want to.

823

And it's not even
night out either, stupid.

it's obnoxious.

- That waitress, the way you hit on her.

Come on. I've been turned down more
times than the beds at the Holiday Inn.

"I wanna bone that blind guy,
looks like Larry Flynt."
