00:22:05,075 --> 00:22:07,702
when they put out 35 million
pounds of grass last year?

319

Because your THC levels
are off the fucking charts.

Thirty-three.
Depends.

Yeah, and their schwag is what?
Three to five?

Come on, man. They're Wal-Mart,
man, you're Ben and Chon.

They want a Ben and Chon
section in aisle three.

Okay? What's so
difficult to comprehend?

326
00:22:25,846 --> 00:22:27,806
Fine, tell them to
move their shit indoors

327
00:22:27,931 --> 00:22:29,933
and buy their
own fucking lamps.

Well, welcome to
the recession, boys.

You should be grateful you still
have a product people want.

You have a clean business,

stays the same.

a matter of time, guys,

336
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:57,586
before they
legalize this shit.

337

Don't fuck
with Wal-Mart.

Thanks, Ben.

Yeah, that was Mexico.
This is Laguna.

That's why we're
thinking of running.

You start running,
Ben, you never stop.

Besides, there are other ways
to make money.

Don't get locked into
one view of the world, Chon.

What?

Did you know they're making $14
laptops for kids in Africa?

359
00:24:21,086 --> 00:24:23,380
What if you could
make a $10 solar panel?

360
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,048

<i>Some of it, Indian tribal land,
not subject to federal law.</i>

380
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:52,886
We have the structure

to cultivate thousands and
thousands of acres all at once.

and our seed-makers very much.

It is your methods and your
network we want to partner with.

No pun intended.

Well said.

In return, we take
a modest distribution fee.

391
00:26:26,127 --> 00:26:27,462
Which would be?

392

20%.

393
00:26:31,049 --> 00:26:33,468
80% is all yours.

00:26:37,138 --> 00:26:38,515
And after the three years?

395
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,892
We'll grow your volume.

396
00:26:41,392 --> 00:26:45,897
Your profits in three years
will be 35 to 40 million.

00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:48,691
After three years,
I'm sure you'll be pleased

and quite willing to
re-negotiate our fee.

It's hers.

948
01:03:50,369 --> 01:03:54,081
She's losing men, she's losing
money like a BP oil spill.

949
01:03:54,248 --> 01:03:58,377
That's why she's coming up and
moving in on indie guys like you.

950
01:04:00,254 --> 01:04:02,715
Where does she live?
She got a house up here?

Tijuana. And don't
even think about it.

952
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:08,471
She's got security, like, beyond
the American fucking embassy.

953
01:04:08,637 --> 01:04:10,890
Look, this is the deal.

954
01:04:11,057 --> 01:04:13,392
Husband, brothers, dead.
Two sons, dead.

955
01:04:13,559 --> 01:04:15,770
She's got a son in Mexico City.
He's some playboy, he's alive.

956
01:04:15,936 --> 01:04:17,897
A daughter, Magda, also dead.

957

And that's all
I fucking know!

This is fucking bullshit!

959
01:04:21,484 --> 01:04:23,235
We need what
the DEA's got on the cartel.

960
01:04:23,319 --> 01:04:24,737
Names, histories,
stash houses.

961
01:04:24,820 --> 01:04:26,906
But that ain't part
of the deal, buddy boy!

fucking 1984 in there, man.

Again. More fucking bullshit!
It's not bullshit!

They took our girl.

1575
01:46:43,231 --> 01:46:47,777
A man takes care of his
family, and I respect that.

1576
01:46:48,653 --> 01:46:50,822
<i>I'd like to give
you a better death.</i>

1577
01:46:51,114 --> 01:46:52,657
But it would
set a bad example.

1578
01:46:57,579 --> 01:46:59,122
No, no, no!

1579
01:47:00,498 --> 01:47:02,000
I don't like the screaming.

1580
01:47:02,167 --> 01:47:03,168
Oh, God!

1581
01:47:10,508 --> 01:47:11,926
Beach Boy.

1582
01:47:15,347 --> 01:47:17,766
No? He took your money, too.

1583
01:47:18,350 --> 01:47:21,186
<i>”La Reina”</i> says to do it.

1584
01:47:26,232 --> 01:47:27,317
Elena, please...

1585
01:47:27,400 --> 01:47:28,777
Make her watch.

1586
01:47:30,236 --> 01:47:31,363
Let me do it.

1587
01:47:32,113 --> 01:47:34,449
Not you, "Caviar."

1588
01:47:34,616 --> 01:47:36,743
It's my gift to him.

1589
01:48:52,193 --> 01:48:54,362
So, I read up on your Buddha.

1590
01:48:54,529 --> 01:48:56,114
According to the Dalai Lama,

1591
01:48:57,115 --> 01:49:00,285
if you are in a position
to prevent greater violence,

1592
01:49:00,452 --> 01:49:04,080
strike first and strike fast.

1593
01:49:06,458 --> 01:49:08,585
Alex kidnapped people, Ben.

1594
01:49:08,751 --> 01:49:11,463
He had people
tortured and killed.

1595
01:49:11,629 --> 01:49:13,798
So have we.

1596
01:49:18,761 --> 01:49:21,473
Dennis fucked us
on those files.

1597
01:49:23,433 --> 01:49:25,768
When Alex was up there,

1598
01:49:25,935 --> 01:49:30,190
he begged Elena on the head
of Magda, her daughter.

1599
01:49:30,356 --> 01:49:32,692
Which means
she must be alive.

1600
01:49:32,859 --> 01:49:35,487
And Dennis knows.

1601
01:49:35,653 --> 01:49:36,654
Yeah.

1602
01:49:36,821 --> 01:49:37,822
We're short three mil.

1603
01:49:38,865 --> 01:49:40,992
Another hit
is problematic.

1604
01:49:42,035 --> 01:49:44,787
We have got to squeeze it
out of Dennis somehow.

1605
01:49:44,954 --> 01:49:47,165
Find her and trade her.

1606
01:49:47,332 --> 01:49:49,167
You mean, "Kidnap."

1607
01:49:51,377 --> 01:49:53,171
BEN:<i> The same as O.</i>

1608
01:49:54,339 --> 01:49:56,549
You up for that?
Yeah.

1609
01:49:57,967 --> 01:49:59,636
I am.

1610
01:50:05,475 --> 01:50:07,852
Daddy, there's a man
here to see you.

1611
01:50:08,019 --> 01:50:09,187
What man?

1612
01:50:09,354 --> 01:50:10,522
I don't know.

1613
01:50:18,196 --> 01:50:20,365
I was driving by
your neighborgood

1614
01:50:20,532 --> 01:50:23,034
and noticed that your yard
needs some trimming.

1615
01:50:23,868 --> 01:50:27,080
My crew would like to give you
a free haircut today.

1616
01:50:27,830 --> 01:50:30,208
My wife usually
takes care of that stuff.

1617
01:50:31,876 --> 01:50:33,211
Sarah, Hannah,
go to your room right now.

1618
01:50:33,378 --> 01:50:34,921
But, Daddy...
No "buts," no nothing. Go.

1619
01:50:35,088 --> 01:50:36,548
Papa says, "Go."

1620
01:50:39,884 --> 01:50:43,054
Lado! You come to my house?

1621
01:50:43,221 --> 01:50:45,223
You threaten my daughters?

1622
01:50:45,390 --> 01:50:46,891
You don't think I'm
the kind of guy that

1623
01:50:47,058 --> 01:50:48,560
doesn't have cameras
all over the place?

1624
01:50:48,726 --> 01:50:50,812
It don't matter to me.

1625
01:50:50,979 --> 01:50:53,940
After I whack you and your
daughters, I'll burn the house down.

1626
01:50:54,440 --> 01:50:56,943
Come on, you found
your fucking snitch.

1627
01:50:57,110 --> 01:50:58,278
You found him.

1628
01:51:04,826 --> 01:51:06,911
What happened to your hand?

1629
01:51:07,036 --> 01:51:08,288
(ENGINE REVVING)

1630
01:51:11,082 --> 01:51:12,500
DENNIS: Got it caught
in a weed whacker.

1631
01:51:12,834 --> 01:51:13,918
Weed whacker?

1632
01:51:14,043 --> 01:51:15,128
Yeah.

1633
01:51:15,295 --> 01:51:17,463
"Weed whacker," my ass.

1634
01:51:24,137 --> 01:51:26,306
We need to have
a conversation.

1635
01:51:26,472 --> 01:51:28,641
Because I'm confused about
some of your actions, Dennis.

1636
01:51:28,808 --> 01:51:30,143
Like what?

1637
01:51:30,310 --> 01:51:32,854
Like you giving Ben and Chon
all that information.

1638
01:51:33,021 --> 01:51:34,606
You must be smoking
your own shit now, man.

1639
01:51:34,772 --> 01:51:37,191
You got to know
I'm your man.

1640
01:51:37,442 --> 01:51:39,611
I got you your
green card, okay?

1641
01:51:39,777 --> 01:51:41,613
I've been protecting you
for six fucking years.

1642
01:51:41,779 --> 01:51:43,114
Now that shit
hits the fan,

1643
01:51:43,281 --> 01:51:45,867
you got seven dead beaners, you
got a white lawyer in Laguna,

1644
01:51:46,034 --> 01:51:47,910
you need me now
more than ever.

1645
01:51:48,077 --> 01:51:49,495
Stop begging.

1646
01:51:49,787 --> 01:51:50,788
You sound like a woman.

1647
01:51:54,917 --> 01:51:58,338
Dennis,
I know you gave them stuff.

1648
01:51:59,047 --> 01:52:01,257
What makes you so goddamn
sure it's not Azul?

1649
01:52:01,424 --> 01:52:02,425
Because I know it wasn't him.

1650
01:52:02,508 --> 01:52:03,551
What do you mean?

1651
01:52:03,635 --> 01:52:05,178
Because I'm working
with him now, <i>anfibio.</i>

1652
01:52:05,261 --> 01:52:06,262
What?

1653
01:52:06,346 --> 01:52:07,639
And you lie to
me one more time,

1654
01:52:07,764 --> 01:52:09,057
motherfucker,
I will shoot you down.

1655
01:52:09,223 --> 01:52:11,059
Since when have you
been working with Azul?

1656
01:52:11,225 --> 01:52:12,602
You're not going
to tell me that?

1657
01:52:14,812 --> 01:52:16,105
Since two days ago.

1658
01:52:20,985 --> 01:52:24,280
I never gave them you, Lado.
They had me.

1659
01:52:24,447 --> 01:52:28,159
I'd be out of business.
I'd be useless to you.

1660
01:52:28,868 --> 01:52:32,830
I never thought this Iraq psycho
would go nuts on you guys.

1661
01:52:33,122 --> 01:52:35,583
I never gave you up, ever!

1662
01:52:36,334 --> 01:52:39,379
I'm your best friend
on this side, man.

1663
01:52:40,213 --> 01:52:41,881
Did you tell them I
was your little snitch?

1664
01:52:42,048 --> 01:52:44,133
What are you, crazy?
What would be in it for me?

1665
01:52:44,217 --> 01:52:45,259
Answer me, Dennis.

1666
01:52:45,343 --> 01:52:47,887
I gave them enough to just get
them off my fucking ass...

1667
01:52:48,054 --> 01:52:49,347
Yes or no?
No!

1668
01:52:49,514 --> 01:52:52,016
No, okay? No. No.

1669
01:52:52,934 --> 01:52:56,020
It's all about you and me,
and that's it!

1670
01:52:56,187 --> 01:52:58,564
You have got to
believe me this time, man.

1671
01:52:59,774 --> 01:53:02,443
I don't want to
lose this shit!

1672
01:53:02,610 --> 01:53:05,113
I got two fucking kids
and a wife that's dying.

1673
01:53:06,072 --> 01:53:09,534
Thank you, Dennis.
Now they got my $3 million.

1674
01:53:09,701 --> 01:53:10,952
And I want that money.

1675
01:53:11,119 --> 01:53:13,079
It's my money! It's my money!

1676
01:53:13,246 --> 01:53:15,540
Fuckers. You can't trust
anybody no more. Fuck!

1677
01:53:15,707 --> 01:53:18,501
I can't even
trust my fucking wife.

1678
01:53:18,668 --> 01:53:20,545
She's looking to
divorce me, you know?

1679
01:53:21,796 --> 01:53:25,174
My wife's barely breathing.
Welcome to midlife crisis, buddy.

1680
01:53:25,341 --> 01:53:28,136
How do you know you can
trust this Azul guy?

1681
01:53:28,302 --> 01:53:29,345
I mean, come on.

1682
01:53:29,429 --> 01:53:31,973
Has he given you a piece of the business?
Is that what he promised you?

1683
01:53:32,140 --> 01:53:34,684
Because Elena is not
going to fold that easy.

1684
01:53:34,851 --> 01:53:36,519
You know, that three
million is her money.

1685
01:53:36,686 --> 01:53:38,646
Now, don't be a knucklehead.
Think.

1686
01:53:38,855 --> 01:53:41,858
Fuck you.
You think, you fucked it up.

1687
01:53:42,024 --> 01:53:43,359
How are you going to
get me back my money?

1688
01:53:43,443 --> 01:53:44,444
(STAMMERS)

1689
01:53:45,194 --> 01:53:47,280
You need me. I'm going
to get you your money.

1690
01:53:47,447 --> 01:53:49,741
But they need the girl.
The guys want this girl.

1691
01:53:49,907 --> 01:53:51,617
They're in fucking love
with this chick.

1692
01:53:51,784 --> 01:53:55,329
And they want O, okay?
So, where is she?

1693
01:53:56,581 --> 01:53:58,040
I don't have her.

1694
01:53:58,207 --> 01:53:59,834
What do you mean,
you "don't have her"?

1695
01:54:00,001 --> 01:54:01,419
Where is she?

1696
01:54:01,836 --> 01:54:02,837
With Elena.

1697
01:54:03,004 --> 01:54:04,005
In Mexico?

1698
01:54:04,172 --> 01:54:05,465
No, here.
Here?

1699
01:54:05,631 --> 01:54:07,091
Some fucking
Indian reservation.

1700
01:54:07,258 --> 01:54:08,718
Elena came to
see her daughter.

1701
01:54:08,885 --> 01:54:11,846
An now that woman is in my face,
telling me what to do, provoking me.

1702
01:54:12,013 --> 01:54:14,390
Oh, this is big, man.

1703
01:54:14,557 --> 01:54:16,476
<i>”La Reina"</i> Elena
is on US soil?

1704
01:54:16,642 --> 01:54:18,853
I told you, it's Indian land.
She's protected.

1705
01:54:19,020 --> 01:54:22,315
And I'm going to fix that. That's
why you need Dennis. Think.

1706
01:54:22,607 --> 01:54:24,442
Stop telling me to think.
No, no, no, man.

1707
01:54:24,525 --> 01:54:26,861
Look, these guys,
they got the three million.

1708
01:54:27,028 --> 01:54:28,279
What do you think
they're going to do with it?

1709
01:54:28,446 --> 01:54:31,365
They're going to fucking
give it to Elena, right?

1710
01:54:31,741 --> 01:54:35,411
And we, first, are going to
sell them Elena's daughter.

1711
01:54:35,578 --> 01:54:38,331
We split the profits,
and then we fuck Elena!

1712
01:54:38,414 --> 01:54:39,415
Fuck her!

1713
01:54:42,210 --> 01:54:44,420
Do you understand?

1714
01:54:46,130 --> 01:54:47,131
Whoa!

was one step ahead.</i>

I'd like to blow
your fucking heads off.

1718

They threatened my daughters.
My daughters!

1719
01:55:07,944 --> 01:55:09,654
Enough with the whining.

1720
01:55:09,821 --> 01:55:12,156
You deserve every fucking
inch of your pain, asshole.

1721
01:55:12,281 --> 01:55:13,324
You gave us up.

1722

Like I had a choice.

1723
01:55:14,992 --> 01:55:17,829
You could have gone along.
You would have made big money.

1724

But you had to pull
your Iraq GI Jack shit.

1725

We want Magda.

1726

Ask your smart-ass boy, here.
SEAL boy, hey.

1727
01:55:25,795 --> 01:55:27,171
Did you figure it out
from the transcripts?

All the calls
to Orange County?
