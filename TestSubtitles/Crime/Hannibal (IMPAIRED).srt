BARNEY: Sometimes

2
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:43,792
Dr. Lecter and I would talk,
when things got quiet enough,

3
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:46,003
about the science courses
I was taking, and...

4
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:49,840
CORDELL: Some kind of mail-order courses
in psychology, Nurse Barney?

5
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:51,300
No, sir.

6
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:55,888
See, I don't consider psychology a science,
and neither did Dr. Lecter.

Now, Barney,
while you were working at the asylum,

9
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:09,151
you observed Clarice Starling
and Hannibal Lecter interacting.

10
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:11,945
Interacting?

11
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,782
CORDELL: Talking to one another.

12
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:17,743
Yes. Yes, it seemed to me that they...

13
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:21,288
I can see you're eager to justify
your consulting fee,

14
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:24,124
but why don't we start
with what you saw,

15
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:26,668
not what you thought
about what you saw?

16
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,545
VERGER: Cordell, don't be like that.

17
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,923
Barney can give us his opinion.

18
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:34,843
Barney, give us your opinion
of what you saw.

19

What was it between them?

20
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,599
Well, most of the time,

21
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:43,685
Dr. Lecter didn't respond at all to visitors.

22
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:45,312
He'd just, for instance,

23
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:48,148
open his eyes long enough
to insult some academic

24
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:50,526
who was there to look over him.

25
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:53,904
With Starling, he answered her questions.

26
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:57,366
She interested him. She intrigued him.

27
00:01:57,867 --> 00:02:00,828
He thought she was charming
and amusing.

28
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:07,042
So, Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter
became friendly?

29
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:11,922
Well, inside a kind of formal structure, yes.

30
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:15,134
And he was fond of her?

31
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,388
Yes.

of celebrity 10 years ago,

00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,615
It's gonna be a hell of a lot harder to do
with a combative attitude.

160
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,366
(PAGER BEEPING)

161
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:10,747
Can I speak freely, Mr. Pearsall?

162
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,125
Your agency called this office

163
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,127
to get me assigned
to help you on this raid.

164
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,879
I tried to do that.

165
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:21,049
I clearly expressed my judgment,
and was ignored,

166
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:24,093
and now a good agent,
and a friend, is dead.

167
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,849
You shot and killed five people out there,
Agent Starling.

168
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,268
Is that how you define good judgment?

169
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,355
This raid was an ugly mess.

170
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:38,525
I ended up in a position
where I had a choice of dying,

171
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,568
or shooting a woman carrying a child.

172
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,487
I chose.

173
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:44,781
I shot her.

174
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:48,076
I killed a mother holding her child.

175
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,914
And I regret it, I resent myself for it.

176
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,416
All right, gentlemen,
I'm going to call a halt to this meeting

177
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:58,336
and get back to you individually by phone.

178
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,092
Waste of time.

179
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,179
You have a secret admirer, Starling.

180
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:12,183
Isn't much to look at,
but he does have friends in high places.

181
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,936
Remember Mason Verger?

182
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,981
Lecter's fourth victim,

183
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,149
the rich one.

184
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,985
The only one that survived.

185
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:26,781
He says he has some new information
on Lecter. He'll only share it with you.

186
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,659
CLARICE: What do you mean, only share it
with me? You want it, seize it.

187
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:31,286
We'd rather not.

188
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:33,413
I wasn't speaking to you, Mr. Krendler.

189
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:37,292
When I speak to you,
you'll know it, because I'll look at you.

190
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,127
Why would we rather not?

191
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,461
The last time he called

192
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:43,882
was when we took Lecter off
the Ten Most Wanted list.

193
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:46,801
He was upset about that.
We said, "Hey, that's life."

194
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,971
He said, "Hey, this is
a Senate oversight committee,

195
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,056
"to make your life miserable."

196
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:56,311
His family's political contributions
may not be enough to buy a senator,

197
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:59,147
but they are enough to rent them
from time to time.

198
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:04,110
There's no reason to go through that again
if he really does have something new.

199
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:09,782
KRENDLER: It's a good deal for you,
Starling. You can't pretend it isn't.

200
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,452
You get to go back on a celebrated case.

201
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:15,830
I'll take care of the media
for your Drumgo killing.

202
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:19,208
-Everyone's gonna be happy.
-I'm not happy.

203
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:23,171
Well, maybe you're incapable
of being happy.

204
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:28,092
Mr. Krendler,
when you're out on the street,

205
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,261
you know you might take
a bullet in the line of duty.

206
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,680
You accept it, or you get out.

207
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,432
You live with it.

208
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:37,226
What you don't expect, or accept,

209
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,979
is taking one in the back
in your boss' office

210
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,357
for doing your job
exactly as they've taught you.

211
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,525
That makes you unhappy.

212
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:49,197
Of course, you're right, Starling,
but it doesn't really change anything.

213
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:51,866
It changes everything. It changes me.

214
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,585
Agent Starling, hi.

215
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:47,130
I'm Cordell Doemling,
Mr. Verger's private physician.

216
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,381
How do you do?

217
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,842
If you'd be so kind
as to park down at the end.

218
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:53,594
(BEES BUZZING)

219
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,934
One's eyes adjust to the darkness.

220
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,525
NEWSREADER ON TV: ...versus
an estimate of 16.

221
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,444
Dylan, they're saying sales
have slowed down.

222
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:10,737
Seems like a recurring theme here.

223
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:14,282
Perhaps corporate spending
on a slowdown...

224
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:18,119
CORDELL: Mr. Verger,
Agent Starling is here.

225
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:20,955
Good morning, Mr. Verger.

226
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:24,375
VERGER: Was that a Mustang
I heard out there?

227
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,752
Yes, it was.

228
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,795
-A five liter?
-CLARICE: Yes.

229
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,423
Fast.

230
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,801
Cordell, I think you can leave us now.

231
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:38,806
I thought I might stay.
Perhaps I could be useful.

232
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:42,226
You could be useful
seeing about my lunch.

233
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:48,983
I'd like to attach this microphone

234
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:51,319
to your clothing or your pillow,
if you're comfortable with that.

235
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,237
Oh, by all means.

236
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,995
Here, this should make it easier.

237
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,881
You know, I thank God for what happened.

238
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,425
It was my salvation.

239
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,888
Have you accepted Jesus, Agent Starling?

240
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:22,183
-Do you have faith?
-I was raised Lutheran.

241
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,268
That's not what I asked.

242
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:28,481
This is Special Agent Clarice Starling,
5-1 -4-3-6-9-0,

243
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:31,192
deposing Mason R. Verger
on March 20, sworn and attested...

244
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,860
-I wanna tell you about summer camp.
-Mr. Verger...

245
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:35,321
-It was a wonderful childhood experience.
-We can get to that later.

246
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,198
No, we can get to it now.

247
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,618
You see, it all comes to bear.

248
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:44,497
It was a Christian camp my father founded

249
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:49,544
for poor, unfortunate,
castoff little boys and girls

250
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,296
who would do anything for a candy bar.

251
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,715
Mr. Verger, I don't need to know
about the sex offenses,

252
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,175
-I just have to...
-No, it's all right.

253
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,469
I have immunity from the U.S. Attorneys,

254
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:02,223
and I have an immunity
from the Risen Jesus.

255
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:06,227
And nobody beats the Riz.

256
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:08,563
Had you ever seen Dr. Lecter

257
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,565
before the court assigned you
to him for therapy?

258
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:12,233
What do you mean?

259
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,734
Socially?

260
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,153
(CHUCKLES)

261
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,612
That is what I mean.

262
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,739
Yes, if you don't mind talking about it.

263
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:21,242
-Oh, not at all. I'm not ashamed.
-I didn't say you should be.

264
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:25,496
No. We met conventionally,
as doctor and patient.

265
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,832
How did he end up at your house?

266
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,501
I invited him, of course.

267
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:34,422
To my pied-à-terre.

268
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:39,260
I came to the door
in my nicest "come hither" outfit.

269
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:43,306
I was concerned he'd be afraid of me,

270
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:47,310
but he didn't seem to be afraid of me.

271
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,063
That's almost funny now.

272
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:57,695
I showed him my toys,
my noose setup, among other things.

273
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:02,074
It's a way you sort of hang yourself,
but not really.

274
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,410
It feels good while you...

275
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:06,662
Well, you know.

276
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:10,750
Anyway, he said, "Mason..."

277
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:13,294
Mason, would you like a popper?

278
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:15,963
And I said, "Would l?

279
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:20,134
"Oh, wow."
Once that kicked in, I was flying.

280
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:24,180
He said, "Mason, show me how you smile

281
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:26,807
"to gain the confidence of a child."

282
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,853
Then I smiled.

283
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:34,148
He said, "Oh, I see how you do it."

284
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:38,319
The good doctor approached me
with a piece of broken mirror.

285
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,238
"Try this."

286
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:42,990
Try peeling off your face.

287
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:46,410
"And feeding it to the dogs."

288
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:57,338
LECTER: No. I can still see it.

289
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,007
Try again.

290
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:02,218
No, I'm afraid not.

291
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:06,305
That's entertainment!

292
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,807
(LAUGHING)

293
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,269
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

294
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:17,066
Mr. Verger, you indicated to me that you'd
received some kind of new information.

295
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,028
Cordell.

296
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,837
Where did this come from?

297
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:40,923
Buenos Aires. I received it two weeks ago.

298
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,719
Where is the package it came in?

299
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,138
Good question.

300
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:49,473
There was nothing written
on it of interest.

301
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,726
Cordell, did we throw it out?

302
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:54,061
Yes, I'm afraid we did.

303
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,480
Oh, dear. You think it'll help?

304
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,566
I hope so.

305
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,610
I hope it'll help you catch him,

306
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:05,406
to help cleanse the stigma
of your recent dishonor.

307
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:07,867
Thank you. I think that's all I need.

308
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:10,911
Did you find some rapport with Dr. Lecter,

309
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,164
in your talks at the asylum?

310
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:17,251
I know I did, while I was peeling.

311
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:20,463
We exchanged information in a civil way.

312
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:24,008
-But always through the glass?
-Yes.

313
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,937
Isn't it funny?

314
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:38,939
What's that?

315
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:41,275
You can look at my face,

the name of God.

That's all there is now. There was more,

320

but it's been picked over
little by little over the years.

You know, this stuff's worth
a lot of money in certain circles.

322

It's kind of like the cocaine
that disappears around here,

Hey, Barney.

330
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,663
Remember me?

331
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:03,083
Would you agree for the record,
Agent Starling,

332
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:05,544
that I've not been read my rights?

333
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:11,050
I have not Mirandized Barney.

334
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:13,260
He is unaware of his rights.

335
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,932
So, when you turned Dr. Lecter over
to the Tennessee police...

336
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:21,268
They weren't civil to him.
They're all dead now.

337
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:24,438
Yeah, they only survived his company
three days.

338
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:27,316
You survived him six years at the asylum.

339
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:30,611
How'd you do that?
It wasn't just being civil.

340
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,613
Yes, it was.

341
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,991
Did you ever think after he escaped
he might come after you?

342
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:39,787
No. He once told me
that whenever feasible,

343
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:42,456
he preferred to eat the rude.

344
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:45,251
"Free-range rude," he called them.

345
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:48,629
What about you?
You ever think he might come after you?

346

You ever think about him at all?

His books, papers, drawings...

Everything got thrown away
when the place closed. Cutbacks.

that Dr. Lecter's signed copy

It was probably a fake.

The seller's affidavit of ownership
was signed Karen Phlox.

Do you know Karen Phlox? You should.

358
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:26,458
She filled out your

00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:29,420
only at the bottom, she signed it "Barney."

Maybe I can get it back.

-I didn't say you were.

After your first visit,

00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:23,599
he started taping
your conversations with Dr. Lecter.

And what'd he say?

378
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:47,456
What'd he say about me, late at night?

379
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:51,085
Well, he was talking about inherited,
hard-wired behavior.

380
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:54,254
He was using genetics
in the roller pigeons as an example.

of being incarcerated,

475

476

In our discussions down in the dungeon,

477
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,086
it was apparent to me that your father,

478
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:09,629
the dead night watchman,

479
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:12,299
figures largely in your value system.

480
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:18,055
I think your success in putting an end
to Jame Gumb's career as a couturier,

481
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:22,517
pleased you most because you could
imagine your father being pleased.

482
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:25,979
But now, alas,
you're in bad odor with the FBI.

483
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:29,900
Do you imagine your daddy being shamed
by your disgrace?

484
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:34,237
Do you see him in his plain pine box
crushed by your failure?

485
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:37,240
The sorry,
petty end of a promising career?

486
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:41,620
What is worst
about this humiliation, Clarice?

487
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:45,457
Is it how your failure
will reflect on your mommy and daddy?

488
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:49,461
Is your worst fear
that people will now and forever

489
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,129
believe they were, indeed,

490
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:54,758
just good old trailer-camp,
tornado-bait, white trash,

491
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,344
and that perhaps you are, too?

492
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:04,309
By the way, I couldn't help noticing
on the FBI's rather dull public website,

493
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,019
that I have been hoisted

494
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,939
from the Bureau's archives
of the common criminal,

495
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:12,651
and elevated to the more prestigious

Special Agent Clarice Starling,
a 10-year veteran on the Bureau,

01:26:51,581 --> 01:26:52,998
began her career with an assignment

decision at this morning's meeting?

1120
01:27:04,135 --> 01:27:08,138
The FBI and the Justice Department
are looking very carefully into the charges,

1121
01:27:08,223 --> 01:27:10,432
and, yes, they're extremely serious.

a personal note, though.

1123
01:27:12,310 --> 01:27:14,978
Starling is one of the best agents
that we have.

1124

No, no, no. Stay. Stay.

Well, roller pigeons climb high and fast,

then roll over and fall
just as fast towards the earth.
