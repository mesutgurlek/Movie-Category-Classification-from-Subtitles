...l took on two or three cases
for every one I gave away.

They go in for their mother's
maiden name a lot.

Well, my mother

I do. But l--

And do you wish to enter
a plea at this time?

Yes, not guilty. But I also want to waive
my right to counsel and represent myself.

Surely you won't have trouble

Mr. Crawford...

...you're facing some
very serious charges here.

I strongly urge you to retain counsel.

That's very kind,
but I believe l'm within my rights.

Mr. Crawford to....

To get a competent attorney
to try and negotiate a plea.

00:48:23,526 --> 00:48:26,695
He had my witness list
and he should've filed to suppress.

629
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:29,739
-My mistake, I'm sorry.
-Mr. Crawford, you were warned.

630
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:33,493
-You don't get to use that as an excuse.
-What about the fact that it's true?

631
00:48:33,661 --> 00:48:36,329
I mean, isn't that the point here,
to get to the truth?

632
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:38,415
Mr. Beachum, is it true?

633
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:42,711
I have no idea, Your Honor.
I just heard about it five minutes ago.

634
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:45,755
Put him back on the witness stand,
if you don't believe me.

635
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:47,465
This is getting out of hand.

636
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:51,011
Now, he just provoked my witness
with an outrageous allegation.

637
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:52,804
My dick has evidence.

638
00:48:52,972 --> 00:48:55,056
-Excuse me?
-My dick, my private investigator.

639
00:48:55,224 --> 00:48:58,226
I call him dick. Perhaps I should call him
as a rebuttal witness.

640
00:48:58,394 --> 00:49:02,230
Because since the tragedy, he's dug up
hotel records and witnesses...

641
00:49:02,398 --> 00:49:05,567
...that confirm that my wife
and Mr. Nunally were having an affair.

642
00:49:05,735 --> 00:49:09,321
-My dick is good.
-Your Honor, so, what if he was?

643
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:11,281
ROBlNSON: Mr. Beachum.
-Even if he was--

644
00:49:11,449 --> 00:49:13,450
Your witness was intimate
with the victim...

645
00:49:13,618 --> 00:49:16,703
...and assaulted the defendant
during the arrest.

646
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:19,998
Actually, while trying to obtain
my so-called confession.

647
00:49:20,166 --> 00:49:23,209
-Yes.
-Oh, come on.

648
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:25,211
Is that a legal argument,
"Oh, come on"?

649
00:49:26,005 --> 00:49:28,465
Don't make me come across this table
because l will--

650
00:49:28,633 --> 00:49:30,842
He dictated
and signed his confession...

651
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:33,428
...at the station
long after the incident, all right?

652
00:49:33,596 --> 00:49:35,722
In fear for my life,
since my wife's lover...

653
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:39,768
...who had just beaten me,
was in the room with his friends...

654
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:41,227
...and the other officers.

655
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:44,773
Was Detective Nunally present
during Mr. Crawford's interrogation?

656
00:49:49,737 --> 00:49:51,237
He may have been, I don't know.

657
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:55,367
Because if that is indeed the case,
the confessions, both of them, are out.

658
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:58,662
If Nunally was there,
Mr. Crawford was under duress.

659
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:01,456
Confessions and evidence gathered
with Nunally present...

660
00:50:01,624 --> 00:50:04,417
...will have to be excluded
as fruit of the poisonous tree.

661
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:06,670
-This is insane.
-That's the Bible, isn't it?

662
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:10,882
"The fruit of the tree" and all that?
It's Matthew. Or is it Mark?

663
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:13,343
He set all this up.

664
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:16,471
-This is a setup.
-l'm sorry, Mr. Beachum...

665
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:19,974
...but l am not going to allow
coerced confessions in my courtroom.

666
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:21,601
Do you think I could go home...

667
00:50:21,769 --> 00:50:24,312
-...with Thanksgiving around the corner?
-Unbelievable.

668
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,147
Don't push it, Mr. Crawford.

669
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:29,693
What l'll do is I'm going to give
Mr. Beachum a few days...

670
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:34,739
...to come up with some new evidence.
If he can't, then maybe you can go home.

671
00:50:34,907 --> 00:50:39,160
So we will reconvene
on Monday morning.

What, are they open early
the day after Thanksgiving?

684
00:51:23,122 --> 00:51:26,332
My witness lied to me.

685
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,210
Yes, because he could.
Because you weren't looking.

And l know why.

Your head was in the fast lane

You picked that and what we do
is not important anymore.

-Hey, you be very careful.

01:43:35,459 --> 01:43:38,336
I know exactly
what you mean because...

1248
01:43:39,672 --> 01:43:41,715
...l got the bullet.

1249
01:43:45,219 --> 01:43:47,470
The one in your wife's head.

1250
01:43:47,722 --> 01:43:50,348
That one we couldn't take out
as long as she was alive.

1251
01:43:52,268 --> 01:43:56,396
I'm pretty sure it's gonna match Nunally's
and that gives me the murder weapon.

1252
01:44:03,529 --> 01:44:06,031
Nicely done, Willy.

1253
01:44:07,909 --> 01:44:09,576
Truly.

1254
01:44:23,090 --> 01:44:25,926
A regular chain of evidence.

1255
01:44:26,093 --> 01:44:28,178
Great stuff.

1256
01:44:28,387 --> 01:44:30,013
Vivid.

1257
01:44:30,181 --> 01:44:31,932
Heartbreaking.

1258
01:44:32,350 --> 01:44:35,852
The victim cries out
from beyond the grave.

1259
01:44:37,438 --> 01:44:41,441
Yeah. Jurors love all that sort of crap,
don't they?

1260
01:44:41,859 --> 01:44:44,110
I bet you don't even need
a confession anymore...

1261
01:44:44,278 --> 01:44:46,404
...do you, Willy?

1262
01:44:47,031 --> 01:44:51,201
I tell you what, though, old sport.
Let's make you a new one just in case.

1263
01:44:51,369 --> 01:44:54,621
The real deal, all the juicy details.

1264
01:44:55,873 --> 01:44:59,209
You can get your rocks off on that,
then, can't you? Huh?

1265
01:45:00,836 --> 01:45:02,379
Yeah.

1266
01:45:05,466 --> 01:45:09,469
I shot my wife in the face, right there.

1267
01:45:09,762 --> 01:45:12,180
She didn't look so pretty after that.

1268
01:45:12,348 --> 01:45:14,766
And l stood there
looking down at her...

1269
01:45:14,934 --> 01:45:18,561
...and l watched her eyes go all empty.

1270
01:45:18,729 --> 01:45:21,189
I could smell the blood and the shit.

1271
01:45:23,067 --> 01:45:26,069
Smelled like metal.
And the look on his face.

1272
01:45:26,237 --> 01:45:29,698
He was trying to get her back to life
and l was pissing myself laughing...

1273
01:45:29,865 --> 01:45:34,869
...because I took both the bastards out
with one fucking bullet.

1274
01:45:37,456 --> 01:45:39,082
Yeah.

1275
01:45:39,834 --> 01:45:42,168
And now you've got your
little bullet, haven't you?

1276
01:45:42,336 --> 01:45:44,045
Got what you want.

1277
01:45:44,213 --> 01:45:47,507
So bring it all on, kiddo.
Bring it all into court.

1278
01:45:47,675 --> 01:45:51,302
Except you can't.

1279
01:45:51,470 --> 01:45:53,263
Can you?

1280
01:45:54,265 --> 01:45:57,434
Let's see, now, first year law,
double jeopardy.

1281
01:45:57,601 --> 01:46:00,353
I went to trial, you lost.
Oh, pity about that.

1282
01:46:00,521 --> 01:46:03,940
It doesn't matter what you do now.

1283
01:46:04,108 --> 01:46:06,443
It doesn't matter what you know.

1284
01:46:06,610 --> 01:46:09,320
I mean, she could come back
from the dead, you see...

1285
01:46:09,488 --> 01:46:12,991
...and testify, spill the beans,
and it would mean...

1286
01:46:13,159 --> 01:46:14,576
...nothing.

1287
01:46:19,874 --> 01:46:24,127
So you can't touch me...

1288
01:46:25,254 --> 01:46:26,755
...ever.

1289
01:46:38,184 --> 01:46:40,310
She was alive.

1290
01:46:48,944 --> 01:46:53,198
When you first went to trial
for attempted murder...

1291
01:46:53,365 --> 01:46:56,076
...your wife was still alive.

1292
01:46:58,871 --> 01:47:02,207
But you just had to pull that plug,
didn't you?

1293
01:47:05,628 --> 01:47:07,504
Well, now she's dead,
and that's murder.

1294
01:47:07,671 --> 01:47:11,633
That's homicide, first degree,
and that's new charges.

1295
01:47:11,801 --> 01:47:14,135
That's new evidence.

1296
01:47:15,846 --> 01:47:17,931
That's a new trial.

1297
01:47:23,687 --> 01:47:26,689
Get the fuck out of my house.

1298
01:47:29,527 --> 01:47:31,111
All right.

1299
01:47:35,574 --> 01:47:38,451
I just don't know
why you didn't let it go.

1300
01:47:41,163 --> 01:47:42,455
The doctor said...

1301
01:47:42,623 --> 01:47:45,333
...she probably would have
outlived us all.

1302
01:48:19,076 --> 01:48:20,118
BAlLIFF:
All rise.

1303
01:48:23,664 --> 01:48:25,373
The Superior Court of Los Angeles...

1304
01:48:25,541 --> 01:48:28,543
...People of the State of California
v. Theodore Crawford.

1305
01:48:29,503 --> 01:48:32,797
The Honorable
Judge Joseph Pincus presiding.

1306
01:48:36,135 --> 01:48:37,177
Looking good.

1307
01:48:43,475 --> 01:48:45,685
Are the People ready, Mr. Beachum?

1308
01:48:48,272 --> 01:48:49,314
Very well.

1309
01:48:49,481 --> 01:48:52,233
We will now proceed
with opening statements.

1310
01:48:52,401 --> 01:48:55,862
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury....

1311
01:53:23,380 --> 01:53:25,381
