is that a.45 got a serious

00:12:06,108 --> 00:12:09,168
- <i>That's Winston. He works here.</i>
- <i>Damn.!</i>

146
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:12,008
He's a big 'un, ain't he?
Y'all tight?

147
00:12:12,114 --> 00:12:15,140
- Yeah.
- But you're his boss, though, right?

148
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,842
Yeah.

149
00:12:16,985 --> 00:12:19,681
Bet it was your idea to take
that picture, too, wasn't it?

150
00:12:22,057 --> 00:12:24,992
All right,
you want a $10,000 bond?

151
00:12:25,127 --> 00:12:28,824
- What have you got
to put up for collateral?
- I'm gonna have to use cash.

152
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:33,128
- <i>You have it with you?</i>
- Got it right here in my rapper bag.

153
00:12:33,201 --> 00:12:36,398
- You have cash. What do you need me for?
- <i>Come on, man.</i>

154
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:38,405
You know how they do.

155
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:42,409
Black man show up with 10,000 cash,
first thing they wanna know is
where I got it.

156
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:45,969
Then they gonna want
to keep a big chunk of it,
start talkin' that court-cost shit.

157
00:12:46,081 --> 00:12:48,606
Fuck that noise, Jack.
I go through you.

158
00:12:48,717 --> 00:12:51,185
Cost you a thousand
for the bond.

159
00:12:51,286 --> 00:12:53,880
I can do that.

160
00:12:54,022 --> 00:12:56,217
Who's it for?
A relative?

161
00:12:56,325 --> 00:12:58,691
A fellow named Beaumont.
They got him down in County.

162
00:12:58,794 --> 00:13:02,093
Started out drunk driving,
but they wrote it up
as possession of a concealed weapon.

163
00:13:02,197 --> 00:13:05,997
- Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.
- Ten thousand sounds high.

164
00:13:06,068 --> 00:13:08,901
<i>They run his name, got a hit.</i>
<i>He been inside.</i>

165
00:13:09,004 --> 00:13:11,495
Plus, he from Kentucky, and I think
they're kind of prejudiced...

166
00:13:11,606 --> 00:13:14,575
against brothers
from down South out here.

167
00:13:14,676 --> 00:13:17,941
If he runs, and I have to go
to Kentucky to bring him back,

168
00:13:18,046 --> 00:13:19,946
you pay the expenses.

169
00:13:20,048 --> 00:13:22,278
You think you can do that?

170
00:13:22,417 --> 00:13:26,114
I've done it.
What's his full name?

171
00:13:26,254 --> 00:13:28,984
Beaumont.
That's all I know.

172
00:13:31,593 --> 00:13:34,721
Would you say that Beaumont
is his first or his last name?

173
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:38,459
Uh, if I had to guess,
I'd say Beaumont's his Christian name.

174
00:13:38,533 --> 00:13:41,798
- [Ringing]
- Records office.

175
00:13:43,505 --> 00:13:46,702
Hello, this is Max Cherry,
Cherry Bail Bonds. Who's this, please?

176
00:13:46,808 --> 00:13:49,641
- Ordell, I'm gonna wait in the car.
- <i>Hi, Vicki.</i>

177
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:52,737
All right, man. Cool.
We're almost done here, right?

178
00:13:52,848 --> 00:13:55,646
- Gettin' there.
- Yo, yo.

179
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:59,653
You check out some music while you're
sitting in the car. Take the keys.

180
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:02,918
- Which one's for the car?
- Uh, this one right here.

181
00:14:03,024 --> 00:14:06,516
Use that little black thing to turn off
the alarm and unlock the door.

182
00:14:06,628 --> 00:14:08,858
- What do I do?
- You ain't gotta do nothing, man.

183
00:14:08,964 --> 00:14:11,524
Just point it at the car, push the
button, you hear a little "ooh-ooh-ooh."

184
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,900
- That means the door's unlocked
and the alarm's off. Get in.
- Okay.

185
00:14:16,004 --> 00:14:18,768
Play the volume loud as you want to,
but don't touch my levels now.

186
00:14:18,874 --> 00:14:21,308
- I got them set just like I like 'em.
- <i>Okay.</i>

187
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,916
[Three Beeps]

188
00:14:32,821 --> 00:14:35,119
Beaumont Livingston.

189
00:14:35,223 --> 00:14:37,282
Livingston, huh?
[Chuckling]

190
00:14:37,426 --> 00:14:41,863
<i>On his prior, he served nine months.</i>
<i>He's working on four years'probation.</i>

191
00:14:41,963 --> 00:14:45,160
- You don't say.
- <i>You know what he's on probation for?</i>

192
00:14:45,233 --> 00:14:49,863
- Ain't got a clue.
- Possession of unregistered
machine guns.

193
00:14:49,971 --> 00:14:54,203
<i>Damn. Now, they're gonna consider</i>
<i>that a violation ofhis probation?</i>

194
00:14:54,309 --> 00:14:57,745
They do consider this
a violation of his probation.

195
00:14:57,846 --> 00:15:00,474
- <i>Your boy's looking at ten years,</i>
- Mm.

196
00:15:00,582 --> 00:15:02,641
<i>Plus the concealed weapon.</i>

197
00:15:02,784 --> 00:15:08,086
He ain't gonna like that. Beaumont ain't
got a doing-time kind of disposition.

198
00:15:09,891 --> 00:15:12,917
- I need your name and address.
- Ordell Robbie.

Compton, 90222.

203
00:15:25,207 --> 00:15:29,007
- Is that a house or an apartment?
- That's a house.

00:15:33,215 --> 00:15:36,582
- [Buzzing]
- Who the fuck is this?

205
00:15:36,718 --> 00:15:39,778
It's your benefactor, nigger.
I'm comin' up.

206
00:15:39,921 --> 00:15:42,481
Come on up, nigger.
It's open.

207
00:15:42,624 --> 00:15:44,888
My pleasure of living...

208
00:15:44,993 --> 00:15:48,485
demands that I have
a good-looking woman,
that I'm with a good-looking woman.

209
00:15:48,597 --> 00:15:51,361
<i>I couldn't go out with a woman</i>
<i>old enough to be my wife.</i>

210
00:15:51,433 --> 00:15:54,459
- O.D.!
- Ah-ha-ha!

211
00:15:54,569 --> 00:15:57,538
- Look at you and your free ass.
- What's up, man?

212
00:15:57,639 --> 00:15:59,800
Come here, boy.
Give me a motherfuckin' hug.

213
00:15:59,908 --> 00:16:02,968
- I didn't know you were coming by.
- [Laughs] Yeah.

214
00:16:03,078 --> 00:16:04,978
My nigger.

215
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,776
Good lookin' out, man. I don't know
what to say. Thank you, thank you.

216
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:10,477
- Uh-huh. Who was there
for your ass, huh?
- You was there.

217
00:16:10,619 --> 00:16:12,519
- Who? Who? Who?
- You. You, nigger. You.

218
00:16:12,621 --> 00:16:15,419
You goddamn right. See?
That's how that shit works.

219
00:16:15,524 --> 00:16:17,958
You get your ass in trouble,
I get your ass out.

220
00:16:18,093 --> 00:16:23,429
That's my motherfucking job.
And I don't mind telling you,
nigger, it's steady work.

221
00:16:23,532 --> 00:16:26,990
Hey, look here, man, I'm still scared
as a motherfucker, O.D.

222
00:16:27,068 --> 00:16:28,968
They talkin' like they
serious as hell...

223
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:30,970
givin' me time for
that machine gun shit.

224
00:16:31,072 --> 00:16:33,506
Oh, come on, man. They're just
trying to put a fright in your ass.

225
00:16:33,608 --> 00:16:35,508
If that's what they're doin',
they done did it.

226
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:39,273
- How old is that machine gun shit, huh?
- About three years.

227
00:16:39,381 --> 00:16:41,941
Three years? Come on, man,
that's a old crime, man.

228
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:44,985
They ain't got room in the joint
for all these niggers out here
killing people now.

229
00:16:45,086 --> 00:16:46,986
How they gonna
find room for you?

230
00:16:47,088 --> 00:16:48,988
That ain't what
they're telling me.

231
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:53,117
That's why they call it
"fuckin' with you." Now, let me
tell you how we're going to retaliate.

232
00:16:53,228 --> 00:16:57,164
All right? Tomorrow I'm gonna pick
you up, take you over to Century City,

233
00:16:57,232 --> 00:16:59,132
introduce you
to my lawyer.

234
00:16:59,234 --> 00:17:03,728
Let me tell you
something about my lawyer.
This brother's name is Stacin Goins.

235
00:17:03,838 --> 00:17:05,738
This nigger
is a junkyard dog.

236
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,206
He my own personal
Johnny Cochran.

237
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,710
Matter of fact,
he kicked Johnny Cochran's ass.

238
00:17:10,812 --> 00:17:14,304
And likeJohnny Cochran,
this nigger hate cops. I'm serious, man.

239
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,976
He live to fuck
with the police.

240
00:17:17,118 --> 00:17:20,019
Now, as a favor,
I had him look at your case.

241
00:17:20,121 --> 00:17:23,579
He say you ain't got shit to
worry about. They just fuckin' with you.

242
00:17:23,725 --> 00:17:29,595
So we're gonna sic
the junkyard dog on their ass
and make 'em stop fuckin' with you.

243
00:17:29,698 --> 00:17:31,859
- Good lookin' out, man.
Good lookin' out.
- Hmm? Mm-hmm.

244
00:17:31,933 --> 00:17:34,663
- Come on in, man, and let's celebrate.
- No, no. Uh-uh.

245
00:17:34,769 --> 00:17:37,169
Look here, I'm really
supposed to be somewhere.

246
00:17:37,272 --> 00:17:41,208
Matter of fact, I was kind of hoping
you could come run with me.

247
00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:43,209
What you mean?

248
00:17:43,311 --> 00:17:45,211
You know, man,

249
00:17:45,313 --> 00:17:48,214
I hate to be the kind of nigger
that do a nigger a favor,

250
00:17:48,316 --> 00:17:50,614
then bam... hit the nigger up
for a favor in return,

251
00:17:50,752 --> 00:17:52,720
but I gots to be
that kind of nigger.

252
00:17:52,854 --> 00:17:56,153
- What? What you want?
- I need a favor, nigger.

253
00:17:56,257 --> 00:17:59,158
- That requires me to go out tonight?
- Just a bit.

254
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:02,058
Aw, man, I wasn't plannin'
on goin' no place tonight.

255
00:18:02,163 --> 00:18:05,758
It is late as hell, man.
I'm home, I'm high, man. Come on.

256
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:08,394
Uh-huh.
And why are you home, huh?

257
00:18:08,503 --> 00:18:12,803
You home because I spent $10,000
to get your ass home.

258
00:18:12,907 --> 00:18:16,809
Now, look, I got a little problem,
all right?

259
00:18:16,911 --> 00:18:19,311
I need some help,
and you can help me out.

260
00:18:19,414 --> 00:18:21,905
Go in the house and throw some shit on.
Let's walk out to the car.

261
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:23,917
Come on.

262
00:18:26,788 --> 00:18:29,188
I'm ready, man. What's your problem?
There ain't no problem.

263
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:31,190
It's more like
a situation.

264
00:18:31,292 --> 00:18:35,558
You remember them three
M-60 machine guns I sold
last year outta the five I got?

265
00:18:35,664 --> 00:18:38,497
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm gonna sell
the other two tonight.

266
00:18:38,566 --> 00:18:43,128
There's this group of Koreans
over in Koreatown startin' this
little Neighborhood Watch thing.

267
00:18:43,238 --> 00:18:47,436
They need some weapons so they
can show the neighborhood niggers
they mean business.

268
00:18:47,542 --> 00:18:51,501
Now, I'm gonna sell them the other
two machine guns, all right?

269
00:18:51,613 --> 00:18:54,912
The problem is, I ain't never done
business with these Koreans before.

270
00:18:55,016 --> 00:18:57,951
I ain't worried, 'cause by and large
Asians are very dependable.

271
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:59,953
They don't want no trouble.

272
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:02,114
You might argue with them
about price and shit,

273
00:19:02,257 --> 00:19:04,657
but you ain't gotta worry about
them shootin' you in the back.

274
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:06,659
But I got me a rule:

275
00:19:06,761 --> 00:19:10,663
Never do business with people
you ain't never done business
with before without backup.

276
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:13,292
That's why I need you.
Backup.

277
00:19:13,401 --> 00:19:18,395
Look, all you've got to do is lay in
here and hold on to this motherfucker.

278
00:19:18,506 --> 00:19:21,873
All right? I'm gonna tell 'em I'm goin'
in the trunk to show 'em the goods.

279
00:19:21,976 --> 00:19:24,877
When I open the trunk, you pop up
and rack this motherfucker.

280
00:19:24,979 --> 00:19:26,879
Man, fuck that shit.
I ain't for shootin' nobody.

281
00:19:26,981 --> 00:19:28,881
I ain't said nothin'
about you shootin' nobody.

282
00:19:28,983 --> 00:19:31,474
All you gotta do is hold on to it.
They'll get the idea.

283
00:19:31,619 --> 00:19:35,055
You must be out of your mind
if you think I'm gonna get
in this dirty-ass trunk.

284
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:37,351
We ain't goin' nowhere

00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:42,963
Fuckin' turbulence
was unbelievable.

431
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,768
Hey, can I look

Ah.

Goddamn.

434
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:04,258

<i>What would you say, Ray?</i>

437
00:29:09,463 --> 00:29:13,194
Looks like about 50,000
from here.

438
00:29:15,102 --> 00:29:18,503
- Is this your money?
- What if I say no?

439
00:29:18,606 --> 00:29:22,167
<i>You should know if you bring in anything</i>

441
00:29:24,945 --> 00:29:29,314
You can get a $250,000 fine,
plus two years in prison.

442
00:29:29,417 --> 00:29:33,114
You want to talk to us about this,
or do you want to talk to Customs?

443
00:29:33,254 --> 00:29:35,552
- I'm not sayin' another word.
- Jackie...

444

I hope you don't mind

445
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:42,359
Those guys down in Customs?
They're a bunch of pricks.
Excuse me, but they are.

446
00:29:42,463 --> 00:29:47,059
There's something about
that job makes those people
really hard to get along with.

447
00:29:47,134 --> 00:29:49,534
You can go down and talk
with those guys...

448
00:29:49,637 --> 00:29:52,936
who are really suspicious
and really disagreeable human beings,

449
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:57,943
or you can talk with a couple of
good-hearted guys like Mark and myself.

That pilot was my husband,

456

<i>You mean they offered you a deal,</i>

- May I smoke?
- <i>No, you may not.</i>

<i>[Dargas] Can she afford</i>

473
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:21,853
Yeah? No?

474
00:31:21,962 --> 00:31:24,362
- <i>[Pours Coffee]</i>
- Because he knows you.

Well, he knew you.

He doesn't know anybody now.
He's dead.

477
00:31:29,236 --> 00:31:32,296
They found him in a trunk
of a car this morning,

478
00:31:32,406 --> 00:31:34,533
shot twice.

479
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:38,339
Once in the chest,
once in the head.

480

Here you go.
So I guess I'm wondering.

481

If you don't know Beaumont,

00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,822

knows you?

483

move it over

Oh, hell, yeah.

You know, they see I pay

they start thinking that "where there's

00:37:13,947 --> 00:37:16,575
Rousted my ass out of bed
10:00 in the morning.

573
00:37:16,683 --> 00:37:18,844
Scared the shit out
of my woman Sheronda.

574
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:21,887
She thought they was gonna
take my ass away for sure.

575
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:25,481
- This stewardess...
You know her last name?
- Mm-hmm.

576
00:37:25,626 --> 00:37:29,323
Brown.
Jackie Brown.

577
00:37:29,429 --> 00:37:31,897
- What does she do for you?
- Who said she do anything for me?

578
00:37:31,965 --> 00:37:35,492
She's my friend. My friends get
in trouble, I like to help them out.

579
00:37:35,602 --> 00:37:37,593
Beaumont worked for you.

580
00:37:37,704 --> 00:37:41,140
This you and me talking,
like lawyer-client thing?

581
00:37:41,241 --> 00:37:43,141
You can't tell nothing
I say to you?

582
00:37:43,243 --> 00:37:46,679
You're not my client till you
get busted and I bond you out.

583
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:51,012
Well, we ain't got no, uh...
What you call that shit?

584
00:37:51,151 --> 00:37:53,051
Confidentiality.

585
00:37:53,153 --> 00:37:55,053
Why should I
tell you anything?

586
00:37:55,155 --> 00:37:57,521
'Cause you want me to know
what a slick guy you are.

587
00:37:57,624 --> 00:37:59,956
You got stewardesses
bringing you 50 grand.

588
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:03,291
And why would a stewardess
be bringing me 50 grand?

589
00:38:03,397 --> 00:38:06,798
Now you want me to speculate
on what you do.

590
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:11,395
I'd say you were in the drug business,
except the money's moving
in the wrong direction.

591
00:38:11,505 --> 00:38:16,374
Whatever you're into, you seem
to be getting away with it,
so, uh, more power to you.

592
00:38:16,476 --> 00:38:19,070
All right.
You want another bond?

593
00:38:19,179 --> 00:38:21,841
You want to move the 10,000 you got
on Beaumont over to the stewardess.

594
00:38:21,949 --> 00:38:23,849
That means paperwork.

595
00:38:23,951 --> 00:38:26,442
I gotta get a death certificate,
present it to the court,

596
00:38:26,587 --> 00:38:30,023
make out a receipt for
return of bond collateral,
I type up another application,

597
00:38:30,157 --> 00:38:32,148
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Another indemnity agreement.

598
00:38:32,292 --> 00:38:34,556
- I haven't got time.
- I'm telling you what I have to do.

599
00:38:34,661 --> 00:38:36,561
What you have to do,
in case you forgot,

600
00:38:36,663 --> 00:38:39,826
- is come up with a premium
of a thousand bucks.
- I can do that.

601
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,801
You know I got the money.
I just ain't got it with me.

602
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:45,394
Come back when you do.
I'll bond out the stewardess.

603
00:38:45,505 --> 00:38:49,464
Look, you got to look at this
with a little compassion, all right?

604
00:38:49,576 --> 00:38:52,704
Jackie ain't no criminal. She ain't
used to this kind of treatment.

605
00:38:52,813 --> 00:38:55,646
Gangsters don't give a fuck,
but your average citizen,

606
00:38:55,749 --> 00:38:58,684
a couple of nights in County
get to fuckin' with their mind.

607
00:38:58,785 --> 00:39:01,083
Ordell, this isn't a bar.
You don't have a tab.

608
00:39:01,188 --> 00:39:03,213
Listen to me, all right?

609
00:39:03,357 --> 00:39:07,760
You got a 44-year-old, gainfully
employed black woman falsely accused...

610
00:39:07,895 --> 00:39:11,524
Falsely accused? She didn't come
back from Mexico with cocaine on her?

611
00:39:11,598 --> 00:39:13,964
Falsely accused
of"intent."

612
00:39:14,067 --> 00:39:17,400
If she had that shit...
and mind you, I'm saying <i>if</i>...

613
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:20,029
that was her own personal shit
to get high with.

614
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:23,667
Is white guilt supposed to make me
forget I'm running a business?

615
00:39:26,613 --> 00:39:29,013
Oh, it's like that, huh?

616
00:39:33,921 --> 00:39:35,821
All right.

617
00:39:38,458 --> 00:39:40,551
I got your little
thousand bucks.

You know,

677
00:44:25,011 --> 00:44:28,674
the other day I figured out
that I must have written about...

678
00:44:28,782 --> 00:44:32,343
15,000 bonds since
I've been in the business.

679
00:44:32,485 --> 00:44:36,512
I figure about 80% of those
were drug-related, so...

680
00:44:36,656 --> 00:44:40,490
if you want, I could help you
figure out your options.

681
00:44:43,196 --> 00:44:45,687
So far, they told me
if I cooperate,

682
00:44:45,765 --> 00:44:49,326
then I'll get probation,
maybe.

683
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:52,928
Or if I stand mute,
I can get as much as five years.

684
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:55,166
Does that sound right?

685
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:59,211
I'd say that if they try you
and convict you, you won't get
more than a year and a day.

686
00:44:59,312 --> 00:45:01,405
That's state time,
prison.

687
00:45:01,514 --> 00:45:03,744
But they won't
want to do that.

688
00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:06,842
They'll offer you simple possession,
a couple of months of county time...

689
00:45:06,987 --> 00:45:09,922
and a year or two
of probation.

690

put the dope in your bag?

Yeah.

what this is about.

for my ass.

694
00:45:22,035 --> 00:45:23,935

695
00:45:24,037 --> 00:45:27,564
- They even knew the exact amount.
- What did they want to know?

696
00:45:27,674 --> 00:45:30,575
Who gave me the money
and who I was givin' it to.

697
00:45:30,677 --> 00:45:34,204
They found this guy in the trunk
of a car with his head blown off.

698
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:36,612
They said it was him
who told them about me.

699
00:45:36,716 --> 00:45:40,812
That would be...

about him?

offer to help and see what happens.

864
00:56:37,777 --> 00:56:41,679
What I meant was to have a lawyer
do the negotiating for you.

865
00:56:41,781 --> 00:56:44,944
No, I want to talk to them first.
I know more now about Ordell's money.

866
00:56:45,051 --> 00:56:49,147
Well, if it's the A.T.F. Guy
that wants you, that'll only
interest him up to a point.

867
00:56:49,288 --> 00:56:51,813
I know, but it's
a lot of money.

868
00:56:51,958 --> 00:56:55,860
It's a half a million dollars
all in Cabo, and more coming in.

869
00:56:55,962 --> 00:57:00,023
- How'd you find that out?
- Ordell told me last night.

870
00:57:00,099 --> 00:57:03,557
- He called?
- He came by.

871
00:57:03,669 --> 00:57:07,298
- What'd you do?
- We talked.

872
00:57:07,406 --> 00:57:09,636
Do you think
he still trusts you?

873
00:57:09,742 --> 00:57:13,178
He had his doubts at first,
but he's always trusted me.

874
00:57:13,279 --> 00:57:17,113
And he wants to believe more than
anything else that he still can.

875
00:57:19,719 --> 00:57:21,949
- Why?
- <i>Because he needs my ass.</i>

876
00:57:22,088 --> 00:57:26,286
Otherwise, that money's just gonna sit
over there in Cabo. You want some sugar?

877
00:57:26,392 --> 00:57:30,351
<i>No, thank you. There's gotta be</i>
<i>other ways of getting it out.</i>

878
00:57:30,429 --> 00:57:33,489
<i>Maybe, but I'm the only one</i>
<i>he's ever used.</i>

879
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:36,500
I mean, he can't use his other people.
They're crooks.

880
00:57:36,602 --> 00:57:39,435
I mean, he might try to...
bring the money in himself,

881
00:57:39,538 --> 00:57:42,006
but he ain't gonna wanna
stand in no customs lines.

882
00:57:42,108 --> 00:57:45,805
<i>So, either he recruits another Cabo</i>
<i>stewardess or he continues to trust me.</i>

883
00:57:45,911 --> 00:57:48,505
And I made him feel
like he still can.

884
00:57:48,614 --> 00:57:51,481
Are you gonna offer
to set him up?

885
00:57:51,617 --> 00:57:55,053
Yeah, if I get off.
Otherwise, fuck 'em.

886
00:57:55,187 --> 00:57:59,021
It's very possible that
Ordell's killed somebody.

887
00:57:59,125 --> 00:58:01,559
Do you realize that?

888
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:05,858
Well, I ain't going back to jail and I
ain't doing that probation thing again.
