1
00:00:48,035 --> 00:00:48,765
Oh God,

2
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,800
God grant me the serenity
to accept the things

3
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,865
I cannot change

4
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,400
why did you fight it so hard, Earl?

5
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,800
Courage to change the
things that I can...

6
00:00:57,955 --> 00:00:58,665
come one!

7
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,100
You have been a good boy
for a long time

8
00:01:01,635 --> 00:01:03,235
you know you wanna do this

9
00:01:03,275 --> 00:01:04,400
and the wisdom...

10
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,100
...wisdom to know the difference

11
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,750
Taking, as He did,
This sinful world

12
00:01:18,755 --> 00:01:20,865
as it is, Not as I would have it

13
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,865
Trusting that He will make all
things right, lf I surrender to His will,

14
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,900
that I may be reasonably
happy in this life

15
00:01:26,535 --> 00:01:29,300
And supremely happy with
Him forever and next.

16
00:01:29,635 --> 00:01:30,600
Amen

17
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,850
I could go on and on

18
00:01:32,855 --> 00:01:34,500
about what a great guy here he is

19
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,565
how he give us so freely his time
and his money

20
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,700
even how he, uh, believing
how he cuts his toenails

21
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,700
let's get him here and speak
for himself

22
00:01:48,735 --> 00:01:50,065
ladies and gentlemen

23
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,800
I'll give you a business man,
philanthropist, a very dear friend

24
00:01:55,035 --> 00:01:56,600
and the Portland Chambers Commerce

25
00:01:56,605 --> 00:01:57,600
Man of the Year

26
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,400
Mr. Earl Brooks

27
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,335
thank you all

28
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:08,310
very much

29
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:08,910
uhm...

30
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:14,700
first thing i'd like to say is that I, uh...

31
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:19,000
i don't even know how i cut my toenails

32
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,565
20... years ago

33
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,750
when I started the Brook's box factory

34
00:02:26,755 --> 00:02:28,300
i never dream that i will...

35
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,800
I never dream that one day
i'll be standing here

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,800
did you... did you just see
Sis Wallace's dress?

37
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,435
You can see her nipples

38
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:56,500
at that age!

39
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,300
Wow, she cannot keep those
things hidden

40
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,400
the only thing that would have made
this evening more perfect...

41
00:03:03,435 --> 00:03:05,000
if is Jane had been here

42
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,300
Emma, she called to
congratulate me, right?

43
00:03:09,335 --> 00:03:11,900
She has mid terms coming up

44
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,800
I think she's dropping out

45
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,700
let's see

46
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,000
nothing she does is wrong with you, is it?

47
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,265
Well...

48
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,000
she missed a good party

49
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,800
it's not like it's not set up

50
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,900
you already know I don't like
pesty and lambs

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,900
you know i don't pick the lock

52
00:03:42,935 --> 00:03:43,800
no

53
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,400
you are the fucking man of the year

54
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,100
you deserve a treat

55
00:03:49,335 --> 00:03:50,800
no, Marshall, I said no

56
00:03:51,135 --> 00:03:52,365
I heard you...

57
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,500
but you don't mean no

58
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,000
what's wrong?

59
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,200
Nothing

60
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,200
[laughing]

61
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,400
You are flowning

62
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,100
I'm thinking about what I didn't say
in the speech

63
00:04:10,101 --> 00:04:10,801
oh...

64
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,665
honey

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,100
you were so... moving

66
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,000
you made us all laugh

67
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,500
i don't think anybody fold left down

68
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,800
they have their dance class tonight

69
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,600
you can just drive by...

70
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,765
...and look at them

71
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,100
there's not harming,
and just having a look

72
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,305
no, means no, Marshall

73
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:40,000
please...

74
00:04:40,235 --> 00:04:41,600
put it, please

75
00:04:41,795 --> 00:04:43,590
[laughing]

76
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,800
I though the food tonight was very good
but I was not crazy about the dessert

77
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,700
would you like to stop somewhere
and get something sweet?

78
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:03,900
Ok

79
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,565
norad is an adorable small dog

80
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,100
the labrador is supposed
to be brave

81
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,400
Goltys, when he goes into the trailer
is very happy...

82
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,600
don't let me do this,
don't let me do this, please

83
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,500
I don't wanna start again

84
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,950
you promised to, you promised to

85
00:06:00,965 --> 00:06:02,965
please... please

86
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:06,100
why did you figth it so hard, Earl?

87
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,100
I'm going to stay up a while

88
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,200
maybe going to the studio or
play with some glaciers

89
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,000
ok

90
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,400
I'm gonna read... and If I'm not awake,
wake me when you come back

91
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,700
anyway?

92
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,100
I though you were wonderful tonight
Mrs Brooks

93
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,900
thank you Mr. Brooks

94
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,690
oh, I love the road my boy!
I have missed this...

95
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,100
we are going to have so much fun

96
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:16,500
this is the last time Marshall,
Understand me? It's the very last time!

97
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,400
Don't you dare, going on your
business, shut up

98
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,700
I wanna see what they are doing

99
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,800
hello

100
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,500
what the fuck!!!

101
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,050
Be quiet!

102
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:19,300
Set up!

103
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,800
Uh, Earl

104
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,600
what the fuck is this?

105
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,765
These fucking pigs like to do
with the curtains open

106
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,400
You should have know now this
is a big mistake for you, Earl

107
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,435
almost like a wanted get caught
on, Marshall

108
00:11:21,475 --> 00:11:23,900
I don't fucking do that

109
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:31,000
I don't think either what a joy is to spend
the rest of your life on death row
or a lethal injection

110
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,100
Yes, Sir

111
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,300
please, forgive me

112
00:12:34,335 --> 00:12:36,100
please, forgive me

113
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,300
please, forgive me

114
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,500
you are fucked hard,
Earl. I don't give you that

115
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,800
don't even think about it

116
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,600
you know the rules

117
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,300
now upstairs, make love with your
beautiful wife

118
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,000
can we have the room, please?

119
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,600
Thank you

120
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,100
there's just a thumbprint,
right there

121
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,500
one his, one hers?

122
00:13:54,535 --> 00:13:55,700
That was really nice

123
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,300
this guy has not been acting
for over 2 years

124
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,800
he always rearranges the bodies
but this is weird, I care of dare

125
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,500
usually he is much more romantic

126
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,800
arms around each other, kissing...

127
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,600
mouths open, tongues touching

128
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,935
bullets from straight of the victims

129
00:14:14,975 --> 00:14:16,400
killer would covered this a lot

130
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,635
these were open or closed
when you got here?

131
00:14:25,675 --> 00:14:26,700
Closed

132
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,100
could it be the work
of a copycat?

133
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,800
That's never been or viewed to the public
that the killer will treat his logs

134
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,700
Jesus, I was hoping this guy
was out or dead

135
00:14:41,735 --> 00:14:43,600
or in jail or in some other charge

136
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,800
we checked all neighbourhood,
but so far nobody saw a thing

137
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:58,000
maybe he don't like this... he must to be
really angry at them for some reason

138
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,900
where do they keep their vacuum cleaner?

139
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,600
So I bet you 100 bucks, Hawkins,
there is not bag in this vacuum cleaner

140
00:15:15,935 --> 00:15:17,565
I have not idea of what the hell you are look for

141
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,100
he vacuums the house...
and took the bag

142
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,700
what if he kills somebody that did
never get a vacuum cleaner?

143
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,500
He won't do that!!

144
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,300
Our best hope is if someone in
there saw something

145
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,100
detective Tracy Atwood?

146
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,900
- Yes
- this is for you

147
00:15:40,535 --> 00:15:41,600
you've been served

148
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,300
You, fucking asshole

149
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,165
- I am in the middle of a fucking
murdering investigation
- Listen lady

150
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,000
- i'm just a messanger, here
- Hawkins,

151
00:15:46,035 --> 00:15:46,800
what's the deal?

152
00:15:46,835 --> 00:15:47,117
I don't know it

153
00:15:47,152 --> 00:15:47,900
get his ass out of here!!

154
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,200
What it is?

155
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,400
Assume to be, my ex husband
scumbag lawyer's trying to show me,

156
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,300
just how painful she can make my life
if i don't give them what they want

157
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,100
other any new members?

158
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,000
Hello my name Voine

159
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:13,200
I am alcoholic, and I haven't had a drink
in 10 months

160
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,900
hi, my name is Earl, and...

161
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,500
I am an addict

162
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,400
anyone else?

163
00:16:32,435 --> 00:16:33,000
You are...

164
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,665
such a fuck hypocrite

165
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:39,500
if you run and you step up there and say
Hi, I'm Ear and I've killed two people last night

166
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,800
I really got off on it but I need your help,
to be cured

167
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,300
I'm different Marshall, i won't argue
that with you

168
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,400
this it is the only place that as ever
helped me be normal, and i've been straight up

169
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,400
untill last night...
for the past 2 years

170
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,200
I not going to kill again

171
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:04,000
and I am not going to quit coming here
because it upsets you

172
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,900
we need a clean up crew for afterwords, so...

173
00:17:08,035 --> 00:17:10,165
we need some volunteers
for the...

174
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,800
oh, thank you Earl, I appreciate that

175
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:27,000
there's time for requirements,
this is our first to tempt

176
00:17:27,035 --> 00:17:30,100
"Mr. Brooks, your daughter
is waiting for you in your office"

177
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,050
Well I hope this is what you have in mind,
if not...

178
00:17:36,085 --> 00:17:38,892
we would love to work with you,
further on the design

179
00:17:39,227 --> 00:17:41,700
always find the challenge on machines

180
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:46,400
now if you uh, gentlemen, will you excuse me
i need to see how much this is going to cost me

181
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,500
Understand

182
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:52,000

183
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,200
I believe you do understand

184
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,000
Uh, Matt Johnson, wants to schedule,
lunch for friday, contact him...

185
00:18:00,035 --> 00:18:01,600
- Sunday, did...
- Can you hold this for a second?

186
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,965
Did Jane call to say she was coming?

187
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,800
Uh, nobody gave me that
message Mr. Brooks

188
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,000
- she is...
- yeah, she is, and...

189
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,400
she has some boxes and suitcases downstairs
and she didn't have any money for the cab

190
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,200
and you paid for that

191
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,100
thank you

192
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:21,900

193
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,300
ah, hold my calls

194
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,265

195
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,500
I told you

196
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,900
when it's appropriate

197
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,700
you let me know

198
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,900
Ehy, can I've some water?

199
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,500
Hello gorgeous

200
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,200
what are you doing here?

201
00:18:40,235 --> 00:18:41,400
I'm sorry daddy

202
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,100
please, don't be angry with me

203
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,665
I can guess what you've done

204
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,700
but why don't you tell me then I'll decide

205
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,600
I've dropped out the school

206
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,300
oh Jane

207
00:18:57,335 --> 00:18:58,100
ok

208
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,200
uh... have you told your mother?

209
00:19:00,235 --> 00:19:01,865
No, I wanted to talk to you first

210
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,000
Well, you gonna have to tell her, Jane
All right?

211
00:19:04,035 --> 00:19:05,500
I'm not gonna do that for you

212
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,100
why can't you...

213
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,100
sit!

214
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,200
And then,

215
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,600
together, the three of us, we decide

216
00:19:11,835 --> 00:19:13,365
where it goes from here

217
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:17,100
Well, I thought a lot all about this?
College is a waste of time for me

218
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,900
All this...

219
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,365
All this... how somebody know that,
half way through their freshmen year?

220
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,400
You didn't even go to college daddy
and you are successful

221
00:19:26,435 --> 00:19:27,800
I wanna come work for you

222
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,800
she is not telling you everything,
she is hiding something

223
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,400
hell no!

224
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,465
I am not hiring right now, sweetheart

225
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,600
ok, but just listen to me
for one second

226
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,265
all right?

227
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:49,900
Look! What happen to the business if,
God forbid, something wouldn't happen to you?

228
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,865
Ok

229
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,700
mom would probably have to
sell the strangers

230
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,100
look, I willing to start from the bottom

231
00:19:57,135 --> 00:19:59,665
you can treat me like a regular employee

232
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,800
I just wanna learn everything there is to know
about running the box business

233
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:06,100
then, when the time comes...

234
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,900
i can stay in the family

235
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,065
all that's sweet, honey, but

236
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,900
you are not talking about business,
you are talking about emotions, now get up...

237
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:22,900
infact, Your mother and I, came...
this close to selling out last year

238
00:20:22,935 --> 00:20:23,265
what?

239
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,250
That's right, and hadn't will been offered
a little more money

240
00:20:25,251 --> 00:20:27,900
and still, may come back to us...

241
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,065
we would sell

242
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,700
what would you do without business?

243
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,600
Yes?

244
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:40,500
I'm sorry. The man outside insisted
that I'll give this to you, he claims

245
00:20:40,535 --> 00:20:43,200
that you'll find what's inside,
very interesting

246
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,900
what is he, Sunday?
Is he a salesman?

247
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,765
No, I've never seen him before

248
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,200
I'll just give him back and
I'll tell him to call

249
00:20:49,235 --> 00:20:50,900
No, Sunday, Sunday, here...

250
00:20:52,435 --> 00:20:53,100
Thank you

251
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,300
Jane

252
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,200
********* for you a psychologist

253
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,500
to give yourself a chance to...

254
00:21:03,535 --> 00:21:04,700
uh, find out...

255
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,700
who you are

256
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,200
and what you wanna do

257
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,665
I'll talk to mom

258
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,600
but I not going back to school

259
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,100
and where would you live?

260
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,265
Saved money, i'll look back home

261
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:30,300
but new rules,
I wanna be treated as adult

262
00:21:30,335 --> 00:21:31,800
would you pay for rent?

263
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,400
Would you pay for food?

264
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:41,800
No dad, you are a very welfy man
I think you can effort to keep me

265
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,200
Sunday, would you escort the gentleman
who gave you the envelope...

266
00:21:46,535 --> 00:21:49,317
into the conference room and tell him
i would meet him there?

267
00:21:49,412 --> 00:21:50,500
No problem, Mr Brooks

268
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:51,400
and, uh...

269
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,700
what happen to the BMW, Jane?

270
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,100
A friend is gonna drive it up
but he will be here week-end

271
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,800
and get Jane a cab

272
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,500
call your mother

273
00:22:09,535 --> 00:22:10,900
are you gonna gimme a job?

274
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:15,600
If you were up to me and I think
your mother will agree with this, I, uh...

275
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,800
I think you should go back to school

276
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,100
you see that Marshall?

277
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,900
That's why I didn't wanna
do that damned couple

278
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
stop with fucking widing your own

279
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:32,250
you enjoyed doing that couple
just as as much I did
and look at the right side

280
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,100
he cames to us,
he didn't go to the cops

281
00:22:35,135 --> 00:22:37,867
if he's trying to shake us down,
we kill him, period.

282
00:22:37,902 --> 00:22:40,300
We make it fun but we'll kill him

283
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,300
end of the story

284
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,400
what can I do for you, Mister...

285
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,400
Let's say... Smith

286
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,900
Ok Mr. Smith

287
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,300
before you get the wrong impression,
Mr Brooks, I'm not here to shake you down

288
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:13,600
I hope this is the only copies of
these photos and you have no others

289
00:23:14,035 --> 00:23:14,765
no

290
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,800
I have other copies and other photos

291
00:23:16,835 --> 00:23:17,900
and if anything happens to me...

292
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,400
how did you find me Mr. Smith?

293
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,000
You are the man of the year, Mr. Brooks

294
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,000
your picture is in the paper

295
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:33,800
and if it had not been... I don't know,
I don't know what I would have done

296
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,000
lucky me

297
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,700
what is it that I can help you with?

298
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,400
I've been watching that couple
for months

299
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
yeah, they liked to make love
with the blinds opened

300
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,700
sometimes I would... take pictures

301
00:23:50,235 --> 00:23:51,700
visual aids, for later

302
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,600
is a great way to get off, I tell you that

303
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:58,500
was fun, I though

304
00:23:58,935 --> 00:24:00,100
until I saw you killed them

305
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,665
and I have never

306
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:06,000
ever felt out that... rush!!

307
00:24:06,235 --> 00:24:07,200
Like that, ever

308
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,500
I know you are the thumbprint killer

309
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,200
you have done this before

310
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,400
what I want?

311
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:25,600
It's for you, to take me with you
next time you kills someone

312
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,900
and I'd like that to be soon

313
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,000
[laughing]

314
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,900
And you were worried this
was going to be unpleasant?

315
00:24:40,235 --> 00:24:41,465
The answer is simple

316
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,600
Just tell Mr. Smith that you have decided
never to kill again

317
00:24:45,735 --> 00:24:47,200
and you're going away

318
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,600
you enjoy watching me suffer, don't you?

319
00:24:50,135 --> 00:24:51,400
In a word, yes

320
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,100
where do you think he has
the other pictures?

321
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,400
He put it in a safety deposit box

322
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,700
but I bet the box is in the banks
where he keeps his checking account

323
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,300
and the key...

324
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,200
it's on his key chain

325
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,100
he really wants us to do this

326
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,100
he is not going to the cops

327
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,900
we have a deal?

328
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,100
For the angle of these pictures...

329
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:35,700
you live at the 3rd floor at apartment building
across the alley, front of the couple house

330
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,200
uh

331
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,100
yes or no, Mr. Smith?

332
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:41,900
Yes

333
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,900
what time did you get home from work?

334
00:25:44,935 --> 00:25:45,765
6.30

335
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,200
7, depending of the traffic

336
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,665
you can't never come here again

337
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,100
you can't never call me
do you understand that?

338
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,600
Yes

339
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,100
tomorrow night

340
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,065
not tonight, tomorrow night at 8 o'clock

341
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,400
leave your apartment building and walk east

342
00:26:06,735 --> 00:26:08,300
I will pick you up there

343
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,400
if you are thinking about doing anything...

344
00:26:15,435 --> 00:26:17,700
for both to aware the rules, Mr. Smith

345
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,600
but I feel I must warn you

346
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:26,000
if it turns out that you enjoy killing

347
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,000
you can become very addicted

348
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,600
it can ruins your life

349
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,700
I wanna do this

350
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,565
have I covered everything?

351
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,900
I can't think of anything else

352
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,300
then I'll see you tomorrow night Mr. Smith

353
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:04,700
we've talked to our client and
in common we put here what we figure out,
we feel this is more than fair

354
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,250
we can have a check for that
amount in your office by 6pm o'clock

355
00:27:10,485 --> 00:27:12,400
oh, we told you at the beginning
what we wanted

356
00:27:12,635 --> 00:27:13,800
and it hasn't changed

357
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,100
we feel our offer is more than generous

358
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,865
I paid for everything, when we were together

359
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:23,800
and now I'm been asked to give
this guy a bonus?

360
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:28,600
For spending time with me, time
that I've already paid for in the first place?

361
00:27:28,835 --> 00:27:32,400
You know as well as I do, counselor,
you're not gonna get a million five

362
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,900
Oh, I - don't - know that, no, I...

363
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,200
well, infact, this is the front page
of yesterday's paper

364
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,465
"Hangman escapes"

365
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,665
after torturing his victims

366
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,600
Thorton Meeks

367
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,165
well, hide him in public places,

368
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,400
church steeple, balconies,
freeways over passes...

369
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,400
where this is going?

370
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,000
Well, your client captures Mr. Meeks

371
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,800
Come on Tracy, this is not a lot of money
for you

372
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:04,300
and we both know how afraid that I was
after Meeks says that he was gonna
escape and come back to kill you

373
00:28:04,335 --> 00:28:05,600
let me ask again

374
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,565
what is your point?

375
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,500
Our point is that Meeks,
or someone like Meeks

376
00:28:11,535 --> 00:28:14,965
make hurt after my client in order
to hurt your client

377
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,765
that is very imaginative, counsellor

378
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,750
but it's not based in reality at all

379
00:28:20,885 --> 00:28:21,642
Jesse

380
00:28:21,677 --> 00:28:23,500
let's just handle this, please

381
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:24,665
- Tracy
- Jesse

382
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:28,000
you know what will make me
feel really safe right now?

383
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,400
If you got hit by a truck...

384
00:28:33,635 --> 00:28:34,600
and die

385
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,100
well, that's it?

386
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,965
Mr. Vialo and I, are leaving

387
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:44,900
you are threatening the safety of my client,
we are going after to get a straight order

388
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,400
we see in court

389
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,600
you hit by a truck and die?

390
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,400
Fuck it, I felt good

391
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,600
what was here it's not here,
that's interesting

392
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,765
I hate the number,
I'll say that this people been
killed by a ghost

393
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:05,600
the autopsy said there was a little tiny
piece of plastic in the female victim's brain

394
00:29:05,635 --> 00:29:10,167
it's a dead end, the bag with the gun,
he puts one gallon plastic foresinc bag
over his hand to his wrist

395
00:29:10,202 --> 00:29:14,700
little bit of plastic comes out,
when the first one is gonna shots,
it goes in the bag

396
00:29:14,735 --> 00:29:15,965
are you looking for me?

397
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,065
I've received the subpena from your husband
for your works records

398
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:22,500
where you worked, date and time,
for the past two years

399
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:27,300
he just tries to blackmail me, do you remember?
My lawyers assure me that I'll never go to court

400
00:29:27,335 --> 00:29:28,800
I can't take that chance

401
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,665
almost three courts of your cases is a current

402
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:35,400
so, until you'll set your divorce
i'm gonna have to put you on the desk

403
00:29:35,935 --> 00:29:37,500
that's also blackmail

404
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,665
do you have any idea what this
guy has done to me?

405
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,600
While we're married,
while i was paying for everything

406
00:29:44,035 --> 00:29:46,567
he was just out and fuck every woman
he can gets his hands on

407
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:49,300
he fucked my friends, he fucked my cousin

408
00:29:49,335 --> 00:29:50,500
he made me look as an idiot

409
00:29:50,535 --> 00:29:51,800
- and?
- And what?

410
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,700
Get over it!

411
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,900
You can't roll there's a woman wanna
have this one blousy man in your life

412
00:29:58,935 --> 00:30:02,017
well, I made him an offer
and I won't goin to give him a dime more

413
00:30:02,352 --> 00:30:03,600
did you hear that Meeks escaped?

414
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,665
Yeah

415
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,900
you get gonna looking for him,
you want me yo put a detail on you?

416
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,100
I think I can take care of myself

417
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:15,000
it's one of your biggest problem, Tracy
you don't know how to ask for help

418
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,200
what the fuck, what the fuck, what...

419
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:10,400
don't worry, if I were here to kill you,
you were already be dead

420
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,300
[panting]

421
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:17,565
After you left today, I realize that our friendship
was a little one side of it

422
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,800
so, tomorrow night when we meet,
would you be so kind us to bring

423
00:31:22,101 --> 00:31:25,001
all the pictures and the memory
card from your camera

424
00:31:26,335 --> 00:31:29,400
that way we can like each other
simply for who we are

425
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,600
if you don't show up

426
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:37,100
I will presume that you have gone
to the police and I will kill you

427
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,600
even if I'll go to jail because of you Mr Smith,
someone will find you, wherever you are...

428
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,600
and they will kill you

429
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,200
Mr. Brooks

430
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:00,800
Mr. Brooks

431
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,300
Mr. Brooks

432
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
WoW

433
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:34,080
WoW

434
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,200
it's nice to have you home

435
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,800
hello, hello. You have to explain this to me
'cause i'm your mother, that's why!

436
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,700
What's wrong, girls?

437
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,400
I asked your daughter what's the real reason
she dropped out the school

438
00:33:57,835 --> 00:33:59,700
I told you, it's not the real reason

439
00:34:00,135 --> 00:34:00,965
honey...

440
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,300
you wanted to go to college

441
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,000
you have good grades, your father
put in favours to get you in that school

442
00:34:05,035 --> 00:34:06,265
if this is not the reason...

443
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,965
please, Dear God, tell me the reason

444
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,700
what is your mother thinking
even dropped you out the school?

445
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,000
I'm pregnant

446
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,365
but that's not the reason I dropped out

447
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,900
being pregnant wouldn't keep me
for going to school if I wanted to

448
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,900
who is the father?

449
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,700
Some guy a was seeing

450
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,000
some, some guy, does he knows?

451
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,365
What he knows Dad?

452
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,200
He is married, he got two kids,
I want nothing to do with me

453
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,065
oh, honey

454
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,065
oh, honey

455
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,565
I'm not gonna go throw with it

456
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,700
there is nothing to be upset about

457
00:34:42,735 --> 00:34:44,300
I mean, I was even not
gonna tell you guys

458
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:44,900
then would be

459
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,800
no abortion, jane

460
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,965
no Dad, you're not gonna tell
me what to do, ok?

461
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,900
It's my body and I'll do what I want with it

462
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,700
I'm sorry, you're right. I said it wrong

463
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,000
I wasn't trying to tell you
what to do when I was...

464
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,000
what I was trying to say is that...

465
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,500
a grandchild would be a wonderful gift

466
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,100
for your mother and me

467
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:19,700
would you really wanna
have a grandchild?
Even if I'm not married?

468
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,200
Yes

469
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,800
a child is what's important

470
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:30,400
we would... we would love him
and cheer him completely and we would...

471
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,400
we would help you raise him

472
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,600
if it means that much to you,
I will think about it

473
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,600
I'm gonna have to start getting up
little earlier, uh, honey?

474
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,400
Well, we were right

475
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,865
she was hiding something

476
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:04,000
pregnancy is not of all of it,
she's hiding something bigger

477
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,200
something much bigger

478
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:11,700
you think so?

479
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,300
I know so

480
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,300
and so do you

481
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,900
it's darker tonight than it was
on your night

482
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,200
but still...

483
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,900
how did you managed to not bumping
into the furniture?

484
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,365
Was the light on?

485
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,000
Or did you turn it on?

486
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:44,000
Because I know you and you
won't risk a shot in the dark

487
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,465
where have you been?

488
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,700
Did you miss the thrill of killing?

489
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,600
What if these are stayed closed

490
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,400
because you yanked them closed

491
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,800
which would mean...

492
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,365
they were open...

493
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,400
...when you came into the room

494
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,400
thank you, I appreciate your time

495
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,100
ops, sorry, i'm sorry

496
00:38:36,135 --> 00:38:37,200
no, I'm sorry

497
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,165
I was just about to knock

498
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,200
I'm detective Atwood,
portland police

499
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:42,500
hey, do you wanna see me?

500
00:38:42,535 --> 00:38:43,500
Fine

501
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,300
you are a photographer Mr...
...Bafford?

502
00:38:47,335 --> 00:38:48,600
- No
- No?

503
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,100
Thank you

504
00:38:50,135 --> 00:38:50,765
no,

505
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,900
uh, actually it's... a hobby i just started

506
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,200
well, do you know, there was a murder?

507
00:38:57,235 --> 00:38:59,165
Yes, in the house, close the way

508
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:03,200
You didn't happen to see something unusual or
suspicious that night, did you?

509
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,100
No, I wondered that when it happened, but

510
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,200
no

511
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,500
I'm sorry, i'm supposed to be meeting somebody

512
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:13,700
and I don't want to be late

513
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,065
uh, well, here is my card

514
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,900
if you did hear something or
remember anything

515
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:24,700
uh, i wish I could be more helped,
but, uh, sorry!!

516
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,600
He looks clean

517
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,900
looks like he's alone

518
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:48,000
no, i tell you, he really
wants to do that

519
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,800
maybe I should plow with
him... pick him up

520
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,100
no, just honk

521
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:59,600
maybe he get killed crossing the street
and save us the mess he's doing up

522
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:08,000
[laughing]

523
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,800
Almost

524
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,300
it's coming down hard

525
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,100
they said would be sunny tomorrow

526
00:40:36,135 --> 00:40:36,965
I never trust those guys

527
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,600
they say it's gonna be clear, then rains

528
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,700
and they say it's gonna rains
and it's... sunny

529
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,300
I believe this is what you asked for

530
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,600
the pictures in the memory card...

531
00:40:50,635 --> 00:40:51,400
all here

532
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,500
both

533
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:59,700
you and I both know that not all
the pictures are in here

534
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:03,200
and you made a copy of the
memory card, as an asshole

535
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,800
but, you understand my position?

536
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,200
Yes, I do

537
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:15,400
but it's my hope you want to get to know me better
you feel confortable in giving me everything

538
00:41:15,435 --> 00:41:17,200
that I've asked you for

539
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,400
sounds fair

540
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,100
maybe you'll be interested in this

541
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,300
this is the police woman,
who is looking for you

542
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,800
wow, we never know anyone
was looking for us before

543
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,600
you have to find everything there
is to know about this...

544
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:37,900
woman

545
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,600
this is close, Marshall

546
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,400
this is to damn close

547
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,500
so...

548
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,000
what's the plan?

549
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:54,200
Where do we, uh, what are we
doing here tonight?

550
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,200
We'll drive around until we see
someone we think we might

551
00:41:58,835 --> 00:41:59,800
enjoy killing

552
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:03,600
really?

553
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,100
You don't have have somebody...

554
00:42:06,135 --> 00:42:06,565
in mind

555
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,900
I don't enjoy this Mr. Smith, I do it

556
00:42:09,135 --> 00:42:10,700
because I am addicted to it

557
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:15,000
before you're in in my life I had that
I would never kill again

558
00:42:15,035 --> 00:42:18,200
so, this is... your part

559
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:22,900
you can choose anyone you want
and we will do it together

560
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,500
can i pick somebody that I know?

561
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
[Laughing]

562
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:37,900
No

563
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,000
you'll never kill someone you know

564
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:44,300
it's the easiest way to get caught

565
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,200
- ok?
- Yeah

566
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,600
locked up?

567
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,100
You look a little bit like that...

568
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:57,765
E.T. Guy

569
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,000
remember that movie?
When he flies on that bike?

570
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:01,000
- Yeah, yeah
- yeah

571
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,350
I like that movie

572
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:03,200
Jesus Christ

573
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:08,865
fuck him

574
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,900
this is fault, he is an asshole

575
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:12,800
fuck you

576
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:17,700
maybe Mr Smith would like to kill

577
00:44:17,735 --> 00:44:19,300
the driver of the pick up

578
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,100
what about the driver of the pick up?

579
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:30,000
What if we kill him?

580
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:33,000
Yes

581
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:36,800
yes, I always wanted to fucking kill somebody
fucking to be in traffic

582
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:41,000
well, if you want to kill the driver of pick up

583
00:44:41,035 --> 00:44:41,800
I'll give you the honor

584
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:46,400
ehy, maybe not be the same

585
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:50,300
driver

586
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:52,800
ok

587
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:56,100
well, driver I am, to will give a good
looking at him or her

588
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,400
any problem to kill a woman?

589
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,100
No, no. An asshole is an asshole

590
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:10,900
[laughing]

591
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,650
I wasn't in town that night

592
00:45:12,685 --> 00:45:14,035
my roommate was, maybe he
saw something

593
00:45:14,075 --> 00:45:15,200
Uh, may I speak to him?

594
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:18,700
He is in on his way to Tokyo right now,
he is also a flight attendant

595
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,000
did the victims ever leave their
bedroom curtains open?

596
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:24,100
All the time

597
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:28,900
I don't know if we can see them doing it
and that's why you are asking but they didn't care

598
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:31,100
well, here is my card

599
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,150
if you can have your roommate call me

600
00:45:32,185 --> 00:45:35,100
and people of this number
know how to reach me at everytime,
day and night

601
00:45:35,135 --> 00:45:37,000
I won't be here, but
I will leave him a note

602
00:45:37,035 --> 00:45:38,000
ok great, thank you

603
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:38,900
sure

604
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:34,800
would recognize him if you saw his
driving licence picture?

605
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:36,100
Yeah

606
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:41,600
I'll memorize the licence number,
you write it down

607
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:43,500
I got it

608
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:46,500
wow

609
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,600
well, when you get home,
go on the Internet

610
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,700
find everything you can...
about this guy

611
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:55,900
we are gonna kill him tonight?

612
00:46:55,935 --> 00:46:56,900
No

613
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:00,865
we could, but then we won't be
under control

614
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:06,000
we can leave lose ends but
we both know the danger of that

615
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:08,000
ok, I will do

616
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,000
what are... we... doing?

617
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,300
What are you doing?

618
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,000
Look at me!

619
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,000
- Look at me!
- Why?

620
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,600
- Close your eyes
- why?

621
00:47:28,635 --> 00:47:29,600
Close

622
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,500
what's the licence plate number?

623
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:38,800
Shit

624
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:40,150
P4...

625
00:47:40,185 --> 00:47:41,292
no

626
00:47:41,327 --> 00:47:42,400
2, uh

627
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:44,300
I know I tore, then

628
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
because of the tree?

629
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:48,965
Don't feel bad

630
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,800
I've been doing this a long time.
Pen and paper

631
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,100
look out the window and write it down

632
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,300
how is your first time like?

633
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:02,000
You really don't wanna know
that much about me, Mr. Smith

634
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:20,500
no, I don't think it was right, go back

635
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,600
ok, we are in

636
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:28,300
for all the taxes we pay you think
they'll make it more difficult

637
00:48:28,335 --> 00:48:30,500
to hack into the police personnel file

638
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:35,300
the father is John Atwood, why...

639
00:48:35,335 --> 00:48:37,300
why does that ring a bell?

640
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:39,500
Somebody you got business with?

641
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:41,450
Someone we...

642
00:48:41,685 --> 00:48:42,800
killed

643
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:44,400
no, no somebody we killed

644
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:46,800
let me see here, MBA

645
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:50,250
and married, she has been a cop for 12 years

646
00:48:50,285 --> 00:48:52,500
married Dr. Carlson

647
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:56,300
divorced Dr. Carlson married at
Jesse Vialo

648
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,700
and so two are separated, from
Jesse Vialo sue

649
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,200
...for support by Jesse Vialo seems

650
00:49:03,235 --> 00:49:04,800
uhm, seem a shrimp

651
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,600
because of Jesse Vialo

652
00:49:06,635 --> 00:49:08,400
who, who, who

653
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,565
she has caught a lot of people

654
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:16,500
and look here, this is not her first time
she has been looking for us

655
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:20,000
ok, here we are

656
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:25,700
Jesse Vialo, good looking, a little
younger than she is

657
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:28,700
younger, rest of all to her

658
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:32,065
she married him in a rebound
from the doctor

659
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:35,400
and the boy has married her for money
and connections

660
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,100
just because the old men that
doesn't mean she is rich

661
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:43,400
maybe is one of the kind of guys
ready to give her to the oprah

662
00:49:43,435 --> 00:49:44,600
and than to his kids

663
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:50,700
what does she have to declare?
Any outside and coming holdings?

664
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:01,765
Oh, you are a...

665
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,400
you are a genius

666
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:07,700
the oprah didn't get much

667
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,150
why would a woman,
worth 60 plus million dollars...

668
00:50:15,785 --> 00:50:17,300
and probably more to come...

669
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:20,600
wanna be a cop?

670
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,300
I like that about her

671
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:29,150
you are a such a fucking snob, Earl
you like her because she is rich

672
00:50:29,385 --> 00:50:31,500
no, i like her because she founds
something that's hers,

673
00:50:31,501 --> 00:50:34,001
is not the family business,
and she is good at it

674
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,900
I'd like Jane to find something it's... hers

675
00:50:38,601 --> 00:50:40,101
and than she can be good at it

676
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,450
That's exactly why I would scare
the shit out of me

677
00:50:47,485 --> 00:50:49,492
she's a cop who doesn't need the money...

678
00:50:50,707 --> 00:50:52,700
and she is looking for us.

679
00:50:52,701 --> 00:50:54,701
That's one fucking dangerous human being

680
00:50:57,100 --> 00:51:00,000
the fact you are not wrong
just not making me me admire her

681
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:01,500
any less

682
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
hey Nancy!!

683
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:03,900
Hi Tracy,

684
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:05,500
thank you for meeting me here

685
00:51:05,535 --> 00:51:06,300
I got your latte

686
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,900
you wanna be walk and talk
while I hear your big idea?

687
00:51:08,935 --> 00:51:09,800
Oh, sure

688
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,100
you really wanna settle this?

689
00:51:11,135 --> 00:51:11,900
If I can

690
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,200
I'd like to use your father

691
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:16,600
no

692
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,565
my father does nothing for nothing

693
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:22,300
Tracy, I understand but your father
has a lot of political massed

694
00:51:22,335 --> 00:51:23,865
his poll won't make everything go away

695
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:25,200
but it would be a tremendous help

696
00:51:25,235 --> 00:51:26,200
absolutely not

697
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:27,565
you're right

698
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,065
we could have done this one on the phone

699
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,700
if you will wanna play the game
right on the desk for a year

700
00:51:31,715 --> 00:51:33,765
- i'm sure we can settle it at 1,25 - 1,5...
- uff, I...

701
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,100
I'm not sit on a desk

702
00:51:35,135 --> 00:51:36,900
an the only other option is your father

703
00:51:37,035 --> 00:51:37,800
or money

704
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,300
1,5 and that's it

705
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:43,700
ok

706
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,200
I'll call them today

707
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:49,100
I just need to get this done as
soon as possible

708
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,000
that's what Jesse is counting on

709
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:54,800
I'll call you when I have something

710
00:51:57,700 --> 00:51:58,600
oh, Tracy

711
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:03,400
your husband said there's a picture of him
holding some trophy, that you still have?

712
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,300
What picture? He has everything

713
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:08,600
he claims it's his favourite picture

714
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:10,700
and you put it up when you store
your suitcases

715
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:12,500
I'll look

716
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:13,900
I Know?

717
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,100
Petty, you are going to divorce

718
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,200
thanks for the latte

719
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:45,400
I told you I was coming back to get you

720
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,500
how do you find the place where
i'm gonna hang you?

721
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,100
First

722
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:54,185
I'm gonna watch her

723
00:52:54,225 --> 00:52:55,500
have some fun with you

724
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:01,300
then she is gonna watch me,
have some fun with you

725
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:03,800
you know...

726
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:17,400
don't fucking move!!

727
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:18,500
Shoot me!

728
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:21,500
Come on, shoot me, motherfucker

729
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,450
5 down

730
00:54:02,185 --> 00:54:06,700
"sleeper's dimmer"...
..."sleeper's dimmer"

731
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:08,000
incubus

732
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,400
maybe he go home with someone else

733
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,800
can you still see his pick up?

734
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,500
Uh, uh

735
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,665
this is not the kind of guy

736
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:24,000
who use his pick up in an
unguarded lot over night

737
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:26,565
how do you know that?

738
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:29,500
Somebody didn't do their
homework last night

739
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:38,600
"time saw years willing"

740
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:46,600
let me get it, the engine gear

741
00:54:46,635 --> 00:54:47,600
yeah!

742
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:58,900
Where do we know that guy from?

743
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
You really sure I pay more attention
that what you really, Earl?

744
00:55:08,035 --> 00:55:10,000
That's what I have you for, Marshall

745
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:14,300
His picture was on the frontpage
of the papers a couple of days ago

746
00:55:14,335 --> 00:55:17,600
because he escapes from jail
he is the killer they call "The Hangman"

747
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:21,500
you remember that cop?

748
00:55:21,535 --> 00:55:22,700
Who you like?

749
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:24,500
Atwood?

750
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:31,200
Who is chasing us?
She is the one put him away

751
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:34,550
wow, wow

752
00:55:34,785 --> 00:55:36,300
what would life be...

753
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,400
without surprises!

754
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:40,000
There it is!

755
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:41,000
There it is!

756
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:44,100
Ah, ah

757
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:45,965
i'm in hot wild

758
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:49,800
this guy has been get also his plans
for tonight and tomorrow night

759
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:53,300
he has not idea, he'll already be dead

760
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,300
he will not be able to do anything

761
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:04,600
I don't think I wanna kill this guy

762
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:07,200
what?

763
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:08,800
Oh, ahi...

764
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:11,800
what - you - are - thinking?

765
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:16,400
You have no idea of what I'm thinking

766
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:17,665
yes I do

767
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,400
and it's wondefully twisted

768
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,400
wait a minute, are you...
uh... you promised?

769
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:25,200
I know I said we would

770
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:28,700
but I don't think would be that much fun

771
00:56:28,735 --> 00:56:30,300
so, that is?
Just no

772
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:32,500
Yes

773
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:35,400
- uh, oh
- so...

774
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:38,900
you got the licence plate?

775
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:39,500
Yeah

776
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:45,100
they found the Van in an underground parking
lot about two miles from where they left you

777
00:56:45,135 --> 00:56:46,400
they stolen it last night

778
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,550
we are checking security camera tapes

779
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:50,465
if Meeks and the woman are left in a car

780
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:51,800
we'll have her licence plate number

781
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,290
these other women we have pictures
over on Meeks

782
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:56,000
no one of the attendents
remember seeing them

783
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:00,700
what about that crackhead of Alvin Griffit.
The one have sold Meeks steroids?

784
00:57:00,735 --> 00:57:02,865
We have tap on his phone even
since Meeks escaped

785
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:05,000
no contacts there so far

786
00:57:05,035 --> 00:57:06,100
and sure he is not gonna talk to us

787
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:07,800
what about a warrant to search the house?

788
00:57:07,950 --> 00:57:09,775
You'll get me in the door and he'll talk to me

789
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:10,700
how is your divorce going?

790
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,700
I took your advice, I told my lawyer to settle

791
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:18,400
none of this is the woman in the van

792
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,050
Whoa, I'm trying to suture up here

793
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:22,000
and your ego can handle that?

794
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:25,750
Not but he dosn't likes the other choices

795
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:30,000
because the FBI is wiring hard on me
to take over the tumbprint killer

796
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:34,200
until Meeks is caught, Hawkins is with you

797
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:39,300
nothing personal Hawkins but i don't think
you'll take a bullet for me

798
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:41,800
If I won't take the bullet,
I might push you out the way

799
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:45,200
I'll give two days and I want
a progress report of your divorce

800
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,765
ok, I have all the pieces
for the tumbprint killer

801
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,900
I'm just not looking at the right way

802
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,700
I'll keep the FBI out of it for three days

803
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,100
shh, that is ugly

804
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,600
Mr. Smith wants you to notice
that he's pounding

805
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,300
yes, i know

806
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:31,600
I know you are upset Mr. Smith
and I am sorry.

807
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:34,400
Yeah. I'm upset

808
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:41,300
maybe I was a little brute back,
but let me explain

809
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:45,200
finding someone you think will
be fine to kill, it's a bit like...

810
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:48,300
...it's a bit like fallen in love,

811
00:58:48,301 --> 00:58:51,301
if you mean love you can addict,
you like some of them and they're nice

812
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:53,500
But they are not right

813
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:55,700
and the special one comes alone

814
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:59,700
and your heart... it beats faster

815
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,700
And you know... that's the one.

816
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:07,300
The man in the pick up
not make my heart beat faster

817
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:09,200
Ok

818
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:12,000
the man did't make your heart beat faster.
Then Who?

819
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:14,700
I don't know but i think...

820
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:18,900
...I think I have someone in mind.

821
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:21,600
Do you want me to do some work on it?

822
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:23,600
No, let's just...

823
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:26,400
let's just see how it plays out

824
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:30,900
that's what I'm talking about,
that's my problem.

825
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:34,200
That... that makes me feel
like i'm been joked around

826
00:59:34,201 --> 00:59:36,201
was supposed to be last nigth,
it's not gonna be tonight

827
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:38,700
and now it's, let's see how it plays out?

828
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:40,100
I feel like you're...

829
00:59:40,201 --> 00:59:42,101
I feel like you are begging out our deal

830
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:45,700
- I don't like how that feels
- i promise you

831
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:47,900
I promise you it will happen.

832
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:49,100
When?

833
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:51,900
When it is going to happen?

834
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:53,300
Mr. Brooks, When?

835
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:57,100
Tomorrow night... same time.

836
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:00,600
When you come out from your building,
I want you to turn right...

837
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:04,000
go to the first street that you can go western.

838
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:07,100
I will pick you up... on that street.

839
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:08,300
Ok

840
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:18,500
I wanna do make this, but it can't
end to drags out,
I can change my mind.

841
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,800
Don't you think I wanna do this Mr. Smith?

842
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:26,200
Maybe wrong tempted you have to... Anymore!

843
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,900
Even if that guy was charming and
funny i'll still not like him

844
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:16,400
Hi

845
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:17,800
Hi.

846
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:20,900
What can I do for you?

847
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:23,600
Detective Smolny,
Portland Police Department

848
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:27,000
This is Detective Carfagno,
she is in Palo Alto, California.

849
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:42,300
Emma.

850
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:45,300
! Emma!

851
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:54,100
Did Jane ever told you that there
were a murderer at her school?

852
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:55,500
No.

853
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:56,800
Nothing?

854
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:01,500
Not that her friend died or...
somebody she knew died?

855
01:02:01,540 --> 01:02:04,200
Or some... Somebody in her dorm died?

856
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:07,600
No, why?

857
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:11,400
But there are two Detectives downstairs,
one of them is from Palo Alto

858
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,400
They wanna ask her some questions about a murder
that occurred there shortly before she came home

859
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:17,900
oh... My Gosh,

860
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,700
Well, I'm sure if she was called
to something was murdered

861
01:02:22,701 --> 01:02:23,601
she would have said something.

862
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:24,900
Yeah

863
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:30,100
I called Roger,
he suggest to the criminal attorney.

864
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:33,000
He will be here within a hour.

865
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:37,100
Yeah, I'll get dress.

866
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:42,200
- This is to close.
- I know.

867
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:54,700
Jane, how well did you know Brandon?

868
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:58,700
He and I, we were in a couple of
classes together... that's about it

869
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:01,100
- Did you ever drive him to class?
- No.

870
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:04,600
Did you ever been in his apartment
in or where he lives?

871
01:03:05,235 --> 01:03:07,117
Uh, which complex within...

872
01:03:07,252 --> 01:03:08,400
Have you a BMW, Jane?

873
01:03:09,652 --> 01:03:11,100
Uh, he was actually stolen...

874
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:15,200
Well that was interesting.

875
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:18,200
You know, I don't feel so well

876
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
I think you should lie down, ok?

877
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:23,100
I think she should lie down

878
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:32,065
Dad, I'm sorry I didn't say anything before

879
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,065
It was really horrible but
I don't know the guy that well and...

880
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:41,000
it happens during the same time I found out
I was pregnant, so... just can I...

881
01:04:41,535 --> 01:04:42,350
I understand.

882
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:03,300
Now tell me, what do I do?

883
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:10,100
She did it.

884
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:11,200
Didn't she?

885
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:14,500
Yeah

886
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,900
it'll take the cops a week to ten days
to put the case together and...

887
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:23,700
...and then they will come back
and arrest her.

888
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:31,500
What are you going to do?

889
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:52,100
Oh God!

890
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:54,165
Oh God!

891
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:57,300
Why don't you free this before
she was born.

892
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:01,200
She has...

893
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:02,600
she has what I have

894
01:06:03,935 --> 01:06:05,100
yes, she does.

895
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:09,200
But you're always smarter than her,
she was stupid

896
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:14,100
She did it because she got offered,
ok, I understand

897
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:18,100
She did it for fun, ok, I understand

898
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:25,200
but why didn't she think it through that hatchet
and she left it there?

899
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:32,200
You are pretty graphical today

900
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:34,335
that's the shock of a making a mistake

901
01:06:34,375 --> 01:06:36,900
What does she think I think

902
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:42,400
if she remembers what she told me that the BMW
was been driven across the country by her friend

903
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:45,400
and now rigth...
...she tells the cops that it was stolen

904
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:49,000
you"ll always clean that bathrom,
whatever she did, all her life.

905
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:58,300
It's the BMW. As anything incriminating
I hope it was stolen

906
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:01,800
and she dropped the body on the very d-blake

907
01:07:01,835 --> 01:07:03,800
you think she knows
on this trouble she's in

908
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:09,000
I think... i think she thought
she got noway within,
untill the cops showed up

909
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:18,300
I should've listen to her,
she was trying to tell me, You was there

910
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:22,200
I didn't quit school because I was pregnant

911
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:25,765
I should dog deeper.

912
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,900
And where would you be,
been in exactly the same
place that you are now.

913
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,400
It's not your fault, Earl.

914
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:36,900
Part of your problem with her is
that you always think it is

915
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:41,500
She has what I have, Marshall, so
in a very basic level it is my fault

916
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,100
What are you going to do?

917
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:03,600
Maybe the best thing for her
will be to let her go to jail

918
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:13,500
- what about her child?
- Emma and I will help her to erase it.

919
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:18,800
You might be right Earl, you know?

920
01:08:19,535 --> 01:08:20,500
Just might be

921
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:26,500
Because if she's not stop she is
going to kill again and If she really wants...

922
01:08:26,701 --> 01:08:29,700
...to take over that box business

923
01:08:29,740 --> 01:08:31,400
the next good victim could be...

924
01:08:34,801 --> 01:08:35,501
you

925
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:41,000
I...

926
01:08:42,901 --> 01:08:44,601
I don't think she goes that far.

927
01:08:58,800 --> 01:08:59,300
Hey

928
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,400
We've receive the counter offer

929
01:09:02,001 --> 01:09:03,401
are you sitting down?

930
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:05,065
Yeah, go ahead

931
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:06,800
5 million dollars.

932
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:09,565
My God, you gotta be kidding me

933
01:09:10,366 --> 01:09:11,500
He can't get that, kenny?

934
01:09:11,540 --> 01:09:17,000
No, no, no, my sense of it say that by asking for 5
they hope you settle anywhere between 2,5 and 3

935
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:17,700
shit

936
01:09:17,901 --> 01:09:18,901
Can you stall them?

937
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:23,165
Boh, they know you want this done quickly
so they're gonna expect a quick counter offer

938
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:26,900
Ok, I need two days, just wait 2 days, tell them...

939
01:09:28,001 --> 01:09:30,600
that it's a big number and I have to think about it.

940
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:31,300
OK.

941
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:34,200
Oh, and, uh, that picture that he wanted

942
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:40,300
Tell him I couldn't find it.

943
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:45,900
Yes, Mr. Brooks

944
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:52,800
Mr. Brooks

945
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:55,900
before you open your mouth...

946
01:09:57,701 --> 01:10:00,001
be very sure
this is the right...

947
01:10:00,602 --> 01:10:01,802
thing to do

948
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,600
I will never be sure.

949
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:09,300
You get pissed of me

950
01:10:10,101 --> 01:10:13,601
because I'm always the one
argue to go ahead and do murder.

951
01:10:13,935 --> 01:10:17,200
But not this time,
Earl. This is your decision.

952
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:21,800
I know what's wrong,
I know in my heart it's wrong.

953
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:25,000
Then don't do it.

954
01:10:27,100 --> 01:10:29,300
Go with Mr. Smith and will finish that

955
01:10:30,101 --> 01:10:33,801
and when the police will put Jane in jail,
hope that will save her.

956
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:38,800
And we can happily go on
with our tortured lifes

957
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:41,400
That's exactly what I wanna do

958
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:45,900
That's exactly what I should do
the thing is she is my daughter.

959
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:49,000
And I love her.

960
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:51,500
Mr. Brooks

961
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:59,100
I'm going home.

962
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:03,400
Cancel everything for the rest of the day.

963
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:04,765
I'll take care of it.

964
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:08,800
If you need me, need me, Sunday,
I'll be in my studio.

965
01:11:09,201 --> 01:11:10,201
Call me there.

966
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:15,500
I probably won't pick up, so...
just leave a message.

967
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:18,900
I'll try to not bother you

968
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:52,500
the thing that bothers me about this,
beside the facts we are not prepared and...

969
01:11:54,801 --> 01:11:56,801
a multitude of other things, is...

970
01:11:56,900 --> 01:12:00,800
what this Mr Smith do when he's
walking west tonight and...

971
01:12:01,435 --> 01:12:05,100
...you don't show up, that little
freak and flipped out

972
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,100
I will take care of it

973
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:11,300
On the way to the airport.

974
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:16,200
What are we doing?

975
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:19,800
What are we doing? What are we doing?
You sound like a wining ass kid

976
01:12:19,900 --> 01:12:23,400
- We are playing a hunch.
- We have followed this guy all day.

977
01:12:23,835 --> 01:12:25,200
He is boring, ok?

978
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:27,400
And everything we are running
incomes so clean

979
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:30,000
well, If it didn't it wouldn't be
called a hunch

980
01:12:30,635 --> 01:12:33,300
Meeks, he's the guy we should be
looking for, Meeks.

981
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:37,300
Look where. Please, tell me.

982
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:41,900
Ok, everyone knows who Meeks is
and is looking for him.

983
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:45,500
The chiropactor was the last name to his
all life that I know

984
01:12:45,535 --> 01:12:50,700
We gonna find him now,
there's something is gonna turn him in
we gonna troop over him at the bus stop

985
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:53,100
On the other hand, nobody knows

986
01:12:53,140 --> 01:12:55,300
who the thumbprint killer is or where he is

987
01:12:55,435 --> 01:12:57,567
however I have a fucking hunch.

988
01:12:57,702 --> 01:12:59,301
If this guy, Badford, does

989
01:12:59,436 --> 01:13:01,465
I've got 2 days to play that hunch

990
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:05,100
So if you are thinking you are wasting
your time with me,
thea I'ld be happy to do it alone

991
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:08,650
I had a fight with my wife this morning.

992
01:13:09,185 --> 01:13:10,200
What's your problem?

993
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,900
My husband wants 5 million dollars

994
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:25,400
here you are Sir

995
01:13:26,035 --> 01:13:27,000
Sir?

996
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:31,000
Thank you.

997
01:13:37,900 --> 01:13:40,900
God grant me the serenity
to accept the things that I cannot change

998
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:45,400
courage to change the things that I can
and the wisdom to know the difference...

999
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:39,400
it's for you asshole

1000
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:48,200
remember me?

1001
01:14:48,801 --> 01:14:50,801
Can you step out of the car, please?
I wanna talk to you.

1002
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:58,500
So, Mr Bafford what is it
you have to tell me?

1003
01:14:58,835 --> 01:15:00,465
What do you mean?
Li don't have anything to tell you

1004
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:03,400
Really?
Because I was driving around and

1005
01:15:03,401 --> 01:15:06,401
I suddenly got this
feeling that you have something to tell me

1006
01:15:06,441 --> 01:15:07,300
about the murders

1007
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:09,000
No.

1008
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:10,965
Nothing.

1009
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:12,400
Oh, that is disappointing.

1010
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:17,600
Because... when I've left after we...
we talked last time

1011
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,800
I felt like I've missed the clue
that was right on front of me

1012
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:22,300
That can solve this whole case.

1013
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:25,400
I don't know why you feel that

1014
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:32,100
can you tell me that, uh, you are an amateur
powder that you like to make balls and vases?

1015
01:15:32,135 --> 01:15:32,700
No.

1016
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:38,500
I told you that my hobby was
photography and not... powdery.

1017
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:41,900
Oh, maybe, maybe that was it

1018
01:15:43,700 --> 01:15:46,900
Flight attender upstairs says that the victims
like to keep their bedroom curtains...

1019
01:15:47,301 --> 01:15:48,601
open when they had sex.

1020
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:53,500
Can I see some of the photos
you took that couple?

1021
01:16:16,700 --> 01:16:18,965
You harassing me, Detective Atwood.

1022
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:24,100
You know very well that I'm not a powder
and I don't have any pictures.

1023
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:28,200
So my feeling is that your feeling is wrong
and you should just move your car
and let me go home

1024
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:33,900
What's your job here?
What... what would you do?

1025
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:36,800
I am a mechanical engineer.

1026
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:40,400
Uh, you gotta be really smart for that.
Don't ya?

1027
01:16:41,235 --> 01:16:41,900
Yes

1028
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:44,900
Then be smart Mr. Bafford

1029
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:49,000
because you lie to me,
right there in the end

1030
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:52,500
I'll be watching you

1031
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:56,400
When you wanna tell me the truth
you gotta get in touch with me.

1032
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:58,700
See you later al gator.

1033
01:17:13,900 --> 01:17:16,700
Gotta Lister to get us a search
warrant for Meeks Doctor

1034
01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:18,400
That's good.

1035
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:20,465
God, Damned, this guy knows something.

1036
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:23,100
Almost told me that something happened.

1037
01:17:23,235 --> 01:17:23,900
You think he did it?

1038
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:27,100
I don't think is quiet that simple

1039
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:29,600
Do you wanna call for backup?

1040
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:31,700
Yeah, I wish to be ready for anything

1041
01:17:31,701 --> 01:17:33,501
infact I'll get a cane and I'll chop, rigth now...

1042
01:17:33,502 --> 01:17:36,702
I don't have the energy to chase this guy
if he'll decide to run

1043
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:17,900
"put your hands on top of your head"

1044
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:23,500
Clear

1045
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:28,750
Meeks was a steroids freak

1046
01:18:28,985 --> 01:18:31,000
this is what is ususally fall...
tempting now

1047
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:33,400
You think Meeks is having with him?

1048
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:36,600
I think he have turned the man... on me!

1049
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:31,900
Hawkins, we have here... Griffin

1050
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:43,500
How do you feel?

1051
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:48,600
Dirty

1052
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:50,700
It's understandable.

1053
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:56,000
You never killed for this reason before,
the feeling will pass

1054
01:20:56,235 --> 01:20:57,200
I don't think so.

1055
01:20:58,600 --> 01:20:59,850
It's the whole thing, Marshall

1056
01:21:01,085 --> 01:21:04,600
If i can fly away... suggest in the hole

1057
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:07,800
...disappear, where there's
absolutely no trace of me.

1058
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:12,500
Because eventually I will get caught doing this
It would be very embarrassing for me.

1059
01:21:13,135 --> 01:21:14,200
And Emma and Jane.

1060
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:16,700
So I have been thinking.

1061
01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:22,500
Is there a way that Mr. Smith
could kill me and make me disappear?

1062
01:21:25,900 --> 01:21:29,100
Rule nr.1, Mr. Smith is not
smart enough to do that

1063
01:21:29,135 --> 01:21:29,865
I know that

1064
01:21:29,900 --> 01:21:34,900
nr. 2 there is not reason, if you are careful.
To believe you will ever get caught.

1065
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:40,100
I know that I will have to plan it for Mr Smith but
I think...

1066
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:43,065
I think, that is what I wanna do

1067
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:47,200
Well, I'm not particulary fine at that plan, Earl

1068
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:51,700
Remember? If you die, I'll go with you
and I'd like being alive. I like...

1069
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,700
eating, I like fucking, I like killing.

1070
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:00,400
I have to end it, Marshal...
one way or another...

1071
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:03,100
...and I think this is the best way

1072
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,200
Fuck you then!

1073
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:39,700
- Hi
- Hi

1074
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:41,265
You worked late?

1075
01:22:41,300 --> 01:22:44,100
Yes, I had, I guess, 4 parts.
It's to 2,honey

1076
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:45,600
blacked money

1077
01:22:46,601 --> 01:22:47,401
will be fine

1078
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:58,400
Mercies... I'd love Jane is in grace
and I'm trying to get right

1079
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:26,400
Ehy Daddy,
i thought you've been gone already

1080
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:32,400
Roger called... there was another
murder last night at your school.

1081
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:35,900
Yeah

1082
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:39,000
gone in the same way they
talked to you about

1083
01:23:39,135 --> 01:23:42,400
right down to the hatched
been left at the scene.

1084
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
They think they have a serial killer

1085
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:52,800
obviously you were here last night so,
you are in the clear.

1086
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:55,400
Well, it's...

1087
01:23:56,601 --> 01:23:58,101
it's a good new isn't it? I mean...

1088
01:23:58,900 --> 01:24:01,900
...even if you are innocent it's good to know
you are not a suspect

1089
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:05,200
yeah, uh

1090
01:24:05,700 --> 01:24:09,300
how's the... how's the morning sickness?

1091
01:24:10,700 --> 01:24:13,700
Uh...
Better than yesterday.

1092
01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:17,600
Do you wanna have lunch with me today?

1093
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:22,500
I'd love to but i don't know how i will feel later

1094
01:24:24,201 --> 01:24:24,701
Thank you

1095
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:41,800
Do you love me, Jane?

1096
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,700
Of course I love you, daddy.

1097
01:24:46,535 --> 01:24:47,500
You are my father.

1098
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:58,400
Have you decided whether or
not to have the baby?

1099
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:01,000
Not yet.

1100
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:45,200
It's time to go

1101
01:25:51,700 --> 01:25:54,765
Dear Emma and Jane, my loves

1102
01:25:56,400 --> 01:26:01,400
I have a terminal illness and instead of
subjecting you to my deterioration

1103
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:04,800
I have decided to disappear.

1104
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:08,965
Not try to find me, i don't wanna be found.

1105
01:26:09,700 --> 01:26:12,200
Please, believe that the time
I've spent with you

1106
01:26:12,835 --> 01:26:15,200
brought me the greatest joy of my life.

1107
01:26:17,100 --> 01:26:20,000
Iove, dad.

1108
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:25,200
So you are going to go through with it?

1109
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:29,800
It's all planned to work out

1110
01:26:43,900 --> 01:26:47,500
- ready to rock and roll Mr. Smith?
- Yeah

1111
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:00,700
I smell gun oil,

1112
01:27:02,101 --> 01:27:03,501
different gun oil than yours

1113
01:27:04,700 --> 01:27:05,700
He brought his gun,

1114
01:27:07,701 --> 01:27:10,101
if i forget what he wants,
he plans to kill me

1115
01:27:10,700 --> 01:27:15,300
Oh, now I get it.
You're counting on this

1116
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:17,400
yes, it's a sort of lottery

1117
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:24,100
but if you plan last to having kill you,
how do you have to kill somebody else first?

1118
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:28,700
I'd live to see that he got the courage to kill me

1119
01:27:30,900 --> 01:27:33,000
not even you believe that, Earl.

1120
01:27:34,300 --> 01:27:35,400
This make it more exciting,

1121
01:27:35,435 --> 01:27:36,165
this's not?

1122
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,300
I think he's gonna kill you
after you killed somebody else

1123
01:27:39,335 --> 01:27:41,200
you get it in you rocks on, big time

1124
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:43,765
that's why you are doing this?

1125
01:27:44,100 --> 01:27:45,700
Not true and if it would?

1126
01:27:46,535 --> 01:27:48,500
So what?

1127
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:55,800
Hello.

1128
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:57,300
Yeah, put him through

1129
01:27:58,100 --> 01:27:59,200
I just got your message

1130
01:28:00,935 --> 01:28:03,300
the weird thing is that they
close that courtains

1131
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:07,700
at first they were open as they always were
and they were make love like they always do

1132
01:28:08,100 --> 01:28:10,400
when i had a look again, the curtains were closed

1133
01:28:10,401 --> 01:28:13,901
and there were what look like camera flashes
coming from behind the curtains

1134
01:28:14,300 --> 01:28:15,300
Camera Flashes?

1135
01:28:15,335 --> 01:28:16,417
That what's that look like

1136
01:28:17,252 --> 01:28:18,800
That's why he poses them

1137
01:28:19,700 --> 01:28:20,200
I'm sorry?

1138
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:21,700
No, no, no, nothing

1139
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:25,000
look, the guy you should talk with
it's the guy at the floor below us

1140
01:28:25,135 --> 01:28:26,600
would that be, Mr Bafford?

1141
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:31,500
Yeah, he told me once that he did take
some great pictures of that
couple making love

1142
01:28:31,900 --> 01:28:33,300
He is the one you should talk to

1143
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,200
Ok, great, thank you.

1144
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:41,800
Yeah?

1145
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:44,700
Hawkins, meet me at Bafford apartment
with a search warrant.

1146
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:53,800
Put this on.

1147
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:05,400
Nice half hand.

1148
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:18,200
Try I couple of deep breathes
through your nose.

1149
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:23,900
- I have to take a crap so bad.
- What?

1150
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:26,300
I have to take a crap.

1151
01:29:28,700 --> 01:29:29,900
We won't be long

1152
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:06,700
I've talked with your wife lawyer

1153
01:30:07,735 --> 01:30:09,500
they are thinking about the 5 million

1154
01:30:24,100 --> 01:30:26,700
realisticly.
How much you think we can get?

1155
01:30:27,135 --> 01:30:31,200
Oh, If we go court, that case scenario, 2

1156
01:30:31,240 --> 01:30:33,700
I think we should all fair to 3

1157
01:30:35,100 --> 01:30:40,800
it's not get biggish?
2.5, 2.7, still be a great deal

1158
01:30:47,300 --> 01:30:48,600
There's more if you want

1159
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:51,950
We have to do this quickly.

1160
01:30:52,051 --> 01:30:54,051
Remember?
Morice's meeting us here

1161
01:30:55,552 --> 01:30:56,052
yes

1162
01:30:58,985 --> 01:31:00,000
That's good he join us

1163
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,000
it's not funny

1164
01:31:08,300 --> 01:31:09,800
are we alone?

1165
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:12,800
Yeah

1166
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:25,100
Hello.

1167
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:34,300
Do it... do it

1168
01:31:34,301 --> 01:31:35,401
[screaming]

1169
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:37,500
Don't do that

1170
01:31:37,801 --> 01:31:38,701
[screaming]

1171
01:31:39,502 --> 01:31:40,502
[Screaming]

1172
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:42,500
Mr. Baffor

1173
01:31:44,901 --> 01:31:45,601
Mr. Baffor

1174
01:31:46,900 --> 01:31:49,000
Yes, uuuhhh, yes

1175
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:51,600
yes, you are the fucking man

1176
01:31:52,300 --> 01:31:55,200
oh, man, do You see the look on their face

1177
01:31:55,900 --> 01:31:58,800
the look on their fucking face, was great

1178
01:31:59,535 --> 01:32:00,800
It was great, it's fantastic.

1179
01:32:01,401 --> 01:32:02,001
That was...

1180
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:06,100
everything that I, I, hoped, it would be

1181
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,200
- Thank you.
- You're welcome

1182
01:32:12,300 --> 01:32:14,700
Mr. Bafford, I've knocked

1183
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:20,600
anybody home?

1184
01:32:28,900 --> 01:32:30,900
Mr. Bafford.

1185
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,600
Hello

1186
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:02,065
Obviously Bafford is gone. Ehi...

1187
01:33:02,105 --> 01:33:02,145
Obviously Bafford is gone.

1188
01:33:02,185 --> 01:33:04,500
God damn Hawkins,
don't you ever knock?

1189
01:33:04,540 --> 01:33:06,400
I wasn't able to get a search warrant

1190
01:33:06,440 --> 01:33:09,000
but maybe we just got lucky,
this is the moving company work order

1191
01:33:09,035 --> 01:33:11,500
and this upset is the address
where they are taking the Baffor's stuff

1192
01:33:12,235 --> 01:33:13,000
Where you were when you called me?

1193
01:33:13,735 --> 01:33:14,765
I was at home, in bed.

1194
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:16,065
Can you prove that?

1195
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:20,000
I was at home, in bed.
Why do i need to prove that?

1196
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:24,200
Your husband Jesse and his
lawyer were killed tonight.

1197
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:29,100
Get the fuck out

1198
01:33:30,900 --> 01:33:32,265
looks like the thumbprint killer

1199
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:35,800
I have an order to bring you in for questioning

1200
01:33:36,900 --> 01:33:38,300
why?

1201
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:43,000
I did't want Jesse dead. Ok, I hate
what he was doing to me but I
didn't want him dead

1202
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:44,800
their own record just said that you
wanted him dead.

1203
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,200
Who better can fake the thumbprint
killer than you?

1204
01:33:48,900 --> 01:33:50,700
You don't actually believe I did that

1205
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:54,600
our job had told us anything, Tracy,
is there people do strange things.

1206
01:33:55,101 --> 01:33:56,500
They just wanna ask you some questions.

1207
01:33:56,540 --> 01:33:59,200
And I will gonna answer those questions
after we got check out this addresses.

1208
01:33:59,240 --> 01:34:00,200
- I have to take the wind
- Look

1209
01:34:00,235 --> 01:34:03,865
this address is the answer for the thumbprint
killer and this is where I'm going

1210
01:34:04,100 --> 01:34:06,800
don't make me cuff you
because I will if I have to

1211
01:34:08,001 --> 01:34:08,501
ehy, ehy

1212
01:34:14,200 --> 01:34:15,765
it'd be really nice if you can go with me

1213
01:34:16,100 --> 01:34:18,700
...but if you do and this goes bad
they gonna burn your ass

1214
01:34:19,335 --> 01:34:20,217
So this never happened

1215
01:34:20,252 --> 01:34:21,365
you're nuts

1216
01:34:21,700 --> 01:34:22,800
yeah, that's what they say

1217
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:28,400
here comes the gun

1218
01:34:29,435 --> 01:34:30,100
yep

1219
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:34,600
what are you doing?

1220
01:34:35,900 --> 01:34:37,700
You are smart enough to figure
that out, Mr. Brooks

1221
01:34:38,435 --> 01:34:40,900
Well, we are going 65 miles/hour, Mr. Smith

1222
01:34:40,901 --> 01:34:43,700
if you shoot me now,
there's good chance that we both died.

1223
01:34:43,740 --> 01:34:46,000
Not now.
Take this next out, friend

1224
01:34:48,100 --> 01:34:49,200
You mean this one?

1225
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:54,300
That wouldn't be very smart,
I mean i wouldn't

1226
01:34:59,500 --> 01:35:01,000
think about this now, nuts

1227
01:35:01,900 --> 01:35:05,900
You piss yourself back, you left your DNA
at the scene of a double homicide

1228
01:35:05,940 --> 01:35:08,900
and there's nothing to indicate that
i was ever there

1229
01:35:10,335 --> 01:35:13,400
then the cops do the analysys of that urine
and then will...

1230
01:35:14,335 --> 01:35:16,200
...you are the thumbprint killer

1231
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:22,065
no, no. I have pictures of you
from the first murder

1232
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:24,800
yes, but what you was doing at
the second murder

1233
01:35:26,001 --> 01:35:26,401
uh?

1234
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:31,100
Let me help you with the fly

1235
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:34,900
you say that I've forced you to come along

1236
01:35:34,935 --> 01:35:35,965
and if I'm not here,

1237
01:35:37,066 --> 01:35:38,766
more specifically my body is not here

1238
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:41,800
to say otherwise you might have a
chance to spit in a rehab

1239
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:44,900
let me ask for yourself.
Why would I help you

1240
01:35:46,735 --> 01:35:49,200
Well, I'm tired... Mr. Smith.

1241
01:35:49,435 --> 01:35:50,465
I am tired of killing.

1242
01:35:50,500 --> 01:35:54,700
But I'm an addict. I can't quit.
I've tried but I cannot do it on my own

1243
01:35:54,740 --> 01:35:56,200
So I need you to kill me.

1244
01:35:56,900 --> 01:36:00,300
But I need it if you do it smart.
I want in a way I will disappear

1245
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,400
and my family never knows what I was.

1246
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:06,600
How?

1247
01:36:07,100 --> 01:36:08,400
How do i fucking do that?

1248
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:14,100
There's a cemetery I know about

1249
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:20,400
We'll find an open grave,
you shoot me

1250
01:36:21,035 --> 01:36:22,400
I'll fall into the grave.

1251
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:26,365
You'll shovel just enough earth...
to cover me

1252
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:30,500
tomorrow, a casket is lowered on to me
and I'll disappear.

1253
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:32,900
It's a good plan, don't you think?

1254
01:36:36,300 --> 01:36:38,900
Why?
Why should I trust you?

1255
01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:44,200
You don't have to trust me Mr. Smith
you are the man holding the gun

1256
01:36:44,935 --> 01:36:47,300
you saw me put mine in
the trap, remember?

1257
01:36:52,300 --> 01:36:53,000
I know

1258
01:36:55,300 --> 01:36:56,600
You really want me to kill you?

1259
01:37:00,500 --> 01:37:01,200
Yes

1260
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:06,400
ok, ok

1261
01:37:08,100 --> 01:37:09,100
But one sad move

1262
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:12,165
I'll drop

1263
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:15,600
and I'll make sure that your family
knows where you are

1264
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:21,100
I understand.

1265
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:34,300
You come down or what Mr. Bafford?

1266
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:48,800
Take your hand.
Are you parked very slow

1267
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,400
you don't wanna climb over, do you?

1268
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:56,300
What you do with the
key of a cemetery?

1269
01:37:57,900 --> 01:37:58,700
I own it.

1270
01:38:00,900 --> 01:38:01,965
Why do you own a cemetery?

1271
01:38:02,300 --> 01:38:05,200
I always want invest in things
people can do without

1272
01:38:05,335 --> 01:38:08,300
water and cemeteries?
Pretty safe bets.

1273
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:13,800
Here

1274
01:38:15,201 --> 01:38:16,501
you'll need this to get out

1275
01:39:56,700 --> 01:39:58,600
yes, I would

1276
01:39:59,300 --> 01:40:00,900
I wanna show you something.

1277
01:40:24,300 --> 01:40:25,100
Ok

1278
01:40:27,200 --> 01:40:28,100
Here we are

1279
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:34,900
Ok

1280
01:40:35,700 --> 01:40:40,000
how if, uh, I stand here and
you stand there

1281
01:40:40,700 --> 01:40:42,600
at... at, too far away

1282
01:40:43,500 --> 01:40:46,500
And you shoot me... I should

1283
01:40:47,300 --> 01:40:50,100
I should fall straight back into this hole.

1284
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,300
You don't think I have the
guts to this to you?

1285
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:58,200
No, i'm hoping you do Mr. Smith,

1286
01:40:59,101 --> 01:41:00,201
i'm hoping you do

1287
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:04,900
ok, let's...

1288
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
...let's get this over with

1289
01:41:19,800 --> 01:41:21,200
I'll close my eyes.

1290
01:41:45,700 --> 01:41:47,700
I'm sorry Mr. Smith.

1291
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,500
I really did want you to kill me.

1292
01:41:54,500 --> 01:41:58,300
But in case, the last minute
I've changed my mind.

1293
01:41:59,100 --> 01:42:01,100
I've returned to your apartment.

1294
01:42:01,700 --> 01:42:04,700
And I've been to firing pin on your gun

1295
01:42:06,900 --> 01:42:10,600
Infact I even brought another one for
you to use if you couldn't finish me

1296
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:14,200
If I had decided to go through with it.

1297
01:42:15,800 --> 01:42:19,200
Unfortunately for You.
My daughter is pregnant.

1298
01:42:19,900 --> 01:42:26,700
And just before you pulled that trigger I realize
how much I wanna see the end of that story

1299
01:42:28,300 --> 01:42:31,800
you don't even hear me,
the cops will gonna find those pictures.

1300
01:42:32,100 --> 01:42:34,000
They will know that you kill that couple.

1301
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:37,900
The contents of your safety
deposit box Mr. Smith?

1302
01:42:41,100 --> 01:42:42,300
I'm vanished

1303
01:42:46,900 --> 01:42:48,600
that's hurt, isn't it?

1304
01:42:49,300 --> 01:42:50,900
No, please

1305
01:43:14,600 --> 01:43:17,200
before I was the thumbprint killer,
Mr. Smith

1306
01:43:19,100 --> 01:43:20,900
I have killed a lot of people.

1307
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:23,500
In a lot of different ways.

1308
01:44:05,200 --> 01:44:08,000
It's says that the thumbprint killer
is a monster

1309
01:44:09,900 --> 01:44:12,100
annoying you a little bit, you
can't take credit, doesn't it?

1310
01:44:13,100 --> 01:44:14,500
No.

1311
01:44:15,300 --> 01:44:18,200
Anyone who's got what they do,
wants credit

1312
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:20,800
since I'm not going to do it anymore

1313
01:44:21,400 --> 01:44:24,600
I'd like Mr. Smith have the credit

1314
01:44:26,600 --> 01:44:28,900
don't kid yourself,
Earl. You are going to kill again

1315
01:44:29,400 --> 01:44:30,700
No, I am not

1316
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:35,600
I'm going back to tha AA meetings
and I will control it.

1317
01:44:45,200 --> 01:44:48,100
But there is an answer I
would like to have.

1318
01:44:52,100 --> 01:44:53,100
Atwood?

1319
01:44:53,200 --> 01:44:55,000
Why you are a cop?

1320
01:44:55,035 --> 01:44:56,500
Who is this?

1321
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:02,200
You are rich, you have good education,
you could have gone into your father's business,
instead you...

1322
01:45:02,235 --> 01:45:05,565
went outside, all of them became successful
on your own, why?

1323
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:09,100
If you want something from me
then you gonna have to tell me who you are...

1324
01:45:09,135 --> 01:45:10,465
...or I'm gonna hang up

1325
01:45:10,500 --> 01:45:13,200
did you think that your husband's
killing was random?

1326
01:45:13,700 --> 01:45:16,400
And I suddenly didn't have to
give you Meeks

1327
01:45:16,435 --> 01:45:18,100
Mr. Bafford?

1328
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:20,300
Which is the answer?

1329
01:45:20,700 --> 01:45:22,200
You not sound like you?

1330
01:45:23,700 --> 01:45:27,400
Well, I have a little cold
are you going to gimme the answer?

1331
01:45:28,100 --> 01:45:29,500
Where are you?

1332
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:33,400
I'll tell you if you can give me
the true answer to my question

1333
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:48,700
My... My father was very disappointed
that I was born a girl

1334
01:45:48,735 --> 01:45:50,400
And he let me know it

1335
01:45:51,900 --> 01:45:54,500
I spent my all life trying to prove
him wrong

1336
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:58,200
Thank you.

1337
01:45:58,835 --> 01:45:59,565
Wait...

1338
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:01,800
you... you promised to tell me
where you are?

1339
01:46:02,235 --> 01:46:03,400
Me?

1340
01:46:05,100 --> 01:46:07,100
I am on top of a building.

1341
01:46:12,950 --> 01:46:14,800
That wasn't Bafford.

1342
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:41,900
Jane!

1343
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:44,600
Jane!

1344
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:47,100
Wake up, wake up!

1345
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:56,100
I woke you up?

1346
01:48:56,800 --> 01:48:58,000
It's ok

1347
01:48:58,800 --> 01:48:59,200
it's ok

1348
01:49:02,100 --> 01:49:04,200
I'm here... go back to sleep

1349
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:13,300
why did you fight it so hard, Earl?
