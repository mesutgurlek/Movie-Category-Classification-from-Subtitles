1
00:00:00,034 --> 00:00:00,734
<i>Previously on "weeds"...</i>

2
00:00:01,934 --> 00:00:03,567
my cover business...
what about a bakery?

3
00:00:03,634 --> 00:00:05,567
These will satisfy
your munchies

4
00:00:05,634 --> 00:00:08,034
and give you a long-lasting,
all-body high.

5
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,734
I'm ready to take orders.
Fuck it.
I'll take it all.

6
00:00:10,801 --> 00:00:12,534
Last week's buy,
this week's buy.

7
00:00:12,601 --> 00:00:14,467
My ring, my rover.

8
00:00:14,534 --> 00:00:16,901
You're still short for all
you're gonna want this week.

9
00:00:16,968 --> 00:00:18,200
I'll be back.

10
00:00:18,267 --> 00:00:20,100
I don't like dealing
with things.

11
00:00:20,167 --> 00:00:22,034
I prefer to pretend
they don't exist.

12
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,801
Silas: Megan. Hey, megan.

13
00:00:23,867 --> 00:00:26,534
Megan, can you hear me?

14
00:00:26,601 --> 00:00:29,334
Celia: That deaf girl
down on dewey street.

15
00:00:38,567 --> 00:00:41,701
* little boxes on the hillside *

16
00:00:41,767 --> 00:00:44,334
* little boxes
made of ticky-tacky *

17
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,001
* little boxes on the hillside *

18
00:00:47,068 --> 00:00:49,001
* little boxes all the same *

19
00:00:49,068 --> 00:00:52,068
* there's a green one
and a pink one *

20
00:00:52,133 --> 00:00:54,801
* and a blue one
and a yellow one *

21
00:00:54,867 --> 00:00:56,767
* and they're all made out
of ticky-tacky *

22
00:00:56,834 --> 00:01:01,167
* and they all look
the same *

23
00:01:01,233 --> 00:01:03,767
* and the people in the houses *

24
00:01:03,834 --> 00:01:06,567

25
00:01:06,634 --> 00:01:08,901

26

* and they came out
all the same *

27
00:01:11,734 --> 00:01:14,334

28

00:01:19,767 --> 00:01:23,968
* and they all look
just the same *

31
00:02:09,634 --> 00:02:12,801
Fire! Mom, what are you doing?
There's a fire!

32
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:15,534
If there's a fire,
i'll run, okay?

33
00:02:15,601 --> 00:02:17,400
Otherwise, i'm gonna bash in
the smoke alarm

34
00:02:17,467 --> 00:02:19,334
with a broom handle.

35
00:02:24,034 --> 00:02:24,968
Andy?

36
00:02:25,034 --> 00:02:26,267
Sorry, pants.

37
00:02:26,334 --> 00:02:27,801
I was trying
to surprise you guys.

38
00:02:27,867 --> 00:02:29,200
Uncle andy!

39
00:02:29,267 --> 00:02:31,367
Hey, guys. Ohhhh!

40
00:02:31,434 --> 00:02:34,200
Yes, i'm diggin' the love.

41
00:02:34,267 --> 00:02:35,701
Oh, i missed you.

42
00:02:35,767 --> 00:02:36,801
How was alaska?

43
00:02:36,867 --> 00:02:39,601
Alaska was so beautiful.

44
00:02:39,667 --> 00:02:41,601
In the summer,
you could party all night.

45
00:02:41,667 --> 00:02:43,500
Then it got dark,
and i met this psycho girl

46
00:02:43,567 --> 00:02:45,200
who tried to bring me up
on charges...

47
00:02:45,267 --> 00:02:46,934
how did you
get in here?

48
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:49,300
I'll pay for the window.
I didn't want to wake you.

49
00:02:49,367 --> 00:02:51,934
I... uh, i'm joking, i'm joking,
i'm joking, i'm joking!

50
00:02:52,001 --> 00:02:54,968
Oh, hey, you guys want
to help me make breakfast?

51
00:02:56,233 --> 00:02:58,200
Shane, i need you
making the coffee.

52
00:02:59,967 --> 00:03:02,833
Sorry about the grease fire.
That bacon really spits up.

53
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,167
Shane, go get a broom

54
00:03:04,234 --> 00:03:06,434
so i can bash
your uncle andy with it.

55
00:03:06,501 --> 00:03:10,100
Come on, nancy pantsy.
I'm making eggs florentine.

56
00:03:10,167 --> 00:03:12,267
Don't call me "pants."
Pantalones?

57
00:03:12,334 --> 00:03:14,100
Oh, shit. You?

58
00:03:14,167 --> 00:03:15,401
Hey, lupita.

59
00:03:15,467 --> 00:03:17,434
I know you missed me.
How about a hug?

60
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:19,933
I'm no cleaning up
this mess.

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,167
Uncle andy,
did you bring us anything?

62
00:03:22,234 --> 00:03:24,000
Of course!
Look who you're talking to.

63
00:03:24,067 --> 00:03:27,167
Get my duffel in the guest room.
The black one, not the green.

64
00:03:27,234 --> 00:03:29,601
Stay out of the green.
Guest room? Guest room.

65
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:32,234
Uh, i guess
i could sleep with lupita.

66
00:03:32,301 --> 00:03:34,467
I do love
the fiery latinas.

67
00:03:34,534 --> 00:03:36,134
Ugh.

68
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,367
Know this, lupita.

69
00:03:37,434 --> 00:03:38,900
Until you learn to love me,

70
00:03:38,967 --> 00:03:41,701
i got enough love
for both of us.

71
00:03:41,768 --> 00:03:45,067
How did you and judah emerge
from the same woman?

72
00:03:45,134 --> 00:03:49,067
I know! What family gets blessed
with not one, but two studs?

73
00:03:49,134 --> 00:03:50,434
Everybody gather.

74
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:54,768
First, young silas,
that's for you.

75
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,701
Oh! Awesome.

76
00:03:56,768 --> 00:03:57,967
So, does it work?

77
00:03:58,034 --> 00:03:59,301
Yeah.
For three weeks.

78
00:03:59,367 --> 00:04:00,967
Then scratch off
the serial number

79
00:04:01,034 --> 00:04:02,467
and get
a new service plan.

80
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:03,933
Okay. For mama...

81
00:04:07,367 --> 00:04:09,200
shane: What's that?

82
00:04:09,267 --> 00:04:10,534
For your neck, right?

83
00:04:10,601 --> 00:04:12,534
You're always talking about
how your neck hurts.

84
00:04:12,601 --> 00:04:14,800
Take it.

85
00:04:14,867 --> 00:04:17,900
For my neck.
Of course. Thank you.

86
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:19,601
Lupita.

87
00:04:19,668 --> 00:04:23,334
I'll put it in your bedroom
next to the little one.

88
00:04:23,401 --> 00:04:24,334
What about me?!

89
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:27,167
Oh, i don't, uh...

90
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:28,567
oh!

91
00:04:28,634 --> 00:04:29,900
The best for last.

92
00:04:29,967 --> 00:04:31,234
No! No way!

93
00:04:31,301 --> 00:04:32,734
I'll teach him
how to use them.

94
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,234
Shane li,
hand them over.

95
00:04:34,301 --> 00:04:36,067
Andy!

96
00:04:36,134 --> 00:04:38,768
I'll hold on to those
till we're in a better space.

97
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,933
Who's hungry?
Everybody go sit down.

98
00:04:46,967 --> 00:04:48,800
Andy...

99
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,501
how long you
planning on staying?

100
00:04:51,567 --> 00:04:53,534
Don't worry.
I'll help out.

101
00:04:53,601 --> 00:04:54,800
How long?

102
00:04:54,867 --> 00:04:57,967
Just till i figure
some things out.

103
00:04:58,034 --> 00:05:01,501
Like?
I don't know.
My life.

104
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,967
Sure. That.

105
00:05:05,034 --> 00:05:08,701
Good to see you,
pants.

106
00:05:08,768 --> 00:05:11,000
It's good
to be with family.

107
00:05:11,067 --> 00:05:14,034
Come on, let's eat.

108
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,467
Hey, buddy.
Whatcha doing?

109
00:05:16,534 --> 00:05:18,668
Just iming
my girlfriend.

110
00:05:18,734 --> 00:05:21,301
You don't need a credit card
for that, do you?

111
00:05:21,367 --> 00:05:23,567
No. Real girlfriend.

112
00:05:23,634 --> 00:05:25,567
Megan. She's deaf.

113
00:05:25,634 --> 00:05:28,867
Deaf megan.
Is she cute?

114
00:05:28,933 --> 00:05:32,668
Yeah.
She's totally cute.

115
00:05:32,734 --> 00:05:34,567
Oh, yeah.

116
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:38,034
She doesn't look deaf.
She can't hear anything?

117
00:05:38,034 --> 00:05:39,833
That's what deaf mns. Ea

118
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,334
man, how did you get so smart
at, what, 16?

119
00:05:43,401 --> 00:05:45,334
Took me years to learn

120
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:47,601
slightly defective chicks
are the way to go.

121
00:05:47,668 --> 00:05:50,034
I once went out with this girl
with a baby arm...

122
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,867
insane in the sack.

123
00:05:51,933 --> 00:05:54,367
Plus, when she grabbed my dick
with her little hand,

124
00:05:54,434 --> 00:05:55,567
it looked gigantic.

125
00:05:57,034 --> 00:05:58,367
So how do you
talk to her?

126
00:05:58,434 --> 00:06:00,900
Uh, we just mostly
haut and stuff.

127
00:06:00,967 --> 00:06:02,434
You should learn braille.

128
00:06:02,501 --> 00:06:04,833
You mean sign language?
[Laughing]
Whatever.

129
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,034
What's this?

130
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,067
Ugh. That's mine.

131
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:09,668
"Chris died for your sins."

132
00:06:09,734 --> 00:06:11,034
Is that a joke?
Yeah, on me.

133
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,000
At's what happens when you
outsource to fucking malaya.

134
00:06:14,067 --> 00:06:16,800
8-year-olds in a sweatshop
can't spell for shit.

135
00:06:16,867 --> 00:06:20,167
I was trying to jump on board
the red-state-jesus thing...

136
00:06:20,234 --> 00:06:21,833
the fashion of the christ.

137
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,768
I
upend with 3,000 of these.

138
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,067
Totally useless!

139
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:27,267
If there's one thing
about the christ crowd...

140
00:06:27,334 --> 00:06:29,467
absolutely no
sense of humor.

141
00:06:29,534 --> 00:06:31,900
I should have gone after
the jew market.

142
00:06:31,967 --> 00:06:33,768
Leaat
we can take a joke.

143
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:36,134
Come on, shane.

144
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:42,833
Look who's here.

145
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,668
Baby, it's "the early bird
gets the worm," not the weed.

146
00:06:46,734 --> 00:06:49,067
You need to read up
on your bartlett's.

147
00:06:49,134 --> 00:06:51,367
My brother-in-law
took the kids to school,

148
00:06:51,434 --> 00:06:53,367
i thought
i'd get a jump on the day.

149
00:06:53,434 --> 00:06:54,933
You want some oatmeal?

150
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,134
No. Andy made
eggs florentine.

151
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,734
Andy?

152
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,301
When did that fancy-cooking
trouble get back in town?

153
00:07:02,367 --> 00:07:04,800
This morning i woke up,
and there he was.

154
00:07:04,867 --> 00:07:08,800
Mm. Sort of like crotch crabs
only not as treatable, huh?

155
00:07:09,467 --> 00:07:11,734
I forgot you know him.

156
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,301
Been hoping
to forget him.

157
00:07:13,368 --> 00:07:15,001
How did andy
adconrand meet?

158
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:17,700
I never got a straight answer
out of either of them.

159
00:07:17,767 --> 00:07:19,734
They worked
at circuit city together,

160
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,800
got caught stealing together,
got fired together.

161
00:07:22,867 --> 00:07:24,268
They go way back.

162
00:07:24,334 --> 00:07:26,533
I never should have
let that boy work retail.

163
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,101
You gonna need
to come back later

164
00:07:28,167 --> 00:07:29,901
'cause we ain't got in
everything yet.

165
00:07:29,967 --> 00:07:31,934
I got 17 food orders
to fill.

166
00:07:32,001 --> 00:07:34,167
Ooh! Listen
to betty cracker.

167
00:07:34,234 --> 00:07:36,433
You got bunches
of that crap last time.

168
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,834
You out already?

169
00:07:37,901 --> 00:07:40,201
I've got some, but not enough
for what i need.

170
00:07:40,268 --> 00:07:41,867
My crowd loves
to eat their smoke.

171
00:07:41,934 --> 00:07:43,934
I could hook you up
with a little schwag

172
00:07:44,001 --> 00:07:45,268
if you're really crazy.

173
00:07:45,334 --> 00:07:47,368
Oh, shit.

174
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:49,834
I've still got the gourmet
fuckup in my kitchen.

175
00:07:49,901 --> 00:07:51,700
I'm never gonna
get anything done.

176
00:07:51,767 --> 00:07:54,368
Oh, fuck. I'm fucked.

177
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:58,533
Ooh! You got a nasty mouth
when you're stressed.

178
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,368
You got a pen?
Yeah.

179
00:08:00,433 --> 00:08:02,700
I'm gonna give you
a number,

180
00:08:02,767 --> 00:08:05,034
and you say i said
it was okay for you to call.

181
00:08:05,101 --> 00:08:06,567
Who am i calling?

182
00:08:06,634 --> 00:08:10,400
The candyman.
[Laughs]

183
00:08:10,467 --> 00:08:13,034
Wear sporty shoes.

184
00:08:30,568 --> 00:08:32,401
"Megan89"


185
00:08:37,467 --> 00:08:39,800
"Me too. Sore throat."

186
00:08:39,867 --> 00:08:41,833
Bummer.
[Typing]

187
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,134
What are you wearing?

188
00:08:45,267 --> 00:08:46,700
Take it off.

189
00:08:52,434 --> 00:08:53,867
I tried
to spread the word.

190
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:55,700
I eat here every day,
invited people...

191
00:08:55,767 --> 00:08:57,367
"oh, it's too ethnic."

192
00:08:57,434 --> 00:08:59,167
"Oh, it's too spicy."

193
00:08:59,234 --> 00:09:01,134
"Oh, those people
don't wash their hands."

194
00:09:01,201 --> 00:09:03,034
What the fuck is wrong
with these morons

195
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:07,467
who wait an hour in line at some
fucking crappy olive garden

196
00:09:07,534 --> 00:09:09,733
and let a treasure like this
go out of business?

197
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,301
I can't take it.

198
00:09:11,367 --> 00:09:13,534
Doug,
why are we here?

199
00:09:13,601 --> 00:09:16,234
Did you taste
the saag aloo?

200
00:09:16,301 --> 00:09:18,367
It's to die for
and then be reincarnated

201
00:09:18,434 --> 00:09:19,700
and to die for again.

202
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,000
Why aren't you eating?

203
00:09:21,067 --> 00:09:22,334
I told you i ate already.

204
00:09:22,401 --> 00:09:24,201
Where?
The olive garden.

205
00:09:24,267 --> 00:09:26,467
I wouldn't take a dump
in the olive garden.

206
00:09:26,501 --> 00:09:28,401
I like the hot
artichoke-spinach dip.

207
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:29,900
I can't even look at you.

208
00:09:29,967 --> 00:09:31,134
Okay. Enough.

209
00:09:31,201 --> 00:09:34,467
I'm sure the saag aloo
is delicious.

210
00:09:34,534 --> 00:09:36,767
Wow, that's incredible.

211
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:39,401
Tell me this doesn't
kick your artichoke dip's ass.

212
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,833
Tell me more.

213
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:46,000
Are your nipples hard?

214
00:09:46,067 --> 00:09:47,100
Come on.

215
00:09:47,167 --> 00:09:49,967
"Like shooting stars."

216
00:09:50,034 --> 00:09:51,700
Whew. "now you."

217
00:09:51,767 --> 00:09:53,967
[Typing]
No, more you.

218
00:09:54,034 --> 00:09:56,067
Are you touching yourself?

219
00:09:58,733 --> 00:10:02,301
"I'm parting the lips
of my blushing vagina."

220
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:04,334
[Typing]
Yes. Good.

221
00:10:07,668 --> 00:10:10,334
Ah. Oh.

222
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:14,634
Keep... typing.

223
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,733
Atwh do you think
about this place as the bakery?

224
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,800
I mean, location's pretty good,
kitchen's already set up,

225
00:10:21,867 --> 00:10:23,733
and if you make something
mediocre enough,

226
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,601
you may even make a go
at it legitimately.

227
00:10:25,668 --> 00:10:27,534
Let me think about it.

228
00:10:27,601 --> 00:10:30,100
[Indian accent]
Here you go, mr. Wilson.

229
00:10:30,167 --> 00:10:32,201
20 orders for you.

230
00:10:32,867 --> 00:10:35,300
Let them cool before
you put them in the freezer.

231
00:10:35,367 --> 00:10:38,500
Uh, mr. Advani,
where will you go?

232
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,967
Oh, we just bought an
olive garden franchise close by.

233
00:10:41,101 --> 00:10:43,734
You must come visit.

234
00:10:43,801 --> 00:10:45,134
Fuck agrestic.

235
00:10:45,201 --> 00:10:47,001
Yes, sir. Okay.

236
00:10:47,067 --> 00:10:48,934
Pay when you're ready.

237
00:10:49,001 --> 00:10:51,134
When are my trea
coming in?

238
00:10:51,201 --> 00:10:52,734
I'm having
a little trouble

239
00:10:52,801 --> 00:10:54,734
getting my kitchen
to myself lately.

240
00:10:54,801 --> 00:10:56,234
But i'll let you know.

241
00:11:14,234 --> 00:11:17,034
Hey, lupita.
I was just thinking about you.

242
00:11:17,101 --> 00:11:19,234
It for you.

243
00:11:24,034 --> 00:11:25,700
Wipe your hands.

244
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:32,767
Podrido, asqueroso,
virgen perro.

245
00:11:32,834 --> 00:11:35,201
Yeah, this is andy.

246
00:11:35,268 --> 00:11:37,334
Awesome.

247
00:11:40,211 --> 00:11:42,711
??????

248
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,567
Yeah. I'll bring the shirts.

249
00:11:45,634 --> 00:11:48,434
Uh, let's say 15 minutes.

250
00:11:48,001 --> 00:11:49,001
Okay.

251
00:11:49,067 --> 00:11:51,533
B-oh, uh,
make it 20. okay.

252
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,533
Hey! Get your original

253
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,967
"chris died" t-shirts
right here. Yeah!

254
00:11:57,034 --> 00:11:59,234
Only $10.
Have your money ready.

255
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:00,734
That's one-size-fits-all.

256
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,167
It's gonna shrink
a bit.

257
00:12:02,234 --> 00:12:03,934
Oh, yeah.
Uh-huh.

258
00:12:04,001 --> 00:12:05,167
Okay. That's you.

259
00:12:05,234 --> 00:12:06,533
Uncle andy.

260
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,067
What? What? What?
Hang on.

261
00:12:08,134 --> 00:12:09,567
Uncle andy.

262
00:12:09,634 --> 00:12:11,667
Now, remember kids...
chris loves you, so...

263
00:12:11,734 --> 00:12:13,934
what?! What?!
It's the principal.

264
00:12:15,567 --> 00:12:17,368
Shit. We were
just heating up.

265
00:12:17,433 --> 00:12:19,101
Excuse me.

266
00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:20,934
Um, look, kids.
Chris has risen.

267
00:12:21,001 --> 00:12:23,201
Wha... wal...

268
00:12:32,201 --> 00:12:34,368
Have you all seen these?

269
00:12:34,433 --> 00:12:36,167
They are all
over the schl. Oo

270
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:43,400
And as a christian, i must say
i am deeply, deeply offended.

271
00:12:43,467 --> 00:12:44,834
It's profane.

272
00:12:44,901 --> 00:12:47,034
Has anyone talked
to the principal about this?

273
00:12:47,101 --> 00:12:50,533
Who's chris?
Where's celia? I bet
she'd have something to say.

274
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,667
It's 10 minutes after.
Maybe we should start.

275
00:12:52,734 --> 00:12:54,634
Does anyone know how?

276
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,834
I think the first order of
business should be these shirts.

277
00:12:57,901 --> 00:12:59,167
They're funny.

278
00:12:59,234 --> 00:13:00,967
Excuse me?

279
00:13:01,034 --> 00:13:04,101
I think you're making
way too big a deal about it.

280
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:05,867
It's a joke.

281
00:13:05,934 --> 00:13:09,268
Oh, we do not joke
about r looujesus christ.

282
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:14,433
It's a stupid t-shirt.

283
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,368
Hould ignore it.

284
00:13:16,433 --> 00:13:18,800
Only one man
died for my sins, nancy,

285
00:13:18,867 --> 00:13:20,400
and his name wasn't chris.

286
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:23,001
Well, it sort of was,
wasn't it? Like a nickname?

287
00:13:23,067 --> 00:13:26,368
If we make a big deal, it will
become a full-blown trend.

288
00:13:26,433 --> 00:13:29,101
They're kids.
It'll become cool.

289
00:13:29,167 --> 00:13:32,901
Ah, principal dodge,
have you seen these blasphemes?
Yes.

290
00:13:32,967 --> 00:13:35,700
Are you gonna
do something about them?
I'm about to.

291
00:13:35,767 --> 00:13:38,067
Mrs. Botwin, would you mind
coming into my office

292
00:13:38,134 --> 00:13:40,034
to discuss your son's
t-shirt business?

293
00:13:40,101 --> 00:13:42,101
Shane was selling them?

294
00:13:42,167 --> 00:13:44,800
Yes. With some guy
in a van who sped off.

295
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:47,201
I'll never talk.

296
00:13:48,467 --> 00:13:50,134
Hey. [laughs]

297
00:13:50,201 --> 00:13:52,201
Hey, what do you
like better...

298
00:13:52,268 --> 00:13:55,934
"jesus say relax,"
or "i'm too sexy for my lord"?

299
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,901
How about "asshole ditched
my 10-year-old"?

300
00:13:57,967 --> 00:14:01,301
I admit it. I panicked.
That guy had a whistle.

301
00:14:01,301 --> 00:14:01,334
They wanted
to suspend him.

302
00:14:03,867 --> 00:14:05,167
For what?

303
00:14:05,234 --> 00:14:06,834
If shane wants
to believe in chris

304
00:14:06,901 --> 00:14:08,600
and they try
to suspend him for it...

305
00:14:08,667 --> 00:14:10,268
whoa, that's freedom
of religion.

306
00:14:10,334 --> 00:14:12,001
That's, like,
the first commandment.

307
00:14:12,067 --> 00:14:13,433
We could nail them on that.

308
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,334
I don't think
"chris" is protected

309
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,600
under freedom
of religion, andy.

310
00:14:17,667 --> 00:14:20,934
In fact, the angry christian
moms i heard from in the pta

311
00:14:21,001 --> 00:14:22,834
were pretty offended
by it.

312
00:14:22,901 --> 00:14:25,301
Well,
that's so intolerant.

313
00:14:25,368 --> 00:14:27,800
I mean,
what would jesus do?

314
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:32,433
Religious bullshit aside,
you don't want to know

315
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,368
how far i had to crawl
up the principal's ass

316
00:14:35,433 --> 00:14:37,234
just to keep you two
out of trouble.

317
00:14:37,301 --> 00:14:38,700
Not to mention

318
00:14:38,767 --> 00:14:42,201
the unbelievable amount
of shit i'm gonna get

319
00:14:42,268 --> 00:14:46,167
from those hypo-christian
bitch moms tomorrow.

320
00:14:46,234 --> 00:14:51,433
Hey, i was just trying to
pitch in, earn a little money.

321
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,467
I saw an opportunity to help
the family, and i took it.

322
00:14:54,533 --> 00:14:56,767
Really? It was
for the family, huh?

323
00:14:56,834 --> 00:14:58,867
Where's the money?

324
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,134
Don't worry. I'll use it
towards family expenses.

325
00:15:03,201 --> 00:15:04,334
Hello.

326
00:15:05,834 --> 00:15:07,867
I got to i did call. Thanks
my o for getting back to me.

327
00:15:07,934 --> 00:15:10,001
Can you hold on
a second, please?

328
00:15:10,067 --> 00:15:12,201
Go away.
I have to take this call.

329
00:15:12,268 --> 00:15:13,634
Who is it?

330
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,234
None of your business.
Get out of here.

331
00:15:15,301 --> 00:15:17,368
Why? You got a boyfriend?
Isn't it a little soon?

332
00:15:17,433 --> 00:15:19,533
Maybe i should
take my vibrator back.

333
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,667
Fine, angry!
God, keep the vibrator.

334
00:15:25,067 --> 00:15:29,268
Thanks for getting back
to me, um, candyman.

335
00:15:40,667 --> 00:15:42,034
You're the candyman?

336
00:15:42,101 --> 00:15:44,667
Yes. Are you
getting any exercise?

337
00:15:44,734 --> 00:15:45,901
Excuse me?

338
00:15:45,967 --> 00:15:48,067
If you're not committed
to personal fitness,

339
00:15:48,134 --> 00:15:50,034
i can't in good conscience
sell to you.

340
00:15:50,101 --> 00:15:52,567
I wouldn't say
heylia's in the best shape.

341
00:15:52,634 --> 00:15:54,067
Heylia's a lazy fat-fat,

342
00:15:54,134 --> 00:15:56,400
and i'm hoping to put her
into a diabetic coma,

343
00:15:56,467 --> 00:15:58,433
so i have no problem
selling to her.

344
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,467
Why?
Scare her.

345
00:16:00,533 --> 00:16:03,567
Some people never learn
until their life is on the line.

346
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:10,634
You know what you are?
What am i?

347
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,934
Skinny-fat.

348
00:16:12,001 --> 00:16:14,001
And what are we
gonna do about that?

349
00:16:14,067 --> 00:16:15,934
We're gonna start exercising
right away.

350
00:16:16,001 --> 00:16:18,433
Don't humor me.
I'm very serious.

351
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,533
I used to weigh
314 pounds.

352
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,034
Wow! Congratulations.

353
00:16:24,101 --> 00:16:26,934
The key... exercise.

354
00:16:27,001 --> 00:16:29,634
You know, i'm not buying
for personal use.

355
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,767
Are your customers just a bunch
of fatty mcfat-fats?

356
00:16:32,834 --> 00:16:35,533
Well, they're smokers.

357
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:35,667
But it stands to reason that
if they eat rather than smoke,

358
00:16:39,533 --> 00:16:41,500
they should be able
to breath easier

359
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:43,334
should they decide
to exercise.

360
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,500
That's a reasonable
assumption.

361
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:48,368
And i hope you'll take it
upon yourself to encourage them.

362
00:16:48,433 --> 00:16:51,600
Of course. And i'll take
everything you've got.

363
00:16:51,667 --> 00:16:53,134
Really?

364
00:16:53,201 --> 00:16:54,800
And?

365
00:16:54,834 --> 00:16:57,600
And willi e
a greater effort to exercise

366
00:16:57,667 --> 00:16:59,201
no, no, no, no, no.

367
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,368
And i will exercise.

368
00:17:01,433 --> 00:17:03,700
Yes, you will!

369
00:17:05,167 --> 00:17:06,634
[Laughing]
You dog.

370
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,767
Great. Dumb and dumber
reunited.

371
00:17:09,834 --> 00:17:11,634
Oh, my man.

372
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,234
It's good to see you.
You smell really good.

373
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,400
Get the fuck off me.
What's wrong with you?

374
00:17:16,467 --> 00:17:18,301
Can't a straight man
admire the stink

375
00:17:18,368 --> 00:17:20,067
of another handsome,
straight man?

376
00:17:20,134 --> 00:17:22,334
Not unless you're in prison.
Is that where you been?

377
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,767
Close... alaska.

378
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:26,067
What about you?
What you been up to?

379
00:17:26,134 --> 00:17:27,467
Same old, same old.

380
00:17:27,533 --> 00:17:27,600
Dealing, growing,
doing a little pilates.

381
00:17:29,167 --> 00:17:31,268
No!
I love that shit, man.

382
00:17:31,334 --> 00:17:32,667
It stretch you out.

383
00:17:32,734 --> 00:17:34,700
It give you power,
make you feel good as hell.

384
00:17:34,767 --> 00:17:38,067
Hot instructor.
Ass like a peach.
You just want to bite that shit.

385
00:17:38,134 --> 00:17:39,467
Nice. Nice.

386
00:17:39,533 --> 00:17:43,101
So, uh, conrad, man, can you
hook me up with a little?

387
00:17:50,368 --> 00:17:51,901
[Laughs softly]

388
00:17:51,967 --> 00:17:55,001
That's a lot of weed.

389
00:17:55,067 --> 00:17:58,400
You got the money?

390
00:17:58,467 --> 00:18:01,433
For that much?
I don't, uh...
great.

391
00:18:01,533 --> 00:18:04,600
Lady saltine sends her little
errand boy but no scratch.

392
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:06,134
Nancy?

393
00:18:06,201 --> 00:18:08,634
Yeah, she only paid
for the half order

394
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,034
she picked up
this morning.

395
00:18:11,101 --> 00:18:13,200
And that's
the other half?

396
00:18:13,267 --> 00:18:15,300
You got my money,
boy genius?

397
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,501
??????

398
00:18:29,768 --> 00:18:32,267
Fucking kingpin.

399
00:18:38,434 --> 00:18:39,701
What's so funny?

400
00:18:39,768 --> 00:18:43,967
What? Oh, uh,
conrad does pilates.

401
00:18:45,467 --> 00:18:47,201
Okay, where was i?

402
00:18:47,268 --> 00:18:48,433
I'm surrounded.

403
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,234
You're surrounded
by the enemy.

404
00:18:50,301 --> 00:18:53,268
The enemy edges in
closer, closer.

405
00:18:53,334 --> 00:18:55,533
Then when they're just
inches away,

406
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,600
you invoke
the dong-hi defense.

407
00:18:57,667 --> 00:18:59,700
What's that?

408
00:18:59,767 --> 00:19:01,934
You protect your dong

409
00:19:02,001 --> 00:19:04,533
and you swing
like your life depended on it.

410
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,533
Cool!

411
00:19:07,234 --> 00:19:10,634
I need to talk to you,
you fucking perv.

412
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:14,967
All right.
Go practice that.

413
00:19:15,034 --> 00:19:18,400
What are you talking about?
Did that loony from alaska call?

414
00:19:18,467 --> 00:19:20,467
I'm talking about
what you did to megan today.

415
00:19:20,533 --> 00:19:22,901
Who's megan?
Megan! My girlfriend.

416
00:19:22,967 --> 00:19:25,268
You told her to take her clothes
off when she imed.

417
00:19:25,334 --> 00:19:27,700
Oh! That megan.
Yeah, i did that for you, bro.

418
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,268
You should be
thanking me.

419
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:30,967
What?!
That girl really digs you.

420
00:19:31,034 --> 00:19:33,101
No shit! She's my fucking
girlfriend!

421
00:19:33,167 --> 00:19:35,634
But you haven't gotten
into her panties yet, have you?

422
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,400
It's none
of your business.

423
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:39,034
[Laughs]
You know why?

424
00:19:39,101 --> 00:19:40,500
You're afraid to make moves

425
00:19:40,567 --> 00:19:41,934
'cause she's all
handicapped and shit.

426
00:19:42,001 --> 00:19:43,567
That what
you need to learn.

427
00:19:43,634 --> 00:19:45,600
You got to treat them
like everybody else,

428
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:49,067
and then they pop right open
like a can of pringles.

429
00:19:49,134 --> 00:19:50,700
So...

430
00:19:50,767 --> 00:19:54,634
so... she's ready, man.
You got to go for it.

431
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,167
You gonna
see her tonight?

432
00:19:56,234 --> 00:19:57,467
Yeah.
Well?

433
00:19:57,533 --> 00:19:59,500
Silas, check me out!

434
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,334
You better be right.

435
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,567
Trust me, man.

436
00:20:05,634 --> 00:20:07,700
She's good to go.

437
00:20:14,634 --> 00:20:15,967
Hey, pants.

438
00:20:16,034 --> 00:20:19,467
Please tell me
i didn't hear

439
00:20:19,533 --> 00:20:23,034
that you had cybersex
with a 15-year-old deaf girl.

440
00:20:23,101 --> 00:20:25,600
Absolu not.
I want you out tonight.

441
00:20:25,667 --> 00:20:28,634
Really? 'cause, you know,
i was just cooking dinner.

442
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,433
I want you out now.

443
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,767
I got some
really great recipes

444
00:20:32,834 --> 00:20:36,934
over at my friend conrad's <i>joint</i>
earlier today...

445
00:20:37,001 --> 00:20:39,567
uh, <i>pot</i> roast,
corned-beef <i>hash.</i>

446
00:20:39,634 --> 00:20:43,167
Tonight, i'm gonna galiao it
with a little <i>kedba</i> ziti,

447
00:20:43,234 --> 00:20:45,634
and a big plate of spaghetti
marijuana... uh, i mean...

448
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,533
you sneaky piece of shit.

449
00:20:49,967 --> 00:20:53,767
Oh! Come now,
nancy pants.

450
00:20:53,834 --> 00:20:55,901
Isn't that the <i>pot</i>
calling the kettle black?

451
00:20:55,967 --> 00:20:57,268
What did you do?

452
00:20:57,334 --> 00:20:59,467
Well, i [laughs]
I went to my friend conrad's

453
00:20:59,533 --> 00:21:00,901
to catch up on old times.

454
00:21:00,967 --> 00:21:02,934
You remember conrad?
He's a pot dealer.

455
00:21:03,001 --> 00:21:05,034
He's the one
you're supposed to call

456
00:21:05,101 --> 00:21:07,001
if you ever need
a little puff.

457
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:09,734
And much to my surprise,

458
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:14,467
i was handed
a giant bag of weed

459
00:21:14,533 --> 00:21:17,001
and told it was for you.

460
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,368
Where's my stuff?

461
00:21:18,433 --> 00:21:22,634
So i thought, "wow, either
nancy's got a big problem,

462
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,800
or nancy's got
lot a friends."

463
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:28,400
You've been [laughs]
You've been making friends?

464
00:21:28,467 --> 00:21:30,600
Where's my stuff?!

465
00:21:30,667 --> 00:21:32,901
Don't worry. It's safe.

466
00:21:44,667 --> 00:21:46,201
"Don't worry."

467
00:21:46,268 --> 00:21:49,301
Everything you touch
turns to shit.

468
00:21:51,368 --> 00:21:52,967
I'm family.

469
00:21:53,034 --> 00:21:54,600
We'll work it out.

470
00:21:54,667 --> 00:21:57,567
I really want you
to leave.

471
00:21:57,634 --> 00:21:59,634
Look. The way i see it

472
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:04,533
is you're in way over
your head here, you know?

473
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,800
You got a house,
you got bills, you're a mommy.

474
00:22:07,867 --> 00:22:09,934
Dealing is
a full-time job.

475
00:22:10,001 --> 00:22:12,600
You need some help,
nancy pants.

476
00:22:12,667 --> 00:22:16,400
Don't call me pants.

477
00:22:16,433 --> 00:22:18,667
Judah called me pants,
t yono

478
