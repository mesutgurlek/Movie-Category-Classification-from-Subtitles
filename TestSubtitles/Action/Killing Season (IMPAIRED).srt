Oh, whitetail?

163
00:19:17,056 --> 00:19:21,759
Elk. Elk, they gave you a tag,
lucky dog.

164
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:24,495
What'd you do,
pull some strings with Fish and Wildlife?

165
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:28,833
No patience. You know,
18 months ago I applied for license

166
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,968
for five bull.

167
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,871
Perhaps you come
with me tomorrow.

168
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:35,540
No, really.

169
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:39,243
The storm will be over
and the air will be clear

170
00:19:39,245 --> 00:19:41,312
and maybe, who knows,
you get lucky,

171
00:19:41,314 --> 00:19:43,481
you add another head
to your collection.

172
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:45,716
Well, what are you using?
I use this.

173
00:19:45,718 --> 00:19:46,717
I'll show you.

174
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:55,760
Here.
Jesus Christ, buddy.

175
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:57,361
You fight
in the Indian Wars?

176
00:19:57,363 --> 00:20:00,565
No, this is the same bow
I used as a boy.

177
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:05,002
You know, it's, gets
very clean strong draw.

178
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:10,141
Not jerky like yours.
Well, mine won't snap.

179
00:20:10,143 --> 00:20:13,444
Any bow can snap.
That's fiberglass.

180
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:15,646
I worked with fiberglass
in factory.

181
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:19,383
That was after the war?
No, before the war. Old soldier like you.

182
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,619
But sometimes
it is difficult

183
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:25,022
to know when to leave
the battlefield, you know?

184
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:28,993
You're talking
about the fiberglass.

185
00:20:28,995 --> 00:20:33,164
The tiny beer bubbles
find their way into the malt

186
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:36,000
during
the manufacturing process.

187
00:20:36,002 --> 00:20:39,103
And then each time
you pull the string back,

188
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:42,139
the fiberglass
weakens bit by bit.

189
00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:45,743
One day, you are tracking
your quarry through the grass,

190
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:50,381
and the rocks, and the mud,
and the rain, and the snow,

191
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:52,383
and finally
you see your prize bull

192
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:55,019
right in the sights
and snap!

193
00:20:55,021 --> 00:20:56,520
It breaks.

194
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,058
You're a weird duck.

195
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:02,627
Hmm.

196
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:07,164
What is this photographer?

197
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:10,201
Oh, I did those.
Really?

198
00:21:10,203 --> 00:21:11,402
You're a photographer?

199
00:21:11,404 --> 00:21:13,337
Yeah.

200
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:17,074
What is this one?
Well, that's the old church up in God's Peak.

201
00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:19,944
God's Peak.
Hmm.

202
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:21,212
Reminds me of home.

203
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:25,816
Oh, no, please, I'm fine.
Oh, you got to try it.

204
00:21:25,818 --> 00:21:30,054
I have more than I need,
and it doesn't keep real well.

205
00:21:30,056 --> 00:21:31,756
Or not.
It's a free country.

206
00:21:31,758 --> 00:21:32,590
Okay.

207
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:35,192
If you insist.

208
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:54,545
This is good.
Good, huh? Told you.

209
00:21:54,547 --> 00:21:56,347
It's delicious.

210
00:21:56,349 --> 00:21:59,984
Oh. It almost
slipped my mind.

211
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:01,719
<i>I have something</i>
<i>to return the favor.</i>

212
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:11,529
For the true hunter.

213
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:14,165
It's too late for me now.
Oh, come on.

214
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:17,601
You know,
you did not have aspirin today, okay?

215
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:20,237
So, do not think
of it as a drink.

216
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:24,141
Think of it
as pain killer.

217
00:22:24,143 --> 00:22:27,078
I always drink
with friend.

218
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,412
Never alone.

219
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:31,182
I have many rules,
most I break.

220
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:33,250
But never that one.

221
00:22:33,252 --> 00:22:36,987
So, <i>Zivjeli.</i>
<i>Live long.</i>

222
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:38,356
Zivjeli.

223
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:41,459
<i>[Laughing]</i>

224
00:22:41,461 --> 00:22:43,661
<i>(Emil) I'm telling you,</i>
<i>these women are beautiful.</i>

225
00:22:43,663 --> 00:22:47,064
They fuck all night,
I'm not kidding you.

226
00:22:47,066 --> 00:22:51,168
Okay, now, your turn.
You tell me stories.

227
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,404
War stories. I want to hear this.
War stories?

228
00:22:53,406 --> 00:22:55,740
Yes.
Most of those aren't true.

229
00:22:55,742 --> 00:23:00,010
Most, but some. Ones that are,
why would anyone want to talk about it?

230
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:02,546
How else do you
keep the best life?

231
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:04,515
The past is dead.
Let's keep it that way.

232
00:23:04,517 --> 00:23:08,152
No, see,
now I see the difference between you and me.

233
00:23:08,154 --> 00:23:10,755
You drink
to forget the past,

234
00:23:10,757 --> 00:23:13,023
I drink to remember.

235
00:23:13,025 --> 00:23:16,761
I don't remember much,
but this I do remember.

236
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:22,266
The more booze
you brought over there,

237
00:23:22,268 --> 00:23:24,535
there was plenty of blood.

238
00:23:24,537 --> 00:23:25,770
To the war.

239
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,475
Oh, come on, Benjamin.

240
00:23:31,477 --> 00:23:35,045
Is there not anything
you missed about the war?

241
00:23:35,047 --> 00:23:36,147
Only to not miss it.

242
00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:37,681
But why you say this?

243
00:23:37,683 --> 00:23:39,917
It was nothing but like
cakewalk for you, no?

244
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,687
You don't have any idea what
the war was like for me, buddy.

245
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:50,127
I misspoke.
What I simply meant is that most American soldiers

246
00:23:50,129 --> 00:23:53,230
did nothing more
but lob missiles into Bosnia

247
00:23:53,232 --> 00:23:56,567
from the safety of ships
floating in the Mediterranean.

248
00:23:56,569 --> 00:23:57,601
Most, not all.

249
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:07,378
Three drinks.
Say again?

250
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:10,581
My people say
we love Americans

251
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:13,984
for three drinks,
but we've had five.

252
00:24:13,986 --> 00:24:16,687
And I still love you.
[Laughs]

253
00:24:16,689 --> 00:24:18,155
Hey. Come on.

254

<i>Let's have six.</i>
<i>Maybe seven.</i>

255
00:24:20,827 --> 00:24:23,694
Two more, we'll forget
we even had this conversation.

256
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:31,101
<i> Then Billy Joe reached</i>
<i>for his gun to draw </i>

257
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:36,674
 But the stranger drew his gun
and fired before he even saw 

258
00:24:36,676 --> 00:24:39,577
 As Billy Joe
fell to the floor 

259
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:42,079
 the crowd
all gathered round 

260
00:24:42,081 --> 00:24:46,383
 And wondered
at his final words 

261
00:24:46,385 --> 00:24:50,588
 Don't take your guns
to town, son

 Leave your guns
at home, Bill 

263
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:59,697
 Don't take your guns to town

00:24:59,699 --> 00:25:00,965

00:25:10,476 --> 00:25:12,409
What?
The shooting pain?

268
00:25:12,411 --> 00:25:15,079
Shrapnel,
finding its way out.

269
00:25:15,081 --> 00:25:17,882
Why don't you
just get this removed?

270
00:25:17,884 --> 00:25:20,918
Well, doctor says my choice.

271
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,287
I hate hospitals anyway.

272
00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:24,822
Maybe you like pain.

273
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:29,960
Sometimes things
become part of you.

274
00:25:29,962 --> 00:25:31,729
Whether you like it or not.

275
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:41,639
What is this?
Is this a picture of baby?

My grandson gets
baptized tomorrow morning.

I'm going to make it.

I haven't even met the kid yet.

279

Yeah, but, you know,
he sent this invitation,

I'm sure
he wants you to go.

but she's been married,
what, going on 20 years now.

284
00:26:04,931 --> 00:26:08,866

Kicker? What's "kicker?"

Surprise.
<i>Surprise, yes.</i>

He's been there for my son.

You test my German. Okay.

296
00:26:44,804 --> 00:26:48,272
It is the hunter's honor
that he protects

297
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:52,309
and preserves his game,
hunts sportsmanlike,

298
00:26:52,311 --> 00:26:57,281
and honors the creator
and his creatures.

[Laughs]

300

Benjamin, did you honor
the creator in him?

301
00:27:05,391 --> 00:27:07,691
I didn't kill him.
You didn't?

302

I haven't killed anything in 20 years.
You're joking.

303
00:27:10,596 --> 00:27:15,366
No. Everything you see here inside, outside,
all bullshit. Bullshit, what do you mean--

304
00:27:15,368 --> 00:27:16,867
Everything here,
bullshit car,

305
00:27:16,869 --> 00:27:19,503
bullshit house,
bullshit fiberglass bow,

306
00:27:19,505 --> 00:27:23,674
bullshit heads on a wall, it's all bullshit.
Come on, I would love to have this.

307

Want to hear
something pathetic?

308
00:27:25,645 --> 00:27:28,312
This was all here when I bought this place.
You're joking.

309
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:32,516
No. Furnished with rustic interior design elements.
Oh, my God.

310
00:27:32,518 --> 00:27:37,087
That's what the listing said. That's it.
It's all bullshit. That is not the man you are.

311
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:39,990
I mean I grew up in a place like this,
but not as big

312
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:42,993
and actually not as fancy,
but it was, you know,

313
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:47,264
it was the real deal, mountains, trees,
hung out with my dad.

314
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:50,868
Hey, I'll show you something.
You'll get a kick out of this.

315
00:27:57,275 --> 00:27:58,776
That was my dad's.
What is this?

316
00:27:58,778 --> 00:28:01,912
Silver star
for gallantry in action.

00:28:01,914 --> 00:28:05,115
But does he have some war stories to tell, huh?
Oh, yeah.

318
00:28:05,117 --> 00:28:08,252
I fought three different wars,
four different countries,

319
00:28:08,254 --> 00:28:10,320
still couldn't get
one of these.

320
00:28:10,322 --> 00:28:11,789
Really?

321
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:16,060
No prize for Ben.
That's not good.

322
00:28:16,062 --> 00:28:19,396
All the good things you did,
you know, why not--

323
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:22,266
I remember the first time
we went hunting,

324
00:28:22,268 --> 00:28:24,201
I told him
I wanted to use his bow.

325
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:28,172
He said,
"You're not strong enough to draw the string back."

326
00:28:28,174 --> 00:28:30,808
He taught you
how to use this bow.

327
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:32,776
Yeah, he taught me how to make a bow.
Oh, make a bow.

328
00:28:32,778 --> 00:28:36,080
He could do anything with his hands.
Oh, yeah, he was... Whoa.

329
00:28:36,082 --> 00:28:37,581
He could do it all.

330
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:39,183
I hit something
the first time out,

331
00:28:39,185 --> 00:28:41,852
medium sized bow,
right in the heart.

332
00:28:41,854 --> 00:28:43,654
"Eagle eye," that's
what my dad called me.

333
00:28:43,656 --> 00:28:46,890
Ah, Eagle eye.
Yeah. [Chuckles]

334
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,663
Okay, you know...

335
00:28:52,665 --> 00:28:57,201
It's time for me to be roughing it again.
Are you sure?

336
00:28:57,203 --> 00:29:04,608
I've got a spare room in the back-- No, you have
been very kind, you've been very generous.

337
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:08,879
My offer still stands,
tomorrow at dawn,

338
00:29:08,881 --> 00:29:12,382
the west fork,
and I'll tell you what.

339
00:29:12,384 --> 00:29:15,619
I even give you the first shot.
I appreciate it.

340
00:29:15,621 --> 00:29:19,323
I got lots of things to do tomorrow.
Nice to have you over.

341
00:29:19,325 --> 00:29:21,058
You get good sleep.
You think about it.

342
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,493
Maybe you change
your mind.

343
00:29:22,495 --> 00:29:24,328
My thanks to you.
Thank you.

344
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:27,264
Okay. Goodnight, Benjamin.
You too, you too.

345
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:31,401
Have a good sleep.
You too, Emil.

346
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:55,959
(Ben)
Careful, it's slippery.

347
00:29:57,595 --> 00:29:59,229
(Emil)
So, how do you feel?

348
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:01,098
(Ben) Got a hangover,
bouncing back.

349
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,466
(Emil)
Not so much for me.

350
00:30:02,468 --> 00:30:05,302
(Ben) You're used to it,
I'm sure.

351
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:08,472
(Emil) Mountainman, Davy Crockett.
(Ben) You know that?

352
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:10,107
(Emil) I do.
(Ben) You heard over there?

353
00:30:10,109 --> 00:30:13,510
(Emil) As a boy.
You are Davy Crockett.

354
00:30:13,512 --> 00:30:17,714
I never go this way.
(Ben) Mountainmen.

355
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:23,520
You go up
in the meadow over there.

356
00:30:23,522 --> 00:30:25,389
I've had good luck there.

357
00:30:25,391 --> 00:30:28,826
I'm going up to the deer stand.
Take this.

358
00:30:28,828 --> 00:30:32,896
It's voice activated. Channel three.
Put it on channel three.

359
00:30:32,898 --> 00:30:35,933

One, two. One, two.

360
00:30:35,935 --> 00:30:37,634
It's good stuff.

Testing. Testing.

362
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:47,444
Did you ever hear the one
about this old Italian guy

363
00:30:47,446 --> 00:30:50,147
wants to confess
to local padre?

364
00:30:50,149 --> 00:30:52,482
So he slides open the little door in the confessional.

365
00:30:52,484 --> 00:30:55,419
He says, "Father,
forgive me for I have sinned.

366
00:30:55,421 --> 00:30:57,788
"Back during the war,
there was this beautiful woman.

367
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:01,391
"She came to my house and asked
me to protect her from the Nazis.

368
00:31:01,393 --> 00:31:03,727
"So I hid her up my attic."

369
00:31:03,729 --> 00:31:06,697
The priest says,
"That's a wonderful thing you did, my son.

370
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:08,966
"There's no need to confess."

371
00:31:08,968 --> 00:31:11,301
And the old man says,
"But it gets worse.

372
00:31:11,303 --> 00:31:16,273
"She started to repay me with
sexual favors like blowjobs."

373
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:19,109
[Static]

374
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:26,583
So the priest says, "Fear not,
my son, war makes sinners of us all.

375
00:31:26,585 --> 00:31:28,752
"You are forgiven."
The old man says,

376
00:31:28,754 --> 00:31:33,957
"Well, that's a great burden
off my mind. A great burden.

377
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:38,095
"But I have one more question."
<i>(Emil) Do you see him?</i>

378
00:31:38,097 --> 00:31:40,597
<i>Do you have a shot?</i>

379
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:46,203
Yeah, I'll try.

380

I am the priest.

00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:38,575
And this is our confession.

453
00:39:38,577 --> 00:39:40,810
So, what are your sins, my son?

454
00:39:40,812 --> 00:39:45,548
And you say something like, "Oh,
bless me, father, for I have sinned.

455
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:49,753
"It's been so and so many days since my
last confession, and these are my sins."

456
00:39:49,755 --> 00:39:53,056
Now, you know what that means to confess, no?
Of course you do.

457
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:56,926
But, you, you say things like,
"Oh, my wife left me.

"Oh, my son calls
different man 'father.'

"Oh, I miss my dear old daddy."

And I'll tell you why.

487
00:44:43,313 --> 00:44:47,517
It was walking home
from the factory in Lukomir.

488
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:51,554
<i>And I see a crowd of people</i>
<i>in town square.</i>

<i>Serbs from their houses.</i>

<i>my mother, my sister,</i>

<i>they were not so lucky.</i>

493
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:12,709
<i>They used the axes to split their heads</i>
<i>open and let them die in square.</i>

494
00:45:12,711 --> 00:45:15,712

<i>such terrible things?</i>

496
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:20,683
Then I think all the things
that happened in my life

497
00:45:20,685 --> 00:45:24,187
and I realized that is not
the proof of the absence of God,

498
00:45:24,189 --> 00:45:26,589
this is the proof
of his existence.

499

Because men alone could not be
capable of such magnificent evil.

Can't move, eh?

630
00:58:07,952 --> 00:58:10,419
I know this feeling.

631
00:58:10,421 --> 00:58:12,621
For three years...

632
00:58:12,623 --> 00:58:16,325
I had very much
the same feeling.

633
00:58:16,327 --> 00:58:21,630
I was shot in the back and I was
paralyzed from the neck down.

634
00:58:21,632 --> 00:58:23,765
And I could barely talk.

635
00:58:23,767 --> 00:58:26,301
And you know
how much I like to talk.

636
00:58:29,205 --> 00:58:34,810
And there was beautiful nurse.
Her name was Sophia.

She was always
dressed in white.

She always had beautiful smile on her face.

639
00:58:45,589 --> 00:58:48,724

You know
what her job was?

00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:58,100

the piss and the shit

But slowly
the feeling came back.

645
00:59:05,809 --> 00:59:08,677
You know,
I taught myself how to write.

646
00:59:08,679 --> 00:59:10,679
I taught myself
how to eat.

647
00:59:10,681 --> 00:59:13,916
I taught myself
to speak again

648
00:59:13,918 --> 00:59:19,054
and to walk like a man,
not like cripple.

649
00:59:19,056 --> 00:59:21,890
I had no help. I had no mother.
I had no father.

650
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:26,895
I had no wife or child.

651
00:59:26,897 --> 00:59:29,064
And you know
what kept me going?

652

who would win.

My country has beauty,

A young cowboy, Billy Joe,
grew restless on the farm.

The boy filled with wanderlust,
he really meant no harm.
