- Would you guys give us a second?
- Daddy.

307
00:19:11,099 --> 00:19:12,498
- Jimmy.
JIMMY: We just wanna talk.

308
00:19:12,668 --> 00:19:15,296
- We hardly ever get to talk.
- It's okay.

309
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:17,131
- Go get a drink at the bar.
- Be nice.

310
00:19:17,306 --> 00:19:20,332
Get your mom a drink.
Look at her, stressed out.

311
00:19:20,509 --> 00:19:22,306
- What are you drinking?
- Scotch.

312
00:19:22,477 --> 00:19:23,535
Rum? Nice.

313
00:19:23,712 --> 00:19:26,772
- Rum on the rocks for your stepfather.
- It's fine.

314
00:19:26,949 --> 00:19:29,349
- And I'm just gonna have some water.
- Okay, Daddy.

315
00:19:29,518 --> 00:19:31,918
- You look beautiful. You really do.
- Thank you.

They give me a gun with bullets.

320
00:19:53,008 --> 00:19:56,444
I gotta go out every day,
chase bad guys, try and catch them.

321
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,079
All kinds of bad guys:

322
00:19:58,247 --> 00:20:01,683
Rapists, drug dealers, burglars.

323
00:20:02,985 --> 00:20:05,647
But you know what the worst kind
of bad guy is in my book?

324
00:20:07,189 --> 00:20:10,590
It's somebody that would try to
humiliate a father...

325
00:20:11,026 --> 00:20:13,392
...in front of his own daughter.

326
00:20:13,896 --> 00:20:15,727
His little girl.

327
00:20:22,037 --> 00:20:25,302
- That it?
- Yeah, that's it.

328
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,538
- It was good.
- Thanks.

329
00:20:29,244 --> 00:20:31,576
Listen, Jimmy.
Ava's like a daughter to me.

330
00:20:31,747 --> 00:20:33,715
She's not your daughter.
She's my daughter.

331
00:20:34,182 --> 00:20:36,844
Well, that's why I said "like a daughter."

332
00:20:37,386 --> 00:20:39,013
And it's my job...

333
00:20:39,187 --> 00:20:43,055
...to make sure she and Pam
get anything they want.

334
00:20:43,225 --> 00:20:44,453
I'm the second husband.

335
00:20:44,626 --> 00:20:45,854
[LAUGHS]

336
00:20:46,028 --> 00:20:49,122
And $50,000 for Ava's happiness...

337
00:20:49,298 --> 00:20:51,698
...that's nothing to me.

338
00:20:51,867 --> 00:20:53,767
You know, that's a weekend in Vegas.

339
00:20:55,103 --> 00:21:00,166
Now, if you can't afford
to pay for your daughter's wedding...

340
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,139
...I will.

341
00:21:02,477 --> 00:21:06,345
Because a deadbeat ex-husband...

342
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,177
...who never had to pay any alimony...

343
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,649
...you're welcome, by the way...

344
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:15,449
...and can't pay
for his only daughter's wedding?

345
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:21,255
Ooh. To me? That's a bad guy.

346
00:21:24,066 --> 00:21:26,261
So why don't you go ahead...

347
00:21:26,435 --> 00:21:30,599
...and keep your little promise
to the great city of New York.

348
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,134
Take that gun of yours...

349
00:21:34,309 --> 00:21:37,437
...and shoot yourself, Serpico.

350
00:21:37,946 --> 00:21:41,279
- Daddy? Can I talk to you?
- Of course. Of course.

Excuse me, Roy.

Prick.

353
00:21:47,522 --> 00:21:50,457
I don't have to have the big wedding
if it's too much.

354
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:53,025
We can just have something small
with a few friends.

355

Oh, baby, come here.
Are you kidding me?

You are gonna have the wedding
that you always wanted.

Big, all your friends, everybody.

358

Even your mom's gonna be happy.

Stop worrying, all right?

360

- Really?
- Really.

- Are you sure?
- Yes.

Because I really want a big wedding.

You're gonna get a big wedding.
What'd I tell you?

- Is he looking at me right now?
- Mm-hm.

You got me, Paul.

because I finally closed the ramen account.

I forgot.

and you just forgot?

Don't change the subject.

by yourself?

Our celebration? You weren't even here.

- But, baby, you my tenderoni.

- I know that I'm lucky to have you.

I love you and I married you because
you're funny, and you're smart.

of Henry or anybody else, okay?

like a research monkey?

406
00:26:02,911 --> 00:26:06,142
- I'm lying. What's a Pafko?
- It's a baseball card.

407
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:08,339
Baseball card?

- Asshole, I don't need 20 bucks.

I'm selling it
to cover my daughter's wedding.

came out with the first baseball cards...

the first card in that set.

<i>Then they'd stack them up,
wrap rubber bands around them.</i>

<i>My pop...</i>

417
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:42,578
...never wrapped rubber bands
around his cards.

<i>Loved Andy Pafko.</i>

of these at auction for about $83,000.

He maketh me lie down
