No, that is as a villain. That may
eat nails with a corkscrew.

Gilbrough is the main authority
at Poldark. What is he up to?

00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,600
If his mission to sabotage
the world's oil reserves...

66
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,800
Why he served for
as a small refiner?

67
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,600
I make sure that you can ask him.

68
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,000
How do you get about?
With a jetpack?

69

That was fun.
- Great aerobics.

80
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:27,200
We must do this again.
- Poldark, we go.

81
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,400
You had Poldark his face.

Good job, Bob. Unbelievable.

Maybe I can make
government that you lend your little longer.

86
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,900
No, this was my last assignment.

87
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,400
I retire.
- Still not Gillian?

88
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,200
I want to live. Wedding.

89
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:04,800
Not married. Take a woman you
over five years hate and give her your house.

90
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:10,200
Keep watch it.
To compliment the CIA.

91
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,300
Gillian, who is that woman
cover your next home lives?

92
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,100
Yes, they are already as this.
- I never give this life for a woman.

93
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,800
We are spies.
Every boy wants a spy.

94
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:23,300
It is life. All the hours
you spend in such a small room like this.

95
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,300
Cold food in a surveillance van.
It is all the time on your shot.

96
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,000
Learning to pee in a bottle
in a moving car.

97
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:34,600
You do it right.
- Any problem, her children hate me.

98
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,900
You rule.
- We miss you, success with the children.

99
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,900
I've shot down dictators,
how difficult three children?

100
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:49,200
Come on, Ringo. Get down.

101
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,400
Hi, kids.

102
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,800
Sorry about last night.

103
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:05,200
Never mind, that's your job.
- No, it was rude.

104
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,200
It never happens again, promised.

105
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,200
Mum, what with Ringo?

106
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,200
He'll come down
when he finished.

107
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,300
Want to see I'm working?
- Of course.

108
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,300
Come on, kitty.
It is not as high.

109
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,900
Please?

110
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,200
Please.

111
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,800
What do you think?

112
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,600
It remains to be finished.
But today I could not do anything...

113
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:06,000
the cat on the roof, satellite breaks down again.
I phoned two hours for a repairman.

114
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,100
And I always think of yesterday.

115
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,700
So...

116
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,100
so good between us?

117
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,800
I understand it, as a man with your
marries, he marries you all four.

118
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:23,200
Forget the pig,
the cat and the turtle does not.

119
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,300
Do you really nicely?
- Frightening.

120
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:34,200
You are truly the last honest
man in the world, I sometimes think.

121
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,700
I have cookies.

122
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,900
Yes?
- Are you really married to Bob?

123
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,500
What? Calm down.
- You cannot do, Gillian.

124
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,900
You're so much above him.
- He is boring and a nerd.

125
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,800
He is a very sweet man
who treats me very well.

126
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
He is a pen importer.
- He is a cyborg.

127
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,300
You know him like me.
He is very enthusiastic about the world...

128
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,900
and my art. He likes to talk
history, science...

129
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,200
and politics.
- So it is boring.

130
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,100
You call it boring,
I call it reliable.

131
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,600
I also want a man who
every day to work.

132
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:33,100
And who comes home every night.
Not lying or deceiving...

133
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,400
or who leaves his family and...

134
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,900
My luck also counts.

135
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,000
Old people as hateful feelings.

136
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,200
We need to see Bob working away.

137
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,400
What is the story here?
- Poldark was transported.

138
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:19,000
He's not escaped?
- He is so taken as can be.

139
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,400
This was one planned.
She knew that he came.

140
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,600
Say you have a mole is?
- No, only that he escaped.

141
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,900
Welcome back.

142
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,800
Get Chad.

143
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,200
You cannot imagine what it is...

144
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:08,300
the oppressive darkness and
agonizing torture and endless torment.

145
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,700
The prison is a hell.
- You were there four hours.

146
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,300
More than enough.

147
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:20,100
I need a new path
of the formula. As soon as possible.

148
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,100
In two days we test again.

149
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,300
I have to get dressed.
Something contemporary and fashionable.

150
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:33,000
And something to eat
that is not a toy.

151
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,300
Yes.

152
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,500
Honey, we make the finished pumpkins.
Are you?

153
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,400
Absolutely, because I'm a loser
and have no life.

154
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,700
Did I mention that we
to roast the pumpkin seeds?

155
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,300
Come on, Join us.

156
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,700
And what I want private.
- Do not be with me.

157
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,500
I do when I want.
- Farren.

158
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,300
I want you down...
- I do not. Way.

159
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,900
This is my house...
- You hold me!

160
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I said outside, Gillian.

161
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:04,600
Downstairs, in five minutes.
- I hate this house and family. Way!

162
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,000
No, she hears me.
I sit on the roof.

163
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,800
The only place where I is private.

164
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,900
I cannot Gillian
that guy to marry.

165
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
No, he is indeed a hen,
but that is not the problem.

166
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,500
What if my dad comes back?

167
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,700
He lets me not only here,
he comes back.

168
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,700
And what if they married?

169
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,600
No idea.

170
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,200
Mum, Ian Devan gives bacon.

171
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,200
That is wrong.
- Why?

172
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,700
Bob Ho.
- Hi.

173
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,200
And how are the kids?
- I go picnicking with them.

174
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,800
I force them to like me.
- Hen force?

175
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:23,200
You may as well scratch your ear
with your elbow.

176
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,800
Guess. Poldark escaped.

177
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,000
Not my problem.
- I know.

178
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,900
But we have discovered a document.
An international portal to a website.

179
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,500
We have not cracked.
Maybe you see it.

180
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,600
Failing that, great.
If not, nothing wrong.

181
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,800
For you. Send it to my computer at home.

182
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:52,300
Already happened. Now I think of...

183
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,500
they think there is a mole in the agency.

184
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,800
They suspect me?
- No...

185
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,300
you're the sharpest hook on the wire.

186
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,500
No idea what you say.

187
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,600
Enjoy your picnic.
Call me when you look at that file.

188
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,300
Thank you.

189
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:31,000
I saw codes. Let's see.

190
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:47,300
Is it noon already?
- No, bad news.

191
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,800
My father lies in a hospital.
- That is terrible.

192
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,200
He played softball and slipped.
Now, his hip replaced.

193
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:01,500
Terrible. - I have children
leave to care for father.

194
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,800
Great.
- What?

195
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,600
Let me look at them.
We learn to know each other.

196
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:13,200
No, you and them?

197
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,900
I do not know.

198
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,900
My aunt flies over San Antonio.
She is very good with children.

199
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,800
She was in the army.
- This is perhaps what we need.

200
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,300
Can you really that busy?

201
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,400
Driving, homework, Halloween.
Their costume complete.

202
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,200
Decorate the house.
- No problem.

203
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:36,800
Halloween is my favourite.
They are perfectly safe with me.

204
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:40,200
About them, I am not worried.

205
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,500
That you kidding?
- Are there any other options?

206
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,400
Foster care, juvenile detention?

207
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,000
I love you.

208
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,200
I miss you.
- Yeah, so let us support you.

209
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:00,700
You survive it.
I buy something.

210
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,300
Bye! We love you.

211
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,500
Is not this great?

212
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,100
I get some things in
and we go to your home.

213
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,500
His computer. Let's see.
- Good idea.

214
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,000
There should be standing up dirt.

215
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,000
Fashion, Armageddon.

216
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,200
I do not remember.
I still see the file.

217
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,500
But this is important...

218
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,800
What is Halloween?

219
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,800
Do you realize what this is?

220
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:51,600
You excited? Fixed a
dictionary.

221
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,400
You confuse me with a very
different class of nerd.

222
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,900
Stockholm GBH.
Davis Bodily Harm.

223
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,600
Live in Stockholm. One of the
rarest concerts.

224
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,100
Why did Bob die?
- What does it matter?

225
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,600
I get it off.

226
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:11,900
This is my ticket to coolness.

227
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,600
This should I wear?

228
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,300
You wanted something contemporary.
- Just the First Prince of Belarus.

229
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,600
Let someone get elegant.

230
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,000
What is the problem?

231
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:38,300
I wanted to pick up the formula
and noticed that someone else had access.

232
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,400
If China has the formula,
they can develop the antimatter.

233
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,900
I urge the Ip address.
But it is really encrypted.

234
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,800
It takes a while.

235
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:51,100
Find out who my formula
picked and get it back.

236
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,100
And...?
- Kill them.

237
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,600
Thank you.

238
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,800
What is wrong with you?
- I kill you.

239
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,100
What? I you.

240
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,400
Do not hurt me!
She makes me hurt.

241
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:17,100
Stop, what's going on?

242
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,500
She threw a stink bomb in my room.
- Really not true.

243
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,900
So I threw in my own room?

244
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,700
To give you problems?
Pathetic.

245
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,600
So sad.

246
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,700
Farren, I am very disappointed.

247
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,900
You should be resting.

248
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
If we have homework on time,
we may stay up to twelve hours.

249
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,400
She also wants us adult films.
A tradition.

250
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:49,400
Here I have not thought about.

251
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:01,500
Nora, time for bed.

252
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,200
I would not go to sleep!

253
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:11,400
You can never catch.

254
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,200
Coming!

255
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:21,200
Come back.

256
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,800
Come back.

257
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,600
I got you. Come back.

258
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,500
Come on.

259
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,700
Mum is just my clothes!

260
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:47,400
Mum always dresses me.

261
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,800
Is that your mom do that?

262
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,900
Now sleep.

263
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,200
Get Out!

264
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,400
Hello?
- You're alive.

265
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,400
That 's a good sign.
How are the kids?

266
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,500
A great night.
So simple.

267
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,900
Really? You and my kids, right?

268
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:44,400
Bob, last thing you wanted
about your job...

269
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:48,300
but I interrupted you.
Would you tell me?

270
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,300
That can wait until you get back.

271
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:56,000
This was really a good idea, I think.

272
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:59,500
The worst is definitely behind us.

273
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,700
Please wait.

274
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,900
I al

275
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,200
Fire!

276
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,000
Mistake.

277
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:00,100
Everything is good.
Almost done.

278
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,500
I sit in front.
- It is not your day.

279
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,800
Can you really go to school
Your mother?

280
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,000
Of course, Bob.

281
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,700
"Sure, Bob.

282
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:28,100
Bye.
- Have a nice day.

283
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:41,700
What do you do every day?
- Nothing, I'm lazy.

284
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,800
You're lying.
- Yeah, you're lying.

285
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,200
I picked up yesterday.

286
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:55,800
Really? Would have been pretty cool.
- Yeah, pretty cool.

287
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,200
Let's hear it then.

288
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,800
That's just a lot of noise.

289
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:08,400
I do not get it.
- I do. You're pathetic and a liar.

290
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,400
We get him.

291
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,900
Put me down!

292
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,800
Put me down.
- Okay, you asked for it.

293
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,000
You have heard of me,
through a lawyer.

294
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:27,600
Here do I pay for you all.

295
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:38,400
Tell me more about Halloween.

296
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:43,700
That's great. You get sweets,
you're dressed as someone else.

297
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,100
And nobody knows who you are.

298
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,200
That sounds familiar.

299
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,300
What would you be? Frankenstein?

300
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:58,800
A Zombie?
- Honey, would you a princess?

301
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,800
Well, princess.

302
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:20,300
No fee. A princess.

303
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,800
Princess.

304
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:31,200
Pink.
- Pink.

305
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:52,500
Princess.
- It is too big.

306
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,300
Too big?

307
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,500
Sorry.

308
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:13,800
You do not walk away.
- I'm sorry.

309
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:17,200
Let your costume going to pay.

310
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:24,200
With Ho.

311
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,900
Hold him until I get there.

312
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:37,500
May I say before we begin
only the current condition of the...

313
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:41,100
American Public School System
I filed is...

314
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:46,800
head first, into a bin and I get
then a penalty.

315
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,200
Who are you exactly?

316
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:54,800
I am his mother...

317
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,300
neighbour.
- Buurman.

318
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,100
I watch him a few days.

319
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,300
This is not the first time Ian
in trouble.

320
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:04,100
He lost in battle. He is lying.
- I'm not lying.

321
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:08,700
You've told everyone you Celina Gomez
have been invited to the spring dance.

322
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,900
Her coming to the USA was a problem.

323
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,300
You said that your New Year's Eve
have spent at the Playboy Mansion?

324
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,100
"Pay per view. It felt like I was there.

325
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,400
I tell you, lying is a dangerous game.

326
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,000
You sell pens. What...
Oh, no.

327
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,700
They are.
- Who?

328
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,800
These criminals have future
I put in the trash.

329
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:37,600
We have received punishment by you.
- Yes, by you.

330
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:41,100
There you go for pay.
- Gentlemen, we want no trouble.

331
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,400
Who is that. Your mother?
- My bodyguard.

332
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,700
I hired him.
Better watch out.

333
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,300
Is that true?
- No, he makes a joke.

334
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,400
I'm the babysitter.
- What are you doing?

335
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:56,900
You ask politely if we can through.

336
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,400
You are humiliating.
Why did not you?

337
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:15,000
Why did you I was your bodyguard?

338
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:19,100
I think it was too much stress.

339
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:35,800
How are you? I'm Ian.
You have a beautiful body.

340
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:39,200
Can I hold it against me?

341
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,800
At least you're not shy.

342
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:45,000
I wanted in the worst way
talk to her.

343
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:48,200
Mission accomplished.

344
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:55,500
Come here.
You look so beautiful.

345
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:02,200
I did not know you did gymnastics.
- Why?

346
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,100
You know nothing about me.

347
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,800
You go and you talk Gillian
Never us.

348
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,800
Come on.

349
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,200
The woman has a point.

350
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,800
I do not know who you are to send out
my clothes.

351
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,500
I want them killed.

352
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:30,200
You could even go.
- I'm the most wanted man in America.

353
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:34,700
I cannot stretch the
JCPenney to sniff.

354
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,800
Give me something that I can mix.
Something extremely American.

355
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:42,300
We are ready to test.

356
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,600
Beautiful.

357
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,500
She certainly has its plastic shoes.
It eats any petroleum product.

358
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,700
We are working on.

359
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,700
What happened to the bacteria?
- They live as long as they are fed.

360
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:41,500
If that path, then disappear.
- Just like my Jimmy Choo's.

361
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,700
Come inside.

362
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:59,000
About today...
- You had me to come.

363
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,900
I have to face come.
- Do it.

364
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,900
Unless you the rest of your life with your head
in the trash will spend.

365
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,200
Thanks for the advice.
All my problems are solved.

366
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,400
Do you get it in the lower?
- No, I read for pleasure.

367
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,000
You're smart.

368
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,900
It you're not so bad.
Why ruin everything?

369
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,100
Girls are not really impressed
of astro physical.

370
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:38,200
According to the sources I can design a rocket
build and launch a...

371
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:41,400
really in orbit around the moon would go.

372
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:45,500
But that cannot other guys.

373
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,200
They throw balls through a ring.

374
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,600
I do not want you any problems.

375
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,600
If you now try the truth
to tell...

376
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:58,000
tell your mom anything
about your date.

377
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:01,100
Really. That was almost cool.

378
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,900
For a guy who sells pens?

379
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,400
Come on, kids.
Bedtime.

380
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:16,400
Come on. Even a spoon.

381
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:02,700
Just one. That I learned in China
when I was young.

382
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:50,000
I agree.
I need your help.

383
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:04,000
I have a lot of fuss to make
to get all this stuff.

384
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:07,000
What did you say them?
- If I do not know what weapons...

385
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:10,200
Don, I get problems.

386
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:13,400
Where did you get this all for?
- In order to get kids ready for school.

387
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:18,300
As my mother always said,
when they were in East Berlin Sat...

388
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,400
spying is easy, parents are
is difficult. Good luck.

389
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,400
But come on.

390
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:43,400
You're there all morning.
Let me in there.

391
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:48,800
Farren, let me in there.

392
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,700
You're there all morning.
Let me in there.

393
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,600
Now it's my turn.

394
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,400
Farren, Daughter
a longer skirt.

395
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,900
This means war.

396
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,300
Stay with Bob.

397
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,600
Where is he?
- He is hiding.

398
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,100
He lets us fall into the trap,
so we open the door.

399
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,300
I will store?

400
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:51,100
You know the rules.
No soft drinks upstairs.

401
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,500
I just wanted a drink.

402
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,800
Breakfast is served.

403
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:23,700
Nora, bedtime.

404
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:36,600
Good night.

405
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,100
Cannot sleep?
- How did you find me?

406
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:46,600
Call it a gamble.

407
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:01,600
Why you say 'Gillian' to your mother
instead of Mom?

408
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,700
She is my mother.
- What do you mean?

409
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:10,600
My father has been married before.
And my mother died when I was little.

410
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:15,100
Gillian is my stepmother, and Ian and Nora
My half-brother and sister.

411
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:18,700
I'm the freak of the family.

412
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,000
He must have hurt you
when he left.

413
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:23,100
He'll come back to me.

414
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,000
I know he is not the world best dad
but he loves me.

415
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:29,600
And he let me not alone.

416
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:38,000
You should not climb on the roof,
that is not safe.

417
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:40,300
Please do not say that I
should not be.

418
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,700
Here I can chill.

419
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:46,300
I wanted to make a railing.

420
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:49,800
Are you bribe me so
I like you?

421
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:53,100
I just want you safe.

422
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:03,000
Can I chill with you?
- It's a free country.

423
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,600
Look at that star?

424
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:31,100
Good news. We have an address.

425
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:38,400
Well, take what men and
get that file back.

426
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:45,700
No survivors.

427
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,600
Boss, you find that?

428
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,500
Not nice?

429
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,300
May I propose a few fashion?

430
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:08,300
Women do not like
the shirt is tucked there.

431
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,900
Do you see her through the war.

432
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,600
Do you know anything about fashion?
- No, but I know the women.

433
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:19,700
Wear it so. That's cool.
I have seen in the film.

434
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:23,600
What movie? Octopus?
It is not 1985.

435
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:27,000
That I almost forgot.
- What is that?

436
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:29,800
Iggy Pop and David Bowie in Shanghai.

437
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:34,000
That is the greatest concert
of the world.

438
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:37,600
I guarantee that no school
in this district has.

439
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:41,200
Have you downloaded this for me?
- No worries, I've paid for.

440
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:44,900
How do you know this?
- Simple. I was there.

441
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:56,600
Bob, you are too efficient.
We are half hour early.

442
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:59,100
You are welcome.

443
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:03,400
Happy days.

444
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,600
Another cool?
- Thanks again.

445
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:12,700
Whatever.

446
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:38,400
Happy days.

447
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:42,600
That conversation on the roof, does
not that we're friends.

448
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:45,100
God forbid.

449
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:07,500
There is none.

450
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:12,000
I've cracked the computer, but the file
is downloaded to an external device.

451
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:15,100
I cannot find STATS.

452
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,500
I think I have just discovered
who live here.

453
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:22,500
Agent Ho.

454
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:37,200
Stop shooting at things.

455
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:39,800
I said it really was like the CIA
whether the Chinese had.

456
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:44,800
But he is both. Find him.
But keep him alive.

457
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:49,000
I need to know to whom he
This effort has shown.

458
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:57,500
Listen. Here.

459
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:03,000
We must find CIA agent.

460
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:06,300
He is very cunning. The best.

461
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:10,300
It is not easy to find.
Not now.

462
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:13,800
Imagine that you're Chinese.
Well trained.

463
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:17,900
And you want to disappear.
- I see him climbing on the roof with stuff.

464
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:21,800
He is not Conan the Barbarian.
Good try.

465
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:24,800
I see him. There.

466
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,500
Hurry.

467
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:34,100
Get him down.

468
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,900
Kill him not.
We need information.

469
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:55,400
Come here, sweetie.
Come back.

470
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,400
Here.

471
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:09,000
Let go.

472
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:14,500
Let go.

473
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:17,500
Can you hold my turtle.
- Not now.

474
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:28,400
Hold on.

475
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:31,700
There you pay for.

476
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,300
Again.

477
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:01,100
Why have you brought us out of school?
- What does it matter. We are Fri

478
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,400
Why are you also on the front seat?
It is my day.

479
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:08,400
No, it is not.
- It's my day.

480
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,600
You're lying.
- No.

481
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:13,100
You sit there all of two days in a row.
- Silence.

482
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,800
I'm still hungry.

483
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:25,800
I do not think they have chicken legs.

484
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:29,800
Waiting inside.
I need to call.

485
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:40,700
This is firefly.
- By Bob Ho. I need help.

486
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:49,400
I get good grades at this university.
Best of the classroom. I would not brag.

487
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:52,200
Bob, this is Larry.
- Pleasant, sir.

488
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:55,100
Let's go get food.
- He goes to college.

489
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,900
He is a poet. Cool right?

490
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:03,700
He is rare. He is amazing.

491
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:06,800
He is the man.

492
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:10,700
Come on.

493
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,600
What embarrassing.

494
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:18,600
Most people may not be the first me
time they meet me. Larry is.

495
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:24,000
I have two words for you, Larry.
Thirteen.

496
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:45,400
I must.
- But come on.

497
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,100
You stay at the table.

498
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:55,700
I cannot go.

499
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:09,300
Note Pigs.

500
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,300
Careful.

501
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:25,600
The lion jumped on them, and I
I killed him with my bare hands.

502
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:28,200
And I have saved the life colonels.
- You're brave.

503
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,900
Thank you.

504
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:32,100
What do you think of this, Bob?

505
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,800
Nora and the waitress said
that Larry could sit here.

506
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:37,600
Is not that great.
- He has "Spade" invited or something.

507
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:40,200
We just kidding.

508
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:43,300
Nora, knock, knock.
- Who is it?

509
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:46,000
Irish Stew.
- Irish Stew, who?

510
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:49,300
Irish Stew in the name of the law.

511
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,200
Larry tells me everything about the university.
It sounds great.

512
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:56,600
I want you ever around.
- Calm down.

513
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,400
That decision not you.
You're not my father.

514
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:02,000
No, but I know that your mother
is not completely lost her mind.

515
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:06,400
It's just a tour.
He asks me out or anything.

516
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:09,000
Really?

517
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:12,000
It is but a kind offer.

518
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:15,100
Even though it was a date, it could
you do not stop me.

519
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:22,000
Where you study towards it?

520
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:25,300
English literature.
- Would you pass the soy sauce?

521
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,500
So I get my background in the classes.

522
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:32,800
Thank you.
- Please.

523
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:39,000
You speak Russian.
- What is going on?

524
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:02,100
This is painful.
- You are right in.

525
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:06,000
Hurry.

526
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:16,400
Maybe write a poem about here?

527
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:42,300
Well, he is too old for me.

528
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:46,200
I want a princess anymore,
but a cyborg.

529
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:49,400
How he found me so quickly?
That makes no sense.

530
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:52,900
Bob, what is going on?
- Still, I try to think.

531
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:58,500
Well.

532
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:02,400
I'm an international spy and
I'm with the CIA.

533
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:05,800
Of the Chinese CIA.
Someone wants me dead.

534
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:09,400
And Larry was a Russian spy.

535
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:12,300
Well, tell us not.

536
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:15,100
Cool.

537
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:22,000
Why is that came?

538
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:24,900
Stay here.

539
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Where are the kids?
- Inside.

540
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:31,700
Nothing is more out until
the children are safe.

541
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:35,000
Of course. Colton has a secure home
regularly, as you requested.

542
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:39,200
Did you file with you?
- Which file?

543
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:42,000
Your download those sent by Colton
Poldark of his computer.

544
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:45,200
I have nothing downloaded.
I did not even open anything.

545
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:48,500
Take me in the leg. This is secret
material. I have all the necessary copies.

546
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:51,700
Why do you think I have something gedownkoad.
Unless someone told you that.

547
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:53,200
Someone who wanted it back.

548
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:56,700
Let's not more difficult than
it is. Give me that file.

549
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:59,800
You're a Korean officer.
Why are you doing this?

550
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:02,100
I want to get out. Same as you.
We step out there both for love.

551
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,100
I just love money.

552
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:06,800
And Anton Poldark is match.com.
The file.

553
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,900
Good work.

554
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:31,000
Can I say you're the best man
that my mother has so far selected.

555
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,800
Now at least I know how Larry
found us so quickly.

556
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,700
How?
- The watch.

557
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:39,700
Curtis told me that I had to keep watch.
There is a tracking device in it.

558
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:47,600
You're really a spy.
- Gillian goes from her roof.

559
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,600
What are you doing?

560
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:13,700
There is iron in these rocks. This hides
a signal. Please watch.

561
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:19,300
When I tell this story in school, get
I am one year’s sentence for lying.

562
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:28,100
Yes?
- Hi, partner.

563
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:30,400
Where are you?

564
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:34,100
Why do you ask?
- I had to pick up the sent file.

565
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:37,100
The one you had open.

566
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:42,100
Are you there?

567
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:45,900
I never saw you as a traitor.
- That's crazy, man.

568
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,100
There is something wrong,
We must come together and talk.

569
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:52,300
Nice try.

570
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,400
We are safe here, promised.

571
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:05,200
This is your plan?
Hide in a hotel?

572
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:08,600
They also seem not to have chicken legs.

573
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:28,400
This is great.
Shall we call room service?

574
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:31,200
Are you crazy. I'm going home.
- No.

575
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:34,600
You're only safe with me.
- If you?

576
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:38,100
Everyone wants you dead.
- Yes. Great, right?

577
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:43,000
If you want to marry my mom,
I personally write the invitations.

578
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:13,700
I love you, Bob.

579
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:29,600
Infinite Bob.

580
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:34,200
Hello.
- Hi, Gillian.

581
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:38,400
Hi, honey. Grandpa just sleeping.
I just wanted to call.

582
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:40,700
I must tell you something.

583
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:43,800
This will hurt you down,
but I must say.

584
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:46,000
You okay?

585
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:48,800
Yes. It's about Bob.

586
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:51,700
What then?
- It's not who you think.

587
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:55,000
He is a Chinese spy.
Terrorists want to kill him...

588
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:59,800
and now the CIA is after him...
- Farren, I know you do not...

589
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:02,700
but I do not expect Ian
but not yours.

590
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:07,000
What? It is true.
He is still our death.

591
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:10,600
Farren, this conversation is over.
Give me Bob.

592
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:22,900
Hi, Gillian.
- I'm sorry. I am not sure what she has.

593
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:26,600
It is the truth.
- What?

594
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:30,400
All she said.

595
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:33,200
What this is, it is not funny.

596
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:36,900
The children are safe.
I provide them, if you're back.

597
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:41,500
You tell me so that I my
children left behind by a madman?

598
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,700
Come and get it also.

599
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:08,500
Do you have cool spy stuff,
outside the watch?

600
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,200
Do not touch.

601
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:18,100
Very sharp.

602
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,300
What else?

603
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:48,500
Sorry.

604
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:51,700
Airport. Hit it.

605
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:16,200
Bob, are you awake?
- Really?

606
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:20,500
He always snore?
- Do you hear even here?

607
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:24,200
I always thought it was the pig.

608
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,100
It's over between you and Gillian, huh?

609
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:33,600
Yes, it's over.

610
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,300
You win.

611
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,700
Why does it not then?

612
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:42,300
If you really love her,
you would not easily give up.

613
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:46,900
It is because I love her
and you keep three...

614
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:52,300
I should leave.
Your security is important.

615
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:56,700
I thought I was my other life
could forget, but I cannot.

616
01:02:56,800 --> 01:03:01,400
Be happy. You're lucky you
This family is not together.

617
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:07,400
You have no idea what it is like
you live where you do not belong.

618
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:13,000
Do not be sure.
I grew up an orphanage.

619
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:16,200
I never knew my parents,
but I had a family.

620
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:22,300
I had numerous brothers and sisters.
Without some kinship.

621
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,500
But I loved them all.

622
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:30,000
Family is not about blood...

623
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:33,500
but you love
and who loves you.

624
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:44,200
Mom.
- Gillian.

625
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:54,700
Gillian, I'm sorry for everything.

626
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:02,000
Tell me the truth.

627
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:04,600
Are you really a spy?

628
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:08,800
Yes. I wanted to tell you...

629
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:11,600
but you interrupted me.
- That I do not care.

630
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:15,100
You brought my children in danger.

631
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:17,800
Just go.

632
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,100
If we see you again?

633
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:30,700
Not.

634
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:44,200
Please do not.
Who sings Chinese songs for me then?

635
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:58,200
They were safe, promised.
- Stay away from my children.

636
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:48,500
Dearest Mum, I'm sorry,
but I cannot stay here.

637
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:51,900
My destiny is to be a spy,
just like Bob.

638
01:05:56,300 --> 01:06:02,700
I go with him.
Love, your son Ian.

639
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:43,600
The signal was getting right back on.

640
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:45,600
We have him.

641
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:49,200
Action.

642
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:20,100
You leave your watch.
- What are you doing here?

643
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:24,600
We must go.
- Why, we just got here.

644
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:39,900
What a coincidence.
Tie him up.

645
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:50,900
What are you doing here?
- I want it, I would also be a spy.

646
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:55,900
Is that bad? I expected
he would be better dressed.

647
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:58,400
How did you find me?

648
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:02,300
I stuck one of your opspoorapparaatjes
in your pocket.

649
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:04,900
Impressive.
- Thank you.

650
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:08,400
Are we back in business?
- I am retired you know.

651
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:12,400
If someone download no secrets.
- I have never downloaded.

652
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:15,400
He is lying.
- Who do you...

653
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:17,600
me, or the traitor?

654
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:22,000
Someone here has been very naughty.

655
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:25,900
He has cameras everywhere
and microphones placed.

656
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:32,000
A good plan to film us together.
- How can you turn back the country?

657
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:36,800
Simple. I am a multi millionaire.
That file you downloaded is not...

658
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:42,500
is a formula for a bacterial hybrid.
This stuff literally eat oil.

659
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:47,700
Imagine. All world oil
go at night in one way.

660
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:51,500
Apart from Russia,
which are gold.

661
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:56,500
Colton How have you convinced?
- Colton, who has nothing to do here.

662
01:08:56,600 --> 01:09:00,200
He has no idea what is happening.
For him is really struggling.

663
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:03,100
Let the boy go.
He has nothing to do.

664
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:07,800
Mr. tetterkont here has
just told the whole plan.

665
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:13,700
We cannot let him go.
He will tell.

666
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:17,200
Trust me, nobody believes him.

667
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:19,500
He has a point.

668
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:25,300
Baas. Look what I found.

669
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:31,300
Hello everyone.
- Please sit down.

670
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:34,200
This is not true.

671
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:38,600
Poldark, if you let the children go,
I think that you file for GBH.

672
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:42,400
GBH, GBH like Stockholm?

673
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:45,800
How do you know?
- It kidding.

674
01:09:45,900 --> 01:09:48,600
Is all this because
He downloaded a concert?

675
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:51,200
What has he done?

676
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:56,000
Did you downloaded?
- You take piracy seriously.

677
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:58,800
You've played with my PC?
That is private.

678
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:03,600
I just wanted to be cool.
- No need, that you already

679
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:06,900
One of the coolest person I know.
- Really?

680
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:11,400
Here, a man with a gun.

681
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:14,800
Wait, I'm the only child you know.

682
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:20,200
Where is the file?
- On my iPod, home to the office.

683
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:25,200
If you really want to be a spy,
you should never tell the truth.

684
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:27,600
Sorry, this is still new to me.

685
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:32,200
Take people into
to his house and find the iPod.

686
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:35,900
What if his family home?

687
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:39,000
Since you've dyed your hair blond...
Take them off.

688
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:44,500
No, no!
- Come, Bring me the iPod.

689
01:10:57,100 --> 01:11:00,200
And as for you...

690
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:48,900
Farren, we go.

691
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:53,400
I sit up front and decide the radio channel.

692
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:05,400
Hello?
- Gillian, listen to me.

693
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:07,900
Goodbye, Bob.

694
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:18,300
Wait! Do not hang on.

695
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:23,600
We have more than them.

696
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:33,200
Is there someone you vertouwt,
you can call the office?

697
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:36,600
Jule, but they took all my cameras.
I cannot prove anything.

698
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:42,400
Except when that happened,
I recorded everything on my phone.

699
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:45,800
Well done, idiot.

700
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:52,700
Colt. Listen to me.
I play something for you.

701
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:07,800
What is this?
- This is Halloween.

702
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:25,300
What are you doing here?
I thought you were upstairs.

703
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:28,000
Everyone quickly inside.
- Bob, we need to talk.

704
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:31,700
Mom, this is no joke.
Do what he says.

705
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:37,200
Find your iPod.
- IPod? I demand an explanation.

706
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:38,600
They are coming.
- Who?

707
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:40,900
The Russians.
- Russians?

708
01:13:55,900 --> 01:13:58,800
They are there.

709
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:03,300
Russians?
- Yes, keep you informed.

710
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:07,600
Quick, everyone up.

711
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:11,700
Stay there.

712
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:18,100
Where is my stuff?
- Here, have some of this stuff.

713
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:20,300
What things are they?
- Protection.

714
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,100
Why did you a lighter?
I do not want you play with fire.

715
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:34,600
Okay, just this once.
Let's go.

716
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:33,000
What do you suggest?
- A Cyborg from the future...

717
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:35,900
to blow you away.

718
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:45,300
Mum, that man could fly.

719
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:11,500
I cannot believe in us
have done this.

720
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:14,000
You have my children at risk.
- It is never my intention.

721
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:16,600
I love your kids.
I want to marry you.

722
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:19,700
And I with you.

723
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:22,500
But our wedding gifts to open
by the Mine Action Service.

724
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:26,100
Okay Bob, played enough games now.

725
01:16:32,700 --> 01:16:36,300
I'm finally a regular
man, someone who...

726
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:40,900
Can we talk about this later?

727
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:01,900
A belt?

728
01:17:12,300 --> 01:17:14,700
Give me the IPod.

729
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:22,700
Come to his house.

730
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:35,100
Hi, guys.

731
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:38,100
I have to go.

732
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:41,300
Maybe we should only
steal candy from small children.

733
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:51,900
This is fun.
- Hey Larry, knock knock...

734
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:14,100
Fast in your room
and put the door.

735
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:37,500
I arrest you in the name of the law.

736
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,200
Sorry that my timing is so
bad, Bob.

737
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:47,200
Kill me and let the family go.
- They have seen too much.

738
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:49,300
But you go first,
then you do not look.

739
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:51,100
Hey, mister...

740
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:59,300
Do not think this changes anything.

741
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:02,900
Everybody stop!
- It is in order...

742
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:04,800
they are good.

743
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:29,700
Do something looser.
- Sorry, the handcuffs are too tight?

744
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:33,800
I do not know how they worked,
I'm just a hillbilly.

745
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:38,200
Does everyone like it?
- On some bumps and scratches after.

746
01:19:38,300 --> 01:19:40,900
This is one of the really good people.

747
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:49,800
What have you here.
Good job you took that call.

748
01:19:49,900 --> 01:19:53,100
This young man can sometimes
be a good spy.

749
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:05,000
How fast can you get me out of this suit?

750
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:10,100
Sorry I accused you.
- No problem, buddy.

751
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:13,100
Let's at
an account.

752
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:15,500
Thank you.

753
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:30,200
Sorry to you all this
had to make them.

754
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:34,300
Goodbye, Gillian.

755
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:38,500
Goodbye, kids.

756
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:45,700
I will miss you.

757
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:48,100
I miss you too.

758
01:20:48,101 --> 01:20:50,101
Bob

759
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:56,500
Wait.

760
01:20:56,900 --> 01:21:03,300
I know he lied,
but he did to protect us.

761
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:06,900
Mum?

762
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:14,700
You'll never again find such a man as Bob.

763
01:21:15,100 --> 01:21:16,700
Never.

764
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:22,500
Never thought to say this again,
but I agree with Farren.

765
01:21:26,700 --> 01:21:28,700
You'll probably also be here
what to say about it?

766
01:21:28,900 --> 01:21:32,000
I want my dad Bob.

767
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:49,300
Do you, Gillian, Bob to be your lawful husband?
- Yes.

768
01:21:49,900 --> 01:21:53,400
And you Bob, do you Gillian
to be your lawful husband?

769
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:58,100
Gillian.

770
01:21:58,300 --> 01:22:04,900
There is one thing you must know,
My name is not really Bob.

771
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:09,100
That's okay.

772
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:12,200
Yes.

773
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:14,300
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

774
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:17,300
You may kiss the bride.

775
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:32,400
Ready and action.

776
01:22:57,200 --> 01:22:59,500
He is a crook, he could eat nails...

777
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:02,800
The boy takes all free.
Take him to blame.

778
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:06,100
That is such a crook, he could eat nails...

779
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:35,500
Bob, I want a princess anymore
but...

780
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:41,000
I'm an international spy.
I belong to the CIA...

781
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:45,600
From the Chinese...

782
01:23:46,700 --> 01:23:50,700
I grab some stuff and we
go to the house.

783
01:23:54,100 --> 01:23:58,800
I'm an international spy.
I belong to the CIA. From the Chinese...

784
01:23:58,900 --> 01:24:00,700
Information...

785
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:04,600
I've shot down dictators.
How difficult is it to 'three' to say.

786
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:15,800
Maybe write a poem about...

787
01:24:15,900 --> 01:24:19,000
Maybe you drive a poem about...

788
01:24:19,100 --> 01:24:24,600
Maybe you write...
I hate English.

789
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:34,300
And the man you married,
who marries you all four.

790
01:24:35,100 --> 01:24:39,200
Forget the pig, and cat
and not the turkey. The turkey...

791
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:44,400
Turkey.
Where did that come from turkey?

792
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,800
My grandmother...
Sorry.

793
01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:53,300
My grandmother is...

794
01:24:55,300 --> 01:24:58,300
If they screw up, then
I am happy.

795
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:02,300
Well done.
Come out.

796
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:04,500
