1
00:00:01,483 --> 00:00:02,700
<i>So here's what
you missed on Glee:</i>

2
00:00:02,784 --> 00:00:04,151
<i>Sue's pregnant,
which is crazy...</i>

3
00:00:04,202 --> 00:00:05,903
I had my eggs frozen
in the late '70s.

4
00:00:05,987 --> 00:00:06,853
<i>...and she won't say
who the father is,</i>

5
00:00:06,905 --> 00:00:08,372
<i>but insists that he's famous.</i>

6
00:00:08,456 --> 00:00:09,957
<i>Rachel and Finn
decided to get married</i>

7
00:00:10,024 --> 00:00:11,542
<i>after Regionals,
where the New Directions</i>

8
00:00:11,626 --> 00:00:13,494
<i>beat Sebastian and the Warblers
and a madrigal group</i>

9
00:00:13,545 --> 00:00:15,329
<i>that just sort of made
everyone uncomfortable.</i>

10
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,081
<i>And Sebastian made up with
Blaine after he realized</i>

11
00:00:17,165 --> 00:00:18,699
<i>life's too short to blind
people with rock salt.</i>

12
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,467
<i>Quinn thought Rachel and Finn
were too young to get married,</i>

13
00:00:20,535 --> 00:00:21,886
<i>and refused to go
to the wedding.</i>

14
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:23,837
...which makes me really sad,
because I would have loved

15
00:00:23,889 --> 00:00:25,639
to have seen you in
a bridesmaid's dress, Quinn.

16
00:00:25,707 --> 00:00:27,474
<i>...but then changed her mind
and started texting</i>

17
00:00:27,542 --> 00:00:28,392
<i>while she raced
to the courthouse,</i>

18
00:00:28,476 --> 00:00:29,894
<i>and her car got hit by a truck.</i>

19
00:00:29,978 --> 00:00:30,811
<i>And that's what
you missed on Glee!</i>

20
00:00:34,683 --> 00:00:36,016
(school bell ringing)

21
00:00:36,067 --> 00:00:37,651
So do you think if Quinn
hadn't gotten into her accident,

22
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:39,853
we still would've gone
through with the wedding?
Yeah, totally.

23
00:00:39,905 --> 00:00:41,722
Totally. I mean,
I'm kind of glad we're waiting.

24
00:00:41,773 --> 00:00:44,158
Now it doesn't have to be
a Justice of the Peace quickie.

25
00:00:44,225 --> 00:00:45,776
Hey, I was thinking
since Nationals

26
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,695
are in Chicago this year,

27
00:00:47,746 --> 00:00:49,697
we-we should have the wedding
someplace special.

28
00:00:49,748 --> 00:00:52,116
Like-like on the pitcher's mound
of Wrigley Field.

29
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,335
O-Or someplace else.
It's not that, it's Quinn.

30
00:00:54,402 --> 00:00:56,203
I can't stop thinking
about her. She's...

31
00:00:56,254 --> 00:00:58,589
Right behind you.

32
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:07,298
Hi, Quinn!
We missed you so much.

33
00:01:07,382 --> 00:01:09,466
No, don't.

34
00:01:09,551 --> 00:01:12,186
I could have easily become one
of those creepy memorial pages

35
00:01:12,253 --> 00:01:14,972
in the yearbook, but by
the grace of God, I'm here.

36
00:01:16,975 --> 00:01:18,859
Believe it or not...

37
00:01:18,926 --> 00:01:20,477
this is the happiest
day of my life.

38
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,031
Come on, Artie.
I'll race you to the choir room.

39
00:01:24,098 --> 00:01:25,816

(Quinn laughs)

83
00:03:17,595 --> 00:03:19,763
Here's a lesson for
your board, Mr. Shue.

84
00:03:19,848 --> 00:03:22,649
Don't text and drive. Ever.

85
00:03:22,717 --> 00:03:24,318
It's the stupidest thing
I've ever done.

86
00:03:24,385 --> 00:03:25,769
Besides sleeping with Puck.

87
00:03:25,854 --> 00:03:27,855
(quiet laughter)

88
00:03:27,906 --> 00:03:30,107
There's a lot of rumors floating
around, so let's clear the air.

89
00:03:30,225 --> 00:03:32,776
First of all, all my plumbing
still works, which is awesome.

90
00:03:32,861 --> 00:03:35,529
But my spine was severely
compressed in the car accident,

91
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,732
which basically means
I can't move my feet or legs.

92
00:03:38,783 --> 00:03:40,066
But the good thing is that

93
00:03:40,118 --> 00:03:41,902
I'm starting to regain feeling,

94
00:03:41,953 --> 00:03:45,539
so with a lot of physical
therapy, and your prayers,

95
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,257
I stand a good chance
for a full recovery.

96
00:03:47,342 --> 00:03:49,176
So no tears.

97
00:03:49,243 --> 00:03:51,745
That means you, Tina.

98
00:03:51,796 --> 00:03:53,764
Oh, and I apologize
for the number.

99
00:03:53,848 --> 00:03:56,183
My dance moves aren't
as smooth as Artie's yet.

100
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,935
With practice,
they will be.

101
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:05,592
I promise that by the time
we go to Nationals,

102
00:04:05,643 --> 00:04:07,694
I'll be out of this chair,

103
00:04:07,762 --> 00:04:09,747
and dancing on that stage.

104
00:04:09,814 --> 00:04:10,697
All right.

105
00:04:12,066 --> 00:04:13,784
Whoo!

106
00:04:23,378 --> 00:04:24,277
(school bell ringing)

107
00:04:24,329 --> 00:04:26,079
I'm sorry, I...

108
00:04:26,131 --> 00:04:28,832
I don't think I understand
what you just told me.

109
00:04:28,917 --> 00:04:31,235
I said, I'm making
swim coach Roz Washington

110
00:04:31,302 --> 00:04:33,453
co-coach of the Cheerios!

111
00:04:33,505 --> 00:04:36,640
How can you do this to me?

112
00:04:36,724 --> 00:04:38,275
ROZ:
I think I can answer
that question.

113
00:04:38,343 --> 00:04:41,478
This Saturday the Cheerios!
had Regionals tournament.

114
00:04:41,563 --> 00:04:44,348
You were 15 minutes late.
That's unacceptable.

115
00:04:44,432 --> 00:04:46,016
I had a doctor's appointment.

116
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,018
Oh... I know.
The doctor had to shine

117
00:04:48,102 --> 00:04:51,688
a flashlight in your va-jay-jay
to get all the bats to fly out.

118
00:04:51,773 --> 00:04:53,941
I understand that keeping
bats out of your womb

119
00:04:53,992 --> 00:04:57,110
is an important part of having a
baby when you're older than God.

120
00:04:57,162 --> 00:05:01,281
But it is no way to win
a national championship.
Sue...

121
00:05:01,332 --> 00:05:03,801
The lovely and talented
bronze medalist

122
00:05:03,868 --> 00:05:05,586
Roz Washington has a point.

123
00:05:05,653 --> 00:05:08,672
We need the money
and sponsorships that only

124
00:05:08,756 --> 00:05:10,457
a national championship
can bring to the school,

125
00:05:10,508 --> 00:05:13,794
and your condition is
compromising your work.

126
00:05:13,845 --> 00:05:15,262
It's settled.
My word is law.

127
00:05:15,329 --> 00:05:17,681
This will not stand!

128
00:05:17,765 --> 00:05:18,882
Oh, it's gonna stand.

129
00:05:18,967 --> 00:05:20,333
And you know what else
is gonna stand?

130
00:05:20,385 --> 00:05:23,554
Your fully-grown, adult baby

131
00:05:23,638 --> 00:05:26,523
when he pops out of your birth
canal, before he hurries off

132
00:05:26,608 --> 00:05:29,109
to the high-powered law firm
where he has just made partner.

133
00:05:29,176 --> 00:05:32,362
So take your Centrum Silver,
and your old ass,

134
00:05:32,447 --> 00:05:35,315
and find a new dream.

135
00:05:42,857 --> 00:05:45,692
What if I can guarantee you
a national championship?

136
00:05:45,743 --> 00:05:47,127
And how will you do that?

137
00:05:47,194 --> 00:05:49,246
The Glee Club.
If they win at Nationals,

138
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,882
the school wins
a $10,000 cash prize.

139
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:54,001
I get you that money,

140
00:05:54,052 --> 00:05:57,671
I get to run the cheerleading
program alone!

141
00:05:57,722 --> 00:06:00,173

Five, six, seven, eight!

142
00:06:00,225 --> 00:06:01,091
♪

143
00:06:07,348 --> 00:06:09,600
Stop! Please, stop!

144
00:06:09,684 --> 00:06:12,052
This is an embarrassment.

145
00:06:12,103 --> 00:06:14,171
Hey, Mercedes.
Who you texting?

146
00:06:14,239 --> 00:06:15,689
I'm not texting anyone,

147
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,025
I'm donating to
the Obama campaign...

148
00:06:18,076 --> 00:06:20,110
(screams)
My Droid!

149
00:06:20,194 --> 00:06:22,613
Good news! I booked a tour at
the Railroad Museum on Friday,

150
00:06:22,697 --> 00:06:25,365
which means we're gonna have
an awesome Senior's Ditch Day.

151
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:26,950
What is she doing here?
Hey, Granny Panties!

152
00:06:27,035 --> 00:06:28,619
I'm taking over Booty Camp1

153
00:06:28,703 --> 00:06:30,236
Why on earth do you
want to run Booty Camp?

154
00:06:30,288 --> 00:06:32,372
Because, as I established, I
want to help you win Nationals.

155
00:06:32,423 --> 00:06:34,708
And I am a champion
who can whip that squad

156
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:36,126
of pear-shaped teens into shape.

157
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:38,211
You're out of shape,
you're constantly late,

158
00:06:38,263 --> 00:06:39,630
and when you're not
too busy texting,

159
00:06:39,714 --> 00:06:40,931
you're complaining about

160
00:06:41,015 --> 00:06:42,849
the choreography
you're too lazy to learn.

161
00:06:42,917 --> 00:06:45,602
You're nothing but
a coven of tardy,

162
00:06:45,687 --> 00:06:48,272
narcissistic, bloated
bags of cellulite

163
00:06:48,356 --> 00:06:49,940
who will stab each other
in the back

164
00:06:50,024 --> 00:06:51,525
at the first glimpse of a solo

165
00:06:51,592 --> 00:06:54,811
in a competition hosted by
a late-night horror movie host.

166
00:06:54,896 --> 00:06:56,763
Well, those days are over.

167
00:06:56,814 --> 00:06:58,065
(school bell ringing)
Sue?

168
00:06:58,116 --> 00:06:59,533
We need to talk about what
happened at Booty Camp.

169
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,435
Oh, you mean my epic smack down
of the glee club over their

170
00:07:02,487 --> 00:07:04,538
complete apathy and
lack of professionalism?

171
00:07:04,605 --> 00:07:06,540
According to the kids,
you were typical abusive

172
00:07:06,607 --> 00:07:08,292
belligerent self,
only more so.

173
00:07:08,376 --> 00:07:10,327
I just got this
e-mail from Kurt.

174
00:07:10,411 --> 00:07:12,412
"Mr. Shue, save us!

175
00:07:12,463 --> 00:07:14,715
Coach Sue is meaner
than Tabatha!"
First of all,

176
00:07:14,782 --> 00:07:17,217
I have absolutely no idea who
Porcelain is referring to.

177
00:07:17,284 --> 00:07:19,219
I'm assuming it's gay and niche.

178
00:07:19,286 --> 00:07:20,804
Secondly, based on
the pathetic display

179
00:07:20,888 --> 00:07:22,622
I just saw?

180
00:07:22,674 --> 00:07:25,559
Your glee club's back-to-back
victories were flukes.

181
00:07:25,626 --> 00:07:26,727
Oh...
Against Vocal Adrenaline?

182
00:07:26,794 --> 00:07:28,679
On the national stage?

183
00:07:28,763 --> 00:07:30,296
You'll be like lambs
to the slaughter.

184
00:07:30,348 --> 00:07:33,183
Why are you resisting
my help, William?

185
00:07:33,267 --> 00:07:35,235
We should try to
inspire and encourage

186
00:07:35,302 --> 00:07:37,303
our kids, Sue,
not humiliate and crush them.

187
00:07:37,355 --> 00:07:38,638
I don't get it.

188
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,691
You were acting like you
had turned over a new leaf.

189
00:07:40,775 --> 00:07:42,609
William... I'm near the end
of my first trimester.

190
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,278
I'm wildly hormonal, riding out

191
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:47,480
massive, unpredictable
mood swings.

192
00:07:47,532 --> 00:07:50,000
Stop trying to
understand my actions.

193
00:07:50,084 --> 00:07:52,152
Maybe you should
talk to your doctor

194
00:07:52,203 --> 00:07:54,171
about adjusting your medication?
Oh, I'll ask.

195
00:07:54,255 --> 00:07:56,590
I'm going there this week to
confirm the sex of my daughter.

196
00:07:56,657 --> 00:07:59,626
Mm! Oh, Sue!
That's a mother-to-be

197
00:07:59,677 --> 00:08:01,845
single most important doctor
visit. Who's going with you?

198
00:08:01,929 --> 00:08:03,513
Same person who's going to
help me raise this child,

199
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:04,998
Barbara Gordon. No one.

200
00:08:05,049 --> 00:08:08,802
We'll...
Sue, you can't go alone.

201
00:08:08,853 --> 00:08:11,004
No, you need a friend there,
for moral support.

202
00:08:11,055 --> 00:08:12,639
I agree.

203
00:08:14,475 --> 00:08:16,643
We'll go with you.

204
00:08:18,012 --> 00:08:18,895
(school bell ringing)

205
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,346
You okay?

206
00:08:20,398 --> 00:08:21,498
You seem a little preoccupied.

207
00:08:21,566 --> 00:08:22,866
Oh, well, my brother's in town.

208
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,018
He's picking me up,
taking me out to lunch.

209
00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:26,519
Blaine, that's exciting!

210
00:08:26,571 --> 00:08:28,789
I finally get to meet this
mysterious brother of yours,

211
00:08:28,856 --> 00:08:30,123
who you refuse to talk about.

212
00:08:30,191 --> 00:08:31,708
I'm dying to know
what he looks like.

213
00:08:31,793 --> 00:08:33,543
Oh, trust me, you...

214
00:08:33,628 --> 00:08:34,911
you already know
what he looks like.

215
00:08:34,996 --> 00:08:36,496
Blainie!

216
00:08:36,547 --> 00:08:37,664
Hey, Coop!
Hey!

217
00:08:37,715 --> 00:08:39,416
Hey.
How are you, bud?

218
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,801
Good. Good to see you, man.

219
00:08:40,868 --> 00:08:41,868
This your,
this your boyfriend, here?

220
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,220
Actually, yes, it is.
Hi.

221
00:08:43,304 --> 00:08:45,338
Kurt, this is my brother...
Nice to meet you.

222
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,391
...Cooper Anderson.
Oh, my God.
You're the guy from

223
00:08:47,475 --> 00:08:48,558
the freecreditratingtoday.com
commercials!

224
00:08:48,643 --> 00:08:49,843
Guilty as charged.

225
00:08:49,894 --> 00:08:51,261
♪ Know your score

226
00:08:51,345 --> 00:08:54,014
♪ Freecreditratingtoday.com

00:08:54,065 --> 00:08:56,016

228
00:08:56,067 --> 00:09:00,487
I love those commercials!
The jingle's my ringtone!

229
00:09:00,554 --> 00:09:01,988
Excuse me, I'm sorry
to interrupt, but, um,

230
00:09:02,056 --> 00:09:03,490
I just needed to tell you

231
00:09:03,557 --> 00:09:05,909
that I am an enormous
fan of your work.

232
00:09:05,993 --> 00:09:06,993
Thank you.

233
00:09:07,061 --> 00:09:08,829
Will you sign my breast?
My pleasure.

234
00:09:09,864 --> 00:09:11,731
"Keep on dreaming.

235
00:09:11,783 --> 00:09:13,500
"Yours...
Mine.

236
00:09:13,567 --> 00:09:16,402
Cooper Anderson."

237
00:09:16,454 --> 00:09:18,004
You do me a great honor.

238
00:09:18,072 --> 00:09:20,590
And if Alan Menken isn't
personally writing you

239
00:09:20,675 --> 00:09:22,542
a fairy tale musical
at this very moment,

240
00:09:22,593 --> 00:09:25,178
I will hunt him down
and beat him senseless

241
00:09:25,246 --> 00:09:26,463
with a cudgel.
(laughs)

242
00:09:26,547 --> 00:09:31,101
Because you, sir,
are a Disney prince.

243
00:09:31,185 --> 00:09:33,019
Wow.

244
00:09:33,087 --> 00:09:36,356
God, it is great to be
back in the Midwest.

245
00:09:36,423 --> 00:09:38,608
My commercial's on hiatus,

246
00:09:38,693 --> 00:09:41,261
so I told my agent I was
headed back to the heartland

247
00:09:41,312 --> 00:09:43,947
to press the flesh,
do some character research.

248
00:09:44,031 --> 00:09:46,566
Next season's commercials have
a lot more intense, gritty

249
00:09:46,617 --> 00:09:48,201
character stuff, so
I really want to explore

250
00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:50,070
my salt-of-the-earth roots.

251
00:09:50,121 --> 00:09:51,938
Blaine, your brother's
the best-looking man
in North America.

252
00:09:51,989 --> 00:09:53,790
Um, Coop and I are gonna head...
Excuse me.

253
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:55,876
Gaston, if I could pull you
away from these ladies

254
00:09:55,943 --> 00:09:58,962
for just a moment; I have
something I'd like to ask you.

255
00:09:59,046 --> 00:10:01,581
Yeah. I mean, that's...

256
00:10:01,632 --> 00:10:04,384
that's why I never really
talk about my brother.

257
00:10:04,719 --> 00:10:04,719
+

258
00:10:06,753 --> 00:10:08,421
PUCK:
We all know why we're here.
I've waited five years for this.

259
00:10:08,472 --> 00:10:09,722
I want ideas for
Senior Ditch Day. Go.

260
00:10:09,789 --> 00:10:11,424
Ooh! A Gershwin/Sondheim
scavenger hunt!

261
00:10:11,475 --> 00:10:12,675
That sounds like torture.

262
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:14,427
We want actual ideas, Kurt.

263
00:10:14,478 --> 00:10:15,895
<i>How about a dance movie
marathon? Footloose...</i>

264
00:10:15,962 --> 00:10:17,763
<i>Footloose 2011.</i>

265
00:10:17,814 --> 00:10:19,398
What about a non-alcoholic
pub crawl?

266
00:10:19,466 --> 00:10:21,400
It's Senior Ditch Day, not
Senior Citizen's Ditch Day.

267
00:10:21,468 --> 00:10:23,853
It's springtime. I would like
to see something give birth.

268
00:10:23,937 --> 00:10:25,538
(giggling)

269
00:10:25,606 --> 00:10:27,857
Quinn, I'm so sorry.

270
00:10:27,925 --> 00:10:30,993
It was my wedding
that you were going to

271
00:10:31,078 --> 00:10:32,995
when you got into
your car crash, and...

272
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,580
you were answering
my text message, and now...

273
00:10:34,648 --> 00:10:36,165
we're all sitting here,
and we're talking about

274
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,251
this day that's supposed to be

275
00:10:38,318 --> 00:10:40,086
the most amazing
and unforgettable day

276
00:10:40,153 --> 00:10:42,088
of our high school lives,
and we're-we're completely

277
00:10:42,155 --> 00:10:44,640
ignoring the fact that
she's sitting in that chair?

278
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:47,510
It's not right.

279
00:10:47,594 --> 00:10:49,779
It's not right,
and it shouldn't be like this.

280
00:10:49,846 --> 00:10:51,631
Well, maybe not, but...

281
00:10:51,682 --> 00:10:53,549
this is the way it is.

282
00:10:53,634 --> 00:10:56,769
My accident, which you did
not cause, by the way,

283
00:10:56,836 --> 00:11:00,223
does not define me
or ruin our senior year.

284
00:11:00,307 --> 00:11:02,642
I meant what I said
in the choir room.

285
00:11:02,693 --> 00:11:05,311
I'm not gonna dwell on this, and
neither should any of you, okay?

286
00:11:05,362 --> 00:11:06,395
Come here.

287
00:11:12,786 --> 00:11:16,606
Come on.
(chuckles) Come on.

288
00:11:18,909 --> 00:11:21,244
Now, we are ditching as planned.

289
00:11:22,546 --> 00:11:24,914
I think we should go
to Six Flags.

290
00:11:24,998 --> 00:11:27,032
The Lady Fabray has chosen
wisely. Six Flags it is.

291
00:11:27,084 --> 00:11:28,200
Meeting adjourned.

292
00:11:28,252 --> 00:11:29,552
Hey!

293
00:11:29,636 --> 00:11:31,537
Hey, Finn, can you hang back
for a sec?

294
00:11:31,588 --> 00:11:32,922
The Apple guy.

295
00:11:33,006 --> 00:11:35,057
The Facebook guy.
Abraham Lincoln.

296
00:11:35,142 --> 00:11:36,809
What do these guys all have
in common with us?

297
00:11:36,876 --> 00:11:38,711
I don't know.
They were all in a show choir?

298
00:11:38,762 --> 00:11:41,147
None of 'em were
taken seriously in
high school, dude.

299
00:11:41,214 --> 00:11:42,715
They were written off
by the world

300
00:11:42,766 --> 00:11:44,150
until they got
the big idea.

301
00:11:44,217 --> 00:11:45,985
Then bingo!
The rest is history.

302
00:11:46,052 --> 00:11:47,520
Okay. So what's your big idea?

303
00:11:47,571 --> 00:11:51,357
Lima's only got 22 pools.

304
00:11:51,408 --> 00:11:53,242
Southern California has
800 freaking thousand!

305
00:11:53,327 --> 00:11:54,560
I Googled it.

306
00:11:54,611 --> 00:11:57,697
So after graduation,
I'm gonna move to L.A.

307
00:11:57,748 --> 00:11:59,565
and expand my
pool cleaning business.

308
00:11:59,616 --> 00:12:01,367
And I want you to be
my business partner.

309
00:12:01,418 --> 00:12:02,868
With your brains
and my jaw line,

310
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:04,403
I'm telling you,
we'd kill it.

311
00:12:04,454 --> 00:12:07,173
Wow, dude, I'm so honored
that you'd even consider me.

312
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,574
But you know, after we graduate,

313
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,259
I'm going to New York
with Rachel.

314
00:12:10,344 --> 00:12:13,713
Okay. Let's say you weren't,
just 'cause maybe she doesn't

315
00:12:13,764 --> 00:12:16,599
get into that fancy school
or you don't get married
right away.

316
00:12:16,683 --> 00:12:18,384
We are. It's gonna happen.

317
00:12:18,435 --> 00:12:19,418
Okay.

318
00:12:19,469 --> 00:12:21,721
But, hey, could
you do me a favor?

319
00:12:21,772 --> 00:12:23,589
Um, you know that
blonde on Sycamore Street

320
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,608
that likes to mow
her lawn in tube tops?

321
00:12:25,692 --> 00:12:26,925
Yeah, Mrs. Tennison.
Yeah.

322
00:12:26,977 --> 00:12:28,260
Well, her Jacuzzi's busted.

323
00:12:28,312 --> 00:12:30,396
So, I thought since you know
so much about motors,

324
00:12:30,447 --> 00:12:32,481
you could take a look at it.
Help me out.

325
00:12:32,566 --> 00:12:34,950
Yeah. All right,
I could probably do that.

326
00:12:35,035 --> 00:12:36,485
(bell ringing)

327
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:41,073
Lazy idiots, your leader
Will Schuester has informed me

328
00:12:41,124 --> 00:12:43,743
that my teaching methods
are harsh and too extreme.

329
00:12:43,794 --> 00:12:47,013
So I've decided to show you
what a real artist looks

330
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,714
and acts like.

331
00:12:48,782 --> 00:12:52,918
Ladies and gays,
as my gift to you,

332
00:12:52,969 --> 00:12:54,637
which you do not deserve,

333
00:12:54,721 --> 00:12:57,306
I give you
Porcelain's famous brother...

334
00:12:57,391 --> 00:12:58,391
Actually, it's my brother.

335
00:12:58,458 --> 00:12:59,809
...Cooper Anderson.

336
00:13:02,062 --> 00:13:03,062
Thank you, Sue.

337
00:13:05,232 --> 00:13:06,982
Namaste.
Okay.

338
00:13:07,067 --> 00:13:10,019
Guys, it was just a few years
ago that I was sitting

339
00:13:10,103 --> 00:13:13,489
in a sad drab room like this
with dreams like yours

340
00:13:13,573 --> 00:13:16,308
that I thought would
never come true.

341
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,477
But you know what?
They did.

342
00:13:18,528 --> 00:13:22,531
So, tomorrow, at Sue's
insistence, I will be teaching

343
00:13:22,616 --> 00:13:25,201
a Master class in acting
for anyone who's interested

344
00:13:25,285 --> 00:13:27,319
in becoming successful
in the business like me.

345
00:13:27,371 --> 00:13:28,587
Fantastic!

346
00:13:30,924 --> 00:13:32,324
Cooper, we can't
thank you enough.

347
00:13:32,376 --> 00:13:35,127
This is so generous of you to
share your time and expertise.

348
00:13:35,178 --> 00:13:37,763
Well, it's very clear that
the Anderson brothers
are very talented,

349
00:13:37,831 --> 00:13:40,499
and I'm sure that there were
many a family holiday

350
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,885
where the two of you
maybe did a little duet
by the piano?

351
00:13:42,969 --> 00:13:45,838
Actually, it's funny that you
should mention that because

352
00:13:45,889 --> 00:13:47,506
Blaine and I were famous
around the neighborhood.

353
00:13:47,557 --> 00:13:48,841
Not famous.

354
00:13:48,892 --> 00:13:51,677
We were pretty famous
around the neighborhood

355
00:13:51,728 --> 00:13:52,978
for our dueling
Simon LeBon impressions.

356
00:13:53,029 --> 00:13:56,148
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Please don't make me do that.

357
00:13:56,199 --> 00:13:57,283
Oh, no, Blaine,
you have to.

358
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,401
You're both so
handsome and good.

359
00:13:58,485 --> 00:14:00,236
Come on, Blaine.
What do you say?

360
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,321
How about a little Duran Duran?
Is that okay?

361
00:14:02,372 --> 00:14:03,956
Yeah.
Come on.

362
00:14:04,023 --> 00:14:05,825
Okay, okay, okay.

363
00:14:07,193 --> 00:14:08,994
You're on, Cooper.

364
00:14:09,045 --> 00:14:10,713
Ooh, the cardigan's
coming off.
Whoo!

Oh, cheers.

407

Bless you.
Why do you do that?

408
00:16:33,949 --> 00:16:36,951
Service industry is a great
place to try out new accents.

409

Keeps your instrument
from getting rusty.

411
00:16:39,921 --> 00:16:41,339
Will do.

So, nice job on
the song today.
Really nice.

413
00:16:44,259 --> 00:16:47,294
Oh, thank you.
You were a little
pitchy on "Rio,"

414
00:16:47,379 --> 00:16:49,296
and your moves lacked a theme,
though.

415
00:16:49,381 --> 00:16:53,050
My theme was dancing,
I guess.
But you have to give in to it.

of the body,"

418
00:16:56,772 --> 00:17:00,191
but he never mentioned
that the toes are the ears.

419
00:17:00,258 --> 00:17:01,642
You're unbelievable.

420
00:17:01,727 --> 00:17:03,927
What do you mean?
What are you doing?
What?

421
00:17:03,979 --> 00:17:07,064
All you ever do is tell me
what I'm doing wrong.

422
00:17:07,115 --> 00:17:08,949
You waste no opportunity
to remind me

423
00:17:09,034 --> 00:17:11,118
how much I suck
at, like, everything.

(Hanson's "MMMBop" playing)
No, no. Come on, Blaine.

Your balance is
completely off.

426
00:17:15,157 --> 00:17:18,659
I just learned to walk
three years ago.

427
00:17:18,744 --> 00:17:21,412
If that happened, I'm so sorry.

428
00:17:21,463 --> 00:17:23,164
But I don't,
I don't remember it.

429
00:17:23,248 --> 00:17:24,248
Of course you don't.

430
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:26,300
Hey, hey, little brother,

431
00:17:26,385 --> 00:17:29,086
I know there is an age
difference between us,

432
00:17:29,137 --> 00:17:31,288
But I'd really want
to be closer to you.

433
00:17:31,356 --> 00:17:33,724
I want to get to know you
a little better,

434
00:17:33,792 --> 00:17:35,926
all right?

435
00:17:35,977 --> 00:17:37,428
That's why I'm here.

436
00:17:37,479 --> 00:17:40,347
Yeah. No, I would love that.
I'd like that.

437
00:17:40,432 --> 00:17:41,632
Great! So you're gonna come

438
00:17:41,683 --> 00:17:43,100
to my Master class tomorrow,
right?

439
00:17:43,151 --> 00:17:44,735
<i>Right?
Yeah, sure.</i>

440
00:17:44,803 --> 00:17:46,270

You can do this.

453
00:18:16,635 --> 00:18:18,719
I'm not gonna make it.

454
00:18:18,804 --> 00:18:19,553
You will!

00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,665
BOTH:
Two...

471
00:18:47,716 --> 00:18:49,800
one... zero.

472
00:18:49,868 --> 00:18:51,802
You made it!
Whoo!

473
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:52,887
Oh, my God.

474
00:18:52,971 --> 00:18:54,672
Whoo!

475
00:18:54,723 --> 00:18:56,590
(both laughing)

476
00:18:58,143 --> 00:18:59,560
Now just stay
up there.

477
00:18:59,644 --> 00:19:01,812
I would say that was one

478
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,647
of the hardest
things I've ever done.

479
00:19:03,715 --> 00:19:05,215
Until you go
to Six Flags.

480
00:19:05,267 --> 00:19:06,884
Look, I'm not trying
to be a buzzkill,

481
00:19:06,935 --> 00:19:08,235
but going to an
amusement park

482
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,603
when you're in
a wheelchair--

483
00:19:09,688 --> 00:19:11,105
especially if you're
still getting used to it--

484
00:19:11,189 --> 00:19:12,439
can kind of
be a drag.

485
00:19:12,524 --> 00:19:15,075
Artie, it's Senior Ditch Day.

486
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,828
It's the only Senior Ditch Day
I'm ever going to have.

487
00:19:17,896 --> 00:19:20,331
I completely agree,
which is why I want you to come

488
00:19:20,398 --> 00:19:21,332
with me on Friday.

489
00:19:21,399 --> 00:19:22,783
I promise you,

490
00:19:22,868 --> 00:19:25,419
it will be the most amazing,
incredible and inspiring

491
00:19:25,504 --> 00:19:27,087
Ditch Day ever.

492
00:19:27,172 --> 00:19:28,172
(bell ringing)

493
00:19:28,239 --> 00:19:30,073
Whoo!

494
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:33,511
Welcome, guys, to the Cooper
Anderson Acting Master class.

495
00:19:33,578 --> 00:19:34,912
Thank you. Yes.

496
00:19:34,963 --> 00:19:37,431
Buckle your seat belts, kids,
buckle your seat belts

497
00:19:37,516 --> 00:19:40,584
'cause I'm about
to pour you a tall glass of

498
00:19:40,635 --> 00:19:41,886
"This is how it is."

499
00:19:41,937 --> 00:19:43,437
First thing you're gonna
want to know:

500
00:19:43,522 --> 00:19:46,023
Don't go to college.
It is a waste of time.

501
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:47,141
Number two:

502
00:19:47,225 --> 00:19:48,976
Don't go to New York.

503
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:51,478
Theater is lame
and Broadway is dead.

504
00:19:51,563 --> 00:19:53,113
Real actors do TV and film,

505
00:19:53,198 --> 00:19:55,449
which means Hollywood
is where it's at.

506
00:19:55,534 --> 00:19:57,568
Now let's talk headshots.

507
00:19:57,619 --> 00:20:00,738
Always, without fail,
turn into a pose.

508
00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:02,289
Again.
CLASS: Wow.

509
00:20:02,374 --> 00:20:03,624
And again.
CLASS: Ooh...

510
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,576
And one more time.
CLASS: Oh, yeah!

511
00:20:05,627 --> 00:20:07,878
Yes, that is a dynamic headshot,
and bam,

512
00:20:07,946 --> 00:20:10,247
you just got your first
callback. So now you've got

513
00:20:10,298 --> 00:20:12,333
your "sides."
Your foot's in the door.

514
00:20:12,417 --> 00:20:14,284
What do you do next?
Gotta figure out,

515
00:20:14,336 --> 00:20:16,220
is it comedic or is it dramatic?

516
00:20:16,287 --> 00:20:18,005
Often, it's hard to tell, right?

517
00:20:18,089 --> 00:20:20,123
So do what I do:
ask the director.

518
00:20:20,175 --> 00:20:21,642
"Is this scene comedic
or dramatic?"

519
00:20:21,726 --> 00:20:23,761
He will know you're an
actor who's not afraid

520
00:20:23,812 --> 00:20:25,262
to ask the tough questions,
right?

521
00:20:25,313 --> 00:20:26,847
Why are you writing this down?

522
00:20:26,932 --> 00:20:28,265
Okay, what's the key
to a dramatic scene?

523
00:20:28,316 --> 00:20:29,433
Finding the emotion.

524
00:20:29,484 --> 00:20:31,185
Connecting
with your scene partner.

525
00:20:31,269 --> 00:20:33,020
Oh, no, no and no.

526
00:20:33,104 --> 00:20:35,356
The key to a dramatic scene
is pointing.

527
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,324
When people are
really emotional,

528
00:20:37,409 --> 00:20:40,160
they point their fingers a lot.

529
00:20:40,245 --> 00:20:41,862
That's not true
at all.

530
00:20:41,947 --> 00:20:43,313
That's... that's
terrible advice.

531
00:20:43,365 --> 00:20:46,083
Excuse me, guys, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Blaine.

532
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:47,835
Are you an internationally
beloved spokesman

533
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,537
for the Internet's fastest-
growing credit score Web site?

534
00:20:50,622 --> 00:20:51,872
GIRL: No.

535
00:20:51,957 --> 00:20:53,657
I didn't think so.

536
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:55,826
So let's focus in, okay?
I'm here for you.

537
00:20:55,877 --> 00:20:57,428
I don't normally do this,

538
00:20:57,495 --> 00:20:59,513
but because you're in brother's
class and you guys are so nice,

539
00:20:59,598 --> 00:21:01,131
I'm gonna give you some
Level II stuff.

540
00:21:01,182 --> 00:21:04,101
(excited chatter)

541
00:21:09,007 --> 00:21:10,941
The secret to great acting,

542
00:21:11,009 --> 00:21:12,576
<i>great acting:</i>

543
00:21:12,644 --> 00:21:16,530
ignoring whatever
the other actor is doing.

544
00:21:16,615 --> 00:21:20,234
Eye contact with a scene partner
is incredibly distracting.

545
00:21:20,318 --> 00:21:21,952
I try to tune them out entirely.

546
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,203
Sometimes I wear earplugs.

547
00:21:23,288 --> 00:21:25,039
That way, I don't get distracted
by what

548
00:21:25,123 --> 00:21:29,860
they're doing, and I can focus
on the awesome acting choices

549
00:21:29,911 --> 00:21:31,194
I've planned ahead of time.

550
00:21:31,246 --> 00:21:32,830
Like eating
a roast beef sandwich, right?

551
00:21:32,881 --> 00:21:35,532
Other choices I can plan
ahead of time:

552
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:36,834
screaming all my lines!

553
00:21:36,885 --> 00:21:39,036
Because I'm really intense.

554
00:21:39,087 --> 00:21:40,871
And the things
I'm feeling are really intense!

555
00:21:40,922 --> 00:21:42,172
Because I'm an intense actor!

556
00:21:42,223 --> 00:21:43,057
(laughter)

557
00:21:43,141 --> 00:21:45,709
Nicholas Cage, right?!

558
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,378
Yeah, yeah!
Whoo!

559
00:21:49,547 --> 00:21:50,213
Bravo.

560
00:21:51,983 --> 00:21:54,485
All right, guys, I don't want
you to go cray-cray,

561
00:21:54,552 --> 00:21:58,221
but I brought in "sides--"
industry term--

562
00:21:58,273 --> 00:22:01,025
from a little show that
I auditioned for last week...

563
00:22:01,076 --> 00:22:02,392
<i>called NCIS.</i>

564
00:22:02,444 --> 00:22:03,610
What does that stand for?
(students murmuring)

565
00:22:03,695 --> 00:22:05,162
Oh, my nana loves that show!

566
00:22:06,898 --> 00:22:10,451
Now in this scene, Agent Sciuto
has just discovered a dead body.

567
00:22:10,535 --> 00:22:12,235
Who knows what will unfold?

568
00:22:12,287 --> 00:22:13,537
Don't look at each other.
Action.

569
00:22:13,588 --> 00:22:14,738
Here's what we know.

570
00:22:14,806 --> 00:22:16,206
Sergeant Pembroke
took a bullet

571
00:22:16,257 --> 00:22:17,424
at point-blank range.
What we don't know

572
00:22:17,509 --> 00:22:19,043
is why he's wearing a dress.

573
00:22:19,094 --> 00:22:20,511
There's a rumor that Sergeant
Pembroke was a transvestite.

574
00:22:20,578 --> 00:22:21,912
No, Blaine, say
the line again,

575
00:22:21,963 --> 00:22:23,297
but this time,
point your finger.

576
00:22:23,381 --> 00:22:24,915
Things are serious; a
man in a dress is dead.

577
00:22:24,966 --> 00:22:26,100
I don't really
feel like pointing, Coop.

578
00:22:26,184 --> 00:22:27,718
Just feels a little stupid.

579
00:22:27,769 --> 00:22:29,753
Well, when a choice feels wrong,
it's actually a good sign.

580
00:22:29,804 --> 00:22:31,188
It means you're right
on the edge, man.

581
00:22:31,255 --> 00:22:33,023
See, I don't know about that.
I feel like when a choice...

582
00:22:33,091 --> 00:22:34,441
(both arguing)

583
00:22:34,526 --> 00:22:36,193
Coop, you're my brother!

584
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,562
Can't you just support me?

585
00:22:40,115 --> 00:22:42,733
I'm sorry, are you
talking to me right now?

586
00:22:42,784 --> 00:22:44,451
Because I can't tell
if you're talking to me

587
00:22:44,536 --> 00:22:46,453
if you don't
point your finger.

588
00:22:46,538 --> 00:22:47,871
Right?
(students murmuring agreement)

589
00:22:47,939 --> 00:22:50,124
That is lesson number one,
guys, right?

590
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:51,575
Scene. Scene. Scene.

591
00:22:51,626 --> 00:22:52,659
Good work, buddy.

592
00:22:52,744 --> 00:22:53,744
We'll get 'em
next time.

593
00:22:53,795 --> 00:22:55,329
Let's go! Whoo!
Let's move on

594
00:22:55,413 --> 00:22:57,965
to a little acting exercise
that I like to call

595
00:22:58,049 --> 00:22:59,800
The Emotion Tornado.

596
00:22:59,884 --> 00:23:01,218
Get your hands
up to the sky...

597
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:04,755
Just a busted control
panel, Mrs. Tennison.

598
00:23:04,806 --> 00:23:05,806
Nothing too serious.

599
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:07,124
You're a lifesaver.

600
00:23:07,175 --> 00:23:08,291
Noah told me
you're going

601
00:23:08,343 --> 00:23:09,343
into business together.

602
00:23:09,427 --> 00:23:11,678
No, I said we were
thinking about it.

603
00:23:11,763 --> 00:23:12,930
Well, I think it's a great idea.

604
00:23:12,981 --> 00:23:14,131
And if you need any investors,

605
00:23:14,182 --> 00:23:16,016
I'd love to be a
silent partner.

606
00:23:16,101 --> 00:23:17,968
Or a noisy one.

607
00:23:22,757 --> 00:23:24,875
In California,
she's considered ugly.

608
00:23:27,078 --> 00:23:29,847
Dude, I'm not going to L.A.

609
00:23:29,914 --> 00:23:31,215
Okay, end of discussion.

610
00:23:31,266 --> 00:23:33,383
Let me just say this,
and I'll shut up forever.

611
00:23:33,435 --> 00:23:35,018
If getting hitched
is a team effort,

612
00:23:35,086 --> 00:23:36,419
why are you the one that's
always giving up everything?

613
00:23:36,471 --> 00:23:37,587
Maybe it's time
for Rachel to start

614
00:23:37,639 --> 00:23:38,605
thinking about you
for a change.

615
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:39,923
It's not like
you're asking her

616
00:23:39,974 --> 00:23:41,191
to sacrifice her career.

617
00:23:41,259 --> 00:23:42,476
You heard Blaine's
famous brother.

618
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,228
L.A. is where it's at.

619
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:45,428
Rachel could probably
get on TV,

620
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,763
play the quirky
next-door girl or whatever.

621
00:23:46,815 --> 00:23:48,482
And you could
try acting, too.

622
00:23:48,566 --> 00:23:50,951
Or go to college.
This could be your day job.

623
00:23:51,035 --> 00:23:52,870
You spend so much time
thinking only about her.

624
00:23:52,937 --> 00:23:55,405
Take a couple seconds
and think about yourself.

625
00:23:58,015 --> 00:23:58,015
+

626
00:23:58,927 --> 00:24:00,094
I can barely focus.

627
00:24:00,178 --> 00:24:01,679
The thought of a boy
clinging to my insides

628
00:24:01,746 --> 00:24:03,264
is making me even more nauseous.

629
00:24:03,348 --> 00:24:05,549
Sue, maybe you should wait to
find out the sex of the baby.

630
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,934
Besides, boys aren't
so bad anyway.

631
00:24:07,018 --> 00:24:08,552
They're disgusting.

632
00:24:08,603 --> 00:24:10,137
They have terrible aim when
peeing, they're weak-minded,

633
00:24:10,222 --> 00:24:11,856
and when will someone
give me a straight answer

634
00:24:11,923 --> 00:24:13,023
as to why they have nipples?

635
00:24:13,091 --> 00:24:14,091
Sue Sylvester.

636
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:18,095
Right this way, please.

637
00:24:20,315 --> 00:24:21,866
I'm sorry,
is this the father?

638
00:24:21,933 --> 00:24:23,117
Uh, no, no.
God, no.

639
00:24:23,201 --> 00:24:25,653
Uh, these are...
these are my friends.

640
00:24:25,737 --> 00:24:26,904
Mm-hmm.

641
00:24:26,955 --> 00:24:28,605
Sounds so weird coming
out of my mouth.

642
00:24:28,657 --> 00:24:30,607
Here for moral support?
Yes, exactly.

643
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:32,543
Anything you have to say to me,
you can say in front of them.

644
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:33,911
DOCTOR:
Okay.

645
00:24:33,962 --> 00:24:35,913
Well, looking at
your test results,

646
00:24:35,964 --> 00:24:37,781
your baby is a girl.

647
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:38,782
Yes!
Ah!
A girl!

648
00:24:38,834 --> 00:24:39,950
Come on, now.
(all laughing)

649
00:24:40,001 --> 00:24:41,085
There we go.

650
00:24:41,136 --> 00:24:42,119
Oh, my toilet
seats are spared.

651
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:44,454
However...

652
00:24:45,507 --> 00:24:46,891
However?

653
00:24:46,958 --> 00:24:49,960
Your amnio came back
with irregularities.

654
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:56,100
So, Coop, have you met
George Clooney?
Not yet.

655
00:24:56,151 --> 00:24:57,518
But I have had sex

656
00:24:57,602 --> 00:24:59,737
with the Progressive
Insurance lady.
Perfect.

657
00:24:59,804 --> 00:25:01,021
Don't be a stranger,
all right?

658
00:25:01,106 --> 00:25:02,773
Follow me on Twitter.
All right.

659
00:25:02,824 --> 00:25:03,741
Tweet me.

660
00:25:03,808 --> 00:25:05,826
Yeah!

661
00:25:05,911 --> 00:25:07,528
Ask me why I am
so happy, Squirt.

662
00:25:07,612 --> 00:25:08,779
Don't call me that.

663
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,331
My life just
completely changed.

664
00:25:10,415 --> 00:25:12,666
I just got an audition
for a Michael Bay movie.

665
00:25:12,751 --> 00:25:13,918
Oh, that's great.

666
00:25:13,985 --> 00:25:15,586
Hello? Did you hear me?
Michael freakin' Bay.

667
00:25:15,653 --> 00:25:17,087
The movie's untitled,

668
00:25:17,155 --> 00:25:20,674
<i>which you know is code
for Transformers 4.</i>

669
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:22,343
You don't seem
very happy for me.

670
00:25:22,427 --> 00:25:23,493
Oh, I'm thrilled.

671
00:25:23,545 --> 00:25:24,962
Well, you got
a weird way of showing it.

672
00:25:25,013 --> 00:25:26,380
It wouldn't
kill you to smile.

673
00:25:26,464 --> 00:25:28,165
Also wouldn't kill you
to stop letting Kurt

674
00:25:28,216 --> 00:25:29,183
pick out your clothes.

675
00:25:29,267 --> 00:25:30,217
He d-does not.

676
00:25:30,302 --> 00:25:31,518
Mm-hmm, could've fooled me.

677
00:25:31,603 --> 00:25:32,887
Come on, man,
we'll have our own ditch day.

678
00:25:32,971 --> 00:25:34,438
You can help me run lines.

679
00:25:34,505 --> 00:25:37,224
It's all about
you, isn't it?

680
00:25:37,309 --> 00:25:40,227
Well, you know what, big
brother, I'm sick of it.

681
00:25:40,312 --> 00:25:42,279
And I'm not going
to take it anymore.

My toes.
I'm sorry, man.

738
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,620
Hey.

739
00:28:03,671 --> 00:28:05,489
What were you doing?

740
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,590
Uh, texting...
Texting while walking.

741
00:28:06,657 --> 00:28:08,175
That's exactly
how I started.

742
00:28:08,259 --> 00:28:10,010
Well, I don't usually
text while...
Think about it.

743
00:28:10,095 --> 00:28:12,179
You know, luckily enough,
the guy that crashed into me

744
00:28:12,263 --> 00:28:14,431
while I was texting is fine,
but, you know, I...

745
00:28:14,499 --> 00:28:15,482
Okay.
You should really

746
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:17,000
not do that anymore.

747
00:28:17,052 --> 00:28:18,168
No more texting, okay?

748
00:28:18,219 --> 00:28:19,553
Well, unless
I'm in class

749
00:28:19,637 --> 00:28:21,972
or, you know, on the toilet
or at a movie or something.

750
00:28:22,023 --> 00:28:23,273
Thank you.

751
00:28:23,341 --> 00:28:24,608
What's going on?

752
00:28:24,675 --> 00:28:26,560
Oh, well,
that's funny you're here.

753
00:28:26,644 --> 00:28:28,062
I was just, uh,

confirming the ditch day

755

Oh, count us out.

756
00:28:31,232 --> 00:28:32,616
What? Why?

757
00:28:32,683 --> 00:28:35,869
Because we have a super special
senior ditch day planned,

765
00:28:51,254 --> 00:28:54,340
maple-y toaster pastries that
you're not interrupting me?

What do you want, Jackson?
Spit it out.

767

I heard about your baby.

00:29:01,431 --> 00:29:02,398
You did?

769
00:29:02,482 --> 00:29:03,566
Yeah.

770
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:06,352

a baby girl.

Yeah.

00:29:09,489 --> 00:29:10,523
Come here.

Don't start lactating.

00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,865
Can I give you
a parenting tip?

778
00:29:19,916 --> 00:29:22,284
Sure.

779
00:29:22,369 --> 00:29:25,004
Try to work on your patience.

780

(mechanical whirring)

782
00:29:37,884 --> 00:29:39,418
You gonna tell me
what we're doing here?

783
00:29:39,469 --> 00:29:40,519
Just follow me.
It's up here.

784
00:29:42,755 --> 00:29:44,356
What is this?

785
00:29:44,424 --> 00:29:46,525
This is where we go to play
on Senior Ditch Day.

Thank you.

836
00:32:10,236 --> 00:32:12,204
This was a really great
Senior Ditch Day.

837
00:32:12,255 --> 00:32:13,672
You were right.
I just wanted you

838
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,090
to meet a cool
group of people

839
00:32:15,175 --> 00:32:17,909
having a great time in
the same situation as you.

840
00:32:17,961 --> 00:32:21,296
Yeah, but I'm not...

841
00:32:21,381 --> 00:32:22,748
This is only temporary.

842
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,850
The doctor said
it's a matter of time before...

843
00:32:24,917 --> 00:32:26,084
Look, I've been
where you are.

844
00:32:26,136 --> 00:32:27,269
I know how it feels,

845
00:32:27,353 --> 00:32:28,721
but you can't keep denying...

846
00:32:28,772 --> 00:32:30,305
I'm not denying anything.

847
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:31,640
You're not me.

848
00:32:31,725 --> 00:32:33,091
Okay?

849
00:32:33,143 --> 00:32:35,044
I'm not like you.
This isn't my life.

850
00:32:35,111 --> 00:32:37,429
I'm going to Yale,
I'm getting out of Lima,

851
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,264
and I'm going to walk again.

852
00:32:39,315 --> 00:32:40,616
And what if you don't?

853
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,267
When are you going
to stop pretending

854
00:32:42,318 --> 00:32:44,069
that this isn't really
happening to you?

855
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:47,757
+

856
00:32:48,826 --> 00:32:50,710
(school bell ringing)

857
00:32:50,795 --> 00:32:52,629
No, no.

858
00:32:52,696 --> 00:32:55,415
Maybe you should
request a lower locker.

859
00:32:55,499 --> 00:32:57,033
Could be easier.

860
00:32:57,084 --> 00:32:59,386
No. This has always
been my locker

861
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:02,756
and will continue to be
until I walk across that stage

862
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,591
in my cap and gown
and get my diploma.

863
00:33:04,675 --> 00:33:06,309
I gotta get to class.

864
00:33:06,377 --> 00:33:07,260
Can I walk with you?

865
00:33:08,429 --> 00:33:09,930
I've been praying for you.

866
00:33:10,014 --> 00:33:13,400
Well, guess it could help for
God to hear from a few people.

867
00:33:13,484 --> 00:33:16,102
I've been praying to walk again,
as well.

868
00:33:16,187 --> 00:33:18,822
Oh, I don't pray
for you to walk.

869
00:33:18,889 --> 00:33:21,274
I ask God to help you accept
whatever your journey may be.

870
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:24,945
I appreciate your prayers--
I do--

871
00:33:25,029 --> 00:33:26,997
but when you're done praying,

872
00:33:27,064 --> 00:33:29,732
you get to get up off your knees
and walk away.

873
00:33:33,337 --> 00:33:34,788
Sorry.

874
00:33:34,872 --> 00:33:36,873
Self-obsessed bitch.

875
00:33:36,924 --> 00:33:38,208
It's cool.

876
00:33:41,262 --> 00:33:43,246
You know what...

877
00:33:43,297 --> 00:33:44,931
you're really inspiring.

878
00:33:45,016 --> 00:33:47,217
And I feel like you've
been inspiring to a

879
00:33:47,268 --> 00:33:48,635
few other people I know.

880
00:33:48,719 --> 00:33:50,053
What are you doing after school
today?

881
00:33:50,104 --> 00:33:51,471
(whistle blows)

882
00:33:51,555 --> 00:33:54,190
All right, fair warning:
in the glorious history of

883
00:33:54,258 --> 00:33:56,192
Booty Camp,
this will be the toughest!

884
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,811
But first, Quinn's
got the floor.

885
00:33:57,895 --> 00:33:59,562
I invited a friend to join us.

886
00:33:59,613 --> 00:34:01,197
You met him on Valentine's Day.

887
00:34:01,265 --> 00:34:03,483
Teen Jesus!
QUINN: He's got a killer voice.

888
00:34:03,567 --> 00:34:05,535
Whoo!
Okay, all right.

889
00:34:05,602 --> 00:34:07,270
Welcome to the New Directions.

890
00:34:07,321 --> 00:34:09,322
Hey, dude, you have
a twig in your hair.

891
00:34:09,407 --> 00:34:10,457
No, seriously.

892
00:34:10,541 --> 00:34:13,209
WILL: Okay.
Thanks, bro.

893
00:34:13,277 --> 00:34:15,078
Let's give our undivided
attention to Coach Sue.

894
00:34:16,464 --> 00:34:19,666
First off, please don't ask me
which celebrity is the father

895
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:21,301
of my baby. Please.

896
00:34:21,385 --> 00:34:23,953
I will release that information
once I've finalized my book

897
00:34:24,005 --> 00:34:25,305
and movie deal.

898
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:28,391
Now, it has come to my attention
that I have been a tad

899
00:34:28,459 --> 00:34:31,144
harsh with some of you.

900
00:34:31,228 --> 00:34:33,013
I thought I was being kind.

901
00:34:33,097 --> 00:34:35,515
For instance,
I said absolutely nothing

902
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,851
about the implausible
sexual tension

903
00:34:37,935 --> 00:34:39,986
between Mercedes and the
Kentucky Fried Stripper.

904
00:34:40,071 --> 00:34:43,139
Or the sorry fact that you
wasted untold millions

905
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:46,159
on a laser show for yourselves
just so Sandbags could dance

906
00:34:46,243 --> 00:34:48,194
with the night school's
Polynesian janitor.

907
00:34:48,279 --> 00:34:49,829
Actually, he was
Puerto Rican.

908
00:34:49,914 --> 00:34:53,033
Kids, it's in my DNA
to be intense, okay,

909
00:34:53,117 --> 00:34:56,002
just like it's in Porcelain's
DNA to poop rainbow glitter.

910
00:34:56,087 --> 00:34:58,755
Now, I'll admit
I-I behaved badly.

911
00:34:58,822 --> 00:35:00,590
I also realized something.

912
00:35:00,657 --> 00:35:03,877
I am here
for two very important reasons.

913
00:35:03,961 --> 00:35:06,329
Number one: Mr. Schuester needs
at least one adult friend.

914
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,098
And number two:

915
00:35:08,165 --> 00:35:12,685
I am hoping that the miraculous
life growing inside of me

916
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:17,057
can soak up some of your
constantly annoying,

917
00:35:17,141 --> 00:35:21,861
though admittedly laudable,
optimism and decency.

918
00:35:25,699 --> 00:35:27,150
Now, I promise to be nicer

919
00:35:27,201 --> 00:35:30,236
if you promise to work your
talented little butts off

920
00:35:30,321 --> 00:35:32,705
until they hand you that
first-place trophy in Chicago.

921
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:34,657
All right, sloppy babies,

922
00:35:34,708 --> 00:35:37,160
let's take it from the top.

923
00:35:37,211 --> 00:35:39,162
Five, six, seven, eight!

924
00:35:39,213 --> 00:35:40,196
(whistle blows)
(bell ringing)

925
00:35:40,247 --> 00:35:42,365
Hello.

926
00:35:42,416 --> 00:35:44,751
I'm Margaret Thatcher Dog.

927
00:35:44,835 --> 00:35:47,637
My relationship with
the Queen was ruff!

928
00:35:47,704 --> 00:35:48,972
(chuckling)

929
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:50,807
Oh, look what Finn won
you playing skeeball.

930
00:35:50,874 --> 00:35:52,375
Finn won this?

931
00:35:52,426 --> 00:35:54,344
Yeah. Well, Rachel kept making
him win stuffed animals for her,

932
00:35:54,395 --> 00:35:56,646
and at the end of the
day, out of the 14

933
00:35:56,713 --> 00:36:00,016
she had, I confiscated this
little guy to give to you.

934
00:36:00,067 --> 00:36:02,268
Since there
was no convincing
you coming with us.

935
00:36:02,353 --> 00:36:04,737
I would've just
brought you guys down.

936
00:36:04,822 --> 00:36:08,108
Look, I get it:
family stuff is hard,

937
00:36:08,192 --> 00:36:09,492
especially between brothers.

938
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,945
I mean, Finn and I
are not even real brothers,

939
00:36:12,029 --> 00:36:13,863
and we pretty much
disagree on everything,

940
00:36:13,914 --> 00:36:15,731
but I love the big lug.

941
00:36:15,783 --> 00:36:19,252
And at the end of the day,
we're in each other's corners.

942
00:36:19,336 --> 00:36:21,171
You only get one
brother, Blaine.

943
00:36:21,238 --> 00:36:22,288
Don't give up on that.

944
00:36:22,373 --> 00:36:23,623
He's the one that's leaving.

945
00:36:23,707 --> 00:36:25,074
Huge audition,
you didn't hear about it?

946
00:36:25,126 --> 00:36:26,909
Actually, he hasn't left yet.

947
00:36:26,961 --> 00:36:28,845
He's in the auditorium,

948
00:36:28,912 --> 00:36:30,413
hoping that you'll come
and talk to him.

949
00:36:30,464 --> 00:36:32,348
I've tried talking to him.

950
00:36:32,416 --> 00:36:34,250
Doesn't... doesn't really
work with him.

951
00:36:34,301 --> 00:36:36,719
Maybe talking is not the answer.

952
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:38,721
Maybe you need
to show him

953
00:36:38,772 --> 00:36:43,059
how you really feel in the best,
most honest way you know how.

(song ends)

999
00:39:21,552 --> 00:39:23,753
Best you've
ever sounded.

1000
00:39:23,804 --> 00:39:26,189
I am tough on you.

1001
00:39:26,256 --> 00:39:29,525
This week, maybe, a little
tougher than I should've been,

1002
00:39:29,593 --> 00:39:31,794
and I need to apologize
for that.

1003
00:39:31,862 --> 00:39:35,448
But it's only because I see--

1004
00:39:35,532 --> 00:39:37,283
I've always seen--

1005
00:39:37,368 --> 00:39:40,203
how insanely talented you are.

1006
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:43,239
I want you to be as successful
as you can be, Blaine,

1007
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:44,240
and you will be.

1008
00:39:44,291 --> 00:39:45,458
You're gonna do it all--

1009
00:39:45,542 --> 00:39:49,579
movies, concerts...
Broadway.

1010
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:51,714
Even though it's dead?

1011
00:39:51,782 --> 00:39:53,216
You'll resurrect it.

1012
00:39:53,283 --> 00:39:55,718
And when I'm in the audience,
watching you,

1013
00:39:55,786 --> 00:39:58,120
I want to be able to say,
"That's my kid brother up there.

1014
00:39:58,172 --> 00:40:00,556
I helped him get there."

1015
00:40:00,624 --> 00:40:02,175
Thanks for saying that, Coop.

1016
00:40:02,259 --> 00:40:05,144
And I know you really
mean it, too, because

1017
00:40:05,229 --> 00:40:08,014
you weren't pointing
your finger at me or...
Okay, okay.

1018
00:40:08,098 --> 00:40:11,434
(shouting): speaking
really loudly

1019
00:40:11,485 --> 00:40:13,102
(laughing)
to be intense.

1020
00:40:13,153 --> 00:40:15,772
I'm really glad we
could sing together

1021
00:40:15,823 --> 00:40:17,640
one last time
before you left

1022
00:40:17,691 --> 00:40:18,908
to be Mr. Hollywood.

1023
00:40:18,975 --> 00:40:21,577
Actually, my audition
got canceled.

1024
00:40:21,645 --> 00:40:24,864
What?
I don't know.
Apparently, Michael Bay

1025
00:40:24,948 --> 00:40:27,149
just decided to go
in a different direction,

1026
00:40:27,201 --> 00:40:28,868
which is industry-speak

1027
00:40:28,952 --> 00:40:30,286
for "Thanks, but we found

1028
00:40:30,337 --> 00:40:32,171
somebody who's better
and/or hotter."

1029
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:34,257
Okay, first of all,
y-you don't know that.

1030
00:40:34,324 --> 00:40:38,010
And second of all,
screw Optimus Prime.

1031
00:40:38,095 --> 00:40:40,546
Even though we don't live
in the same town,

1032
00:40:40,631 --> 00:40:43,833
and we don't see
each other all the time,

1033
00:40:43,884 --> 00:40:45,668
we're not just
brothers, right?

1034
00:40:48,055 --> 00:40:50,106
We're friends, too?

1035
00:40:50,174 --> 00:40:55,194
That's... exactly what I've
always wanted us to be, Coop.

1036
00:41:00,734 --> 00:41:02,685
Hold on a second.
I just, uh,

1037
00:41:02,736 --> 00:41:04,687
I want to remember
this emotion

1038
00:41:04,738 --> 00:41:07,039
so I can use it
in a scene someday.

1039
00:41:07,124 --> 00:41:08,040
You are ridiculous.

1040
00:41:08,125 --> 00:41:09,792
You never know, right?

1041
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,794
Hey, I want to,
I want to help you.

1042
00:41:11,862 --> 00:41:13,296
I don't want you
to give up on this audition.

1043
00:41:13,363 --> 00:41:15,248
Come on, I got an idea.
Where are we going?

1044
00:41:15,332 --> 00:41:19,201
We are going to put you on tape
so Michael Bay can see

1045
00:41:19,253 --> 00:41:21,087
what real acting is.

1046
00:41:21,171 --> 00:41:22,088
Pointing.

1047
00:41:22,172 --> 00:41:23,172
Nice touch.

1048
00:41:23,223 --> 00:41:25,308
See, I believe that.

1049
00:41:25,375 --> 00:41:27,059
That's why it's
lesson number one.

1050
00:41:27,144 --> 00:41:28,644
(bell ringing)
Hey.

1051
00:41:28,712 --> 00:41:30,680
So how do you think I did
in Cooper's Master class?

1052
00:41:30,731 --> 00:41:34,383
You made it seem like you
discover dead bodies every day.

1053
00:41:34,435 --> 00:41:36,452
If that was a real part,
you would've got it.

1054
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,771
(sighs) So the NYADA scout
is gonna be hereoon.

1055
00:41:38,856 --> 00:41:41,607
I'm pretty sure
I'm ready for it.

1056
00:41:41,692 --> 00:41:45,027
Have you ever thought about
what I'm gonna do in New York?

1057
00:41:45,078 --> 00:41:48,397
Well, one thing I know
is for certain is, we'll
figure it out together.

1058
00:41:48,449 --> 00:41:49,916
Well, that's really nice,

1059
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,869
but I... I feel like I need
to start thinking seriously

1060
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,620
about what's next for me.

1061
00:41:54,705 --> 00:41:56,071
You ever thought
about California?

1062
00:41:56,123 --> 00:41:57,406
I just, I feel
like there's,

1063
00:41:57,458 --> 00:41:59,792
there's so many more
opportunities for me there.

1064
00:41:59,877 --> 00:42:03,346
And Puck, he's got this
really great pool-cleaning
business opportunity.

1065
00:42:03,413 --> 00:42:05,348
And you could audition
for your actor jobs

1066
00:42:05,415 --> 00:42:07,934
and you wouldn't even have
to worry about money,

1067
00:42:08,018 --> 00:42:09,585
because I'd be able
to support you

1068
00:42:09,636 --> 00:42:11,687
you know, as... as
your husband and...
Finn...

1069
00:42:11,755 --> 00:42:13,589
what are you doing?

1070
00:42:13,657 --> 00:42:15,107
Well, I'm thinking
about my future.

1071
00:42:15,192 --> 00:42:18,027
I thought it was our future.

1072
00:42:18,094 --> 00:42:19,479
Of course. Of course, it is

1073
00:42:19,563 --> 00:42:20,780
our future,
And...

1074
00:42:20,864 --> 00:42:22,398
but it feels like

1075
00:42:22,449 --> 00:42:24,283
the conversation's
been a little...

1076
00:42:24,368 --> 00:42:25,651
one-sided lately.

1077
00:42:27,287 --> 00:42:28,955
Look, even Blaine's
brother said

1078
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:30,573
you know, Hollywood is where
you want to go
No, I'm not...

1079
00:42:30,624 --> 00:42:31,941
if you want
to be famous
I'm not...

1080
00:42:31,992 --> 00:42:34,377
as an actress.
a Hollywood
actress, okay?

1081
00:42:34,444 --> 00:42:36,712
In New York, New York
is about the work that you do

1082
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:38,714
and not the work
that you've had done.

1083
00:42:38,782 --> 00:42:41,000
There's no other option
here for me, okay?

1084
00:42:41,084 --> 00:42:42,134
I am Broadway bound.
Right,

1085
00:42:42,219 --> 00:42:43,803
but if I'm going to
be your husband,

1086
00:42:43,887 --> 00:42:45,221
shouldn't I have
something to say
about it, too?
"If"?

1087
00:42:45,288 --> 00:42:47,056
Just seems like you don't
care about my dreams.

1088
00:42:47,123 --> 00:42:48,007
I care.
Of course I care.

1089
00:42:48,091 --> 00:42:49,392
Right, of course you care

1090
00:42:49,459 --> 00:42:51,060
as long as they don't
interfere with yours.

1091
00:42:51,127 --> 00:42:52,595
Look, I need to
be in New York,

1092
00:42:52,646 --> 00:42:53,829
and I need you with me.

1093
00:42:53,897 --> 00:42:56,599
I can't do this without you.

1094
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:59,602
I just want you
to be really sure.

1095
00:42:59,653 --> 00:43:01,237
I just want you to
be really sure

1096
00:43:01,304 --> 00:43:02,471
that you're in
love with me

1097
00:43:02,523 --> 00:43:03,856
and not who you
want me to be.
