1
00:00:00,538 --> 00:00:01,902
<i>So here's what you missed
on Glee.</i>

2
00:00:01,933 --> 00:00:03,410
<i>Rachel went to LA to audition</i>
<i>for a TV show,</i>

3
00:00:03,422 --> 00:00:04,434
<i>but it was terrible and she</i>
<i>missed her performance,</i>

4
00:00:04,468 --> 00:00:06,228
<i>but then she found out</i>
<i>that the TV executives</i>

5
00:00:06,237 --> 00:00:07,771
<i>want to write a TV show</i>
<i>around her.</i>

6
00:00:07,805 --> 00:00:09,739
<i>Sam's a male model and</i>
<i>Mercedes' album's about to drop</i>

7
00:00:09,774 --> 00:00:11,074
<i>and they're still going out,</i>
<i>except Mercedes definitely</i>

8
00:00:11,108 --> 00:00:12,575
<i>wants to save herself</i>
<i>for marriage.</i>

9
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:14,444
<i>Sassy heiress June Dolloway</i>
<i>wants to put on a showcase</i>

10
00:00:14,478 --> 00:00:16,980
<i>for Blaine, but Blaine lied to</i>
<i>Kurt and said he's in it, too.</i>

11
00:00:17,014 --> 00:00:18,974
<i>And that's what you missed</i>
<i>on</i> Glee!

12
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,188
- Uh, there. - Oh, no, huge audition
this week for Treasure Trailz.

13
00:00:27,223 --> 00:00:30,291
They're kind of, like, on the
forefront of the manscaping movement.

14
00:00:30,326 --> 00:00:32,761
I mean, they're going all out:

15
00:00:32,795 --> 00:00:35,163
billboards, print, bus ads.

16
00:00:35,197 --> 00:00:38,433
Okay, my dream of being
almost naked on a public bus

17
00:00:38,467 --> 00:00:40,301
is this close to coming true.

18
00:00:40,336 --> 00:00:43,738
Well, you know, I'm gonna be
spray-painting "mine"

19
00:00:43,773 --> 00:00:45,173
Ooh.
Over all those ads.

20
00:00:45,207 --> 00:00:48,043
Because if I'm gonna be
out of town on this mall tour,

21
00:00:48,077 --> 00:00:50,178
I'm gonna need those 'rexy
models you're working with

22
00:00:50,212 --> 00:00:52,614
to know that you have
a girl, and she fights...

23
00:00:52,648 --> 00:00:53,982
- Dirty.
- Dirty.

24
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:56,584
See? This is exactly what
my show needs to be about.

25
00:00:56,619 --> 00:00:58,887
Old friends struggling
to make it in this world.

26
00:00:58,921 --> 00:01:00,522
ARTIE: Is it normal
for a network to send

27
00:01:00,556 --> 00:01:02,857
a writer to hang out with
the star to figure out the show?

28
00:01:02,892 --> 00:01:04,759
Only when their star's
incredibly interesting.

29
00:01:04,794 --> 00:01:06,394
Mary Halloran is a genius.

30
00:01:06,429 --> 00:01:08,797
She sold her first script
when she was 14 years old.

31
00:01:08,831 --> 00:01:10,131
KURT:
Yeah, I just don't like

32
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:11,700
the idea of someone crashing
Monday night dinner.

33
00:01:11,734 --> 00:01:14,336
No, but the point is for her
to really see my life

34
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,838
and understand my essence,
and you guys are so much about

35
00:01:16,872 --> 00:01:18,907
besides my work,
my talent and my ambition, so...

36
00:01:18,941 --> 00:01:20,742
(knocking on door) Oh, here she is.
Okay, you guys, be really nice,

37
00:01:20,776 --> 00:01:22,610
'cause I don't want her
to feel alienated.

38
00:01:22,645 --> 00:01:24,946
We got to figure out a way to
invite Mary to our showcase.

39
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:27,782
I mean, Rachel shouldn't be the only one
with a chance for small-screen stardom.

40
00:01:27,817 --> 00:01:29,117
Oh. Totally.

41
00:01:30,152 --> 00:01:31,353
(gasps) Oh, my God!

42
00:01:31,387 --> 00:01:33,288
Brittany, what's happening!

43
00:01:33,322 --> 00:01:34,289
What up, bitches?

44
00:01:34,323 --> 00:01:36,024
What are you doing here?

45
00:01:36,058 --> 00:01:37,192
Look who's here.

46
00:01:37,226 --> 00:01:38,259
Hey!

47
00:01:38,294 --> 00:01:39,427
MERCEDES:
Brittany,

48
00:01:39,462 --> 00:01:41,396
I thought that
you were on Lesbian Island.

49
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,731
No... (scoffs)

50
00:01:42,765 --> 00:01:44,099
I lost my passport and
I was trapped in the airport,

51
00:01:44,133 --> 00:01:45,400
like Tom Hanks in that movie.

52
00:01:45,434 --> 00:01:46,701
- <i>Castaway?</i>
- <i>Big?</i>

53
00:01:46,736 --> 00:01:48,403
- <i>The Money Pit?</i>
- Okay, it was<i> Castaway.</i>

54
00:01:48,437 --> 00:01:50,205
So, where's Santana?

55
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:52,540
Oh, uh, she's shooting
a Yeast-I-Stat commercial

56
00:01:52,575 --> 00:01:54,209
in Iowa for a week.

57
00:01:54,243 --> 00:01:55,777
Apparently, they had the best

58
00:01:55,811 --> 00:01:57,846
wheat fields
to slow-motion-run through.

59
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,314
She didn't call and tell you?

60
00:01:59,348 --> 00:02:01,950
No. I gave up my cell phone
after Kiki and I and broke up.

61
00:02:01,984 --> 00:02:03,084
The pain was too great.

62
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,386
WOMAN:
Hello?

63
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:08,123
Hello? I'm Mary Halloran.

64
00:02:08,157 --> 00:02:09,958
- Yes.
- Oh, is that Chinese food?

65
00:02:09,992 --> 00:02:12,794
Just the smell of it
gives me the Lady Di's.

66
00:02:12,828 --> 00:02:15,096
Oh, I'm s... Hello.
I am Rachel Berry.

67
00:02:15,131 --> 00:02:16,972
It is so nice to meet you.
Let me introduce you

68
00:02:16,999 --> 00:02:18,733
to my friends... Oh,
no, no, don't bother.

69
00:02:18,768 --> 00:02:20,135
I have a thing about names.

70
00:02:20,169 --> 00:02:21,903
Oh.
Jonathan says it's

71
00:02:21,937 --> 00:02:23,138
a form of narcissism,

72
00:02:23,172 --> 00:02:25,473
but I think it's related
to my anxiety disorder.

73
00:02:25,508 --> 00:02:26,748
Ooh, who's-who's Jonathan?

74
00:02:26,776 --> 00:02:28,410
He's my Tuesday-Thursday shrink.

75
00:02:28,444 --> 00:02:30,645
MARY: At least I think
that's his name. You know,

76
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,947
that wonton smell's going
straight to my tummy.

77
00:02:32,982 --> 00:02:35,650
(gasps) Bathroom. Now.
It-It's right there.

78
00:02:35,685 --> 00:02:36,951
Okay.

79
00:02:38,854 --> 00:02:41,589
Oh, I'm really excited
to be working with you,

80
00:02:41,624 --> 00:02:42,824
by the way, Randy.

81
00:02:42,858 --> 00:02:44,392
It's gonna be a blast.

82

83
00:02:49,832 --> 00:02:53,568
Okay, let's start writing!

84
00:02:53,602 --> 00:02:54,669
(chuckles)

85
00:02:54,704 --> 00:02:57,939
"The Untitled Mary Halloran

87
00:02:59,575 --> 00:03:00,608
(quietly):
Yes!

88
00:03:00,643 --> 00:03:02,410
So... (sighs)

89
00:03:02,445 --> 00:03:04,479
tell me about yourself.

90
00:03:04,513 --> 00:03:06,448
Well, let's see, uh,
I-I have two gay dads.

91
00:03:06,482 --> 00:03:07,782
Amazing! (laughs)

92
00:03:07,817 --> 00:03:08,883
We can use that!

93
00:03:08,918 --> 00:03:09,884
Oh, good. Okay.

94
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:11,453
Do they work for NASA?

95
00:03:11,487 --> 00:03:12,654
No, they don't.

96
00:03:12,688 --> 00:03:13,655
Gay...

97
00:03:13,689 --> 00:03:15,023
NASA...

98
00:03:15,057 --> 00:03:16,791
- dads.
- N... Uh...

99
00:03:16,826 --> 00:03:18,193
So, you're a senior?

100
00:03:18,227 --> 00:03:22,197
Um, yes, I-I started out in
my high school glee club, so...

101
00:03:22,231 --> 00:03:23,732
(imitates buzzer) Irrelevant!

102
00:03:23,766 --> 00:03:25,266
We<i> can't</i> use that.

103
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:27,669
Oh. I'm so sorry. The a
capella thing is so over.

104
00:03:27,703 --> 00:03:29,037
But you're on Broadway.

105
00:03:29,071 --> 00:03:29,971
Yeah!

106
00:03:30,006 --> 00:03:31,206
Uh! What's that like?

107
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,842
It's amazing.
Um, I-I do eight shows

108
00:03:33,876 --> 00:03:35,877
a week, so it's a little,
you know, tiring, but...

109
00:03:35,911 --> 00:03:37,145
Lazy.

110
00:03:37,179 --> 00:03:37,912
I'm sorry?

111
00:03:39,181 --> 00:03:40,649
Is this, like, your process?

112
00:03:40,683 --> 00:03:43,752
(like a robot):
Mm! What is Mary-bot's process?

113
00:03:43,786 --> 00:03:45,253
Does not compute.

114
00:03:45,288 --> 00:03:47,589
(imitates alarm):
Meh! Meh! Meh! Meh!

115
00:03:47,623 --> 00:03:48,857
Okay. Um...

116
00:03:48,891 --> 00:03:50,859
so, how-how did you...

117
00:03:50,893 --> 00:03:52,294
start writing?

118
00:03:52,328 --> 00:03:54,696
(sighs) Well, my freshman year

119
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:56,598
at Princeton, I wrote a version

120
00:03:56,632 --> 00:03:58,733
of<i> The Diary of Anne Frank,</i>

121
00:03:58,768 --> 00:04:02,470
where Anne was played by
an upright Oreck vacuum cleaner.

122
00:04:02,505 --> 00:04:04,940
It transferred to New York,
where I won an Obie,

123
00:04:04,974 --> 00:04:07,409
and then I got
a MacArthur Genius Grant.

124
00:04:07,443 --> 00:04:08,877
- Oh, wow.
- Oh!

125
00:04:08,911 --> 00:04:10,946
I'm so bored!
Too much work!

126
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,781
Can I use your bathroom?

127
00:04:12,815 --> 00:04:14,282
I'm not gonna pee.

128
00:04:14,317 --> 00:04:16,551
I'm just gonna snoop
through the cabinets.

129
00:04:16,586 --> 00:04:20,355
But before you say anything,
remember that it's Opposite Day.

130
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:22,524
Yes?

131
00:04:22,558 --> 00:04:24,092
Thank you.

132
00:04:25,285 --> 00:04:27,405
ARTIE: Miss Jones,
here we are with the launch

133
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,230
of your nationwide tour
of shopping malls.

134
00:04:29,265 --> 00:04:32,133
As you look ahead to a summer
of autograph signings

135
00:04:32,168 --> 00:04:34,269
and mall appearances
and glamorous events

136
00:04:34,303 --> 00:04:36,504
at Marriott Hotels
across our great, great country,

137
00:04:36,539 --> 00:04:37,706
how do you feel?

138
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,074
You know, I feel
absolutely amazing.

139
00:04:39,108 --> 00:04:41,076
We're gonna meet up
with Santana in Reno,

140
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:44,112
and I even got the label
to bring along my girl Brittany

141
00:04:44,146 --> 00:04:45,614
as my star backup dancer.

142
00:04:45,648 --> 00:04:47,115
We're gonna be
like Charlie's Angels!

143
00:04:47,149 --> 00:04:48,850
I get to be Farrah...
no arguments.

144
00:04:48,884 --> 00:04:51,419
I'm the Angel that torches
stuff with her laser eyes.

Blaine.

200
00:07:24,273 --> 00:07:25,574
Come.

201
00:07:25,608 --> 00:07:27,943
- I brought BabyCakes.
- Oh.

202
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:32,013
- What were you doing up there?
- Oh, I like

203
00:07:32,048 --> 00:07:34,088
to measure the stage
to see how many paces

204
00:07:34,116 --> 00:07:35,684
I have in each direction...
that way

205
00:07:35,718 --> 00:07:37,519
if I decide to freestyle,

206
00:07:37,553 --> 00:07:39,955
I won't fall on my ass
into the crowd.

207
00:07:39,989 --> 00:07:41,623
Oh.

208
00:07:41,657 --> 00:07:44,292
You know, success depends
on three things.

209
00:07:44,327 --> 00:07:47,729
It depends on talent,
hard work and... luck,

210
00:07:47,763 --> 00:07:50,899
and if you have the first two, you
won't have to worry about the third.

211
00:07:50,933 --> 00:07:52,300
Oh. Who said that?

212
00:07:52,335 --> 00:07:54,269
Me. Just now.

213
00:07:54,303 --> 00:07:55,637
(chuckles) All right.

214
00:07:55,671 --> 00:07:59,207
Should I seat Michael Bay
next to Walter Cronkite?

215
00:07:59,242 --> 00:08:01,943
Uh, I'm pretty sure
Walter Cronkite died.

216
00:08:01,978 --> 00:08:03,345
Oh. That's sad.

217
00:08:03,379 --> 00:08:04,813
It's okay, don't
worry about Walter...

218
00:08:04,847 --> 00:08:07,082
he had a fantastic life.

219
00:08:07,116 --> 00:08:09,251
And he made great Manhattans.

220
00:08:09,285 --> 00:08:11,786
It's not Walter.
It's... it's Kurt.

221
00:08:11,821 --> 00:08:13,555
I've... been
carrying around

222
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:15,724
this lie that he's
gonna be in the showcase.

223
00:08:15,758 --> 00:08:18,393
Can we just give him one song?
Enough.

224
00:08:18,427 --> 00:08:21,830
Blaine, I am putting the most
valuable currency I have

225
00:08:21,864 --> 00:08:25,500
into this event, and that
currency is my reputation.

226
00:08:25,535 --> 00:08:28,770
All the people come here
because I am their taste-maker.

227
00:08:28,805 --> 00:08:30,872
And my palate...

228
00:08:30,907 --> 00:08:33,074
is undeniable when
it comes to talent,

229
00:08:33,109 --> 00:08:36,011
and I cannot jeopardize
my track record because

230
00:08:36,045 --> 00:08:38,146
your friend doesn't
like to hear bad news.

231
00:08:38,181 --> 00:08:41,316
Kurt is amazing.
He's incredible.

232
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:44,085
You take my lead, and
the world will greet you

233
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,154
like Venus in a clamshell.

234
00:08:46,189 --> 00:08:47,489
You cross me,

235
00:08:47,523 --> 00:08:49,124
you will be driftwood.

236
00:08:53,362 --> 00:08:54,496

Well, I brought you lunch,

00:11:09,966 --> 00:11:11,967
but it looks like
you already had dessert.

282
00:11:12,001 --> 00:11:13,268
That was nice.

283
00:11:13,302 --> 00:11:15,262
Are you gonna put that
in the showcase?

284
00:11:15,271 --> 00:11:17,639
June doesn't
want you in the showcase.

285
00:11:17,673 --> 00:11:20,108
And she never did.

286
00:11:22,912 --> 00:11:25,714
So, you've been lying
to me this whole time?

287
00:11:25,748 --> 00:11:26,882
I thought I could convince her,

288
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:28,250
and then they wouldn't
be lies anymore.

289
00:11:28,284 --> 00:11:30,352
I love you.

290
00:11:30,386 --> 00:11:32,421
How am I supposed to believe
that you love me if I can't even

291
00:11:32,455 --> 00:11:33,655
- trust you?
- I did it<i> because</i> I love you.

292
00:11:33,689 --> 00:11:35,657
You lied to me!

293
00:11:35,692 --> 00:11:37,192
We had long conversations
about this.

294
00:11:37,226 --> 00:11:38,326
I didn't know what else to do.

295
00:11:38,361 --> 00:11:39,361
I didn't want
to hurt your feelings.

296
00:11:39,395 --> 00:11:43,131
I... I am...
I am so, so sorry.

297
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:45,000
Yeah, I bet you are.

298
00:11:45,034 --> 00:11:47,636
Too bad I can't believe
in anything else you say.

299
00:11:57,287 --> 00:11:59,254
What is with the rubber band?

300
00:11:59,289 --> 00:12:01,723
Um... (clears throat)

301
00:12:01,758 --> 00:12:03,792
Just, it's been a while since
I've been intimate with a girl,

302
00:12:03,803 --> 00:12:06,471
so I ***

303
00:12:06,496 --> 00:12:08,230
Oh, I know what you mean.
It's been, like,

304
00:12:08,264 --> 00:12:09,965
nine hours since got laid.
I'm going nuts.

305
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:14,946
WOMAN:
All right, cattle kids.

306
00:12:14,971 --> 00:12:16,672
Listen up.
I'm Charlie Darling,

307
00:12:16,706 --> 00:12:18,407
and you're all here
on zero notice

308
00:12:18,441 --> 00:12:22,211
because there's an advertising
crisis over at the...

309
00:12:22,245 --> 00:12:23,645
Treasure Trailz campaign.

310
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,048
Their big model got sent
to prison for running

311
00:12:26,082 --> 00:12:28,116
an underground teacup
dog-fighting ring in Miami.

312
00:12:28,151 --> 00:12:29,618
They have billboards
set to launch

313
00:12:29,652 --> 00:12:31,453
in a few days, so it's time

314
00:12:31,487 --> 00:12:35,123
for a new

315
00:12:35,158 --> 00:12:37,092
We're going to do this
fast, and we're gonna

316
00:12:37,126 --> 00:12:38,260
do it dirty. Walk.

317
00:12:38,294 --> 00:12:39,862
If you can't get into my jeans

318
00:12:39,896 --> 00:12:41,697
with your walk,
then you don't have it.

319
00:12:41,731 --> 00:12:43,332
I brought some girls

320
00:12:43,366 --> 00:12:45,000
to help set the mood.

321
00:12:45,034 --> 00:12:49,004
For the love of God,
please, someone just turn me on.

322
00:12:49,038 --> 00:12:51,106

You... what's your name?

350
00:14:46,856 --> 00:14:48,891
Uh, Sam Evans.

351
00:14:48,925 --> 00:14:51,794
Sam, you are seriously
buzzing with sex.

352
00:14:51,828 --> 00:14:54,396
Uh, maybe it's just
'cause I'm a little backed up.

353
00:14:54,431 --> 00:14:56,265
My, uh, girlfriend and I...

354
00:14:56,299 --> 00:14:58,200
we're waiting
till we get married.

355
00:14:58,234 --> 00:15:00,235
Whatever it is, it's working.

356
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:02,565
Come back tonight for the shoot.

357
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,235
Everything about you just
screams Treasure Trailz.

358
00:15:12,643 --> 00:15:14,377
What's this?

359
00:15:14,412 --> 00:15:16,613
We need to have
a little girl talk.

360
00:15:16,647 --> 00:15:17,847
KURT:
It's about Sam.

361
00:15:17,882 --> 00:15:20,950
Are you gonna break up with him
before you go on tour?

362
00:15:20,985 --> 00:15:23,486
Sam, I think you need to
break it off with Mercedes.

363
00:15:23,521 --> 00:15:25,121
It's just the
gentlemanly thing to do.

364
00:15:25,156 --> 00:15:27,023
(whirring) We love each other.

365
00:15:27,058 --> 00:15:28,658
You're going to be traveling
all over the country,

366
00:15:28,693 --> 00:15:29,793
meeting tons of people.

367
00:15:29,827 --> 00:15:30,860
Guys are gonna be, like,

368
00:15:30,895 --> 00:15:31,928
throwing themselves at you.

369
00:15:31,962 --> 00:15:33,697
Listen, I've got my posse

370
00:15:33,731 --> 00:15:35,165
and my Jesus.

371
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,599
I can resist temptation!

372
00:15:36,634 --> 00:15:37,901
But Sam can't.

373
00:15:37,935 --> 00:15:39,769
Sam is cool with the whole

374
00:15:39,804 --> 00:15:41,037
waiting until marriage thing.

375
00:15:41,072 --> 00:15:43,206
He barely even thinks
about it anymore.

376
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,974
It's all I think about.

377
00:15:45,009 --> 00:15:47,410
Like today, there were
all these boobs all around me,

378
00:15:47,445 --> 00:15:49,612
and I almost passed out...
but I didn't.

379
00:15:49,647 --> 00:15:51,381
I controlled it.

380
00:15:51,415 --> 00:15:52,782
Okay, I'm not gonna lie.

381
00:15:52,817 --> 00:15:55,585
It is scary, worrying about what
the person you love is doing

382
00:15:55,619 --> 00:15:56,987
while you're
a million miles away,

383
00:15:57,021 --> 00:15:58,154
but it's worth the risk.

384
00:15:58,189 --> 00:16:00,423
And Sam respects me.

385
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:03,226
And if that makes me a romantic
and not a realist,

386
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:06,062
well, that's the way that
I'm choosing to live my life.

387
00:16:06,097 --> 00:16:09,032
Look, guys,
I'm committed to Mercedes, okay?

388
00:16:09,066 --> 00:16:11,301
She's the one.
I'm not gonna screw it up.

389
00:16:11,335 --> 00:16:12,402
RACHEL:
Look, being in love

390
00:16:12,436 --> 00:16:14,838
is amazing,
and when you have it,

391
00:16:14,872 --> 00:16:16,773
it's terrifying to let it go,

392
00:16:16,807 --> 00:16:19,175
but sometimes the best chance
you have of staying together

393
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:20,944
is by being apart for a while.

394
00:16:23,981 --> 00:16:26,483
Ow.

395
00:16:26,517 --> 00:16:29,786
Rachel's one of those people
that, when she sets a goal,

396
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,621
she doesn't stop
until she gets it.

397
00:16:31,656 --> 00:16:33,823
I've never met anyone...

398
00:16:34,859 --> 00:16:37,027
Did you just put
a donut in your bra?

399
00:16:37,061 --> 00:16:39,429
Maybe?

400
00:16:39,463 --> 00:16:41,031
(laughs)

401
00:16:41,065 --> 00:16:43,033
Did you want this one?

402
00:16:44,402 --> 00:16:45,869
(typing)

403
00:16:45,903 --> 00:16:47,904
So, are we gonna begin, or...?

404
00:16:48,906 --> 00:16:51,074
I love your attitude,

405
00:16:51,108 --> 00:16:53,076
and I'm okay with your loafers.

406
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:55,278
We're gonna have
to change your name, though.

407
00:16:55,313 --> 00:16:58,114
Do you prefer Slaine or Fane?

408
00:16:58,149 --> 00:17:00,917
I'm sorry.
Are you an actual writer

409
00:17:00,952 --> 00:17:03,019
from a real-life
television network?

410
00:17:03,054 --> 00:17:05,388
Shoop shoop!
Shoop shoop da-doop!

411
00:17:05,423 --> 00:17:08,925
Can I just say that you are
a breath of fresh air,

412
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,394
and I love your pajamas?

413
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:13,430
Don't steal my pajamas!

414
00:17:13,464 --> 00:17:15,498
Little mousies
live in the pockets!

415
00:17:15,533 --> 00:17:16,900
Amazing.

416
00:17:16,934 --> 00:17:18,902
(laughs) All right.

417
00:17:18,936 --> 00:17:21,137
And a kitty lives in my pants.

418
00:17:21,172 --> 00:17:22,505
(laughs)

419
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,675
Rachel, that chick is insane.

420
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,377
I think she's amazing.
When Mary and I spoke

421
00:17:27,411 --> 00:17:30,046
telepathically, I told her
I'd watch any show she created.

422
00:17:30,081 --> 00:17:32,248
If you go out for that TV
show, you're going to have

423
00:17:32,283 --> 00:17:33,583
to burn a lot of bridges.

424
00:17:33,618 --> 00:17:35,385
Sidney Greene even said
he's gonna blackball you

425
00:17:35,419 --> 00:17:37,187
if you missed another
performance. What is he gonna do

426
00:17:37,221 --> 00:17:38,822
when he finds out
you're quitting on him?

427
00:17:38,823 --> 00:17:41,324
Shh! Look, if I do this TV show,
then I can, like,

428
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:43,793
come back to New York afterwards
and do any show I want

429
00:17:43,828 --> 00:17:45,429
for, like, ten times
the amount of money.

430
00:17:45,463 --> 00:17:47,697
Understood,
but if you're making that bet,

431
00:17:47,732 --> 00:17:49,432
I wish you'd bet on your voice,

432
00:17:49,467 --> 00:17:51,868
not some crazy psychopath
who eats couch cushions.

433
00:17:51,902 --> 00:17:53,570
The armrest is
the sweetest meat.

434
00:17:53,604 --> 00:17:55,772
Look, you're the star
of the show,

435
00:17:55,806 --> 00:17:57,073
but you have to trust

436
00:17:57,108 --> 00:17:59,709
your instincts, not hers.

437
00:17:59,744 --> 00:18:02,412
Okay, you guys, welcome to
the first informal read-through

438
00:18:02,446 --> 00:18:05,515
of the<i> Untitled</i>
<i>Mary Halloran Project.</i>

439
00:18:05,549 --> 00:18:07,550
So, I will be playing
the role of Rachel.

440
00:18:07,585 --> 00:18:09,185
Blaine, you'll be
playing Slaine,

441
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,954
and Brittany, you'll be
playing Nittany. (whoops)

442
00:18:10,988 --> 00:18:12,856
I'm guessing I'm Jam?

443
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,424
- Blartie?
- Yes.

444
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:16,893
Cert? I'm Cert,
like the breath mint.

445
00:18:16,928 --> 00:18:18,128
Let's start with scene one.

446
00:18:18,162 --> 00:18:20,430
Interior Cert
and Rachel's apartment.

447
00:18:20,464 --> 00:18:23,533
"Rachel eats a full sheet cake
in a bathtub,

448
00:18:23,568 --> 00:18:26,069
thinking about her gay dads
who work for NASA."

449
00:18:26,103 --> 00:18:27,537
Um...

450
00:18:27,572 --> 00:18:28,939
Hey.

451
00:18:28,973 --> 00:18:30,273
Hey, where did you get
that dinosaur suit?

452
00:18:30,308 --> 00:18:33,343
I found it in a Dumpster
in the Bronx, so I put it on,

453
00:18:33,377 --> 00:18:36,379
but then I was afraid it might
have lice, so I took it off,

454
00:18:36,414 --> 00:18:38,548
but then I missed having it on,
so I put it back on.

455
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:41,184
O-M-G-R-O-F-L-W-T-H.

456
00:18:41,218 --> 00:18:44,220
My stupid gay NASA dads forgot
that today was my birthday,

457
00:18:44,255 --> 00:18:46,575
and I know that they're on the
International Space Station,

458
00:18:46,591 --> 00:18:48,625
but I, like, never even
forget their anniversary.

459
00:18:48,659 --> 00:18:50,493
Hashtag D-B-E-Y-R.

460
00:18:50,528 --> 00:18:53,396
Hashtag D-I-L-L-I-G-A-S.

461
00:18:53,431 --> 00:18:54,631
Hashtag, hashtag...

462
00:18:54,665 --> 00:18:55,732
BOTH:

hashtag..."
hashtag, hashtag."

466
00:19:00,638 --> 00:19:02,405
Why don't we move
to, uh, scene 12?

467
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,341
(exhales loudly)
That was weird.

468
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:06,042
That was<i> uber</i> weird.

469
00:19:06,077 --> 00:19:08,712
It is so wrong that we just
slept together. Uber wrong.

470
00:19:08,746 --> 00:19:10,113
I'm gay, and you're
mostly lesbian,

471
00:19:10,147 --> 00:19:11,348
but here's what I'm thinking.

472
00:19:11,382 --> 00:19:13,016
I know what
you're going to say.

473
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:16,419
Okay, let's just say it at the
same time at the count of three.

474
00:19:16,454 --> 00:19:17,988
One, two, three.

475
00:19:18,022 --> 00:19:19,289
BOTH:
Let's keep sleeping together

476
00:19:19,323 --> 00:19:20,423
and start an art gallery

477
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:21,958
in the performance space
downstairs!

478
00:19:21,993 --> 00:19:23,326
- Oh. Mmm.
- Mmm.

479
00:19:23,361 --> 00:19:24,261
Um...

480
00:19:24,295 --> 00:19:26,162
Okay, well, why...

481
00:19:26,197 --> 00:19:27,464
why don't we, uh,

482
00:19:27,498 --> 00:19:31,268
move onto... Rachel's
impromptu birthday rave?

483
00:19:31,302 --> 00:19:33,336
(dance music playing)

484
00:19:33,371 --> 00:19:35,038
What's going on?

485
00:19:35,072 --> 00:19:37,007
It's a rave. Coffee rave!

486
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:38,608
What?
It's a coffee rave!

487
00:19:38,643 --> 00:19:39,876
Everybody's drinking coffee.

488
00:19:39,911 --> 00:19:42,445
Why coffee?
I don't know.

489
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,147
No one's here.

490
00:19:44,181 --> 00:19:45,615
It's the worst
coffee rave ever.

491
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:46,850
It's for Rachel!

492
00:19:46,884 --> 00:19:48,652
Her gay astronaut dads
forgot her birthday.

493
00:19:48,686 --> 00:19:51,054
She sort of has an issue with
people forgetting birthdays.

494
00:19:51,088 --> 00:19:53,189
For a while, she went
to therapy about it.

495
00:19:53,224 --> 00:19:55,458
I'm-I'm sorry. Can we stop?

496
00:19:55,493 --> 00:19:57,794
The speech goes on
for, like, six more pages.

497
00:19:57,828 --> 00:19:59,729
I don't even see
any punctuation.

498
00:19:59,764 --> 00:20:02,365
Everyone keeps stopping just
when I start getting into it.

499
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,700
This doesn't make any sense.

500
00:20:03,734 --> 00:20:05,035
Yeah, I sort of called that.

501
00:20:05,069 --> 00:20:06,636
ARTIE: Girl, you're gonna have
to do something.

502
00:20:06,671 --> 00:20:09,639
You're right,
and Kurt was right, too.

503
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,108
If I'm going to do this,

504
00:20:12,143 --> 00:20:15,212
it's going to be my show,
or no show at all.

505
00:20:18,352 --> 00:20:20,319
(pigeons cooing)

506
00:20:22,823 --> 00:20:25,324
They're full of diseases.

507
00:20:26,626 --> 00:20:29,106
Pretty hard to dance at your
showcase with bumblefoot.

508
00:20:30,697 --> 00:20:32,531
Humans can't get bumblefoot.

509
00:20:34,835 --> 00:20:37,269
And I don't want
to do the showcase anymore.

510
00:20:37,304 --> 00:20:41,040
You are more important
to me than anything.

511
00:20:43,134 --> 00:20:45,654
What do you think it's like
to fly for the first time?

512
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,747
I mean, here you are
up in this nest,

513
00:20:47,781 --> 00:20:49,315
which is the only
home you've ever known,

514
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:52,251
and even though your DNA and
millions of years of evolution

515
00:20:52,285 --> 00:20:54,120
are telling you
that if you jump,

516
00:20:54,154 --> 00:20:56,022
you won't hit the
ground like a stone,

517
00:20:56,056 --> 00:20:58,157
you can never really know.

518
00:20:58,191 --> 00:21:00,826
Relationships are like that.

519
00:21:00,861 --> 00:21:04,096
You give someone your
heart to look after,

520
00:21:04,131 --> 00:21:07,266
and you tell yourself
that you're safe, but...

521
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,901
you never know if
today or tomorrow

522
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:11,637
is going to be the day that
they drop it like a stone.

523
00:21:11,672 --> 00:21:13,673
Kurt, I'm really,
really, really sorry.

524
00:21:13,707 --> 00:21:15,274
I get what happened.

525
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:18,210
The way that I was talking
about the showcase...

526
00:21:18,245 --> 00:21:20,780
there's no way that I would have
been cool with not being in it.

527
00:21:20,814 --> 00:21:22,181
I would have lied to me, too.

528
00:21:22,215 --> 00:21:23,416
I don't understand.

529
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,784
If you're not mad at me,

530
00:21:24,818 --> 00:21:26,419
then where are you going
with all this flying stuff?

531
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:28,554
Oh, no, I-I was mad.

532
00:21:28,588 --> 00:21:33,693
Then I realized that
trust is a choice.

533
00:21:35,095 --> 00:21:37,663
You know, every day, we're
going to roll out of bed,

534
00:21:37,698 --> 00:21:39,398
and send each other
into the world,

535
00:21:39,433 --> 00:21:42,301
just trusting that we
have each other's backs.

536
00:21:42,336 --> 00:21:45,638
And we will slip up,
and-and we will be scared,

537
00:21:45,672 --> 00:21:48,107
but I choose to trust

538
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:50,910
and to love you
through everything.

539
00:21:51,945 --> 00:21:54,080
Thank you.

540
00:21:54,114 --> 00:21:56,749
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

541
00:21:56,783 --> 00:21:58,551
Uh, I love you so much.

542
00:21:58,585 --> 00:22:00,286
I-I mean what I said
about the showcase.

543
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,388
Either we fly together,
or we don't fly at all.

544
00:22:02,422 --> 00:22:04,423
I am very happy for you.

545
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:06,592
And I'm very excited
the world gets

546
00:22:06,626 --> 00:22:07,826
to see you spread your wings.

547
00:22:08,996 --> 00:22:10,396
Now it's your turn to fly.

548
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:11,564
Thank you.

549
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:16,335
I don't know if it's all
this bird talk, but...

550
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:17,837
I'm getting a little turned on.

551
00:22:17,871 --> 00:22:19,305
Let's go inside.

552
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:22,074
Hey, hey, hey.

553
00:22:22,109 --> 00:22:24,410
I'm the luckiest guy
in the world.

554
00:22:24,444 --> 00:22:26,445
Yeah, pretty much.

555
00:22:28,112 --> 00:22:30,592
RACHEL: You know, we have,
uh, plain donuts here.

556
00:22:30,617 --> 00:22:32,918
I prefer the misery
of doing it this way,

557
00:22:32,953 --> 00:22:34,387
earning it.

558
00:22:34,421 --> 00:22:36,589
Yeah, see, that's sort of
what I mean about the show.

559
00:22:36,623 --> 00:22:38,891
You know, which is
genius, by the way.

560
00:22:38,925 --> 00:22:40,760
(chuckling):
Thank you.

561
00:22:40,794 --> 00:22:42,261
I just think the
character of Rachel

562
00:22:42,295 --> 00:22:43,396
doesn't really sound like me.

563
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:45,331
She... sounds like you.

564
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:47,667
I know TV.

565
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:49,835
People want antiheroes.

566
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,971
They want chubby girls
who can't keep men

567
00:22:52,005 --> 00:22:53,639
and men who kill people.

568
00:22:53,674 --> 00:22:55,641
And that's great. I just...
I thought that Mr. Paulblatt

569
00:22:55,676 --> 00:22:57,376
wanted to make a show
that was about me.

570
00:22:57,411 --> 00:22:59,451
I know the kinds of shows
he greenlights...

571
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:02,581
they all have the one thing
you lack: irony.

572
00:23:02,616 --> 00:23:05,751
When I was in the glee club
and I had to explain something,

573
00:23:05,786 --> 00:23:08,120
it always helped me
to do it through song.

574
00:23:10,857 --> 00:23:12,825
Oh... God, no.

575
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:14,694
I just want
to show you my essence.

576
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:16,362
I don't know
how to write a script,

577
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:18,631
but I know
how I want it to feel.

578
00:23:18,665 --> 00:23:22,201

(cheering and applause)

609
00:25:44,077 --> 00:25:45,645
This is so weird.

610
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,314
I was watching you and I was
like, "What is this feeling?"

611
00:25:48,348 --> 00:25:49,982
Right? It's so unfamiliar.

612
00:25:50,017 --> 00:25:51,584
What was it?

613
00:25:51,618 --> 00:25:53,586
I think it was happy.

614
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,588
That's never happened
to me before.

615
00:25:55,622 --> 00:25:56,689
(sighs)

616
00:25:56,723 --> 00:25:58,090
I think you're right.

617
00:25:58,125 --> 00:26:00,693
Maybe there is a show in making
people not hate themselves.

618
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:01,961
You mean it?

619
00:26:01,995 --> 00:26:04,297
A-And, you know,
you'll make her sound like me?

620
00:26:04,331 --> 00:26:07,366
Well, they'll never make it, but
I'll give your version a shot.

621
00:26:07,401 --> 00:26:08,834
Oh, my God. Thank you so much.

622
00:26:08,869 --> 00:26:10,469
Okay, I'm gonna give you
a hug now.

623
00:26:10,504 --> 00:26:11,737
Oh. Wow.

624
00:26:12,656 --> 00:26:14,616
Now can you leave?
I need to shame-eat.

625
00:26:14,641 --> 00:26:16,842
Oh. Yeah. Okay.

626
00:26:16,877 --> 00:26:18,878
(shudders)

627
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,235
Okay, good. Yeah, just... Yeah.

628
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:25,837
Give me a little more sex,
a little more sex.

629
00:26:25,871 --> 00:26:26,838
A little more heat. Come on.

630
00:26:26,872 --> 00:26:28,373
Chocolate.
Banana.

631
00:26:28,407 --> 00:26:30,075
Give it to me, give it to me.
Just tighten the abs

632
00:26:30,109 --> 00:26:32,544
a little bit. There you go.
Just look over this way.

633
00:26:32,578 --> 00:26:34,679
No, not all the way. I don't like that.
I don't like that. Ass?

634
00:26:34,714 --> 00:26:36,281
Can you just give me more sex?
You know? Feel it.

635
00:26:36,315 --> 00:26:37,282
Yeah.

636
00:26:38,918 --> 00:26:40,385
This isn't working.

637
00:26:40,419 --> 00:26:41,853
No, I hate everything.
I hate everything.

638
00:26:41,887 --> 00:26:43,855
(sighs)
Sam, where's my sex buzz?

639
00:26:43,889 --> 00:26:45,624
You didn't get laid today,
did you?

640
00:26:45,658 --> 00:26:48,126
No, it's-it's... your...

641
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,261
your assistant is...

642
00:26:50,296 --> 00:26:51,529
looking at me kind of funny.

643
00:26:51,564 --> 00:26:53,431
Is one of your nipples
higher than the other?

644
00:26:53,466 --> 00:26:55,300
It's...
weirding me out.

645
00:26:55,334 --> 00:26:58,270
Okay. Enough, enough.
Everybody out. Out.

646
00:27:03,409 --> 00:27:04,643
(sighs)

647
00:27:04,677 --> 00:27:06,444
(sniffs) Okay.

648
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,949
Do you want a beer?

649
00:27:10,983 --> 00:27:12,984
I'm-I'm... I'm nine-nineteen.

650
00:27:13,019 --> 00:27:15,220
I won't tell your mom.

651
00:27:16,656 --> 00:27:18,356
What are you feeling?

652
00:27:18,391 --> 00:27:21,226
Um...

653
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,795
well, if I was a soup,

654
00:27:23,829 --> 00:27:26,898
I would probably be minestrone.

655
00:27:26,933 --> 00:27:28,233
Keep talking.

656
00:27:28,267 --> 00:27:30,402
I like your honesty.
So does the camera.

657
00:27:30,436 --> 00:27:33,071
Uh...

658
00:27:33,105 --> 00:27:35,473
Well...

659
00:27:35,508 --> 00:27:38,009
you're really hot,
so there's that.

660
00:27:39,045 --> 00:27:41,046
There's definitely that.

661
00:27:42,515 --> 00:27:45,283
But I...

662
00:27:45,318 --> 00:27:46,451
I love my girlfriend.

663
00:27:46,485 --> 00:27:48,445
The one who doesn't have sex
with you?

664
00:27:51,324 --> 00:27:53,758
Um... y...

665
00:27:53,793 --> 00:27:55,760
I-I'm also feeling

666
00:27:55,795 --> 00:27:57,963
kind of scared.

667
00:27:57,997 --> 00:27:59,464
Of me?

668
00:27:59,498 --> 00:28:02,033
Well, it's just that this job
is really important to me.

669
00:28:02,068 --> 00:28:03,935
(stammers)
It's a dream come true.

670
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:05,804
I'm just worried that if I don't
give you what you want

671
00:28:05,838 --> 00:28:07,472
I-I might lose it.

672
00:28:07,506 --> 00:28:08,707
What do you think I want?

673
00:28:09,742 --> 00:28:11,042
Hmm?

674
00:28:12,345 --> 00:28:14,145
I'm gonna tell you something

675
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:17,148
to leave out of your minestrone
of emotions:

676
00:28:17,183 --> 00:28:18,516
guilt.

677
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,154
There's nobody here.

678
00:28:23,189 --> 00:28:25,757
We can do whatever we want.

679
00:28:25,791 --> 00:28:27,692
And nobody has to know.

680
00:28:37,837 --> 00:28:39,804
Hey, my sexy working man.

681
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:42,674
Look. I got us a bunch
of binge foods to celebrate.

682
00:28:53,886 --> 00:28:56,354
Babe, what's wrong?

683
00:28:59,492 --> 00:29:01,426
(sighs) I'm so sorry.

684
00:29:02,728 --> 00:29:05,330
I cheated on you.

685
00:29:08,234 --> 00:29:11,937
I was at my shoot and this
photographer was all over me

686
00:29:11,971 --> 00:29:13,772
and it was so intense.

687
00:29:13,806 --> 00:29:16,708
It was like that scene in<i> Fame,</i>
and she just... kissed me.

688
00:29:16,742 --> 00:29:18,843
And...

689
00:29:18,878 --> 00:29:20,612
and then what happened?

690
00:29:20,646 --> 00:29:22,347
I got so upset I started crying

691
00:29:22,381 --> 00:29:24,816
and then she took some photos
of me crying in my underwear

692
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:26,685
and then I just left.

693
00:29:28,754 --> 00:29:30,689
Sam, you didn't cheat on me.

694
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,000
It's not
like you kissed her back.

695
00:29:33,025 --> 00:29:35,060
Well, like,
I kind of sort of did

696
00:29:35,094 --> 00:29:36,962
but it was just, like, one
of those reflex reactions

697
00:29:36,996 --> 00:29:38,063
that you have
when someone kisses you.

698
00:29:38,097 --> 00:29:39,377
Like, kind of, you know, like...

699
00:29:40,266 --> 00:29:42,601
- See? Like that.
- Ugh.

700
00:29:42,635 --> 00:29:45,537
I can't do this to you anymore.

701
00:29:45,571 --> 00:29:49,407
Sam, I-I love you so much.

702
00:29:49,442 --> 00:29:52,143
But I'm looking
at my life, and...

703
00:29:52,178 --> 00:29:55,480
I don't think I'm gonna be ready
until I'm, like, 30.

704
00:29:55,514 --> 00:29:57,415
And asking you to wait that long

705
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:00,085
is like asking a cheetah
not to run.

706
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:02,687
It's okay.
I'm okay with it. I...

707
00:30:02,722 --> 00:30:05,090
Yeah, it's-it's hard, but...

708
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:09,070
I just have this feeling that
we're meant to be together.

709
00:30:09,095 --> 00:30:12,397
Yeah, who's to say
that we're not?

710
00:30:12,431 --> 00:30:15,133
Y-You think
I'm gonna cheat on you?

711
00:30:15,167 --> 00:30:17,535
No, actually,

712
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:19,738
I think you won't.

713
00:30:20,906 --> 00:30:23,475
And I think you'll
resent me for it.

714
00:30:23,509 --> 00:30:25,810
And I think
that we're holding on

715
00:30:25,845 --> 00:30:27,479
way too tight

716
00:30:27,513 --> 00:30:29,547
and we're not believing
in our love

717
00:30:29,582 --> 00:30:31,449
and we're gonna break it.

718
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:38,657
It's gonna burn me
to see you with other girls.

719
00:30:39,659 --> 00:30:43,261
But I know
this is the right thing.

720
00:30:46,933 --> 00:30:49,234
Just know that...

721
00:30:49,268 --> 00:30:52,737
whoever I'm with
or whatever I'm doing,

722
00:30:52,772 --> 00:30:54,839
I'd rather be doing it with you.

723
00:30:58,344 --> 00:30:59,978
Hey.

724
00:31:00,012 --> 00:31:01,980
Hey. Just...

725
00:31:06,252 --> 00:31:07,919
Let's make a deal.

726
00:31:07,954 --> 00:31:09,588
If I...

727
00:31:09,622 --> 00:31:13,858
if I do decide to change
my mind and not wait,

728
00:31:13,893 --> 00:31:16,027
I'll give you a call.

729
00:31:16,062 --> 00:31:19,397
(chuckles) Deal.

730
00:31:19,432 --> 00:31:21,433

everything and be here

stand any of this.

I'm here because he is
the love of my life

is gonna come between us.

00:34:24,255 --> 00:34:25,956
Thank you.
Thank you all so very much.

790
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:27,357
Um, before we end tonight,

791
00:34:27,391 --> 00:34:30,126
I would like to give a very,
very special thank you to

792
00:34:30,161 --> 00:34:32,596
my benefactor, June Dolloway.

793
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,864
The woman that taught me
that talent is worthless

794
00:34:34,899 --> 00:34:36,733
unless you can really
back it up with passion.

795
00:34:36,767 --> 00:34:38,935
And so I'd like
to use that passion

796
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:41,438
to pick my last song.

797
00:34:41,472 --> 00:34:45,008
Because there is nothing
I am more passionate about...

798
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:47,210
than my fiancé.

799
00:34:48,779 --> 00:34:50,447
So, um, Kurt...

800
00:34:50,481 --> 00:34:52,601
would you like to sing
this last duet with me?

801
00:34:52,617 --> 00:34:54,050
Oh...

802
00:34:55,786 --> 00:34:58,088
If you all came here
to get to know me tonight,

803
00:34:58,122 --> 00:34:59,162
there's no better way

804
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:02,058
than seeing me
with my one true love.

805
00:35:05,263 --> 00:35:06,463
(applause)

Oh, my God.

861
00:37:20,731 --> 00:37:22,766
June, I-I'm so sorry,
I-I just had to.

862
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,968
No, no, no.
You two were terrific.

863
00:37:25,002 --> 00:37:26,136
They loved you.

864
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:28,210
And I'm gonna take
credit for all of this.

865
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:30,907
It's been a long time since
anybody's proven me wrong.

866
00:37:30,942 --> 00:37:33,443
June, thank you so much.
Thank you, really.

867
00:37:33,477 --> 00:37:34,477
Thank you for all of this.

868
00:37:34,512 --> 00:37:36,646
Don't ever let anyone...
even me...

869
00:37:36,681 --> 00:37:38,648
make you doubt
what you're sure of.

870
00:37:38,683 --> 00:37:39,749
Okay.

871
00:37:39,784 --> 00:37:42,185
You. Come. Stand.

872
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,920
Okay.

873
00:37:43,955 --> 00:37:46,456
You remind me of
my third marriage.

874
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:47,624
My husband was gay, too.

875
00:37:47,658 --> 00:37:49,125
(all chuckle) True love.

876
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,261
(laughs)

877
00:37:51,295 --> 00:37:52,629
Okay, let's have a party.

878
00:37:52,663 --> 00:37:54,798
- Yeah.
- Oh.

879
00:37:54,832 --> 00:37:56,800
Party!
(all cheering)

880
00:37:59,147 --> 00:38:01,925
Thing about love is that
it's not a scarce resource.

881
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:03,784
The more you give,
the more you have to give."

882
00:38:03,818 --> 00:38:04,785
Aw.

883
00:38:04,819 --> 00:38:07,721
- Yay.
- RACHEL: Yay, I love it.

884
00:38:07,755 --> 00:38:10,297
Do you guys like it?

885
00:38:10,331 --> 00:38:11,665
I can walk in the script.

886
00:38:11,699 --> 00:38:13,033
Well, she's handing it in
to the network, so...

887
00:38:13,067 --> 00:38:14,167
we should hear soon.

888
00:38:14,202 --> 00:38:15,902
The other one was better.

889
00:38:15,937 --> 00:38:16,837
You know, I always thought

890
00:38:16,871 --> 00:38:18,205
that Fanny was the role

891
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:19,406
that I was born to play,

892
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,974
but then I read this.

893
00:38:21,008 --> 00:38:22,175
This is it.

894
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:24,211
This is my dream role,
you guys, and thank you

895
00:38:24,245 --> 00:38:25,812
so much for pushing me
to get it right.

896
00:38:25,847 --> 00:38:27,080
KURT:
A toast.

897
00:38:27,114 --> 00:38:29,015
To two glorious years in
the greatest city on earth.

898
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:31,618
Cheers to that. Cheers.
Cheers to that.

899
00:38:31,652 --> 00:38:34,132
RACHEL: So very much. Holy crap.

900
00:38:34,971 --> 00:38:36,532
MERCEDES:
What...?

901
00:38:36,557 --> 00:38:38,859
Oh, my God.

902
00:38:38,893 --> 00:38:41,261
RACHEL: Oh, my God.
(gasps) Oh, my God, Sam,

903
00:38:41,295 --> 00:38:42,829
I am so proud of you.

904
00:38:42,864 --> 00:38:44,531
I did it. I made
my dream come true.

905
00:38:44,565 --> 00:38:47,400
Look at this. Ah.
The abs, the...

906
00:38:47,435 --> 00:38:49,436
the nipples are even.
Oh, my gosh, this is great.

907
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:51,671
It is the start
of a great career.

908
00:38:51,706 --> 00:38:53,707
Nope. It's the finish.

909
00:38:53,741 --> 00:38:56,610
I came out here to get my
junk on the side of a bus

910
00:38:56,644 --> 00:38:58,912
and I did it.

911
00:38:58,946 --> 00:39:00,213
Going out on top

912
00:39:00,248 --> 00:39:01,414
Or on the side, really.

913
00:39:01,449 --> 00:39:03,016
What are you gonna do now?

914
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:05,485
I think I'm gonna go back home.
I just want to be in a space

915
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,187
where, you know,
the only sounds I hear at night

916
00:39:07,221 --> 00:39:08,655
are the crickets
and the rendering plant.

917
00:39:08,689 --> 00:39:09,956
My mind just works better when

918
00:39:09,991 --> 00:39:11,391
everything's a little slower.

919
00:39:11,425 --> 00:39:13,693
Plus, everybody here is
just scattering, anyway, so...

920
00:39:17,565 --> 00:39:19,966
It's the end of another era
for us Glee kids.

921
00:39:20,001 --> 00:39:22,269
Yeah.

922
00:39:23,971 --> 00:39:26,873
Yeah. It's been quite
a year, you guys.

923
00:39:28,242 --> 00:39:30,710
Finn and the Glee Club...

924
00:39:30,745 --> 00:39:33,246
I don't think I can really
handle losing anything else.

925
00:39:33,281 --> 00:39:35,015
Who said that you
have to lose anything?

926
00:39:35,049 --> 00:39:37,184
No, he's right.
It's like the end of an era.

927
00:39:37,218 --> 00:39:38,652
Sam said it...
we're all gonna be

928
00:39:38,686 --> 00:39:41,254
scattered all over the place
soon. I mean, you do realize

929
00:39:41,289 --> 00:39:43,356
that if I get this TV show,
it'll be the first time

930
00:39:43,391 --> 00:39:45,725
that we're apart in five years.

931
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,194
Well, I think if
we can get through that,

932
00:39:47,228 --> 00:39:48,328
our friendship
can survive anything.

933
00:39:48,362 --> 00:39:49,930
(coos) Oh.

934
00:39:49,964 --> 00:39:52,499
Kurt's right. I'm in this with
you guys for the long haul.

935
00:39:52,533 --> 00:39:54,253
RACHEL: Okay, then,
you know what, you guys?

936
00:39:54,268 --> 00:39:55,735
Let's make a deal.

937
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:57,737
Six months from now,
we all come back,

938
00:39:57,772 --> 00:39:59,339
right here, to this place,

939
00:39:59,373 --> 00:40:02,509
because I'm gonna need
something to look forward to.

940
00:40:02,543 --> 00:40:04,177
If I've learned
anything this year,

941
00:40:04,212 --> 00:40:06,913
it's that you guys are my life.

942
00:40:06,948 --> 00:40:08,315
Let's hug it out. Come on.

943
00:40:08,349 --> 00:40:09,716
Yes, yes, yes.
Let's do it.

944
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:11,117
Bring it in!

945
00:40:12,687 --> 00:40:15,589
Oh, guys, I would kill
