00:00:11,577 --> 00:00:15,513
 O Canada! 

3
00:00:15,614 --> 00:00:21,503
 Our home
and native land! 

4
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:25,173
 True patriot love 

5
00:00:25,274 --> 00:00:30,178
 in all thy sons' command 

6
00:00:30,313 --> 00:00:35,500
 With glowing hearts

 From far and wide 

9
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:45,610
 O Canada, 

10
00:00:45,711 --> 00:00:51,500
 we stand on
guard for thee 

11
00:00:51,601 --> 00:00:56,538
 God keep our land 

12
00:00:56,639 --> 00:01:01,892

13
00:01:01,993 --> 00:01:04,979
 O Canada,

15
00:01:12,004 --> 00:01:15,624
 O Canada,

Here I come,
Gump.

20
00:01:35,878 --> 00:01:38,279
Just to let you know, I'll
be going around to your left.

21
00:01:38,281 --> 00:01:39,381
Oh!

22
00:01:39,482 --> 00:01:40,982
And...
Through your legs, Stan!

23
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:44,235
And, oh my goodness!
Was that a no-look,

24
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:46,104
shoulder flip,
behind the back,

25
00:01:46,205 --> 00:01:48,105

He scores!

26
00:01:48,206 --> 00:01:52,544

<i>That ain't so hot.</i>

29
00:01:57,366 --> 00:01:58,716
You talking to me?

30
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:00,134
Suppose I am.

31
00:02:00,235 --> 00:02:01,619
<i>Well,</i>
<i>just so you know,</i>

32
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,254
there's no smoking
on the ice surface.

33
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:04,605
It's a public place.

34
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:05,957
<i>Yeah,</i>
<i>that's right.</i>

35
00:02:06,058 --> 00:02:07,875
<i>Yeah,</i>
<i>put it out.</i>

36
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:12,447
Hey!

37
00:02:12,548 --> 00:02:14,065
<i>What was that all about?</i>

38
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,199
There's no need
for violence --

39
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,168
especially when
playing sports.

40
00:02:17,269 --> 00:02:19,070
<i><laughs></i>
<i>You're kidding?</i>

41
00:02:19,171 --> 00:02:21,256
<i>Well, I'm confused.</i>
<i>'Cause rumour has it,</i>

42
00:02:21,357 --> 00:02:22,641
you're supposed
to be pretty good.

43
00:02:22,741 --> 00:02:24,676
I wouldn't know
anything about rumours.

44

He's home-schooled.

45

<i>He lives kind of</i>
<i>a sheltered life.</i>

46
00:02:27,496 --> 00:02:29,547
Shut your mouth,
marginal member of society.

47
00:02:29,648 --> 00:02:30,881
Whoa...

48
00:02:30,982 --> 00:02:32,684
Look, I got fifty bucks
that says I can take you

49
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:34,419
and the first
one to ten wins.

50
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,670
I don't gamble.

51
00:02:35,771 --> 00:02:37,739
And I ain't askin'.

52
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,691
I could give you
fifty bucks, Farley.

53
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:42,310
<i>Last night I hit the</i>

57
00:02:50,586 --> 00:02:52,520
 My home rink, 

58
00:02:52,622 --> 00:02:54,556
<i> your puck </i>

59
00:02:54,657 --> 00:02:57,225
 You're foolish and I'm

60
00:02:57,326 --> 00:02:58,627


61
00:02:58,728 --> 00:03:00,227
 Yeah,
good luck. 

62
00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:02,497


63
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:06,017
 How much more
perfect can you get? 

64
00:03:06,118 --> 00:03:09,104


65
00:03:09,171 --> 00:03:11,740
 Stick on the ice,
puck in the net. 

66
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,543


67
00:03:15,645 --> 00:03:17,145
 One, two, three, four! 

68
00:03:17,246 --> 00:03:18,646
 In a row,
how many more? 

69
00:03:18,747 --> 00:03:19,998
 Five, six, seven, eight! 

70
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,533
 Is this your first
time on skates? 

71
00:03:22,634 --> 00:03:25,420
 That makes nine,
one more makes ten 

72
00:03:25,521 --> 00:03:26,971
 Fifty bucks! 

73
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:28,323
 Who's getting drunk again! 

74
00:03:28,424 --> 00:03:31,892
<cheering>

75
00:03:31,993 --> 00:03:33,828
 I've seen the
greats on skates 

76
00:03:33,929 --> 00:03:35,330
 From the Great Slave Lake 

77
00:03:35,431 --> 00:03:37,465
 to the
Great Lakes States 

78
00:03:37,566 --> 00:03:40,818
 Yeah, great story,
has-been, pay up. 

79
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:43,288
 I know just what it takes. 

80
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,624
 If it weren't for
a few mistakes, 

81
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:51,195
 I could have been
in the NHL 

82
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:52,630
 Aw,
like hell! 

83
00:03:52,731 --> 00:03:54,665
 Are we supposed to
believe that baloney? 

84
00:03:54,766 --> 00:03:57,886
 You'd be lucky to
drive a Zamboni!

85
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:01,922
 Seriously, I know
what I'm talking about. 

86
00:04:02,023 --> 00:04:04,526
 I know there's a fifty,
you better pay out! 

87
00:04:04,693 --> 00:04:07,695
 It was worth it and
I rise above it. 

88
00:04:07,796 --> 00:04:09,597
 It was an honour
to play you. 

89
00:04:09,698 --> 00:04:11,782
 Shove it! 

90
00:04:16,588 --> 00:04:17,655
<i>Looks like the</i>
<i>Sherpa training's</i>

91

92
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,025
Hey,
Eve.

93
00:04:21,126 --> 00:04:22,927
Hey
Farley.

94
00:04:23,095 --> 00:04:24,562
So how was
practice today?

95
00:04:24,663 --> 00:04:26,380
We have a new
player in the group.

96
00:04:26,481 --> 00:04:28,883
Marco is a virtuoso

97
00:04:28,984 --> 00:04:30,451
who just arrived
from Milan.

98
00:04:30,552 --> 00:04:33,054
<i>I've never heard</i>
<i>anyone play so well.</i>

99
00:04:33,288 --> 00:04:34,705
It makes me feel like

100
00:04:34,806 --> 00:04:36,607
taking my
mother's advice and

101
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,042
signing up for
medical school

102
00:04:38,143 --> 00:04:39,777
when I hear
someone that talented.

103
00:04:39,878 --> 00:04:42,313
Eve, you can't
let your dream

104
00:04:42,381 --> 00:04:44,065
<i>of making the symphony</i>
<i>die just 'cause some</i>

105

<i>comes into your backyard</i>

106
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,852
with some fancy moves.

107
00:04:47,953 --> 00:04:50,488
Listen to you with
your sports metaphors.

108
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,590
For a second there I almost
<i>thought you were a jock.</i>

109
00:04:52,691 --> 00:04:53,724
As if.

110
00:04:53,825 --> 00:04:57,578


111
00:04:57,679 --> 00:05:01,315
 Eve and I have known each
other since we were two 

112
00:05:01,417 --> 00:05:05,870
 Our parents met at a
fundraiser for Desmond Tutu 

113
00:05:05,971 --> 00:05:09,591
 She moved in next door
at the age of three. 

114
00:05:09,692 --> 00:05:13,528
 That we would be best
friends was destiny. 

115
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:17,232
 We're best friends
through thick and thin. 

116
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,601
 Both home-schooled
weirdos 

117
00:05:19,702 --> 00:05:21,869
 that could never fit in. 

118
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:25,723
 Best friends through
thick and thin. 

119
00:05:25,824 --> 00:05:30,094
 When I was five I threw up
on her colony of ants. 

120
00:05:30,195 --> 00:05:32,563
 Farley once made
me laugh so hard 

121
00:05:32,664 --> 00:05:34,732
 that I peed my pants. 

122
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:35,984
 She knows all my secrets. 

123
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:38,153
 There's nothing to hide. 

124
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:39,654
 He knows all my secrets 

125
00:05:39,755 --> 00:05:43,324
 except one that I hide. 

126
00:05:43,425 --> 00:05:46,828
 We're best friends
through thick and thin. 

127
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,930
 Both home-schooled
weirdos 

128
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:51,032

129
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,418
 We're best friends

130
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,619


131
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,122
 Easy with each other
like second skin. 

132
00:05:58,223 --> 00:06:01,359
 We're best friends
through thick and thin. 

133
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:04,195


134
00:06:04,262 --> 00:06:08,066
 Eve's my best friend
in the whole world. 

135
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:12,052
 It's never mattered
that she's a girl. 

136
00:06:12,153 --> 00:06:16,557
 Farley's my best friend
in the whole wide world. 

137
00:06:16,658 --> 00:06:20,862
 He's got the sensitivity
of a girl. 

138
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,697
 Best friends

145
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,517
 Farley's my soul mate. 

146
00:06:43,618 --> 00:06:46,587
 He thinks it's platonic. 

147
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:51,893


148
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:54,195
<i>We have some wonderful news,</i>

The ice is perfect right now.

I think I'm going to go to
the rink for another hour

00:07:41,076 --> 00:07:44,545
 You're free to walk
out the door. 

167
00:07:44,914 --> 00:07:47,165
 But I think it
needs to be said, 

168
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:51,069
 too much hockey's not
good for the head. 

169
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:54,222
 Parents,
your worries are in vain.

170
00:07:54,322 --> 00:07:57,741
 Playing shinny will
not rot my brain. 

171
00:07:57,843 --> 00:08:01,645
 In fact, study after study
has conclusively proven 

172
00:08:01,746 --> 00:08:05,749
 the benefits of
exercise-induced movin'. 

173
00:08:05,851 --> 00:08:08,135


174
00:08:08,236 --> 00:08:11,472
<i> Look at the temperature</i>
<i>it's colder than Venus. </i>

175
00:08:11,573 --> 00:08:13,308
 You'll get frostbite
on your -- 

176
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:14,708
Toe.

177
00:08:14,977 --> 00:08:17,344
 I'm wearing my
organic wool sweater 

178
00:08:17,446 --> 00:08:19,180
 so I'm good to go. 

179
00:08:19,281 --> 00:08:20,498


180
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:24,702
 Though physical activity
is a worthwhile tonic. 

181
00:08:24,803 --> 00:08:28,489
 The clientele at the
rink is rather moronic. 

182
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:31,826
 Elitism about
sports aside, 

183
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:34,996
<i> even Einstein,</i>
<i>over the ice </i>

184
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:39,083
 he liked to glide. 

185
00:08:39,184 --> 00:08:41,435
<i> Oh,</i>
<i>where's our Farley? </i>

186
00:08:41,536 --> 00:08:44,305
 The boy that we adore.
Where's our Farley? 

187
00:08:44,406 --> 00:08:47,141
 Why's he always
skipping out the door? 

188
00:08:47,242 --> 00:08:50,427
 Where's your Farley?
He loves to skate and score. 

189
00:08:50,729 --> 00:08:54,448
 Where's your Farley?
He'll be back for dinner. 

190
00:08:54,549 --> 00:08:58,252


191
00:08:58,353 --> 00:08:59,320
Come on.

192
00:08:59,421 --> 00:09:01,255
You're going to make
your granddad late.

193
00:09:01,356 --> 00:09:03,357
I don't want to
go to daycare!

194
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:04,892
Well,
you're going.

195
00:09:04,993 --> 00:09:06,894
<grunts>

196
00:09:06,995 --> 00:09:09,097
Aw, get up,
you little bastard.

197
00:09:09,197 --> 00:09:10,397
Come on.

198
00:09:10,482 --> 00:09:11,515
Granddad,

199
00:09:11,616 --> 00:09:16,136
go screw yourself!

200
00:09:16,237 --> 00:09:18,506
Uh...

201
00:09:18,607 --> 00:09:19,840
Walk away,
Walter.

202
00:09:19,941 --> 00:09:21,442
Just walk away.

203
00:09:21,543 --> 00:09:42,230
 Beethoven's Ode to Joy 

204
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:44,431
Hey,
son!

205
00:09:44,532 --> 00:09:45,983
You talking to me,
sir?

206
00:09:46,084 --> 00:09:48,252
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>What's your name?</i>

207
00:09:48,353 --> 00:09:49,654
Farley Gordon.

208
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,405
It doesn't ring a bell.

209
00:09:51,506 --> 00:09:52,674
How old are you?

210
00:09:52,775 --> 00:09:54,007
Seventeen.

211
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:57,161
Who owns your rights?

212
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:59,380
Sir, there's a little kid
attached to your leg.

213
00:09:59,481 --> 00:10:02,300
And I don't have any idea
what you're talking about.

214
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:05,068
<i>Yeah,</i>
<i>it's my grandson.</i>

215
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:08,089
There's hope we can
domesticate him one day.

216
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,557
So who do you play for?

217
00:10:09,658 --> 00:10:11,459
Nobody.
Never have.

218
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,361
What?
Why not?

219
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,897
My parents don't believe
in team competitions.

220
00:10:16,998 --> 00:10:19,032
What are they,
communists?

221
00:10:19,133 --> 00:10:21,619
<i>Ah, not in the</i>
<i>classic sense, though.</i>

222
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,688
They're kind of more
like pacifist-anarchists,

223
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:27,324
although I'm sure they'd deny
even that categorization.

224
00:10:27,425 --> 00:10:28,842
You mean to tell me
you've never played

225
00:10:28,944 --> 00:10:30,844
an organized game of
hockey in your life?

226
00:10:30,946 --> 00:10:32,146
<i>That's right.</i>

227
00:10:32,247 --> 00:10:34,298
Just whatever games I can
pick up here on the rink.

228
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,550
<chuckles>

229
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:39,720
Well, son, my name
is Walt Acorn.

230
00:10:39,821 --> 00:10:42,923
I'm the owner of
the Brampton Blades.

231
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,625
<i>I want the chance to sit down</i>

232
00:10:44,726 --> 00:10:46,310
<i>with you and your parents</i>

233
00:10:46,411 --> 00:10:49,964
<i>and</i> talk over your
future in hockey.

234
00:10:50,065 --> 00:10:52,466
I'm not sure I understand.

235
00:10:52,567 --> 00:10:54,535
<i>If you could do half of</i>
<i>what I saw you do today</i>

236
00:10:54,636 --> 00:10:56,237
in an organized game,

237
00:10:56,338 --> 00:10:58,740
you could be
the next Sidney Crosby.

238
00:11:00,525 --> 00:11:02,360
Cindy who?

239
00:11:03,661 --> 00:11:06,580
<i>We don't speak athlete</i>
<i>in this family.</i>

240
00:11:06,681 --> 00:11:08,783
And we have
no desire to sign

241
00:11:08,884 --> 00:11:11,085
Farley up for hockey.

242
00:11:11,186 --> 00:11:13,587
And what with his
pottery classes

243
00:11:13,688 --> 00:11:16,490
<i>and his volunteering</i>
<i>at the museum</i>

244
00:11:16,591 --> 00:11:18,025
<i>and his much-anticipated</i>

245
00:11:18,126 --> 00:11:20,528
<i>hands-on</i>
<i>anthropology course--</i>

246
00:11:20,629 --> 00:11:22,946
Throw in the all-things
Chechnya extravaganza

247
00:11:23,047 --> 00:11:24,615
to that equation and--

248
00:11:24,716 --> 00:11:27,084
It's obvious
there's no time for

249
00:11:27,185 --> 00:11:30,454
organized team
hockey in his schedule.

250
00:11:30,555 --> 00:11:31,756
Wow!

251
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:34,525
This conversation
just laid a giant turd

252
00:11:34,626 --> 00:11:37,795
in the shallow end
of the stupid pool.

253
00:11:40,465 --> 00:11:43,818
<i>So... I take it</i>
<i>we're done here.</i>

254
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:46,420
Thankfully,
<i>yes.</i>

255
00:11:46,522 --> 00:11:47,988
Unless, of course,
you'd like to hear

256
00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:50,590
another of
my folk songs.

257
00:11:50,692 --> 00:11:54,011
 Hugs are free. 

258
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:57,598
 So hug away. 

259
00:11:57,699 --> 00:11:59,499
 Hugs, hugs, hugs. 

260
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,952
 Hugs are free. 

261
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:05,022
Well, that's a definite
Kumba-Nah there, toots.

262
00:12:05,123 --> 00:12:08,559
<i>Son,</i>
<i>you know,</i>

263
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:11,629
I've been around hockey
over sixty years.

264
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,697
This is the first time I've
ever had to tell someone

265
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:17,235
they're making a
huge mistake...

266
00:12:17,335 --> 00:12:20,872
You're making
a huge mistake.

267
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:23,540
Put on your
big boy pants,

268
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:27,011
carpe life
by the balls.

269
00:12:27,112 --> 00:12:29,413
You have a gift.

270
00:12:29,514 --> 00:13:05,615


271
00:13:05,716 --> 00:13:07,217
What's wrong,
Farley?

272
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:08,718
You've been on
Planet Glum all morning.

273
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,022
Okay.

274
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:14,591
I want to give
organized hockey a try.

275
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:17,862
Team sports?

276
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:18,863
Really?

277
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,264
Maybe my id is
out on a day pass

278
00:13:20,365 --> 00:13:22,266
but it's all
I can think about.

279
00:13:22,367 --> 00:13:23,701
And let me guess.

280
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:26,303
Your parents think the idea
is more inherently evil

281
00:13:26,404 --> 00:13:27,872
than
genetically-modified food

282
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,439
and organized
religion.

283
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:30,474
Yeah.

284
00:13:30,575 --> 00:13:34,312


285
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:37,415
 Farley Gordon, you should
always follow your heart. 

286
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:41,052
 But everyone knows
that hockey's not art. 

287
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,619
 I've never been to camp 

288
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:44,722
 or even played on a team. 

289
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:47,491
 I've never been
away from my parents. 

290
00:13:47,592 --> 00:13:51,178
 And you're
seventeen. 

291
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,782
 I'm seventeen. 

292
00:13:54,883 --> 00:13:57,284
 He's seventeen. 

293
00:13:57,385 --> 00:14:03,290


294
00:14:03,391 --> 00:14:06,860
 Eventually we all have to
cut the umbilical cord. 

295
00:14:06,962 --> 00:14:10,497
 What if I don't fit in?
What if I get bored? 

296
00:14:10,598 --> 00:14:14,218
 Embrace the Zen mindset for
this part of your journey. 

297
00:14:14,319 --> 00:14:18,689
 Quit if you find
group sports unworthy. 

298
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:24,962


299
00:14:25,063 --> 00:14:27,064
 So you think that
I should join. 

300
00:14:27,232 --> 00:14:28,999
 Should I give it a shot? 

301
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,667
 What have you
got to lose? 

302
00:14:30,768 --> 00:14:32,702
 So why?
So why not? 

303
00:14:32,803 --> 00:14:36,306
 So I'll join the team
and I'll give it a shot. 

304
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:40,010
 So you'll join the team.
So you'll give it a shot. 

305
00:14:40,111 --> 00:14:41,878
 Yeah,
I'm seventeen. 

306
00:14:41,979 --> 00:14:43,714
 I might like it a lot. 

307
00:14:43,815 --> 00:14:45,349
 Yeah,
you're seventeen. 

308
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,451
 You'll probably
like it a lot. 

309
00:14:47,552 --> 00:14:49,753
 And by doing so we can 

310
00:14:49,854 --> 00:14:52,323
 advance the plot. 

311
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:56,610
 Plot, plot, plot. 

312
00:14:56,711 --> 00:14:58,211
Call this a
mother's intuition,

313
00:14:58,312 --> 00:15:00,114
but this has
Neanderthal and

314
00:15:00,214 --> 00:15:02,382
ne'er-do-well
written all over it.

315
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:05,152
I promise I won't do anything
to not make you proud.

316
00:15:05,253 --> 00:15:06,653
<i>Interesting.</i>

317
00:15:06,754 --> 00:15:07,855
Double negative.

318
00:15:07,956 --> 00:15:10,057
Like hockey
and violence.

319
00:15:10,158 --> 00:15:11,992
Please.
I'm going to Brampton,

320
00:15:12,093 --> 00:15:13,460
not Bosnia,
okay?

321
00:15:13,562 --> 00:15:15,829
I'll be back by dinner.

322
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:16,897
Goodbye,
Farley.

323
00:15:16,998 --> 00:15:18,398
Goodbye.

324
00:15:18,499 --> 00:15:21,018
Love you.

325
00:15:21,152 --> 00:15:22,669
Did you ever play
hockey, Edgar?

326
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:24,588


327
00:15:24,689 --> 00:15:26,474
<i>Figure skating</i>
<i>was my world.</i>

328
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:29,376
Agh!

329
00:15:29,477 --> 00:15:31,345
And since then
I've had a hatred

330
00:15:31,446 --> 00:15:33,981
for all things hockey.

331
00:15:34,082 --> 00:15:35,282
<i><whistle></i>

332
00:15:35,383 --> 00:15:37,951
<i>Come on,</i>

333
00:15:38,086 --> 00:15:40,420
To your left! Get on him!
To your left!

334
00:15:40,521 --> 00:15:41,772
Lookin' good!
Lookin' good!

335
00:15:41,873 --> 00:15:43,907
Hustle, hustle, hustle!

336
00:15:44,008 --> 00:15:45,543
<i>Make those passes count!</i>

<whistle>

341
00:15:57,489 --> 00:16:00,741
This is a closed practice.

342
00:16:00,842 --> 00:16:03,244
Well, actually, I'm here
to play on the team.

343
00:16:03,345 --> 00:16:04,711
What?

344
00:16:04,812 --> 00:16:06,247
<laughing>

345
00:16:06,348 --> 00:16:08,582
Excuse me?

346
00:16:08,683 --> 00:16:12,252
Ah, was, I was asked
to join the team.

347
00:16:12,353 --> 00:16:13,954
By who?

348
00:16:14,256 --> 00:16:16,740
"Whom."
It's actually "whom."

349
00:16:16,841 --> 00:16:19,409
It's the object of
the preposition.

350
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:22,346
I don't care if it's the
ass-end of a 12-point buck.

351
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:25,716
Answer the question.

352
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,851
Walt Acorn.

353
00:16:27,952 --> 00:16:29,670
You know that
the last nugget

354
00:16:29,771 --> 00:16:31,972
that Walt Acorn
unearthed for me

355
00:16:32,073 --> 00:16:34,274
played in only
one single game.

356
00:16:34,509 --> 00:16:36,877
Why,
what happened to him?

357
00:16:36,978 --> 00:16:39,112
Stopped a slap shot
with his tonsils.

358
00:16:39,213 --> 00:16:42,399
Broke his jaw
in four places.

359
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,735
<i>Do yourself</i>
<i>a favour, son.</i>

360
00:16:44,836 --> 00:16:46,103
It's not too late.

361
00:16:46,204 --> 00:16:48,605
Bust that sequined
unitard out of the closet,

362
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:49,973
sharpen up
those toe picks

363
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:52,192
and rejoin the
figure skating squad.

364
00:16:52,293 --> 00:16:53,210
Trust me.

365
00:16:53,311 --> 00:16:55,379
They'll welcome you
back with open arms.

366
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,515
I'm here to play hockey.

367
00:16:59,267 --> 00:17:00,734
Oh yeah?

368
00:17:03,154 --> 00:17:06,190
<i>We'll see</i>
<i>about that, peacock.</i>

369
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:08,458
Don't say I
didn't warn you.

370
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,248
This should fit.

371
00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:26,109
Is that right?

372
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:28,512
Not unless
you're a dick face.

373
00:17:28,613 --> 00:17:31,965
<i>Not like ladies,</i>
<i>like men!</i>

374
00:17:32,066 --> 00:17:34,552
<i>Go after it, guys,</i>
<i>go after it!</i>

375
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:38,321
<whistle>

376
00:17:40,358 --> 00:17:41,658
Up against the boards.

377
00:17:43,512 --> 00:17:45,078
Something wrong with
<i>your balls, son?</i>

378
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,614
No,
just the...

379
00:17:46,714 --> 00:17:49,900
equipment's a little
uncomfortable.

380
00:17:50,001 --> 00:17:53,186
Don't worry, you won't
be wearing it that long.

381
00:17:53,287 --> 00:17:56,290
<i>You!</i>
<i>Give us Bailey and Apps!</i>

382

383
00:18:00,028 --> 00:18:17,110


384
00:18:17,212 --> 00:18:19,779
That's cute,
twinkle toes.

385
00:18:19,881 --> 00:18:21,414
<i>Want to go again?</i>

386
00:18:21,515 --> 00:18:23,216
Yeah.

387
00:18:23,317 --> 00:18:25,602
<i>Ferguson,</i>
<i>McNamee!</i>

388

389
00:18:28,523 --> 00:18:29,706
<i>Let's see you,</i>
<i>kid.</i>

390
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:38,515


391
00:18:38,616 --> 00:18:40,317
<i>The Moose.</i>

392
00:18:40,418 --> 00:18:55,181


393
00:18:55,233 --> 00:18:56,767
Ugh!

394
00:18:56,868 --> 00:18:57,751
Boom.
Boom. Boom.

395
00:18:57,852 --> 00:18:59,786
Out go the lights.

396
00:19:05,976 --> 00:19:10,080
<moaning>

397
00:19:10,181 --> 00:19:11,915
Aristotle?

398
00:19:12,016 --> 00:19:14,584
That's a first.

399
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:16,987
What happened?

400
00:19:17,088 --> 00:19:19,690
Well, you ran into a brick
<i>wall named The Moose.</i>

401
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,674
I bet they heard
the hit in Mumbai.

402
00:19:25,179 --> 00:19:27,013
Hey!
Hey, boss!

403
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,584
We in the
hardware business?

404
00:19:30,685 --> 00:19:32,218
Sure feels like
I'm getting screwed.

405
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,720
You can't be serious about
letting that kid play.

406
00:19:33,822 --> 00:19:35,989
You saw what he did with the
puck 'til he got flattened.

407
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,724
That won't
happen again.

408
00:19:37,826 --> 00:19:39,493
One game,
regular shifts.

409
00:19:39,594 --> 00:19:41,161
If he's not as good
as I think he is,

410
00:19:41,262 --> 00:19:42,395
do what you want.

411
00:19:42,497 --> 00:19:43,831
Come on, Walt. He's going
to get killed out there.

412
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:48,469
Last time I checked,
I still own the team.

413
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:49,903
Pfft...

414
00:19:52,006 --> 00:19:54,708
Farley Gordon.

415
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,761
Ah,
there you are.

416
00:19:59,297 --> 00:20:00,730
Great meeting you,
<i>sprout.</i>

417
00:20:00,831 --> 00:20:01,965
Now, if you want
any information

418
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:03,633
on joining
our booster club,

419
00:20:03,734 --> 00:20:05,336
you'll find it on
our web site. Here.

420
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:06,970
Here's a T-shirt.
Thanks for coming out.

421
00:20:09,941 --> 00:20:12,276
So that's it,
I'm off the team?

422
00:20:14,929 --> 00:20:18,198
Well,
not technically.

423
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:20,133
But I figured
getting knocked out,

424
00:20:20,234 --> 00:20:21,268
that would be enough to
convince you

425
00:20:21,369 --> 00:20:23,203
that these are very,

426
00:20:23,304 --> 00:20:25,439
very dangerous waters

427
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,674
<i>that you're</i>
<i>lily-dipping in.</i>

428
00:20:29,794 --> 00:20:31,595
<i>Sir,</i>

429
00:20:31,696 --> 00:20:33,697
<i>do you ever have</i>
<i>those epiphany moments</i>

430
00:20:33,798 --> 00:20:34,998
where all of a sudden
the world starts making

431
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,302
a lot more sense?

432
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,936
Occasionally,
a good bowel movement

433
00:20:40,037 --> 00:20:42,306
will have that effect.

434
00:20:42,357 --> 00:20:43,890
Yeah.

435
00:20:43,991 --> 00:20:46,059
Well..

436
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:48,995
this might sound
stupid, but...

437
00:20:49,096 --> 00:20:50,697
before Walt Acorn
walked into my life

438
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:53,033
there was a hole,
a longing that

439
00:20:53,134 --> 00:20:54,601
I couldn't articulate
or, rather,

440
00:20:54,702 --> 00:20:56,002
I didn't even know existed.

441
00:20:56,103 --> 00:20:58,104
But I honestly believe
that organized hockey

442
00:20:58,206 --> 00:21:00,624
might just fill that hole.

443
00:21:00,725 --> 00:21:02,459
 What do you weigh,
kid? 

444
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,895
 A buck fifty-five? 

445
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:07,981
 I'm not that vain.
I'm not into my size. 

446
00:21:08,082 --> 00:21:09,666
 There are other
games that are more 

447
00:21:09,767 --> 00:21:11,534
 appropriate
for you to play - 

448
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:14,938
 Like checkers,
like chess, and croquet. 

449
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,740
 Well, I've always
been taught 

450
00:21:16,841 --> 00:21:18,442
 to see things through. 

451
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:24,064
 To my heart...
always be true 

452
00:21:24,165 --> 00:21:25,382


453
00:21:25,483 --> 00:21:28,251
 Hallmark, I'm sure,
would be so proud 

454
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:31,288
 to hear you voice those
sentiments out loud. 

455
00:21:31,389 --> 00:21:34,124
 But a well-played fart
would knock you down. 

456
00:21:34,225 --> 00:21:35,558
 If The Moose meant harm, 

457
00:21:35,659 --> 00:21:37,527
 you'd be in
a hospital gown. 

458
00:21:37,628 --> 00:21:40,581
 This is the toughest
league in the land. 

459
00:21:40,682 --> 00:21:43,733
 You'll never survive
so become a fan. 

460
00:21:43,785 --> 00:21:46,319
 Just because I still
have my front teeth, 

461
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:49,256
 don't assume
that I can't compete. 

462
00:21:49,357 --> 00:21:52,425
 Though I might not come
with a hockey pedigree - 

463
00:21:52,526 --> 00:21:54,128
 Why can't I still
dream of being 

464
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:55,863
 the next Crosby? 

465
00:21:55,964 --> 00:21:57,013
 You never played the game. 

466
00:21:57,114 --> 00:21:58,515
 No one even knows your name. 

467
00:21:58,616 --> 00:22:01,618
 Hockey legends
don't happen overnight. 

468
00:22:01,719 --> 00:22:02,986
 It takes a bunch of years 

469
00:22:03,087 --> 00:22:04,488
 and a bucketful of tears. 

470
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:06,957
 And to put you in
the game is suicide. 

471
00:22:08,158 --> 00:22:09,292
I can't kick
you off the team

472
00:22:09,393 --> 00:22:10,627
and I won't protect you.

473
00:22:10,728 --> 00:22:11,928
And when you're
lying in a coma,

474
00:22:12,029 --> 00:22:14,498
don't say
I didn't warn you.

475
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:15,866
Technically,
if I'm in a coma

476
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:17,501
I wouldn't
be able to speak.

477
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:24,508
One game.

478
00:22:31,265 --> 00:22:33,700
Doesn't Mr. Acorn's opinion
count for anything?

479
00:22:33,801 --> 00:22:35,168
I mean, obviously,
he saw something in me

480
00:22:35,269 --> 00:22:37,204
that he thought
worth giving a shot.

481
00:22:37,305 --> 00:22:40,474
He's legally blind
without his glasses.

482
00:22:40,575 --> 00:22:41,975
Yeah.                    No way.

483
00:22:42,076 --> 00:22:45,245
My guess he wasn't wearing
them when he discovered you.

484
00:22:45,346 --> 00:22:48,215
You didn't notice anything
strange about his behaviour?

485
00:22:48,316 --> 00:22:51,618
<barking>

486
00:22:51,719 --> 00:22:54,053
How long have
you owned a dog?

487
00:22:54,154 --> 00:22:57,924


488
00:22:59,927 --> 00:23:01,762
Tomorrow's game
<i>starts at two.</i>

489
00:23:01,862 --> 00:23:03,630
Don't be late,
tough guy.

490
00:23:07,134 --> 00:23:10,637
<i>I don't have to tell you</i>
<i>guys what this game means.</i>

491
00:23:13,107 --> 00:23:14,874
The Devils...

492
00:23:14,975 --> 00:23:16,810
dirty cheap-shot artists
who wouldn't hesitate

493
00:23:16,911 --> 00:23:18,578
to rip out their
mother's heart,

494
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,597
sell it on eBay
for a minimum bid

495
00:23:20,698 --> 00:23:23,466
if it meant two points.

496
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:26,670
Which is...

497
00:23:26,771 --> 00:23:27,871
<i><mouse squeaking></i>

498
00:23:28,022 --> 00:23:29,572
<i>..precisely why</i>
<i>they're in first place!</i>

499
00:23:29,673 --> 00:23:30,490
<i>Where's your passion?</i>

500
00:23:30,591 --> 00:23:31,792
A mouse!

501
00:23:31,893 --> 00:23:35,144
<team yelling>

502
00:23:35,245 --> 00:23:37,747
You mean this?
The common mus musculus.

503
00:23:37,848 --> 00:23:39,966
Get it out of here.

504
00:23:40,067 --> 00:23:42,152
<i>Game time!</i>

505
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:43,120
<i>Let's go, guys.</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

506
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:45,755
<i>Let's go.</i>

507
00:23:45,856 --> 00:23:47,624
<i>Go! Go! Go! Go!</i>

508
00:23:57,902 --> 00:23:59,035
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

509
00:23:59,136 --> 00:24:00,737
Who pooed
on your shirt?

510
00:24:01,005 --> 00:24:02,723
<grunts>

511
00:24:02,824 --> 00:24:04,374
<crowd cheering>

512
00:24:04,475 --> 00:24:06,109
Yeah!

513
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:10,514


514
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:11,581
Yes!
Yes!

515
00:24:11,682 --> 00:24:13,550
Mess him up!

516
00:24:13,651 --> 00:24:15,685
<i>Hit 'em high.</i>
<i>Hit 'em low.</i>

517
00:24:15,786 --> 00:24:18,355
Make him sing soprano!

518
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:33,103


519
00:24:33,204 --> 00:24:35,539
<shouting>

520
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,141
It's like Dante's
Inferno down there.

521
00:24:38,242 --> 00:24:43,981


522
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:45,548
You missed
the introductions.

523
00:24:45,649 --> 00:24:47,367


524
00:24:47,468 --> 00:24:50,136
What could have
caused all this?

525
00:24:50,237 --> 00:24:51,688
 Hockey without fighting 

526
00:24:51,789 --> 00:24:54,090
 is like Kraft Dinner
without cheese. 

527
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:56,026
 It's still pasta... 

528
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:58,678
 but the palate,
it won't please. 

529
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,614
 Violence in sport? 

530
00:25:00,715 --> 00:25:02,982
 Isn't this supposed
to be fun? 

531
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:04,818
 The boys are
letting off steam. 

532
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:07,670
 They're not
hurting anyone. 

533
00:25:07,771 --> 00:25:09,739
 La-dee-da-dee
Da-dee-dada 

534
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,875
 Jab, jab! Hook, hook!
Kidney punch! 

535
00:25:11,976 --> 00:25:14,143
 La-dee-da-dee
Da-dee-dada 

536
00:25:14,244 --> 00:25:16,613
 Jab, jab! Hook, hook!
Kidney punch! 

537
00:25:16,714 --> 00:25:18,431
 La-dee-da-dee
Da-dee-dada 

538
00:25:18,532 --> 00:25:21,067
 Jab, jab! Hook, hook!
Kidney punch! 

539
00:25:21,168 --> 00:25:22,836
 La-dee-da-dee
Da-dee-dada 

540
00:25:22,937 --> 00:25:25,388
 Jab, jab! Jersey pull!
Kidney punch! 

541
00:25:25,489 --> 00:25:28,124
<whistle>

542
00:25:28,225 --> 00:25:34,664


543
00:25:34,765 --> 00:25:36,365
<i> Haven't seen so</i>
<i>much gore since the </i>

544
00:25:36,466 --> 00:25:38,885
 Off-Broadway
production of Macbeth. 

545
00:25:38,986 --> 00:25:40,954
 At least Farley
wasn't involved 

546
00:25:41,055 --> 00:25:43,156
 in all the fracas. 

547
00:25:43,257 --> 00:25:45,575
<i> This is all</i>
<i>starting to feel </i>

548
00:25:45,676 --> 00:25:49,112
 less innocent,
I confess. 

549
00:25:49,213 --> 00:25:50,780
 You've led
a sheltered life, 

550
00:25:50,881 --> 00:25:52,682
 from what
I can surmise. 

551
00:25:52,783 --> 00:25:54,050
 But on the ice, 

552
00:25:54,151 --> 00:25:57,453
 the rules of
society don't apply. 

553
00:25:57,554 --> 00:25:59,455
 Cast your
worries aside, 

554
00:25:59,556 --> 00:26:01,758
 is my advice. 

555
00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:03,960
 'Cause this game
is the start of 

556
00:26:04,061 --> 00:26:07,063
 the rest of your life. 

557
00:26:07,164 --> 00:26:09,783
 organ 

558
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,567
<i>[announcer]</i>
<i>It's Friday in Blades country.</i>

559
00:26:11,668 --> 00:26:13,669
<i>And today's tilt against</i>
<i>the Duntroon Devils</i>

560
00:26:13,771 --> 00:26:15,839
is set to be a doozy

561
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,440
and not just
because the Devils

562
00:26:17,541 --> 00:26:19,442
are Public Enemy #1
in these parts.

563
00:26:19,543 --> 00:26:21,545
But because in an
unprecedented move in

564
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:23,346
Ontario Major
Hockey League history,

565
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:26,583
a player is set to make his
organized hockey debut.

566
00:26:26,684 --> 00:26:27,818
That's right,
folks.

567

All right, boys.
Let's have a clean game.

574
00:26:43,617 --> 00:26:45,051
Eat my rectal
cheese, Ref.

575
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,071
You're a dead man walking.

<i>That just obliterated</i>
<i>the record for</i>

580
00:27:05,255 --> 00:27:08,291
fastest goal by a rookie

00:27:30,848 --> 00:27:31,815
But got to
I remind you--

590
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:33,550
Keep my head up.
I know.

<i>Move it around, guys!</i>
<i>Come on, move it around!</i>

592
00:27:38,005 --> 00:27:39,222
Ever think of
passing the puck?

593
00:27:39,323 --> 00:27:41,491
Sorry, Coach, I looked.
There wasn't anybody around.

594
00:27:41,592 --> 00:27:42,809
<i>Wow!</i>

595
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:45,311
A dandy of a debut from
the novice from nowhere.

596
00:27:45,412 --> 00:27:47,180
Four goals,
two assists --

597
00:27:47,281 --> 00:27:48,548
except for the
Hall of Fame,

598
00:27:48,649 --> 00:27:51,084
I have never seen hockey
talent displayed so well.

599
00:27:51,185 --> 00:27:52,886
Farley Gordon, you are
the future of the sport.

600
00:27:52,987 --> 00:27:55,388
What do you
have to say?

601
00:27:55,489 --> 00:27:57,390
Clearly, much smoother
on his skates

602
00:27:57,491 --> 00:27:58,925
than he is in
front of the camera.

603
00:28:01,095 --> 00:28:02,412
<i>Gor-don!</i>
<i>Gor-don!</i>

608
00:28:08,285 --> 00:28:10,370
Hey!

609
00:28:15,909 --> 00:28:18,011
Bailey,
need to speak to you.

610
00:28:27,421 --> 00:28:29,388
What was that all about?

611
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:32,758
Because you're on the team,
Bailey's off.

612
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,961
True, his on-ice
skills might have been

613
00:28:35,062 --> 00:28:36,729
better served to
driving a Zamboni,

614
00:28:36,831 --> 00:28:40,033
but he was like
a son to Coach Donker.

615
00:28:41,568 --> 00:28:43,570
<i>Especially after Bailey</i>
<i>lost both his parents</i>

616
00:28:43,671 --> 00:28:46,055
to a grizzly attack.

617
00:28:46,156 --> 00:28:48,607
<i>Hockey was that damn</i>
<i>orphan's life,</i>

618
00:28:48,709 --> 00:28:50,276
his family.

619
00:28:51,879 --> 00:28:53,813
So that's why the
coach hates me.

620
00:28:55,382 --> 00:28:56,867
So what will Bailey do now?

621
00:28:58,669 --> 00:29:00,070
He'll probably
start pouring beer

622
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:02,272
on his breakfast
cereals.

623
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:04,074
Knock up his uglier

624
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:06,276
than day-old
poutine girlfriend.

625
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:07,693
One marriage,
two children,

626
00:29:07,794 --> 00:29:09,229
three affairs.

627
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:11,530
Significant hair loss,
back acne,

628
00:29:11,631 --> 00:29:13,233
weight gain.

629
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:14,734
And then twenty years
later he will be

630
00:29:14,835 --> 00:29:17,270
unceremoniously laid off
from his miserable job.

631
00:29:18,538 --> 00:29:20,506
The stress of this will lead
to a fatal heart attack

632
00:29:20,607 --> 00:29:21,558
within a week.

633
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:23,526
But at least death
will free him from

634
00:29:23,628 --> 00:29:26,095
the bitterness he's
felt every damn minute

635
00:29:26,196 --> 00:29:27,830
since that
Brampton Blades jersey

636
00:29:27,931 --> 00:29:31,200
was ripped
from his heart.

637
00:29:31,302 --> 00:29:33,353
But that's
just a guess.

638
00:29:33,454 --> 00:29:35,054
Welcome aboard.

639
00:29:35,155 --> 00:29:42,295


640
00:29:42,396 --> 00:29:44,430
 No doubt hockey players 

641
00:29:44,531 --> 00:29:47,767
 descended from baboons. 

642
00:29:47,868 --> 00:29:51,271
 Going by the behaviour
of those goons. 

643
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:53,072


644
00:29:53,173 --> 00:29:55,441
 Okay, I'll admit
that the violence 

645
00:29:55,542 --> 00:29:58,628
 was slightly excessive. 

646
00:29:58,729 --> 00:30:02,833
 The Roar of the crowd was
awfully impressive. 

647
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:04,384


648
00:30:04,485 --> 00:30:07,353
 I've never seen you
look so alive before. 

649
00:30:07,454 --> 00:30:10,089
 Rush of the game
made my spirits soar. 

650
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:12,825
 My brain was working in
rapturous elation 

651
00:30:12,927 --> 00:30:15,261
 trying to
figure out hockey, 

652
00:30:15,362 --> 00:30:17,614
 the equation. 

653
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:20,349
 Hockey,
the equation? 

654
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:22,602
 Hockey,            Hockey,
the equation.   the equation. 

655
00:30:22,703 --> 00:30:24,471
 Hockey,
the equation. 

656
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:27,706
 The math doesn't
make much sense. 

657
00:30:27,808 --> 00:30:29,608
<i> I'm shocked... </i>

658
00:30:29,709 --> 00:30:32,979
 to hear such
utter nonsense. 

659
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:37,867
<i> Dad, please I'm just</i>
<i>trying to have fun. </i>

660
00:30:37,968 --> 00:30:39,619
<i> I'm not joining the army </i>

661
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,472
<i> and I'm not</i>
<i>hurting anyone. </i>

662
00:30:42,573 --> 00:30:56,602


663
00:30:56,703 --> 00:30:59,105
<i>And to finish the</i>
<i>broadcast tonight...</i>

664
00:30:59,206 --> 00:31:01,975
I want to bring you the
story of a 17-year-old

665
00:31:02,076 --> 00:31:05,311
who might just be the best
amateur hockey player

666
00:31:05,412 --> 00:31:07,413
in the country today.

667
00:31:07,514 --> 00:31:09,382
The almost
unbelievable thing is

668
00:31:09,483 --> 00:31:12,301
<i>Farley Gordon has been</i>
<i>playing organized hockey</i>

669
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:14,971
<i>for exactly one game.</i>

670
00:31:15,072 --> 00:31:17,157
<i>Insiders are already</i>
<i>suggesting that his name</i>

671
00:31:17,258 --> 00:31:19,058
<i>might one day be mentioned</i>

672
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,260
<i>in the same exalted company</i>

673
00:31:21,362 --> 00:31:24,230
<i>as Howe, Orr,</i>
<i>Gretzky or Richard.</i>

674
00:31:24,332 --> 00:31:25,498
I want you to find out
everything you can

675
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:27,033
about this Farley Gordon.

676
00:31:27,134 --> 00:31:28,802
And I want someone to explain
to me why this kid

677
00:31:28,902 --> 00:31:30,537
wasn't on our radar before.

678
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:32,439
We pride ourselves on
knowing more than God

679
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,240
about hockey talent in Canada.

680
00:31:34,342 --> 00:31:35,875
Get on it.

681
00:31:35,976 --> 00:31:47,553


682
00:31:47,654 --> 00:31:49,773

685
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:05,922

<knock on window>

690
00:32:18,719 --> 00:32:20,186
Yeah.

691
00:32:24,091 --> 00:32:25,124
Mornin'.

692
00:32:25,225 --> 00:32:26,458
Hi,
Farley.

693
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,827
How was your
third game?

694
00:32:27,928 --> 00:32:29,729
Incredible. Even better
than the first two.

695
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:31,030
I loved every
minute of it.

696
00:32:31,131 --> 00:32:32,898
Except for the
two bench brawls.

697
00:32:32,999 --> 00:32:35,301
That's fantastic.

698
00:32:35,402 --> 00:32:36,436
Hey, how's the
practicing going?

699
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:39,222
Things going any better
with Carlo... Mario?

700
00:32:39,323 --> 00:32:41,824
Marco?

701
00:32:41,925 --> 00:32:44,060
Yeah.
A bit.

702
00:32:44,161 --> 00:32:52,535


703
00:32:58,075 --> 00:33:00,543
Your playing is...

704
00:33:00,644 --> 00:33:01,978
magnifico.

705
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:03,896
<i>It's like a voluptuous</i>

706
00:33:03,997 --> 00:33:05,764
<i>Chianti from Arezzo.</i>

707
00:33:05,865 --> 00:33:08,067
It's...

708
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:10,469
<i>...so un-Canadian.</i>

709
00:33:12,356 --> 00:33:14,958
Well, at least you're
making progress.

710
00:33:16,727 --> 00:33:17,627
I'm glad you
woke me up.

711
00:33:17,728 --> 00:33:19,362
I might have slept
through practice.

712
00:33:19,463 --> 00:33:22,131
But Wednesdays we volunteer
at the soup kitchen.

713
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:23,399
You're not coming?

714
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,067
Right.

715
00:33:25,168 --> 00:33:26,903
I forgot.

716
00:33:27,004 --> 00:33:29,506
I'm sure Coach won't mind
if I miss a practice.

717
00:33:31,425 --> 00:33:34,293
Does anyone know

718
00:33:34,394 --> 00:33:36,996
where our precious

719
00:33:37,097 --> 00:33:40,483
Farley Gordon might be?

720
00:33:40,584 --> 00:33:43,886
Kid scores nine goals in
<i>his first three games.</i>

721
00:33:43,987 --> 00:33:46,522
Maybe he doesn't
need to practice.

722
00:33:46,623 --> 00:33:49,625
You got a show pony
on your hands, Coach.

723
00:33:49,726 --> 00:33:52,562
Clearly he trots to the
beat of a different drummer.

724
00:33:54,798 --> 00:33:57,817
 Listen,
you dinosaur. 

725
00:33:57,918 --> 00:34:01,287
 There's
no 'I' in team. 

726
00:34:01,388 --> 00:34:04,908


727
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:07,877
 What's the real
issue, Coach? 

728
00:34:07,978 --> 00:34:11,547
 What's making
you scream? 

729
00:34:11,648 --> 00:34:14,767


730
00:34:14,868 --> 00:34:16,719
<i> I don't care if he</i>
<i>can write his name </i>

731
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:19,589
 backwards in the
snow with pee. 

732
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:21,024
<i> He misses practice, </i>

733
00:34:21,124 --> 00:34:23,826
 and I question
his sanity. 

734
00:34:23,927 --> 00:34:25,161


735
00:34:25,262 --> 00:34:29,566
 From what I saw, the upside
on Farley's stratospheric 

736
00:34:29,666 --> 00:34:31,234
 I've been getting
media requests 

737
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:34,571
 all the way from Inuvik. 

738
00:34:34,671 --> 00:34:36,506
<i> However, if you</i>
<i>have a problem </i>

739
00:34:36,607 --> 00:34:39,742
 with Gordon,
I won't disagree. 

740
00:34:39,809 --> 00:34:41,427
 You won't? 

741
00:34:41,445 --> 00:34:44,080
 I'll find a new coach who
can work with the prodigy. 

742
00:34:44,181 --> 00:34:45,865


743
00:34:45,966 --> 00:34:48,134
<i> La-da-da-da-da-da-da </i>

745

747
00:35:12,909 --> 00:35:14,443
<i>Well, my heart goes</i>
<i>out to the other team.</i>

748
00:35:14,544 --> 00:35:16,896
They clearly wanted to win
just as badly as we did.

749
00:35:16,997 --> 00:35:18,097
And then it just
seems kind of unfair

750
00:35:18,265 --> 00:35:19,348
that somebody has to lose.

751
00:35:19,449 --> 00:35:20,516
Am I hearing
what I'm hearing?

752
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,602
<i>You know, I wonder sometimes,</i>
<i>should we just</i>

753
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:24,270
throw out the scoreboard

754
00:35:24,371 --> 00:35:26,739
and just play
for the fun of it?

755
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,341
Wow.

756
00:35:31,945 --> 00:35:33,179
<i>And then when this Greyhound</i>
<i>player came at me,</i>

757
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,914
<i>I did this thing</i>
<i>called the deke.</i>

758
00:35:35,015 --> 00:35:37,149
<i>I faked to my left,</i>
<i>did a twirl,</i>

759
00:35:37,251 --> 00:35:38,585

<i>Goalie never even</i>

761

I have to say,

762
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:44,106
six games into this little
sports experiment,

763
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:46,158
I'm really enjoying
the experience.

764
00:35:46,259 --> 00:35:48,260
Wow. Hey,
that's incredible.

765
00:35:48,361 --> 00:35:50,463

Fitting in all right?

we live for whim,
we gorge on irrationality.

And we're
definitely not immune

780

to losing ourselves

Control the puck with

Oh, it's just a little
bit of metaphysics

I picked up when my

Is it possible to teach
me how to do that?

00:37:29,863 --> 00:37:31,680
Sure.
Yeah.

802
00:37:31,782 --> 00:37:32,782
Um, On a scale

 Could this really
be happening to me?

 I'm becoming part of

00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:04,079
 I'm definitely responding. 

814
00:38:04,181 --> 00:38:07,417


815
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:09,702
 We've never met anyone
like him before, 

816
00:38:09,803 --> 00:38:12,538
 but he's starting to grow
on us and he can score. 

817
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:15,841


818
00:38:15,943 --> 00:38:18,444
 Impossible question,
but I'll ask anyway. 

819
00:38:18,545 --> 00:38:22,514
 What car would you pick
if you didn't have to pay? 

820
00:38:22,616 --> 00:38:24,349
 Ooh! Ooh!
Ooh! 

821
00:38:24,451 --> 00:38:26,953
 One that is
environmentally friendly 

822
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:30,122
 Has the best conditions
for its employees. 

823
00:38:30,223 --> 00:38:31,958
<laughter>

824
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:33,593
What?

825
00:38:33,694 --> 00:38:35,878
 I did everything
I could to learn 

826
00:38:35,979 --> 00:38:38,514
 adolescent customs and
the Blades love earn. 

827
00:38:38,615 --> 00:38:39,999


828
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,000
<explosion>

829
00:38:41,101 --> 00:38:45,855
<laughter, cheering>

830
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:47,623
How big was it?

831
00:38:47,724 --> 00:38:50,109
 The embrace of the team
started to become 

832
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:52,862
 a second family
except way more fun. 

833
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:54,930
 It's amazing the
tricks one can do 

834
00:38:55,032 --> 00:38:57,432
 with a loaded gun. 

835
00:38:57,534 --> 00:38:59,334


836
00:38:59,435 --> 00:39:02,321
 Never met anyone
quite like him before. 

837
00:39:02,422 --> 00:39:03,556
 Now he's part of
the team and 

838
00:39:03,657 --> 00:39:05,441
 he's part of the core. 

839
00:39:05,542 --> 00:39:07,460


840
00:39:07,561 --> 00:39:09,962
 Is this really
what's transpiring 

841
00:39:10,063 --> 00:39:12,732
 on these bus trips? 

842
00:39:12,832 --> 00:39:16,101
 Whatever happened to
reading Aristotle's Poetics? 

843
00:39:16,202 --> 00:39:18,504


844
00:39:18,605 --> 00:39:20,038
 I guess I'm expanding 

845
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,440
 my party tricks. 

846
00:39:21,541 --> 00:39:24,343


847
00:39:24,444 --> 00:39:26,912
 Farley Gordon, you're
a star in every way. 

848
00:39:27,013 --> 00:39:29,665
 We're starting to like you
more and more each day. 

849
00:39:29,817 --> 00:39:38,508


850
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:41,026
 Gosh, I think
that turned out well. 

851
00:39:41,127 --> 00:39:43,629


852
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:44,797
<i> Are you okay? </i>

853
00:39:44,898 --> 00:39:47,066
 Those needles can
hurt like hell. 

854
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,417


855
00:39:48,518 --> 00:39:51,237
 Sometimes when I'm happy,
I start to cry. 

856
00:39:51,338 --> 00:39:54,006
 Does this now mean
I'm finally one of the guys? 

857
00:39:54,107 --> 00:39:57,042
 We all agree that you're
definitely not lame. 

858
00:39:57,143 --> 00:39:58,578


859
00:39:58,679 --> 00:39:59,812
 Whoa! 

860
00:39:59,913 --> 00:40:02,732
 Let's save the untoward
affection for the game. 

861
00:40:02,832 --> 00:40:06,502
 We'll race you
to the other end. 

862
00:40:06,603 --> 00:40:07,920


863

<i> 'Cause, wow,</i>

Men's Beauty,

870
00:40:30,943 --> 00:40:32,878

we use to establish

875
00:40:41,037 --> 00:40:43,072
One tastefully-shot commercial

your face lathered,

<i>to pimp their product.</i>

881
00:40:51,999 --> 00:40:53,766

<i>You don't even shave.</i>

I'm going to give you a
piece of advice.

884
00:40:58,288 --> 00:41:00,322
You're about to enter
a world where money

885
00:41:00,423 --> 00:41:03,259
overflows like the
Red River in spring.

<i>In this universe,</i>

Olaf, at work,
gave it to me.

897

Here, read
about your son.

898

You think there's
a chance that

So much to talk about.

Let's get right to it.

941
00:43:53,413 --> 00:43:56,281
How does it feel to go from
no one to number one

I don't pay any
attention to that.

The hype,

956
00:44:24,644 --> 00:44:25,878
suggest that you,
my friend,

00:44:25,979 --> 00:44:27,412

00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:17,713
<i>I got to tell you,</i>
<i>folks, Farley Gordon</i>

978
00:45:17,814 --> 00:45:19,949
<i>is certainly exposing</i>
<i>Jean Luc Pierre Henri</i>

979
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:22,117
<i>as the sieve that he is.</i>

980
00:45:22,218 --> 00:45:24,687
<i>Another three-goal performance</i>
<i>by the rookie sensation.</i>

981
00:45:24,787 --> 00:45:26,422
And, you know,
with each game

982
00:45:26,523 --> 00:45:28,624
the next one is further
cementing his reputation

983
00:45:28,725 --> 00:45:31,810
as the player most likely
to go tops in the draft.

984
00:45:31,911 --> 00:45:34,563


985
00:45:34,664 --> 00:45:38,500
<jungle sound effects>

986
00:45:38,601 --> 00:45:40,218
Yeah!

987
00:45:42,488 --> 00:45:43,572
<i>Let's go!</i>

988
00:45:43,673 --> 00:45:45,190
Let's go!
Help a brother out now.

989
00:45:45,291 --> 00:45:46,658
Everybody takes a man!

990
00:45:46,759 --> 00:45:47,859
Mess them up!

991
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:59,338


992
00:45:59,405 --> 00:46:17,789
 drumming 

993
00:46:17,891 --> 00:46:20,809
<crowd shouting>

994
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:27,149
<crowd booing>

995
00:46:33,439 --> 00:46:36,207
<grunting>

996
00:46:37,493 --> 00:46:40,930
<grunting>

997
00:47:04,136 --> 00:47:06,438
Nice fight there,
peacock.

998
00:47:08,041 --> 00:47:10,926
Do I have the floor?

999
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:13,261
What?

1000
00:47:13,396 --> 00:47:15,330
If I have the floor, I'd
like to defend my pacifism.

1001
00:47:15,431 --> 00:47:18,133
It's a decision I came
to after a lot of--

1002
00:47:18,234 --> 00:47:20,085
Ha ha!

1003
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:28,276
There's one rule.

1004
00:47:29,796 --> 00:47:32,547
<i>One rule only.</i>

1005
00:47:32,648 --> 00:47:35,334
When someone is trying
to take your head off,

1006
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:36,901
you don't roll
over on the ice,

1007
00:47:37,003 --> 00:47:38,903
cover your ears and
cry like a baby.

1008
00:47:40,657 --> 00:47:41,756
You...

1009
00:47:41,857 --> 00:47:43,291
hit back!

1010
00:47:43,393 --> 00:47:45,193
You...

1011
00:47:46,962 --> 00:47:50,099
defend your honour!

1012
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,117
Our honour!

1013
00:47:56,372 --> 00:47:59,107
At least we were respected
before you arrived.

1014
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:09,234
 Forgive me for asking, 

1015
00:48:09,335 --> 00:48:12,554
 for not seeing the light. 

1016
00:48:12,655 --> 00:48:14,272
<i> But what's</i>
<i>so shameful about </i>

1017
00:48:14,374 --> 00:48:17,575
 not wanting to fight? 

1018
00:48:17,626 --> 00:48:20,045
 It's part of the game. 

1019
00:48:20,146 --> 00:48:22,581
 It's part of the code. 

1020
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:25,017
 When someone challenges
<i>your manhood, </i>

1021
00:48:25,118 --> 00:48:27,569
 you go toe-to-toe. 

1022
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:29,555


1023
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:31,423
 But what does that
have to do with hockey? 

1024
00:48:31,524 --> 00:48:33,992
 I still don't understand. 

1025
00:48:34,093 --> 00:48:36,495
 How do fisticuffs
equate to... 

1026
00:48:36,596 --> 00:48:38,997
<i> being a man? </i>

1027
00:48:39,098 --> 00:48:44,436


1028
00:48:44,537 --> 00:48:46,505
 On the ice I've always
had your back. 

1029
00:48:46,606 --> 00:48:48,574
 If they mess with you,
they get a whack. 

1030
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:50,809
 If that don't
help them comprende 

1031
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:53,295
 the knuckle sandwich
comes into play. 

1032
00:48:53,396 --> 00:48:55,280
 You see, I drop the gloves
when it's required. 

1033
00:48:55,415 --> 00:48:57,432
 That's the
reason I was hired. 

1034
00:48:57,533 --> 00:48:59,617
 I don't make
fancy passes. 

1035
00:48:59,719 --> 00:49:02,187
<i> I right wrongs</i>
<i>by kicking asses. </i>

1036
00:49:02,288 --> 00:49:04,122
 Without me,
most would agree, 

1037
00:49:04,223 --> 00:49:07,726
 The game would
devolve into anarchy. 

1038
00:49:07,827 --> 00:49:09,127
 Devolve? 

1039
00:49:09,228 --> 00:49:10,695
 What does that mean? 

1040
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:12,614
 A brawler on ice,
I won't lie. 

1041
00:49:12,715 --> 00:49:14,916
 But away from the rink
I'm a sensitive guy. 

1042
00:49:15,018 --> 00:49:17,085
 I'm not afraid to
show a feminine side. 

1043
00:49:17,186 --> 00:49:20,022
 In fact, during
"The Notebook" I cried -- 

1044
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:23,291
 Twice!
It's pathetic. 

1045
00:49:23,392 --> 00:49:25,711
<i> All of these duties</i>
<i>I'm happy to perform, </i>

1046
00:49:25,812 --> 00:49:29,214
 But I can't watch out for
someone who won't conform -- 

1047
00:49:29,315 --> 00:49:33,468
 To the code! 

1048
00:49:33,569 --> 00:49:36,755
 To the code! 

1049
00:49:36,873 --> 00:49:38,907
 So stop bending over.
Fight like a man. 

1050
00:49:39,008 --> 00:49:41,209
 Just take one swing
and we'll be a band -- 

1051
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:45,180
 Of brothers!
Of brothers! 

1052
00:49:45,281 --> 00:49:47,149
 Telling war stories 'til 

1053
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:50,335
 we're a hundred and three. 

1054
00:49:50,436 --> 00:49:54,189
<i> Boys, if I wanted to fight,</i>
<i>I'd join the MMA. </i>

1055
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:59,027
 But hockey's the game
I love to play. 

1056
00:49:59,128 --> 00:50:02,247
 Is he even
Canadian, eh? 

1057
00:50:03,683 --> 00:50:05,150
 Why does an
anti-violence stand 

1058
00:50:05,251 --> 00:50:07,669
 make me less of a man? 

1059
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:09,604
 In fact, last time
the doctor checked 

1060
00:50:09,705 --> 00:50:12,074
 my testosterone
was up to spec. 

1061
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:15,994


1062
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:18,330
 Because we eat, 

1063
00:50:18,431 --> 00:50:19,731
 we play, 

1064
00:50:19,832 --> 00:50:21,733
 we shower together. 

1065
00:50:21,834 --> 00:50:23,868
 We go in the corners. 

1066
00:50:23,969 --> 00:50:27,005
 We'll be friends forever. 

1067
00:50:27,106 --> 00:50:31,109
 And forever. 

1068
00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:34,179


1069
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,081
 By refusing to fight, 

1070
00:50:36,182 --> 00:50:38,250
 we can no longer guarantee 

1071
00:50:38,351 --> 00:50:39,868
 that around the ice 

1072
00:50:39,969 --> 00:50:42,654
 you can skate
with impunity. 

1073
00:50:42,755 --> 00:50:44,422
 No one's
expecting you to 

1074
00:50:44,524 --> 00:50:46,625
 punch out
someone's lights. 

1075
00:50:46,726 --> 00:50:48,393
 Just take a
few swings

1076
00:50:48,494 --> 00:50:50,963
 and it'll be all right. 

1077
00:50:51,063 --> 00:50:52,847
 But until you do, 

1078
00:50:52,948 --> 00:50:55,250
 there's a line
in the sand. 

1079
00:50:55,351 --> 00:50:56,868
 You might be
on the team, 

1080
00:50:56,969 --> 00:50:59,404
 but you aren't a
part of this band... 

1081
00:50:59,505 --> 00:51:01,690
 Of brothers!

1082
00:51:01,791 --> 00:51:03,992
Oh,
brothers!

1083
00:51:04,093 --> 00:51:08,797
 United we'll be
'til eternity 

1084
00:51:08,881 --> 00:51:12,417
 Brothers!
Oh, brothers! 

1085
00:51:12,519 --> 00:51:14,553
 Telling war stories 'til 

1086
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:18,890
 we're a hundred and three. 

1087
00:51:18,991 --> 00:51:28,599


1088
00:51:34,773 --> 00:51:37,042
Look, I don't like the fighting
<i>any more than you do...</i>

1089
00:51:37,143 --> 00:51:39,394
...but that's not
why I play the game.

1090
00:51:39,496 --> 00:51:41,730
Farley, that's
like saying

1091
00:51:41,831 --> 00:51:43,682
the KKK are a
swell bunch of guys

1092
00:51:43,783 --> 00:51:46,785
except for their views
on African-Americans.

1093
00:51:47,053 --> 00:51:49,321
I think you're
overreacting.

1094
00:51:49,422 --> 00:51:51,256
Besides, aren't you
proud of how Farley

1095
00:51:51,357 --> 00:51:52,924
stood up for himself?

1096
00:51:54,877 --> 00:51:56,778
our father and I have
discussed the matter

1097
00:51:56,879 --> 00:51:59,547
and we feel it's in
everybody's best interests

1098
00:51:59,648 --> 00:52:01,783
if you quit
<i>the team.</i>

1099
00:52:01,884 --> 00:52:03,185
Did you ever think that
I might like to be

1100
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:04,652
an active participant

1101
00:52:04,753 --> 00:52:06,488
in your little
tte--tte?

1102
00:52:06,589 --> 00:52:09,391
Sarcasm,
it's so teenager-ly.

1103
00:52:09,492 --> 00:52:11,593
Farley,
it's cheap.

1104
00:52:11,694 --> 00:52:12,578
Yeah.

1105
00:52:12,679 --> 00:52:15,013
Well,
so is talk.

1106
00:52:17,867 --> 00:52:25,924


1107
00:52:26,025 --> 00:52:30,361
 Is it me or my
parents who is right? 

1108
00:52:30,463 --> 00:52:33,598
 One of us is clearly
not seeing the light. 

1109
00:52:33,699 --> 00:52:37,035
 I thought I had it all,
all figured out. 

1110
00:52:37,136 --> 00:52:41,005
 Now everything
seems so in doubt. 

1111
00:52:41,106 --> 00:52:44,776


1112
00:52:44,877 --> 00:52:45,811
 Farley Gordon, 

1113
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:48,012
 you should always
follow your heart. 

1114
00:52:48,113 --> 00:52:51,766


1115
00:52:51,868 --> 00:52:54,636
 Yeah, I once
took that advice, 

1116
00:52:54,737 --> 00:52:57,205
 now everything's
falling apart. 

1117
00:52:57,306 --> 00:53:11,586


1118
00:53:11,687 --> 00:53:12,870
Play that tape again.

1119
00:53:13,139 --> 00:53:15,139
I don't care if you're one
of the greatest players

1120
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:17,241
to ever lace up
a pair of skates --

1121
00:53:17,343 --> 00:53:18,910
defend your honour.

1122
00:53:19,011 --> 00:53:21,646
Farley Gordon has come out
and said that he's a pacifist?

1123
00:53:21,747 --> 00:53:22,880
Ha!

1124
00:53:22,981 --> 00:53:24,982
I think that there's
another 'P' word

1125
00:53:25,083 --> 00:53:27,084
that is more appropriate.

1126
00:53:27,186 --> 00:53:28,920
We'll be back.

1127
00:53:29,021 --> 00:53:31,072
<i>See, in Canada, we tend to</i>
<i>like our hockey players</i>

1128
00:53:31,173 --> 00:53:34,075
served with a
good helping of macho.

1129
00:53:34,176 --> 00:53:35,710
And ever since
your non-fight,

1130
00:53:35,811 --> 00:53:37,796
your testosterone-
to-estrogen ratio,

1131
00:53:37,897 --> 00:53:40,065
<i>it's been</i>
<i>put into question.</i>

1132
00:53:40,166 --> 00:53:41,733
<i>Trust me.</i>

1133
00:53:41,834 --> 00:53:43,751
The offers are going
to start coming in

1134
00:53:43,852 --> 00:53:45,620
once you kick the
ass in masculine.

1135
00:53:45,721 --> 00:53:47,271


1136

Oh!

1140
00:53:54,013 --> 00:54:05,173

<i>If they won't</i>

1144
00:54:12,365 --> 00:54:14,399
<i>how can you call</i>
<i>them team mates?</i>

1145
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:16,535
Maybe you should reconsider
your friendship.

1146
00:54:16,636 --> 00:54:18,069
Honestly,
they're just a little

1147
00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:19,938
misguided
about fighting.

1148
00:54:20,039 --> 00:54:22,674
I think eventually
they'll come around.

1149
00:54:25,361 --> 00:54:26,428
Eve, there's
something I've wanted

1150
00:54:26,529 --> 00:54:28,430
to talk to you
about for awhile now.

1151
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:33,535
Of course,
Farley.

1152
00:54:37,189 --> 00:54:39,157
I don't know
where to start.

1153
00:54:42,278 --> 00:54:45,080
Please don't take this
the wrong way, okay?

1154
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:48,567
Oh, God,
this is embarrassing

1155
00:54:48,668 --> 00:54:50,235
<i>but I'm going</i>
<i>to say it anyway.</i>

1156
00:54:53,005 --> 00:54:56,608
Being a Blade
has made me realize

1157
00:54:56,709 --> 00:54:57,842
just how isolated
I've been.

1158
00:54:57,944 --> 00:55:00,245
Like, maybe my parents
are just not as cool

1159
00:55:00,346 --> 00:55:01,729
as I once thought
<i>they were.</i>

1160
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,034
Farley,
they were vegans,

1161
00:55:06,135 --> 00:55:07,769
environmentalists
and Yo-Yo Ma fans

1162
00:55:07,870 --> 00:55:09,687
before it
was fashionable.

1163
00:55:09,788 --> 00:55:11,656
And now you're
defending my parents?

1164
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:15,543
Whose side are you on anyway?

1165
00:55:15,644 --> 00:55:16,944
They reject anything
that even has

1166
00:55:17,046 --> 00:55:17,945
a whiff of mainstream

1167
00:55:18,047 --> 00:55:19,147
before they
give it a chance.

1168
00:55:19,248 --> 00:55:20,581
I am sick of
being different.

1169
00:55:20,682 --> 00:55:22,083
<i>What is wrong</i>
<i>with fitting in?</i>

1170
00:55:22,184 --> 00:55:24,352
Anyone can fit in.

1171
00:55:24,453 --> 00:55:26,654
Different, now that
takes imagination.

1172
00:55:26,755 --> 00:55:28,039
Does it?
Or is it a crutch?

1173
00:55:32,144 --> 00:55:33,528
<sneezes>

1174
00:55:33,629 --> 00:55:35,697
Bless you.

1175
00:55:35,798 --> 00:55:37,332
Are you wearing
cologne?

1176
00:55:37,433 --> 00:55:38,817
Yeah.

1177
00:55:38,918 --> 00:55:40,485
And this stuff isn't
even on the market yet.

1178
00:55:40,586 --> 00:55:42,186
My agent wants to make sure
that if I do go Number One

1179
00:55:42,287 --> 00:55:43,922
there's a scent
that I can stand by.

1180
00:55:45,891 --> 00:55:48,226
<sneezes>

1181
00:55:48,327 --> 00:55:51,396
Farley, I have a severe
fragrance allergy.

1182
00:55:52,798 --> 00:55:55,533
I thought you knew that.

1183
00:55:55,535 --> 00:55:58,052
Guess I forgot.

1184
00:55:58,153 --> 00:56:00,004
You know what
else you forgot?

1185
00:56:00,105 --> 00:56:01,573
My birthday.

1186
00:56:01,674 --> 00:56:03,341
It was yesterday.

1187
00:56:03,442 --> 00:56:04,476
Oh, Eve,
I'm--

1188
00:56:04,577 --> 00:56:06,027
<i>I shouldn't have even</i>
<i>mentioned it, Farley.</i>

1189
00:56:06,128 --> 00:56:08,363
Honestly,
I could care less.

1190
00:56:08,464 --> 00:56:11,500
Birthdays are
overrated anyway.

1191
00:56:11,601 --> 00:56:13,852
<i>People change,</i>
<i>priorities shift.</i>

1192
00:56:13,953 --> 00:56:16,421

00:56:36,792 --> 00:56:39,394


1198
00:56:39,495 --> 00:56:40,745
<i>Come on,</i>
<i>Mama's boy.</i>

1199
00:56:40,829 --> 00:56:41,663
Ow!
Hey!

1200
00:56:41,764 --> 00:56:43,381
Leave me alone,
ass-face!

1201
00:56:43,383 --> 00:56:44,665
What are you going
to do about it, huh?

1202
00:56:46,635 --> 00:56:47,702
Come on.
Come on, kid.

1203
00:56:55,027 --> 00:56:56,844
What?

1204
00:56:56,945 --> 00:56:57,928
It's a quotation
from Ghandi.

1205
00:56:58,030 --> 00:56:59,631
You should look it up.

1206
00:57:02,318 --> 00:57:03,618
Damn it!

1207
00:57:03,719 --> 00:57:09,124


1208
00:57:09,225 --> 00:57:11,526
 Farley,
we love you. 

1209
00:57:11,627 --> 00:57:14,429
 But this has gone on
way too long. 

1210
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:16,631
 Stop being stubborn 

1211
00:57:16,732 --> 00:57:19,667
 and just admit
that you were wrong. 

1212
00:57:19,768 --> 00:57:23,371
 Joining the team
was a huge mistake. 

1213
00:57:23,472 --> 00:57:25,056
 Huge mistake. 

1214
00:57:25,157 --> 00:57:27,391
 It's made you miserable 

1215
00:57:27,492 --> 00:57:29,661
<i> and caused you</i>
<i>to forsake... </i>

1216
00:57:29,762 --> 00:57:32,614
<i> Your ideals</i>
<i>and your passion. </i>

1217
00:57:32,715 --> 00:57:36,150
 Your inner joy,
inner joy. 

1218
00:57:36,251 --> 00:57:39,403
<i> This behaviour is</i>
<i>making you </i>

1219
00:57:39,504 --> 00:57:40,872
 an ordinary boy. 

1220
00:57:40,973 --> 00:57:44,609
 Ordinary boy. 

1221
00:57:44,710 --> 00:57:46,143
<i> An ordinary boy. </i>

1222

1224
00:57:51,183 --> 00:57:55,520
 Yeah, just whose ideals
were they anyway? 

1225
00:57:55,621 --> 00:57:56,721
 What do you mean? 

1226
00:57:56,822 --> 00:58:00,358
<i> I was never asked,</i>
<i>I never had a say. </i>

1227
00:58:00,459 --> 00:58:02,160
 Is this a dream? 

1228
00:58:02,261 --> 00:58:04,295
 It's in your
best interests 

1229
00:58:04,396 --> 00:58:07,115
 to exercise our
parental rights. 

1230
00:58:07,216 --> 00:58:09,667
 And order you
to quit hockey 

1231
00:58:09,768 --> 00:58:11,603
 to restore... 

1232
00:58:11,704 --> 00:58:13,905
 your inner light. 

1233
00:58:14,006 --> 00:58:15,990
Stop!

1234
00:58:16,091 --> 00:58:17,759
Stop!

1235
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:21,179
<i> Stop! I won't hear</i>
<i>another single word </i>

1236
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:24,983
 about hockey being
boorish and absurd. 

1237
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:26,117
 Ordinary boy. 

1238
00:58:26,218 --> 00:58:28,152
<i> News flash I don't</i>
<i>want to be like you </i>

1239
00:58:28,253 --> 00:58:30,255
<i> Ordinary boy. </i>
 when I grow up 

1240
00:58:30,356 --> 00:58:33,191
<i> Elitism and arrogance just</i>
<i>isn't my cup of destiny. </i>

1241
00:58:33,292 --> 00:58:34,625
 Ordinary boy. 

1242
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:37,312
 And now this conversation
is officially off-limits . 

1243
00:58:37,413 --> 00:58:38,379
<i> Ordinary boy. </i>

1246
00:58:55,163 --> 00:58:57,632
Let Marco be honest.
Your G-string playing --

1247
00:58:57,733 --> 00:59:00,018
<i>pure religion.</i>

1248
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:01,852
Marco has written,

1249
00:59:01,953 --> 00:59:04,472
how you say,
a regalo?

1250
00:59:04,574 --> 00:59:06,741
Oh,
a gift to you

1251
00:59:06,842 --> 00:59:08,577

1252
00:59:08,678 --> 00:59:12,246
No...

1253
00:59:12,347 --> 00:59:13,748

 piano 

1255
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:24,175
 You ask me if I love you 

1256
00:59:24,276 --> 00:59:30,515
<i> and I choke on my reply. </i>

1257
00:59:30,616 --> 00:59:36,888
 I'd rather
hurt you honestly 

1258
00:59:36,989 --> 00:59:42,260
<i> than mislead</i>
<i>you with a lie. </i>

1260
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:52,937
You didn't write that.

1261
00:59:53,038 --> 00:59:55,806
Assurdo!
Of course Marco did.

1262
00:59:55,875 --> 00:59:58,893
No, you didn't.
It's a Dan Hill song.

1263
00:59:58,995 --> 01:00:01,412
My parents danced to
it at their wedding.

1264
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:03,314
They're divorced.

1265
01:00:03,415 --> 01:00:04,549
No.

1266
01:00:04,650 --> 01:00:06,684
No, no, no,
it is not.

1267
01:00:08,504 --> 01:00:12,106
 And sometimes
when we touch 

1268
01:00:12,207 --> 01:00:15,242
<i> the honesty's too much. </i>

1269

<i> And I have</i>

1271
01:00:21,033 --> 01:00:24,869

1280
01:00:57,586 --> 01:01:00,154
You think Marco does not

01:01:21,576 --> 01:01:23,677
The ragazzo?

1289
01:01:23,778 --> 01:01:27,282
He's more him than

 What is happening to me? 

1292
01:01:43,882 --> 01:01:47,985
 Was it only weeks ago
that I was carefree? 

1293
01:01:48,086 --> 01:01:51,605
 Life was simple.
Life was easy. 

1294
01:01:51,706 --> 01:01:55,592
 Seeing Eve with Marco
made me queasy. 

1295
01:01:55,694 --> 01:02:00,031
<i> I Never imagined that I</i>

01:02:03,169 --> 01:02:04,903
 That weren't all chaste. 

1298
01:02:05,004 --> 01:02:08,606
 That weren't exactly
all pure. 

1299
01:02:08,707 --> 01:02:10,842


1300
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:12,777
 Eve's my soul mate. 

1301
01:02:12,878 --> 01:02:14,312
 Isn't it ironic? 

1302
01:02:14,413 --> 01:02:16,380
 Eve's my soul mate. 

1303
01:02:16,481 --> 01:02:19,317
 I wish that it
wasn't platonic. 

1304
01:02:19,418 --> 01:02:20,584


1305
01:02:20,853 --> 01:02:24,572
 You were always the
boy in the bubble. 

1306
01:02:24,673 --> 01:02:28,342
 Reality gave,
gave you trouble. 

1307
01:02:28,444 --> 01:02:32,029
<i> So you've got some feelings</i>
<i>for your best friend. </i>

1308
01:02:32,130 --> 01:02:35,716
 Let her know,
the world won't end. 

1309
01:02:35,817 --> 01:02:39,320
 Please, Eve's like
a sister to me. 

1310
01:02:39,421 --> 01:02:41,289
 These feelings
are creeping, 

1311
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:43,691
 creeping into
impropriety. 

1312
01:02:43,792 --> 01:02:47,161
 Last time I checked,
you're not related. 

1313
01:02:47,262 --> 01:02:51,081
 Don't deny it.
Don't debate it. 

1314
01:02:51,182 --> 01:02:54,235
 Maybe the girl wants
to get freaky with you. 

1315
01:02:54,336 --> 01:02:56,603
 Who knows? She wants
to squeeze your bones. 

1316
01:02:56,704 --> 01:02:58,605
 She wants to
rub your nose. 

1317
01:02:58,706 --> 01:03:02,159
 Boys, thanks for the
female insights, 

1318
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:03,394
 but,
trust me, 

1319
01:03:03,495 --> 01:03:06,731
 Eve doesn't want to
turn out the lights. 

1320
01:03:06,832 --> 01:03:08,766
 You've got to man up
with your woman 

1321
01:03:08,867 --> 01:03:10,067
 and hockey fights. 

1322
01:03:10,168 --> 01:03:13,888
 I swear that you'll start
sleeping better at night. 

1323
01:03:13,989 --> 01:03:15,823
 Speaking of sleep, 

1324
01:03:15,924 --> 01:03:18,392
 I've got
to go to bed. 

1325
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:21,612


1326
01:03:21,713 --> 01:03:23,414
 Honestly,
Farley, 

1327
01:03:23,515 --> 01:03:27,652
 try and get your
ass out of your head. 

1328
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:41,515
<i>Hey,</i>
<i>Farley.</i>

1329
01:03:41,616 --> 01:03:43,684
Are you coming to
my recital tomorrow?

1330
01:03:45,354 --> 01:03:47,821
I can't.
I've got stuff to do.

1331
01:03:47,922 --> 01:03:49,190
But you've never
missed one yet.

1332
01:03:49,291 --> 01:03:50,924
You're my
good luck charm.

1333
01:03:51,026 --> 01:03:52,626
Well,
I'm sure you'll be fine,

1334
01:03:52,727 --> 01:03:55,029
especially with Marco
there by your side.

1335
01:03:55,130 --> 01:03:56,397
What's that
supposed to mean?

1336
01:03:56,498 --> 01:03:58,265
Nothing.

1337
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:00,251
Come on,
Farley.

1338
01:04:00,352 --> 01:04:01,786
I know you
better than that.

1339
01:04:01,887 --> 01:04:03,537
Honestly,
nothing.

1340
01:04:03,638 --> 01:04:06,223
You two make
a great couple.

1341
01:04:06,325 --> 01:04:10,978
 Sarcasm really doesn't
suit you that well. 

1342
01:04:11,079 --> 01:04:13,848
<i> What's with</i>
<i>the attitude? </i>

1343
01:04:13,949 --> 01:04:16,200
 Hey,
what the hell? 

1344
01:04:16,335 --> 01:04:18,802
 You say you don't
have any feelings 

1345
01:04:18,903 --> 01:04:20,938
 for that
Italian fellow. 

1346
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:24,142
 So why did I catch you
playing tonsil hockey 

1347
01:04:24,243 --> 01:04:26,144
<i> instead of the cello? </i>

1348
01:04:26,245 --> 01:04:30,814
 Farley, you're making
an awful mistake 

1349
01:04:30,915 --> 01:04:36,020
 To him, I did not my
heart and saliva forsake. 

1350
01:04:36,155 --> 01:04:38,605
 Eve,
I was there. 

1351
01:04:38,706 --> 01:04:41,042
 I saw what I saw. 

1352
01:04:41,143 --> 01:04:44,946
 The passion was real. 

1353
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:47,148
<i> The passion was raw. </i>

1354
01:04:47,282 --> 01:04:51,135


1355
01:04:51,236 --> 01:04:55,940
 What does it
matter to you anyway? 

1356
01:04:56,041 --> 01:05:00,712
 What, oh what,
do you want me to say? 

1357
01:05:00,813 --> 01:05:05,850
 I won't defend myself
or my reputation. 

1358
01:05:05,951 --> 01:05:07,952
 If you're
calling me a liar 

1359
01:05:08,053 --> 01:05:11,188
 let's end
this conversation. 

1360
01:05:11,256 --> 01:05:15,943
 Fine, if that's
how it's going to be 

1361
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:21,115
<i> I have nothing more to</i>
<i>add to your hypocrisy. </i>

1362
01:05:21,216 --> 01:05:26,020
 Farley, I don't understand
who you've become. 

1363
01:05:26,121 --> 01:05:28,339
<i> The boy that I once knew </i>

1364
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:30,975
<i> is dead and done. </i>

1365
01:05:31,076 --> 01:05:33,294
 The boy that I once knew 

1366
01:05:33,395 --> 01:05:36,197
 is dead and done. 

1367
01:05:36,298 --> 01:05:38,199
 The boy that I once knew 

1368
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:42,570
<i> is dead and done. </i>

1369
01:05:44,239 --> 01:05:52,613


1370
01:05:52,714 --> 01:05:55,867
<grunting>

1371
01:05:55,869 --> 01:05:59,903


1372
01:06:00,004 --> 01:06:03,207
 Back off, buddy!
Leave me alone! 

1373
01:06:03,308 --> 01:06:04,508
 What are you going
to do about it? 

1374
01:06:04,610 --> 01:06:06,043
 Write a poem? 

1375
01:06:06,144 --> 01:06:10,431


1376
01:06:10,532 --> 01:06:12,000
<whistle>

1377
01:06:12,101 --> 01:06:14,202
 I hate this game.
I hate my life. 

1378
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:15,903


1379
01:06:15,954 --> 01:06:18,689
 If you won't fight,
get off this ice. 

1380
01:06:18,790 --> 01:06:20,057
<jeering>

1381
01:06:20,158 --> 01:06:22,359
Drop him!

1382
01:06:22,461 --> 01:06:24,462
Fight!
Come on!

1383
01:06:24,662 --> 01:06:26,530
Hey!
Hit him!

1384
01:06:26,631 --> 01:06:28,249
Fight him!

1385
01:06:28,350 --> 01:06:30,017
You ready?

1386
01:06:30,118 --> 01:06:35,506
 I'm jonesing to unleash
these fists of fury. 

1387
01:06:35,607 --> 01:06:40,828
 Rope-a-dope display
of fighting flurry! 

1388
01:06:44,466 --> 01:06:46,200
 Let's go! 

1389
01:06:46,301 --> 01:06:47,368


1390
01:06:47,469 --> 01:06:49,520
<cheering>

1391
01:06:49,522 --> 01:06:50,854
Get him!

1392
01:06:50,955 --> 01:06:52,623


1393
01:06:52,724 --> 01:06:53,691
<screaming>

1394
01:06:53,792 --> 01:06:55,459
 It's on, let's go.
We're going toe-to-toe. 

1395
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:57,995
 It's on, let's go.
We're going toe-to-toe. 

1396
01:06:58,096 --> 01:07:00,281
 My goodness! 

1397
01:07:00,382 --> 01:07:04,484
 Why did I ever
doubt that boy? 

1398
01:07:04,636 --> 01:07:06,520
<i> This is a watershed moment</i>

1399
01:07:06,621 --> 01:07:09,973
 of happiness and joy. 

1400
01:07:10,074 --> 01:07:12,409
<i> With that punch</i>
<i>the sky's the limit. </i>

1401
01:07:12,510 --> 01:07:15,529
 Think I swallowed
my bicuspid. 

1402
01:07:15,630 --> 01:07:19,333
 Everything's gone
seriously awry. 

1403
01:07:19,434 --> 01:07:21,685
 Oh oh Honey, 

1404
01:07:21,786 --> 01:07:25,523
 I'm so sad
I can't even cry. 

1405
01:07:25,624 --> 01:07:29,493
<grunting>

1406
01:07:33,498 --> 01:07:38,369


1407
01:07:38,470 --> 01:07:40,804
 Who is this person, 

1408
01:07:40,872 --> 01:07:43,490
 this person
in such a rage? 

1409
01:07:43,591 --> 01:07:45,760
 I've become a stranger 

1410
01:07:45,861 --> 01:07:49,630
 to myself on this stage. 

1411
01:07:49,731 --> 01:07:51,999
 It's no excuse. 

1412
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:54,701
 I know that for sure. 

1413
01:07:54,803 --> 01:07:56,837
 But being one of the boys 

1414
01:07:56,938 --> 01:08:00,540
 held a surprising allure. 

1415
01:08:00,642 --> 01:08:04,278
 It's clear that I have
lost myself in this game. 

1416
01:08:04,379 --> 01:08:06,080


1417
01:08:06,181 --> 01:08:08,816
 This person before me
is Farley Gordon 

1418
01:08:08,917 --> 01:08:11,718
 only in name. 

1419
01:08:11,820 --> 01:08:18,625


1420
01:08:18,726 --> 01:08:20,861
 These cheers are hollow. 

1421
01:08:20,962 --> 01:08:23,530
 They are in vain. 

1422
01:08:23,631 --> 01:08:25,199
 Forcing my resolve 

1423
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:29,270
 never to
play hockey again. 

1424
01:08:29,370 --> 01:08:31,438
 Where are you going? 

1425
01:08:31,539 --> 01:08:34,741
 I want to hug
you with pride. 

1426
01:08:34,843 --> 01:08:37,778
 Back where I belong... 

1427
01:08:37,879 --> 01:08:40,414
 Outside. 

1428
01:08:40,515 --> 01:09:07,275


1429
01:09:07,376 --> 01:09:10,344
I'd like to
sincerely apologize

1430
01:09:10,445 --> 01:09:13,113
to everybody
who supported me.

1431
01:09:13,214 --> 01:09:15,566
It's now official.
Farley Gordon,

1432
01:09:15,667 --> 01:09:17,702
<i>that teen sensation we've</i>
<i>been telling you about,</i>

1433
01:09:17,803 --> 01:09:19,653
<i>well, he has now</i>
<i>announced that</i>

1434
01:09:19,754 --> 01:09:21,087
<i>he's quitting hockey.</i>

1435
01:09:21,973 --> 01:09:23,441
Ugh!

1436
01:09:24,742 --> 01:09:33,267


1437
01:09:38,924 --> 01:09:41,292
Marco.

1438
01:09:42,327 --> 01:09:45,146
My soul has
heavy weather.

1439
01:09:45,247 --> 01:09:47,348
Why?
What's wrong?

1440
01:09:47,449 --> 01:09:48,749
<i>I ache for</i>
<i>my true blossom.</i>

1441
01:09:48,850 --> 01:09:51,218
Please don't
talk about Eve.

1442
01:09:51,336 --> 01:09:53,253
No,
is sole Italiana.

1443
01:09:53,354 --> 01:09:55,256
But I saw
you two kissing.

1444
01:09:55,357 --> 01:09:56,457
<i>Where?</i>

1445
01:09:56,558 --> 01:09:58,459
At the
rehearsal space.

1446
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:01,128
<i>Pfft! No, Marco</i>
<i>tried to kiss Eve,</i>

1447
01:10:01,229 --> 01:10:03,464
but she spit out
my advance like

1448
01:10:03,565 --> 01:10:05,099
wine from the box.

1449
01:10:06,968 --> 01:10:08,536
Really?

1450
01:10:08,636 --> 01:10:11,739
<i>Even now,</i>
<i>voicing it aloud,</i>

1451
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:13,841
it seems so...

1452
01:10:13,942 --> 01:10:15,843
so incredible.

1453
01:10:19,014 --> 01:10:22,049
<Italian>

1454
01:10:22,150 --> 01:10:24,485


1455
01:10:24,586 --> 01:10:28,722
 You ask me
if I love you. 

1456
01:10:28,823 --> 01:10:33,194
 And I choke
on my reply. 

1457
01:10:33,295 --> 01:10:39,950


1458
01:10:40,051 --> 01:10:49,176
<news caster in background>

1459
01:10:49,278 --> 01:10:56,049


1460
01:10:56,151 --> 01:10:58,252
 What has happened? 

1461
01:10:58,353 --> 01:11:01,054
 Why can't I concentrate? 

1462
01:11:01,156 --> 01:11:03,391
 Aristotle is Aris-Notle. 

1463
01:11:03,492 --> 01:11:06,059
 Socrates is not
worth the debate. 

1464
01:11:06,161 --> 01:11:08,296
 philosophy used to be 

1465
01:11:08,397 --> 01:11:11,231
 jet fuel for my brain 

1466
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:12,833
 Now reading a page 

1467
01:11:12,934 --> 01:11:16,370
 is positively Herculean. 

1468
01:11:16,471 --> 01:11:21,776


1469
01:11:21,876 --> 01:11:23,277
 Since I quit, 

1470
01:11:23,378 --> 01:11:26,547
 the game obviously
holds no allure. 

1471
01:11:26,648 --> 01:11:31,735


1472
01:11:31,836 --> 01:11:33,403
 But for my blues,

1473
01:11:33,504 --> 01:11:36,741
 even art doesn't
offer a cure. 

1474
01:11:36,842 --> 01:11:42,412


1475
01:11:42,513 --> 01:11:46,950
<i> How did I ever</i>
<i>become so vain? </i>

1476
01:11:47,219 --> 01:11:52,640
<i> Could modelling underwear</i>
<i>be any more lame? </i>

1477
01:11:52,740 --> 01:12:00,047


1478
01:12:00,148 --> 01:12:02,316
<i> Eve,</i>
<i>oh, Eve. </i>

1479
01:12:02,417 --> 01:12:05,152
 How I miss her so. 

1480
01:12:05,253 --> 01:12:09,156
 But I can't find a way
past our current embargo. 

1481
01:12:09,257 --> 01:12:10,757


1482
01:12:10,858 --> 01:12:12,193
 I try to
remain positive, 

1483
01:12:12,294 --> 01:12:15,462
 But I lose hope
she'll be gone forever. 

1484
01:12:15,564 --> 01:12:17,698
 I wish she'd
give me a call 

1485
01:12:17,799 --> 01:12:20,167
 or send me a letter. 

1486
01:12:20,268 --> 01:12:30,043


1487
01:12:30,144 --> 01:12:32,145
 My world which
once seemed so full 

1488
01:12:32,247 --> 01:12:34,515
 of music and light 

1489
01:12:34,616 --> 01:12:37,751
 has been reduced
to a monochrome 

1490
01:12:37,852 --> 01:12:39,687
 black and white. 

1491
01:12:39,787 --> 01:12:49,530


1492
01:12:49,631 --> 01:12:51,381
<i> He sleeps all day. </i>

1493
01:12:51,483 --> 01:12:54,200
 He's no longer engaged. 

1494
01:12:54,301 --> 01:12:56,520
<i> My diagnosis: </i>

1495
01:12:56,621 --> 01:12:59,006
 Adolescent malaise. 

1496
01:12:59,107 --> 01:13:01,475
 Is there a cure? 

1497
01:13:01,576 --> 01:13:04,111
 Anything we can do? 

1498
01:13:04,212 --> 01:13:06,646
 Well, hopefully,
he'll grow out of it 

1499
01:13:06,748 --> 01:13:09,016
 in a year or two. 

1500
01:13:09,117 --> 01:13:30,187


1501
01:13:30,288 --> 01:13:31,722
Oh,
son.

1502
01:13:35,426 --> 01:13:39,396
Farley, we've made a
huge parenting mistake.

1503
01:13:41,465 --> 01:13:43,834
<i>All we wanted was for you</i>

1504
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:46,586
<i>to find your inner utopia.</i>

1505
01:13:46,687 --> 01:13:50,057
And if hockey
was that utopia then

1506
01:13:50,158 --> 01:13:52,960
we should have
opened the gates.

1507
01:13:53,061 --> 01:13:55,296
And,
instead,

1508
01:13:55,397 --> 01:13:58,732
we threw away the
keys to the kingdom.

1509
01:13:58,833 --> 01:14:00,684
Well, you saw what
happened on the ice.

1510
01:14:00,785 --> 01:14:02,519
What I did,
what I became.

1511
01:14:02,620 --> 01:14:05,589
<i>True,</i>
<i>the violence was ugly</i>

1512
01:14:05,891 --> 01:14:07,575
but where we failed
was in helping you

1513
01:14:07,676 --> 01:14:10,177
to navigate the nasty,

1514
01:14:10,278 --> 01:14:12,179
to sidestep the savagery,

1515
01:14:12,481 --> 01:14:14,264
<i>to dance through the dark,</i>

1516
01:14:14,365 --> 01:14:15,749
<i>to frolic through</i>
<i>the ferocity</i>

1517
01:14:15,850 --> 01:14:16,750
and trounce the--

1518
01:14:16,851 --> 01:14:18,952
No,
no, no.

1519
01:14:19,053 --> 01:14:20,921
Yeah.

1520
01:14:21,022 --> 01:14:23,657
What we're trying to say,
Farley, is we're...

1521
01:14:23,758 --> 01:14:25,559
we're so sorry.

1522
01:14:25,860 --> 01:14:29,363


1523
01:14:29,464 --> 01:14:31,514
 I barely remember 

1524
01:14:31,616 --> 01:14:34,117
 those weeks that went by. 

1525
01:14:34,218 --> 01:14:37,520
 Except for the
constant, irresistible cry 

1526
01:14:37,622 --> 01:14:42,759
 of the ice urging
me to come skate. 

1527
01:14:42,860 --> 01:14:45,095
 But I made my decision 

1528
01:14:45,196 --> 01:14:48,431
 I sealed my hockey fate. 

1529
01:14:48,532 --> 01:14:49,900
<i> However,</i>
<i>my resolve, </i>

1530
01:14:49,902 --> 01:14:52,519
<i> which once</i>
<i>seemed so strong </i>

1531
01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:54,388
 started to waiver 

1532
01:14:54,489 --> 01:14:57,491
 as my exile dragged on. 

1533
01:14:57,592 --> 01:15:01,128
 I'm the addict
tempted by vice. 

1534
01:15:01,229 --> 01:15:05,633
 Too weak to resist
the lure of the ice. 

1535
01:15:05,734 --> 01:15:06,900


1536
01:15:07,002 --> 01:15:10,637
 Has hockey corrupted
my very soul? 

1537
01:15:10,738 --> 01:15:12,956
 It was always a game 

1538
01:15:13,057 --> 01:15:15,625
 and never a life goal. 

1539
01:15:20,331 --> 01:15:26,236


1540
01:15:26,337 --> 01:15:29,956
 Am I dreaming?
I must be asleep. 

1541
01:15:30,057 --> 01:15:33,844
 Why is Walter Gretzky
on this rink? 

1542
01:15:33,945 --> 01:15:34,911


1543
01:15:35,013 --> 01:15:36,496
 The power of hockey 

1544
01:15:36,597 --> 01:15:38,631
 works in mysterious ways. 

1545
01:15:38,733 --> 01:15:40,717


1546
01:15:40,818 --> 01:15:41,952
We're here
to see you past

1547
01:15:42,053 --> 01:15:44,421
this miserable phase.

1548
01:15:44,522 --> 01:15:47,374


1549
01:15:47,475 --> 01:15:51,045
 We all know hockey's the
best sport on the planet. 

1550
01:15:51,146 --> 01:15:52,879
<i> Theo Fleury's singing, </i>

1551
01:15:52,980 --> 01:15:56,200
<i> What can't he do,</i>
<i>damn it? </i>

1552
01:15:56,301 --> 01:16:00,086
 Play your own game.
To thine own self be true. 

1553
01:16:00,288 --> 01:16:02,506
 Don't let a couple
of punches... 

1554
01:16:02,607 --> 01:16:04,842
 defeat you. 

1555
01:16:04,943 --> 01:16:06,910
 'Cause hockey's
the greatest 

1556
01:16:07,011 --> 01:16:09,412
 game in the land. 

1557
01:16:09,514 --> 01:16:13,700
 You've got the goods
to be your own man. 

1558
01:16:13,801 --> 01:16:16,319
 'Cause hockey's
the greatest 

1559
01:16:16,420 --> 01:16:18,722
 game in the land. 

1560
01:16:18,823 --> 01:16:23,293
 Time to change the plan. 

1561
01:16:23,394 --> 01:16:33,136


1562
01:16:33,237 --> 01:16:35,005
 Could they be
onto something? 

1563
01:16:35,106 --> 01:16:37,107
 Could they be right? 

1564
01:16:37,208 --> 01:16:39,076
 I'm starting to see
this whole world 

1565
01:16:39,177 --> 01:16:41,712
 in a different light. 

1566
01:16:41,813 --> 01:16:43,613
 Maybe just maybe, 

1567
01:16:43,715 --> 01:16:46,482
 it's more heroic to play 

1568
01:16:46,634 --> 01:16:51,838
 To search my soul,
to find a new way. 

1569
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:59,312


1570
01:17:11,308 --> 01:17:14,294
I should have
guessed it was you.

1571
01:17:14,395 --> 01:17:15,662
Hey,
Eve.

1572
01:17:15,763 --> 01:17:17,931
I didn't realize that
the window was open.

1573
01:17:20,001 --> 01:17:20,967
You know, it's not
great for the environment

1574
01:17:21,068 --> 01:17:23,387
to waste all
that heat, right?

1575
01:17:23,488 --> 01:17:26,322
I can't shut my radiator
off, David Suzuki.

1576
01:17:29,260 --> 01:17:31,061
What do you want?

1577
01:17:33,097 --> 01:17:34,731


1578
01:17:34,832 --> 01:17:38,001

 There's... 

1585
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:03,410
 There's one thing
that I need to confess. 

1586
01:18:03,511 --> 01:18:05,279


1587

 You're a goddess.

1591
01:18:17,492 --> 01:18:19,660
<i> Because we've</i>

01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:22,479
<i> from infancy, </i>

1593
01:18:22,580 --> 01:18:24,848
 well, you've
always seemed like 

1594
01:18:24,949 --> 01:18:28,117
 a sister to me. 

1595
01:18:28,218 --> 01:18:30,370
<i> So when I began</i>

1596

<i> in a more romantic light </i>

1597
01:18:33,274 --> 01:18:35,409
 All those feelings I tried 

1598
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:38,912
 so valiantly to fight 

1599
01:18:39,013 --> 01:18:42,799
<i> I was afraid of</i>

1601
01:18:44,235 --> 01:18:49,756
 That you'd think my
love was, well, rude. 

1602
01:18:49,857 --> 01:18:53,944


1603
01:18:54,045 --> 01:18:55,946
 Oh no, 

1604
01:18:56,047 --> 01:18:58,915
 maybe she's a prude. 

1605

1608
01:19:13,814 --> 01:19:18,635
 How did I
miss that feeling? 

1609
01:19:18,736 --> 01:19:22,906
 It's so obviously
contagious. 

1610

1611
01:19:25,794 --> 01:19:30,463
 Now I understand
just how Marco 

1612

1614
01:19:35,285 --> 01:19:38,989
 Let's make
one thing clear 

1615
01:19:39,089 --> 01:19:44,160
 I only like men who
skate with sticks. 

1616

1617
01:19:46,564 --> 01:19:49,766
 You're the most

01:19:54,171 --> 01:19:57,473
 You're this girl's dream 

1621
01:19:57,575 --> 01:19:59,308
 There's just
one more thing 

1622
01:19:59,410 --> 01:20:01,878
 to add to this refrain 

1623
01:20:01,979 --> 01:20:07,183
 I've decided to
play hockey again. 

1624
01:20:07,285 --> 01:20:18,144


1625
01:20:18,245 --> 01:20:21,999
 You,

1626
01:20:22,100 --> 01:20:26,719
 It's always been you 

1627
01:20:26,820 --> 01:20:32,509
 It's always been you 

1628
01:20:32,610 --> 01:20:34,761
 It's always
been you 

1629
01:20:34,862 --> 01:20:37,164
 It's always
been you 

1630
01:20:37,264 --> 01:20:42,319
 It's always
been you 

1631
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:44,187


1632
01:20:44,289 --> 01:20:48,224
 You're not upset
With my choice? 

1633
01:20:48,359 --> 01:20:51,244
 Of course not.
Hockey's your muse. 

1634
01:20:51,345 --> 01:20:54,247
 Hockey's your voice. 

1635
01:20:54,348 --> 01:20:56,383
 Please just promise 

1636
01:20:56,484 --> 01:21:00,837
 that to your own self
<i>you'll remain true </i>

1637
01:21:00,939 --> 01:21:02,372


1638
01:21:02,473 --> 01:21:05,375
 Funny,
that's what someone else 

1639
01:21:05,476 --> 01:21:09,346
 said I should do. 

1640
01:21:09,447 --> 01:21:14,784


1641
01:21:17,938 --> 01:21:19,439
<i>Mum, Dad,</i>
<i>wake up!</i>

1642
01:21:19,441 --> 01:21:20,640
Oh.                       Death?

1643
01:21:20,642 --> 01:21:21,474
Where's the dog?

1644
01:21:21,575 --> 01:21:22,842
Who?

1645
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:23,843
<i>The dog.</i>
<i>Where's--</i>

1646
01:21:23,945 --> 01:21:25,378
Listen...

1647
01:21:25,479 --> 01:21:26,813
<i>I'm going to play</i>
<i>hockey again.</i>

1648
01:21:30,467 --> 01:21:32,786
Respect, courage, heart!

1649
01:21:32,887 --> 01:21:35,922
So I don't care
how tired you are,

1650
01:21:36,023 --> 01:21:37,941
we play two-way
hockey tonight!

1651
01:21:38,042 --> 01:21:39,509
<i>When your man</i>
<i>skates up to you--</i>

1652
01:21:42,629 --> 01:21:44,297
What the hell
are you doing here?

1653
01:21:44,398 --> 01:21:46,266
Coach, I'm here to
rejoin the team.

1654
01:21:49,336 --> 01:21:50,336
Last time I checked,
you quit because

1655
01:21:50,438 --> 01:21:52,739
the rough stuff offended
your sensibilities.

1656
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:54,608
So I hate to break it
to you there buttercup,

1657
01:21:54,709 --> 01:21:57,194
but we still don't do
delicate in this league.

1658
01:21:57,295 --> 01:21:59,196
I think you're oversimplifying

1659
01:21:59,297 --> 01:22:01,264
the argument considerably.

1660
01:22:01,365 --> 01:22:02,899
<i>Coach...</i>

1661
01:22:03,067 --> 01:22:06,085


1662
01:22:06,186 --> 01:22:07,687
Can I say something?

1663
01:22:07,788 --> 01:22:08,921


1664
01:22:09,007 --> 01:22:10,190
Really?
Right now?

1665
01:22:10,291 --> 01:22:14,894


1666
01:22:14,996 --> 01:22:16,463
 After you quit, 

1667
01:22:16,564 --> 01:22:18,031
 we had a team meeting. 

1668
01:22:18,132 --> 01:22:19,699
 Behind closed doors, 

1669
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:21,568
 in spite of my pleading 

1670
01:22:21,669 --> 01:22:22,902
 When you left the ice 

1671
01:22:23,037 --> 01:22:24,738
 on the brink of tears 

1672
01:22:25,005 --> 01:22:26,139
 It broke
something in us 

1673
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:27,791
 that had been
building for years. 

1674
01:22:27,892 --> 01:22:31,127
 We took an objective
look at our behaviour. 

1675
01:22:31,228 --> 01:22:34,247
 Asked some more questions
as to who's not in favour. 

1676
01:22:34,348 --> 01:22:37,483
 As the way of the fist as
a game's divine right 

1677
01:22:37,584 --> 01:22:39,152
 And proving
your manhood with

1678
01:22:39,253 --> 01:22:40,887
 how well you could fight. 

1679
01:22:40,988 --> 01:22:43,639
 I swear we channeled
the spirit 

1680
01:22:43,741 --> 01:22:47,744
 of Oprah in that room. 

1681
01:22:47,845 --> 01:22:50,213
 The catharsis was awesome. 

1682
01:22:50,281 --> 01:22:54,851
<i> Especially for</i>
<i>this goon. </i>

1683
01:22:54,952 --> 01:22:57,087


1684
01:22:57,188 --> 01:22:59,789
 But, Farley, our conclusion
never changed the fact 

1685
01:22:59,890 --> 01:23:03,109
 That if you can't dance,
we can't watch your back. 

1686
01:23:03,210 --> 01:23:06,362
 Though we all agreed
pacifism has a place 

1687
01:23:06,463 --> 01:23:07,831
 Just not in hockey 

1688
01:23:07,932 --> 01:23:09,683
 'cause we'll
all be disgraced. 

1689
01:23:09,784 --> 01:23:13,920
 Actually, I might have
another way we can embrace.

1690
01:23:14,021 --> 01:23:17,374


1691
01:23:17,475 --> 01:23:20,927
 My name is Farley Gordon
And I don't like to fight 

1692
01:23:21,029 --> 01:23:22,579
 My name is Farley Gordon 

1693
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:24,714
 Let's have a
clean game tonight 

1694
01:23:24,815 --> 01:23:26,482
 His name is
Farley Gordon 

1695
01:23:26,583 --> 01:23:28,184
 He's showing
us a new light 

1696
01:23:28,285 --> 01:23:30,337
 Though we might not
all agree that 

1697
01:23:30,438 --> 01:23:32,572
 his philosophy
is actually right. 

1698
01:23:32,673 --> 01:23:35,842


1699
01:23:35,943 --> 01:23:39,312
 Get off this ice unless you
want to feel my wrath 

1700
01:23:39,413 --> 01:23:42,949
<i> Back off. Let him try</i>
<i>to forge a new hockey path </i>

1701
01:23:43,050 --> 01:23:46,753
 It's okay I can handle this
misplaced aggression 

1702
01:23:46,921 --> 01:23:50,523
 Let's have an on-ice
therapy session 

1703
01:23:50,624 --> 01:24:01,884


1704
01:24:01,935 --> 01:24:03,653
 Don't think I won't
rip off your head 

1705
01:24:03,754 --> 01:24:05,588
 I'd rather hug
it out instead 

1706
01:24:05,656 --> 01:24:07,724


1707
01:24:07,825 --> 01:24:10,059
<crowd>
Aw!

1708
01:24:14,982 --> 01:24:16,950
<i> Oh.... Please,</i>
<i>I'm begging </i>

1709
01:24:17,051 --> 01:24:20,653
 This is stripping
all my bravado 

1710
01:24:20,754 --> 01:24:22,421


1711
01:24:22,522 --> 01:24:24,758
 Let's end
this dispute 

1712
01:24:24,859 --> 01:24:28,828
 and I'll gladly
let you go 

1713
01:24:28,962 --> 01:24:30,230
 Argh...! 

1714
01:24:34,769 --> 01:24:36,068
 Okay,
truce. 

1715
01:24:36,169 --> 01:24:37,937
 I won't make you
drop the gloves. 

1716
01:24:38,038 --> 01:24:44,194
<cheering>

1717
01:24:44,295 --> 01:24:47,447
 I sincerely appreciate
your outpouring of love. 

1718
01:24:47,548 --> 01:24:51,467


1719
01:24:51,568 --> 01:24:54,153
 Anyone else going care
to take a run at me? 

1720
01:24:54,254 --> 01:24:55,155


1721
01:24:55,256 --> 01:24:56,156
<i> Be forewarned -- </i>

1722
01:24:56,257 --> 01:25:01,461
<i> I will hug you</i>
<i>'til eternity! </i>

1723
01:25:01,562 --> 01:25:03,463


1724
01:25:03,564 --> 01:25:05,832
<cheering>

1725
01:25:05,966 --> 01:25:07,884


1726
01:25:07,985 --> 01:25:09,686
 One, two, three, four! 

1727
01:25:09,787 --> 01:25:12,322
 Pugilist or pacifist
We can all be fans. 

1728
01:25:12,422 --> 01:25:13,889
 It's hockey!
It's hockey! 

1729
01:25:13,990 --> 01:25:16,426
 The greatest
game in the land. 

1730
01:25:16,527 --> 01:25:17,327
 Moose Jaw to Newfoundland 

1731
01:25:17,428 --> 01:25:18,862
 This we understand 

1732
01:25:18,963 --> 01:25:20,179
 Because hockey,
hockey's 

1733
01:25:20,448 --> 01:25:22,465
 the greatest
game in the land. 

1734
01:25:22,467 --> 01:25:23,566
 Wickenheiser,
Cassie Campbell, 

1735
01:25:23,667 --> 01:25:25,134
 you can be a woman. 

1736
01:25:25,235 --> 01:25:26,636
 It's hockey,
hockey 

1737
01:25:26,737 --> 01:25:29,505
 The greatest
game in the land 

1738
01:25:29,624 --> 01:25:30,390
Woo!

1739
01:25:30,491 --> 01:25:31,958
Yeah!

1740
01:25:32,059 --> 01:25:33,192
Yes!                    Yeah!

1741
01:25:33,293 --> 01:25:34,877


1742
01:25:34,978 --> 01:25:37,564
 I swear this kid is going
down in history. 

1743
01:25:37,665 --> 01:25:40,700
 What do I know?
No one ever listens to me. 

1744
01:25:40,801 --> 01:25:44,070
 At least he's going to make
us a boatload of money 

1745
01:25:44,171 --> 01:25:45,872
 Hockey,
hockey 

1746
01:25:45,973 --> 01:25:47,440
 The greatest
game in the land. 

1747
01:25:47,541 --> 01:25:50,242
 Look at him skate
He satisfies all my rages. 

1748
01:25:50,377 --> 01:25:51,711
 His name is Farley Gordon 

1749
01:25:51,812 --> 01:25:53,646
 And his girlfriend
is hot-rageous 

1750
01:25:53,797 --> 01:25:56,950
<i> I'm finding this happiness</i>
<i>incredibly contagious </i>

1751
01:25:57,051 --> 01:25:58,101
 Hockey,
hockey 

1752
01:25:58,202 --> 01:25:59,836
 The greatest
game in the land. 

1753
01:25:59,937 --> 01:26:02,972
 Oh, oh, oh, oh
Hockey, hockey 

1754
01:26:03,073 --> 01:26:06,092
 Oh, oh, oh, oh
Hockey, hockey 

1755
01:26:06,193 --> 01:26:09,462
 Oh, oh, oh, oh
Hockey, hockey 

1756
01:26:09,563 --> 01:26:12,749
 The greatest
game in the land. 

1757
01:26:12,850 --> 01:26:13,800
 His name is Farley Gordon 

1758
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:15,535
 And he's showing
us a new light. 

1759
01:26:15,636 --> 01:26:18,655
 He's making me look
like a sieve tonight 

1760
01:26:18,756 --> 01:26:20,089
 His name is Farley Gordon 

1761
01:26:20,190 --> 01:26:21,907
 And his skills
are out of sight 

1762
01:26:22,008 --> 01:26:23,409
 Hockey,
hockey 

1763
01:26:23,510 --> 01:26:25,712
 The greatest
game in the land. 

1764
01:26:25,779 --> 01:26:28,231
 Oh, oh, oh, oh
Hockey, hockey 

1765
01:26:28,332 --> 01:26:31,334
 Oh, oh, oh, oh
Hockey, hockey

01:26:31,602 --> 01:26:34,587
 Oh, oh, oh, oh
Hockey, hockey

01:26:34,688 --> 01:26:37,773
 Oh, oh, oh, oh
Hockey, hockey 

1768
01:26:37,874 --> 01:26:39,041
 His name is Farley Gordon 

1769
01:26:39,143 --> 01:26:40,743
 And he's got mad moves 

1770
01:26:40,844 --> 01:26:42,195
 His name is Farley Gordon 

1771
01:26:42,296 --> 01:26:44,130
 And nothing left
to prove 

1772
01:26:44,231 --> 01:26:45,364
 His name is Farley Gordon 

1773
01:26:45,465 --> 01:26:47,000
 And he wants
us to be fans 

1774
01:26:47,101 --> 01:26:48,518
 His name is Farley Gordon 

1775
01:26:48,619 --> 01:26:50,453
 The greatest
game in the world 

1776
01:26:50,554 --> 01:26:53,122
 We are proud Canadians.
Hockey's in our DNA 

1777
01:26:53,223 --> 01:26:56,326
 We are proud Canadians and
we're not afraid to say 

1778
01:26:56,427 --> 01:26:59,395
 We are proud Canadians and
we'll always find a way 

1779
01:26:59,496 --> 01:27:01,397
 playing hockey,
hockey 

1780
01:27:01,498 --> 01:27:03,049
 The greatest game
in the land 

1781
01:27:03,150 --> 01:27:06,135
 Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Hockey, hockey 

1782
01:27:06,236 --> 01:27:09,338
 Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Hockey, hockey 

1783
01:27:09,439 --> 01:27:12,676
 Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Hockey, hockey 

1784
01:27:12,793 --> 01:27:14,443
 Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Hockey, hockey 

1785
01:27:14,512 --> 01:27:17,246
 The greatest
game in the land 

1786
01:27:17,347 --> 01:27:30,877
<cheering>

1787
01:27:33,614 --> 01:28:07,447


1788
01:28:07,548 --> 01:28:10,417
Was your son
a late bloomer or...?

1789
01:28:10,518 --> 01:28:12,118
Are you from Mars?

1790
01:28:12,219 --> 01:28:15,154
Oh,
no.

1791
01:28:15,289 --> 01:28:18,741
Do you have any advice
for a new hockey dad?

1792
01:28:18,842 --> 01:28:20,009
Give your son or
daughter

1793
01:28:20,110 --> 01:28:22,679
every opportunity
to play the game

1794
01:28:22,779 --> 01:28:24,647
and enjoy the
game and get better

1795
01:28:24,748 --> 01:28:26,282
at it all the time.

1796
01:28:26,383 --> 01:28:27,617
I suppose.

1797
01:28:27,718 --> 01:28:29,652
Boy, you see how much the
sticks cost now, though?

1798
01:28:29,753 --> 01:28:31,821
I just saw
one for $200.

1799
01:28:31,922 --> 01:28:34,657
My first stick was
one from the bush.

1800
01:28:34,758 --> 01:28:36,125
I cut a
tree branch down

1801
01:28:36,227 --> 01:28:37,694
and carved a hockey
stick out of it.

1802
01:28:37,794 --> 01:28:38,961
That was
my first stick.

1803
01:28:39,062 --> 01:28:39,962
Oh my gawd.

1804
01:28:40,063 --> 01:28:41,997
I lived on a farm.
Isn't that something?

1805
01:28:42,099 --> 01:28:43,466
That's amazing.

1806
01:28:43,567 --> 01:28:45,101
Come on,
we'll watch the game.

1807
01:28:45,202 --> 01:33:07,981
