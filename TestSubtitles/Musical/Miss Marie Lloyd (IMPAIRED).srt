524
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,568
But these bills do need settling.

525
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,601

00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,888
I suggest you collar him for yourself.

533
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,562

smelling of cheap perfume.

535

(Cheering and applause)

800
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,691
You meant what you were singing,
didn't you, Alec?

801
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,722
I did.

802
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,762
I could tell.

803
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:20,124
There was a sparkle in them eyes, and
'rt weren't caused by the stage lamps, was it?

804
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,924
No.

805
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,962
What caused it?

806
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,689
You know what caused it.

807
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:29,846
<i>You did.</i>

808
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,405
As always.

809
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:33,770
The things you say.

810
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:36,646
Really'?

811
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,682
(Sighs heavily)

812
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:47,722
What's up, Alec?

813
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,967
You make me shiver when you hold my hand.

814
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,411
(Giggles)

815
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,442
You need a pair of gloves, darting.

816
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:55,642
I'll buy you some from Simpson's.

817
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,682
I don't need gloves to keep me warm.

818
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,642
What do you need?

819
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:04,561
NaUQW-

00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,161
- You're an old rooster, ain't you?
- (Chuckles)

821
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,684
Old faithful, more like.

822
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,562
I could do with some of that right now.

823
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:19,328
Me too.

824
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:22,966
Percy Courtney said he would love me forever.

825
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,762
Don'! let me down, Alec, eh?

826
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,291
Never.

827
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:41,924
I'm sure we can come to an amicable
arrangememt, Miss Lloyd.

828
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,325
Why must 'rt be amicable?

829
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:45,442
I'll give him £2,000 for three years.

830
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:47,960
Miss Lloyd, these matters are complicated.

831
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,241
There's the issue of custody. The house.

832
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,203
Those are my terms.

833
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,844
Take 'rt or leave it.

834
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,882
Miss Lloyd, please. Stay.

835
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:59,485
I'll take it.

836
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,522
SOLICITOR: Oh.

837
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:03,005
Good day, sir.

838
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,282
- She looks old.
- Yes.

839
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:13,322
And fat

840
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:21,523
Still...nothing lasts forever, does it?

841
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:24,562
(Clears throat)

842
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:31,962
Marie Lloyd does 'rt again.

843
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,689
Oh!

844
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,248
I love these slippers.

845
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,487
(Marie laughs) Oh, Alec, you are funny!

846
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,522
How can anyone love slippers?

847
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:49,767
I don'! know. I just do. They feel light

848
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,201
Just like you and me in this house together.

849
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,242
- That feels right too.
- Yeah.

850
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:57,730
We're going to have a lovely little life together.

851
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,171
Lillie?

852
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,884
Where's me champagne?

853
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:03,882
I thought this morning - tea.

854
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,605
- Tea's for old ladies.
- We're not getting any younger.

855
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,642
Alec, you were born a hundred.

856
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:10,284
(Chuckles)

857
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,049
We could walk on the heath today.

858
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:16,042
I thought we could work on a double ad.

859
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,202

that I'm vlith you people.</i>

864
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:42,121
They can bully you, but they can't bully me.

865
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:45,243
So together we shall be indestructible.

866
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,242
Fair deal for artists!

867

Fair deal for artists!

868
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,927
What does Marie think she's doing, Alec?

869
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:56,362
- She won't be talked out of it.
- You know this strike's spreading.

870
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:00,246
Two more halls in Shoreditch have gone dark.
She'll drive us all out of business.

871
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,886
- I know, sir. But...
- What kind of man are you?

872
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:04,809
She's your wife. Tell her!

873
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:06,205
Make her obey you!

874
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,087
He's blaming me for not controlling you.

875
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:17,122
(Laughs)

876
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,162
What does he think I am, your dog?

877
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,407
I told him that's easier said than done.

878
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:25,843
If 'rt wasn't for me, those giﬂs would be crushed
and back at work humiliated.

879
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:28,804
<i>Yeah, but you've made your point now,
though, yeah?</i>

880
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:30,842
It's not about making a point.

881
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:34,089
- You'll run out of money at this rate.
- It gives me pleasure.

882
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:37,329
Yes, but are you doing good
to make yourself feel better?

883
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:39,249
With this Strike?

884
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:43,845
What do you suggest, then, Alec?
That we cave in to Belafonte and his like?

885
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:46,842
No, of course not

886
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:19,169
Tell Miss... Ask Miss Lloyd
to come and see me, would you?

887
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,883
One newspaper has called you a saint.

888
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:27,287
Ah, how nice of them.

889
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:31,764
I'll pay you a hundred pounds a week

890
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:34,326
if you break the strike and go back to work.

891
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:36,681
Don't talk silly. I'm not a blackleg, Arthur.

892
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,449
But you don't seem to mind betraying

893
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:42,405
those who helped you climb to the top
in the beginning, do you?

894
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,522
It's the public who make you a star, dear.

895
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:48,610
And it's the managers
who pay you handsomely for that privilege.

896
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,449
You only pay me what I'm worth.

897
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,482
And you are worth everything.

898
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:55,967
But you shouldn't sully
your professional reputation.

899
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,324
Especially not when there's an invitation
to perform before the King.

900
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:03,762
We all want you topping the bill
at the Royal Command, but...

901
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:07,088
Are you attempting to blackmail me,
Mr Belafonte?

902
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,929
Not at all.

903
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,201
I'm appealing to your better nature.

904
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,567
I will not cave in to your demands.

905
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:19,644
The public like me, and His Majesty,
I am sure, is quite aware of that.

906
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,480
I take 'rt that's your last word on the matter?

907
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:33,409
Minimum performance rates for all of you!

908
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,402
Is everybody hBPPW

909
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:38,568
- (Cheering)
- You bet your life we are!

910
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:41,841
Well done, Marie.

911
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:43,882
Thank you, Arthur.

912
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:45,922
All is forgiven.

913
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:51,082
Forgiven, but never forgotten.

914
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,002
I just think, as my

915
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:04,884
Oh, be quiet, Alec. Just be quiet.

916
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:07,526
- I was merely pointing out...
- I know, I know.

917
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:09,562
I should be drinking tea.

918
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,330
Shall we go for a walk?

919
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:15,561
No.

920
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:18,685
Just trying to be pleasant

921
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:22,327
And as with everything else, you're failing,
I'm afraid, Alec.

922
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:29,404
You'll end up with no-one.

923
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:31,402

(sighs)

926
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:02,849
First little tiff and you run off,
never to be seen again.

00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:04,325
Mane.

928
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:06,362
You said you'd always look after me.

929
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:09,289
I thought you...

930
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:11,448
I knew you'd be missing me.

Always having to draw aﬂemion to yourself.
It's undignified.

Undignified, is it, 0 mister high and mighty?

969
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:36,122
What's dignified, then? You?

970
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:37,844
I know how to behave.

971
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:40,565
But you don't know how to have fun.
That's the difference.

972

- You're a married woman.
- Yes.

973

But I'm not dead.

974
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,082
You're starting to disgust people.

975

- Can you not see that?
- No, I disgust you.

976

979
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:57,567
You think they're interested in what you do?

980
01:01:57,600 --> 01:01:59,602
No-one would have heard of you if not for me.

981
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:02,564
For what it's worth, people had heard of me.

982
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,851
They clap your ad
because you're married to me.

983
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:07,882
They clap out of respecl...for me.

984
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:10,965

Yeah.

997
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:14,484
Why are they being so horrible about me
in the papers?

998

- Well...
- Why?

999

You're supposed to be married.

1000
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:21,049
Huh. Hardly.

1001
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:23,082
Alec Hurley was a little mistake.

1002
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:25,202
Surely I'm allowed to make a mistake.

1003
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:26,651
They like Alec.

1004

They haven't taken to Bernard.

1005

They don'! know Bernard.

1006
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:33,081
They're being cruel about him to get at me.

1007
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:36,442
Still, you like him, Freddie. That's the main thing.

without Marie Lloyd on the bill?

1010

His Majesty doesn't want you.
Nothing to do with me.

1011
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:51,011
- Who's 'rt to do with, then?
- Take 'rt up with the King.

1012
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:53,850
- Is 'rt because of the strike?
- Among other things.

1013
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:57,446
I was coming to the aid of my fellow performers.

1014
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:00,131
I was being honourable.
And for that I'm condemned?

1015
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:01,889
It's not just the strike, is it?

1016

Well, what else, then?
What else can 'rt possibly be?

I am the most famous music hall singer

To perform before the King of our country,

the artistes must have
an untarnished reputation.
