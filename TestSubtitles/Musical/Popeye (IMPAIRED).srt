Hmph!
Although not really.

330
00:15:17,206 --> 00:15:19,208
I mean, well, Mr. Geezil
and Mr. Wimpy are, um...

331
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:20,709
Me, I'm family.

332
00:15:20,709 --> 00:15:22,711
Well, you're
my husband.

333
00:15:22,711 --> 00:15:24,713
You owe me an apology.

334
00:15:24,713 --> 00:15:27,215
OLIVE:
Well, I can't find anything.

335
00:15:27,216 --> 00:15:28,717
What are you
looking for, Olive?

336
00:15:28,717 --> 00:15:30,218
A glass.
Oh, uh, here's a glass.

337
00:15:30,219 --> 00:15:32,221
That's a short, fat, ugly glass.

338
00:15:32,221 --> 00:15:34,223
I want a tall, pretty,
slender glass.

339
00:15:34,223 --> 00:15:35,724
They're all broken.

340
00:15:35,724 --> 00:15:36,725
I could've made
a fortune in fish futures...

341
00:15:36,725 --> 00:15:38,727
Fish?
but I'd have to dip into capital.

342
00:15:38,727 --> 00:15:40,729
Fish futures smell.
( <i>laughter</i> )

343
00:15:40,729 --> 00:15:43,231
What kind of glass
do you want, Olive?

344
00:15:43,232 --> 00:15:44,233
A wine glass

345
00:15:44,233 --> 00:15:47,236
or a brandy glass,
or a water glass?

346
00:15:47,236 --> 00:15:48,737
Oh, not a thing--
I don't want a thing.

347
00:15:48,737 --> 00:15:49,738
Real appetizing.

348
00:15:49,738 --> 00:15:50,739
I want a fork.

349
00:15:50,739 --> 00:15:52,240
Right beside
your plate.

350
00:15:52,241 --> 00:15:53,742
If it was a knife,
it would cut you.

351
00:15:53,742 --> 00:15:55,243
And a knife.
Will you sit down?

352
00:15:55,244 --> 00:15:56,745
Why don't I have a knife?
And a nice dress?

353
00:15:56,745 --> 00:15:58,246
You owe me
an apology.

354
00:15:58,247 --> 00:16:00,749
( <i>Geezil muttering</i> )

355
00:16:00,749 --> 00:16:02,250
Passing fish,
please.

356
00:16:02,251 --> 00:16:03,752
Fish, excellent idea, Miss Oyl.

357
00:16:03,752 --> 00:16:05,253
I would suggest before
matrimony, fish.

358
00:16:05,754 --> 00:16:07,756
Fish before
matrimony.

359
00:16:07,756 --> 00:16:09,758
Ooh, that does look good, there.

360
00:16:09,758 --> 00:16:11,760
Wish I had a plate though.

361
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,764
...because four times
engaged is three times much.

362
00:16:15,764 --> 00:16:17,766
Oh, he can't talk me
out of anything; I'm not a child.

363
00:16:17,766 --> 00:16:19,267
I'll say you're
not a child.

364
00:16:19,268 --> 00:16:21,770
Who says I'm not a child?
You said you're not a child

365
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,272
and I agreed with you,
that's who.

366
00:16:23,272 --> 00:16:24,273
Who asked you
to agree with me?

367
00:16:24,273 --> 00:16:25,774
Well, no one can stop me
from agreeing with you

368
00:16:25,774 --> 00:16:27,275
if I want to.
I can.

369
00:16:27,276 --> 00:16:28,277
Quarreling at
my table.

370
00:16:28,277 --> 00:16:29,778
You both owe me
an apology.

371
00:16:29,778 --> 00:16:31,279
Sorry, Pop.

372
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:31,780
What?

373
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,281
Please pass the shrimp,

374
00:16:33,282 --> 00:16:34,283
chicken and meatballs.

375
00:16:34,283 --> 00:16:36,785
Well, I don't know.

376
00:16:36,785 --> 00:16:39,788
Captain Bluto has
the patience of Job.

377
00:16:39,788 --> 00:16:40,789
Or is it job?

378
00:16:40,789 --> 00:16:43,291
Certainly got
a very good job, Job.

379
00:16:43,292 --> 00:16:45,794
And he needs a lot of patience.

380
00:16:45,794 --> 00:16:48,296
Why, he runs this town
for the Commodore

381
00:16:48,297 --> 00:16:49,298
while he's away.

382
00:16:49,298 --> 00:16:50,799
And the Commodore's always away.

383
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:52,300
As a matter of fact,
I've never seen him.

384
00:16:52,301 --> 00:16:53,802
Have you, Cole?
What?

385
00:16:53,802 --> 00:16:55,804
I'd never let a girl
break my engagement.

386
00:16:55,804 --> 00:16:58,807
I'd break her nose before
she broke my engagement.

387
00:16:58,807 --> 00:17:01,810
And you better not try on me
what you pulled on Bluto,

388
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:03,812
because I'm no pushover.

389
00:17:03,812 --> 00:17:05,814
You owe your
sister an apology.

390
00:17:05,814 --> 00:17:07,315
Will you stop fidgeting?

391
00:17:07,316 --> 00:17:08,817
Finishing touch here.

392
00:17:08,817 --> 00:17:10,819

Oh, this knife won't cut.

393

Here, take mine.

394
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:12,821
Not since I was child

395
00:17:12,821 --> 00:17:14,322
have we had a sharp knife
in this house.

396
00:17:14,323 --> 00:17:15,824
COLE:
You owe me an apology.

397
00:17:15,824 --> 00:17:17,325
You don't like
our knives.

398
00:17:17,326 --> 00:17:19,828
Bluto's rich, he can buy you
plenty of knives.

399
00:17:19,828 --> 00:17:22,330
Ooh, I hate this table,
it's ugly.

400
00:17:22,331 --> 00:17:24,833
I'm the only one with
nerve enough to tell the truth about it.

401
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:26,835
( <i>nasally</i> ):
Well, then, why don't you let Bluto the pushover

buy you a new table?

403
00:17:27,836 --> 00:17:28,837
Am I right, Pop?
Right.

404
00:17:28,837 --> 00:17:29,838
I'm right, right?

405
00:17:29,838 --> 00:17:30,839
You're right.
Right.

Oh... Bluto, Bluto, Bluto.

Everyone takes advantage
of my poor Bluto.

Get a new... glass,
