1
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,193
- Morning.
- (Woman) Good morning.

2
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:57,437
When I was in Lublin studying last week,
I found this wonderful book.

3
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,676
Can you believe the price of cabbage?

4
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,398
(* Woman humming)

5
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:07,474
For instance, he gives 25 different
interpretations of Genesis alone.

6
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,030
Best in the market.
Parsnip, turnip, everything for soup!

7
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,116
Storybooks for women,
sacred books for men!

8
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,156
Lovely picture books for women.

9
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,196
(Man). . in each sentence.

10
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,390
Fish, fish! Fishy fish!

11
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,913
(Child) Mama!

12
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,116
(Boy) Rachel!

13
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,789
Fish! Fish!

14
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,075
Come, look. Look at this, ladies.

15
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,072
Fine herring, beautiful silver carp.

16
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,913
- (Woman) Delicious.
- See the difference?

17
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,389
The skin should be tight, firm,

18
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,675
and the scales shiny like diamonds.

19
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,911
- Yentl, how's Papa?
- He's much better, thank you.

20
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,831
Then there's the smell.

21
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,754
(Man) Lovely picture books for women,
sacred books for men.

22
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,718
Storybooks for women,
sacred books for men.

23
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,553
Yentl? Yentl, what would
you like to have?

24
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,039
Erm...

25
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,076
Yentl, a pike or a carp?

26
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,469
- Fine.
- A nice carp.

27
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,949
Novels for women, sacred books for men.

28
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,158
Yentl, what's this I hear?
You finality got engaged.

29
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,596
- I don't know.
- What? Did you or didn't you?

30
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,716
What, hear about it or do it?

31
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,679
If she can joke about finding a husband
at her age, I should worry.

32
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,036
Here you are.
So beautiful, it'll cook itself. (Chuckles)

33
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,599
What's so funny?

34
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,433
- Will you buy my fish?
- I'll eat chicken.

35
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,310
Storybooks for women,
sacred books for men.

36
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,391
Yentl, did you hear about Helen Shipman?

37
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,948
- I haven't got time.
- You never do.

38
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,230
- Buy your gruel.
- Sacred books for men.

39
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,550
Lovely picture books for women.

40
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,712
He relates the mysticism of creation

41
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,756
to the mysticism of language.

42
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,831
We shouldn’t be reading these things.

43
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,232
- Can we afford it?
- No, but there's one in the rabbi's study.

44
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,072
Come on.

45
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,878
What a nice girl! There's your change.

46
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,389
- You're in the wrong place, miss.
- What?

47
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,869
Books for women are over here.

48
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,599
- Novels, very romantic.
- I'd like this one.

49
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,636
- Sacred books are for men.
- Why?

50
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,790
- It's a law.
- Where is it written?

51
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,836
Never mind where. It's a Law.

52
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,115
Well, maybe it's written in here.

53
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,079
Miss, do me a favor. Do yourself a favor.

54
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,311
Ah, here, buy a nice picture book.

55
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,551
- Girls Like picture books.
- What if I told you it's for my father?

56
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,872
Why didn't you say? 15 kopecks.

57
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,838
- And that's written inside the cover.
- Thank you.

58
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,670
(Papa coughing) Good. And who's wise?

59
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,399
- (David) He who knows a lot.
- No, try again.

60
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,436
- Who's wise?
- (David) Erm... he who...

61
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,796
- He who learns from all men.
- (David) He who Learns from all men?

62
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,996
Good. And who's rich?

63
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,036
Oh, I know that one.

64
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,236
(Yentl) He who is content with what he has.

65
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,231
Yentl, is dinner ready?

66
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,393
Yes, he who has a full heart
and he who is content with what he has.

67
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,438
(David) How can one question
have two answers?

68
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:25,435
Ah, David, sometimes there are
many answers to the same question.

69
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,431
Now, the last one.

70
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,273
- Who is strong?
- Erm...

71
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,430
- Strong...
- No, no. Who is strong?

72
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,671
- He who controls his passions.
- Concentrate.

73
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,273
Controls his passions!

74
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,316
- Try, David.
- I'm trying.

75
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,550
- He who...
- He who controls his passions!

76
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,111
Yentl knows Talmud?

77
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,794
I think that's enough for today.

78
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,350
My father says that a woman
who studies Talmud is a demon.

79
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,195
She's not a demon, she just has big ears.
So you don't need to tell your father.

80
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,192
- Goodbye, Reb Mendel.
- Goodbye.

81
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,475
Bye, David.

82
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,995
Now the whole village
will be talking about us.

83
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,718
Papa, you shouldn’t smoke.

84
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,759
Do you think the angel of death will be
frightened away by cough medicine?

85
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,278
- First, you don't have to drown him in it.
- Again.

86
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,148
- Second, he's beginning to Like it.
- You want some more?

87
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,676
You know something?

88
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,228
Baked apple is good a little burnt.

89
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,793
- I'm sorry, Papa.
- No. I Like it this way.

90
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,269
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

91
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,076
Go on, your move.

92
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,070
- Papa?
- Mm?

93
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,596
Why does every bookseller
have the same argument?

94
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,275
- You know why.
- I envy them.

95
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,432
- The booksellers?
- No, the students!

96
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,229
Talking about life, the universe.
I learn how to tell a herring from a carp!

97
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,438
Yentl, for the thousandth time,
men and women have different obligations.

98
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,034
- I know, but...
- And don't ask why.

99
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,749
Go on. Get the books.

100
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,352
- Get the books.
- Thank you, Papa.

101
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,876
(Papa) ''Thank you, Papa.
Thank you, Papa. ''

102
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,077
- The shutters, darling.
- The shutters.

103
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,596
If you don't hide my studying from God,
why from the neighbors?

104
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,389
I trust God will understand.
I'm not so sure about the neighbors.

105
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,631
Questions, questions,
even when you were Little.

106
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,757
''Does a goat have a soul?
What was before the universe?''

107
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,195
- I'd Like to know.
- Oy!

108
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,268
- Where were we?
- Hillel's argument. Erm...

109
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,874
Hillel’s argument that knowledge...

110
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,189
Papa?

111
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,551
- Papa?
- (Mumbles)

112
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:03,189
Papa, I'm... I'm a Little tired tonight.

113
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,434
Do you mind? We'll study tomorrow.

114
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,712
Tomorrow.

115
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,790
Oh, Yentl, Yentl.

116
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,350
Oy. You're such a comfort to me.

117
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:23,389
But you should have a young man to take
care of you, one who doesn't Like to eat.

118
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,436
- Good night.
- Good night, Papa.

119
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,317
(Coughing)

120
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,834
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

121
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,796
(Coughing quietly)

122
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,396
(Papa coughing quietly)

123
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,394
God,

124
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,550
O merciful father,

125
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,314
I am wrapped in a robe of light,

126
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,236
clothed in your glory

127
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,198
that spreads its wings over my soul.

128
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,596
May I be worthy.

129
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:47,068
* Amen *

130
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,230
* There's not a morning I begin

131
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,276
* Without a thousand questions

132
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,797
* Running through my mind

133
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:06,078
* That I don't try to find
the reason and the logic

134
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,789
* In the world that God designed

135
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,030
* The reason why

136
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,910
* A bird was given wings

137
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,719
* If not to fly

138
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,870
* And praise the sky

139
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:26,715
* With every song it sings

140
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,392
* What's right or wrong

141
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,994
* Where I belong

142
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:39,952
* Within the scheme of things... *

143
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,349
(Papa coughing)

144
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,392
* And why have eyes that see
and arms that reach

145
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:59,191
* Unless you're meant to know
there's something more?

146
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,999
* lf not to hunger
for the meaning of it all

147
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,709
* Then tell me what a soul is for

148
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,756
* Why have the wings

149
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:12,152
* Unless you're meant to fly?

150
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,791
* And tell me, please, why have a mind

151
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:22,830
* lf not to question why?

152
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,799
* And tell me where

153
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,510
* Where is it written
what is it I'm meant to be

154
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,398
* That I can't dare

155
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,349
* To have the chance
to pick the fruit of every tree

156
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,115
* Or have my share

157
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,910
* Of every sweet imagined possibility?

158
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,269
* Just tell me where

159
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,517
* Tell me where

160
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,756
* If I were only meant to tend the nest

161
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:09,153
* Then why does my imagination sail

162
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,435
* Across the mountains and the seas

163
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:15,559
* Beyond the make-believe
of any fairy tale?

164
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,596
* Why have the thirst

165
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,797
* If not to drink the wine?

166
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,314
* And what a waste

167
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,356
* To have a taste

168
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,355
* Of things that can't be mine

169
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,069
* And tell me where

170
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,392
* Where is it written
what it is I'm meant to be

171
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,438
* That I can't dare

172
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:45,991
* To find the meanings
in the mornings that I see

173
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:50,119
* Or have my share

174
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:55,149
* Of every sweet imagined possibility? *

175
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,153
Papa!

176
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,470
* Just tell me where

177
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,109
* Where is it written?

178
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,431
* Tell me where... *

179
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,590
Are you all right?

180
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:15,949
* Or if it's written

181
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:25,672
* Anywhere... *

182
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,150
(Woman) Did you hear?
Yentl is learning Talmud!

183
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,913
- It's true.
- David's mother told me.

184
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,594
She should Learn how to get a husband.

185
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,113
(Coughing)

186
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:41,115
He came all the way from Riga to see you.
Why won't you at least meet him?

187
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,158
- What for?
- I want to dance at your wedding!

188
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,993
- I want to see you happy.
- I'm happy with you, Papa.

189
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:51,278
I don't want to get married, to bear children
and darn my husband's socks.

190
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,956
You want a husband who will darn
your socks and bear your children?

191
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:01,595
Go on, turn the world upside down.
You won't have a moment's peace.

192
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,274
Children are more important
than the Talmud.

193
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:09,309
Without children to pass it on to, the
Talmud dies with old men when they die.

194
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,358
- I'm sorry.
- I'm the one who's sorry.

195
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,989
You're a woman
but I didn't teach you how to be one.

196
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,598
- You taught me everything I know.
- Too much.

197
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,433
You know too much, but not enough.

198
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,357
- And it's my fault.
- Papa, don't say that.

199
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,797
Learning is my whole Life.
Please don't be sorry. I'm not.

200
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,870
- What is it?
- That tree.

201
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:49,991
That tree was this high when your brother
Anshel died, may he rest in peace.

202
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,631
You were only a baby, could hardily talk,
let alone ask why.

203
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,712
And now look, look how it's grown.

204
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,834
Too late to tell you to play with dolls, huh?

205
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,273
I love you, Papa.

206
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,030
Hear me, O Lord, master of the universe.

207
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,998
Thou hast given me a daughter

208
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,719
who brings me great pride

209
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,556
and pleasure.

210
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,275
And for this kindness,

211
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,590
I thank thee forever and ever.

212
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,636
What's to become of you, Yentl?

213
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,596
(Crows cawing)

214
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,917
Come, Yentl.

215
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,876
You must tear it over your heart.

216
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,034
- Good.
- (Rabbi) Who will say Kaddish?

217
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,793
- I will.
- It has to be a male relative.

218
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:22,079
- (Reading in Hebrew)
- (Mourners muttering)

219
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,116
(Woman) May God forgive her.

220
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,033
(Reading continues)

221
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,200
(Mourners pray)

222
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,639
My house is hers as long as she wants.

223
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,554
She'll help in the store,
look after the children, cook...

224
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,837
- Yentl, eat.
- (Woman muttering)

225
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,435
It's enough.
We mourn for seven days only.

226
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,476
Then Life goes on.

227
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,959
Ah!

228
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,553
Sorry.

229
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:01,193
Razel, Sarah, I think maybe
we come back later.

230
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,236
(Woman chatting quietly)

231
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,630
(Woman) Get your things, Yentl.
I'll come back for you Later.

232
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,110
I'll keep you so busy,
you won't have time to think.

233
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,791
Forgive me, Papa.

234
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,639
Wait!

235
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,676
- Wait. Stop!
- Whoa!

236
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,955
- (Neighing)
- What do you want, boy?

237
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,110
Could you give me a ride to the next town?

238
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,112
- You got money?
- Er, a Little.

239
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,955
- Get in back.
- Thank you.

240
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,708
- Yah!
- Where do you think you're going?

241
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,870
- (Laughter)
- Get off of here.

242
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,952
- Go find another wagon.
- Wait! Please wait!

243
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,276
(Laughter continues)

244
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,316
(Animal shrieks)

245
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:46,355
* God

246
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,591
* Our heavenly father

247
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:57,028
* O God

248
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,997
* And my father, who's also in heaven

249
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,829
* May the Light

250
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,832
* Of this flickering candle

251
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:12,277
* Illuminate the night
the way your spirit

252
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:23,430
* Illuminates my soul

253
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,396
* Papa...

254
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,835
* Can you hear me?

255
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,668
* Papa, can you see me?

256
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,678
* Papa, can you find me in the night?

257
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,751
* Papa, are you near me?

258
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,956
* Papa, can you hear me?

259
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:53,115
* Papa, can you help me
not be frightened?

260
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,512
* Looking at the skies

261
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,750
* I seem to see a million eyes

262
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:03,233
* Which ones are yours?

263
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,517
* Where are you now that yesterday
has waved goodbye

264
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,717
* And closed its doors?

265
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,395
* The night is so much darker

266
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,790
* The wind is so much colder

267
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,838
* The world I see is so much bigger

268
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,993
* Now that I'm alone

269
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,709
* Papa, please forgive me

270
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,268
* Try to understand me

271
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:35,070
* Papa, don't you know I had no choice?

272
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,754
* Can you hear me praying

273
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,070
* Anything I'm saying

274
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:45,792
* Even though the night
is filled with voices?

275
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,235
* I remember everything you taught me

276
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:55,351
* Every book I've ever read

277
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,396
* Can all the words in all the books

278
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,439
* Help me to face what lies ahead?

279
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,149
* The trees are so much taller

280
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,755
* And I feel so much smaller

281
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,308
* The moon is twice as lonely

282
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:16,679
* And the stars are half as bright

283
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,955
* Papa, how I Love you

284
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,873
* Papa, how I need you

285
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,999
* Papa, how I miss you

286
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:53,189
* Kissing me good night *

287
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,472
If I am not for myself, who will be for me?

288
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,792
(Lowers pitch) Who will be for me?
(Coughs)

289
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,711
Who will be for me?

290
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:19,110
If I am for myself alone, who am I?
(Lower) Who am I?

291
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,396
And if not now...

292
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,438
- (Horse neighing in distance)
- . . when?

293
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,397
(Yentl) Wait!

294
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,880
(Child shouting)

295
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,390
- (Lively chatter)
- (Man) Innkeeper, more soup!

296
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,995
(Chatter continues, men singing)

297
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,959
(Man) Did you hear that?
(2nd man) Yes. I hear, I hear.

298
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,349
(Singing continues)

299
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,396
(Man) Who's throwing that?

300
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,188
Don't throw that. I told you not to.

301
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,352
- Watch out!
- (Man) Lithuania, Poland, same thing.

302
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,230
A school is a school. It's only the rabbis
that are different. The girls...

303
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,469
- Why would the Talmud repeat itself?
- It's an improper translation.

304
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:04,075
- Even if they contradict each other?
- Avigdor, what do you think?

305
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,835
The Talmud recognizes
Life is filled with contradiction.

306
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,150
- You see? He agrees.
- Your move.

307
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,756
- Ah!
- What?

308
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,673
- Nothing, sorry.
- No, go on.

309
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,594
It's just that, erm, if you move your castle

310
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,035
- to queen 7...
- Yes?

311
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,796
His knight is pinned. That's all.

312
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,910
You don't know what you're talking about.

313
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,956
No. Sorry.

314
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:39,795
(Youth) Stop yelling at me, Papa.
(Man) I'm not yelling!

315
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,559
Checkmate.

316
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,833
The Long diagonal. Who knew?

317
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,150
You should’ve listened to him.

318
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,629
Chaim, catch!

319
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,996
- You want a bite?
- No, thank you.

320
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,516
- Don't play.
- Hey, you. You.

321
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,875
- Sit down.
- Why?

322
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,956
Because I said so.

323
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,035
Five kopecks if you win.
Pay me one if you lose.

324
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,076
What do I have to do?

325
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,230
Whoever forces
the other's hand down wins.

326
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,709
- No, thanks.
- Ready? Go!

327
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,756
(Grunts)

328
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,992
Wasn't it Rabbi Akiva who said,
''The true strength of a man... ''

329
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,275
One kopeck.

330
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,989
''. . Lies in his ability to stretch
the narrowest mind''? Thank you.

331
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:36,153
You're welcome.
Now you can stretch my mind again.

332
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,558
Go.

333
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,108
I think Rabbi Akiva also said...

334
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,599
Two kopecks.

335
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:46,309
- I thought it was one.
- Mm. But I beat you I twice.

336
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,277
Oh.

337
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,156
Give him back his money.

338
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,471
- Why?
- Because I said so.

339
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,312
Because you said so.

340
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,958
I'll see you Later when your beard
starts to grow. Mama's boy.

341
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,559
- No, it wasn't, since you ask.
- Hm?

342
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,677
Rabbi Akiva. ''The narrowest mind. ''

343
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,832
Oh. Er, was it Rabbi Eliezer?

344
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,876
No, Rabbi Israel Salanter.

345
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,076
Rabbi Israel Salanter.

346
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,390
My brother didn't have one either.

347
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,232
What?

348
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,636
- Are you hungry?
- A Little.

349
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,632
- Help yourself.
- Yes, please.

350
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,756
Which yeshiva are you going to?

351
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,549
I haven't decided. Someplace quiet.

352
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,232
A quiet yeshiva?

353
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,993
- Bechev's the best.
- (Man) Well, the nearest.

354
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,638
That's where we study.

355
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,598
Well, I just count the days till I go home.

356
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,672
His parents count
the days until he goes back.

357
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,548
Our rabbi's a genius.
Rabbi Zalman? Maybe you've heard of him.

358
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,392
I think so.

359
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,516
In one answer, he settles ten questions.

360
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,716
Papa had 10 questions for every answer.

361
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,199
Had?

362
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,352
He died eight days ago,
may he rest in peace.

363
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,589
You're in mourning too.

364
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,636
My brother.

365
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,190
Almost a month now. May he rest in peace.

366
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,956
I'm Shimmele, by the way.

367
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,076
- Oh.
- (Both) Hello.

368
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,033
- And you?
- What?

369
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,076
What's your name?

370
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,232
- My name?
- Name.

371
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,074
Um...

372
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:36,675
Anshel. That's it.
That's my name. My name is Anshel.

373
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,955
Good. You know your own name.

374
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,996
You're as good a scholar as I am.

375
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,355
- This is Avigdor.
- I know.

376
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,789
- I mean, hello.
- (Man) Boys!

377
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:52,352
Wagons to the north and west leaving now.
And now means now!

378
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,317
Goodbye.

379
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,356
Anshel.

380
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,715
(Lively chatter)

381
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,516
(Chicken clucking)

382
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,078
Anshel!

383
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,833
Hey, are you deaf? Anshel!

384
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,672
Anshel. Yes?

385
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,830
There's room if you're still undecided.

386
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,717
I just decided.

387
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,598
(* Men singing and clapping)

388
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:29,189
* He tells him there's a fisherman
who's got the strongest rod

389
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,316
* The cod he catches are so big

390
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,038
* And when they see
his cod they scream! *

391
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,839
- Where you from, Anshel?
- Erm...

392
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,992
A Little village
you've never heard of. Yanev.

393
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:42,595
Yanev? I have relatives in Yanev.
A third cousin.

394
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,636
- We moved.
- What?

395
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,676
(Yentl) Years ago.

396
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,638
- You have relatives in Riga?
- Riga?

397
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,519
- No.
- Now we live in Riga.

398
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,031
Oh.

399
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:04,630
(Avigdor) Were you close?
(Yentl) He was my father and teacher.

400
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,110
(Avigdor) What more could you ask?
(Yentl) What about your brother?

401
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,156
- We were brothers.
- Older? Younger?

402
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,674
- Younger, about your age.
- What happened?

403
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,671
Pneumonia.

404
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,591
Sorry.

405
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,716
Would you Like to discuss
a page of Talmud?

406
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,075
- Oh, no, not Talmud.
- Which?

407
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:29,756
- Whatever you're reading.
- I'll state the premise. You dispute it.

408
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,115
- When does day become night?
- (Yentl) Sundown.

409
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,237
- (Avigdor) When is sundown?
- When you see three stars.

410
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,276
Not precise enough. When's dusk?

411
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,828
- When the light's no longer blue.
- That's twilight.

412
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:51,277
- Twilight is when objects are silhouettes.
- Be quiet for five minutes!

413
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,397
There's Bechev! We're home!

414
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,710
(Lively chatter)

415
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,796
(Yentl) How do I get into this yeshiva?

416
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,635
(Avigdor) Rabbi Zalman tests you on what
you know or what you think you know.

417
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,075
(Yentl) Can I live at this Yeshiva?

418
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:17,314
(Avigdor) No, but you'll find lodgings.
There may be a room where I stay.

419
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,836
(Man) I'm starving.
(2nd man) You're always starving.

420
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,555
- (Yentl) Wait for me!
- You walk too slow.

421
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,791
- (Yentl) You walk too fast.
- The synagogue's to the left,

422
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,633
the yeshiva's straight ahead,
I live around the corner.

423
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,598
- (Knock on door)
- Who is it?

424
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,592
- (Avigdor) It's me.
- Avigdor?

425
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,989
How many other boyfriends do you have?

426
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,150
I'm so glad you're back!

427
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,993
- (Laughs) Are you all right?
- Yes, yes.

428
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,036
When you see Hadass you’ll feel better.

429
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,395
Who wants other girls when I've got you?

430
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,155
- Shame! A wicked tongue.
- I want you to meet my friend, Anshel.

431
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,391
- Anshel, Mrs Jacobs.
- Good evening.

432
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,909
- Anshel?
- Do you have a room for him?

433
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,560
Oh, I'm sorry, dear, not tonight.

434
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,598
My niece is here,
but she leaves tomorrow.

435
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:08,434
- All right, he can share my bed.
- (Yentl) No, I can't.

436
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,909
Why not?

437
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,150
- I don't want to impose.
- Don't be silly.

438
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:16,755
- I'm a restless sleeper.
- That's all right. I snore.

439
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,796
(Avigdor) Come on.

440
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,632
Young.

441
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,834
Anshel, will you put out the lamp?

442
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:38,397
I can't. I'm being tested
by the rabbi tomorrow.

443
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,359
So? You're going to Learn the entire
Talmud by heart overnight?

444
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,590
All 2, 555 pages?

445
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,319
- You're tired, you sleep.
- I'm exhausted.

446
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:51,075
I've been in the wagon all day,
all I want to do is sleep.

447
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,230
Get in bed.

448
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,436
- Would you Like to talk a Little?
- Bed.

449
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:59,069
- Why don't I just...
- Get in bed.

450
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,756
So, er...

451
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,360
- Who's Hadass?
- Hm?

452
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,393
- Mrs Jacobs mentioned...
- For God's sake!

453
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,597
Sorry. It doesn't matter.
Go back to sleep.

454
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,396
The girl I'm engaged to.

455
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,638
Oh.

456
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,836
- (Thud)
- Sorry.

457
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:37,718
- Oh, it's your suitcase.
- (Sighs)

458
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,999
Is she, er, pretty, this Hadass?

459
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,433
No.

460
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,431
Beautiful.

461
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,951
What color hair does she have?

462
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:00,271
I dine at her house every Tuesday.
I'll take you.

463
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,119
Thank you.

464
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,156
(Avigdor sighs)

465
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:10,275
- Red.
- Hm. Red, huh?

466
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:13,033
- Will you get into bed?
- Sure.

467
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,996
You’ll fall off the edge.

468
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,395
I always sleep Like this.

469
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,789
- Why?
- Why?

470
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,956
I... I think it's written.

471
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,993
What is?

472
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:51,470
Two bachelors in the same bed
must lie back to back.

473
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,392
- Really?
- Really.

474
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,436
So turn over, please.

475
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,118
Why'd you have to talk about Hadass?

476
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,316
Now I'll never get to sleep.

477
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,753
Why not?

478
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,957
Don't you ever think sinful thoughts?

479
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,712
- No.
- No?

480
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,836
- Yes!
- Don't be so nervous.

481
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,876
Why should I be nervous?

482
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,119
You're being tested
by the rabbi tomorrow.

483
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,634
Mm. Mm.

484
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,992
Good night.

485
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,754
Good night.

486
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,668
(Lively chatter)

487
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:54,954
No, Anshel, the point of study is
to teach us how to Live, not only to study.

488
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,156
- Why?
- Again, ''Why?''

489
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,596
My father quoted Hillel, who said... May I?

490
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:03,956
- Hillel said, ''May I?''
- No, may I quote Hillel?

491
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,393
Quote, quote.

492
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:10,634
''He that increases wisdom increases Life. ''
Wisdom is the most important thing.

493
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,676
Only as the means to an end.

494
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,797
Wisdom is the means.
Living is the end.

495
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,633
Then, may I ask you another question?

496
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,597
Ask, ask.

497
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:25,470
If he that increases study increases
wisdom, and therefore Life, then...

498
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,278
You can't just grab it...

499
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,715
That's not it. You can do it, so Long as...

500
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:33,634
(Man) That's why the rabbi says
you must use the Left side.

501
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,073
Well?

502
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,390
I don't know. He just said to me...

503
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:42,439
- He asks a Lot of questions.
- Sorry, I've been told that before.

504
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,557
It's by their questions
that we choose our students,

505
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,995
not only by their answers.

506
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,152
Your father taught you well, Anshel.

507
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,196
Welcome to our yeshiva.

508
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,035
I'm accepted?

509
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,236
- I'm a student?
- Mazel tov.

510
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,072
I'm a student.

511
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,549
And now, a study partner for him.

512
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,160
* There are moments

513
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,118
* You remember all your life... *

514
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,633
Mazel tov, Anshel.

515
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:19,077
* There are moments
you wait for and dream of

516
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,720
* All your life

517
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:28,399
* This is one of those moments

518
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:33,109
* I will always remember this chair

519
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,350
* That window

520
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:40,195
* The way the light streams in... *

521
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,838
He's too advanced for them.

522
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,354
* The clothes I’m wearing

523
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,557
- * The words I’m hearing... *
- Too advanced for Yessel.

524
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,995
- * The face I’m seeing... *
- So who?

525
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,389
* The feeling I’m feeling... *

526
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,199
- Me?
- You?

527
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,714
My chickens are too advanced for you.

528
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,559
Thank you.

529
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,837
- Avigdor?
- *. . will be written in my heart... *

530
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,388
There's only me
who is too advanced for him.

531
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:14,878
- * As long as I live... *
- (Zalman) It's up to you.

532
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,916
We’ll see.

533
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,758
* I can travel the past and take what I need

534
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,593
* To see me through the years

535
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,638
* What my father learned
and his father before him

536
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,393
* Will be there for my eyes and ears

537
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,392
* I can walk through the forests
of the trees of knowledge

538
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,074
* And listen to the lesson of the leaves

539
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:38,277
* I can enter rooms
where there are rooms within rooms

540
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,113
* Wrapped in a shawl that learning weaves

541
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,350
* I remember, Papa

542
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,591
* Everything you've taught me

543
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:49,194
* What you gave me, Papa

544
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,317
* Look at what it's brought me

545
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,994
* There are certain things
that once you have

546
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,958
* No man can take away

547
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,713
* No wave can wash away

548
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,314
* No wind can blow away

549
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:08,554
* And now they're about to be mine

550
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,760
* No tide can turn away

551
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,638
* No fire can burn away

552
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:18,554
* No time can wear away... *

553
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,676
(All shouting)

554
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,834
* I can open doors, take from the shelves

555
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,559
* All the books I've longed to hold

556
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,393
* I can ask all the questions,
the whys and the wheres

557
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,835
* As the mysteries of life unfold

558
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,196
* Like a link in a chain
from the past to the future

559
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,794
* Joins me with the children yet to be

560
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,553
* I can now be a part of the ongoing stream

561
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,835
* That has always been

562
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,878
* A part of me

563
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,952
* There are certain things
that once you have

564
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,395
* No man can take away

565
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,029
* No wave can wash away

566
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:07,396
* No wind can blow away... *

567
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,675
Anshel, come down.

568
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,832
* No fire can burn away

569
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,629
* No time can wear away... *

570
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:22,352
Where in the Talmud does it say,
''possession is nine tenths of the Law''?

571
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,158
Shimmele.

572
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,674
- Er... Yebamot?
- No.

573
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,479
- No, it's Baba Metzia.
- No!

574
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,068
- It's Baba Kama, page 29a.
- No!

575
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,674
Forgive me. It's Baba Kama, but it's 31b.

576
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,955
- * There are moments... *
- Anshel is right.

577
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:41,237
*. . you remember all your life

578
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:46,753
* There are moments
you wait for and dream of

579
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,798
* All your life

580
00:40:51,240 --> 00:41:00,148
* This is one of those moments *

581
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,795
(Crystals tinkling)

582
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,193
(Clock chiming)

583
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,153
(Muffled chatter, crystals tinkling)

584
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,919
(Yentl) Mm...

585
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,432
Perfect.

586
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,592
Beautiful.

587
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:02,958
Congratulations, Anshel.
Accepted in a fine yeshiva.

588
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:06,874
- Your father would be proud.
- I hope so.

589
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,157
- He was a scholar too?
- Yes, yes, he was.

590
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,596
Now his son after him.
May your father rest in peace.

591
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,432
(Both) May he rest in peace.

592
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,829
Avigdor's brother too. He told you?

593
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,399
Um, yes, he did.

594
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,948
Consumption, a terrible thing.

595
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,632
Esther!

596
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,632
- At our table, two scholars waiting.
- I'm coming.

597
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:31,076
I'd Like to have a toast
to the new yeshiva boy.

598
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:35,073
- Lechaim.
- (Both) Lechaim.

599
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:38,357
- How was the fish, boys?
- Delicious.

600
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:41,079
- Hadass made it.
- It's Avigdor's favorite.

601
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:44,436
(Reb Alter) I hope so.
We get it every Tuesday!

602
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,318
It's very good. It's good fish.

603
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:51,393
You have a lovely home, Mrs Vishkower.

604
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,471
Such beautiful things,

605
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:56,438
the silver, the dishes, the tablecloth.

606
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:59,353
Thank you, Anshel.
It's nice of you to notice.

607
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,351
Oh! I'm sorry.

608
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,516
It's all right.

609
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,715
You, erm, you come from a big family?

610
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,678
- No.
- No brothers or sisters?

611
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,796
- No.
- Your father never remarried?

612
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,632
- No.
- Esther.

613
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:18,678
I'm just curious. Who took care of them?

614
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:22,799
If I knew Talmud the way my wife
knows everybody's business,

615
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,871
I'd be the sage of all sages.

616
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,911
(Esther) Don't you pay any attention.

617
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,358
* No wonder he loves her

618
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:37,069
* No wonder at all

619
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:42,318
* The moment she sees him

620
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,676
* Her thought is to please him... *

621
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,318
Horseradish is good for you.

622
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,231
* Before he even knows that he's hungry

623
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,515
* She's already there with his plate

624
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:54,160
* Before his glass is even empty
she's filling it up

625
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,515
* God forbid he should wait... *

626
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:02,152
* Before he has the chance to tell her
he's chilly she'll go put a log on the fire

627
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:06,950
* Fulfilling his every desire

628
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,156
* No trouble

629
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,992
* No bother... *

630
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:13,150
- Carrots?
- No, thank you.

631
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:16,038
* No wonder

632
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,156
* She's pretty

633
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:22,597
* What else should she be?

634
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:26,468
* She hasn't a worry

635
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:30,838
* And why should she worry?

636
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,672
* When she gets up, her biggest decision

637
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,591
* Is figuring out what to wear

638
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:37,069
* To pick a blouse, a skirt,
and then there's the problem

639
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,718
* Of what should she do with her hair

640
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,394
* And later as she stands
and studies a chicken

641
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:44,233
* The question's to roast
or to not roast

642
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:48,710
* Or better yet, maybe a pot roast

643
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,752
* Tomatoes?

644
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,193
* No... *

645
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:54,475
- Potatoes.
- Mm.

646
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,313
* No wonder

647
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,197
* He likes it

648
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:03,193
* It's perfect this way

649
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,192
* Who wouldn't want someone
who fusses and flatters

650
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:08,669
* Who makes you feel
that you're all that matters

651
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:11,957
* Whose only aim in life is to serve you

652
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:18,513
* And make you think
she doesn't deserve you?

653
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:21,114
- * No wonder... *
- It's all right.

654
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,873
- *. . he loves her... *
- It happens.

655
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,239
- * What else could he do? *
- All the time. Ha-ha!

656
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,517
* lf I were a man

657
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,391
* I would too *

658
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,835
- (Esther) Let's try dessert.
- Yes, Mother.

659
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,273
Good, hm?

660
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,192
(Both chuckling)

661
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,236
Let's go this way.

662
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:50,871
- She makes the best almond cakes.
- Mm.

663
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,315
- I thought it was pneumonia.
- Hm?

664
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,231
- Your brother.
- It was.

665
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:59,833
- Vishkower said consumption.
- Did he?

666
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:03,752
They were very impressed with you.

667
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,229
''Beautiful dishes, beautiful home. ''

668
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:11,469
I didn't open my mouth
the first two months except to eat.

669
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,236
Is she always that nervous?

670
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:16,958
She's a girl...

671
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,429
in Love. What do you expect?

672
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:22,796
She doesn't say very much.

673
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,836
What does she have to say?

674
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:28,358
Don't you ever wonder
what she's thinking?

675
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,237
No.

676
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:33,073
- What could she be thinking?
- (Yentl laughs)

677
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:36,630
I don't need her to think.
I can do that with you.

678
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:40,952
Wrong. The Hebrew for rib
never meant rib, it meant side.

679
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,996
Rib, side, what's the difference?

680
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:45,036
Adam was created male and female.

681
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:47,350
- Where's that written?
- Genesis, chapter five.

682
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:53,310
If God took one side of Adam and created
woman, that means we're all the same.

683
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,356
You've never been with a woman.

684
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:59,035
I mean they share masculine
and feminine qualities.

685
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:01,759
- Look, can you do that?
- What?

686
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:06,436
Create Life, give birth to sons?
When you can, then tell me we're the same.

687
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:09,398
Another interpretation,
the true story of Adam and Eve -

688
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:14,759
God wouldn’t make her from Adam's ear
Lest she be an eavesdropper.

689
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:16,956
Nor from his heart, lest she be jealous.

690
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:20,237
But from a hidden part of the body,
so she be modest.

691
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:23,710
- In other words, the rib!
- No, no, not the rib!

692
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,916
- Side!
- Rib!

693
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,913
- Side!
- Rib. Admit you're wrong.

694
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,232
- Admit it. Admit it!
- I will not! I'm not wrong!

695
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:37,153
- Admit it!
- Get off! I can't breathe!

696
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:40,710
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

697
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:47,436
Come on.

698
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,030
- Where are you going?
- Come on!

699
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,672
Avigdor, wait!

700
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,309
- Avigdor!
- (Children laughing)

701
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,594
- Avigdor, where are you?
- Over here!

702
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,592
- Come on in.
- Oh, my God.

703
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,750
(Men chatting, indistinct)

704
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:32,548
- Come on in!
- No! Er...

705
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,756
There's a passage here that, erm...

706
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:37,877
- It's the only way to cool off!
- No, it's all right.

707
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,554
I'll, er... I'll watch the clothes.

708
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,949
(Man) Don't throw me in the water.

709
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,395
(Indistinct shouting)

710
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:53,512
Shimmele, come on in!

711
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,592
(Lively shouts)

712
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,508
(Laughter and chatter)

713
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:05,639
- (Man) How's the water?
- It's good. It's fun.

714
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,995
It feels wonderful. Whoo!

715
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,998
- You're really missing something.
- Am I?

716
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:14,833
- (Sighs) The water's perfect.
- Is it?

717
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,710
- Here, your pants.
- What a day.

718
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,678
- Put on your pants.
- What a pleasure!

719
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:25,036
- It must be a sin.
- It couldn’t be.

720
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:27,475
Anshel! Come on in!

721
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:31,155
- That's enough studying!
- No, no, it's too cold.

722
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:35,038
- The water's warm.
- No, I catch cold easily.

723
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:37,680
That's not the reason.
Why didn't you tell me?

724
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,069
- What?
- You can't swim.

725
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:44,469
I can't swim. That's right. I can't swim.
I can't swim!

726
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:48,519
Neither can I.
That's why I stay where it's shallow.

727
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,556
- Come on, I'll teach you.
- No.

728
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:53,393
- Don't be afraid.
- No! I don't Like swimming!

729
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:57,553
- Take off your clothes.
- No! Stop it! Please, stop it!

730
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:00,393
- Are you ashamed? Embarrassed?
- I don't want to!

731
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,471
- All right!
- I don't want to!

732
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:05,870
All right, all right. If you're that scared...

733
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,510
I'm not going to force you.

734
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,596
- Next time.
- Sure.

735
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,436
When you're ready.

736
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,916
* There's no chill

737
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,436
* And yet I shiver

738
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:35,477
* There's no flame and yet I burn

739
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:40,031
* I’m not sure what I’m afraid of

740
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:46,309
* And yet I’m trembling

741
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:51,833
* There's no storm, yet I hear thunder

742
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,071
* And I'm breathless, why, I wonder

743
00:50:55,160 --> 00:51:02,191
* Weak one moment
then the next I'm fine

744
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:06,671
* I feel as if I'm falling
every time I close my eyes

745
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:11,754
* And flowing through my body
is a river of surprise

746
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,831
* Feelings are awakening

747
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:26,230
* I hardily recognize as mine

748
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:31,592
* What are all these new sensations?

749
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:36,916
* What's the secret they reveal?

750
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:41,915
* I'm not sure I understand

751
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:51,272
* But I Like the way I feel

752
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:08,073
* La la, la la

753
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,198
* Oh, why is it that
every time I close my eyes he's there?

754
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:32,239
* The water shining on his skin,
the sunlight in his hair

755
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:34,788
* And all the while I'm thinking things

756
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:48,032
* That I can never share with him

757
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:52,432
* I'm a bundle of confusion

758
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:57,951
* Yet it has a strange appeal

759
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:03,953
* Did it all begin with him

760
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:14,393
* And the way he makes me feel?

761
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:24,276
* I Like the way

762
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:41,711
* He makes me feel *

763
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:46,912
(Sighs)

764
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:08,229
(Man) Which is the greater crime,
stealing by day or by night?

765
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,595
- (2nd man) By day.
- By night.

766
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:21,400
- What's wrong?
- That's what I wanna know.

767
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:25,837
Every morning, you exhaust
the five books of Moses

768
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:29,469
and the entire mystery of
the universe. This morning, nothing.

769
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:31,915
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

770
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:37,518
Just Like my brother. In a world of your
own, not speaking your mind, moody.

771
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,750
- Who's moody?
- Worried about something?

772
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:41,432
- No.
- Studies?

773
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:44,034
I'm your study partner. Tell me if you are.

774
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:48,750
With me sitting next to you, why worry?
I know. I'll take you to the matchmaker.

775
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:52,628
- I'm not going to any matchmaker.
- She’ll give you something nice.

776
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,676
Excuse me, gentlemen.

777
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,552
Thank you, Sophie.

778
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:59,596
Avigdor, please.

779
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:03,316
My future father-in-Law wants to see me.

780
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,595
- We're going tonight.
- No, now.

781
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:08,752
- What for?
- Dowry, wedding ceremony...

782
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:11,877
- the wedding night!
- Why do you keep grabbing me?

783
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:13,951
What?

784
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:16,190
You're always grabbing me.

785
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:19,629
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

786
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:22,955
So? Everything has to have a reason?

787
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:28,796
The wedding night!

788
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:39,877
(Bell ringing)

789
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,475
Hello, Sophie. Is Avigdor here?

790
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:03,075
Erm, he, er...

791
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:04,878
Excuse me.

792
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,315
(Muffled sobbing)

793
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,276
What's... what's wrong?

794
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:23,429
- (Sobbing)
- What's the matter?

795
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:27,672
Anshel, I'm sorry. You're still welcome,
no matter what's happened.

796
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,035
Sophie will get you something to eat.

797
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:32,395
- (Sobbing)
- Where's Avigdor?

798
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:35,276
Excuse me, Reb Alter, but...

799
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:39,278
(Esther) Hadass, sweetheart,
try to understand.

800
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:47,358
Avigdor.

801
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:49,877
I just came from...

802
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,112
What happened?

803
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,395
The wedding's off.

804
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:58,715
Why?

805
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:02,509
He says I have the evil eye,
says melancholy runs in our blood.

806
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:03,953
What are you saying?

807
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:07,919
No man can Let his daughter
marry into a family Like that.

808
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:12,353
Avigdor, what are you talking about?

809
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:14,795
- They found out.
- What?

810
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:17,519
- About my brother.
- What about him?

811
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,478
He didn't die of pneumonia
or consumption.

812
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:22,516
He committed suicide.

813
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,876
Oh, my God.

814
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:27,712
So no wedding.

815
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:29,518
No sons.

816
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,436
What's all this for?

817
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:37,274
- Did you talk to Hadass?
- What for?

818
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:39,669
She loves you, she'll still marry you.

819
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:43,230
- Not if her parents say no.
- If she thinks her parents are wrong...

820
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:46,278
She's a woman! She can't think for herself.

821
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:48,316
That's nonsense!

822
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,356
You want a philosophical argument?

823
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:54,513
I've lost the one girl
that I've ever loved, that I'll ever Love!

824
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:03,796
You’ll fall in Love again.

825
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:08,833
No.

826
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:13,794
Hadass is a nice girl but don't make her
into more than she is.

827
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:15,632
I'm not.

828
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:18,516
She was exactly what I wanted.

829
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:32,476
Please go.

830
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:35,313
(Thunder)

831
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,512
I'm sorry.

832
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,875
Is this really happening, Anshel?

833
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,357
Maybe...

834
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:49,155
someone else will turn up for you.

835
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:57,792
Maybe not... quite as pretty,

836
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:00,519
maybe with brown hair.

837
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:04,716
I wouldn’t notice her if she did.

838
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:36,951
(Thunder)

839
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,557
(Clock ticking)

840
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:33,312
(Yentl) Why punish him
for something his brother did?

841
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,879
Anshel, please.

842
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:38,077
Hadass should be proud to be his wife.

843
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,913
- Anshel.
- Love is all that matters.

844
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,150
No, there are other things.

845
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:45,310
Don't talk old wives' tales, talk the Law.

846
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:47,789
I'll talk Life!

847
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,948
What matters is a man's children.

848
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:54,635
It's his children that your Law exists for,
her children!

849
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,676
That's her only dowry.

850
01:00:56,760 --> 01:01:01,709
And my obligation as a father.
I have one daughter. I want the best for her.

851
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:05,437
Avigdor is the best.

852
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:07,636
The best scholar, maybe, the best friend.

853
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:10,795
But not the best choice.

854
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:14,270
We want someone from a good family,

855
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:18,399
someone with no secrets to hide.

856
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:20,952
Someone Like...

857
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:29,036
Someone else.

858
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:38,271
Anshel.

859
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:41,797
A Little more?

860
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:57,632
In the middle of the night,
he goes to school.

861
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:59,711
What did you have for dinner?

862
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:01,756
What did I have for dinner?

863
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,677
Very Little.

864
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:06,990
And Hadass?

865
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:09,275
She's still in Love. What do you expect?

866
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:10,952
How did she Look?

867
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,836
Not as bad as you do.

868
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:21,071
You didn't miss anything.
It was Like a madhouse.

869
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:23,390
The whole family’s going crazy.

870
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:25,436
What do you mean?

871
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:29,708
Well, it's just that... (Clears throat)

872
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:34,157
I'm sure Reb Alter... I mean, to save face,
they're going to try to marry her off...

873
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:37,676
After a broken engagement,
they have to. It's usual.

874
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:41,275
- Did they mention someone?
- No, no.

875
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:45,273
- But they were looking at me.
- You?

876
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:49,399
(Laughing) Can you imagine?

877
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:53,155
Shows you how desperate they are.
(Laughing)

878
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:57,114
(Laughter continues)

879
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:02,352
- What's the matter?
- The books.

880
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:05,633
Avigdor? What's the matter?

881
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:08,154
That's a sin! What are you doing?

882
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:11,915
Avigdor, please,
just tell me what's happening.

883
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,594
- The books!
- What?

884
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:16,910
- What are you doing?
- Where is it?

885
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,639
- What are you Looking for?
- Oh, here it is.

886
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:22,359
- What's the matter?
- Sit down. Sit.

887
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,592
I...

888
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:31,593
Anshel, I'm going to make you
the happiest man in the world.

889
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:34,956
- Yes?
- It is the Law, and it's written.

890
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:36,758
You Like everything written.

891
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:39,912
- What's written, Avigdor?
- (Speaks Hebrew)

892
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:43,316
It's perfect. We are Like brothers.

893
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:47,393
If one dies, it is the other's obligation
to marry his widow.

894
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:49,357
Who's died?

895
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:51,351
I want you to marry Hadass.

896
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:54,079
- Oh, no.
- Yes.

897
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:56,469
Never, Avigdor, I couldn’t.

898
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:58,994
- Why not?
- Why not?

899
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:01,196
- She Loves you.
- Let me explain.

900
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:03,236
I'm not your brother.

901
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:06,232
- In my eyes, you are!
- I don't want to marry her!

902
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:09,153
- I don't Love her!
- That's good!

903
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:12,994
- What are you talking about?
- Listen! It's meant to be!

904
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:14,752
Nothing's meant to be.

905
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:18,515
The thought of her with another man,
a total stranger, drives me crazy.

906
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:21,956
You marrying her would be
the nearest thing to me marrying her.

907
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:24,759
They may marry her to someone
she doesn't know!

908
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:27,593
- She could never Love me.
- She likes you.

909
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:29,750
I could see her, visit you both.

910
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:31,796
You're talking Like a madman.

911
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:35,031
If they take her away,
I'll never see her again.

912
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:37,111
- She’ll take care of you.
- No.

913
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:39,714
- Wealthy family, beautiful girl...
- No!

914
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:43,713
- Why do you have to be different?
- Please, that's enough.

915
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:47,429
Oh! What's the matter with you?
Any other man would...

916
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:52,272
Anshel, time will go by.

917
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:55,556
Tempers cool, things change.

918
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:59,956
Who knows? Perhaps even her father.

919
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:03,957
Your marriage could be dissolved.
Hadass and I could...

920
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:05,996
She means that much to you?

921
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:10,196
Who better will you find?

922
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,760
Who better will she find?

923
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:17,833
- Do it, for all of us.
- I can't! It's impossible.

924
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:19,876
Nothing's impossible.

925
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:24,076
Just think about it.

926
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:26,716
I've thought.

927
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:29,553
It's out of the question. The answer is no.

928
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:44,470
Another question.

929
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:46,516
Do you feel anything for me?

930
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:49,633
What?

931
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:51,472
Do you?

932
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:54,916
Of course I do.

933
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:58,870
Then think again.

934
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:46,554
More noodles? They're your favorite.

935
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:49,516
How do you know?

936
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:51,750
You told me Last week at dinner.

937
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:55,792
- I don't remember.
- I do.

938
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:02,596
It's a little chilly in here.

939
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:06,710
I thought it was rather warm myself.

940
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:10,156
It is warm... for this time of year.

941
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:14,438
* No wonder she suits him

942
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:18,035
* She never disputes him... *

943
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:20,076
Last year, it was also warm.

944
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:22,116
* The conversation's not too exciting

945
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:24,430
* But oh, what a change it must be

946
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:27,034
* To spend an evening
where there's no conversation

947
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:29,714
- * Must be a relief after me... *
- I'll get dessert.

948
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:32,712
* And though there's nothing much
to challenge your mind here

949
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:35,997
* Who cares when the food's so delicious?

950
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:40,198
* Not to mention these beautiful dishes

951
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:42,589
* A matched set

952
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:45,274
* From France yet... *

953
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:49,032
You Look pensive.

954
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:51,076
No, I was just thinking.

955
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:54,996
About me?

956
01:07:57,080 --> 01:07:59,036
As a matter of fact, I was.

957
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:02,636
Good thoughts, I hope.

958
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:08,278
Something smells good. What is it?

959
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:11,238
It must be the cinnamon
in the baked apple.

960
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:14,190
You bake apples too?

961
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:17,909
* No wonder he loves her

962
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:22,435
* No wonder to me... *

963
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:24,476
- A cushion?
- Why not?

964
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:27,757
* With ribbons and laces

965
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:31,389
* In all the right places... *

966
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:33,755
- Milk or lemon?
- Yes, please.

967
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:36,912
* I must admit it's all very pleasant
and this is a comfortable room... *

968
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,558
- Which?
- Which what?

969
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:40,198
* And if he likes the smell
of lilacs and roses

970
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:43,033
- * Then maybe he likes her perfume... *
- Lemon or milk?

971
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:46,032
* And though her silky hair
and milky complexion are nice

972
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:48,714
- * Still they're not that distracting... *
- Anshel?

973
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:50,472
- Milky.
- What?

974
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:51,913
Milk, milk!

975
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,037
* So what accounts
for the way he's been acting? *

976
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:58,271
- Honey?
- * Her softness... *

977
01:08:58,360 --> 01:09:01,272
- No honey.
- * Her sweetness... *

978
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:03,351
Sugar?

979
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:07,752
* How could he resist her? *

980
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:11,594
- An almond cookie?
- * And why would he try? *

981
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:13,636
How do you get them all the same size?

982
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:17,429
* No wonder he wants her... *

983
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:20,114
- You notice everything.
- * He needs her... *

984
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:22,794
The china. Cookies.

985
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:26,873
* No wonder... *

986
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:29,076
That's really wonderful.

987
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:34,195
* So would I *

988
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:38,319
Where are your parents?
Maybe they'd Like some tea.

989
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:42,473
They're in the study
having tea with a guest from Zamosc.

990
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:45,074
Yesterday, two came from Tomashev.

991
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:46,639
I must be going.

992
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:50,599
I may have to leave Bechev
if they don't find someone for me here.

993
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:54,355
They'll find someone.
Who wouldn’t want you? I mean...

994
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:57,716
- Don't you think about marriage?
- No, just my studies.

995
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:00,633
- I admire that in a man.
- That's very good.

996
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:03,672
Good night.

997
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:06,113
Good night.

998
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:22,400
He's not there, Anshel.

999
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:26,757
He's gone. He took his things and Left.

1000
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:32,638
Hurry!

1001
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:35,598
Wagons to Lublin province leaving now!

1002
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:39,150
Wagons to Lublin province
Leaving now!

1003
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:41,674
Avigdor, don't leave! I was wrong!

1004
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:44,593
- You?
- She's worth fighting for!

1005
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:47,274
- Talk to Vishkower.
- He won't listen!

1006
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:51,148
- Maybe there's a Law.
- There are no laws, not for this.

1007
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:56,155
If you stopped studying once in a while,
you'd know more about Life, about Love.

1008
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:00,070
How can I expect you to understand?

1009
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:02,116
You've never felt it.

1010
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:08,148
Last call for Lublin province!

1011
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:10,117
Avigdor!

1012
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:13,310
(Baby crying)

1013
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:15,834
- Oh, my God.
- Carry your suitcase, sir?

1014
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:24,029
Bye, Anshel.

1015
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:26,509
I'm sorry about everything.

1016
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:29,717
Asking what I did was
my only way of staying and it was wrong.

1017
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:33,270
No, it's not wrong. It's understandable.
You're in Love.

1018
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:35,954
- It was sinful, unnatural.
- But what's natural?

1019
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:39,874
- I was asking the impossible.
- Don't go, Avigdor!

1020
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:41,996
Everyone aboard!

1021
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:44,150
Don't go!

1022
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:46,674
I'll come with you!

1023
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:57,594
Wait! Avigdor!

1024
01:11:57,680 --> 01:11:59,910
Nothing's impossible!

1025
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:05,597
Nothing.

1026
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:15,679
It's impossible.

1027
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:19,912
What do you think, Zelig?
I never had such trouble fitting anybody.

1028
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,309
- It's so tight round the chest.
- It fits!

1029
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:24,914
- This is how you cut.
- It's the tape measure.

1030
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,513
It's all right.

1031
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:29,672
For Alter Vishkower's son-in-Law,
we must do our best work.

1032
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:33,196
- I Like it this way.
- He Likes it this way! Ha!

1033
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:37,749
- Look at him.
- * Look at me

1034
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:42,311
* I must be absolutely crazy

1035
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:44,436
* How did I ever let it get this far? *

1036
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:46,158
Take off the coat.

1037
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:48,754
* I’m getting deeper into trouble

1038
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:51,593
* Am I a woman or a man?
Am I a devil or a demon?

1039
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:55,878
Problem with the pants. Next to them,
the coat looks good. Take them off.

1040
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:57,313
- Why?
- Why?

1041
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:59,436
* Papa was right

1042
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:02,751
* I ask too many questions
he said a soul can get perplexed

1043
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:05,354
* I can't believe what happens next
Papa was right! *

1044
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:07,510
- Trouble with the crotch.
- What's wrong?

1045
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:09,909
You’ll find out when you relieve yourself.

1046
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,037
* It seems this little game I play
becomes more risky every day *

1047
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:15,873
- The pants, please.
- All right, I'll take them off.

1048
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:18,918
- Leave the room.
- He's ashamed.

1049
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:22,117
A tailor is Like a doctor.
What's to be ashamed?

1050
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:25,670
Move, Zelig!
The wedding's tomorrow night!

1051
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:29,878
(Tailor) Move!

1052
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:33,316
Tomorrow night? Tomorrow night?

1053
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:39,955
* Tomorrow night, tomorrow night

1054
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:45,478
* Under the canopy I'll stand with her
tomorrow night

1055
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:47,869
* And place a ring upon her hand

1056
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:51,475
* With her all dressed in white

1057
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:53,312
* Tomorrow night

1058
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:56,039
* I don't know how this came about
but I'll be wed without a doubt

1059
01:13:56,120 --> 01:13:59,237
- * I've got to get out! *
- (Tailor) What did you say?

1060
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:01,595
I've got to get out of my clothes.

1061
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:04,274
Get back out here.

1062
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:08,312
- * Look at this... *
- Come on, move.

1063
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:11,517
* The way one lie begets another

1064
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,955
* Somebody wake me up
and say it's all a dream... *

1065
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:16,474
- Ouch!
- Look at this!

1066
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:18,835
* Look how easily I fool them

1067
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:21,718
* They may have eyes but they don't see
they never really look at me

1068
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:23,518
* People are blind

1069
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:26,512
* How else would everyone believe me?

1070
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:29,637
* It might be interesting to know
just how much further I can go... *

1071
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:32,473
Look, the right sieve
is Longer than the Left!

1072
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:34,949
- This will never work.
- We’ll make it work!

1073
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:37,677
At Least the hat fits.

1074
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:42,390
* Tomorrow night, tomorrow night

1075
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:45,472
* I can't believe what I'll presume to be

1076
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:48,154
* Tomorrow night

1077
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:51,232
* I’m not the bride,
but I’m the groom-to-be

1078
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:53,788
* Tomorrow night

1079
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:56,519
* And that's a monumental trick
I'd better think of something quick *

1080
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:58,556
Oh, my God, I'm feeling sick!

1081
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:01,473
Just the usual nerves before the wedding.

1082
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:05,439
- I'd better rest.
- You’ll need plenty of rest!

1083
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:08,193
* I could run away

1084
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:10,316
* I could leave without a trace

1085
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:12,675
* Go anywhere or anyplace

1086
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:17,072
* Where no one knows my face
as a woman or a man

1087
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:21,756
* I don't know, just so I can run away

1088
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:24,593
* Run away

1089
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:26,113
* I’d be free

1090
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:28,998
* I’d be rid of all of this

1091
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:33,312
* But there's someone I would miss

1092
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:38,315
* And being near him is what this

1093
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,994
* Is all about

1094
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:45,475
* So running away is out

1095
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:48,950
(Zelig) Will he get away with it?
(Tailor) Will we get away with it?

1096
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:50,712
* Papa, dear

1097
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:53,872
* You dreamed of dancing at my wedding

1098
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:59,712
* But something tells me that I’m right
you wouldn't want to dance tonight *

1099
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:06,758
Take off the clothes.
All right. We’ll Leave the room.

1100
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:10,071
Come, Zelig, we have a Lot of work to do.

1101
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:13,071
* Isn't this

1102
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:15,435
* A strangely logical solution?

1103
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:20,319
* Things may not be as they appear
but the advantages are clear

1104
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:23,873
* He loves her, she loves him

1105
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:25,473
* He Likes me, I Like her

1106
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:28,233
* And I've reason to think she Likes me

1107
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:31,118
* She keeps him, he keeps her
I keep things as they were

1108
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:33,794
* It's a perfect arrangement for three

1109
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:36,235
* Who'd have ever predicted
the moment would come

1110
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:38,993
* When I’d find myself grateful
they've kept women dumb?

1111
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:41,753
* She's an innocent maiden,
but then, so am I

1112
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:43,990
* That's why it's possible
I could get by

1113
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:46,833
* Look, I’ve seen the impossible
happen before

1114
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:49,309
* Maybe, God willing,
it’ll happen once more

1115
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:51,868
* For I feel like a train on a perilous track

1116
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:53,598
* No way to stop, no way to go back

1117
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:55,557
* A snowball that's gathering speed
down a hill

1118
01:16:55,640 --> 01:16:59,189
* Going faster and faster and faster until

1119
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:04,400
* Tomorrow night, tomorrow night

1120
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:07,472
* Even if someone would pray for me

1121
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:09,710
* Tomorrow night

1122
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:13,232
* There's not a prayer
that they could say for me

1123
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:15,470
* Tomorrow night

1124
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:19,995
* Tomorrow night, tomorrow night,
tomorrow night

1125
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:27,589
* Is now tonight! *

1126
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:29,238
(All cheering)

1127
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:31,959
(All) Mazel tov!
(Man) Blessings!

1128
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:34,918
Success! Mazel tov!

1129
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,877
(Drowned out by chatter)

1130
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:40,475
(Rabbi) Musicians, please!

1131
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:43,552
The mitzvah dance!
The handkerchief dance!

1132
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:52,677
- Excuse me.
- (Rabbi) Where are you going?

1133
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:55,228
(Tailor) Look. Look at the shoulders.

1134
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:00,156
You're not Leaving, are you?

1135
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:02,834
I have a wedding present for both of you.

1136
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:05,514
- Thank you.
- Nachmonides, the holy letter.

1137
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:08,114
He wrote it over 500 years ago.

1138
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:10,998
''Converse with her
to put her mind at ease.

1139
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:16,677
''Speak words which arouse her to Love,
desire, and passion,

1140
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:19,399
''and words of reverence for God. ''

1141
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:23,756
Never force her.

1142
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:26,149
Her mood must be as yours.

1143
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:30,390
Win her with graciousness
and seductiveness.

1144
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:35,314
Be patient until her passion is aroused.

1145
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:38,711
Begin with Love.

1146
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:40,916
And when her mood is ready,

1147
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:44,439
Let her desire be satisfied first.

1148
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:47,874
Her delight is what matters.

1149
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:50,758
(Women talking appreciatively)

1150
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:53,638
- (* Lively music)
- Come along.

1151
01:18:55,720 --> 01:18:59,759
- Avigdor, I... I don't know if I can...
- (Alter) Anshel.

1152
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:02,479
- Anshel.
- Your father-in-law's calling you.

1153
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:05,154
(* Lively music continues)

1154
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:07,629
Anshel, I have to talk to you.

1155
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:11,508
Remember your obligation.
As I said, you mustn't be nervous.

1156
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:18,470
Eve was made from Adam's rib
to obey his wishes. So must you.

1157
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:21,791
- There's nothing to be nervous about.
- Yes, Mother.

1158
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:24,440
We have protected her. She knows nothing.

1159
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:27,796
But I don't have to tell you
to be fruitful and multiply.

1160
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:29,836
Thank you, sir, I know the Law.

1161
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:33,674
May your wedding night
be as joyful as ours... was.

1162
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:38,270
And, please God,
a grandson nine months from now.

1163
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:44,915
(* Lively music)

1164
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:54,913
(Music and laughter downstairs)

1165
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:47,672
Are you too warm?

1166
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:50,118
(Hadass) No.

1167
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:53,155
- Shall I open a window?
- No.

1168
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:56,710
Unless you want to. You're the man.

1169
01:20:58,080 --> 01:20:59,832
That's true.

1170
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:04,550
- Don't be frightened.
- I'm not.

1171
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:06,437
You're not?

1172
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:09,034
- Yes, I am.
- Good.

1173
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:12,112
- What?
- I mean, it's only natural.

1174
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:17,149
You don't have to do
anything you don't want to. Anything.

1175
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:20,232
But I do. I have to do
whatever you demand.

1176
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:23,073
- No, that's not so.
- It's not?

1177
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:26,835
The Talmud says a woman
may refuse her husband.

1178
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:29,878
- My mother said...
- Too many women don't know the Law!

1179
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:33,157
If you want to refuse
then naturally I respect your wishes.

1180
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:37,314
You're a very considerate man, Anshel.

1181
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:41,510
Only because I know
you're thinking of someone else.

1182
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:44,194
Who? I'm not at all, of anyone.

1183
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:46,236
You mustn't be angry with him.

1184
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:47,799
What?

1185
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:51,475
Well, any woman would be
who was close to him.

1186
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:55,471
You're very understanding.

1187
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:59,996
It's only natural that you wish he were here
instead of me.

1188
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:01,752
But you're my husband.

1189
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:06,311
The thing is, Hadass,
because you're still thinking of Avigdor,

1190
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:10,154
I can't Let you commit any unnecessary sin.

1191
01:22:10,240 --> 01:22:11,992
- Sin?
- It's clearly written

1192
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:16,676
that a woman cannot give herself to one
man while she's thinking of another.

1193
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:20,673
Tonight we'll do what you want,
which is nothing, I understand.

1194
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:23,832
- I don't know what I want.
- When you do,

1195
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:26,070
you must Let me know.

1196
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:30,472
You're very hard to resist, Hadass,

1197
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:33,836
but I'm not going to force myself on you.

1198
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:37,390
I'll... I'll just have to be patient.

1199
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:42,319
- Good.
- Good.

1200
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:49,275
Ah! A drop more wine?

1201
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:51,555
(Yentl chuckles)

1202
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:54,518
It's our secret. No one needs to know.

1203
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:56,318
Our secret.

1204
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:59,876
And our friendship.

1205
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:03,191
- A husband and wife can be friends?
- Oh, yes.

1206
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:07,068
There's only one problem. Help me.

1207
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:10,118
In the morning, when they come in,
they'll think we've...

1208
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:12,395
- But we haven't!
- Shh! Secret!

1209
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:14,550
- Shh!
- (Both giggling)

1210
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,950
Wait, no, just one bed.

1211
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:24,713
(Giggling)

1212
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:29,596
- You silly goose!
- (Laughter)

1213
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:36,668
(Laughter continues)

1214
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:46,239
- (Crash)
- Ooh!

1215
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:49,676
You tell me.

1216
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:54,196
Truce, truce!

1217
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:56,236
(Both Laughing)

1218
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:58,515
(Hadass) Oh!

1219
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:09,596
(Hadass sighs)

1220
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:12,518
Anshel.

1221
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:18,677
I think I'm going to Like
being married to you.

1222
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:26,155
Good night, Hadass.

1223
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:28,196
Good night.

1224
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:31,759
(Burp)

1225
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:33,796
(Laughter)

1226
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:39,592
(Avigdor) So, er... what was it Like?

1227
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:42,638
- Oh, the usual. Music, dancing...
- I was there.

1228
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:44,472
Oh.

1229
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:47,199
Hadass and I talked, laughed a little...

1230
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:48,838
Laughed a Lot.

1231
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:50,797
And then she went to sleep.

1232
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:52,836
Tell me the truth.

1233
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:55,070
People who want the truth never believe it.

1234
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:58,232
- What did you do to her?
- What do you think I did to her?

1235
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:00,914
You kissed her, caressed her, held her.

1236
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:05,710
All right! I did everything Like you said.
What else do you want to know?

1237
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:07,756
Did she make sounds? Did she scream... ?

1238
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:11,674
- She screamed and went to sleep.
- Went to sleep?

1239
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:13,910
- Anshel.
- She talked a Little.

1240
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:17,037
Talked? In her sleep? What did she say?

1241
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:19,156
Things Like, ''Avigdor, I Love you. ''

1242
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:21,196
''I Love you''?

1243
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:24,113
Go on.

1244
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:30,349
''I adore you, Avigdor, '' she said.

1245
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:34,633
That's the truth?

1246
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:37,717
Yes, my friend.

1247
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:40,716
That's the truth.

1248
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:03,598
Raspberry tea
is very good for headaches.

1249
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:09,909
- Thank you.
- Am I disturbing you?

1250
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,558
No.

1251
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:18,149
It's almost sundown, the Sabbath.

1252
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:21,117
Yes.

1253
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:26,318
Mother says it's a special blessing
on the Sabbath.

1254
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:29,437
- Going to synagogue?
- Going to bed.

1255
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:32,399
Mm.

1256
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:34,948
- Unless you're tired.
- What?

1257
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:40,034
Drink your tea. It's getting cold.

1258
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:49,278
When Avigdor used to call,
I sometimes spilled things.

1259
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:52,318
- I don't know if you ever noticed.
- No, never.

1260
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:56,632
It's because he made me tremble, inside.

1261
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:00,470
That's Love, Hadass.

1262
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:02,710
But you don't make me tremble.

1263
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:07,916
You make me peaceful.

1264
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:13,910
That's the friendship
I was telling you about.

1265
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,912
- In the Talmud...
- So will you teach me?

1266
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:20,716
Teach you?

1267
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:23,393
Please?

1268
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:27,873
- Talmud?
- Talmud?

1269
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:30,520
- Talmud!
- Not the Talmud.

1270
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:35,754
Talmud! It's the Least a husband can do
for his wife, the most maybe.

1271
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:37,796
I could never Learn Talmud.

1272
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:39,996
Nonsense! Lock the door.

1273
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:43,038
- Isn't it a sin?
- It's not a sin.

1274
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:46,476
Then why are we closing the curtains
and locking the door?

1275
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:50,473
God will understand.
I'm not so sure about the neighbors.

1276
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:52,516
- (Laughs)
- What's funny?

1277
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:54,716
You. I've never seen you so excited.

1278
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:58,270
Now pay attention, Hadass.
First there's the Bible,

1279
01:27:58,360 --> 01:28:00,999
- the five books of Moses...
- Wait.

1280
01:28:01,080 --> 01:28:04,311
- Where are you going?
- The soup's on the stove...

1281
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:07,198
Let your mother do it, please!

1282
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:10,511
The Talmud is commentaries
interpreting the...

1283
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:13,478
- What are you doing?
- Just pulling a thread...

1284
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:15,755
- Don't! We're studying!
- Yes, Anshel.

1285
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:18,832
- Where was I?
- Commentaries interpreting the Bible.

1286
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:21,797
Yes.

1287
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:25,236
The first commentary is the Mishna,
our code of Law.

1288
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:27,550
I'm glad your headache's better.

1289
01:28:29,320 --> 01:28:33,711
It's a masterpiece of literature, folklore,
and philosophy,

1290
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:36,268
it deals with astronomy,
architecture, medicine.

1291
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:39,318
Everything from making Love
to planting Egyptian beans.

1292
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:41,868
Making Love?

1293
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:44,155
To planting Egyptian beans.

1294
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:46,913
I thought you said something about
making Love.

1295
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:51,710
Then there's the midrash -
legends, stories, dealing with legal issues.

1296
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:55,679
Two men dispute
the ownership of a flock of chickens...

1297
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:58,194
While your books argue about chickens,

1298
01:28:58,280 --> 01:29:00,555
I've had to pluck them.

1299
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:03,393
It's Friday. I've been up since dawn.

1300
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:08,349
I'm too tired to be
a scholar on Fridays, Anshel.

1301
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:10,396
I'm sorry.

1302
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:13,756
I'm the one who's sorry, Hadass.

1303
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:18,913
I'm too tired
for the special Sabbath blessing,

1304
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:23,994
even if maybe you were
going to... demand it...

1305
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:25,433
Maybe.

1306
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:29,795
(Quiet snoring)

1307
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:31,916
(Bell tolling)

1308
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:39,032
(Lively chatter)

1309
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:43,990
Next Tuesday, eight o’clock.

1310
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:47,516
What about her parents?

1311
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:50,433
I'll just say, ''Avigdor's coming to dinner. ''

1312
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:52,556
Anyway, they're away next Tuesday.

1313
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:54,995
Are you two agreeing or disagreeing?

1314
01:29:55,080 --> 01:29:56,513
- Agreeing.
- Disagreeing.

1315
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:57,999
- Disagreeing.
- Agreeing.

1316
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:03,352
- (Hadass) He's one second late.
- Hm?

1317
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:06,556
Oh... yes.

1318
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:09,156
(Doorbell)

1319
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:14,554
- Hello, Sophie.
- I'll take your hat.

1320
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:22,311
(Yentl) Thank you, Sophie.

1321
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:25,232
Hello.

1322
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:34,712
This is the one I brought from home.

1323
01:30:36,040 --> 01:30:38,395
The first part's about the ancient mystics.

1324
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:40,675
It's all a bit elementary, but...

1325
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:47,277
Welcome, Avigdor.

1326
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:49,430
(Yentl and Hadass Laughing)

1327
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:52,432
- (Hadass) Tell me more.
- I've told you everything.

1328
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:55,193
(Hadass) It was a very interesting
discussion.

1329
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:57,396
And then what happened?

1330
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:01,472
Well, erm... Avigdor was there too.
He'll tell you.

1331
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:05,194
Was Rabbi Zalman angry or did he laugh?

1332
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:08,238
He... he laughed. Didn't he, Avigdor?

1333
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:10,436
- Yes.
- Did you laugh?

1334
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:14,197
We both did.

1335
01:31:14,280 --> 01:31:16,236
I can just see you.

1336
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:27,793
- I'll do that.
- No.

1337
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:29,836
But you have a guest.

1338
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:31,876
So have you.

1339
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:44,279
(Avigdor) Marriage agrees with you.

1340
01:31:44,360 --> 01:31:47,750
- You're more beautiful than ever.
- Thank you.

1341
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:50,877
Avigdor, I'm concerned about Anshel.

1342
01:31:52,040 --> 01:31:55,635
- What are you talking about?
- I don't think Anshel is happy.

1343
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:02,348
Why don't we have tea in the parlor?

1344
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,753
Milk or, er... Lemon?

1345
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,399
Fine.

1346
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:14,476
(Hadass) Ah!

1347
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:20,272
Sorry.

1348
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:24,118
(* Hadass humming melody)

1349
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:30,594
We Left off with Maimonides' code
of the golden rule.

1350
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:33,240
(Humming)

1351
01:32:35,560 --> 01:32:40,270
Let's read chapters seven and eight
and then discuss them. Is that all right?

1352
01:32:40,360 --> 01:32:42,635
- All right.
- (Stops humming)

1353
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:46,234
Don't stop, Hadass. It's pretty.

1354
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:51,357
(Humming)

1355
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:02,989
* Look at how he looks at her

1356
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:11,397
* Will someone ever look at me that way?

1357
01:33:12,360 --> 01:33:14,430
* Full of all the feelings

1358
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:22,916
* And the soft unspoken words
that lovers say

1359
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:26,716
* I thought that I knew every single look

1360
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:30,349
* And sweet expression on his face

1361
01:33:30,440 --> 01:33:34,956
* Yet this is one that I don't recognize

1362
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:40,592
* Although I’ve sat
and studied him for hours

1363
01:33:40,680 --> 01:33:46,710
* But now I see how love
completely occupies

1364
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:49,633
* A pair of eyes

1365
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:52,868
* See the way they gaze at her

1366
01:33:52,960 --> 01:34:01,789
* Like slaves they follow
everywhere she goes

1367
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:04,314
* Do my eyes forget themselves

1368
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:07,198
* And do I ever look at him

1369
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:09,475
* And smile in such a way

1370
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:13,235
* That what I’m feeling shows?

1371
01:34:13,320 --> 01:34:15,959
* Sometimes I have the feeling

1372
01:34:16,040 --> 01:34:19,476
* Everybody knows

1373
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:22,313
* And even though it's crazy

1374
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:29,909
* Still I can't help wondering
if I'll ever live to see that day

1375
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:33,675
* When by some

1376
01:34:34,280 --> 01:34:37,078
* Miracle of miracles

1377
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:43,793
* He'll turn around and look at me

1378
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:49,153
* That way... *

1379
01:34:49,240 --> 01:34:53,233
It's no good. I'm sorry. Excuse me.

1380
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:54,912
Avigdor.

1381
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,592
Avigdor, wait!

1382
01:34:56,680 --> 01:34:58,432
(Avigdor) Good night.

1383
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:09,473
Anshel.

1384
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:11,118
(Yentl) Hm?

1385
01:35:11,680 --> 01:35:13,636
How many children do you want?

1386
01:35:16,840 --> 01:35:21,789
The actual number?
I don't think I've ever really...

1387
01:35:21,880 --> 01:35:24,633
He didn't make me tremble tonight.

1388
01:35:24,720 --> 01:35:26,711
(Yentl) Hm?

1389
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:28,552
You did, though.

1390
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:33,631
What's even nicer, I made you tremble.

1391
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:35,278
What?

1392
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:38,670
When he was Leaving,
I put my hand on yours.

1393
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:40,512
You were trembling.

1394
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:44,036
Er, well... What are you doing, Hadass?

1395
01:35:44,120 --> 01:35:47,396
- I'm Looking at you.
- I can't read without my glasses.

1396
01:35:47,480 --> 01:35:50,358
When you told me I could refuse you,

1397
01:35:50,440 --> 01:35:53,796
you didn't tell me I also could demand you.

1398
01:35:53,880 --> 01:35:55,836
Who told you that?

1399
01:35:55,920 --> 01:35:59,629
The Talmud. I forget what page.

1400
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:02,359
- 63a and b.
- It's written, Anshel.

1401
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:05,034
You've been studying too hard.

1402
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:08,590
You said to tell you
when I knew what I wanted.

1403
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:10,636
I do.

1404
01:36:10,720 --> 01:36:13,109
It isn't Avigdor. It's no Longer a sin.

1405
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:15,475
- H-Hadass, I...
- Shh.

1406
01:36:16,440 --> 01:36:20,479
It's been terrible for you, I know,
all this waiting.

1407
01:36:22,040 --> 01:36:24,315
But it's all right now.

1408
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:26,960
You don't have to wait any Longer.

1409
01:36:28,360 --> 01:36:31,750
Oh, God! Oh, God! I'm so sorry.

1410
01:36:32,840 --> 01:36:35,559
- I'm so sorry, Hadass.
- For what?

1411
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:38,677
For teaching me? For understanding me?

1412
01:36:38,760 --> 01:36:41,035
For making me fall in Love with you?

1413
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:44,196
I can't! I can't!

1414
01:36:46,440 --> 01:36:48,954
I feel so certain that you Love me.

1415
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:53,038
Everything you do
shows me you Love me.

1416
01:36:53,120 --> 01:36:55,156
What is it, Anshel?

1417
01:36:55,240 --> 01:36:58,198
* Look at how she looks at me

1418
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:04,238
* But I can never look at her that way... *

1419
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:06,709
Is it me? Am I so... ?

1420
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:10,791
- Do you find me... ?
- I find you beautiful, beautiful.

1421
01:37:12,360 --> 01:37:14,510
Then what?

1422
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:16,192
* Full of all the feelings

1423
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:21,673
* And the soft unspoken words
that lovers say... *

1424
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:24,672
There are things I wish I could explain,

1425
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:27,115
things I'd Like to tell you.

1426
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:29,752
I feel so...

1427
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:33,674
- Maybe you’ll feel better tomorrow.
- I hope so.

1428
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:35,716
* In all the words in all the books

1429
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:38,758
* I wish there were a way to say

1430
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:43,277
* What she's taught me
isn't written anywhere

1431
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:48,115
* And I’m supposed to be
the one who's wise

1432
01:37:48,920 --> 01:37:50,512
* One thing is certain

1433
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:53,876
* I can never be what she

1434
01:37:55,080 --> 01:37:59,039
* Expects of me

1435
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:13,149
* I've wanted the shadows

1436
01:38:13,240 --> 01:38:16,596
* I don't any more

1437
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:21,839
* No matter what happens

1438
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:26,311
* I won't any more

1439
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:30,154
* I've run from the sunlight

1440
01:38:30,240 --> 01:38:33,277
* Afraid it saw too much

1441
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:37,558
* The moon had the one Light

1442
01:38:37,640 --> 01:38:40,029
* I bathed in

1443
01:38:40,120 --> 01:38:42,111
* I waked in

1444
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:48,230
* I held in my feelings

1445
01:38:48,320 --> 01:38:51,232
* And closed every door

1446
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:55,715
* No matter what happens

1447
01:38:55,800 --> 01:38:59,873
* I can't any more

1448
01:38:59,960 --> 01:39:03,919
* There's someone who must hear

1449
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:07,913
* The words I've never spoken

1450
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:11,629
* Tonight if he were here

1451
01:39:11,720 --> 01:39:15,838
* My silence would be broken

1452
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:19,549
* I need him to touch me

1453
01:39:19,640 --> 01:39:22,552
* To know the Love that's in my heart

1454
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:26,394
* The same heart that tells me

1455
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:28,550
* To see myself

1456
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:30,870
* To free myself

1457
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:36,273
* To be myself at Last

1458
01:39:36,360 --> 01:39:41,195
* For too many mornings

1459
01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:44,829
* The curtains were drawn

1460
01:39:44,920 --> 01:39:48,196
* It's time they were opened

1461
01:39:48,280 --> 01:39:51,477
* To welcome the dawn

1462
01:39:51,560 --> 01:39:55,758
* A voice deep inside's getting stronger

1463
01:39:55,840 --> 01:40:00,277
* I can't keep it quiet any Longer

1464
01:40:00,360 --> 01:40:05,036
* No matter what happens

1465
01:40:05,120 --> 01:40:13,391
* It can't be the same any more

1466
01:40:22,360 --> 01:40:24,316
* I promise

1467
01:40:25,400 --> 01:40:27,630
* It won't be

1468
01:40:28,720 --> 01:40:32,076
* The same

1469
01:40:33,280 --> 01:40:39,116
* Any more *

1470
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:05,078
I'll miss you.

1471
01:41:05,160 --> 01:41:07,515
You’ll have lots to do while I'm gone.

1472
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:10,558
- I know, but...
- Tell your parents I'm sorry.

1473
01:41:10,640 --> 01:41:12,198
Sorry?

1474
01:41:12,280 --> 01:41:14,635
That I wasn't here when they got home.

1475
01:41:14,720 --> 01:41:16,676
You’ll see them on Friday.

1476
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:18,876
You can tell us about the city.

1477
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:21,076
Show them the books you bought.

1478
01:41:23,480 --> 01:41:25,038
Oh...

1479
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:27,076
I baked almond cakes.

1480
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:31,276
You and Avigdor wouldn’t Last three days
without my almond cakes.

1481
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:32,918
Thank you.

1482
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:38,836
Hurry home.

1483
01:41:38,920 --> 01:41:41,718
It won't be the same here without you.

1484
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:43,677
Hadass.

1485
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:46,638
Do you remember
what we studied Last week

1486
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:48,790
in the Talmud about patience?

1487
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:51,348
Tell me, what did we read?

1488
01:41:51,440 --> 01:41:54,193
''Patience yields many good things. ''

1489
01:41:54,280 --> 01:41:57,636
If you have patience,
you’ll have everything you want.

1490
01:41:57,720 --> 01:42:00,553
Children, beautiful children,
as many as you want.

1491
01:42:01,640 --> 01:42:03,596
Trust me.

1492
01:42:04,840 --> 01:42:06,796
I do trust you.

1493
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:14,557
Well, I... have to be going.

1494
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:22,916
I'll study while you're away.

1495
01:42:23,640 --> 01:42:25,596
I want you to be proud of me.

1496
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:29,270
Oh, I am proud of you.

1497
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:31,590
You should be proud of yourself.

1498
01:42:34,440 --> 01:42:36,192
I Love you, Anshel.

1499
01:42:38,640 --> 01:42:40,596
I Love you too.

1500
01:42:50,440 --> 01:42:53,034
* She's mother

1501
01:42:53,120 --> 01:42:55,270
* She's sister

1502
01:42:55,360 --> 01:42:58,511
* She's lover

1503
01:42:58,600 --> 01:43:04,391
* She's the wonder of wonders

1504
01:43:04,480 --> 01:43:09,031
* No man can deny

1505
01:43:09,120 --> 01:43:13,989
* So why would he change her?

1506
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:18,392
* She's loving, she's tender

1507
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:23,349
* She's woman

1508
01:43:25,120 --> 01:43:31,639
* So am I *

1509
01:43:38,200 --> 01:43:40,350
This trip was a good idea, Anshel.

1510
01:43:40,440 --> 01:43:42,954
- I have a secret to tell you.
- Tell me.

1511
01:43:43,040 --> 01:43:45,793
- Not now.
- All right.

1512
01:43:45,880 --> 01:43:49,714
(Avigdor chuckles) So my crazy plan
was crazy after all.

1513
01:43:50,720 --> 01:43:52,073
What?

1514
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:54,116
She Loves you now.

1515
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:56,873
- She only thinks she does.
- What?

1516
01:43:58,120 --> 01:44:00,918
Things aren't always what they seem.

1517
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:02,956
What are you talking about?

1518
01:44:03,040 --> 01:44:04,996
You’ll see.

1519
01:44:07,240 --> 01:44:09,595
Now, what's this secret of yours?

1520
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:14,355
I'll tell you when we get to Lublin.

1521
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:20,559
(Avigdor) Look, there's our friend again.

1522
01:44:20,640 --> 01:44:23,154
(Yentl) I wonder if it ever gets tired?

1523
01:44:36,280 --> 01:44:39,238
- When are you going to tell me?
- Not yet.

1524
01:44:39,320 --> 01:44:41,709
- Why not?
- I just can't.

1525
01:45:46,440 --> 01:45:48,351
Slivovitz?

1526
01:45:48,440 --> 01:45:50,192
No, thanks.

1527
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:53,475
So let's hear the secret of yours.

1528
01:45:56,440 --> 01:45:58,590
Maybe I will have a glass.

1529
01:45:58,680 --> 01:46:01,035
Good. You look a little pale.

1530
01:46:05,120 --> 01:46:07,076
- Lechaim.
- Lechaim.

1531
01:46:15,560 --> 01:46:17,516
So tell me.

1532
01:46:22,440 --> 01:46:24,271
Well, er...

1533
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:28,914
We're friends. What can't you tell me?

1534
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:33,558
All right.

1535
01:46:36,400 --> 01:46:39,358
Avigdor, what would you do

1536
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:43,319
if all you wanted in Life was to study
and it was forbidden?

1537
01:46:43,400 --> 01:46:45,960
- It isn't forbidden.
- What if it were?

1538
01:46:46,040 --> 01:46:50,272
What would you do if some crazy Law
said all men called Avigdor

1539
01:46:50,360 --> 01:46:53,272
or all men with brown eyes
were forbidden to study?

1540
01:46:53,360 --> 01:46:55,237
- I'd study anyway.
- Secretly?

1541
01:46:55,320 --> 01:46:57,072
If I had to. Why?

1542
01:46:57,160 --> 01:47:00,516
And that would be difficult,
always hiding, afraid?

1543
01:47:00,600 --> 01:47:02,591
Yes. What's your secret?

1544
01:47:02,680 --> 01:47:05,478
Without studying, you couldn’t Live.
Is that right?

1545
01:47:05,560 --> 01:47:08,233
- That's right.
- I couldn’t, either.

1546
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:12,632
- So?
- So I studied, secretly.

1547
01:47:12,720 --> 01:47:16,190
No, you didn't.
What are you babbling about?

1548
01:47:18,680 --> 01:47:20,432
Avigdor...

1549
01:47:21,800 --> 01:47:23,756
my name isn't Anshel.

1550
01:47:24,640 --> 01:47:26,835
That's your secret?

1551
01:47:28,680 --> 01:47:30,671
Dear Avigdor.

1552
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:35,708
- I don't know how to tell you this.
- Well, don't. I'll guess.

1553
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:39,315
- I'm not a yeshiva boy.
- You're the chief rabbi of Lithuania.

1554
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:44,598
- I'm not any kind of boy.
- Not the chief rabbi, all right.

1555
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:47,752
My name isn't Anshel.

1556
01:47:48,600 --> 01:47:50,397
It's... it's Yentl.

1557
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:51,833
Yentl?

1558
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:55,431
And...

1559
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:00,996
I'm a woman.

1560
01:48:02,040 --> 01:48:03,792
A woman.

1561
01:48:04,760 --> 01:48:06,716
A woman.

1562
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:09,476
Now my secret.

1563
01:48:10,360 --> 01:48:13,158
- I'm the Tsar of Russia.
- Then I'll prove it.

1564
01:48:13,240 --> 01:48:17,119
- Stop this, Anshel.
- I'm not Anshel. I'm Yentl.

1565
01:48:19,520 --> 01:48:23,752
- I'm not a man. I'm a woman.
- Stop it.

1566
01:48:24,640 --> 01:48:27,871
- I'm a woman, Avigdor.
- Anshel, I don't Like this.

1567
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:29,916
What kind of a game is this?

1568
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:31,956
It's not a game.

1569
01:48:33,400 --> 01:48:35,356
Not any more.

1570
01:48:38,720 --> 01:48:40,995
What are you doing?

1571
01:48:45,920 --> 01:48:47,876
What are you doing?

1572
01:48:48,360 --> 01:48:50,430
(Avigdor sighs)

1573
01:48:58,360 --> 01:49:00,316
Oh, my God.

1574
01:49:01,320 --> 01:49:04,437
I've only shown you
so you can testify to the rabbis.

1575
01:49:04,520 --> 01:49:06,272
It can't be.

1576
01:49:06,360 --> 01:49:08,316
It is.

1577
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:11,716
What have you done?

1578
01:49:12,640 --> 01:49:14,995
- Listen to me.
- Don't come near me.

1579
01:49:15,080 --> 01:49:17,640
- Let me explain.
- Don't touch me.

1580
01:49:17,720 --> 01:49:20,871
Avigdor, don't be afraid,
I'm not going to hurt you.

1581
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:22,916
- You're a monster.
- No.

1582
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:24,956
All I ever wanted to do was study.

1583
01:49:25,040 --> 01:49:28,396
''A woman shall not wear
that which pertained to a man. ''

1584
01:49:28,480 --> 01:49:30,596
- You're a devil.
- Try to understand...

1585
01:49:30,680 --> 01:49:33,069
- Enough! Please!
- I'm not a devil.

1586
01:49:33,160 --> 01:49:35,628
Every commandment broken, every day!

1587
01:49:35,720 --> 01:49:39,793
Stay away from me! Please!
What are you, a demon?

1588
01:49:39,880 --> 01:49:41,996
- I'm not.
- You spit on the Torah!

1589
01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:43,877
I Love the Torah!

1590
01:49:43,960 --> 01:49:47,032
You spit on it, on everything and everyone.

1591
01:49:47,120 --> 01:49:50,078
In God's face, my face, Hadass's face!

1592
01:49:50,160 --> 01:49:52,390
- God, Hadass!
- She knows nothing!

1593
01:49:52,480 --> 01:49:54,596
- Nothing?
- No, she's never...

1594
01:49:54,680 --> 01:49:57,911
An innocent married to a devil!
You married a woman!

1595
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,275
- How could you do that?
- It was your idea!

1596
01:50:00,360 --> 01:50:02,635
- This? My doing?
- Yes!

1597
01:50:02,720 --> 01:50:07,874
Come on, you're a man. Answer me
Like a man. I want to know why. Why?

1598
01:50:07,960 --> 01:50:09,712
Why didn't you say you were a woman?

1599
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:12,234
I was afraid of this, of exactly this!

1600
01:50:12,320 --> 01:50:15,232
So you lied to me, you lied to Hadass!

1601
01:50:15,320 --> 01:50:17,550
I told you things I wouldn’t tell a wife!

1602
01:50:17,640 --> 01:50:19,790
- I'm glad you told me.
- What kind of creature are you?

1603
01:50:19,880 --> 01:50:22,314
- Just a woman.
- I want the answer.

1604
01:50:22,400 --> 01:50:24,960
Tell me the answer. Why? Why?

1605
01:50:25,040 --> 01:50:27,508
- I... I was afraid.
- Why?

1606
01:50:27,600 --> 01:50:29,716
- I wanted to be near you.
- Why?

1607
01:50:29,800 --> 01:50:32,030
I didn't wanna Lose you. I Loved you.

1608
01:50:32,120 --> 01:50:34,873
(Sobbing)

1609
01:50:42,160 --> 01:50:44,469
(Avigdor) Oh, God.

1610
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:47,393
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

1611
01:50:47,480 --> 01:50:49,436
(Sobbing) I Loved you.

1612
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:03,872
I thought you didn't
understand about Love.

1613
01:51:06,200 --> 01:51:08,156
No wonder.

1614
01:51:09,120 --> 01:51:11,076
My God, no wonder.

1615
01:51:12,760 --> 01:51:16,753
All the times I looked at you and touched
you and I couldn’t understand why.

1616
01:51:16,840 --> 01:51:18,990
I thought something was wrong with me.

1617
01:51:19,080 --> 01:51:21,275
There was nothing wrong with you.

1618
01:51:21,360 --> 01:51:23,316
It was me.

1619
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:36,516
Your skin.

1620
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:39,272
It's so...

1621
01:51:41,440 --> 01:51:43,032
Your hair...

1622
01:51:43,120 --> 01:51:45,315
It must have been beautiful.

1623
01:51:46,160 --> 01:51:47,912
It’ll grow.

1624
01:51:49,200 --> 01:51:51,156
Your hands...

1625
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:53,956
I always tried to hide them.

1626
01:51:54,040 --> 01:51:55,792
Oh, no.

1627
01:52:00,920 --> 01:52:02,876
I did... I...

1628
01:52:06,280 --> 01:52:08,236
I didn't want to touch you.

1629
01:52:11,240 --> 01:52:12,798
I was afraid to.

1630
01:52:20,120 --> 01:52:21,951
Your mouth...

1631
01:52:28,240 --> 01:52:29,992
Yentl.

1632
01:52:32,680 --> 01:52:34,636
I Loved you too.

1633
01:53:00,360 --> 01:53:02,112
Hadass.

1634
01:53:12,360 --> 01:53:14,316
It's not...

1635
01:53:15,800 --> 01:53:17,552
difficult.

1636
01:53:18,920 --> 01:53:21,275
I'll write a statement to the rabbis

1637
01:53:22,840 --> 01:53:25,513
that the marriage was never consummated.

1638
01:53:25,600 --> 01:53:29,149
You can take it back to Beshev,
give it to the rabbis.

1639
01:53:29,240 --> 01:53:31,196
The rabbis witnessed it.

1640
01:53:31,280 --> 01:53:35,751
Witnessed what, a marriage between
two women? It's null and void.

1641
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:38,195
According to divorce procedures...

1642
01:53:38,280 --> 01:53:42,592
No, according to God,
it was not a marriage.

1643
01:53:42,680 --> 01:53:45,831
This is crazy.
I'm arguing Talmud with a woman.

1644
01:53:51,560 --> 01:53:53,516
It's not the first time.

1645
01:54:04,680 --> 01:54:06,636
Go back to her, Avigdor.

1646
01:54:09,920 --> 01:54:13,799
I don't think Hadass will Listen
to her parents any more.

1647
01:54:13,880 --> 01:54:18,431
Maybe there's something we can do,
a Law or something...

1648
01:54:18,520 --> 01:54:20,875
Avigdor, there's no book with this in it.

1649
01:54:22,840 --> 01:54:26,469
Sometimes... right can come from wrong,

1650
01:54:27,840 --> 01:54:29,592
virtue from sin.

1651
01:54:29,680 --> 01:54:31,989
It's in the Talmud somewhere.

1652
01:54:33,480 --> 01:54:35,232
We’ll go to another town.

1653
01:54:35,320 --> 01:54:37,834
We’ll get married, have children.

1654
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:39,990
We’ll find a new yeshiva.

1655
01:54:40,080 --> 01:54:41,718
For both of us?

1656
01:54:42,680 --> 01:54:44,636
You still want to study?

1657
01:54:45,680 --> 01:54:49,992
We've argued the Bible back to Genesis,
chapter one, verse one.

1658
01:54:50,080 --> 01:54:52,150
How could you still ask me that question?

1659
01:54:52,240 --> 01:54:54,629
You don't need to any more.

1660
01:54:54,720 --> 01:54:57,109
I'll do the thinking, I'll handle everything.

1661
01:54:57,200 --> 01:54:59,873
I want to study with you, not darn socks.

1662
01:54:59,960 --> 01:55:02,599
- Impossible.
- Nothing's impossible.

1663
01:55:02,680 --> 01:55:05,638
You can study at home.
No one has to know.

1664
01:55:05,720 --> 01:55:08,996
And draw the curtains,
close the shutters?

1665
01:55:09,080 --> 01:55:11,958
- I want you to be a real woman.
- I am.

1666
01:55:12,040 --> 01:55:13,792
Then act Like one!

1667
01:55:13,880 --> 01:55:17,350
There's no gift from God
more beautiful and miraculous.

1668
01:55:17,440 --> 01:55:20,318
You know everything
without opening books.

1669
01:55:20,400 --> 01:55:22,356
What more do you want?

1670
01:55:26,400 --> 01:55:27,992
More.

1671
01:56:02,840 --> 01:56:05,479
Your beard.

1672
01:56:05,560 --> 01:56:08,199
I suppose it’ll never grow in now.

1673
01:56:13,240 --> 01:56:15,196
How could I have been so blind?

1674
01:56:18,120 --> 01:56:20,759
Here's a statement for the rabbi

1675
01:56:20,840 --> 01:56:22,796
and a note for Hadass.

1676
01:56:23,440 --> 01:56:25,908
Would you give it to her for me, please?

1677
01:56:26,840 --> 01:56:28,592
I'll miss you.

1678
01:56:29,680 --> 01:56:31,875
I'll miss you too, Avigdor.

1679
01:56:55,160 --> 01:56:57,196
Goodbye, Anshel.

1680
01:56:58,520 --> 01:57:00,556
Yentl.

1681
01:57:04,120 --> 01:57:05,473
Yentl.

1682
01:57:16,040 --> 01:57:17,996
* There are moments

1683
01:57:19,240 --> 01:57:22,038
* You remember all your Life

1684
01:57:22,920 --> 01:57:25,832
* There are moments you know

1685
01:57:25,920 --> 01:57:29,879
* Will be with you all your Life

1686
01:57:31,360 --> 01:57:34,238
* His face

1687
01:57:34,320 --> 01:57:39,348
* Will be written on my mind

1688
01:57:40,440 --> 01:57:46,390
* Will be written in my heart

1689
01:57:48,160 --> 01:57:55,032
* As Long as I Live *

1690
01:57:56,160 --> 01:57:58,390
My dear Avigdor.

1691
01:57:58,480 --> 01:58:01,756
After many months,
your letter finally reached me.

1692
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:03,796
I hope this one finds you!

1693
01:58:03,880 --> 01:58:05,791
Since we said goodbye,

1694
01:58:05,880 --> 01:58:09,395
I’ve prayed that,
despite the pain I’ve caused,

1695
01:58:09,480 --> 01:58:12,153
some happiness would come out of it.

1696
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,230
And now you tell me it has.

1697
01:58:15,320 --> 01:58:18,437
As for me, I’m going to a new place

1698
01:58:18,520 --> 01:58:21,080
where I hear things are different.

1699
01:58:21,160 --> 01:58:23,469
Anyway, we'll see.

1700
01:58:23,560 --> 01:58:26,313
Take care of yourself, and Hadass.

1701
01:58:26,400 --> 01:58:29,073
l hope she continues with her studies.

1702
01:58:29,160 --> 01:58:31,435
She has great promise.

1703
01:58:31,520 --> 01:58:35,399
And remember,
l will love you both, always.

1704
01:58:37,080 --> 01:58:42,837
* Tell me where

1705
01:58:44,440 --> 01:58:49,468
* Where is it written
what it is I’m meant to be?

1706
01:58:58,520 --> 01:59:01,671
* That I can't dare?

1707
01:59:08,280 --> 01:59:11,955
* It all began

1708
01:59:13,600 --> 01:59:16,319
* The day I found

1709
01:59:17,480 --> 01:59:24,716
* That from my window
I could only see a piece of sky

1710
01:59:24,800 --> 01:59:27,678
* I stepped outside

1711
01:59:28,400 --> 01:59:31,517
* And looked around

1712
01:59:32,320 --> 01:59:36,233
* I never dreamed it was so wide

1713
01:59:36,840 --> 01:59:39,752
* Or even half as high

1714
01:59:39,840 --> 01:59:42,149
* The time had come

1715
01:59:42,240 --> 01:59:44,196
* Papa, can you hear me?

1716
01:59:44,280 --> 01:59:45,759
* To try my wings

1717
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:48,070
* Papa, are you near me?

1718
01:59:48,160 --> 01:59:52,631
* And even though
it seemed at any moment

1719
01:59:52,720 --> 01:59:54,597
* I could fall

1720
01:59:54,680 --> 01:59:57,035
* I felt the most...

1721
01:59:57,120 --> 01:59:59,190
* Papa, can you see me?

1722
01:59:59,280 --> 02:00:02,716
*. . amazing things
Can you understand me?

1723
02:00:02,800 --> 02:00:05,758
* The things you can't imagine

1724
02:00:05,840 --> 02:00:09,310
* If you've never flown at all

1725
02:00:09,400 --> 02:00:13,188
* Though it's safer to stay on the ground

1726
02:00:13,280 --> 02:00:16,352
* Sometimes where danger Lies

1727
02:00:16,440 --> 02:00:20,353
* There the sweetest of pleasures
are found

1728
02:00:20,440 --> 02:00:23,637
* No matter where I go

1729
02:00:23,720 --> 02:00:28,350
* There'll be memories
that tug at my sieve

1730
02:00:28,440 --> 02:00:31,671
* But there will also be

1731
02:00:31,760 --> 02:00:36,072
* More to question, yet more to believe

1732
02:00:36,160 --> 02:00:41,029
* Oh, tell me where

1733
02:00:41,120 --> 02:00:46,069
* Where is the someone
who will turn to look at me?

1734
02:00:46,160 --> 02:00:50,233
* And want to share

1735
02:00:50,320 --> 02:00:56,156
* My every sweet imagined possibility?

1736
02:00:58,160 --> 02:01:01,391
* The more I live

1737
02:01:02,640 --> 02:01:06,155
* The more I Learn

1738
02:01:06,240 --> 02:01:10,836
* The more I Learn, the more I realize

1739
02:01:10,920 --> 02:01:13,514
* The less I know

1740
02:01:13,600 --> 02:01:15,477
* Each step I take

1741
02:01:15,560 --> 02:01:17,312
* Papa, I've a voice now

1742
02:01:17,400 --> 02:01:18,958
* Each page I turn

1743
02:01:19,040 --> 02:01:20,996
* Papa, I've a choice now

1744
02:01:21,080 --> 02:01:24,038
* Each mile I travel only means

1745
02:01:24,120 --> 02:01:27,510
* The more I have to go

1746
02:01:27,600 --> 02:01:31,115
* What's wrong with wanting more?

1747
02:01:31,200 --> 02:01:35,352
* If you can fly, then soar

1748
02:01:35,440 --> 02:01:38,637
* With all there is

1749
02:01:38,720 --> 02:01:44,829
* Why settle for...

1750
02:01:44,920 --> 02:01:53,635
* Just a piece of sky?

1751
02:01:53,720 --> 02:01:57,190
* Papa, I can hear you

1752
02:01:57,280 --> 02:01:59,953
* Papa, I can see you

1753
02:02:00,040 --> 02:02:03,953
* Papa, I can feel you

1754
02:02:04,040 --> 02:02:06,076
* Papa

1755
02:02:06,160 --> 02:02:08,674
* Watch me

1756
02:02:08,760 --> 02:02:27,669
* Fly *
