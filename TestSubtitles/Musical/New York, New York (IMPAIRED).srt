the greatest party ever

on a bit of this history.

"War's end. It's over."

You here by yourself?

- No.
- Who are you with?

- My boyfriend.
- Oh. Can I get in touch anyway?

Hey. I know you from some place.
We met a few years ago at a party.

so I've got to see them because
I just was two years in the service.

friends and they are coming back.

- When they come back.

- Why not now?
- Then I'll never get to know you,

how wonderful you are. I'm serious,
even though I'm giving you a line.

and try it again?

All right, I'll...

77
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:21,829
Pardon me. Was that fellow
in the Hawaiian shirt disturbing you?

- Not crazy, just pushy.

I didn't know anything.

All right?
I'll take only a minute of your time.

88
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,840
Now, when I walked in there, I knew.

89
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,676
- I knew.
- You knew what?

90
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:20,179
That I wouldn't get
anywhere at this table.

a little small talk is in order.

- Shall I leave?
- Yes!

- I'll leave right now.
- Bye.

You expect me to leave after that?

and we'll avoid this.

in you, you'd go away.

00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:20,789
- So I have the brunette?
- Right.

156
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,334
She's a pain in the ass.

157
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:27,379
I spent 20 minutes
giving her every routine I knew.

158
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,882
It didn't work. There was nothing.

159
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,383
- The one over there?
- Yeah.

160
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:35,554
That one, the W¤C.
Maybe the other one will go.

161
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:40,142
You got the good one,
I got the bad one.

162
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:43,395
- I don't understand...
- It's V-J Day.

163
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:45,606
I want to get laid.
What's happening here?

164
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:49,693
Oh, look at her now!

165
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:53,197
Look at that.
Look how cocky she is.

166
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:57,368
You know what I'm going to do?

167
00:17:57,535 --> 00:18:01,163
Go over and tell her
I was wounded in action.

168
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:06,585
I just got out of the hospital
and I'm shy and nervous.

169
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:10,839
Tell her I'm sensitive.
Lay it on like I'm a war hero.

170
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:13,592
- OK.
- Not too heavy. Indirect.

171
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,678
I'll wait over here
and then I'll come over.

172
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:19,348
Lay it on real well,
because I want to get her.

173
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:23,519
- Leave this to me, OK?
- All right. Wait, wait!

174
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:25,437
All right, OK.

175
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:28,107
- Wait, wait.
- What is it?

176
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:32,069
- Tell me what you're going to do.
- Leave it up to me. Take it easy.

177
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:35,781
What about the other thing? Sensitive.

178
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:38,701
- Sensitive. Sensitive.
- Oh, sensitive.

179
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:40,619
Oh, right. OK.

180
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,457
- Wait. What am I doing?
- What?

181
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:49,753
For her I'm doing all this?
I'm going with you. Just introduce me.

182
00:18:52,716 --> 00:18:55,300
Francine Flannery, Jimmy Doyle.

183
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:58,262
- Pleased to meet you.
- Ellen Evans.

184
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:01,473
Wrong. I'm Francine Evans,
this is Ellen Flannery.

185
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:05,477
- Remember her? You've been dancing.
- Let's go.

186
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07,104
He's such an animal.

187
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:12,192
- Be careful!
- I'll be right back.

188
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:15,154
Mind if I sit down now?

189
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:19,158
After all, we've been
formally introduced now.

190
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,326
We're old friends.

191
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:25,873
If you and I had danced,
it might have been a nice time.

192
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,584
I just gave my hotel key to my friend

193
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:31,045
because he's found someone
he's hooked on.

194
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:35,382
- That's very generous.
- Yeah, I thought so.

195
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:39,303
It seems
you give things away easily, huh?

196
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:45,642
- Did you have something in mind?
- For what?

197
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:49,521
For what you just said before.

198
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:53,692
Meaning would I give anything
of myself easily to you,

199
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,402
which I could do very easily.

200
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,571
He'll only be there for an hour or two.

201
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:00,282
Got any Juicy Fruit?

202
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:03,202
Sure.

203
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:07,539
Bye-bye.

204
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,060
I'll get her.

205
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:35,150
Eddie, if nothing happened
after four hours, why in the next hour?

206
00:20:35,318 --> 00:20:38,112
I'm gonna be there in one hour.
That's it. Bye.

207
00:21:00,218 --> 00:21:02,720
[Subway trains rattle]

208
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:44,261
[Francine] I'm sure it's Doyle.

209
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:48,307
[Clerk] I'm sorry, there's no Doyle
registered here.

210
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:53,896
A friend of mine is in that room
with a friend of his. Ellen Flannery.

211
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:57,149
It's quite urgent
that I get a hold of her.

212
00:21:57,317 --> 00:22:00,277
- Can't you just look one more time?
- Sure.

213
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:03,489
She's afraid of heights.

214
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:08,660
If it's too high and she gets dizzy,
it might be awful for your hotel.

215
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:09,828
[Clerk] Naturally.

216
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:16,919
Excuse me. Just a second.
Mr. Powell?

217
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:20,589
- That's him. Mr. Doyle!
- Mr. Powell!

218
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:22,758
- Mr. Doyle!
- Mr. Powell! Which is he?

219
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:25,177
Mr. Doyle. Jimmy Doyle!

220
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:35,145
I'd like to talk to you for a second,
please. Step right over.

221
00:22:37,524 --> 00:22:40,067
- Is there a problem?
- Only a minute.

222
00:22:40,235 --> 00:22:43,529
- Where's Ellen?
- Fancy meeting you here!

223
00:22:43,697 --> 00:22:48,826
Boy, you're a winner. Every time l
run into you, you cause me problems.

224
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:51,453
- What are you talking about?
- You just ruined it for me.

225
00:22:51,621 --> 00:22:57,501
He's calling the manager
because I'm here under an alias.

226
00:22:57,669 --> 00:22:59,878
We're all going to get arrested.

227
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:05,175
You'll have to get my suitcase and sax
because I have an audition now.

228
00:23:05,343 --> 00:23:08,971
If you mess that up,
I'm going to get even with you.

229
00:23:09,139 --> 00:23:12,141
I don't care how,
but I am going to. You ruined it.

230
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:14,143
- Mr. Powell?
- Get up there now!

231
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:18,063
I'm having a talk with my sister.
Do you mind?

232
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:20,816
- Yes, I do.
- Well, you'll have to wait.

233
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:25,154
Sis... Oh, please, Sis!
Now, Mommy's waiting.

234
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:27,906
She was worried for a few days...

235
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:31,869
Mr. Powell, please.
You've run up quite a bill with us.

236
00:23:32,037 --> 00:23:36,290
- Where were you before coming here?
- Where was l?

237
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:38,751
- That's right.
- Where were you?

238
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:41,378
Because you know where I was?
I was in Anzio!

239
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:43,714
Anzio!

240
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,675
I remember it now.

241
00:23:47,344 --> 00:23:50,596
- Fine, Mr. Powell.
- Wait, I get carried away. Sorry.

242
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:55,434
Five nights at the Commodore, three at
the St. Regis, room service at each.

243
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:58,896
In one case, use of the limousine.
Why do you switch hotels so often?

244
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,816
How could I even sign these checks?

245
00:24:02,984 --> 00:24:06,945
- These are your signatures.
- My signature hand doesn't work.

246
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:10,949
There's no life in that arm.

247
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:14,078
I might have it amputated tomorrow.

248
00:24:14,245 --> 00:24:17,581
Do I sign with my left hand?
I'm right-handed.

249
00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:19,541
Look at that signature.

250
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:22,252
Your sister will know
your signature, sir.

251
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:26,757
- Is that my signature?
- Yes.

252
00:24:26,925 --> 00:24:29,009
- Come on.
- That's your sister.

253
00:24:29,177 --> 00:24:31,637
- That's not my signature.
- Yes, it is.

254
00:24:31,805 --> 00:24:34,723
She's wacky.
You know, in the W¤Cs.

255
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:38,102
- Yes.
- Sister, you've got to go home.

256
00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:40,396
- No!
- 11 West 55th Street.

257
00:24:40,563 --> 00:24:43,482
- No! I'm not going to do this.
- Go home now!

258
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,651
- All right!
- Remember Anzio.

259
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:50,698
No, no. It's this way.
And right away.

260
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:53,283
- And I'll meet you later.
- Mr. Powell...

261
00:24:53,451 --> 00:24:57,079
This is harassment.
I'm not coming to this hotel.

262
00:24:57,247 --> 00:25:01,166
- I'm going to complain to the manager.
- Would you lower your voice?

263
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:03,293
I think you have a lot of nerve.

264
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:06,380
You see when that happens,
you can't explain why.

265
00:25:06,548 --> 00:25:11,468
- You see my leg. It's wood.
- That's terrible.

266
00:25:11,636 --> 00:25:13,846
It's the best kind of wood,
but it's a wooden leg.

267
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:18,851
I lost this leg so you could
accuse me of not paying hotel bills.

268
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:22,312
I can't believe this!
Would you push it off, please?

269
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:28,027
- Ellen! Honey, are you all right?
- I'm just great.

270
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:30,070
- Any last words?
- She...

271
00:25:30,238 --> 00:25:32,823
- Sorry, did I scare you?
- No.

272
00:25:37,829 --> 00:25:40,456
Good luck.
I've had her for three years.

273
00:25:40,623 --> 00:25:43,792
She's had every germ known to man,
Di Maggio.

274
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,961
- Di Muzio.
- Is this Jimmy's?

275
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:50,382
Can't you take a joke?

276
00:25:51,176 --> 00:25:53,218
Well, take good care of her.

277
00:25:53,386 --> 00:25:56,805
- What germs are you talking about?
- Killers.

278
00:25:57,807 --> 00:26:00,684
- This cab is...
- Excuse me, I need...

279
00:26:00,852 --> 00:26:02,644
Forgotten but not gone.

280
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:08,567
- 242...
- Hotel Alcott, please.

281
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:12,029
Just a second.
2842 Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn.

282
00:26:12,197 --> 00:26:15,366
- Do you mind if I take this cab?
- Do I have a choice?

283
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:18,160
No. I have an audition. Do you?

284
00:26:18,328 --> 00:26:23,540
I'm late for it. Come along.
You have nothing better to do, anyway.

285
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:27,252
- I was thinking of doing my nails.
- Brooklyn, or what?

286
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:30,839
I just said. It's going to be Brooklyn.
2482 Flatbush Avenue.

287
00:26:32,217 --> 00:26:34,510
2842 Flatbush Avenue.

288
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:36,095
Same thing.

289
00:26:37,764 --> 00:26:41,725
What about your nails?
Why don't you do them?

290
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:46,063
Why are you so serious?

291
00:26:47,691 --> 00:26:49,650
Come on, loosen up.

292
00:26:50,443 --> 00:26:53,320
Come on.
You gave me a hard time last night.

293
00:26:53,488 --> 00:26:55,280
Loosen up a little bit.

294
00:26:56,449 --> 00:26:59,785
Oh, come, come.
Let's have some gum.

295
00:26:59,953 --> 00:27:03,288
Best way to keep your mouth shut
and keep you occupied.

296
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,082
No, thank you.

297
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:10,212
- You're enjoying this ride.
- I'm having a hell of a time.

298
00:27:11,172 --> 00:27:16,135
I'm nervous because of this audition.
It's good to chew. It relaxes me.

299
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:22,641
God, I'm so nervous about this.
You make it worse.

300
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:27,813
- What did you say your name was?
- I didn't say.

301
00:27:27,981 --> 00:27:29,982
- You didn't say?
- No.

302
00:27:32,652 --> 00:27:34,653
- Would you do me a favor?
- What?

303
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:37,114
- Would you hold something for me?
- What?

304

- Yeah, just one second.
- You're kidding? That was it?

610
00:55:56,690 --> 00:55:58,315
- What?
- Your proposal?

611
00:55:58,483 --> 00:56:01,944
"Get your coat and shoes, let's go!"
That was it?

612
00:56:02,112 --> 00:56:05,656
- What's wrong with that?
- [Wife] They're not sure.

613
00:56:05,824 --> 00:56:07,991
We're sure.
What's wrong with that?

614
00:56:09,661 --> 00:56:12,037
I guess I thought
it was going to be different.

615
00:56:12,205 --> 00:56:14,206
It is different.

616
00:56:14,374 --> 00:56:16,750
- Anything wrong?
- Nothing.

617
00:56:17,794 --> 00:56:21,380
- They're not sure. Believe me.
- No, I just thought...

618
00:56:23,883 --> 00:56:27,302
- What?
- I thought it would be different.

619
00:56:27,470 --> 00:56:29,138
- It is different!
- I know.

620
00:56:29,305 --> 00:56:34,393
The kind of different I had in mind
was maybe sweet and calm and...

621
00:56:34,561 --> 00:56:38,772
It is calm!
I'm sorry. Just a little...

622
00:56:39,816 --> 00:56:42,276
And pretty, you know.

623
00:56:42,444 --> 00:56:45,279
- It's pretty!
- You can't say that.

- It is pretty.
- You can't say it's pretty.

I want to marry you!
Please, go inside. This is private.

Would you wait one second?

Did you hear what I said?
I want to marry you. OK?

What do you want me to do?

- Don't back up! Don't move!
- Now!

No, no! Don't shift,

Will you marry me?
I love you. Will you marry me?

636
00:57:37,248 --> 00:57:41,877
I don't want anybody else
to be with you. I want to be with you.

I don't want anybody else

- You liked that?

00:58:27,590 --> 00:58:30,926
- Yeah, I liked that.
- It was a lot better?

644
00:58:31,094 --> 00:58:33,429

- You missing a man?
- Yeah, Fowler. Did you find him?

649
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:18,891
Caught him in his room
with a local chick.

650
00:59:19,059 --> 00:59:22,770
- Big deal. So what?
- What do you mean? She's 13.

651
00:59:22,937 --> 00:59:27,691
The father started shooting out all

Fowler out. He's driving me crazy.

Could I do a couple
of my arrangements?

Not tonight. Just play the usual.

Come on! There are only
four people in the audience.

656
00:59:48,797 --> 00:59:51,674
I'm asking you to front for me.
Do you have to give me grief?

657
00:59:51,841 --> 00:59:52,925
All right.

658
01:00:29,671 --> 01:00:31,922
I'm cancelling the rest of the tour.

- Again?
- What do you mean "again?"

660
01:00:35,427 --> 01:00:38,971
This is the... fifth time

661

But I really mean it now.

662
01:00:41,933 --> 01:00:45,686
Then, I was jiving you.
I mean it. I'm going to pack it in.

663
01:00:45,854 --> 01:00:50,315
You remember we used to go out
and do 80, 85 one-nighters in a row.

664
01:00:50,483 --> 01:00:51,400
Yeah.

665
01:00:51,568 --> 01:00:54,403
Those joints aren't
ballrooms any more.

666
01:00:54,571 --> 01:01:00,159
They're parking lots, skating rinks.
The theatres are all bombed out.

667
01:01:01,286 --> 01:01:05,289
I've thought about letting
somebody else front the band,

668
01:01:05,457 --> 01:01:07,249
take a piece of the action.

669
01:01:07,417 --> 01:01:10,669
I wouldn't have to lift a finger.

670
01:01:10,837 --> 01:01:13,213
But only one guy can front this band.

671
01:01:13,381 --> 01:01:15,507
I know. Jimmy, right?

672
01:01:15,675 --> 01:01:18,010
No. Me.

673
01:01:18,678 --> 01:01:23,891
And if I go, the band goes.
It's game over. You know that.

674
01:01:24,059 --> 01:01:27,353
- Sure you won't have a little taste?
- No, you have it.

675
01:01:28,063 --> 01:01:29,480
Beautiful. I will.

676
01:01:32,484 --> 01:01:35,778
Maybe Jimmy would consider...

677
01:01:36,363 --> 01:01:39,031
You said he's good.
You think he's good.

678
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:43,702
He's not only good, baby.
He blows a barrelful of tenor.

679
01:01:44,704 --> 01:01:48,457
- But he's a pain in the ass.
- I don't want to start this argument.

680
01:01:50,502 --> 01:01:53,170
But he's a top pain in the ass.

681
01:01:53,338 --> 01:01:55,214
Top pain in the ass.

682
01:01:55,548 --> 01:01:58,175
You want to say it three times for luck?

683
01:01:58,343 --> 01:02:00,386
Three is my favorite number.

684
01:02:00,553 --> 01:02:02,888
Top pain in the ass.

It's not quite what I had in mind.

Yeah. Sorry, fellows.

I know it's not Frankie Harte.

We can do that stuff, too.
Just give us another chance.

691
01:02:37,007 --> 01:02:41,468
This guy must be crazy. I made a deal
with Frankie Harte and his Orchestra,

692

not Jimmy Doyle
and his Flying Sack O' Maniacs.

693
01:02:45,473 --> 01:02:48,809
This is Frankie Harte and his Orchestra,
without Frankie.

694
01:02:48,977 --> 01:02:51,562
Frankie wouldn't give us the band
if it wouldn't work.

- That's true.
- What do you have to lose?

What do I have to lose?
Does this look like a peanut gallery?

It looks like a place
that needs someone like me.

- Stunning, blonde.

Why do you want
to listen to the singer?
