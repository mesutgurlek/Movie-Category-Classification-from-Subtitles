303
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,831
- Food!
- Food!

304
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,996
- Food!
- Food!

305
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,674
- Life stinks.
- Are you talking to me?

306
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,996
- Yeah, you'll do.
- Great.

307
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,033
The name's Michael Carrington.

308
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,549
The name's Dolores.
Dolores Rebchuck.

309
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,070
Some call me Woodchuck
or Upchuck, but I prefer Dolores.

310
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,918
- Got it?
- Got it.

311
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,680
They think they're cool
'cause they got wheels.

312
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,317
- (PAULETTE) Dolores, go home.
- Looks like we don't make the grade.

313
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:04,196
With them it's all these weird codes
and rules and pledges about cycles.

314
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,394
You gotta be a biker or a biker's old lady.
Without a cycle, forget it.

315
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,319
- Pisses me off.
- We're in the same boat.

316
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,876
I sure can't afford a cycle without a job.

317
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,036
I'm willing to negotiate.

318
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:23,314
I offered to be a Pink Lady mascot.
It ain't the coolest job, but it's a start.

319
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:28,036
Think they'd listen?
Forget it. Pisses me off.

320
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,800
It's late. I'd better walk you home.

321
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,912
I don't need a babysitter, OK?

322
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:37,112
Why not think of it as a date, OK?

323
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,278
Why didn't you say so in the first place?

324
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,359
Come on. When I'm in 12th grade,
I'll be head of the Pink Ladies.

325
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,677
They'll rule the school.
They'll be the best.

326
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:52,192
We'll have the best-looking jackets.
I once tried to put letters on this jacket.

327
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,231
They fell right off.

328
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:59,673
It was really embarrassing 'cause
it happened in front of my sister Paulette.

- You could've killed us, Rhonda.
- Good move.

00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,279

- Oh, God.

I love your hair, Miss Mason.

339
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,870
Thank you, Mr Stuart.

340
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,470
Miss Mason will help you
while you're learning the ropes.

341

Follow me.

344
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:08,636
That's why we're gonna win this talent
show. 100 long-playing albumens.

345
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,753
- But we got zero talent.
- There must be ten Roy Orbisons there.

- Let's have a cigarette.
- Yeah.

350
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:42,798
- Uh-um.
- Mr Nogerelli. I've been looking for you.

351
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,514
Hello, Miss McGee.
You're looking lovely today.

352
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,188
There has been a rumour,
Mr Nogerelli,

353
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,190
that motorcycles have been driven
across our school lawn.

354
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,836
I know that couldn't have been you,
Mr Nogerelli.

355
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:01,591
I'm sure you have more respect
for grass than that. Right?

356
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:08,188
- Hear this. No more! Understood?
- Mm-mm.

357
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,712
Good. Do you smell something burning?

358
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,400
Mr Nogerelli...

359
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,433
I guess you sure told her, huh, Johnny?

360
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,839
- Water!
- Sorry, I'm sorry, Johnny!

361
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,314
I'll kill you!

362
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,150
- OK, we're ready.
- Good luck, girls.

363
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:32,638
The try-outs and we're the first.
I hope I don't blank out. Now!

These are my girls.
There's some good breeding up there.

369
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:04,436
And that is so important.

- Hey, what's happening?
- Hey, Woodchuck.

Dolores, all right? What's happening?

372
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,518
"Brad".

373
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,359
Does this song stink, or what?

00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,439
# Hear from Brad #

come between me and 100 LPs.

We're calendar girls. You have to
get into your seasons, become them.

Rhonda, you're fall.
Give me maturity, give me ageing...

- Give me a break.
- Lunchtime.

Thank you, but we haven't got all day.

- But these are my girls.
- I know, dear. Next!

OK, OK, we're almost ready.

their ah, ah, ahs.

Do I have to do everything myself?

- We still have three more seasons!

- I need the stage for my Drama class.
- Oh!

00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,072
Sharon, what about tonight?

409
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:43,029
- How about a hamburger later?
- I'm busy.

410
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:50,036
- How about tomorrow?
- Busy.

- I think he's in love.
- I think he's cute.

I think you should shut your yaps.

416

You forgot this one.

00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:12,119
# I want a cool rider

English, I got something scholastic
to discuss with you.

466
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,557
What I'm saying is
you're Mr History, right?

467
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,470
I got this essay on the fall of Rome.
I didn't even know they were in trouble.

468
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:37,717
- What are you driving at?
- Papers for paper.

469
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,753
Essays for cash?

470
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,628
- So that's it.
- What's what?

471
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:50,472
- It'll have to be a motorcycle.
- Good idea. Invest in a cycle. So?

472
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,910
- You've got a deal.
- All right.

473
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:57,079
When we make the drop,
not out in the open like this.

474
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,999
I got a rep to protect.

475
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,079
It's open.

476
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,716
Your uncle said you was back out here.
What is this joint?

477
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,037
- It's his nuclear fallout shelter.
- Yeah?

478
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,835
- You got that essay?
- You got the cash?

479
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,191
This is a neat joint.

480
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,109
A nucleoid shelter.
It's private, good for homework

481
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:43,279
and other activities
involving student bodies.

482
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,833
Mm-hm.

483
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:57,316
Can you handle a couple
of History assignments also?

484
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:01,354
- I'll try.
- OK, and remember, this is between us.

485
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:05,109
- I got a rep to protect here, OK?
- Yeah.

486
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,631
William the Conqueror, by the Goose.

487
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,911
Oh, God.

488
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:41,674
Nobody, but nobody,
knows this happened, dig?

489
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,030
Whatever you say.

490
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,589
That's very nice. Nice penmanship.

491
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,997
Remember. I got a rep to protect.
OK, Shakespeare?

492
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,395

493
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,553
Reproduction.

494
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:13,231
It's very simple, but yet very important.

495
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,433
Now, what is the best time of the month
for a woman to conceive?

496
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,030
Mr...

497
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,719
...Jaworski.

498
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:33,999
- What's "conceive"?
- You know, to be fertile.

499
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,954
- What's the best time?
- Ask Nogerelli.

500
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,953
- Mr Nogerelli?
- Ask Goose.

501
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:50,158
- Mr Goose?
- Ask Dimucci.

502
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,794
- Mr Dimucci?
- What?

503
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,878
Conceive. What is the best time?

504
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,798
At night?

505
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,117
I can see that we're not getting very far.

506
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,550
I got the same problem.

507
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,320
- Morning, everybody.
- Good morning.

508
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,114
Good morning, Mr Stuart.

509
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:18,512
- Let's start at the beginning. Page one.
- Open your book.

510
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:23,350
- "Where do babies come from?"
- If you need me, I'll be right over here.

511
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:26,120
Do we need this for the exam?

512
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,790
# The parts of a flower
are so constructed that

513
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,994
# Very, very often
the wind will cause pollination

514
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:42,194
# If not, then a bee or any other
nectar-gathering creature

515
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,949
# Can create the same situation

516
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:52,312
# Yes, anything that gets the pollen
to the pistil's right on the list

517
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:55,114
# I'll try to make it crystal clear

518
00:38:55,320 --> 00:39:00,758
# A flower's insatiable passion
turns its life into a circus of debauchery

519
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:08,276
# Now you see just how the stamen
gets its lusty dust on to the stigma

520
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:14,032
# And why this frenzied chlorophyllous
orgy starts each spring is no enigma

521
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,312
# We call this quest for satisfaction
a what, class?

522
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,954
# A photoperiodic reaction

523
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,037
# Oh, that's good
That's very good

524
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,514

Get back here. Get into your seats.

Next chapter.

536
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,430
Now, in an abstract way,
the same thing applies

537
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:58,632
to the reproductive organs
of the more complex life-forms.

538
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:02,594
But we are now dealing
with sexual response.

539
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,268
Are there any questions
before we begin reading?

540
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:09,075
# Is it possible the female member
of some sex on a couch

541
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,070
# Could, like, get this guy all hot
and she never even knew it?

542
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,554
# Negative

543
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,513
# When a warm-blooded mammal

544
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,872
# Starts pulling that stuff
she's saying that she wants to do it

00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,036
# Can't prove it by me

00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:28,312
# 'Cause they change their tune

Mr Goose, please be seated.

557
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,909
The human is the only being capable

558
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,395
of consciously controlling
his number of offspring.

559
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,830
Are there any comments on that?

560
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,314
I was wondering
if you could tell me where she lives.

561
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,397
- What is this?
- # Mr Stuart

Yep. Follow me.

One or two were my personal

00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,312
- "Steph..."
- Uh-oh.

761
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:27,434
Hiya, girls.

762
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:31,200
- Your boyfriend's here.
- (GIGGLING)

763
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:35,719
- Having a facial?
- Yeah.

00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:40,270
Delish!

00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:47,152
- Steph.
- What?

766
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:51,871
- Do you?
- What?

767
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:58,269
Have you... ever read
a Superman comic?

768
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:05,033
- Not in the last few hours.
- I was just checking. Right?

769
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:09,032

- Rhonda, you got a nose job.

771
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:18,270
- I walked into a door.
- So she says.

- (SIREN)
- Attention, attention, please.

This is a test. I repeat, this is a test.
Please do not panic.

774
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:30,716
Nuclear war is like football:
If the Russians throw the bomb,

775
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:34,549
you intercept it
and ram it down their end zone.

776
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:38,275
It's like life. Somebody throws
something, you throw it back.

777
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:41,313
Please proceed to your nearest shelter.

778

Boys to one side, girls to the other.
Run, run, run!

- Blanche, please do not panic!
- Miss McGee, it's so loud.

How did you talk me into this?

783
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:10,556
- You trust President Kennedy?
- Of course.

784
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:14,878
All right. Kennedy says we gotta be
prepared for a nucleoid war.

785
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:19,915
- It's nuclear, Louis.
- Yeah. Nuclelar, nucular...

786
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:22,634

some day, when you least expect it...

00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:29,310

The Russians are attacking. Get down.

- Think about it.

What if we died here tonight
without ever doing it?

801
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:57,597
"Lt"? Oh, my God! Let me out of here!

802
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:59,836

Are you sure my mother would approve?

Your mother don't even have to know.

And you think we're old enough to go?

- But, Louis, you might get hurt.

- Oh, God.
- Think about it.

817
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:05,752
It would be like doing it
for the Statue of Liberty.

- Or the Grand Canyon.
- The New York Yankees.

Yeah. Hold on. Just a second.

- Yeah, the creep, the story.

We don't care, Sharon!

871

I had this idea of Mr Right.

01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:13,314
- Right.
- Out of nowhere he shows up.

Isn't that kind of weird?

Not weird weird but, like, exciting weird.

So, what's the problem?

960

Maybe he's just not
everything I imagined.

- I figured out Hamlet's problem.

No ketchup.

966
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:05,791
- He got along OK without it.
- They never put ketchup on.

How can you eat a hamburger
with no ketchup? Shoot that over here.

You figured out the problem
with their hamburgers.

970

You know what his big problem is?

- Bite?
- No, thanks.

- Hamlet.

Oh, right.

975

"Hamlet went nuts when he caught
his mother doing it with his uncle."

976
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:47,071
- Not so great?
- You have the right idea.

977
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:49,077
But you could've said,

978
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:54,957
Hamlet was tormented by his mother's
incestuous relationship with his uncle.

979
01:13:55,160 --> 01:14:00,439
"Incestuous relationship"! Mason's
gonna flip when she reads this.

980
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:04,838
"Incestuous." You're a really
smart guy, you know that?

I just know a few big words
that impress English teachers.

986
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:29,876
You impressed me.
And I give credit to who I want, OK?

987
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:35,598
- To whom.
- To who, to whom, to you, that's whom.

988
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:40,635
- So learn how to take a compliment.
- All right.

989
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:46,952
- A hamburger for my friend. Loaded.
- With ketchup.

990
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:49,469
Double ketchup.

991

very scoreable broads at this joint.

- Me? Are you kidding? That's all I need.

996
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:12,680
- No, I wasn't.
- God, look, I didn't mean anything...

997
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:17,829
- We're just different types, that's all.
- Different types?

998
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:22,716
- What do you mean?
- Look, there's a Pink Lady code, OK?

999
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:25,832
Well, to quote Dolores,
"The code stinks."

1000
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:36,399
- Hi.
- What's this? Nerds' night out?

1001
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:41,833
- What are you, a cop?
- Sure picked up a lot of new friends.

ain't the class act no more.

Goose. Wait for me inside.

1004
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:51,476
- I don't want to eat alone.
- Go on!

1005
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:53,636
What do you want?

1006
01:15:56,280 --> 01:16:00,637
Yeah, well,

1007

...l'm officially declaring us
as an item officially over.

1008
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:08,235
- You're declaring?
- That's correct.

1009
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:12,592
OK, fine. You've declared it.
It's over. Can I go now?

You want to leave the party?
Leave the jacket. I got a rep to protect.

1014
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:36,552
So don't damage the rep,
we don't damage new friends, dig?

the nerd's brains over your brawns?

01:48:29,120 --> 01:48:32,237
# <i>And then I saw this angel</i>
<i>boppin' down the street</i>

1364
01:48:32,440 --> 01:48:35,273
# <i>I said, "Hey, pretty baby,</i>
<i>how's about a date?"</i>

1365
01:48:35,480 --> 01:48:38,358
# <i>She said, "I'm going to school</i>
<i>and I can't be late"</i>

1366
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:41,597
# <i>Well, I could see</i>

1367
01:48:41,800 --> 01:48:44,872
# <i>The look in her eyes</i>
<i>was sayin', "Follow me"</i>

1368
01:48:45,080 --> 01:48:47,913
# <i>I was caught</i>

1369
01:48:48,120 --> 01:48:51,157
# <i>I thought of playin' hooky</i>
<i>But on second thought</i>

1370
01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:57,549
# <i>I gotta go back, back,</i>
<i>Back to school again</i>

1371
01:48:57,760 --> 01:49:00,638
# <i>You won't find me</i>
<i>'til the clock strikes three</i>

1372
01:49:00,840 --> 01:49:04,037
# <i>I'm gonna be there 'til then</i>

1373
01:49:04,240 --> 01:49:10,634
# <i>I gotta go back, back,</i>
<i>Back to school again</i>

1374
01:49:10,840 --> 01:49:16,870
# <i>Whoa, whoa, I gotta go</i>
<i>Back to school...</i>

1375
01:49:23,160 --> 01:49:25,435
# <i>... Again!</i> #
