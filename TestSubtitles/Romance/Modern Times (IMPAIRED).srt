*Good morning my friends,

50
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,895
This record comes to you through
the Sales Talk Transcription Co, Inc,

51
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,772
Your speaker,
the mechanical salesman,

52
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,938
May I introduce
Mr, J, Willacomb Bellows,

53
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,017
inventor of the Bellows
Feeding Machine,

54
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:37,417
a practical device which
automatically feeds your men at work,

55
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,339
Don't stop for lunch,
Be ahead of your competitor,

56
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,690
The Bellows feeding machine
will eliminate the lunch hour,

57
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,892
increase your production
and decrease your overhead,

58
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,092
Allow us to point out some of the
features of this wonderful machine,

59
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,098
Its beautiful aerodynamic
streamlined body,

60
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:56,771
its smoothness of action made silent
by electroporous metal ball bearings,

61
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,289
Let us acquaint you
with our automaton soup plate,

62
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,299
it's compressed air blower,
no breath necessary,

63
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,616
no energy required to cool the soup,

64
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,778
Notice the revolcing plate
with the automatic food pusher,

65
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,660
Observe our countershaft
double-knee action cornfeeder,

66
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,418
with its synchromesh transmission,

67
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:16,090
enabling you to shift gears
by the mere tip of the tongue,

68
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,098
Then there is the hydrocompressed
sterilized mouth wiper,

69
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,690
Its factors of control insure
against spots on the shirt front,

70
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,936
These are but a few
of the delightful features

71
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,454
of the Bellows Feeding Machine,

72
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:30,539
Let us demonstrate with a worker,
Actions speak louder than words,

73
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,617
Remember,
to keep ahead of you competitor,

74
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:36,699
you cannot ignore the importance
of the Bellows Feeding Machine,
