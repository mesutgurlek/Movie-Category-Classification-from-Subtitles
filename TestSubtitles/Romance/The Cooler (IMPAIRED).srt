1
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,200
(woman laughing )
Yes!

2
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,200
Man:
Winner!

3
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Man:
You own this table!

4
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,400
Where's Bernie? They're killing us.
We need him here right away.

5
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,500
- Yeah!
- ( elevator signal rings )

6
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,600
( gamblers groan )

7
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,600
( groaning )

8
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,500
Woman: Come on, baby.
Come on, come on!

9
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,200
Come on!

10
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,000
- ( loud groaning )
- Seven out.

11
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,800
Woman:
Oh, man!

12
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:35,000
Man: Come to Papa--
Hey, what the hell?!

13
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,300
God damn it, that's supposed
to be an $800 jackpot.

14
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
- Man: Afternoon, Doris.
- Hey.

15
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,000
- Got any cream?
- Sure.

16
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,000
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, it doesn't matter.

17
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,800
Dewar's and--

18
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,900
Fuck!
Dewar's and water, please.

19
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,200
Hi, Natalie.

20
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,600
- Hey...
- Bernie.

21
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,800
Shit, motherfucker!
Yeah, Bernie.

22
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,300
Yo, Doris, have you seen
Shelly around?

23
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,400
He promised to position me
at the tables tonight.

24
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,700
I've been on skid row all week.

25
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,600
You didn't settle up
with me last night.

26
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,100
No? You sure?
Fuck, I was way under.

27
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,300
It's been like an AA convention
around here.

28
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,100
I'll make it up to you tonight,
I promise.

29
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,800
Where have l
heard that before?

30
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,600
- If I see Shelly, I'll tell him...
- Thanks.

31
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,500
...that you're looking for him.

32
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,600
Hostess on P.A.:
Conway, party of 1 1.

33
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,700
Please check your reservation
in the Paradise Lounge.

34
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,200
Hey, Bernie,
Shelly needs you on 1 1.

35
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,200
All right.
Let's do the Chivas Regal.

36
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,400
And have that--
have Natalie bring it over,

37
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,400
the one working the nickel slots
by the Paradise.

38
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,100
I spoke to Shelly earlier.
He wants her out on the tables.

39
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,500
All right.
I'll take care of it.

40
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,100
Great shot.
How about that?

41
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,800
Natalie:
Hi. It's you, right?

42
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,300
Yeah, over here.

43
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:21,000
Joe said
I should stick around.

44
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,800
You say something
to Shelly?

45
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,300
Um-hmm.

46
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,700
Wow, that was fast.
Thanks.

47
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,600
Don't mention it.
It's over here.

48
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,200
I'll win you a fortune
on five and nine.

49
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,600
Did you order
the Chivas Regal?

50
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,800
Hey, back off, will you, pal?
Can't you see I got a roll here?

51
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,100
- 54, 54.
- ( crowd groans )

52
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,400
- Seven out, line away.
- That motherfucker.

53
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,400
- Stickman: Thanks for the bet, folks.
- Yeah, yeah, I'm coming.

54
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,700
( cheering )

55
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,400
Oh! Shoot!

56
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,800
Better luck next time.

57
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,800
( fizzing )

58
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,900
- ( knocking on door )
- Ah-hh.

59
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,700
- Shelly, they're here.
- Relax, shorty.

60
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,000
Hey. Nicky, you didn't tell me
you were coming.

61
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,100
I'm having a manicure here.

62
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,400
You think I don't wash up
after going to the john, huh?

63
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,700
Forget about it. You look like
a million bucks. How are you?

64
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,600
You should have called ahead.
I would have sent the car.

65
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,700
- No, we figured we'd surprise you.
- Anytime, Nicky, anytime.

66
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,600
I know that, partner.

67
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,100
Shelly, let me introduce you to our
brightest VP here.

68
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,800
This is Larry Sokolov.
His numbers guy, Marty Goldfarb.

69
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:14,300
- How do you do, Shelly?
- Can I get you something to drink?

70
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,700
I'd love a vodka tonic,
thanks.

71
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,500
...comes out of the confessional and she
says, "Move over, I have to gargle."

72
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,500
( laughs )

73
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,600
So Nicky,
what brings you to town?

74
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,800
Shelly, I've got
a smart kid here.

75
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,800
He's got some good ideas
about how to revitalize the Shangri-La.

76
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:39,000
Revitalize? What are you talking about?
We did $35 million last year.

77
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,800
Nicky: Why don't you
just hear the kid out, huh?

78
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,600
Shelly, I want you to know that I have
nothing but the utmost respect for you.

79
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,100
You've done a tremendous job with
the Shangri-La over the last 16 years.

80
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,700
I don't think anybody
can dispute that.

81
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,600
Nicky:
Yeah, nobody doubts that, Shell.

82
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,600
But the business has changed.

83
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,100
Just take a look at the Strip,
you'll see what I'm talking about.

84
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,100
( chuckles )
What?

85
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,200
You mean that Disneyland
mookfest out there? Huh?

86
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,400
Come on, you know
what that is?

87
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,900
Huh? That's a fucking violation
is what that is.

88
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,100
It's something that used
to be beautiful.

89
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,900
It used to have class,

90
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,800
Iike a gorgeous high-priced hooker
with an exclusive clientele.

91
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,100
Then along comes
that Steve Wynn cocksucker

92
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,300
and knocks her up and puts her
in a fucking family way.

93
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,000
Now, she's nothing
but a cheap fat whore

94
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:30,700
hiding behind too much make-up.
I look at her and see her stretch marks.

95
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,400
It makes me want to cry, because
I remember the way she used to be.

96
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,300
Am i right?

97
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:39,500
There's no arguing the bottom line.
Those places are raking it in...

98
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,000
and the Shangri-La as she is now
can't compete with that.

99
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,700
You think I'm trying
to compete with that?

100
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,500
You think that's what we're about,
trying to bring in the stroller crowd,

101
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,600
fresh off some "E-ticket" ride, trying
to break the house on red and black?

102
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,500
Fremont has never been
about that bullshit.

103
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,200
This is where old time
and real money come to play.

104
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,300
The numbers don't back you up
on that, Shelly. Don't get me wrong.

105
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:02,300
Nostalgia is great
and we love nostalgia...

106
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,400
...but nostalgia
belongs in a museum.

107
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,700
I think it comes a time to decide
whether you're running a museum...

108
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,700
or you're running a casino.

109
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,800
Bernie.

110
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,900
"Mr. Cool."
You got a minute?

111
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,700
- I was just heading over to 14.
- It can wait.

112
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,200
How's the knee?

113
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,800
I met this orthopedic surgeon

114
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,300
at Vegas Memorial.
He tells me...

115
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,600
they can rebuild a man's
entire kneecap out of titanium.

116
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,000
Oh, of course it costs
a shitload of money,

117
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,600
but seeing as this gentleman is into us
for 500 large, I thought maybe--

118
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,300
I told you, I'm not gonna be here
after Sunday.

119
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,200
( dry chuckle )

120
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,700
Where are you gonna go,
Bernie?

121
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,300
Where the fuck are you gonna go
that's better than here?

122
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,400
I've got you covered in this town.

123
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,400
People know you work for me.
That's currency in your pocket.

124
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,500
That's fucking respect,
when you walk the floor.

125
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,100
Where are you gonna get that,
anyplace else?

126
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,700
Seven days, Shelly...
I'm out from under.

127
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,200
Excuse me, sweetheart.
What's your name, darling? Never mind.

128
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,100
This is who I am.

129
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,900
Yeah, that's right. I like to know who's
shopping it around in my neighborhood,

130
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,400
so what you do is be in my offiice
first thing tomorrow morning,

131
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,600
if you want to continue
to work here at the Shangri-La

132
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,300
and you and I will go over
the rules together.

133
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,000
I also want you to bring me a clean
bill of health. All right, my dear?

134
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,500
- Okay.
- All right, thank you.

135
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,300
How'd you like
to "birdie" that hole, huh?

136
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,900
Say the word and she's yours anytime.
I'll keep a running tab for you.

137
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,900
Nah.

138
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:44,200
What? What? She's not your type?
Are you kidding me?

139
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,300
I've got to go.

140
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,400
Things are heating up on 14.

141
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,000
Woman:
Let's do it in the room.

142
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Kim, I think we got our laundry
mixed up. I-- I'll talk to you later.

143
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,200
Come on, let's go back
to the room.

144
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:22,000
$50 bucks only gets you 20 minutes, man.
You're wasting your time.

145
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:40,400
Televangelist: Your soul is crippled.
I'm gonna change that.

146
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,100
Pray with me now.
Out, demon!

147
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,400
Let the crutches go!

148
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,200
Let the spirit into you!

149
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,200
( televangelist continues )
Run with me!

150
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,800
Kim: Fuck me harder!
Harder! Oh!

151
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,400
Oh, yeah, baby.
I like that. Come on.

152
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,400
- ( man moaning )
- Kim: Come on, come on.

153
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,400
- ( loud banging on wall )
- Kim: You're so big!

154
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,400
( Kim moans, screams,
laughs )

155
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,200
Televangelist:
You do? Hallelujah!

156
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:15,400
The Lord has shown
his face once again.

157
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:19,000
Kim: You gonna come all over me?
Oh, yeah, come all over me.

158
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,200
( banging faster,
Kim screams, moans )

159
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,800
Let's do this, man.

160
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,300
- Eight, the hard way.
- ( cheering )

161
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,000
- $900 for Mr. Pinkerton.
- Seven and Seven.

162
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:37,500
- Thanks, dollface.
- Jesus Christ!

163
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,700
- Shit, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

164
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,400
I'm so sorry.
I'm such a fucking klutz.

165
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,600
- No, this stuff happens.
- Oh, my God.

166
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,000
I'm sorry. This guy--
fucking hands all over my ass.

167
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,700
You might want to stick around.

168
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,800
Pinkerton:
I came to play.

169
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,600
Pinkerton: Come again, sister,
in the name of Pinkie.

170
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,500
Take this.
Hard eight, huh?

171
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,400
How you like that?
Suck on that.

172
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,600
That's right. Give me them dice.
Damn right.

173
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,800
One dollar,
hard eight.

174
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,200
Pinkerton: All right, everybody,
get in. Here we go.

175
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,300
We'll bet $10.

176
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,900
- Stickman: Out! Seven out.
- Shit! God!

177
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,900
What the fuck are you
smiling at, bitch?

178
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,900
Whoa, whoa... easy.
Fellas?

179
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,800
- You think it's fucking funny?
- Take it easy, man.

180
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,200
Think it's funny this place is stealing
my-- fucking numb-nuts, let go of me.

181
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,500
I'll have you fired, you piece-of-shit
bitch! Piece of fucking garbage!

182
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,900
~ But now I couldn't do
without my supply ~

183
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,800
~  I need you for my own ~

184
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,300
~  Oh, I can't break away
I must have you every day ~

185
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,900
~  As regularly as coffee
or tea ~

186
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,600
~  You got me in your clutches
and I can't break free ~

187
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,500
~  You're getting to be
a habit with me... ~

188
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,500
Oh, Shelly.
I love you, Shelly.

189
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,900
He's the man,
he's the best man. Salut.

190
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,300
- No, no, no.
- He hates that shit. He really does.

191
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,200
( music continues )

192
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,000
~  I used to think your love... ~

193
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,300
( distorted, slow )
~  Was something that l... ~

194
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,600
~  Could take... ~

195
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,200
~  Or leave alone ~

196
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:27,900
~  But now I couldn't do
without my supply... ~

197
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,300
- There he is.
- Hey.

198
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,900
Shelly, I was a fucking embarrassment
out there, do you understand that?

199
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,200
You should never have
talked me into going out there, Shelly.

200
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,600
I should have never let you.
Frank is rolling over in his grave.

201
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,700
I've got strep, man.
You understand that? I've got strep.

202
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:46,200
Listen to me, Pops, you were
pure velvet out there. It was just silk.

203
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
And also, looky-looky what was hanging
on the doorknob. Huh?

204
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,700
Forget about your tonsils.

205
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,300
When the muff confetti stops coming,
that's when you know you got trouble.

206
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,400
Did you get a receipt?

207
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,900
- Excuse me?
- They're on sale in the lobby.

208
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,600
Charlayne's. This is "Victoria's Secret
Valentine Collection."

209
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,700
What about that broad
you got coming here later?

210
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,200
How much did she set you back? Nothing
but the best for old Buddy, right?

211
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:13,600
Are you fucking kidding me?
Gimme, you don't deserve this.

212
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,500
You got all those ladies going home
with a nice breeze between their legs,

213
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,800
'cause you do it
the way they like it

214
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,800
and you're saying I'm some
Buddy Stafford ego pimp, huh?

215
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,100
Hey, fuck you
and-- fuck you.

216
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,800
Come on, give it to me.
Give it to me, man. Come on, come on!

217
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,600
Come on, don't be a prick.
Come on, man.

218
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:33,400
Come on, give it to me!
Come on, man.

219
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,500
( moaning )
Oh, fuck! Fuck!

220
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,400
( Buddy whimpers,
moans )

221
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,100
Do you ever watch
any of those nature shows?

222
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,600
What?

223
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,100
You know, those nature shows.
You watch them?

224
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,500
Yeah, I've seen
a few nature shows.

225
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,400
Yeah? Well, this one I've seen
about a dozen times.

226
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:06,700
It's about... Iions.
It's about...

227
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,300
the cycle of life of the lions...
and the leader of the pack.

228
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,500
- Pride. With lions it's a pride.
- Yeah.

229
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,900
This old king lion, right?
He's getting on in years

230
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,400
and then sooner or later
some young male comes along.

231
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:24,200
He challenges him... and he beats
the fuck out of this old lion, right?

232
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:27,300
He just kicks the shit out of him.

233
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,800
And then... then they push him
out of the pride...

234
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:34,400
and he has to go in the jungle
and scavenge and he dies alone.

235
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,400
The nature's got
some sense of humor, huh?

236
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,100
No shit.

237
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,000
See, but Shelly,
it's tragic because...

238
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,200
he's past it,
this old fucked lion...

239
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:49,300
and he doesn't know it
and it would be so much easier for him,

240
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,700
if he could just...
walk away.

241
00:16:53,600 --> 00:17:00,300
And... he could avoid all the pain
and the humiliation.

242
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,500
Hey...

243
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:07,100
that would be like accepting
that you were dead already, right?

244
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I think I like it better
nature's way, don't you?

245
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,300
Yeah, maybe you're right.
( weak chuckle )

246
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:17,400
( drowsily )
Yeah, that's it.

247
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,800
( murmurs )

248
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,600
Buy you a drink?

249
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,500
Yeah.

250
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,400
Marty:
Shelly, you got a minute?

251
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,000
Shelly, this is Johnny Cappella.

252
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,200
- How you doing, Shelly?
- I know you from some place, right?

253
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:03,100
Johnny's been opening
for Danny Ganz at the Mirage.

254
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,800
Now Sony is talking about signing him
to a three-album deal.

255
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,200
They're going to position him
as the new Harry Connick.

256
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,000
And I should be
interested in this... why?

257
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,800
Johnny's looking to headline.
I thought we might be interested.

258
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,100
- We?
- Did I come at a bad time?

259
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,100
Even if I was interested,

260
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,400
I got fresh ink with Buddy
for the next five years.

261
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,600
I just renegotiated his contract.

262
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,900
Listen, you two need to be
on the same page.

263
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,600
Larry, listen, if I don't
hear from you by Thursday,

264
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,100
I'm taking the Stardust.
All right? I'm going there.

265
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,100
- I understand.
- Johnny Cappella, gone.

266
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,700
- We'll definitely be in touch, Johnny.
- Capella: Assholes.

267
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:45,800
Your progressed
Venus is in Gemini...

268
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,100
12.5 degrees...

269
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,300
and it's in direct motion,
which means...

270
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,200
...you're a slow starter
when it comes to romance.

271
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Sorry. You know what?
This is real unprofessional of me.

272
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,400
I shouldn't discuss your chart
with you until I'm all done.

273
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,900
I can tell by the look on your face
you think this is all a lot of B.S.

274
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,900
No, I just... I know what
the outcome's gonna be.

275
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,500
There's not like one
particular outcome.

276
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,100
A lot of things come
into the picture, like...

277
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,900
- the planets, the moon phases--
- The outcome won't change with me.

278
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,500
- lt'll be all bad.
- Oh, my God.

279
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,400
I have never met anyone
who was so down on themselves.

280
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,600
Do you know
what I do at the Shangri-La?

281
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,800
I asked around.
You're a cooler.

282
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,900
- You turn winners into losers.
- Do you know how I do that?

283
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,100
Listen, I know there's a lot of stuff
that happens in casinos all the time.

284
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,400
Bernie:
I do it by being myself.

285
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:53,600
People get next to me, their luck turns.
It's always been that way.

286
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,400
Well, that sounds
like a self-fulfilling prophecy to me.

287
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,600
There's a whole chapter
of that in my book...

288
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,900
I only got six more days.

289
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,800
Well... really almost five.

290
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,100
I'm leaving town.

291
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,100
Only five more days?

292
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,700
Then we shouldn't waste
any more time.

293
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,100
You want to go back
to your place?

294
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,000
If this is--

295
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,800
I'm not sure...

296
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,000
I'm not sure I can afford...

297
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:39,300
- I can't afford to--
- Christ.

298
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:43,000
Oh, God. I'm sorry.
Wait, I didn't mean it.

299
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,500
( sniffling )

300
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,000
See, this is what I'm talking about.
I've gone and cooled the damn table.

301
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:52,900
Shut up, Bernie,
shut up.

302
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:56,400
You haven't gone
and cooled anything.

303
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,100
Not by a long shot.

304
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,300
Oh, God.

305
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,000
You know...

306
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,500
once they're dead,
they don't really grow back...

307
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,400
in case that's
what you were waiting for.

308
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,400
Oh, my God, you got a cat?

309
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:31,200
So... you got any music?

310
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,900
( slow jazz playing )

311
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,800
( door slams,
needle scratching )

312
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,200
( laughing )

313
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
- ( music resumes )
- Hey...

314
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,200
come here.

315
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,400
Sit.

316
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:10,100
( laughing )
Relax, Bernie, relax.

317
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,800
I assure you...

318
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,800
at least one of us
has done this before.

319
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,800
Bernie: This is not the first time
I've ever--

320
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,600
Surprise me.

321
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:34,200
- ( uptempo music plays )
- I like this.

322
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,100
~  Luck, be a lady tonight ~

323
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,600
~  Luck, be a lady tonight ~

324
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,100
~  Luck, if you've ever been a lady
to begin with ~

325
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,100
~  Luck, be a lady tonight ~

326
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:12,500
~  Luck, let a gentleman see ~

327
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:18,000
~  How nice a girl you can be ~

328
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:25,300
~  I know the way you've treated
other guys you've been with... ~

329
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,400
- They're snaps.
- Bernie: I think I can get it.

330
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:32,500
( laughing )
Ow! Wait. Pull down some.

331
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,700
- Okay.
- Ouch!

332
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:37,700
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. It's okay.

333
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,500
~  It isn't fair...~

334
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,000
Bernie: Oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, shit.

335
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:50,100
~  A lady doesn't wander
all over the room ~

336
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:54,700
~  And blow
on some other guy's dice ~

337
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,900
( moaning )

338
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:59,900
~  So let's keep
this party polite ~

339
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:05,900
~  Never get out of my sight ~

340
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:13,100
~  Stick with me, baby,
I'm the fella you came in with ~

341
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,000
~  Luck, be a lady tonight... ~

342
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,500
( moaning, gasping )

343
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,300
( Bernie screaming )

344
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,200
Bernie:
Sorry.

345
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:45,800
~  Luck, let a gentleman see... ~

346
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,900
It's okay, Bernie.

347
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,800
I've had worse.

348
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,600
Bernie:
Oh, shit. Oh, God.

349
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,700
( mutters )

350
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,500
I know I'm gonna pay for this,
I just--

351
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,900
I don't know who you are
or what-- I don't...

352
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:08,800
This was good and I'm glad.
I don't care.

353
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:16,400
You've got a great cock.

354
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,700
You've--

355
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,800
Thank you.

356
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,300
( muffiled voices )

357
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,400
( door latch creaks )

358
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,800
So...

359
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,900
want to go get some breakfast?

360
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,300
They've got these rules
about casinos hiring felons,

361
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:14,700
so he got me a gig
in telemarketing.

362
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:18,100
We were scamming pensioners
out of their retirement money.

363
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,500
I lasted two weeks.
( chuckling )

364
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,700
- Waitress: Here you go.
- Bernie: By that time...

365
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,700
I was really getting in deep.

366
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,700
I owed one of the casinos
over a hundred grand.

367
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,500
I put Shelly
in a really awkward position.

368
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,600
I don't blame him
for what he did.

369
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,900
What?

370
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,900
Your leg?

371
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,400
He did that to you?

372
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:42,500
- He shot you?
- No. Baseball bat.

373
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:45,000
- I got off easy.
- What do you mean you "got off easy"?

374
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:48,900
- I was out of control.
- He maimed you, for fuck's sake!

375
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:52,100
Listen to me.
I'm grateful for what he did.

376
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,500
I am absolutely serious.

377
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,900
Anytime I get an urge
to play off the clock

378
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,900
or so much as drop
a quarter in a slot,

379
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,400
I just reach down and feel
what's left of my cartilage.

380
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:06,400
- It's an excellent reminder.
- Jesus Christ.

381
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,800
I thought shit like that
only happened in the movies.

382
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,900
Anyway, Shelly and I worked out
a repayment plan.

383
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,700
Six years offi the books
at the Shangri-La cooling tables

384
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,800
- and in five days...
- Three.

385
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,800
( screaming )
Oh! Oh, shit.

386
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,000
Man: Oh, my God! Now?
Are you sure?

387
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,300
I'm going into labor.
Yeah, I'm going into labor.

388
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,900
( howls )
Ow-ww!

389
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,500
Deep breaths, deep breaths.
Stay very calm.

390
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,200
Okay, everybody, we're having
a baby, we're having a baby.

391
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,100
( screaming )

392
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,400
You fucking cocksucker!

393
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,700
Who puts their bag
in the middle of the fucking thing

394
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,000
so a pregnant woman
can trip over it?

395
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,100
( brief scream )

396
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,400
- Mikey?
- Bernie.

397
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,900
Mikey: I guess you're gonna be
a grandfather, Bernie.

398
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,400
Bernie:
Huh. Is this you?

399
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,500
Hey, what the fuck,
it runs.

400
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,300
Here, sit down.

401
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,900
- You all right?
- Yeah.

402
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,700
- Anyway, we've got to get out of here.
- Hey, Mikey.

403
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,500
How's your mom doing?

404
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,600
I'm gonna pretend
like you give a shit

405
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,900
and tell you she's getting by
as long as she's high.

406
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,900
Her name is Charlene,
in case you were wondering.

407
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,000
Hey, when's the last time
you saw a doctor?

408
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,700
About six months ago,
back in Jersey.

409
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,500
I wasn't about to go back there
after they treated me like cattle.

410
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,700
Just 'cause I had
no insurance, you know?

411
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,000
All those places are crawling
with TB from them spics.

412
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,500
Listen, Mikey,
if you want to...

413
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,500
why don't you drop by
the Bettor Life Motel,

414
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,500
give us a chance to...
to catch up?

415
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
maybe we'll do that.

416
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,200
Play catch up,
for the kid's sake.

417
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,700
( car engine roars )

418
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,900
( loud rock music
plays on stereo )

419
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,900
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

420
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,700
Dealer:
$100 minimum table, sir.

421
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:12,000
No offense, pal,
but there's 20 other tables here.

422
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,000
What do you want to come
sit on my head for?

423
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,700
I'm just gonna play one hand.
I'm feeling lucky tonight.

424
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,000
I've got this voice in my head
that says, "This is the table."

425
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,300
- lnsurance?
- No.

426
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:35,800
Oh, yes! Yes, yes!
( laughing )

427
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,100
Busto! Mel,
what's happening to you?

428
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,400
Player: Oh, yeah, welcome
to Mel's house.

429
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,500
Player: Hey, where are you going?
Stick around, pal.

430
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,500
You and me, we make
a great team. Hey!

431
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,700
What was that?

432
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,800
I mean, what the fuck gives?
Is it McGann?

433
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,900
The guy's been with me 1 2 years.
He's as stand-up as my fucking dick.

434
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,000
Maybe he's having money problems.
I'm gonna pull him.

435
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
- No, no, no.
- Was he counting them?

436
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,400
- The mook with the streak?
- Is there a problem?

437
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,800
No, there's no problem.
Fella's on a streak, is all.

438
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,700
Let me guess,
this is one of your "coolers"?

439
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,700
Why don't you announce it to the whole
fucking joint while you're at it?

440
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,000
They told me that you were a sticker
for the old ways, but coolers?

441
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,900
What is this guy, really?
A car mechanic? Some kind of shill?

442
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:51,000
'Cause he doesn't look
too effective to me.

443
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,100
- He's the best. Take it from me.
- All right. Sure. Whatever.

444
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:00,200
There are ways--
subtle ways--

445
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,400
that we can keep the odds
in our favor.

446
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:06,400
I'm talking about more
forward-thinking methods.

447
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,700
I'm sure you've got a whole prospectus
on the subject, right?

448
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:12,000
Well, as a matter of fact,
yeah, I do.

449
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,000
For instance,
I can tell you right off the bat

450
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:17,400
the wallpaper's not gonna cut it.
It's too uplifting.

451
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,800
I would suggest going
with some more muted tones.

452
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,900
- Wallpaper?
- Yeah. And personally,

453
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:25,200
I think the cocktail waitresses
could pop another button or two.

454
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:28,300
Myself, I wouldn't hire
anything less than a "C" cup.

455
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,300
- You know what that is?
- No.

456
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,900
It's music to be sure.
It's pleasant, not intrusive,

457
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,400
but recorded
at a subsonic level is a mantra.

458
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:41,800
"Lose... Iose... Iose."

459
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,100
We're just skimming
the surface, Shelly.

460
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:47,300
We really need to talk.

461
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,400
Shelly?

462
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,400
You better come quick.

463
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,400
Contact his daughter
and assist with the arrangements.

464
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,100
The Shangri-La
will cover all expenses.

465
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:28,300
- What about the Paradise?
- She's going dark tonight.

466
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,500
Er, that won't be necessary.

467
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,900
- ~  Can I steal a little love? ~ 
- ( applause, screaming )

468
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,300
~  Can I steal a little love? ~

469
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:48,400
~  Cool me honey,
I'm on fire ~

470
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,700
~  To steal your love
is my desire ~

471
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,100
~  Hug me, squeeze me,
till I'm red ~

472
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,600
~  Till my eyes
bug out my head ~

473
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,600
~  Coo me, woo me,
turtledove ~

474
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:07,900
~  Can I steal a little love? ~

475
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:11,900
~  Please tell me,
why are you driving me crazy? ~

476
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:16,200
~  Why do I dig you like I do? ~

477
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,400
~  If I should steal a little kiss,
and you can prove that it was wrong ~

478
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:23,000
~  Then I'll give it back to you ~

479
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,400
~  Honey, baby with a smile ~

480
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,800
~  I can walk you
down the aisle ~

481
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:34,100
~  I won't even need
a shove ~

482
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
~  Can I steal a little love? ~

483
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:43,100
Young lady, over here.
You want to give it a shot?

484
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,400
- Yeah. Come here.
- Five for $1.

485
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,300
- Thanks, Bernie.
- Good luck.

486
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,500
Are you ready?

487
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,000
Shit.

488
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,800
All right, double fisted.
( laughing )

489
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,800
- Damn!
- Too bad. Better luck next time.

490
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,800
- You want to try again?
- Yes.

491
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:07,200
- No, no, no. Thank you.
- Thanks.

492
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,600
- What?
- Nothing.

493
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,700
- What?
- You're an easy mark, is all.

494
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,600
- I'm an easy mark?
- You know where that comes from?

495
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,700
No.

496
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,900
Years ago, Shelly and me were working
Coney lsland for the summer

497
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:26,200
and when I'd see a guy who had a full
wallet and was willing to open it up,

498
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,100
I'd mark him with chalk.

499
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,300
I'd put it on my hand
and go something like,

500
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:33,100
"Hey, man, good work."
"Hey, buddy, how you doing?"

501
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:35,200
What the guy didn't realize

502
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,200
was that when he walked
down the way...

503
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:41,000
Shelly could spot him a mile off.
An easy mark.

504
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,500
Thanks a lot, Bernie.

505
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,700
I've got to sit.

506
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,900
( softly )
Hi.

507
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,700
( chuckles )

508
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,700
- You okay?
- Yeah.

509
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:25,200
Did you notice, last night,
that tattoo on my butt?

510
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,300
- Little Joe?
- Yeah.

511
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:30,400
Yeah, two 2's.
"Little Joe."

512
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,800
I had a son.

513
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,500
His name was Joe.

514
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,200
I was his mother for one year.

515
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,900
- You don't have to tell me this.
- No, I want to, Bernie.

516
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,300
I gave my son up for adoption.

517
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,700
I just wanted my life back.

518
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,700
I was 17 going on 18

519
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:08,000
and I was so fucking selfish.

520
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,000
My family didn't want nothing
to do with me after that,

521
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,500
so I hitched a ride out here

522
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,100
and thought
I'd make it as a showgirl.

523
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,800
10 years later...

524
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:27,000
I'd like to think that if it happened
when I was older,

525
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,200
with a guy that I cared about,

526
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,900
that it would have
been different, you know?

527
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:39,900
I think about my little Joe sometimes
and I do know I did the right thing.

528
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,700
I'm convinced of that.

529
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,500
( gasping )

530
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,100
Natalie...

531
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,900
I think...

532
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,600
I think I could kick your ass
at the dime toss.

533
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,900
( lightly sobbing )

534
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:28,400
( gasping )

535
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:01,000
~  You may not be
an angel ~

536
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:08,200
~  'Cause angels
are so few ~

537
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:16,400
~  But until the day
that one comes along... ~

538
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:21,000
- Would you do something for me?
- ~  I'll string along with you... ~

539
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,500
- ( banging )
- Bernie: Yeah!

540
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,900
( yells )
Yeah! Yeah!

541
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,500
- Natalie: Bernie!
- Yes!

542
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,800
( groaning,
banging on wall )

543
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,800
Natalie: Oh, yeah.

544
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,900
- ( slapping )
- Bernie: Ow! Ow! Jesus, ow.

545
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,200
- Natalie: Oh, yeah!
- ( Bernie groaning )

546
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,400
- Bernie, let's do it up the ass.
- Okay.

547
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,500
- Please, please?
- Okay, okay.

548
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,600
- No, my ass!
- Oh!

549
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:44,000
~  And until the day
that one comes along... ~

550
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,100
- ( Natalie laughing )
- Yes!

551
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,300
( Bernie groans )

552
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,800
Man:
Shut the fuck up in there!

553
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,400
( banging )
Did we wake you?

554
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:01,000
~  For every little fault
that you have ~

555
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,800
~  See, I've got three or four ~

556
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:16,300
~  The human little faults
you do have ~

557
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:25,800
~  Just make me
love you more... ~

558
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:46,700
I have to pee.
I'm always peeing.

559
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,900
Hey.

560
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,600
How did you get in here?

561
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,200
I told the desk clerk
Bernie was my old man.

562
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:05,200
He let us wait inside.
Is that cool with you?

563
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Bernie is out
looking for a parking space.

564
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,500
I must have taken the last one.

565
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:15,000
- I didn't get your name.
- Natalie, Mikey.

566
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,900
Tell me something, Natalie,
is he paying you?

567
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,900
Excuse me?

568
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:30,000
My old man,
is he renting your ass?

569
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:32,400
Because, otherwise,
I just don't get it.

570
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,400
I mean,
a loser like my pops

571
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:37,100
in the company
of some primo tits and ass?

572
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,900
It don't compute.

573
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,900
Is this enough
to get me a little taste?

574
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,000
Family discount?

575
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,500
- Are you kidding me?
- No, baby.

576
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:02,500
- Mikey!
- Hey, Bernie.

577
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,500
I told you we was
gonna stop by.

578
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,500
I thought you'd call ahead first.
We were at breakfast.

579
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,600
Hey. Hey.

580
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,900
You missed some.

581
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,900
Hey, that's nice.

582
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,600
- Hi.
- Hi.

583
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:28,600
You see, Bernie, the thing is...

584
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,400
we're kind of strapped.

585
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:35,600
I mean, Charly here
is expecting like yesterday.

586
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:40,000
And we don't have the dough to make with
the right nutrition for her and all.

587
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:43,600
So I was wondering
if you would like to invest a little...

588
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:47,500
maybe in your grandchild's future,
his well-being.

589
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:10,100
It's almost three grand.
That's all I got.

590
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:12,300
That's-- that's
very generous.

591
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:15,300
Bless you, Bernie.
You want to feel it?

592
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,500
You know, I really--
I don't think...

593
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,400
Oh-- I just felt a kick.
Come on, Bernie, give me your hand.

594
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:27,300
- You feel that?
- I don't know. I think so.

595
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,400
- Hey, we'll catch you later, Bernie.
- Okay.

596
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,700
Thanks.

597
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:35,400
Take care, Dad.

598
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:40,600
New Shangri-La Hotel and Casino.
We break ground on her in six months.

599
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,000
She's perfect.
Three floors of gaming,

600
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Imax theater,
entertainment center,

601
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,200
boutiques, restaurants, roller coaster.
You name it, we've got it.

602
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,900
She pays for herself in three years.
After that, it's easy money.

603
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,400
Isn't she great, Shell?

604
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:03,600
In "Lost Horizon, " these people,
their plane crashes in the Himalayas

605
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,600
and they get rescued,

606
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:09,700
Taken to this utopia
in the mountains, Shangri-La.

607
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:13,600
It's beautiful.

608
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:16,700
Totally isolated,
untouched by the outside world.

609
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:20,900
No war, no greed,
no bullshit.

610
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:23,300
Time has slowed down.

611
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:28,100
You never age.
It's paradise.

612
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:33,100
You see, that's what Shangri-La is.
It's paradise.

613
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:35,400
Yeah, we've seen the movie, Shelly.
What's your point?

614
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,800
My point is,
you don't fuck with paradise.

615
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:41,800
Come on. Jesus, Shelly.
Hey, we're not trying to fuck with it.

616
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,800
- We're trying to make it better.
- How?

617
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:47,100
How you gonna make it better?
It's perfect just the way it is.

618
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,400
It's the last of its kind.
It's pure.

619
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:52,000
This-- this is a fucking mockery.

620
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:55,900
How is it a mockery, Shelly?
It's right out of the movie.

621
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,800
Who's talking about a movie?

622
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:00,400
This is not a movie.
This is my fucking life.

623
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,900
Let me ask you one question,
where are you gonna be

624
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,800
when they decide
to change it back?

625
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:09,700
When people want the real Vegas again,
before all this "Epcot Center" bullshit?

626
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,400
Who's gonna give it to them?
You? I don't think so.

627
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:17,400
You know who? The same fucks
who started this in the first place.

628
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:20,100
You know what's gonna happen?
It's gonna come around full circle

629
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,800
and bite you on the fucking ass,
take my words for it.

630
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,100
Shelly, you make
some good points, huh?

631
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:29,400
Maybe we'll swing back the other way
someday. Who the hell knows?

632
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:33,300
But for now, this moment,
I suggest we shoot the dice.

633
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:37,600
My friend, I think
you should take some time

634
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,600
just to think things through.

635
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:44,100
I know this is a lot to digest,
I know that.

636
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,500
Wait up a second.
What do you say?

637
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,000
I thought we were gonna go eat.

638
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,900
Why don't you try this table over here?
It's a little less crowded.

639
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,100
No, let's play here.
It's my lucky table. I always play here.

640
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,400
Come on,
it's more private over here.

641
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:12,500
Shelly, I'm a big guy. I know
how to take care of myself.

642
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:16,100
Go ahead. I know how to find you.
Go ahead. Go eat.

643
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Here we go.
Come on.

644
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:24,400
- ( laughing )
- Stickman: Out! Seven, line away.

645
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,700
- What the fuck?
- Come on, "Pops." What the hell?

646
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:28,900
I could have paid my mortgage
with the money I just lost.

647
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:31,400
File a grievance, all right?
Shithead.

648
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:33,500
Come on,
give me two hot ones.

649
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:36,400
Stickman:
Come on, new shooter.

650
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,500
Nicky:
Give me 100 on right, 100 big yellow...

651
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,900
Woman:
All right, shooter. Come on.

652
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,900
Hey, hurry up, Gramps! Come on,
your soup's getting cold, huh?

653
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,400
- Stickman: Four, hard four.
- Give me $25 yellow.

654
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Hey, "Uncle Palsy"...

655
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,900
come on, throw them before you
fucking keel over and die, old man.

656
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,500
( laughing )

657
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:03,400
Be there!

658
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:06,900
Stickman: Seven, out. Line away.
Thanks for the bets, folks.

659
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:09,500
Don't take it so hard, Pops.
Everybody craps out.

660
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,700
( laughs )

661
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:18,000
Now go fucking change
your Depends.

662
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:21,400
( laughing )

663
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,400
( laughing )

664
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,900
That's good.

665
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,500
Who's laughing now?
Crack wise now,

666
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,500
you fucking "Ken doll,"

667
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:40,300
no-dick, suburbanite,
fucking scum.

668
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,900
Huh? Now how's that
for a game?

669
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,300
- Nicky, Nicky. Hey, it's all right.
- Get the fuck out of here!

670
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,900
- Disrespectful cocksucker!
- ( Bernie whistles )

671
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:49,700
Nicky:
How do you like the game so far?

672
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:57,000
Nicky, Nicky, take it easy.

673
00:46:56,900 --> 00:47:00,500
Come on. Come on, come on!
That ain't right!

674
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,000
The guy fucked up my whole game.
Who the fuck does he think he is?

675
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:05,200
You're right. Forget about him,
he's just a piece of shit.

676
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:07,500
- Let me see your hand.
- My hand is all right.

677
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:11,200
I got news for you. I thought this joint
had more fucking class, okay?

678
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,600
It used to be we didn't let a bum
like that in this fucking place.

679
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,500
Come on.

680
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,300
This town...

681
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:35,200
this town, you know,

682
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:39,300
all-- all I want to do...

683
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:41,300
is go some place
where I can tell night from day,

684
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:45,500
where they've got clocks on the walls.
I can't breathe here anymore.

685
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:49,900
Four days and I'm gone. I don't even
know if I can hold out that long.

686
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:53,000
So where does that
leave us, Bernie?

687
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,600
A week ago,

688
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:01,100
I couldn't even remember what it was
like to have a woman's hands on me.

689
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:05,400
I still pinch myself.
I'm afraid I'm gonna wake up--

690
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:10,100
Come with me.
Natalie, I want you to come with me.

691
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,200
- God, Bernie.
- I'm sorry.

692
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:14,100
I didn't mean to spring it on you.

693
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,500
I-- I've been working on this
compatibility chart, okay?

694
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:20,000
And it looks good,
really it does.

695
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,600
- So, what's the problem?
- The problem is it's only good here.

696
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:28,100
But that's just for now,
for the immediate future.

697
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:31,300
You know, when the planets realign...
maybe next year...

698
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:33,600
A year!? Natalie,
I can't wait another year.

699
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,700
I can't--

700
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,800
I can't go, Bernie.

701
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:02,400
- Hi, Doris.
- Hey.

702
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:18,200
Oh, shit.
Just a second.

703
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:22,100
Hostess on P.A.:
Chang, party of 15, your table is ready.

704
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:24,000
Chang, party of 1 5.

705
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:26,200
( group cheering )

706
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
- Woman: All right.
- Man: Come on, papa-to-be!

707
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:35,400
Come on, y'all.
I want to send my baby to college.

708
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,600
Six and a three,
five and a four. Let's go.

709
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,700
( group cheers )

710
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:43,700
This is for our baby's future.
Don't "blow " it.

711
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,600
- This is for you.
- ( laughing )

712
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:49,400
This one's on the line
for the guys with bowties,

713
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:52,200
- with shoes.
- Charlene: Oh, yeah.

714
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:56,100
Dealer's got shoes.
The point's nine.

715
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,200
Let's get that.
A six and a three, a five and a four,

716
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,800
Let's do it. Can we get it?
Can we get it? Come on.

717
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,200
- We got a shooter.
- ( cheering )

718
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:06,400
Hi, Bernie.

719
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:08,800
Man:
Fucking rock star!

720
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,000
( Mikey chuckles )
Give me them dice back.

721
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:14,000
Okay, pay me, moron,
pay me. Come on!

722
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:16,800
- Mikey: $9,000, $9,000.
- Give him $9,000.

723
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:19,000
Mikey: We're on a streak here.
Move it, move it, move it.

724
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:20,400
Charlene:
God bless you all.

725
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,400
Mikey:
Point is nine. Point is nine.

726
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:27,300
Let me get all the hard ways
for "Team Moron" here, okay? All right.

727
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:31,600
- Charlene: This is great!
- Mikey: For you guys, all right?

728
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,300
- Here we go.
- Charlene: Come on.

729
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:35,700
- Six and three. Five and four.
- Charlene: This is for the baby.

730
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:38,100
Mikey:
Come on.

731
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,700
( all cheering )

732
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,500
Charlene:
Oh, oh, careful!

733
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,900
Come on, guys, with the cigarettes.
We've got a pregnant woman here.

734
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:51,900
Put them out. I'm winning
you guys money. Come on!

735
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:54,400
Come on.
All right.

736
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:56,900
What gives?

737
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:01,100
He's up 18,000
since I stepped up to the table.

738
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,300
Sorry, Shelly. I'm kind of
hit-or-miss these days.

739
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:06,400
- $9,000, $9,000. Oh, baby.
- Oh, my God.

740
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,200
Oh, my God.
I can feel a kick.

741
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:13,100
( Shelly thinking )
Fucking amateurs.

742
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,700
Charlene:
Let's get it. Let's get it!

743
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:19,000
- ( group moans )
- Stickman: Nope. That's it. Line away.

744
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:24,600
Guys, I thank you.
My pregnant wife thanks you.

745
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:27,900
My unborn child
thanks you very much, okay?

746
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:30,000
Color me up, will you?

747
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,100
And keep one of these
little blue ones for yourself.

748
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:34,200
Thank you very much.

749
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:46,900
That's quite a run
you had there, champ.

750
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,900
( laughing )
Oh, yeah, lucky!

751
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,600
- Lucky night, I guess, huh?
- It's so exciting to watch, too.

752
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:55,200
If you don't mind,
I'd like to settle this in my office.

753
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:57,200
I don't like to lay out
that kind of cash on the floor.

754
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:01,800
We'll go up there, relax a bit,
have a drink, name your poison,

755
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:03,900
a little apple juice
for the mother-to-be here.

756
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,600
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

757
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,200
- Should I take this stuff with me?
- No.

758
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:24,100
( softly )
Yeah...

759
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:33,400
Okay, that is not
how I propose we handle this.

760
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:35,900
We turn this matter
over to the authorities.

761
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:37,900
They'll be blacklisted,
their credit ruined--

762
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:40,300
Then, I suppose I should stick
a fucking lollipop in their mouths

763
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:42,300
for the ride home, huh?

764
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,900
Let me tell you something, "Harvard,"
come upstairs with me in my office,

765
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:49,300
watch and learn how to protect
your investments the old-school way.

766
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,800
Fuck.

767
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,700
Mikey:
Ow, ow, ow... ow!

768
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:11,800
Shelly: All right. Here we go
everybody. Let's go.

769
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:16,200
Shelly? Shelly!
Shelly, wait a second.

770
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,400
Charlene:
Get offi me! No!

771
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:22,000
Shelly, wait. Wait!
Don't, don't. Don't do this.

772
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:23,900
Stay out of this, Bernie.
It's got nothing to do with you.

773
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,000
It's got everything to do with me.
He's my son.

774
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:28,200
Him? This little prick
is your son?

775
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:30,900
- Pop, you've got to help me out here.
- Shut up!

776
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:34,500
What are you talking about?
Wait, wait. Are you in on this?

777
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,800
- Huh?
- What!?

778
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:38,200
I asked you a fucking question.
You come clean with me now.

779
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:40,500
No! For God's sake,
what's the matter with you?

780
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:43,500
I didn't know nothing
about this!

781
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:48,000
Shithead here is your son?

782
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:51,300
( Charlene moans )

783
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,600
Let me ask you a question.

784
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,600
How much you think
their two lives are worth?

785
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:01,200
Myself, I don't think they're
worth piss, but hey, he ain't my kid.

786
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,000
This shithead was up
150 G's down there.

787
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:07,100
That's 150 grand that somebody's
got to account for.

788
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,500
What do you say you cover
them both, 75 apiece, huh?

789
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,100
Come on, Shelly.
They didn't get away with the money.

790
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,500
- You haven't lost nothing.
- Go to work.

791
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:18,400
- Mikey: Pop! Pop!
- No, wait! Come on!

792
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:20,400
- Jesus!
- Wait.

793
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:24,600
Bernie: All right, all right.
God damn it. All right.

794
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:27,600
All right, all right.
I'm good for it. $150 G's.

795
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:30,700
- I'm good for it.
- ( Charlene moaning )

796
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,000
- Natalie: It's all right, honey.
- Oh, my God, the contractions.

797
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:35,300
- I need to go to the hospital.
- Come on, Shelly.

798
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:38,600
Oh, for God's sake, Shelly.
Will you help her out?

799
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:41,400
- That's my grandkid.
- ( screams )

800
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,600
Oh, my God, that's right.
That's Bernie's grandchild in there.

801
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,800
You all right, sweetheart?
You need to go to the hospital, huh?

802
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,900
- Uh-huh.
- I'll bet you do.

803
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,100
( screaming )

804
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
- Jesus!
- Charlene!

805
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:54,500
( ripping, screams )

806
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,700
Hey, everybody look,
It's a boy!

807
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:02,300
Oh, can you believe this?
Bernie, you have a grandson!

808
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:06,000
( laughter )

809
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,900
Shelly: Bernie's got
a little grandson!

810
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:12,600
Isn't he cute? Isn't he cute?
I think he looks like you, Bernie.

811
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:15,900
- What do you think?
- ( laughter continues )

812
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:29,100
A nice healthy grandson.
Want to hold your grandson, Bernie? Huh?

813
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Break out the champagne, everybody.
Bernie's a grandfather.

814
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:39,100
You still want
to make good on this?

815
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
If you want to change your mind,
I don't blame you.

816
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,500
I'll make it up to you, Pop.
I swear.

817
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,600
I'm good for it.

818
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,700
- All right, up on the table, right now!
- Mikey: Whoa, whoa whoa--

819
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:06,400
Wait a second.
Shelly, we had a deal!

820
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,800
$150 G's buys their lives.

821
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:11,300
This is a little slap on the wrist
to remember me by.

822
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,700
- Mikey: Wait, wait.
- Bernie: No, no!

823
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:17,200
- ( screams )
- Jesus, Shelly, no!

824
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:19,300
- Come on.
- ( screaming )

825
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,900
( howls, cries )

826
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:34,900
Fuck!
I brought this on myself.

827
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:37,500
I planted the seeds.

828
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:42,000
When Angela had run off
with Mikey, I didn't--

829
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:45,800
I never made--

830
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:49,300
I never made an effort
to get back in his life.

831
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:52,100
I figured...

832
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:55,200
the kid don't need
a fucking loser for a father.

833
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:58,100
And now it's come full circle.

834
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,600
I give him the money,
I open the door to all this.

835
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:05,000
This-- I got this coming to me.
This is-- this is payback.

836
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:09,900
( slow piano
jazz music plays )

837
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:22,100
Are you done
beating yourself up, Bernie?

838
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:27,000
~  My funny Valentine ~

839
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:33,800
~  Sweet comic Valentine ~

840
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:36,200
~  You... ~

841
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:43,400
~  Make me smile
with my heart ~

842
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:54,500
~  Your looks are laughable ~

843
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:01,500
~  Unphotographable ~

844
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:03,700
~  Yet... ~

845
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:08,000
~  You're my favorite
work of art... ~

846
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:11,000
Bernie...
are you awake?

847
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:14,000
( brief grunt )

848
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:21,200
I think that...

849
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:25,000
I love you.

850
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:28,100
No.

851
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:32,000
I don't think.

852
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:35,300
I'm pretty sure of it.

853
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,300
You blindsided me,
Bernie Lootz.

854
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:45,500
I never saw it coming.

855
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:48,700
You shouldn't do that to a girl.

856
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,800
There's so many things
you don't know,

857
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:56,600
that you should know.

858
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:00,900
Oh, fuck,
I don't want to ruin this.

859
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:06,900
It-- it don't matter.

860
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:09,400
It don't matter
what you come clean about,

861
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:12,400
it's not gonna change
the way I feel about you.

862
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:15,300
It's not.

863
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,300
Natalie, l...

864
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:23,500
- I'd say it, but...
- Say it, just say it.

865
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,400
No, with my rotten luck--

866
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:30,800
Don't-- fuck rotten luck, Bernie.
That's over.

867
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:37,200
I love you, Natalie.

868
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:44,700
I really, really love you.

869
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:02,000

Trixie?

872
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:14,000
You came back?

873
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,100
( Trixie meows )

~  What a day this has been ~

876
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,300
~  What a rare mood I'm in ~

877
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:53,700
~  Why, it's almost like
being in love ~

~  There's a smile on my face ~

~  For the whole human race ~

881

~  I would swear
I am falling in love... ~

882
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:11,200
Tell Bernie to go to table six.

883
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,500
~  All the music of life
seems to be ~

884
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:19,100
~  Like a bell
that is ringing for me ~

885
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,700
~  And from the way
that I feel ~

~  When the bells
start to peal ~

( laughing )

891
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:48,800
Hostess on P.A.: Lovett, party of six,
your table is ready.

892
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:50,900
Duty calls.

893
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:54,300
Bye.

894
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:57,700
Yes!

Hey, Shelly, check it out.
The new "Mega Million."

906
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:57,500
I call her "Marnie."

907
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:59,400
You know,
'cause she's one frigid broad.

908
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:03,200
You want to tell me
what's going on out there?

909
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:05,600
- I don't know.
- What do you mean you don't know?

910
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:09,200
We're down almost a mil out there.
Doesn't that seem strange to you?

911
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:12,000
I guess I'm having an off day.

912
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:14,500
No, no, no.
You don't have off days, Lootz.

913
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:17,100
You're shitty luck incarnate.
What's wrong?

914
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:19,400
You coming down with something?
You have this look about you.

915
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:22,900
No, no, I'm fine. As a matter of fact,
I've never been better.

916
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:26,000
- Give it a shot.
- What's that supposed to mean?

917
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,600
She loves me, Shelly.
She told me last night. Natalie.

918
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:31,400
( siren wails,
bell rings )

919
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:33,900
Should I get her flowers
or candy?

920
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:36,800
What is happening
to you?

921
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:38,800
I think flowers.

922
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:41,600
Sweet Jesus!
You popped her cherries!

923
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:43,100
Shut the fuck up!

924
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:44,900
- Man: I'll stay.
- Natalie: Scotch on the rocks.

925
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:47,300
- Here you go, babe.
- Thanks.

926
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:49,700
Hi, Tone.

927
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:55,900
( knocking )

928
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:00,600
Hi, Shell.

929
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:03,300
Do you believe
those fucking kids yesterday?

930
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:05,900
Don't worry about them, because
you and I have other problems now.

931
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:10,200
You have really fucked things up
big time, let me tell you.

932
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,900
I hired you to be
his "cooze" companion,

933
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:15,600
not the true love
of his fucking life.

934
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:17,700
But no,

935
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:20,400
you have to go and get all profound
on the poor schmuck.

936
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:22,400
"l love you, Bernie."

937
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:26,800
What the hell were you thinking?
Those four words of endearment

938
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:30,400
have cost this casino
one million and counting today.

939
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:34,500
I don't understand
what that means.

940
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,300
Lady Luck.

941
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:40,000
You've heard of "Lady Luck,"
haven't you?

942
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,600
- Yeah.
- That's what's going on out there.

943
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:46,400
Lootz is Kryptonite
on a stick.

944
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:48,300
He should have them
throwing ice cubes right now,

945
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:51,200
but instead I've got
a meltdown on my hands.

946
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:55,400
So here's the situation: you are out
of his life, before he even gets home.

947
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:57,700
Don't even tell him to his face.
Leave him a note.

948
01:04:57,700 --> 01:05:00,900
I'm gonna make some calls and you're
gonna be situated at another joint.

949
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:12,000
I don't think
I can do that, Shell.

950
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:15,800
Excuse me?

951
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:17,800
( louder )
I said...

952
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:19,900
I don't think I can do that, Shell.

953
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:22,800
It wasn't an act.

954
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:24,800
I meant it.

955
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:27,500
- You love him?
- Yeah.

956
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:30,500
I love the schmuck.

957
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:33,900
What the fuck is there to love?

958
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:37,000
He's a loser.
Always has been, always will be.

959
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:40,900
I thought you were a smart cookie
when I picked you out.

960
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:45,700
You do not want
to fuck with me.

961
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:48,300
Because if you do,
your next john

962
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:51,700
is going to be a fucking rattlesnake
in the fucking desert.

963
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:53,700
- Do you understand me?
- Yeah.

964
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:55,600
Get out of here.

965
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:57,600
( sobbing softly )

966
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:13,900
Hey, Natalie.

967
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:56,600
It doesn't matter.

968
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:19,600
Man: Look.
A six-card 21?

969
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:22,800
- ( players moan )
- Man: Please!

970
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,100
( players moan )

971
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:45,500
~  Can I steal a little love? ~

972
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:50,800
~  Yeah, let me raid
a little love. ~

973
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:54,900
( applause, screams )

974
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:58,000
Thank you, thank you.
You guys are too kind.

975
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,200
This next song I'd like to do for you
is dedicated to a friend over there.

976
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:02,600
Brianna, this one's for you.

977
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:08,700
I want you to tell me
the truth, Shelly.

978
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:12,000
Did you say something to Natalie?
Did you muscle her?

979
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:15,400
Jesus, Bernie. Is that what you think?
That I would fuck with your happiness?

980
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:17,600
That hurts me.

981
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:22,800
( mutters )
I don't know.

982
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:25,000
( Capella singing ballad )

983
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:28,600
This guy is all flash.
No soul.

984
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:32,200
I miss Buddy.
It's just not the same around here.

985
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:34,600
Buddy was tired.

986
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:37,800
I gave him the easy way out.
Things could have been so much worse.

987
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:41,100
"Gave him the easy way out"?
What are you talking about? He--

988
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:48,200
Buddy never would
have taken the buyout.

989
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:50,200
He would have stuck to his guns
right to the end.

990
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:52,700
They would have ended up hurting him.
I could not allow that to happen.

991
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:54,900
Jesus. You--

992
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:58,500
you sit here and you justify it
like you're Dr. Kevorkian or something?

993
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:00,400
Hey, listen to me.

994
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:02,400
I loved that son of a bitch,
but his time was up.

995
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:05,600
What was I supposed to do, leave him
to those corporate fucking scumbags?

996
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:08,900
What I did was a humanitarian thing,
that I have no doubt about.

997
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:14,300
And afterwards I held him in my arms
and I cried like a fucking baby.

998
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:18,900
What?

999
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:23,300
What is this fucking look
you're giving me now? What is that, huh?

1000
01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:32,000
Televangelist:
There are the sins of the flesh.

1001
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:35,300
There are the sins
of the gambling halls...

1002
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:38,800
- be it dice or in some cases,
- ( knocking on door )

1003
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:41,400
"the devil's thumbpapers. "

1004
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:13,600
Let's take off tonight.

1005
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:18,700
I can't do that.
I have an obligation to Shelly. He--

1006
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:22,300
Fuck Shelly.

1007
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:25,400
He doesn't give a shit
about you, Bernie.

1008
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:32,500
Let's just climb in your car

1009
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:35,700
and drive
the hell out of here tonight.

1010
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:41,000
I can't do that, Natalie.

1011
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:43,500
He'd come after me,

1012
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:45,900
because you're with me.

1013
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:51,000
I can't have that on me.

1014
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:06,300
( softly )
Okay.

1015
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:08,400
Okay.

1016
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:16,400
- Stickman: Winner!
- ( cheering )

1017
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:25,400
( cheering )

1018
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:58,400
( screaming )

1019
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:03,300
( screaming )
Shelly! Shelly!

1020
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:05,600
You have no fucking right!

1021
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:10,000
Shelly, you got
no fucking right!

1022
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:14,100
Shelly, I tried.
I couldn't do it.

1023
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,700
Shelly-- Shelly--

1024
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:19,200
I can't leave, Shell.

1025
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:22,200
Shell, I love him.
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

1026
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:24,500
You heartless fuck.

1027
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:29,400
I thought--

1028
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:35,600
Bastard!
I thought he was your friend.

1029
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:41,500
Who do you think you are?
Who the fuck do you think you are?

1030
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:43,700
( screaming )
You're nobody!

1031
01:12:43,700 --> 01:12:45,600
I could make you
disappear like that

1032
01:12:45,700 --> 01:12:47,800
and not one fucking person
would miss you.

1033
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:51,500
- Not one fucking person!
- Bernie would!

1034
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:54,600
He loves me.

1035
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:57,200
He loves me...

1036
01:12:57,200 --> 01:13:01,400
and that kills you,
doesn't it, Shell?

1037
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:04,900
That kills you!
That kills you, doesn't it?

1038
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:06,900
He was your only friend

1039
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,500
and you crippled him.

1040
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:11,500
You crippled him

1041
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:14,800
and he still stood by you,
but no more, Shell.

1042
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:18,600
The only friends you've got now
are the fucking guys on your payroll.

1043
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:23,300
You don't own me anymore, Shelly,
and you don't own Bernie.

1044
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:27,200
We're leaving here tonight.
I am taking him

1045
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:30,800
and there is not a fucking thing
that you can do about it!

1046
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:34,100
- And you will be all alone!
- Is that right?

1047
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,300
( screaming )

1048
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,400
( screaming )

1049
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:42,400
( sobbing )

1050
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,300
I love him.

1051
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:04,200
Natalie?

1052
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:08,300
Don't turn the light on.
I got a headache.

1053
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:12,400
Did you take something?
I've got aspirin, I've got--

1054
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:16,000
Yeah, I already
took something.

1055
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
What--?

1056
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:21,200
Oh, shit.

1057
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:25,800
Natalie, what--
what happened to the mirror?

1058
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:33,000
- Natalie?
- ( Natalie moans )

1059
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:36,600
No, Bernie, don't.
Oh, shit-- Bernie!

1060
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:38,800
Jesus Christ.

1061
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:41,200
Natalie, who did this to you?
We've got to call the police.

1062
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:45,500
- I thought, "Easy money."
- What are you talking about?

1063
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:47,600
Shelly.

1064
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:54,200
He paid me to get close to you,

1065
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,400
to keep you around.

1066
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:09,900
Shelly...?

1067
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:14,700
Yeah. Shelly.

1068
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:19,700
You were right that first night.

1069
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:23,100
I was for sale.

1070
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:28,100
Bought and paid for.

1071
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,700
You were the "easy mark,"
Bernie.

1072
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:38,500
At first I thought
that you were

1073
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:41,700
just another way to make
a quick buck, you know?

1074
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:46,900
And then I started
to take a closer look.

1075
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:52,500
Andforthefirsttime,

1076
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:55,800
you were somebody
who wasn't trying to hustle me,

1077
01:16:56,900 --> 01:17:00,000
somebody who wasn't trying to pretend
he was someone he wasn't.

1078
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:04,700
Just a decent guy,
trying to get back on track.

1079
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:10,000
And it didn't hurt any
that you put me up on a pedestal.

1080
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,900
It sure puts the gutter
in perspective.

1081
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:18,100
Shelly paid you?

1082
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:24,100
Shelly wants me gone.

1083
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:29,600
He says I bring you luck.

1084
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:32,800
"Lady Luck. "

1085
01:17:34,700 --> 01:17:38,500
I stayed to tell you to your face...

1086
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:42,600
and I knew you wouldn't
want me no more and I could just go.

1087
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:51,500
We've got to get you to the hospital.
We'll talk about this later.

1088
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:55,900
Tell me again, Bernie.
Tell me everything's gonna be okay.

1089
01:18:55,700 --> 01:18:58,500
Everything's gonna be fine.

1090
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:02,100
This is our time. This is you and me
and we're going for it.

1091
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,400
Oh, my God.

1092
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,900
Hey.

1093
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:12,500
You look in the mirror, you don't like
what you see, don't believe it.

1094
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:14,500
Look in my eyes.

1095
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:17,100
I am the only mirror
you're ever gonna need.

1096
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:19,800
You look into my eyes,
Natalie.

1097
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:32,200
Bernie, Bernie, wait, wait.

1098
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:34,200
Your chart that first night--

1099
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:37,900
I wasn't being straight with you.
It is the worst chart I've ever seen.

1100
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:40,000
There's nothing in the cards
for you, I'm telling you.

1101
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,900
No, don't you see?
That was before.

1102
01:19:42,900 --> 01:19:45,300
That was before you opened up
your heart to me.

1103
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:49,400
Everything's different now.
I got Lady Luck on my side.

1104
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:51,800
Nothing's gonna happen to me.

1105
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:53,800
Wait.

1106
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:56,800
Here. Look,
I got $3,000 he paid me.

1107
01:19:56,700 --> 01:19:59,100
Maybe Shelly
will take it as a down payment,

1108
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:01,400
and we can pay in installments,
when we get settled, okay?

1109
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:04,800
- I don't think $3,000--
- Come on, take it, Bernie!

1110
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,600
( Shelly talking )

1111
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:20,500
...street vendors in your face. I walk
up there, I'd want to shoot myself.

1112
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:23,100
I suppose you'd like
that freak show, huh, Harvard?

1113
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,200
Marty:
Yeah, I do.

1114
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:28,200
It brings people downtown into
the casino. That is good for business.

1115
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:36,600
- Oof!
- Hey!

1116
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:39,200
You lay another finger on her,
I swear to God, I'll kill you.

1117
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:42,500
Are you listening to me?
I will fucking kill you.

1118
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:53,200
Why, Shelly?

1119
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:58,400
How could you do that
to her?

1120
01:20:58,300 --> 01:21:01,100
Because I never let go
of a good thing, Bernie,

1121
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,900
and you are a very, very
good thing.

1122
01:21:03,700 --> 01:21:06,400
The best cooler there ever was
and I need him back.

1123
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:08,300
He ain't never coming back.

1124
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:11,800
That is a dead man talking.

1125
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:17,100
Shelly...

1126
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:21,600
I'm done with this joint,
Natalie and me.

1127
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:24,800
We are out of here.
I'll get a job out in the world.

1128
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:26,900
I'll send you half
my paycheck every month.

1129
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:29,300
- I'll make good on my commitment.
- Bernie, if you bail on me,

1130
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:31,600
they're gonna throw your fucking ass
off the roof of this building

1131
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:35,200
snatch the broad, and throw her
right the fuck on top of you.

1132
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:40,600
I don't think so,
'cause if you whack me,

1133
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:43,700
then Bernie Lootz ain't the biggest
loser in the world no more.

1134
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:47,000
That honor is gonna rest
upon you, Shelly.

1135
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:49,400
- And maybe you had it all along.
- I'm the loser?

1136
01:21:49,300 --> 01:21:51,800
What do you got,
other than this joint?

1137
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:53,900
- What more do I need?
- You got nothing.

1138
01:21:53,900 --> 01:21:57,600
This place-- your legacy,
it's a mirage.

1139
01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:59,700
You turn your back,
it don't even exist.

1140
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:01,700
There's no night,
there's no day,

1141
01:22:01,700 --> 01:22:05,400
it's just one big fucking blur
and it don't count for nothing.

1142
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:07,300
- You believe this fucking guy?
- ( thugs laughing )

1143
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:09,400
I feel sorry for you,
Shelly.

1144
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:11,400
You're the worst kind
of gambler there is,

1145
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:13,500
too scared to throw
his chips on the table.

1146
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:16,200
Too scared to extend
any real kind of friendship.

1147
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:18,900
Always scared he's gonna
end up out in the desert.

1148
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:24,400
Well, sweet fucking dreams, pal.
I'm out.

1149
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:26,400
If that's where it ends,

1150
01:22:26,300 --> 01:22:28,900
that's where it ends.

1151
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:32,800
Jesus Christ, that's such a fucking
touching speech, Bernie.

1152
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:34,800
All that Jimmy Stewart bullshit,

1153
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:37,600
I got such a lump in my throat,
I can't tell you.

1154
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,600
But it doesn't change a thing.

1155
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:45,600
If you don't make good on my 150 G's,
I'm gonna close the books on you.

1156
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:48,500
You and the broad.

1157
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:50,700
You leave me no choice.

1158
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:20,200
Change only.

1159
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:27,000
Dealer:
Change.

1160
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:31,600
$3,000.

1161
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:50,700
Yo, 11, pay the line.

1162
01:23:55,300 --> 01:23:57,600
Winner, seven.

1163
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:14,500
Stickman:
Six easy. Easy way six.

1164
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:16,100
( crowd murmuring )

1165
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:23,200
- Stickman: Winner. Front line.
- ( applause )

1166
01:24:38,900 --> 01:24:41,300
Hey, Shelly,
take a look at number four.

1167
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:44,200
- ( applause )
- Winner.

1168
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:54,200
Stickman:
Okay, folks, we're coming out now.

1169
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:57,000
Hold bets, curb checks,
C&E is 1 1.

1170
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,400
Man: Come on, man,
make me some money.

1171
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,300
Winner, seven.

1172
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:11,800
What the fuck is going on here?
Where have you been?

1173
01:25:11,700 --> 01:25:14,600
- Not now.
- Bullshit. Shut him down right now.

1174
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:16,900
- Shut him down or I will.
- Not here.

1175
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:19,100
Come take a walk with me.

1176
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:26,200
What is your interest in this, Shelly?
Because you know what I see?

1177
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:29,900
I see your guy taking us to the fucking
cleaners, and I'll tell you one thing.

1178
01:25:29,700 --> 01:25:32,200
He's not leaving here
with a fucking dime.

1179
01:25:32,100 --> 01:25:34,500
( screaming )

1180
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:42,600
Now listen to me,
you little Harvard turd.

1181
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:44,300
Lootz is all right,

1182
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:46,600
so he's walking out of here
with everything he's got coming to him.

1183
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:50,400
If you so much as touch
one fucking hair on his fucking head,

1184
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:53,500
I'm gonna fucking wallpaper this fucking
bathroom with your fucking ass,

1185
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:56,600
do you understand me?
Muted tones, isn't that what you said?

1186
01:25:56,500 --> 01:25:59,300
Huh? I can't hear you.

1187
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:01,400
Wait, wait a minute.
There it is.

1188
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:04,700
- ( gags )
- Blended in, at a subsonic level,

1189
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:06,700
Iike some kind of mantra,

1190
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:09,900
"Pain, pain, pain."

1191
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:12,100
- ( bone snaps )
- ( screaming )

1192
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:18,400
Please...

1193
01:26:21,100 --> 01:26:22,800
( applause )

1194
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:25,200
Man #1 :
Come on, come on.

1195
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:27,800
Man #2:
Big roll. Big roll, buddy.

1196
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,800
Man:
Here we go, here we go.

1197
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Man:
He must be up over 100 grand!

1198
01:26:43,100 --> 01:26:47,200
- Gray craps, line away.
- ( crowd gasps )

1199
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:02,900
Stickman:
Here we go.

1200
01:27:13,900 --> 01:27:15,900
Stickman:
Okay.

1201
01:27:15,900 --> 01:27:18,400
Man:
Hit it again. Come on.

1202
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:21,800
( crowd clapping )

1203
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:23,800
Man:
Come on now. Come on.

1204
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:28,800
- 12 craps. Line away. 12 craps.
- ( crowd gasps )

1205
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:48,800
- ( crowd murmuring )
- Man: What the fuck? Not all of it!

1206
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:51,100
Bernie:
$80,000.

1207
01:27:51,100 --> 01:27:53,200
On the field?
Is he fucking crazy?

1208
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:56,200
- Woman: Don't do it.
- ( crowd clapping )

1209
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:27,000
Thank you, God. Thank you, God.
Thank you, God.

1210
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,200
It's all right, right?

1211
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:33,300
You guys worked it out
and he took the money? It's okay, right?

1212
01:28:35,700 --> 01:28:38,700
( ringing )

1213
01:28:46,300 --> 01:28:48,600
( ringing continues )

1214
01:28:57,700 --> 01:29:00,100
( ringing continues,
knocking )

1215
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:03,800
You want me to get that, Shelly?

1216
01:29:03,700 --> 01:29:06,000
( ringing continues )

1217
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:12,100
( ringing continues )

1218
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:41,800
Bernie?
Can you tell me what happened?

1219
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:43,300
( deep sigh )

1220
01:29:43,300 --> 01:29:46,600
Yeah. Yeah.

1221
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:54,100
( panting )

1222
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:57,000
Why-- why are we stopping,
Bernie?

1223
01:29:56,900 --> 01:30:01,200
I think-- I think--
Oh, God damn.

1224
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:28,700
What the fuck happened
in there?

1225
01:30:34,700 --> 01:30:37,500
What? What?

1226
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:39,700
- What!
- Look. Look.

1227
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:42,000
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

1228
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,300
- Natalie, I won. I won.
- Oh, my God!

1229
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:46,500
- How much!? How much!?
- A lot.

1230
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:48,800
Bahamas, here we come.

1231
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:52,800
( laughing,
siren blurts )

1232
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:56,200
( tapping )
Step out of the car, please.

1233
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:02,000
- What's the problem, Officer?
- Step out of the car, both of you.

1234
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:15,700
Officer, my driving, it--

1235
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:19,100
I'm sorry if we were driving
a little fast, we're a bit excited.

1236
01:31:18,900 --> 01:31:22,400
We won a shitload of money
at the Shangri-La.

1237
01:31:22,300 --> 01:31:25,400
You didn't win nothing.

1238
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:32,700
Now both of you, turn around.
Get down on your knees.

1239
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:35,000
Now.

1240
01:31:37,300 --> 01:31:40,300
Jesus Christ, Bern,
Jesus Christ.

1241
01:31:44,300 --> 01:31:47,100
The kid just wants
you should know, Shelly,

1242
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,500
he's just protecting
our investment...

1243
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:51,700
...the old-school way.

1244
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:53,900
I'll see you around,
my friend.

1245
01:31:57,700 --> 01:32:00,700
I knew it was too good
to be true.

1246
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:05,100
Who were we kidding?

1247
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:18,800
( gun hammer clicks )

1248
01:32:25,900 --> 01:32:28,200
( loud crash,
dull thump )

1249
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:53,600
It's a drunk driver.

1250
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:57,700
This is just--
this is just freaky luck.

1251
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:59,800
It was freaky accident.

1252
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:22,200
Gentlemen, I want to thank you
for your vote of confidence.

1253
01:33:22,100 --> 01:33:24,700
As the new director
of casino operations,

1254
01:33:24,700 --> 01:33:28,300
I want to make a personal guarantee
to each and every one of you

1255
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:32,000
that your investment in the Golden
Shangri-La will be well looked after.

1256
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:35,200
The future looks very bright,
gentlemen.

1257
01:33:35,200 --> 01:33:39,000
Very, very bright.
