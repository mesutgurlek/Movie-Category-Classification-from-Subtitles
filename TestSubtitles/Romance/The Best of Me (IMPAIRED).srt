00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:43,419
AMANDA: OK, I'll go first.
l'm going to Tulane in the fall.

315
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,463
Double majoring in child
psychology and public policy.

316
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:49,260
L'm hoping to intern
at a law firm while l'm there.

317
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:52,632
And then after law school,
l'd like to work for a non-profit.

318
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,598
Maybe in another country,
that deals with children's issues.

319
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:58,005
- You wanna work with children?
- Mm-hm.

320
00:24:58,097 --> 00:24:59,940
You wanna have a family
of your own?

321
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:03,344
Yeah, I would.
l'd like to have a little girl.

322
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:05,972
Maybe name her Bea.

323
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:08,343
That's a real nice name.

324
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:13,545
Ifs really beautiful out here.

325
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:16,986
L've never seen so many stars.

326
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:21,392
I've always loved the stars.
I feel closer to them up here.

327
00:25:22,154 --> 00:25:24,464
When I was a kid,
I built my own telescope.

328
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:27,697
- Wow.
- No, it's pretty easy.

329
00:25:27,793 --> 00:25:29,966
Yeah, for you, maybe.

330
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:33,002
DAWSON: Humans have always
looked to the stars.

331
00:25:33,065 --> 00:25:35,568
Instruct their way of life,
consult them.

332
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,416
AMANDA: You were gone
for a while.

333
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,086
Yeah, my dad made me
quit school when I was 16.

334
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:47,322
He said he needed me
around the home.

335
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,318
How do you feel
about that'?

336
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:54,860
I don't know. I guess
I didn't like it much.

337
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:58,030
It was a hell ofa fight to
come back.

338
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:00,666
Is it weird to be there now'?

339
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,399
Kind of.

340
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:08,841
I mean, ljust
wanna finish, get out.

341
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:12,072
Where do you want to
go to college?

342
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:15,714
Do you think everyone goes
to college?

343
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:18,550
People who build
their own telescopes usually do.

344
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,556
(CHUCKLES)

345
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:22,182
I don't know, it's just...

346
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:24,853
ifs not something I can do
right now.

347
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:26,794
Is it something you want to do'?

348
00:26:28,287 --> 00:26:30,699
- Why do you care'?
- Why won't you answer?

349
00:26:32,858 --> 00:26:35,361
You are gonna be
a really good lawyer someday.

350
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,532
Do you want to go,
yes or no?

351
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:40,699
N0.

352
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,604
You're a bad liar.

353
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:48,483
I like that.

354
00:26:50,142 --> 00:26:52,144
DAWSON: I'd like to do this
again sometime.

355
00:26:53,045 --> 00:26:55,457
I'd even shower and show up.
How about that?

356
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:59,620
- (LAUGHS) You promise?
- Yeah, I promise.

357
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:45,806
I guess I wanted to do that.

358
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:49,812
I wanted to do that, too.

359
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:54,314
Good to know.

360
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:11,464
I wouldn't mind doing
that again.

361
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,562
Then do it.

362
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:34,154
MORGAN: Now first thing that Tuck
stipulated was for me to apologize

363
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:36,887
on his behalf for
any inconvenience.

364
00:28:37,316 --> 00:28:39,853
He asked that I pass on
his gratitude

365
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:44,025
for your being here
and your friendship always.

366
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:45,898
His words.

367
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:48,930
He would like you
to spread his ashes together,

368
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:51,371
outside the cottage
of Vandemere.

369
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:54,172
There is to be no funeral,

370
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:57,043
no reception,
nor store-bought bouquets.

371
00:28:57,102 --> 00:29:00,106
Not a dime is to be
spent on frivolities.

372
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:02,515
- Again...
- BOTH: His words.

373
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,281
(CHUCKLING) Thafs right.

374
00:29:04,376 --> 00:29:07,721
He asks that you pack up his things
and he would like you to go through it,

375
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:09,554
and take whatever you want.

376
00:29:09,615 --> 00:29:13,586
He left instructions that his assets
be liquidated and that the proceeds be

377
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:18,191
donated to the American
Pediatric Cancer Society.

378
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:23,301
The only asset not to be sold
is the cottage at Vandemere,

379
00:29:23,395 --> 00:29:25,875
which he left to you both.

380
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:29,812
Now, typically, in situations
like this,

381
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:31,642
one party will buy the
other out,

382
00:29:31,737 --> 00:29:35,275
unless you're interested
in joint ownership.

383
00:29:36,308 --> 00:29:39,118
- We're not.
- No. No.

384
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:43,719
When he was in the hospital,
he wrote these. Mm-hm.

385
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:51,730
(CLEARS THROAT) Excuse me. He would
like you to read them on your own.

386
00:29:57,262 --> 00:29:59,435
Well, you still living
around here?

387
00:29:59,498 --> 00:30:01,136
- Baton Rouge.
- Yeah?

388
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:05,776
- I see you gut married.
- 18 years.

389
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:07,783
Nice. You guys got kids?

390
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:09,910
- Two.
- Boys? Girls?

391
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:14,414
You know, we don't have to do this.
Ask the questions, tell our stories,

392
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,516
pretend to want to know
about each othefs lives.

393
00:30:16,615 --> 00:30:18,253
Well, I do want to know.

394
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,491
We're not here for a reunion.
We're here for Tuck, so...

395
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:25,261
How about this? You go to the house
today and I'll come out tomorrow.

396
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,997
And we'll meet out at
Vandemere tomorrow afternoon.

397
00:30:28,093 --> 00:30:29,504
We'll say our goodbyes.

398
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:32,134
- Does that work for you'?
- Yeah.

399
00:30:32,631 --> 00:30:33,632
Bye.

400
00:30:38,537 --> 00:30:40,278
L'm sorry.

401
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:46,020
<i>TUCK: You remember that thistle problem
I had in the garden last year.</i>

402
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:51,287
<i>Thistle is one tough weed.
You can't pull it or mow it.</i>

403
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,489
<i>You have to dig it out by the root.</i>

404
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:57,990
<i>While I was digging,
I got to thinking about you and Dawson.</i>

405
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:01,300
<i>You have wounds that
have never healed.</i>

406
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,364
<i>You've lived with them so long,
you don't even know they're there anymore.</i>

407
00:31:06,465 --> 00:31:08,342
<i>Pain has deep roots.</i>

408
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:14,576
<i>The only way to dig it out is to
forgive him and forgive yourself.</i>

409
00:31:16,308 --> 00:31:18,584
<i>- DAWSON: Don't you get bored out here?
- AMANDA: Completely.</i>

410
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,550
When are you gonna let me
get my hands dirty?

411
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:23,182
(LAUGHS) You want
to get your hands dirty?

412
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,922
Absolutely.

413
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,594
What? This dirty'?

414
00:31:27,686 --> 00:31:29,893
No. Dawson,
you're not gonna do...

415
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:32,195
'Cause I'm the grease monster
from the bayou!

416
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:34,100
(LAUGHING) Stop it!
Dawson! Don't!

417
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:38,004
You're gonna get rne all dirty,
you little punk! (SHRIEKS)

418
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:41,441
You gotta leave!
You gotta get out of here.

419
00:31:41,533 --> 00:31:43,706
- What?
- No, please, just get out of here now.

420
00:31:43,769 --> 00:31:45,749
- Who's that'?
- Get out of here, please! Leave!

421
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:47,441
- Dawson! You're hurting me!
- Leave!

422
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:50,179
- Don't ask any questions. Get out! Now!
- Why do I have to go?

423
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:52,347
- Go, go, go! Go, please!
- OK, Dawson.

424
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:53,890
- OK.
- Go!

425
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:55,117
OK!

426
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,258
Time to come home, Dawson.

427
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:09,197
You didn't introduce us
to your girlfriend.

428
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:11,798
That's that Collier girl, Pop.
You know her.

429
00:32:11,897 --> 00:32:13,467
- Collier girl.
- Yes, sir.

430
00:32:13,565 --> 00:32:14,805
(CHUCKLES)

431
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,710
All right, get your stuff,
put it in the truck.

432
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:20,272
- You're coming home with us.
- No, I'm not.

433
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,316
I ain't gonna tell you again,
boy.

434
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,048
I have had it with you, Dawson!

435
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:30,286
You're all puffed up,
you're thinking that you're special.

436
00:32:30,382 --> 00:32:33,386
Well, let me ask you something?
Do you really believe that that girl

437
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:37,764
is gonna have anything to do with
a white trash piece of shit like you?

438
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,330
No. Come on.

439
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:43,966
Get your stuff, put it
in the truck and let's go.

440
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:45,598
(cum FIRES)

441
00:32:45,664 --> 00:32:48,508
You touch him again,
the next one will kill you.

442
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:56,141
Now, I've come here for my boy
and I ain't leaving without him, so...

443
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:58,584
I guess you're gonna
have to shoot me.

444
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:00,182
All right.

445
00:33:03,615 --> 00:33:07,290
That windshield is gonna
cost you about $1 ,000.

446
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:09,832
And those floods run about
$500 each.

447
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:17,132
Do you want me to keep going?

448
00:33:20,432 --> 00:33:21,604
Go on now.

449
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:25,775
This is nice.
What you've done here.

450
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:27,882
Your wife plant these?

451
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:39,520
Get in the truck, Ted.

452
00:33:39,618 --> 00:33:42,224
(TRUCK STARTS)

453
00:33:50,729 --> 00:33:53,335

ljust shot up a $17,000

455
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,979
About broke my heart to do it.

456
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:04,249
They'll be back
whether you're here or not.

457
00:34:05,911 --> 00:34:09,916
Not safe for you to sleep out here
anymore. I'll fix you a place inside.

458
00:34:12,684 --> 00:34:13,992
Well, come on.

- I had to see you.

Well, after weighing everything
that we discussed,

01:47:14,929 --> 01:47:17,876
it is my recommendation that
we go all the way back to 1959.

1404
01:47:17,932 --> 01:47:20,879
We can look at the UN's declarations
of the rights of the child

1405
01:47:20,935 --> 01:47:23,074
and we can structure
our argument from there.

Good. Thank God for paralegals.

1407

make sure that we
