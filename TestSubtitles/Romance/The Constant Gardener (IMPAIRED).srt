to build up this international organization
called the United Nations,

- should not be determined
by narrow commercial interests.

00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,560
the wife of our representative
for aid effectiveness?

313
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,560
Pleasure to meet you.
How do you do?

314
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:21,160
And this is Dr. Bluhm
from Médecins dans I'univers.
Good evening.

315
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,080
Dr. Bluhm and I have met.

316
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:26,840
Yes, it was at the opening for the clinic
that didn't have the sterilizing equipment.

317
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,520
We never met; Dr. Ngaba;
but I know your work.

318
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,920
Do you know Sir Kenneth Curtiss,
Chief Executive ofThreeBees?

319
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,200
- Yes; also by reputation.
Good evening.
- Good evening.

320
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,720
[Bernard] It's the most successful
company here in Kenya.
We're very proud ofhim.

321
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,560
And which of the bees are you?

322
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,360
You were going to show us
the garden room, Porter.

323
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,360
There is just one thing
that I'd like to thank Dr. Ngaba for-

324
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,960
the free nevirapine.

325
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:59,440
He's, uh, persuaded the manufacturers
to donate it to H.I.V. -positive mothers.

326
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,440
It's a wonderful thing.
Shall we?

327
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,240
The problem is,
it isn't actually reaching them.
Some, but not all.

328
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,280
So we've been wondering,
is that a standard cock-up, Dr. Ngaba,

329
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,640
or- or were the pills converted
into the limo that you arrived in?

330
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,360
I think that's probably enough.
If you'll come through here, Doctor.

331
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,400
Justin.
Excuse me.

332
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:20,280
You've gotta do something about Tessa.
Well, what would you
like me to do, Sandy?

333
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,960
Well, she's embarrassing our guests.
Her and that bloody Bluhm.

334
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,680
There'll be hell to pay,
I can tell you.

335
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,880
Well, the- the squall
seems to have passed.

336
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,560
If you can't control her,
you should keep her locked up.

337
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,040
You're wanted on the veranda;
Mr. Woodrow.
Yes.

338
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,760
[Justin] The poinsettias
are so big here, they'll be best
towards the back of the border.

339
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,840
Hey, sexy.

340
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,760
You look divine.
Sandy, I think you're a pervert.

341
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,640
Stop looking at me like that.
We're to have a baby in a week.

342
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,640
Can I come and visit you
in the hospital?

343
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:08,800
You want to visit me in Uhuru?
Uhuru? Tessa, you're not
having it there.

344
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,680
Oh, Sandy, come on. Kibera women
have their babies there every day.

345
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,480
It's perfectly safe.
No, it's not. It's madness.

346
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,480
Just- Can I just choose-
Wait a minute. That looks a good one.

347
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,680
Shall we run away?

348
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,640
Yeah, come on then.
Take me for lunch.

I'm fine. Thank you. How are you?

I'm fine. Thank you.
How are you?

I'm fine. How are you?

355
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,680
- Look, near the car.
- Jomo is getting a test.

356
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,280
Of course. You told him to.
It was a suggestion,
not an order.

357
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,960
- What are they carrying
in those littlejars?
- It's probably saliva.

358
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,880
But that's not how you test
for H.I. V. Here; is it?

359
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,120
They're also testing for T.B.
Why?

360
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:04,080
When they test for H.I.V.,
they also test for T.B. Free here.

361
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,200
- What, just for free?
- A small extra service to humanity.

362
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,720
They're a drug company,
Arnold. Come on.

363
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:13,440
No drug company does
something for nothing.

Is there... something
you're not telling me-

I'm so sorry, Tessa.

00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,880
Gloria sends her sympathies.
What can one say?

370
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,960
It was a boy.

- Did Justin already tell you that?
- Tessa. Tessa.

Her name is Wanza Kilulu.

She's 15; and she's dying.

Kioko's 12.

380
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
He walked 40 kilometers
just to keep the flies off
his sister and her baby.

381
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,600
Perhaps that's the blessing.

No, Sandy,
if I tell you that that-

that that girl over there
was being murdered,
would you believe me?

No. No, I'm not.

but when we get it,

if I bring it to you, will you-will you
actually do something for once?

What you need is rest.
Now what I'm- I'm talking about
are coincidences.

out of this house?

Well, if you feel that strongly about it,
yes, Tessa- anything.

what's upsetting her.

It means informed consent.

Don't think I won't.

910
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:32,160
Hire the Abbey.
You can afford it now.
Can I?

911
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:36,880
Tess left you bloody well off.
Want to know what you're worth?
Not particularly.

912
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:41,160
Oh, I've got the keys to the Chelsea house.
Thought you might want to stay there
while you're in London.

913
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:43,240
No, I'd rather not.
Well, it's all yours.

914
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:45,680
That and her African women's charity.

915
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:48,280
Said it would get you
out of the garden.
When did she say that?

916
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:50,880
Two weeks before she died.

917
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:55,320
Look, I am ravenous.
Have you had lunch?

918
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:58,360
Yes, I have. A very civilized lunch
with Bernard Pellegrin...

919
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:02,400
who expressed an interest
in Tessa's diary.

920
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,760
But Tess never kept a diary.
She hated the things.

921
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:08,960
You and I know that.
Pellegrin must have been disinformed.

922
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:13,840
Tess thought she was being watched.
Didn't stop her e-mailing twice a day.

923
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:16,920
More inquiries than Google.
[Chuckles]

924
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,800
Look at him.
The boy is two-thirds machine.

925
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:23,200
I'm telling you; it's scary.
Mind of a computer.

926
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:26,720
Appetite of a waste disposal.
And what's the other third?

927
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:29,840
Oh, Manzini, unquestionably.

928
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:32,720
Those e-mails from Tess-
Guido helped me with them.

929
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:34,720
Company stuff. Boring.

930
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:38,440
Mm. Ownership, franchises,
that sort of thing.

931
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:41,040
I'm trying to find out
who brokered the marriage.

932
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:45,040
What marriage?
KDH and ThreeBees.

933
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:49,120
KDH make Dypraxa.
ThreeBees test it.

934
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:53,360
It's a marriage of convenience, of course.
Both in it for what they can get out of it.

935
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:56,200
That phrase about the marriage-
Is that Tess's phrase or yours?

936
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:58,560
Oh, hers. Hers.

937
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:02,680
[Whispering]
Producing dead offspring.

938
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:05,640
Oh, this is so good!
Why don't you try some.

939
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:08,560
It looks disgusting.
[Laughs]

940
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:11,440
I can get that stuff
through her mirror server.

941
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:14,800
Well, how do you do that?
All you need is the password. Duh.

942
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:17,240
Yeah, but I don't have her password.

943
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:19,840
Come on, Jus.
Five letters. Three guesses.

944
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:22,400
- I have no idea.
- My name- Guido.

945
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:26,040
She used the one for the "l"
and the zero for the "O."

946
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,880
- I set it up for her.
- Wait, wait.

947
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:33,920
- Give him a chance to read it.
- Lightning tour. I'm printing as I go.

948
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:38,160
[Justin]
What's Hippo?
[Arthur] Oh; I know that one.

949
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:40,880
German- German Pharma Watch.

950
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:42,880
Keep an eye on what
the drug companies are up to.

951
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:48,560
[Justin]
Copy that.

952
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:54,680
KDH. Can we open that?

953
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:57,240
Sure. No problem.

954
01:08:57,280 --> 01:09:00,200
[Man's Voice]
A new plague is sweeping the world.

955
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:05,720
In the 21 st century, multi-resistant
T.B. Will kill one in three.

956
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:08,800
- But now there is hope.
- It's huge, isn't it?

957
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:13,560
KDH is developing a revolutionary
treatment for T.B. Sufferers.
It's global.

958
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:17,960
We call it Dypraxa.
You will call it life.

959
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,040
[Arthur]
And I call it a blockbuster.

960
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:24,600
Karel Delacourt Hudson.
The world is our clinic.

961
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:27,600
[Arthur]
It's gonna sell like hotcakes.

962
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:31,920
- Can you magnify that photograph?
- Magnify it? He can send it out
for doughnuts.

963
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:41,040
Is it possible to zoom in on it?
Yeah, sure.

964
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:47,280
It's Pellegrin.
Why is he there?
