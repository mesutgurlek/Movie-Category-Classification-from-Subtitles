00:39:57,737 --> 00:39:59,295
Motherand daughter...

659
00:39:59,338 --> 00:40:02,466
were fated to wander
from village to village...

660
00:40:02,508 --> 00:40:06,535
dispensing
ancient cacao remedies...

661
00:40:06,579 --> 00:40:08,774
traveling with the wind.

662
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,584
Just as Chitza's people
had done...

663
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:13,744
forgenerations.

664
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:16,050
VlANNE:
Just as Chitza's people...

665
00:40:16,088 --> 00:40:18,249
had done for generations.

666
00:40:20,593 --> 00:40:23,391
Will it just go on forever?

667
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:30,458
Night, Mama.

668
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:50,760
l appreciate your coming in,
Armande.

669
00:40:50,799 --> 00:40:55,168
What's so important
that l had to postpone my nap?

670
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:57,569
l've got some chocolate cake.

671
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:09,947
Grandmother.

672
00:41:09,985 --> 00:41:12,715
Grandmother...bonjour.

673
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:16,918
May l...

674
00:41:19,294 --> 00:41:21,592
Would you like a cup of...?

675
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:23,495
No, thank you.

676
00:41:23,532 --> 00:41:26,433
l'm just here to do a portrait.

677
00:41:26,468 --> 00:41:28,026
Mm-hmm.

678
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:29,867
Whose?

679
00:41:29,905 --> 00:41:32,772
Yours, actually.

680
00:41:32,808 --> 00:41:35,276
VlANNE: ls the light OK
where she's sitting?

681
00:41:39,581 --> 00:41:43,608
l have something for you, boy.

682
00:41:43,652 --> 00:41:46,553
l've been carrying it around
since your last birthday.

683
00:41:50,325 --> 00:41:52,259
lt's a book of poetry.

684
00:41:55,597 --> 00:41:57,758
Oh.

685
00:41:57,799 --> 00:41:59,027
Thank you.

686
00:41:59,067 --> 00:42:01,763
You don't like poetry?

687
00:42:01,803 --> 00:42:05,034
Oh, no. Of course l do.

688
00:42:05,073 --> 00:42:06,301
Yes.

689
00:42:06,341 --> 00:42:08,036
Neither do l.

690
00:42:09,411 --> 00:42:12,005
lt's not that kind of poetry.

691
00:42:15,417 --> 00:42:18,716
And in a moment of weakness...

692
00:42:18,754 --> 00:42:20,745
l prayed to the Virgin Mother...

693
00:42:20,789 --> 00:42:23,724
to soothe Charly's soul
in his hour of suffering.

694
00:42:23,759 --> 00:42:28,719
You understand an animal
has no immortal soul.

695
00:42:28,764 --> 00:42:31,756
l understand, mon pere.

696
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,325
Yet you flout God's law.

697
00:42:34,369 --> 00:42:37,304
GUlLLAUME:
l'm weak and a sinner.

698
00:42:37,339 --> 00:42:39,068
PERE: What else?

699
00:42:41,343 --> 00:42:43,834
lmpure thoughts.

700
00:42:43,879 --> 00:42:46,905
GUlLLAUME: The woman
who runs the chocolaterie.

701
00:42:46,948 --> 00:42:48,245
Vianne Rocher?

702
00:42:48,283 --> 00:42:50,774
She suggested
l buy chocolate seashells...

703
00:42:50,819 --> 00:42:53,344
for the widow Audel.

704
00:42:53,388 --> 00:42:56,152
And, well...

705
00:42:56,191 --> 00:42:59,183
l guess that got me to thinking
about the widow Audel.

706
00:42:59,227 --> 00:43:03,129
At her age? At your age?

707
00:43:03,165 --> 00:43:06,965
Yes. And yes.

708
00:43:07,002 --> 00:43:11,530
And just what were you doing
in a chocolaterie during Lent?

709
00:43:11,573 --> 00:43:14,633
lt was for Charly.

710
00:43:14,676 --> 00:43:17,804
Again you flout God's law.

711
00:43:20,082 --> 00:43:24,746
Well, but if Charly
has no soul...

712
00:43:24,786 --> 00:43:28,187
then there's no harm
in him breaking Lent.

713
00:43:28,223 --> 00:43:30,657
GUlLLAUME:
lsn't that so, mon pere?

714
00:43:32,861 --> 00:43:35,352
Ten Hail Marys,
twenty Our Fathers.

715
00:43:36,898 --> 00:43:39,492
''Will she never have done,
then...

716
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:44,164
''that ghoul queen of
a million dead bodies?

717
00:43:44,206 --> 00:43:46,834
''l see myself again...

00:43:46,875 --> 00:43:50,038
''skin rotten
with mud and pest...

719
00:43:50,078 --> 00:43:55,414
''worms in my armpits
and in my hair.''

720
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:57,816
lt's perfectly wretched,
isn't it?

721
00:43:57,853 --> 00:43:59,514
Perfectly.

722
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:05,489
VlANNE:
Would you like some cake?

723
00:44:05,527 --> 00:44:08,052
Ahem. l'm not supposed to.

724
00:44:08,096 --> 00:44:11,691
Don't worry so much
about not supposed to.

725
00:44:19,074 --> 00:44:20,564
ARMANDE: Hmm?

726
00:44:20,609 --> 00:44:22,270
Live a little.

727
00:44:25,147 --> 00:44:27,615
Oh, her hair appointment's
almost done.

728
00:44:29,484 --> 00:44:30,781
l have to go.

729
00:44:30,819 --> 00:44:34,050
-What about my picture?
-Next time.

730
00:44:36,091 --> 00:44:37,991
LUC: Thank you forthe cake.

731
00:44:41,129 --> 00:44:43,859
Don't look so damn pleased
with yourself.

732
00:44:46,468 --> 00:44:48,766
[Knock on door]

733
00:44:52,774 --> 00:44:54,708
Stay here.

00:44:54,743 --> 00:44:58,611
[Pounding on door]

00:44:58,647 --> 00:45:00,672
[Pounding louder]

736
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:05,651
JOSEPHlNE: l did it.
[Laughs]

737
00:45:05,687 --> 00:45:08,622
l did it. He...

738
00:45:08,657 --> 00:45:10,625
He was so drunk.

739
00:45:10,659 --> 00:45:14,891
[Giggles]
He woke up.

740
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:17,956
He woke up.
He saw me packing, but...

741
00:45:17,999 --> 00:45:19,432
So he tried to come after me...

742
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:23,233
but l had already tied his feet
with his belt, and...

743
00:45:23,271 --> 00:45:24,932
Ha ha ha ha ha.

744
00:45:27,709 --> 00:45:30,405
Boom ! Right on his face.

745
00:45:30,445 --> 00:45:31,878
[Laughing]

746
00:45:31,913 --> 00:45:36,316
Right there
on his big, red face.

747
00:45:36,351 --> 00:45:37,841
VlANNE: Mmm.

748
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:43,616
VlANNE: Oh.

749
00:45:43,658 --> 00:45:45,819
Tsk. Ohh.

750
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:49,853
lt is so stupid, isn't it?

751
00:45:49,898 --> 00:45:52,992
l never blame him.

752
00:45:53,034 --> 00:45:57,801
Sometimes l even forget
what really happened.

753
00:46:01,076 --> 00:46:02,907
VlANNE: Now, now, now.

754
00:46:02,944 --> 00:46:04,878
[Crying]

755
00:46:06,815 --> 00:46:08,407
VlANNE: Shh.

756
00:46:10,318 --> 00:46:11,910
l saved her!

757
00:46:11,953 --> 00:46:15,047
You remember her father
collaborated with the Germans?

758
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:19,026
Nobody wanted to touch her.
Except for me.

759
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:20,960
And this is the way
she repays me?!

760
00:46:20,996 --> 00:46:22,361
Your anger is understandable.

761
00:46:22,397 --> 00:46:24,524
Anger?
Everybody's laughing at me!

762
00:46:24,566 --> 00:46:27,000
REYNAUD:
That is not your concern.

763
00:46:27,035 --> 00:46:29,367
Your concern is
the sacrament of marriage.

764
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:33,632
SERGE: Yeah, of course.
The sacrament.

765
00:46:33,675 --> 00:46:36,337
VlANNE: Dip the ganshbe
into the white chocolate.

766
00:46:37,679 --> 00:46:39,306
Like this?

767
00:46:39,347 --> 00:46:42,441
Good.
Yes, shake it, a little.

768
00:46:42,484 --> 00:46:43,473
Good.

769
00:46:43,518 --> 00:46:45,850
Put it on the parchment sheet.

770
00:46:45,887 --> 00:46:48,117
You're doing great.

771
00:46:48,156 --> 00:46:49,487

Oh. Good morning.

774
00:47:02,404 --> 00:47:06,101
Can l interest you
in some Nipples of Venus?

775
00:47:06,141 --> 00:47:08,905
Rumor has it that you are
harboring Madame Muscat.

776
00:47:08,943 --> 00:47:11,070
REYNAUD: ls that true?

777
00:47:11,112 --> 00:47:12,875
You make her sound
like a fugitive.

778
00:47:12,914 --> 00:47:15,382
She is a fugitive,
from her marriage vows...

779
00:47:15,417 --> 00:47:17,817
which have been
sanctified by God.

780
00:47:19,487 --> 00:47:21,045
Josephine?

781
00:47:21,089 --> 00:47:23,580
VlANNE:
Come out here a minute.

782
00:47:26,728 --> 00:47:29,526
Let His Radiance
have a look at you, hmm?

783
00:47:34,903 --> 00:47:37,633
VlANNE: ls that sanctified
enough foryou?

784
00:47:37,672 --> 00:47:38,798
It's not the first time.

785
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:40,705
l'm truly sorry.

786
00:47:42,711 --> 00:47:45,145
REYNAUD:
You should have come to me.

787
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:48,741
Your husband will be made
to repent for this.

788
00:47:48,783 --> 00:47:53,032
Tell him to repent
on someone else's head.

789

l'm going to make
an example of you.

ln there. He's ready.

793
00:48:02,142 --> 00:48:04,440
Well, but confession
must be made...

00:48:04,477 --> 00:48:06,536
in the spirit of contrition.

795
00:48:06,579 --> 00:48:09,070
Have you come
in the spirit of contrition?

796
00:48:09,115 --> 00:48:10,446
Contrition, yes.

797
00:48:10,483 --> 00:48:12,246

BAPTlSTE: Licentiousness,
idolatry, sorcery...

800
00:48:19,225 --> 00:48:21,216
gluttony, and drunkenness.

801
00:48:21,261 --> 00:48:23,752
Correct.

802
00:48:23,797 --> 00:48:27,460
And what are the three
conditions for mortal sin?

803
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,798
Serge?

804
00:48:29,836 --> 00:48:31,531
Mortal sin...

805
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:37,374
is sin whose object is...

806
00:48:38,645 --> 00:48:40,476
committed by...

807
00:48:40,513 --> 00:48:44,176

lncorrect. Didi?

809
00:48:46,419 --> 00:48:50,412
Mortal sin is sin
whose object is grave matter...

810
00:48:50,456 --> 00:48:52,924
which is committed
with full knowledge...

Gah!

00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:07,706
VlANNE:
So, how do you know...

815
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:09,799
if the coverture
is properly tempered?

816
00:49:09,843 --> 00:49:15,440
JOSEPHlNE: You check to see
if it's at body temperature.

817
00:49:15,481 --> 00:49:17,915
Then you dip
the palette knife...

818
00:49:17,951 --> 00:49:20,511
to see that the coverture
hardens on it evenly.

819
00:49:20,553 --> 00:49:21,577
Correct.

820
00:49:23,022 --> 00:49:24,216
Closer.

821
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:28,818
