1
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:38,634
Interior to command.

2
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:43,005
We've finished our sweep and we've got
one victim outside being treated by EMS.

3
00:00:43,843 --> 00:00:45,868
Do you got anyone else in there?

4
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:27,644
What a shame, huh? It was one
of the oIdest buiIdings in Georgia.

5
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,552
Ronnie, promise me
you'II make an effort, OK?

6
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:40,259
- Does Dad know she was arrested?
- Jonah!

7
00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:42,733
I didn't do it, OK? Stay out of it.

8
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:45,928
Just in time.

9
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:00,512
Wow!

10
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:03,685
- Dad!
- Hi, Joe-boy. How are you, man?

11
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:05,781
I'm great. How are you?

12
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:07,816
Here we go!

13
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:11,824
- I missed you. Look how big you are.
- Me too.

14
00:02:11,864 --> 00:02:14,492
You're Iike six-three now.

15
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:17,936
- You Iive on the beach?
- You bet.

16
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,302
That is awesome!

17
00:02:20,339 --> 00:02:23,274
- Don't go in the water.
- Be carefuI if you go in the water.

18
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:29,574
- How are you?
- I'm good.

19
00:02:32,251 --> 00:02:34,219
That's right, we have two chiIdren.

20
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:37,814
Hi, Ronnie. How are you, sweetheart?

21
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,354
Wow.

22
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:47,127
You have no idea.

23
00:03:35,681 --> 00:03:38,548
- Hi. Can I heIp you?
- Strawberry shake.

24
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:46,222
Here you go.

25
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:52,590
That's you, WiII!

26
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,235
I'm sorry.

27
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,744
- You OK?
- I wouId rather drink my miIkshake

28
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:11,750
- than wear it, but I'm fine.
- I'm sorry.

29
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:15,113
You Iook it.

30
00:04:15,187 --> 00:04:16,916
Forget it.

31
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:21,288
Hey, Iook. I reaIIy am sorry.

32
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,261
- Didn't we just do this?
- I'm WiII, by the way.

33
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:26,595
- Let me buy you another shirt.
- No, thanks. I'm good.

34
00:04:26,632 --> 00:04:28,657
Come on. I'm practicing
Southern hospitaIity.

35
00:04:28,734 --> 00:04:31,202
Is that what they caII
hitting on strangers now?

36
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:34,535
You know what? I have no interest
in buying you a shirt.

37
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,632
- Is that so?
- I'm just over here

38
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:38,576
so the other team can catch a breath.

39
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:44,610
- Pushy and conceited.
- Why don't you come watch.

40
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:49,146
I'II pass.

41
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:50,815
Thank you.

42
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,126
I'm gIad you were abIe to fix it.

43
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:04,330
Yeah. Ronnie did
a pretty good job with that.

44
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:09,137
Now I know what a piano Iooks Iike when
somebody takes a basebaII bat to it.

45
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:14,713
- You rehearsed that so many times.
- Is she stiII not pIaying?

46
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,907
Not since the day you Ieft.

47
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:20,111
Brian even bought her an eIectric piano.
She won't go near it.

48
00:05:20,152 --> 00:05:23,178
- An eIectric piano from Brian?
- Steve.

49
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:27,987
- How is she otherwise?
- WeII, Iet's see.

50
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:29,756
Grades were in the toiIet.

51
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,195
It's a miracIe she graduated
from high schooI.

52
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:36,327
And she doesn't have one friend
without a pierced something.

53
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:39,429
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

54
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,871
She toId you she got
into JuiIIiard, right?

55
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:44,808
No. Without pIaying?

56
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:48,041
They said they've been
watching her since she was five.

57
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:50,582
Not that it matters.
She says she's not going.

58
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:54,450
WeII, she'II make the right decision.

59
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:57,649
I'm gIad you're so sure.

60
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:04,258
- Kim...
- We hurt them, Steve.

61
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,662
EspeciaIIy Ronnie.

62
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:10,658
- We can try and pretend...
- I'm not gonna do this. OK?

63
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:14,400
Things happen. Nobody's perfect.

64
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,840
And Ronnie...

65
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,571
Ronnie wiII be fine.

66
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:27,242
A unicorn. How mythicaI.

67
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:30,584
I'd stick with the stained one
if I were you. Those suck.

68
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:32,453
Pretty much.

69
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,891
OK. Come with me.
There are some cooIer pIaces.

70
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,256
Let's go!

71
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,023
CaII, write, text, but communicate.

72
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,398
- OK!
- OK? I Iove you.

73
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,596
Got Iipstick.
TeII your sister I Iove her.

74
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:46,969
- AII right.
- Bye!

75
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:51,743
Bye!

76
00:06:51,777 --> 00:06:53,870
- Ready?
- Come on!

77
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,411
Bye, Mom!

78
00:06:57,149 --> 00:06:58,741
Thanks.

79
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:02,648
What is aII this stuff?

80
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:07,523
WeII, I am buiIding a stained-gIass
window for the church up the road.

81
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,823
I saw it. How did it happen?

82
00:07:09,895 --> 00:07:11,328
Nobody's certain.

83
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:14,423
They think it was some sort of accident.

84
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:17,629
- This is so cooI.
- Yeah?

85
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,505
UnfortunateIy, I'm not reaIIy Iooking

86
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:23,804
for an assistant right now, so...

87
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:26,538
Why not? No, Dad, I'd do it!

88
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:27,772
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

89
00:07:27,813 --> 00:07:30,304
- You want it?
- I'd do it for free!

90
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:32,317
- OK. You're hired.
- ReaIIy?

91
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,410
- Yeah.
- That's so cooI.

92
00:07:34,453 --> 00:07:35,818
What kind of name is BIaze?

93
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:38,015
A nickname my boyfriend,
Marcus, gave me.

94
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:41,150
My reaI name's GaIadrieI.
It's from Lord of the Rings.

95
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,562
My mom's weird Iike that.

96
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,155
Hey, I'm Iucky it wasn't Frodo.

97
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,628
How much?

98
00:07:49,668 --> 00:07:51,602
- Twenty.
- Too much.

99
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,434
Oh, wait.

100
00:07:53,472 --> 00:07:55,736
I'm sorry. Today, it's free.

101
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,470
- No, no. Stop.
- It's OK. I do it aII the time.

102
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:01,537
No. I can't. I aIready got busted once.

103
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:04,878
A woman with a record.

104
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,077
- PIease.
- I Iike that.

105
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,018
Stop it.

106
00:08:12,491 --> 00:08:14,982
- Dad's Iooking for you.
- TeII him you didn't see me, brat.

107
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:18,224
- Five bucks. And two for ''brat.''
- No way.

108
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:22,326
He's getting cIoser.
Don't make me raise it to ten.

109
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:24,529
Shut up.

110
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:28,563
I promise to make him take me on the
Twister three times so you can get away.

111
00:08:30,342 --> 00:08:32,742
- Nice doing business with you.
- Yeah, yeah.

112
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:36,171
CooI. So you Iive in New York?

113
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:40,083
Yeah, I do now. I'm from AtIanta.

114
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:43,315
I moved up north when I was 1 1 .

115
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,115
My dad moved here just a few years ago.

116
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,924
- Without you aII?
- IrreconciIabIe differences.

117
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,556
Think that's the phrase.

118
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:57,266
- He baiIed.
- FamiIies suck.

119
00:08:57,336 --> 00:09:00,169
I don't even Iive with mine.
I stay at Marcus' usuaIIy.

120
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:03,175
You have to meet Marcus. Let's go.

121
00:09:15,754 --> 00:09:18,222
- Hook me up!
- Yeah!

122
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:23,694
That's him.

123
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:39,570
Thank you, everyone.
Donations are accepted.

124
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:41,807
In fact, they're encouraged.

125
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,680
This is good, huh?

126
00:09:47,786 --> 00:09:49,947
Good to have a IittIe man time.

127
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:56,584
Ronnie never opens any of your Ietters.

128
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,028
ReaIIy?

129
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:01,624
Mom says it's because she has PMS.

130
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:05,295
Do you know what that is?

131
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:07,498
Dad, I'm not a IittIe kid anymore.

132
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:10,167
Means ''pissed at men syndrome.''

133
00:10:11,543 --> 00:10:13,101
Yeah.

134
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,611
So, WiII, you want to get out of here?

135
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:19,880
My parents are at some Iame-o
award thing with the governor.

136
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,182
They won't be home for hours.

137
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:25,951
- They must trust you.
- Imagine that.

138
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:32,855
My man! She teII you the good news?

139
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:34,263
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

140
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:38,464
Cassie wants us to pick up some beer
on the way home, so we got to do that.

141
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:41,132
You know what, man?
I'm gonna skip it.

142
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:45,075
No, no. HeIIo, heIIo.
Eyes right here, buddy. No.

143
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,840
No skipping it tonight.
Look. Listen to me. OK.

144
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:49,710
WiII yes. AshIey yes.

145
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:51,613
AshIey yes. Cassie yes.

146
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,175
Cassie yes. Scott yes!

147
00:10:54,219 --> 00:10:58,087
- Come on. Take one for team Scott.
- Where you been, buddy?

148
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:01,058
- You guys don't hang out with us.
- Get off him!

149
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:05,158
Get off him. I Iove you, WiII.
You're so butch.

150
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:07,893
AIways Iooking out for your friend.

151
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,842
Come on. Dude, come on.

152
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:39,024
Hey, Ronnie?

153
00:11:39,064 --> 00:11:40,463
Get me a drink?

154
00:11:40,532 --> 00:11:43,262
Is there something wrong with your Iegs?

155
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,865
I'II get it for you.

156
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:01,283
I'm sorry. Are we boring you?

157
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:03,585
I just don't drink.

158
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:24,735
It's Iike a... ''just say no'' thing?

159
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:35,719
Because you couId just say yes.

160
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:37,449
Stop it.

161
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:50,433
Don't ever touch me, ever again.

162
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:54,300
Sorry.

163
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,775
Jeez.

164
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:53,291
I'm going to bed.

165
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:20,219
Before I get compIeteIy grossed out,
you shouId know I'm in here.

166
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:22,727
- Get out of my room!
- This is our room.

167
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:25,286
OK? If you want to sIeep in Dad's room,
that's fine.

168
00:14:32,437 --> 00:14:34,837
- Hey, Ron?
- What?

169
00:14:34,873 --> 00:14:36,204
Don't get mad, OK?

170
00:14:37,342 --> 00:14:40,402
Can you just be a IittIe nicer to Dad?

171
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:44,246
I just reaIIy don't
want to Iose him again.

172
00:14:52,624 --> 00:14:55,787
Did you see his face
when he saw you here?

173
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:58,329
He was so excited.

174
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:01,298
Jonah, you never Iost Dad, OK?

175
00:15:01,366 --> 00:15:04,995
You never Iost him,
and you never wiII. I promise.

176
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:33,026
- Ronnie, can I taIk to you?
- Sure.

177
00:15:34,299 --> 00:15:36,995
- Where were you?
- Out.

178
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:41,935
WeII, it's aImost 1 :00, so...

179
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:43,942
You don't have to wait up for me.
I'm not 1 2.

180
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:46,342
I wasn't worried about you
when you were 1 2.

181
00:15:46,411 --> 00:15:48,106
And now you are?

182
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,718
If you're gonna be here,
you have to...

183
00:15:53,785 --> 00:15:55,946
I don't want to be here, Dad.

184
00:15:57,055 --> 00:15:59,523
That's just it.

185
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:02,492
I don't want to be here.

186
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:05,462
Is that not obvious?
Do you not get that?

187
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:08,762
Yeah. Let's make the best of it, OK?

188
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:12,527
Are you gonna pIay?

189
00:16:15,707 --> 00:16:19,006
Are you going to pIay? Because
if you are, I'm sIeeping outside.

190
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:34,053
- Hey, congratuIations on JuiIIiard.
- Why? I'm not going.

191
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:36,151
- That wouId be a mistake.
- WeII,

192
00:16:36,194 --> 00:16:38,389
you and Mom wouId know about those.

193
00:16:38,463 --> 00:16:40,829
- I've Iearned from the best.
- That's enough!

194
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:42,231
Damn it, that's enough!

195
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:47,367
- It's OK, Jonah.
- I'm sorry, Jonah. Go back to sIeep.

196
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,069
I'II be there in a minute.

197
00:16:52,744 --> 00:16:56,737
If you're pissed at me and you
want to hurt me, fine, hurt me.

198
00:16:56,815 --> 00:17:00,444
Be mad, be angry,
but don't stop pIaying.

199
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,248
It's stupid, Ronnie.

200
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:06,081
It reaIIy is, and you're too taIented.

201
00:17:07,492 --> 00:17:08,550
Are we done?

202
00:17:23,608 --> 00:17:25,439
Let's go, Ronnie!

203
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,444
- Thanks.
- How about that?

204
00:17:27,512 --> 00:17:29,605
Ronnie, hey.

205
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:31,706
It's a new day.

206
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:36,018
Look, Iet's start over.
I got bacon here, got breakfast.

207
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:38,787
Vegetarian, Dad.

208
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:42,456
- Since when?
- A year and a haIf.

209
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:14,785
Must have found a turtIe's nest.

210
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:19,329
I'm not going near it. Must be sick
or something if it's out in the daytime.

211
00:18:20,198 --> 00:18:22,428
Sure is enjoying those eggs.

212
00:18:22,467 --> 00:18:24,697
What? No, no, no, no!

213
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,260
No!

214
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,073
Oh, my God.

215
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,033
She's Iosing it, Dad.

216
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:58,997
Big time.

217
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:12,747
A sea turtIe Iaid eggs.

218
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,412
The raccoons wiII eat them
if I don't keep them away.

219
00:19:16,354 --> 00:19:17,412
ReaIIy?

220
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:21,152
When a femaIe Iays her eggs,
the raccoons smeII them and...

221
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:23,093
They'II eat every one if they can.

222
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:27,990
This Web site toId me
to caII the aquarium

223
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:31,230
and see if I couId get someone
to come here and protect them,

224
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:34,204
- but my battery's dead.
- There's a number to the aquarium

225
00:19:34,272 --> 00:19:39,175
on the waII by the phone. HonestIy,
I don't know how they'II improve on...

226
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:41,076
On that.

227
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:46,248
Hey! Veronica!

228
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:48,912
No, Ronnie, it's fantastic. I Iike it.

229
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:51,080
You're overreacting!

230
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:58,990
- Hey, Dad, can we fIy a kite today?
- AbsoIuteIy not.

231
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:02,022
We're fIying three kites today.
AII of us.

232
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:03,932
You're dreaming, Dad.

233
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:08,805
Yeah. I'd Iike to report some
sea turtIe eggs outside of my house.

234
00:20:09,941 --> 00:20:11,670
Sure.

235
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:17,882
- What?
- You said ''outside my house.''

236
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,076
I Iike that.

237
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:22,780
Did you go to, Iike,
a nice guy schooI or something?

238
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:25,618
What's with aII your smiIing IateIy?

239
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:27,555
SeriousIy, it's creepy.

240
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:39,098
Is my...? Is my smiIe creepy?

241
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:40,866
WeII, I don't know. Let's see it.

242
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:43,101
I'm doing it.

243
00:20:46,444 --> 00:20:50,107
Kind of, but I think
you need to show teeth.

244
00:21:08,266 --> 00:21:10,734
My grandmother used
to drive one of those.

245
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:13,533
- She did?
- Yeah.

246
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,095
BareIy.

247
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:20,208
Is that miIkshake girI?
You shouId go spiII that soda on her.

248
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,371
Hey.

249
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:29,375
Hi. Nice Iook.

250
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,547
I aImost didn't recognize you
with your shirt on.

251
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:36,988
I'm sorry. I was stupid.

252
00:21:37,028 --> 00:21:39,223
- Yeah.
- It must have been the game.

253
00:21:39,297 --> 00:21:42,528
I get a IittIe... jacked up.

254
00:21:44,502 --> 00:21:48,199
You know, I Iaid awake that night,
just remembering it.

255
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:49,831
FeIt Iike a jerk for hours.

256
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,774
I seriousIy doubt that happened.

257
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:57,139
You're wrong.

258
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:02,044
I'II see you around.

259
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,217
I hope so.

260
00:22:11,262 --> 00:22:14,595
What shouId I caII you
when that happens?

261
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,759
- Ronnie.
- Ronnie.

262
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,034
Bye, Ronnie.

263
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:22,731
Bye.

264
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,978
You know who her father is, right?

265
00:22:36,087 --> 00:22:38,555
Yeah. So?

266
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:41,550
Just checking.

267
00:22:42,827 --> 00:22:46,024
Hey, what's up? Did the aquarium caII?

268
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:48,965
- I don't know.
- Oh, crap.

269
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,366
Hey! Hey!

270
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:54,102
Hey!

271
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,314
Hey.

272
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:49,386
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

273
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:52,919
- I asked you first.
- I'm here to mark a turtIe nest.

274
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,162
You work for the aquarium?
I thought you were a mechanic.

275
00:23:58,236 --> 00:24:01,330
- I don't work there. I voIunteer there.
- I caIIed yesterday.

276
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:05,733
- Is everything OK?
- No, everything's not OK.

277
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:09,406
- There were raccoons here aII night.
- ReaIIy?

278
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:12,675
- Where are they now?
- I scared them away.

279
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:15,811
Yeah, I'm not surprised.
I'm a IittIe scared.

280
00:24:17,555 --> 00:24:19,250
That's reaIIy funny.

281
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:21,884
You know, I'd Iike to see
you sIeep out here aII night

282
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,124
whiIe it's freezing with a basebaII bat
in your hand and raccoons terrorize you.

283
00:24:28,032 --> 00:24:30,660
- You reaIIy sIept out here aII night?
- No.

284
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:33,694
My hair Iooks Iike this aII by itseIf.

285
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:36,104
I wasn't gonna mention the hair, but...

286
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:43,407
This aII your creation?

287
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:47,144
- Do you have a probIem with it?
- Not reaIIy.

288
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:49,847
Other than the fact
that when the eggs hatch,

289
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:53,823
turtIes won't be abIe to get back to
the sea, so... they'II starve and die.

290
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:22,511
Hey.

291
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:26,586
BIaze.

292
00:25:27,992 --> 00:25:29,926
BIaze, what's wrong?

293
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:33,856
I saw how you Iooked at him.
At Marcus? I saw you.

294
00:25:33,898 --> 00:25:36,765
- What are you taIking about?
- I Iove him, OK?

295
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:39,804
- So stay away.
- I am not interested...

296
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:42,101
You're Iying!
I watched you fIirt with him.

297
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:44,573
The guy's a creep.
He was the one coming on to me.

298
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:47,407
Why wouId you want to be
with someone Iike that anyways?

299
00:25:47,478 --> 00:25:49,742
Excuse me.

300
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:52,545
- What?
- I'm sorry. I have to check your purse.

301
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:54,142
Fine.

302
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,620
I did not take that.

303
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:03,058
I didn't take...

304
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,223
You're gonna have to come with me.

305
00:26:16,174 --> 00:26:19,007
- Mom's gonna fIip out.
- Shut up. OK, Jonah?

306
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:21,739
Ronnie, don't taIk
to your brother Iike that.

307
00:26:37,061 --> 00:26:39,791
- Where you going?
- Home. Where do you think I'm going?

308
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:41,764
I'm caIIing Mom.

309
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:44,768
Let her go! Just Iet her go!

310
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:49,672
We had a reaIIy nice day,
and you had to ruin it!

311
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:53,802
Let her go! Let her.
Make her Ieave us aIone!

312
00:26:57,749 --> 00:27:00,616
How do you want me to respond, Ronnie?

313
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:04,110
- You want me to teII you it's OK...?
- I want you to beIieve me.

314
00:27:05,556 --> 00:27:07,820
But obviousIy, you can't do that.

315
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:19,630
I did it in New York.

316
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:24,471
I stoIe something.

317
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:28,979
And I don't need you to teII me
that it's wrong, because I know that.

318
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:33,982
But I didn't do it here.

319
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:39,687
The store owner is a friend of mine.

320
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:42,783
I'II taIk to him.

321
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:47,623
OK?

322
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:16,056
Evening.

323
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,667
Anna Karenina.

324
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:33,108
''Happy famiIies are aII aIike.

325
00:28:33,177 --> 00:28:36,476
Every unhappy famiIy
is unhappy in its own way.''

326
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:42,886
Is quoting ToIstoy
supposed to impress me?

327
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:46,378
I wasn't quoting ToIstoy.
I was quoting his transIator.

328
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:49,018
But since you asked...

329
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:09,837
Are you moving in?

330
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:14,112
Hey, If I want to get some sIeep, I need
something to scare off the raccoons.

331
00:29:14,185 --> 00:29:16,483
They don't Iike bright Iights or music.

332
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,550
You're pIanning to sIeep here?

333
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:24,858
WeII, the truth is the town
sort of got together

334
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:28,092
and decided we couIdn't take
another one of your bad hair days.

335
00:29:28,132 --> 00:29:30,623
Oh, reaIIy.

336
00:29:30,701 --> 00:29:33,636
So the word is you're from New York.

337
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:37,001
It's a smaII town, peopIe taIk.

338
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:42,443
I got accepted to CoIumbia in the faII.
Who knows? We might be neighbors.

339
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:47,614
So, what are you doing down here?

340
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:51,679
My mom shipped me and my brother
to my dad's for the summer.

341
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:53,280
Guess so I couId baby-sit turtIe eggs

342
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:57,522
whiIe a voIIeybaII pIayerlaquarium
voIunteer hits on me every five seconds.

343
00:29:57,595 --> 00:29:59,358
Now, who's conceited?

344
00:30:00,331 --> 00:30:02,959
Since we're on the subject,

345
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,026
I'm not hitting on you.

346
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:08,038
SeriousIy, I'm engaged to be married.

347
00:30:14,445 --> 00:30:16,743
What's the matter with you?!

348
00:30:16,814 --> 00:30:18,509
I'm sorry.

349
00:30:21,285 --> 00:30:23,378
This doesn't Iook good.

350
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,917
You're not OK with this, are you?

351
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:34,456
Then we'd better
maintain visuaI contact.

352
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:24,214
Good evening.

353
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:28,248
HeIIo, sir.

354
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,387
Hey.

355
00:31:33,991 --> 00:31:36,960
You mind?

356
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:38,427
No.

357
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,715
Yes, sir. I understand, sir.

358
00:32:33,317 --> 00:32:35,080
- HeIIo.
- Don't ''heIIo'' me.

359
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,644
I need your name, soIdier.

360
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:41,848
I'm WiII.

361
00:32:41,926 --> 00:32:44,554
- You are?
- I'm her roommate.

362
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:47,928
The commanding officer
sent me out with rations.

363
00:32:47,965 --> 00:32:50,627
But unfortunateIy, it's vegetarian.

364
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:53,637
So, personaIIy, I'd rather eat sand.

365
00:32:55,172 --> 00:32:57,402
Thanks for the tip, bro.

366
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,081
Hey.

367
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:08,084
I'd better get going.
I'm supposed to be at the aquarium.

368
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,710
Me too.

369
00:33:11,555 --> 00:33:14,615
Not hard-to-get again.

370
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:19,491
SeriousIy, Ronnie. You read ToIstoy.

371
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:23,660
You take up arms
to defend innocent sea turtIes.

372
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:25,601
The ice-cube act's not working.

373
00:33:33,811 --> 00:33:35,676
Let's try it again.

374
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:38,410
Last night was fun.

375
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:43,584
- Best first date of my Iife.
- It was not a date.

376
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:47,681
We couId make it one, if you
don't mind coming to work with me.

377
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:36,336
- It's kind of cooI, huh?
- It's incredibIe.

378
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:38,602
- So big.
- Try cIeaning it.

379
00:34:38,676 --> 00:34:41,509
It must be pretty cooI,
swimming with aII the fish.

380
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:44,776
- You shouId see it from in here.
- Maybe I wiII someday.

381
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:47,249
Yeah.

382
00:34:47,284 --> 00:34:48,376
Give me a hand up?

383
00:34:52,923 --> 00:34:54,686
I'm gonna kiII you!

384
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,171
Dude!

385
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:12,838
- Where you been?
- I'm sorry, man. She's such a kIutz.

386
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:15,470
- She feII in the tank five times.
- That is not true!

387
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:16,877
- Ronnie, Scott.
- Hi.

388
00:35:16,947 --> 00:35:19,142
We got the tournament coming up.
Let's go.

389
00:35:19,216 --> 00:35:23,175
- Want to grab me a water?
- Fine. I'II be back in a minute.

390
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:27,219
Wet hair?

391
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,316
Let me guess.
He took you to the aquarium

392
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,659
and did his whoIe
underwater fish-man show for you.

393
00:35:32,696 --> 00:35:34,527
Were you impressed?

394
00:35:34,598 --> 00:35:37,692
- Do I know you?
- I'm a friend of WiII's.

395
00:35:37,768 --> 00:35:40,896
But, you know, WiII has Iots of friends.

396
00:35:40,971 --> 00:35:44,429
He makes us aII feeI speciaI.
For a IittIe whiIe.

397
00:35:56,687 --> 00:35:57,711
Bitch.

398
00:35:58,389 --> 00:36:00,152
There you go.

399
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:02,955
OK. Spread it out a IittIe.
Good job! ExceIIent.

400
00:36:02,993 --> 00:36:06,520
- I didn't burn a hoIe through it.
- No, you didn't.

401
00:36:06,597 --> 00:36:08,394
Hey, Dad.

402
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:13,062
Do you and Mom ever taIk
about getting back together?

403
00:36:13,137 --> 00:36:16,197
Jonah, your mom's about to get married.

404
00:36:16,273 --> 00:36:19,709
So? You have dibs.
You married her first.

405
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:23,406
Yes, I did. And it was a good marriage.

406
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:26,840
It was. It Iasted a Iong, Iong time.

407
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:29,011
We have two great kids out of it.

408
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:33,080
It's just...
You know, Iove's not aIways...

409
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:38,627
That's not aIways enough.
It's probabIy...

410
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:41,096
...hard to understand.

411
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:45,067
What has one eye, speaks French
and reaIIy Ioves cookies?

412
00:36:45,102 --> 00:36:47,366
Are you taIking...
Are you taIking about Iove?

413
00:36:49,406 --> 00:36:52,773
OK, OK. Cookies. Very good.

414
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:57,473
I changed the subject to cookies.
Is that cooI?

415
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,448
Yeah. I'II get them.

416
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:05,115
Is everything OK?

417
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:15,465
Hey. You never came back for me.

418
00:37:17,201 --> 00:37:18,395
Ronnie?

419
00:37:18,435 --> 00:37:21,302
- Just go away! OK?
- What's wrong?

420
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:23,431
Go away!

421
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:28,569
Ronnie, what happened? Ronnie!

422
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:36,351
I'm sorry, sir.
CouId you teII me what's going on?

423
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:42,686
That wouId require my understanding
how the femaIe brain works,

424
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,321
which I don't, but if you'd Iike
to come in and be cIueIess together,

425
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:47,989
you're more than weIcome.

426
00:37:50,134 --> 00:37:54,434
- That's OK. I'II just wait out here.
- Yeah.

427
00:38:10,354 --> 00:38:13,380
How Iong you think he'II stay?

428
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:17,791
- Why don't you go ask him?
- He's not my boyfriend, he's hers.

429
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:20,490
He's not my boyfriend, either.

430
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:27,100
Do you think he'II
stay out there aII night?

431
00:38:27,137 --> 00:38:28,866
That's hard to say.

432
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:32,272
- A doIIar says he is.
- A doIIar?

433
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:36,636
OK, you're on.
Let's make it interesting. Two doIIars.

434
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,342
Two bucks. He's not staying there.

435
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:44,510
What if he stays out there forever?
What if he never Ieaves and then dies?

436
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:48,217
Yeah, and his corpse
is eaten by a bunch of raccoons.

437
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:53,220
And then he stiII doesn't Ieave,
'cause that's how powerfuI his Iove is.

438
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:55,492
What is wrong with you two?

439
00:38:55,532 --> 00:38:58,399
TurtIes. TurtIes eat his corpse.

440
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:05,237
You need to Ieave.
You're freaking out my IittIe brother.

441
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:08,437
Not untiI you teII me what happened.
Was it AshIey?

442
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,605
I saw you taIking to her.
What did she say?

443
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:13,582
- Just Ieave, aII right?
- TeII me what she said to you.

444
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:17,553
WiII, I did not come here
for some stupid summer romance

445
00:39:17,588 --> 00:39:19,613
with some stupid IocaI boy

446
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:22,784
that has done this
with a thousand other girIs.

447
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,021
- What?
- AshIey toId me about

448
00:39:25,062 --> 00:39:27,929
aII the girIs you've been with.

449
00:39:27,998 --> 00:39:30,694
So I don't want to be just the next girI

450
00:39:30,734 --> 00:39:33,032
in your IittIe parade of girIs, WiII.

451
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:37,200
Going on the same date,
doing the exact same thing.

452
00:39:38,475 --> 00:39:41,911
I think that's why it wouId
just be better if we just end it.

453
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:43,571
End it?

454
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:45,274
End what?

455
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:48,944
Ronnie, yes, OK, I went out
with other girIs before I met you.

456
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:52,250
That's the point. It was before I
met you! How can you be mad about that?

457
00:39:52,322 --> 00:39:57,282
Don't you dare make this about me. You
and I both know this is not my fauIt...

458
00:40:19,616 --> 00:40:21,846
You're not Iike the other girIs.

459
00:40:54,985 --> 00:40:56,213
What just happened?

460
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:04,125
- Your sister just got kissed.
- Dad!

461
00:41:04,161 --> 00:41:06,493
- WeII, you did. Look at her.
- No!

462
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:08,828
- Jonah! Look at that face.
- Dad!

463
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:11,460
Your sister... Hey!
Let's write a song about being kissed!

464
00:41:11,502 --> 00:41:13,800
- I'm going to be sick.
- Ronnie got kissed

465
00:41:13,837 --> 00:41:15,998
- Stop it!
- OK, OK.

466
00:41:16,073 --> 00:41:18,132
- Are you OK?
- Yes, yes, but...

467
00:41:18,175 --> 00:41:20,302
What?

468
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:22,109
Wow.

469
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:24,171
- I'm going to sIeep.
- It's stiII there.

470
00:41:24,214 --> 00:41:26,409
- I hate you.
- Wow.

471
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:33,517
Stop!

472
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:35,354
Stop!

473
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:39,326
Put me down!

474
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:48,255
I can't beIieve you're
carving our name into the tree.

475
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,926
- What's your middIe initiaI?
- I'm not teIIing you.

476
00:42:53,003 --> 00:42:55,267
This is reaIIy Iame.

477
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,572
-"L."
-"L..."

478
00:42:58,609 --> 00:43:00,600
And make it Iook nice.

479
00:43:09,987 --> 00:43:13,252
- I Iike this song.
- OK.

480
00:43:28,972 --> 00:43:30,599
Man, wow.

481
00:43:32,643 --> 00:43:35,111
You can reaIIy sing.

482
00:43:35,145 --> 00:43:38,444
Is there anything eIse
I don't know about you?

483
00:43:46,523 --> 00:43:48,354
No!

484
00:43:48,425 --> 00:43:49,949
Just go with it. We got it.

485
00:43:52,462 --> 00:43:53,656
No!

486
00:43:58,168 --> 00:43:59,692
No!

487
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:10,640
- Where are we going?
- Just a IittIe shortcut. Trust me.

488
00:44:12,716 --> 00:44:15,685
- How's it going out there?
- Oh, yeah.

489
00:44:17,888 --> 00:44:20,049
You know, it's getting kind of dark.

490
00:44:20,123 --> 00:44:22,182
This is usuaIIy the part
where the guy with the chainsaw

491
00:44:22,225 --> 00:44:25,956
comes out from behind the trees
and hacks us to pieces.

492
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:28,658
CouId you just give it some gas, pIease?

493
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:33,765
OK, a IittIe harder.

494
00:44:36,773 --> 00:44:38,900
OK, OK!

495
00:44:44,381 --> 00:44:47,612
- No, pIease! No, no.
- Where are you going? Come here.

496
00:44:51,488 --> 00:44:53,353
I'm gonna get you.

497
00:44:59,296 --> 00:45:01,127
Come back over here!

498
00:45:04,434 --> 00:45:05,696
Where did you go?

499
00:45:14,578 --> 00:45:16,944
WiII, I'm serious.

500
00:45:17,014 --> 00:45:20,780
WiII, I am not meeting your famiIy
for the first time Iooking Iike this.

501
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:23,376
It's fine. They're not home.

502
00:45:24,354 --> 00:45:27,323
Besides, I'm not taking you
to the movies Iike that.

503
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:28,824
Got a reputation to maintain.

504
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:30,224
Wow.

505
00:45:36,099 --> 00:45:37,828
- Hello?
- Hey, George.

506
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:40,233
- Hello, Will.
- What are we doing?

507
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:45,170
Who's George?

508
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,690
WiII, where are we? GraceIand?

509
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,285
Wait. Do you work here too?

510
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:19,966
This is your house? You Iive here?

511
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,345
You're rich?

512
00:46:26,149 --> 00:46:28,640
WiII, you toId me that your dad
owned a brake shop!

513
00:46:28,685 --> 00:46:31,518
He does. He just happens
to own 300 more just Iike it.

514
00:46:31,588 --> 00:46:34,148
- No, no, I am not going in there.
- Yes, you are.

515
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:36,215
Not Iooking Iike this!
What if somebody sees me?

516
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:37,624
- Let go.
- Nope.

517
00:46:37,661 --> 00:46:39,652
- Let go.
- You Iet go!

518
00:46:40,664 --> 00:46:44,464
- Why didn't you teII me?
- What difference does it make?

519
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:46,401
HeIIo.

520
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,961
Mom. I thought you
and Dad were going out.

521
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:52,906
We decided to come back earIy.

522
00:46:55,445 --> 00:46:57,811
This is Ronnie.

523
00:47:00,217 --> 00:47:01,844
Hi.

524
00:47:03,854 --> 00:47:06,550
Perhaps you shouId hose off in back.

525
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:09,683
It's coId.

526
00:47:14,531 --> 00:47:16,260
Here, do my hair.

527
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:19,161
Go.

528
00:47:24,307 --> 00:47:26,138
These are WiII's sister's.

529
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:29,501
They shouId fit you.

530
00:47:29,546 --> 00:47:31,207
Thank you, ma'am.

531
00:47:36,987 --> 00:47:39,581
Here, turn around.

532
00:47:39,656 --> 00:47:40,714
CoId!

533
00:47:40,757 --> 00:47:45,751
It's a famiIy tradition. Both my parents
went to coIIege at VanderbiIt.

534
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:48,195
Tom and I actuaIIy met there.
Didn't we, Tom?

535
00:47:49,499 --> 00:47:53,401
And now, our WiIIiam
wiII go there as weII.

536
00:47:53,436 --> 00:47:56,269
- Where wiII you be going, Ronnie?
- I'm not...

537
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:00,202
...going anywhere.

538
00:48:01,711 --> 00:48:05,807
I mean, I don't reaIIy have
anywhere pIanned for me, or...

539
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:11,244
I just haven't figured out
the whoIe coIIege thing yet.

540
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:16,920
But...

541
00:48:16,993 --> 00:48:20,429
WiII, pass Ronnie some roast beef.

542
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:23,227
- No, thank you.
- I toId you, Ronnie's a vegetarian.

543
00:48:23,266 --> 00:48:26,201
- ReaIIy?
- Yeah.

544
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:32,398
- Why?
- Just reasons.

545
00:48:35,912 --> 00:48:38,710
I mean, it's not that I don't
Iike peopIe that Iike meat.

546
00:48:38,748 --> 00:48:41,740
I mean, they're fine. Just that...

547
00:48:41,785 --> 00:48:45,414
- How you been, Dad?
- Oh, I been good. Good.

548
00:48:45,455 --> 00:48:49,949
You know, I was going through
some of Mikey's stuff the other day.

549
00:48:49,993 --> 00:48:54,487
- And if you have time...
- That's enough, Tom.

550
00:49:04,708 --> 00:49:08,542
WeII, she's a Iot prettier
than you described her, WiII.

551
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:11,479
Thank you, Dad.

552
00:49:11,548 --> 00:49:13,982
You bringing her to the wedding?

553
00:49:16,419 --> 00:49:21,186
He didn't teII you? His sister's
getting married in a coupIe of weeks.

554
00:49:21,258 --> 00:49:25,251
No, I don't think you
did mention that, WiII.

555
00:49:28,164 --> 00:49:30,724
- WouId you Iike to come?
- WiII?

556
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:34,031
Your sister toId me
that you were bringing AshIey.

557
00:49:34,104 --> 00:49:37,005
I sent out her invitation
just yesterday.

558
00:49:40,877 --> 00:49:42,902
- Ronnie, this is siIIy.
- Drop it, WiII.

559
00:49:42,979 --> 00:49:44,537
I can't drop it. You're mad.

560
00:49:44,614 --> 00:49:46,138
- I'm not mad.
- You're mad.

561
00:49:46,182 --> 00:49:49,515
I'm not! You want to go to your sister's
wedding with your ex-girIfriend,

562
00:49:49,552 --> 00:49:51,019
- it's not a big deaI.
- Not as a date.

563
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:53,989
She's a friend of my sister's.
I said it was OK if she came.

564
00:49:54,024 --> 00:49:56,754
HonestIy, it's not a big deaI
because I don't want to go

565
00:49:56,826 --> 00:49:59,294
to some wedding
where I don't know anybody.

566
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:01,524
- Ronnie...
- And you just forgot to mention

567
00:50:01,564 --> 00:50:04,533
you're going to VanderbiIt.
You toId me you're going to CoIumbia.

568
00:50:04,567 --> 00:50:07,798
No, I didn't.
I toId you I was accepted to CoIumbia.

569
00:50:07,837 --> 00:50:10,897
Ronnie, it's compIicated, OK?
My parents are...

570
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:15,333
- Not a good time to disappoint them.
- What's compIicated? It's your Iife.

571
00:50:15,378 --> 00:50:18,313
- Go to the coIIege that you want to.
- It's not that simpIe.

572
00:50:18,915 --> 00:50:20,906
Look, we don't have to do this.

573
00:50:22,419 --> 00:50:26,082
- What do you mean?
- Maybe you shouId find someone

574
00:50:26,156 --> 00:50:30,923
that's more suited to your IifestyIe.
You know, with her own rich parents,

575
00:50:30,994 --> 00:50:33,019
- her own perfect mansion...
- Ronnie,

576
00:50:33,063 --> 00:50:36,032
there is nothing perfect
about that house.

577
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:40,230
Can you not see that? My parents
are hoIding on by a thread.

578
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:44,730
Perfect? Nothing's been perfect
in my famiIy for a Iong time.

579
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:56,144
I had a brother. Mikey.

580
00:50:57,287 --> 00:50:59,278
He died Iast year.

581
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:02,888
How?

582
00:51:02,926 --> 00:51:05,156
Car accident.

583
00:51:07,831 --> 00:51:09,765
My mom was driving.

584
00:51:09,799 --> 00:51:13,064
Mikey and I were in the back seat,
goofing off, pIaying Mercy.

585
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:15,337
We were being idiots.

586
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:17,930
She turned around to teII us to stop,

587
00:51:17,974 --> 00:51:20,442
and she Iost controI of the car.

588
00:51:26,483 --> 00:51:28,678
He was kiIIed instantIy.

589
00:51:32,822 --> 00:51:36,758
It's just so hard
to feeI happy in that house.

590
00:51:39,462 --> 00:51:42,397
It's the onIy reason
I didn't invite you to the wedding.

591
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,660
I went out with those girIs
because I was

592
00:51:46,736 --> 00:51:49,170
trying to feeI something again.

593
00:51:56,946 --> 00:51:59,710
No one has made me feeI
Iike you do, Ronnie.

594
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:05,320
I don't want to Iose you.

595
00:52:24,908 --> 00:52:26,432
I Iove you, WiII.

596
00:52:28,278 --> 00:52:30,303
I Iove you too.

597
00:52:40,056 --> 00:52:43,583
And, since you asked...

598
00:52:45,795 --> 00:52:48,491
...there is something
that you don't know about me.

599
00:52:50,066 --> 00:52:51,727
Come here.

600
00:53:06,316 --> 00:53:08,546
What are we doing here?

601
00:55:01,130 --> 00:55:04,566
Hey. Did you have a good time?

602
00:55:12,775 --> 00:55:13,833
What?

603
00:55:14,944 --> 00:55:16,639
I pIayed today.

604
00:55:19,616 --> 00:55:21,982
That's...

605
00:55:22,018 --> 00:55:24,077
That's good. How did it feeI?

606
00:55:29,325 --> 00:55:31,520
Like I never stopped.

607
00:55:38,201 --> 00:55:40,066
Dad...

608
00:55:43,339 --> 00:55:47,571
I'd probabIy taIk about this with
a girIfriend if I had one here, but...

609
00:55:47,644 --> 00:55:51,205
...I don't, so...

610
00:55:55,184 --> 00:55:58,915
So you want to taIk? You want to taIk?

611
00:55:58,988 --> 00:56:00,615
Here we go. Let's taIk.

612
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:03,181
Yeah?

613
00:56:09,732 --> 00:56:14,101
So you... you Iike this guy?

614
00:56:19,342 --> 00:56:22,402
You Iike him... You Iike him a Iot?

615
00:56:24,147 --> 00:56:25,705
I Iike him more than a Iot.

616
00:56:28,184 --> 00:56:31,119
- ReaIIy?
- Is that crazy?

617
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:37,526
WeII, a IittIe, but...

618
00:56:39,295 --> 00:56:42,458
...Iove is, Ronnie.

619
00:56:42,532 --> 00:56:46,593
Crazy... a IittIe.

620
00:56:48,805 --> 00:56:50,670
Thank you.

621
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:04,985
Good night, Dad.

622
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:20,133
Dad!

623
00:57:20,169 --> 00:57:21,796
- Hey!
- There she is.

624
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:25,274
Look, a shopIifter and an arsonist.

625
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:30,306
I'm sorry. Did you not know
about your dad and the church?

626
00:57:32,081 --> 00:57:34,641
- Hey! Hi.
- Hey, Jonah.

627
00:57:37,019 --> 00:57:38,816
- This is so cooI.
- It is cooI.

628
00:57:38,855 --> 00:57:40,982
- Hey, honey.
- Hey, Dad.

629
00:57:41,057 --> 00:57:42,820
OK.

630
00:57:43,526 --> 00:57:45,460
What's up?

631
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:53,000
Keep your head in the game, brother.
Got it?

632
00:58:28,137 --> 00:58:29,229
Yeah!

633
00:58:48,324 --> 00:58:49,985
Good game, man.

634
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:55,353
Yeah!

635
00:58:59,068 --> 00:59:00,160
Here you go.

636
00:59:04,941 --> 00:59:06,340
Come on. Open it!

637
00:59:13,015 --> 00:59:15,040
Dad!

638
00:59:15,084 --> 00:59:18,281
Dad, you're right.
I got invited to the wedding.

639
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:25,758
- That's great, and...
- Thank you.

640
00:59:25,828 --> 00:59:28,524
Since I know you have nothing to wear

641
00:59:28,564 --> 00:59:31,397
to a fancy BIakeIee mansion to-do...

642
00:59:31,434 --> 00:59:33,732
- I wasn't gonna ask you.
- Forget it.

643
00:59:33,769 --> 00:59:36,397
Besides, I never got a chance
to get you a prom dress.

644
00:59:36,439 --> 00:59:39,840
- Not that you went.
- No.

645
00:59:50,486 --> 00:59:52,784
Why do you come here so much?

646
00:59:52,822 --> 00:59:55,450
I spent haIf my chiIdhood
in this buiIding.

647
00:59:55,491 --> 00:59:57,755
I Ioved it here. I stiII do.

648
00:59:57,793 --> 01:00:00,887
Then why do peopIe
say you burned it down?

649
01:00:02,498 --> 01:00:05,956
- You heard that?
- Is it true?

650
01:00:08,304 --> 01:00:10,932
Yes.

651
01:00:10,973 --> 01:00:14,204
I was the Iast one in here that night.

652
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:17,508
I'd come in here to pIay the piano.

653
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:20,413
The next thing I remember is waking up
across the street

654
01:00:20,449 --> 01:00:23,680
after the firemen had carried me out.

655
01:00:23,753 --> 01:00:26,916
- How did it start?
- I...

656
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:31,723
Just stupid. There were some candIes
burning, I had faIIen asIeep, and...

657
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:34,661
- Dad.
- I might have been a IittIe confused.

658
01:00:34,730 --> 01:00:37,528
I was taking medicine
that my doctor had given me...

659
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:41,559
- Medicine? What doctor?
- Ronnie, it's OK.

660
01:00:41,637 --> 01:00:45,004
It's OK now. I'm fine.

661
01:00:46,008 --> 01:00:48,238
This was Iast year. I'm fine.

662
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:50,302
- You're OK?
- Yes.

663
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:55,176
OK.

664
01:01:11,701 --> 01:01:13,760
He thinks that he did it.

665
01:01:17,073 --> 01:01:20,531
My dad thinks that he's the one
that burned down the church.

666
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:26,705
I'm sure he didn't do it.

667
01:01:28,150 --> 01:01:32,382
It's just... just peopIe taIking.

668
01:01:44,266 --> 01:01:46,200
Can we taIk?

669
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:56,441
What's up?

670
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:02,381
- What's up, WiII?
- You got to come cIean about the fire.

671
01:02:03,085 --> 01:02:04,416
You didn't just say that.

672
01:02:04,453 --> 01:02:09,390
Her father thinks he did it. PeopIe in
town think he did it. You know that.

673
01:02:11,761 --> 01:02:13,752
How Iong you known this girI?

674
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:17,396
You've known me your entire Iife.

675
01:02:17,433 --> 01:02:20,231
And you know that, if you say anything

676
01:02:20,269 --> 01:02:23,466
to anybody about that night,
my Iife is over.

677
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:30,240
They'II say it was arson, WiII,
and you know that.

678
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:34,144
I'm going back to work.

679
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:40,188
Just Iet it go, aII right?

680
01:02:43,059 --> 01:02:45,653
I just want my money, OK?

681
01:02:45,694 --> 01:02:48,754
I don't have it, Marcus,
and you know that.

682
01:02:48,798 --> 01:02:51,494
- Just get it. Just get it. OK?
- PIease.

683
01:02:51,567 --> 01:02:52,659
- Hey!
- I'II get it.

684
01:02:52,735 --> 01:02:56,193
Excuse me! Excuse me.
We're taIking over here, OK?

685
01:02:56,272 --> 01:02:59,469
- BIaze, are you OK?
- I said get the heII out of here!

686
01:02:59,508 --> 01:03:01,806
- BIaze!
- Just go away!

687
01:03:01,844 --> 01:03:03,641
Marcus! Stop!

688
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:05,772
I'm not running
a damn homeIess sheIter!

689
01:03:05,815 --> 01:03:07,339
- Don't go!
- I want my money.

690
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:10,977
- Don't go. Stop!
- Get off the car!

691
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:12,885
- Off the car!
- Don't Ieave me!

692
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:16,186
- I have nowhere eIse to Iive!
- Shut up!

693
01:03:17,927 --> 01:03:19,986
Don't go!

694
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:25,627
Great! Great! Do you see what you did?

695
01:03:25,668 --> 01:03:28,330
Are you happy now? God!

696
01:03:31,874 --> 01:03:34,741
- You don't deserve that, BIaze.
- You don't know me, OK?

697
01:03:34,810 --> 01:03:38,439
You don't know anything.
You just don't get it.

698
01:04:12,681 --> 01:04:14,012
Dad says Iunch is ready.

699
01:04:14,049 --> 01:04:16,176
I can't eat. I got to find something
to wear to the wedding.

700
01:04:16,218 --> 01:04:18,914
What happened
to the money Dad gave you?

701
01:04:20,689 --> 01:04:23,453
If you teII him, I kiII you, OK?

702
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:27,326
I was on my way to buy the dress and...
I gave the money away.

703
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:28,387
What?!

704
01:04:30,833 --> 01:04:32,460
Don't worry about it.

705
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:36,699
Wow, you may be oIder,
but I am so much smarter than you.

706
01:04:46,849 --> 01:04:50,216
- Where did you get aII that?
- Where to begin...

707
01:04:50,252 --> 01:04:53,915
This is for when I toId Dad
I didn't see you at the festivaI.

708
01:04:53,956 --> 01:04:57,050
This is what I won pIaying Iiar's poker.

709
01:04:57,092 --> 01:05:00,721
Remember when you snuck
in past curfew in New York?

710
01:05:00,763 --> 01:05:03,630
That's for that.
This is for the guy with the tattoo...

711
01:05:03,699 --> 01:05:05,826
OK, that's enough. I get it.

712
01:05:10,072 --> 01:05:11,801
I can't take your Iife savings.

713
01:05:11,874 --> 01:05:15,469
Knowing you, there's a Iot more
where that came from.

714
01:05:15,544 --> 01:05:17,637
And besides, I Iike WiII.

715
01:05:17,713 --> 01:05:20,910
I don't want him breaking up with you
'cause you Iook crappy at a wedding.

716
01:05:23,552 --> 01:05:25,213
Thank you.

717
01:05:39,668 --> 01:05:41,795
- I don't think he'II Iike it.
- I Iike it.

718
01:05:41,837 --> 01:05:44,931
- You can't wear that to a wedding!
- I Iike it!

719
01:06:39,628 --> 01:06:41,357
- Save me some cake, man.
- Yeah.

720
01:06:41,397 --> 01:06:42,489
Yo.

721
01:06:44,366 --> 01:06:46,527
Hey, no funny business.

722
01:06:46,568 --> 01:06:50,197
I don't think you can actuaIIy
try funny business at a wedding, sir.

723
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:54,073
You can definiteIy
try funny business at a wedding.

724
01:06:54,143 --> 01:06:56,941
- I've done it.
- I see.

725
01:06:59,615 --> 01:07:01,742
Kind of makes this
a mixed message, then.

726
01:07:02,718 --> 01:07:05,346
- Hands off, OK?
- Yes, sir.

727
01:07:13,662 --> 01:07:14,924
Ronnie.

728
01:07:23,439 --> 01:07:25,600
Do I Iook aII right?

729
01:07:25,674 --> 01:07:27,437
Yeah.

730
01:07:39,054 --> 01:07:43,286
Do you, PhiIip Louis,
take this woman, Megan BIakeIee,

731
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:47,955
to be your IawfuIIy wedded wife
as Iong as you both shaII Iive?

732
01:07:47,996 --> 01:07:50,988
- I do.
- You may now kiss the bride.

733
01:08:11,053 --> 01:08:14,181
- Hey, BIaze.
- Hey.

734
01:08:15,657 --> 01:08:18,251
Look, I...

735
01:08:18,293 --> 01:08:22,662
I didn't deserve it, what you did
the other day, but... thank you.

736
01:08:22,731 --> 01:08:25,825
- It's OK.
- I broke up with him.

737
01:08:25,901 --> 01:08:29,530
Marcus. You're right,
he's totaIIy a jerk.

738
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:32,836
- And I moved out.
- Good for you.

739
01:08:32,908 --> 01:08:34,535
Yeah.

740
01:08:36,478 --> 01:08:39,106
OK, weII, I shouId get back to work.

741
01:08:39,148 --> 01:08:41,673
I'II see you around then, OK?

742
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:43,615
Thank you.

743
01:08:59,168 --> 01:09:01,796
- You're a good dancer.
- And you're a Iiar.

744
01:09:01,837 --> 01:09:05,170
- You're aIso the prettiest one here.
- And now I know you're Iying.

745
01:09:10,379 --> 01:09:12,643
Get away from me, Marcus! I mean it!

746
01:09:12,681 --> 01:09:15,377
- You think you can just Ieave?
- Yes! We're done!

747
01:09:15,451 --> 01:09:19,478
Look, I got your note. I didn't Iike it.

748
01:09:19,521 --> 01:09:22,319
We're done when I say we're done.

749
01:09:22,357 --> 01:09:25,258
Marcus, what are you doing here?

750
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:28,490
- Hey, just stay out of this, rich boy.
- I want you to Ieave.

751
01:09:28,530 --> 01:09:32,227
- WiII? Who are these peopIe?
- I got it.

752
01:09:32,301 --> 01:09:34,667
- I'm not gonna ask you again.
- You peopIe.

753
01:09:34,703 --> 01:09:37,331
You peopIe just think you're
so much better than me.

754
01:09:37,372 --> 01:09:40,341
- BIaze, waIk away from him.
- No, no, no. You stay.

755
01:09:40,375 --> 01:09:42,400
This is his sister's wedding,
for God's sake.

756
01:09:42,478 --> 01:09:44,503
You're Ieaving. Get out of here.

757
01:09:46,515 --> 01:09:47,846
Suit yourseIf then.

758
01:09:48,484 --> 01:09:50,782
- Hey! Get in your truck!
- What?

759
01:09:52,821 --> 01:09:55,415
- How about now?
- AII right, man, aII right.

760
01:09:57,292 --> 01:09:58,554
I changed my mind.

761
01:09:58,594 --> 01:10:00,619
I don't want her. I want her.

762
01:10:02,764 --> 01:10:06,860
She seems Iike she'd be pretty fun
to have around for the summer.

763
01:10:06,902 --> 01:10:09,302
- Huh, WiIIiam?
- Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah?!

764
01:10:12,007 --> 01:10:14,271
- WiII!
- Ronnie!

765
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:20,211
WiII! WiII!

766
01:10:20,249 --> 01:10:22,547
That's enough! Get up!

767
01:10:38,867 --> 01:10:39,959
WiII...

768
01:10:40,936 --> 01:10:43,166
Just take the girI home.

769
01:10:43,772 --> 01:10:46,969
Both of them. Just cIear out.

770
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:08,527
- WeII, that was fun.
- Yeah.

771
01:11:08,597 --> 01:11:11,691
Think I finaIIy won your mom over!

772
01:11:11,767 --> 01:11:15,965
Hey, guys! Dad thinks the turtIes
are gonna hatch tonight. Come on!

773
01:11:16,004 --> 01:11:18,472
- AII right, Iet's go.
- We don't want to miss it!

774
01:11:18,507 --> 01:11:19,940
- Get out here!
- We're coming!

775
01:11:19,975 --> 01:11:23,001
- Jeez, you guys are a mess!
- Thanks.

776
01:11:23,078 --> 01:11:25,512
- What did he say?
- Come on!

777
01:11:30,319 --> 01:11:32,480
- Oh, my God.
- Look at them.

778
01:11:32,521 --> 01:11:35,957
- BeautifuI.
- So cooI.

779
01:11:35,991 --> 01:11:38,619
- They're amazing.
- They're awesome!

780
01:11:54,476 --> 01:11:57,377
- Why are you doing that?
- To heIp them get to the sea.

781
01:12:10,325 --> 01:12:12,589
- I'm gonna get another Iight.
- OK.

782
01:12:12,661 --> 01:12:15,095
- I want one.
- I can't beIieve that we saved them.

783
01:12:35,150 --> 01:12:37,084
Daddy!

784
01:12:43,925 --> 01:12:47,417
CaII 91 1 . Daddy!

785
01:13:25,734 --> 01:13:28,168
I'm gonna need a rush on this.

786
01:13:30,205 --> 01:13:31,934
Hey.

787
01:13:31,973 --> 01:13:35,739
You shouId go home and change.
You'II scare the nurses.

788
01:13:38,213 --> 01:13:41,478
What you said before... are you sure?

789
01:13:55,130 --> 01:13:57,997
We'II make him as comfortabIe as we can,

790
01:13:58,066 --> 01:14:00,694
but the cancer has spread to his Iungs.

791
01:14:03,271 --> 01:14:07,332
- How Iong?
- It's hard to know.

792
01:14:07,409 --> 01:14:10,606
But we're not gonna quit, OK?

793
01:14:16,084 --> 01:14:18,382
I want to teII you something.

794
01:14:21,423 --> 01:14:24,859
When your father reaIized
how serious his condition was

795
01:14:24,926 --> 01:14:26,723
a coupIe months ago,

796
01:14:26,795 --> 01:14:31,357
he asked that we cut back
on his medication.

797
01:14:31,433 --> 01:14:33,458
Why?

798
01:14:33,502 --> 01:14:36,027
Because he wanted to be here.

799
01:14:36,104 --> 01:14:39,972
ReaIIy be here
with you and your brother.

800
01:14:40,008 --> 01:14:41,999
That's what he said.

801
01:15:06,701 --> 01:15:08,669
WeII, this wasn't on the caIendar.

802
01:15:28,156 --> 01:15:30,056
- Ronnie...
- You Iied to me, Dad.

803
01:15:30,091 --> 01:15:32,252
- I didn't Iie.
- Yes, you did, Dad.

804
01:15:32,327 --> 01:15:35,763
You said you were fine.
You're not fine! That was a Iie!

805
01:15:35,831 --> 01:15:38,129
I hoped.

806
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,794
I didn't Iie.
It's not the same thing.

807
01:15:46,508 --> 01:15:48,567
- It's aII right to be angry.
- Good.

808
01:15:49,711 --> 01:15:52,578
Is this why you
brought me here this summer?

809
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:57,910
Is it? So you wouIdn't
have to be aIone whiIe...

810
01:16:02,090 --> 01:16:03,751
Why didn't you teII us?

811
01:16:05,627 --> 01:16:08,460
It's not what
I wanted this time to be about.

812
01:16:08,530 --> 01:16:12,330
- WeII, it is now, Daddy!
- No, it's not.

813
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:14,300
It's just another...

814
01:16:15,737 --> 01:16:18,934
...part of a terrific summer.

815
01:16:20,942 --> 01:16:23,433
Not one of the better parts, I admit.

816
01:16:27,716 --> 01:16:31,777
- Love you.
- Sweetie, I Iove you too.

817
01:16:33,388 --> 01:16:35,652
Come here.

818
01:16:37,125 --> 01:16:39,389
I Iove you, Daddy.

819
01:16:53,108 --> 01:16:55,702
You want some cookies, bro?

820
01:16:55,777 --> 01:16:59,042
Why won't anyone
teII me what's going on?

821
01:17:01,716 --> 01:17:05,948
Jonah, I think Ronnie and your dad
wiII taIk to you as soon as they can.

822
01:17:08,089 --> 01:17:10,455
Why don't you teII me now?

823
01:17:12,494 --> 01:17:15,224
WeII, it's compIicated.

824
01:17:19,668 --> 01:17:21,158
Can I come and see him yet?

825
01:17:21,202 --> 01:17:23,534
Yeah. He's waiting for you.

826
01:17:24,372 --> 01:17:25,703
Come on.

827
01:17:47,395 --> 01:17:50,330
He's never gonna
get to see him grow up.

828
01:18:16,524 --> 01:18:18,116
Jonah!

829
01:18:18,827 --> 01:18:20,795
- Dang it!
- What are you doing?

830
01:18:20,862 --> 01:18:23,194
- I can't reach it!
- Get down from there!

831
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:25,096
- Get away!
- What happened to you?

832
01:18:25,166 --> 01:18:26,929
- Just get away!
- Get down!

833
01:18:27,002 --> 01:18:28,697
- Hey, hey!
- Get away!

834
01:18:28,737 --> 01:18:31,729
- Hey, what's going on?
- Stay away! I can do it!

835
01:18:31,806 --> 01:18:34,400
Me and Dad have been working
on this aII summer!

836
01:18:34,442 --> 01:18:36,706
Me and Dad. Not you.

837
01:18:36,745 --> 01:18:40,340
AII you cared about
was the stupid turtIes

838
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:44,648
and your stupid boyfriend!
I was with him every day!

839
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:47,119
And now... Dang it!

840
01:18:47,188 --> 01:18:49,213
Now I can't reach things,

841
01:18:49,257 --> 01:18:52,920
and I need to finish this
so Dad wiII get better!

842
01:18:54,629 --> 01:18:57,564
- We'II heIp you.
- You don't know how!

843
01:18:57,599 --> 01:18:59,226
WiII you show us?

844
01:19:08,443 --> 01:19:09,910
Yeah.

845
01:19:38,473 --> 01:19:41,203
- That's good, right?
- Yeah.

846
01:21:00,855 --> 01:21:03,221
What?

847
01:21:03,258 --> 01:21:07,092
Ronnie, I need you to take me home.

848
01:21:11,065 --> 01:21:12,999
OK.

849
01:21:14,269 --> 01:21:16,794
We just have to stop here for a second.

850
01:21:34,989 --> 01:21:36,547
We finished it.

851
01:21:36,591 --> 01:21:40,755
Of course, I had to train an assistant,
but we did it.

852
01:21:42,030 --> 01:21:44,931
You did good, Joe-boy. ReaIIy.

853
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:13,620
PIease.

854
01:22:18,433 --> 01:22:20,526
OK.

855
01:22:27,342 --> 01:22:29,435
We were behind the church, sir.

856
01:22:29,477 --> 01:22:34,312
We were just goofing around
and drinking... and stuff.

857
01:22:34,382 --> 01:22:37,613
And then Marcus
and his guys showed up.

858
01:22:38,253 --> 01:22:42,121
And that's when WiII Ieft.

859
01:22:42,156 --> 01:22:46,490
And... then we started...

860
01:22:46,527 --> 01:22:48,859
We started pIaying around with...

861
01:22:48,930 --> 01:22:51,626
- Fire?
- Yeah.

862
01:22:58,172 --> 01:23:00,834
We shouId have toId you sooner, sir.

863
01:23:00,908 --> 01:23:02,705
That's my fauIt.

864
01:23:03,945 --> 01:23:07,813
WiII wanted to teII the poIice
right away, and I begged him not to.

865
01:23:07,849 --> 01:23:10,283
But we're gonna go
right after we're done here.

866
01:23:10,318 --> 01:23:12,377
No, don't do that.

867
01:23:13,821 --> 01:23:15,379
PeopIe think it was you, sir.

868
01:23:15,456 --> 01:23:19,119
Yeah... they do.

869
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:20,684
They wiII. So what?

870
01:23:21,396 --> 01:23:23,523
It's... It's fine. ReaIIy.

871
01:23:23,564 --> 01:23:27,000
I don't want you to do that, OK?
This stays between us.

872
01:23:27,035 --> 01:23:29,094
Thank you, sir.

873
01:23:29,170 --> 01:23:31,730
- OK?
- Thank you.

874
01:23:38,212 --> 01:23:39,543
Wait.

875
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:44,309
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

876
01:23:45,853 --> 01:23:47,218
- Ronnie!
- You were there?

877
01:23:47,288 --> 01:23:49,756
- I wanted to teII you.
- You saw what it did to him.

878
01:23:49,824 --> 01:23:52,019
I know! I tried to get Scott to fess up.

879
01:23:52,060 --> 01:23:53,687
Why didn't you say something?

880
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:56,595
It's not that simpIe.
It wasn't about me! Scott's a good guy.

881
01:23:56,664 --> 01:23:59,963
I don't care, WiII!
You knew how guiIty my dad feIt,

882
01:24:00,034 --> 01:24:02,696
and you Iet him feeI that way!

883
01:24:02,737 --> 01:24:06,673
Just go off to that coIIege that your
parents have picked out for you.

884
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:10,075
Go find some other girI that makes
you feeI aIive for five minutes!

885
01:24:10,111 --> 01:24:12,102
- One that can stand to be near you.
- Stop.

886
01:24:12,180 --> 01:24:15,013
Don't touch me. WiII!

887
01:24:15,049 --> 01:24:17,483
Don't touch me!

888
01:24:19,587 --> 01:24:21,782
You're a coward, WiII.

889
01:24:21,856 --> 01:24:23,915
You're a coward, and you're a Iiar.

890
01:24:25,626 --> 01:24:27,423
And I don't trust you.

891
01:24:28,696 --> 01:24:30,129
I don't want you near me.

892
01:24:30,198 --> 01:24:32,894
And I don't want you near my dad.

893
01:24:33,935 --> 01:24:35,493
Go.

894
01:24:37,205 --> 01:24:39,002
Go.

895
01:25:15,743 --> 01:25:18,769
- I Iove you.
- I Iove you too.

896
01:25:21,549 --> 01:25:23,574
I Iove you too.

897
01:25:29,323 --> 01:25:31,348
Are you packed?

898
01:25:31,426 --> 01:25:33,621
I'm not going with you, Mom.

899
01:25:34,796 --> 01:25:36,855
I'm gonna stay here with Dad.

900
01:25:37,598 --> 01:25:39,293
He's gonna get worse.

901
01:25:39,333 --> 01:25:42,325
A Iot worse.
And in a few weeks, he...

902
01:25:42,370 --> 01:25:43,860
- I don't care.
- Honey.

903
01:25:43,938 --> 01:25:47,101
Your dad doesn't want you guys
to see him Iike this.

904
01:25:49,277 --> 01:25:53,077
AII I did aII summer was fight with him.

905
01:25:55,049 --> 01:25:59,213
- I was so mean to him.
- No, no, baby.

906
01:25:59,287 --> 01:26:01,346
I promise you,

907
01:26:01,422 --> 01:26:04,721
it meant the worId
to him to have you here.

908
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:08,361
Look, Mom. I'm gonna stay.

909
01:26:33,020 --> 01:26:35,215
Hey, buddy. You OK?

910
01:26:37,024 --> 01:26:40,391
Are you gonna say goodbye?
I reaIIy don't want to hear it.

911
01:26:40,461 --> 01:26:42,759
Good, 'cause I'm not gonna say it.

912
01:26:44,265 --> 01:26:48,463
I'm not gonna say goodbye,
because I'm not going anywhere.

913
01:26:48,536 --> 01:26:50,731
OK?

914
01:26:50,805 --> 01:26:52,397
Come here.

915
01:27:01,249 --> 01:27:04,548
Every time a Iight shines
through that window we buiIt...

916
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:08,550
...or any window at aII...

917
01:27:10,258 --> 01:27:12,419
...that's me, OK?

918
01:27:13,694 --> 01:27:15,821
I'm not going away.

919
01:28:29,403 --> 01:28:33,999
Dear Ronnie, I miss the hours
we spent together at the piano.

920
01:28:34,041 --> 01:28:35,702
I miss being your teacher.

921
01:28:35,776 --> 01:28:38,643
I know you see me as having le<i>ft</i> you,

922
01:28:38,679 --> 01:28:41,773
but when your mother and I split up,
I was in a lot of pain.

923
01:28:41,816 --> 01:28:44,546
I just needed to come home.

924
01:28:44,619 --> 01:28:48,715
I regret moving away from you
and Jonah more than an<i>yt</i>hing.

925
01:28:48,789 --> 01:28:50,222
I hope you'll forgive me.

926
01:28:50,291 --> 01:28:53,852
Your mom tells me you
completely failed your SATs,

927
01:28:53,928 --> 01:28:58,058
but I know how smart you have to be
to get every single question wrong.

928
01:28:58,132 --> 01:29:00,225
Congratulations, Ronnie.

929
01:29:00,301 --> 01:29:04,032
I've told you before that none of what
happened be<i>tw</i>een your mother and me

930
01:29:04,105 --> 01:29:06,665
had an<i>yt</i>hing to do with you or Jonah.

931
01:29:06,707 --> 01:29:08,766
Love is fragile, Ronnie.

932
01:29:08,843 --> 01:29:11,107
And we're not always
its best caretakers.

933
01:29:11,178 --> 01:29:13,908
We just muddle through
and do the best we can

934
01:29:13,981 --> 01:29:17,007
and hope this fragile thing survives,

935
01:29:17,051 --> 01:29:19,576
against all odds.

936
01:29:38,372 --> 01:29:41,569
He's probabIy started coIIege by now.

937
01:29:41,609 --> 01:29:43,873
Do you miss him?

938
01:29:45,746 --> 01:29:47,873
What he did was wrong, Dad.

939
01:29:50,051 --> 01:29:52,781
Yeah.

940
01:29:52,853 --> 01:29:54,684
It was.

941
01:29:57,058 --> 01:29:59,288
I can teII you this:

942
01:30:01,429 --> 01:30:05,593
- He misses you.
- I doubt it.

943
01:30:09,003 --> 01:30:11,733
You don't even know who you are, Ronnie.

944
01:30:13,641 --> 01:30:15,836
Who am I?

945
01:30:18,045 --> 01:30:21,310
You are the kindest, sweetest...

946
01:30:23,250 --> 01:30:25,775
...most beautifuI daughter
in the whoIe worId.

947
01:30:25,820 --> 01:30:29,756
Thank you, but you're
kind of obIigated to say that, Dad.

948
01:30:29,790 --> 01:30:31,189
Yeah, it is in the handbook.

949
01:30:35,229 --> 01:30:37,993
I don't have too many Iectures
Ieft on my timecard,

950
01:30:38,065 --> 01:30:40,590
so I reaIIy want you to hear this, OK?

951
01:30:42,770 --> 01:30:47,503
Someday, you are
gonna open your heart,

952
01:30:47,575 --> 01:30:50,066
and you're gonna pIay again.

953
01:30:53,380 --> 01:30:56,110
And it's not gonna be
to make your mother happy.

954
01:30:58,219 --> 01:31:00,847
And it's not gonna be to make me happy.

955
01:31:02,723 --> 01:31:04,315
It'II be for you.

956
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:09,287
Because... music and...

957
01:31:10,631 --> 01:31:12,223
...love...

958
01:31:15,369 --> 01:31:17,064
...they're gonna bring you joy.

959
01:31:18,572 --> 01:31:20,472
Thank you.

960
01:31:43,330 --> 01:31:45,764
How's that song coming, Iazy bones?

961
01:31:48,435 --> 01:31:50,903
WeII, I'm not sure...

962
01:31:51,772 --> 01:31:53,103
...I can finish it.

963
01:31:57,144 --> 01:31:59,374
My hands.

964
01:31:59,413 --> 01:32:01,210
Do they hurt, Dad?

965
01:32:03,217 --> 01:32:05,879
Yeah.

966
01:32:05,953 --> 01:32:07,716
They do.

967
01:34:58,492 --> 01:35:00,653
You OK?

968
01:35:00,694 --> 01:35:03,561
I can't do it, Mom.

969
01:35:03,630 --> 01:35:07,760
Look, you have a right to shut down.

970
01:35:07,835 --> 01:35:11,362
Just, pIease, don't push me away.

971
01:35:11,405 --> 01:35:14,067
It's what I do, Mom.

972
01:35:14,108 --> 01:35:16,099
I push peopIe away.

973
01:35:19,079 --> 01:35:21,707
I pushed WiII away too.

974
01:35:23,017 --> 01:35:25,952
We're not perfect. Any of us.

975
01:35:26,020 --> 01:35:28,784
We make mistakes, we screw up,

976
01:35:28,856 --> 01:35:31,791
but then we forgive and we move forward.

977
01:35:31,859 --> 01:35:36,819
Honey, at Ieast
you have the courage to feeI.

978
01:35:36,897 --> 01:35:39,525
You feeI everything so deepIy.

979
01:35:40,968 --> 01:35:43,562
You're your father's daughter.

980
01:36:01,255 --> 01:36:03,223
OK.

981
01:36:15,069 --> 01:36:17,833
Thank you aII for coming.

982
01:36:17,905 --> 01:36:20,840
A Iot of you have known my dad
since he was a kid.

983
01:36:25,012 --> 01:36:26,843
I wrote a speech.

984
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:29,178
A few, actuaIIy.

985
01:36:32,453 --> 01:36:35,445
Me and my dad,
we had a different Ianguage.

986
01:36:35,489 --> 01:36:38,151
A Iove that we aIways shared.

987
01:36:43,263 --> 01:36:45,493
And I know that...

988
01:36:46,533 --> 01:36:50,560
That's the one that he'd want me
to share with aII of you guys today.

989
01:37:34,181 --> 01:37:36,240
Hi, Daddy.

990
01:38:52,392 --> 01:38:56,158
Ronnie, I'm reaIIy sorry for your Ioss.

991
01:38:58,966 --> 01:39:00,524
Hey.

992
01:39:02,769 --> 01:39:04,464
Look, thank you for everything.

993
01:39:04,504 --> 01:39:07,598
- Thank you for coming.
- Of course.

994
01:39:07,641 --> 01:39:09,905
I reaIIy appreciate
everything you did, though.

995
01:39:10,677 --> 01:39:12,372
Thank you.

996
01:39:19,953 --> 01:39:21,511
Hey.

997
01:39:23,156 --> 01:39:24,953
It was beautifuI, what you pIayed.

998
01:39:25,492 --> 01:39:27,756
It was Dad's.

999
01:39:27,794 --> 01:39:31,355
- I finished it for him.
- I know he Iiked it.

1000
01:39:32,966 --> 01:39:35,958
Thank you for coming, WiII.
It meant so much to me.

1001
01:39:38,005 --> 01:39:41,031
Ronnie, I have someone
I'd Iike for you to meet.

1002
01:39:43,677 --> 01:39:45,736
I want to introduce you
to Tommy Hampton.

1003
01:39:45,812 --> 01:39:48,713
He taught your father...

1004
01:40:59,453 --> 01:41:01,887
Ronnie, I'm so sorry about everything.

1005
01:41:01,922 --> 01:41:03,913
I'm sorry, too.

1006
01:41:05,892 --> 01:41:08,053
PeopIe make mistakes, WiII.

1007
01:41:08,095 --> 01:41:10,586
Even the peopIe that we Iove.

1008
01:41:18,505 --> 01:41:20,268
I've decided to go to JuiIIiard.

1009
01:41:20,340 --> 01:41:22,638
Yeah, I heard. That's great news.

1010
01:41:22,709 --> 01:41:25,337
How's VanderbiIt?

1011
01:41:26,847 --> 01:41:28,314
It's a reaIIy good schooI.

1012
01:41:29,549 --> 01:41:33,485
Yeah. I'm not sure it's for me, though.

1013
01:41:35,756 --> 01:41:38,987
- What do you mean?
- I'm thinking of maybe transferring

1014
01:41:39,059 --> 01:41:40,924
to CoIumbia next semester.

1015
01:41:41,661 --> 01:41:45,097
So the girI I Iove can
watch me make a few more mistakes.

1016
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:48,766
What do you think about that?
