He wants you now.
Now you can talk.

156
00:16:04,173 --> 00:16:05,970
Inspector Peterson, Mrs. Beragon.

157
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:07,964
-How do you do?
-How do you do?

158
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,044
Won't you sit down?

159
00:16:10,213 --> 00:16:14,729
Sorry about your husband.
It must be a shock to you.

160
00:16:14,893 --> 00:16:16,724
Well, I. . . .

161
00:16:17,733 --> 00:16:21,772
I'm afraid I don't quite know
how to begin.

162
00:16:22,813 --> 00:16:26,886
You see, the fact of the matter is,
Mrs. Beragon, we don't need you.

163
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:28,247
You don't need me?

164
00:16:28,413 --> 00:16:31,246
I don't know how to apologize for
bringing you down here for nothing.

165
00:16:31,413 --> 00:16:36,407
But, you understand, we had to be sure.
Well, now we are sure.

166
00:16:36,573 --> 00:16:39,531
Aren't you going to ask me questions?
I thought you would.

167
00:16:39,693 --> 00:16:44,209
I know. Everybody thinks detectives
do nothing but ask questions. . .

168
00:16:44,373 --> 00:16:48,127
. . .but detectives have souls,
the same as anyone else.

169
00:16:48,293 --> 00:16:51,285
-Cigarette?
-No, thank you.

170
00:16:51,453 --> 00:16:53,887
Go ahead. It's all right.

171
00:16:54,053 --> 00:16:58,888
Mrs. Beragon, being a detective is like,
well, like making an automobile.

172
00:16:59,053 --> 00:17:01,886
You take all the pieces
and put them together one by one.

173
00:17:02,053 --> 00:17:05,682
First thing you know, you got
an automobile. Or a murderer.

174
00:17:05,853 --> 00:17:06,888
And we got him.

175
00:17:07,053 --> 00:17:10,329
You're in the clear, Mrs. Beragon.
The case is on ice.

176
00:17:10,493 --> 00:17:12,245
Well, you can go now.

177
00:17:12,413 --> 00:17:14,165
All right, men.

MILDRED:
Could you--?

179
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:21,052
-Would you tell me who---?
-Who did it?

180
00:17:21,213 --> 00:17:23,647
Sure. You're entitled to know.

181
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:35,322
No.

182
00:17:35,493 --> 00:17:36,926
No!

183
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:43,129
Yes, he did it.

184
00:17:43,293 --> 00:17:47,525
-Your first husband. Pierce.
-No, Bert, I won't let you do this.

185
00:17:47,693 --> 00:17:49,684
Wally Fay.
How do you know he didn't do it?

186
00:17:49,853 --> 00:17:52,128
Fay had no motive. This man had.

187
00:17:52,293 --> 00:17:54,488
You see, we start out with nothing.

188
00:17:54,653 --> 00:17:57,770
Just a corpse,
if you'll pardon the expression.

189
00:17:57,933 --> 00:18:00,606
We look at the corpse and we say,
"Why? What was the reason?"

190
00:18:00,773 --> 00:18:05,369
And when we find the reason,
we find the man that made the corpse.

191
00:18:05,533 --> 00:18:08,366
In this case, him.

192
00:18:08,533 --> 00:18:10,330
Come on.

193
00:18:15,893 --> 00:18:19,886
-But he didn't do it. I know he didn't.
-Do you?

194
00:18:20,053 --> 00:18:22,647
The murder was committed with this.

195
00:18:22,813 --> 00:18:26,010
-Do you know who it belongs to?
-No. I don't know.

196
00:18:26,173 --> 00:18:29,449
We do. It belongs to Pierce.
That's fact number one.

197
00:18:29,613 --> 00:18:32,252
Fact number two:
He doesn't deny killing Beragon.

198
00:18:32,413 --> 00:18:35,803
He seems to think it was a good idea.
If there's one thing we know. . .

199
00:18:35,973 --> 00:18:41,525
. . .it's that an innocent man always
denies the crime, loud and often.

200
00:18:41,693 --> 00:18:43,729
Pierce doesn't.

201
00:18:43,893 --> 00:18:47,169
So do you blame us for feeling
fairly confident that he's the man. . .

202
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:49,688
. . .who put four shots
out of six into Beragon?

203
00:18:49,853 --> 00:18:52,526
But he didn't. He couldn't.
He's too gentle and kind.

204
00:18:52,693 --> 00:18:55,253
Okay. He's kind and gentle.
He's wonderful.

205
00:18:55,413 --> 00:18:59,008
But if he's so wonderful, Mrs. Beragon,
why did you divorce him?

206
00:19:04,013 --> 00:19:06,129
Because I was wrong.

207
00:19:06,293 --> 00:19:10,525
It's taken me four years to find
that out, but now I know I was wrong.

208
00:19:10,693 --> 00:19:14,481
Let's see. Four years ago he was
in the real-estate business, wasn't he?

209
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:19,090
Yes. He and Wally Fay were partners.
For a long time they made good money.

210
00:19:19,253 --> 00:19:23,041
They built a lot of houses.
Suddenly, everybody stopped buying.

211
00:19:23,213 --> 00:19:24,885
-The boom was over.
-Yes?

212
00:19:25,053 --> 00:19:28,841
Then one day they split up.
Wally was in and Bert was out.

Where'd you get the money?

Making cakes and pies

Good afternoon.

-Roast chicken is nice.
-No, thank you. I'll. . . .

WAITRESS:
I caught you red-handed.

462
00:33:30,853 --> 00:33:32,809
I didn't take your rotten tip.

463
00:33:32,973 --> 00:33:36,568
-What's the trouble?
-She's lifting tips. I've seen her.

464
00:33:37,693 --> 00:33:40,127
Go into the kitchen.
You keep out of it.

-Someone will take care of you right away.

-I hope so. I have--
-You mind your own business.

-You wanted tea?
-No, I want a job.

-What?
-Well, you seem to need help. . . .

-You ever work in a restaurant before?
-No.

Follow me.

473
00:34:09,653 --> 00:34:12,725
-Kind of a nervous gal, aren't you?
-I'm just a little anxious.

474
00:34:12,893 --> 00:34:15,771
You want to watch that.
It's tough on dishes.

475
00:34:15,933 --> 00:34:20,404
I don't think you're the type for
the work, but I'll give you a trial.

476
00:34:20,573 --> 00:34:24,725
You need white shoes. Ask for nurses'
regulation in any store. $2.95.

477
00:34:24,893 --> 00:34:27,965
We furnish the uniform, but it
comes off your check. $3.95.

478
00:34:28,133 --> 00:34:30,169
You get it at cost.
Keep it laundered.

If you don't suit us, we charge you 25

Just like you been sleeping all night,

She makes me wear it in case
I have to answer the doorbell.

Miss Veda gave it to you?

513

I told her you wouldn't like it.
I told her right off.

Fay is the name. No, Fay.
That's right. Goodbye.

592
00:40:52,253 --> 00:40:55,370
He's sweating blood already.
Come on, let's go.

593
00:40:55,533 --> 00:40:58,093
And, remember,
let me do all the talking.

594
00:40:58,253 --> 00:41:02,166
-Oh, Wally, you're wonderful!
-Ah, ah. This is all business, remember?

595
00:41:11,133 --> 00:41:13,044
Yep! This is it.

596
00:41:26,453 --> 00:41:28,603
Will you wait here, please?

597
00:41:44,213 --> 00:41:46,852
Mr. Beragon, I talked to you
on the phone.

598
00:41:47,013 --> 00:41:48,924
This is Mrs. Pierce, the client.

599
00:41:49,093 --> 00:41:51,288
MILDRED: How do you do?
-How do you do?

600
00:41:51,453 --> 00:41:53,171
Would you like a drink?

601
00:41:53,333 --> 00:41:56,803
-I'm trapped. You talked me into it.
-Mrs. Pierce?

602
00:41:56,973 --> 00:42:00,170
As I see it, she wants the house
but doesn't want to pay.

603
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:03,609
Well, that's about it.
Mrs. Pierce needs time to get started.

604
00:42:03,773 --> 00:42:06,845
But once the restaurant is successful,
she'll buy the property outright.

605
00:42:07,013 --> 00:42:09,208
I see. A very unusual proposition.

606
00:42:09,373 --> 00:42:12,763
-How long do you need, Mrs. Pierce?
-I'd say about a year.

607
00:42:12,933 --> 00:42:15,766
-You think you can make $ 1 0,000?
-Yes, I have it all--

608
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:18,652
WALLY: Look, if the place is successful,
it'll be very successful.

609
00:42:18,813 --> 00:42:21,964
If it isn't, you'll get your
property back in better condition.

610
00:42:22,133 --> 00:42:24,283
What do you say? It's a gamble,
but you can't lose much.

611
00:42:24,453 --> 00:42:28,526
I like to gamble, Mr. Fay.
But the odds are against me.

612
00:42:28,693 --> 00:42:31,969
-I'm afraid I'm not interested.
-Please, listen to me.

613
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:33,691
This is a gamble for me too.

614
00:42:33,853 --> 00:42:37,209
I'm putting every cent
I have into this place. I haven't much.

615
00:42:37,373 --> 00:42:40,490
I can't afford to lose.
I've got all the information.

616
00:42:40,653 --> 00:42:43,121
I know what it will cost
and how much I can make.

617
00:42:43,293 --> 00:42:45,488
I know I can do it. I know I can!

618
00:42:47,293 --> 00:42:50,683
-Very well. It's a deal.
-Great! I'll draw up the papers.

619
00:42:50,853 --> 00:42:54,289
One more thing. We need
a pre-dated transfer of ownership.

620
00:42:54,453 --> 00:42:55,932
-You want it immediately?
-Yeah.

621
00:42:56,093 --> 00:42:58,607
We'll give you a note,
you give us the deed.

622
00:42:58,773 --> 00:43:01,048
You take care of the details.

623
00:43:01,213 --> 00:43:04,410
Well, how does it feel to be
the owner of a white elephant?

624
00:43:04,573 --> 00:43:07,485
Oh, it feels wonderful!

625
00:43:07,653 --> 00:43:10,087
How about Uncle Wally?

626
00:43:11,613 --> 00:43:13,524
-Nice guy.
-Very. Good-looking too.

627
00:43:13,693 --> 00:43:15,684
-Maybe, but no brains.
-What do you mean?

628
00:43:15,853 --> 00:43:18,765
You conning him out of the deed
without putting down a cent.

629
00:43:18,933 --> 00:43:21,891
-Sure!
-You leave the angles to Uncle Wally.

630
00:43:22,053 --> 00:43:24,613
-There's one other thing to do.
-What's that?

631
00:43:24,773 --> 00:43:26,968
Sorry.
I don't feel romantic this afternoon.

632
00:43:27,133 --> 00:43:29,772
No, nothing like that.
It's serious. It's about Bert.

633
00:43:29,933 --> 00:43:31,969
-What's on your mind?
-You won't like it.

634
00:43:32,133 --> 00:43:35,409
You'll have to get a divorce
if you want to open that restaurant.

635
00:43:35,573 --> 00:43:37,131
What's that got to do with it?

636
00:43:37,293 --> 00:43:39,761
In California, they got
a community property law.

637
00:43:39,933 --> 00:43:42,811
-Half of what's Bert's is yours.
-What's half of nothing?

638
00:43:42,973 --> 00:43:45,441
It works two ways.
Half of what you own is Bert's.

639
00:43:45,613 --> 00:43:49,606
You open that restaurant and Bert's
creditors will be saying, "Give me. "

640
00:43:49,773 --> 00:43:51,525
-Is a divorce the only answer?
-Uh-huh. Why?

641
00:43:51,693 --> 00:43:54,924
-It takes a year to get a divorce.
-Are you getting cold feet?

642
00:43:55,093 --> 00:43:56,651
Why bother if it takes a year?

643
00:43:56,813 --> 00:44:00,488
It takes a year to be final. Once
entered, the creditors can't touch you.

644
00:44:00,653 --> 00:44:03,451
-Your worries are over.
-I'll be seeing Bert next week.

645
00:44:03,613 --> 00:44:06,081
He's coming to take
the children for the weekend.

646
00:44:06,253 --> 00:44:08,608
-I'll think about it.
-Nothing to think about!

647
00:44:08,773 --> 00:44:11,890
-No divorce, no restaurant!
-I'll think about it, Wally!

648
00:44:12,053 --> 00:44:16,012
I'd have to know a little more about
it. Divorce is serious. I'm not--

649
00:44:16,173 --> 00:44:17,447
-Hello, Dad!
-Hello, dear.

650
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:18,966
We'll be down in a minute.

651
00:44:19,133 --> 00:44:21,693
Veda wants to know where
her new bathing suit is.

652
00:44:21,853 --> 00:44:25,084
-It's in the top drawer of her dresser.
-Okay!

653
00:44:25,253 --> 00:44:28,609
She says it's in the upper drawer
of the dresser.

654
00:44:29,093 --> 00:44:31,368
[KAY COUGHING ]

655
00:44:31,533 --> 00:44:32,886
Here.

656
00:44:34,253 --> 00:44:36,721
I wonder if there are many boys
up at Arrowhead.

657
00:44:36,893 --> 00:44:39,851
If there are, they're sure to find you.
Don't worry.

658
00:44:40,173 --> 00:44:43,370
I hate this as much as you.
But it's got to be, for the children.

659
00:44:43,533 --> 00:44:45,205
I have to think of their future.

660
00:44:45,373 --> 00:44:46,965
-Of Veda, you mean.
-All right, of Veda.

661
00:44:47,133 --> 00:44:50,489
-What about Kay?
-Kay doesn't need so much thinking about.

662
00:44:50,653 --> 00:44:54,646
Kay's twice the girl Veda is and always
will be. She thinks you're wonderful.

663
00:44:54,813 --> 00:44:58,488
-Maybe that's why I try to please Veda.
-You'll always get kicked around.

664
00:44:58,653 --> 00:45:02,168
You ought to know. I've made up
my mind. I want a divorce.

665
00:45:02,333 --> 00:45:04,563
I want to know a whole lot
more about this deal.

666
00:45:04,733 --> 00:45:07,167
-What have you got to do with that?
-You're my wife.

667
00:45:07,333 --> 00:45:10,848
You seem to forget about it
when it comes to Maggie Biederhof.

668
00:45:11,013 --> 00:45:15,689
-Well, what about you and Wally Fay?
-You should know better than that.

669
00:45:15,853 --> 00:45:19,368
Bert, listen. I've put everything
I've got into this restaurant.

670
00:45:19,533 --> 00:45:21,842
I've worked with painters, carpenters,
electricians.

671
00:45:22,013 --> 00:45:24,652
And suddenly,
everything is beginning to take shape.

672
00:45:24,813 --> 00:45:27,452
I've worked hard.
I'm going to get that divorce.

673
00:45:27,613 --> 00:45:30,047
I know. You want me to poke you
in the nose. . .

674
00:45:30,213 --> 00:45:32,727
. . .so you can claim I was guilty of cruelty.

675
00:45:32,893 --> 00:45:35,691
No, Mildred. No divorce.

676
00:45:35,853 --> 00:45:38,731
I'm going to file papers.
There's little you can do about it.

677
00:45:38,893 --> 00:45:42,602
-I don't need your permission.
-No? Well, file away.

678
00:45:42,773 --> 00:45:45,128
I'll fight you all the way.
You and Wally Fay.

679
00:45:45,293 --> 00:45:49,525
-And what's more, I'm--
KAY: You don't have to worry about me.

680
00:45:49,693 --> 00:45:52,207
Well, that was quick.
My, how nice you look.

681
00:45:52,373 --> 00:45:54,648
-Thank you.
-Hello, Father.

682
00:45:54,813 --> 00:45:57,646
-Goodbye, Mom.
-Goodbye, darling.

683
00:45:57,813 --> 00:46:01,203
Have fun. Be careful swimming.
That water's awfully cold!

684
00:46:01,373 --> 00:46:03,682
VEDA: Bye!
-Bye!

685
00:46:03,853 --> 00:46:06,128
KAY: Dad, on the way,
can we stop and have a hamburger?

686
00:46:06,293 --> 00:46:09,490
Oh, I guess so.
We'll have to hurry, though.

687
00:46:26,893 --> 00:46:30,249
It's moments like this that make
me happy that nylons are out.

688
00:46:30,413 --> 00:46:32,847
Well, if it isn't our silent partner.

689
00:46:33,013 --> 00:46:36,244
I've been silent long enough.
I came to check on my investment.

690
00:46:36,413 --> 00:46:39,086
-Well, how do you like it?
-Delightful.

691
00:46:39,253 --> 00:46:41,164
Sure you're here
to check on your investment?

692
00:46:41,333 --> 00:46:44,530
-Oh, absolutely.
-Then you'd better look.

693
00:46:44,693 --> 00:46:48,572
Over there's the counter. Here will be
one table and over here four tables.

694
00:46:48,733 --> 00:46:51,884
We have 1 0 booths, four people
to a booth. That's 40 people.

695
00:46:52,053 --> 00:46:53,645
-We can expect to feed--
-Ingenious.

696
00:46:53,813 --> 00:46:56,407
But today's a holiday.
Why don't you get out of here?

697
00:46:56,573 --> 00:46:59,804
I'd love to, but I'm awfully busy.
Isn't the bar beautiful?

698
00:46:59,973 --> 00:47:03,602
I've got one at the beach house.
Why don't you come see my ocean?

699
00:47:03,773 --> 00:47:06,492
I've seen one. If you've seen one,
you've seen them all.

700
00:47:06,653 --> 00:47:09,963
Why should people come to eat
and go someplace else to drink?

701
00:47:10,133 --> 00:47:13,045
-That's why I put the bar in--
-Logical. But, back to my ocean.

702
00:47:13,213 --> 00:47:15,727
Why don't we go have a swim
and forget about our investment?

703
00:47:15,893 --> 00:47:17,531
Oh, I'd love to, but. . . .

704
00:47:17,693 --> 00:47:20,332
-Uh-uh. Got too much to do.
-Come on.

705
00:47:20,493 --> 00:47:21,892
Look out. I might say yes.

706
00:47:22,053 --> 00:47:24,726
-You know what might be highly original?
-No. What?

707
00:47:24,893 --> 00:47:28,090
Just say yes. Right away like that.

708
00:47:28,253 --> 00:47:29,732
No. No, I shouldn't.

709
00:47:29,893 --> 00:47:33,249
You'll find that the only things you
regret are the things you didn't do.

710
00:47:33,413 --> 00:47:34,607
I hope you're right.

711
00:47:34,773 --> 00:47:38,846
Look. Why don't I pick you up
in, say, 30 minutes.

712
00:47:39,013 --> 00:47:41,766
No, I really can't.

713
00:47:41,933 --> 00:47:46,768
-How about it?
-All right. You win.

714
00:47:50,773 --> 00:47:56,325
There you are. Just help yourself. If you
don't find what you want, let me know.

715
00:47:56,493 --> 00:47:59,803
-Are you hoarding bathing suits?
-They belong to my sisters.

716
00:47:59,973 --> 00:48:02,043
There's nothing like having
a large family.

717
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:06,047
-Yell if you need help with the zipper.
-Thank you, but I won't need any help.

718
00:48:06,213 --> 00:48:10,172
-How do you like your drink?
-Harmless.

719
00:48:16,573 --> 00:48:20,009
-I like your ocean.
-I borrowed it from the Navy just for you.

720
00:48:20,173 --> 00:48:23,643
-You have a wonderful view.
-Well, I wouldn't say that.

721
00:48:23,813 --> 00:48:25,849
I hope the suit fits better
than the robe.

722
00:48:26,013 --> 00:48:28,686
It does.
Do you live here year round?

723
00:48:28,853 --> 00:48:32,084
No, we have a family mansion
in Pasadena. Complete with iron deer. . .

724
00:48:32,253 --> 00:48:35,211
. . .a ghost and a greenhouse.
I come here in the spring.

725
00:48:35,373 --> 00:48:37,682
-It must be lovely.
-Yes, but lonely.

726
00:48:37,853 --> 00:48:42,210
In the spring, a man's fancy turns to
what he's thought about all winter.

727
00:48:42,373 --> 00:48:45,570
It's a good thing California winters
are so short.

728
00:48:48,053 --> 00:48:52,092
-No whistle?
-I'd need a police siren.

729
00:48:52,253 --> 00:48:54,892
-Well, here we go.
-Go? Go where?

730
00:48:55,053 --> 00:48:59,444
-Swimming. Isn't that why we're here?
-I suppose it is. Wait a minute.

731
00:48:59,613 --> 00:49:01,524
-Come on.
-Hold it.

732
00:49:17,373 --> 00:49:18,886
-Drink?
-No, thank you.

733
00:49:19,053 --> 00:49:22,602
-You drink too much.

-You've got a nice voice. Did you know?
-Thank you.

01:00:04,016 --> 01:00:06,576
WALLY:
Hi. Congratulations. You're a success.

885
01:00:06,736 --> 01:00:10,251
MONTE: We've been getting acquainted.
-He's promised to take me the races.

886
01:00:10,416 --> 01:00:12,247
-lf your mother comes too.
-I'd love to.

887
01:00:12,416 --> 01:00:14,372
-Wally, do me a favor.
-Anything.

888
01:00:14,536 --> 01:00:16,015
-Take Veda home.
-What?

889
01:00:16,176 --> 01:00:19,373
-Anyone would think I was a child.
-You are. It's past your bedtime.

890
01:00:19,536 --> 01:00:23,529
It's not past my bedtime.
Besides, I want to take you home.

891
01:00:23,696 --> 01:00:26,415
I've got to close up.
I'll go home with Ida.

892
01:00:26,576 --> 01:00:30,330
Sure is a big night for me.
I came out for an evening of fun.

893
01:00:30,496 --> 01:00:34,250
What do I get? Dishpan hands
and a date with a Girl Scout.

894
01:00:34,416 --> 01:00:36,293
-Good night.
-Good night.

895
01:00:36,456 --> 01:00:39,209
Good night, Mr. Beragon.
Thank you for everything.

896
01:00:39,376 --> 01:00:42,413
-I trust that we may meet again very soon.
-I hope so.

897
01:00:42,576 --> 01:00:47,775
Thank you, Mrs. Pierce. I trust that I might
see you in the not-too-distant future.

898
01:00:47,936 --> 01:00:49,255
-Come on.
-I'm coming.

01:00:49,416 --> 01:00:51,805
Come on. Never mind. Hurry up.

VEDA:
For heaven's sake.

901
01:00:56,376 --> 01:00:58,571
Leave something on me.
I might catch cold.

902
01:00:58,736 --> 01:01:03,014
I was just thinking.
Not about you. Come on.

903
01:01:03,336 --> 01:01:05,531
-That's a cute youngster of yours.
-Isn't she?

904
01:01:05,696 --> 01:01:08,256
I thought you had two.

905
01:01:08,416 --> 01:01:12,011
-Kay died.
-I'm sorry. You should have let me know.

906
01:01:12,176 --> 01:01:14,565
-Let's not talk about it.
-You've had tough breaks. . .

907
01:01:14,736 --> 01:01:16,772
. . .but you're going to make a go
of this place.

908
01:01:16,936 --> 01:01:18,335
Well, I hope so.

909
01:01:18,496 --> 01:01:21,852
-Don't you ever do anything but work?
-Somebody's got to.

910
01:01:22,016 --> 01:01:25,691
Not all the time. There's a time
for work and a time for--

911
01:01:25,856 --> 01:01:30,247
Seventeen. Six minus seven.
Monte, don't. Not here.

912
01:01:30,416 --> 01:01:35,012
Why not? I've been waiting
all evening. A lifetime.

913
01:01:49,296 --> 01:01:52,413
BERT: I didn't mean to bust in like this.
-That's all right.

914
01:01:52,576 --> 01:01:56,330
This is my husband.
Mr. Beragon, Monte Beragon.

915
01:01:56,496 --> 01:01:59,568
-I've heard a lot of things about you.
-Nice things, I hope.

916
01:01:59,736 --> 01:02:03,012
-I'd like to speak to Mildred.
-Yes, of course.

917
01:02:03,176 --> 01:02:06,646
-What is it, Bert?
-This'll only take a minute.

918
01:02:07,576 --> 01:02:10,693
It's funny. It's harder
to say than I thought.

919
01:02:10,856 --> 01:02:13,768
It's about the divorce.
You can have it.

920
01:02:13,936 --> 01:02:17,292
When I walked out, I told you
to see if you could get along without me.

921
01:02:17,456 --> 01:02:20,766
I didn't think you could.
When you asked me for a divorce. . .

922
01:02:20,936 --> 01:02:24,053
. . .I still didn't think you
could make a go of it alone.

923
01:02:24,216 --> 01:02:26,684
Now I know better.
You're doing all right.

924
01:02:26,856 --> 01:02:30,007
-You're doing fine.
-I never thought it would end like this.

925
01:02:30,176 --> 01:02:32,371
Who knows how anything
is going to end?

926
01:02:32,696 --> 01:02:35,847
-I'm sorry.
-Yes, I'm sorry too.

927
01:02:36,016 --> 01:02:39,770
Well, that's what I came
to say, and now that I've said it. . .

-Well, goodbye.
-Goodbye.

MONTE:
This calls for a drink.

932
01:02:50,176 --> 01:02:53,407
In the Beragon family,
there is an old Spanish proverb:

933
01:02:53,576 --> 01:02:56,044
One man's poison
is another man's meat.

Bert!

936
01:03:11,616 --> 01:03:14,813
I was in love with him, and I knew it
for the first time that night. . .

937
01:03:14,976 --> 01:03:18,730
. . .but now he's dead, and I'm not sorry.
He wasn't worth it.

938
01:03:18,896 --> 01:03:22,525
That may be. Whoever killed him
evidently agreed with you.

939
01:03:22,696 --> 01:03:26,575
But you haven't given us one reason why
your first husband wasn't the murderer.

940
01:03:26,736 --> 01:03:29,455
In fact, you've given us
a very good reason why he was.

941
01:03:29,616 --> 01:03:33,495
Look at it our way. One, Beragon
was killed with Pierce's gun.

942
01:03:33,656 --> 01:03:37,410
Two, Pierce cannot account for
his movements at the time of the murder.

943
01:03:37,576 --> 01:03:43,731
Three, he had a motive. You've just
given it to us, Mrs. Beragon. Jealousy.

944
01:03:43,896 --> 01:03:46,251
This just came in.
Thought you'd want it.

01:03:46,416 --> 01:03:49,408
-Will you excuse me?
-Certainly.

946
01:03:52,016 --> 01:03:56,168
-Is he sure?
-Charley don't like to make mistakes.

947
01:03:56,336 --> 01:03:58,247
Just a minute.

948
01:03:58,416 --> 01:04:02,455
Mrs. Beragon, we have some
information here which puzzles us a little.

949
01:04:02,976 --> 01:04:06,685
For instance, your business manager. . . .

950
01:04:06,856 --> 01:04:09,734
-Right away.
-Okay.

951
01:04:09,896 --> 01:04:14,492
Ida Corwin. She tells us that you
called her at approximately 1 1 :45 p.m. . .

952
01:04:14,656 --> 01:04:16,806
. . .and asked her where Mr. Beragon was.

953
01:04:16,976 --> 01:04:21,333
-You seemed quite upset at the time.
-It was just a business matter.

954
01:04:21,496 --> 01:04:24,806
-Then there was nothing wrong?
-No.

955
01:04:24,976 --> 01:04:28,491
Occasionally we run across
a witness who refuses to tell us. . .

956
01:04:28,656 --> 01:04:33,810
. . .what we want to know, except under
pressure. Like Wally Fay, for example.

957
01:04:33,976 --> 01:04:38,128
Why did you take him to the beach house?
Did you know Beragon was there, dead?

958
01:04:38,296 --> 01:04:41,208
-No, I didn't.
-Then you were at the beach house.

959
01:04:41,376 --> 01:04:44,971
Why didn't you tell us that before?
Why did you run from the house?

960
01:04:45,136 --> 01:04:47,889
Wasn't it because you
knew Beragon was there, dead?

961
01:04:48,056 --> 01:04:52,686
And if you did know, why were you
trying to pin the murder onto Fay? Why?

962
01:04:53,216 --> 01:04:56,253
I think you'd better
tell us the truth now.

963
01:04:58,896 --> 01:05:00,329
I did it.

964
01:05:00,496 --> 01:05:01,611
I killed him.

965
01:05:01,776 --> 01:05:07,169
But why? Your restaurant was a success.
You were in love with Beragon.

966
01:05:07,856 --> 01:05:10,848
What happened to all that?

967
01:05:11,016 --> 01:05:15,692
The restaurant was a greater success
than I knew. Profits were enormous.

968
01:05:15,856 --> 01:05:19,212
In a few months I opened another place,
and then I started a chain.

969
01:05:19,376 --> 01:05:21,685
<i>In three years I built five restaurants.</i>

970
01:05:21,856 --> 01:05:25,292
<i>Everywhere you went,</i>
<i>I had a restaurant. They made money.</i>

971
01:05:25,456 --> 01:05:30,405
<i>Everything I touched turned into money,</i>
<i>and I needed it. I needed it for Veda.</i>

972
01:05:34,656 --> 01:05:38,012
<i>She was becoming a young lady</i>
<i>with expensive tastes.</i>

973
01:05:38,336 --> 01:05:40,975
<i>Veda was growing up.</i>

974
01:05:58,376 --> 01:06:01,573
That Ted Forrester is nice-looking.
Veda likes him.

975
01:06:01,736 --> 01:06:03,852
Who wouldn't?
He has a million dollars.

976
01:06:04,016 --> 01:06:07,850
-What's the matter?
-Nothing. I've just run out of jokes.

977
01:06:08,016 --> 01:06:11,213
-What is it? Tell me.
-I've had a little bad luck lately.

978
01:06:11,376 --> 01:06:14,891
I won't be able to afford
many more evenings like this.

979
01:06:15,056 --> 01:06:18,810
-Do you need money?
-No, no. It isn't anything like that.

980
01:06:18,976 --> 01:06:23,254
-I think you do.
-Mildred, please don't do that.

981
01:06:23,416 --> 01:06:27,011
You've been awfully good to us, Monte.
Take it, please.

982
01:06:27,176 --> 01:06:32,296
If you say so. But I'll pay it back.
I want it understood that it's only a loan.

983
01:06:32,456 --> 01:06:36,165
Anything you say,
just as long as we're friends.

984
01:06:39,536 --> 01:06:44,052
<i>That's how it began. At first it</i>
<i>bothered Monte to take money from me.</i>

01:06:44,216 --> 01:06:47,253
<i>Then it became a habit with him.</i>

There's a total here
of $ 1 480.29 in six months.

987
01:06:50,856 --> 01:06:52,733
-What's the big idea?
-We owe him a great deal.

988
01:06:52,896 --> 01:06:55,456
The restaurant's paid for.
You don't owe him a cent.

989
01:06:55,616 --> 01:06:58,335
I manage this business,
and I've done all right.

990
01:06:58,496 --> 01:07:01,249
Keeping Beragon in shirts
is not my idea of business.

991
01:07:01,416 --> 01:07:02,531
-No?
-No!

992
01:07:02,696 --> 01:07:05,335
Look, I made this business for you
with my own hands.

993
01:07:05,496 --> 01:07:07,691
I got banks to give you credit.
That wasn't easy.

994
01:07:07,856 --> 01:07:11,531
I conned everybody, and for what? So you
could have a lap dog named Beragon?

995
01:07:11,696 --> 01:07:13,891
-Take it easy, Wally.
-When you walked out on Bert. . .

996
01:07:14,056 --> 01:07:15,728
. . .I was glad to see you get some sense.

997
01:07:15,896 --> 01:07:18,968
-Beragon's worse.
-That's none of your business.

998
01:07:19,136 --> 01:07:25,245
It is. I helped you so I'd be around when
your mind changed. Maybe I was wrong.

999
01:07:25,416 --> 01:07:29,170
-Maybe you were.
-Beragon is no good. He'll bleed you dry.

1000
01:07:29,736 --> 01:07:32,409
Suppose I'm in love with him.

1001
01:07:35,336 --> 01:07:36,974
Huh.

1002
01:07:37,136 --> 01:07:38,854
Okay.

1003
01:07:39,016 --> 01:07:42,167
-At least now I know where I stand.
-That's right. Now you know.

1004
01:07:48,296 --> 01:07:50,287
-I hate all women.
-My, my.

1005
01:07:50,456 --> 01:07:53,368
Thank goodness you're not one.

Laughing boy seems burned
at the edges. What's eating him?

1007
01:07:56,976 --> 01:07:58,967
-A small, green-eyed monster.
-Jealous?

1008
01:07:59,136 --> 01:08:03,209
Doesn't sound like Wally. No profit in it,
and that boy loves a dollar.

1009
01:08:03,376 --> 01:08:07,449
-I told him I was in love with Beragon.
-Are you?

1010
01:08:07,616 --> 01:08:10,494
I thought I was once, but not now.

1011
01:08:10,856 --> 01:08:12,130
Good.

1012
01:08:12,296 --> 01:08:15,208
-What's that?
-A $ 1 800 birthday present for Veda.

1013
01:08:15,376 --> 01:08:20,450
-The car. It's here. Where is it?
-It's that shiny thing a block long.

1014
01:08:23,696 --> 01:08:26,927
-Do you think she'll like it?
-lf she doesn't, have her head examined.

1015
01:08:27,096 --> 01:08:30,645
Here, you have to sign this in blood.

1016
01:08:31,176 --> 01:08:34,248
-It isn't any of my business--
-lf it's about Monte, I agree.

1017
01:08:34,416 --> 01:08:36,452
It's Veda.
She's been borrowing money.

1018
01:08:36,816 --> 01:08:39,535
-From whom?
-Anybody. Waitresses mostly.

1019
01:08:39,696 --> 01:08:41,766
Hasn't she paid them back?

1020
01:08:41,936 --> 01:08:46,248
They're afraid to say anything
or turn her down. You know how it is.

1021
01:08:46,496 --> 01:08:48,726
Tell them to come to me.
I'll see that they're paid.

1022
01:08:48,896 --> 01:08:51,694
I'm sorry I had to tell you.
I don't blame her much.

1023
01:08:51,856 --> 01:08:52,925
Monte was with her--

1024
01:08:53,096 --> 01:08:56,247
Did you bring the Laguna Beach
and Los Feliz statements?

1025
01:08:56,416 --> 01:08:58,850
Yeah. They're over here.

1026
01:08:59,856 --> 01:09:01,414
-Hello, everybody!
-Hello.

1027
01:09:01,576 --> 01:09:03,612
-Hello, Mother.
-Hello Veda, Monte.

1028
01:09:03,776 --> 01:09:06,165
I hope we aren't interrupting
a big conference.

1029
01:09:06,336 --> 01:09:09,533
-Just a teeny one.
-I wish I could get interested in work.

1030
01:09:09,696 --> 01:09:13,291
You were probably frightened
by a callus at an early age. I'll take that.

1031
01:09:13,456 --> 01:09:16,653
-Thank you.
-One missing.

1032
01:09:16,816 --> 01:09:19,284
You're sitting on
the Laguna Beach statement!

1033
01:09:19,456 --> 01:09:22,732
That's what I like about you.
You're so delightfully provincial.

1034
01:09:22,896 --> 01:09:27,048
I like you too. Don't look now,
but you're standing under a brick wall.

1035
01:09:27,216 --> 01:09:31,368
-I don't get it.
-You will, when it falls on you.

1036
01:09:33,936 --> 01:09:38,452
-When did you start smoking?
-Just the other day.

1037
01:09:38,616 --> 01:09:42,575
Monte gave me this for my birthday.
I couldn't hurt him by not using it.

1038
01:09:42,736 --> 01:09:47,491
I mean, that would have been dreadfully
<i>recherch, n 'est-ce pas?</i>

1039
01:09:47,856 --> 01:09:50,416
Yes, I suppose so.

1040
01:09:50,576 --> 01:09:53,409
Here's something for your birthday too.
I hope you like it.

1041
01:09:53,576 --> 01:09:58,206
-Mother! A car? Where is it?
-Look out the window.

1042
01:10:01,136 --> 01:10:05,015
-Mother, it's beautiful.
-I'm so glad you like it.

1043
01:10:05,176 --> 01:10:07,451
How about me?
After all, I picked it out.

1044
01:10:07,616 --> 01:10:10,733
Monte, it's the nicest present
I ever got.

1045
01:10:10,896 --> 01:10:14,445
-You're sweet. Let's go for a drive.
-Nothing I'd like better.

1046
01:10:14,616 --> 01:10:17,414
-Do you mind? I'd like to talk to you.
-Not at all.

1047
01:10:17,576 --> 01:10:19,567
-Run along and dent your fenders.
-All right.

1048
01:10:19,736 --> 01:10:21,931
MONTE: See you later at the club.
MILDRED: Be careful.

1049
01:10:22,096 --> 01:10:23,575
I will.

1050
01:10:34,496 --> 01:10:35,975
Bye.

1051
01:10:50,576 --> 01:10:53,932
-What's the matter?
-I want you to do me a favor.

1052
01:10:54,096 --> 01:10:56,451
-Sure. What?
-Stay away from Veda.

1053
01:10:56,616 --> 01:10:59,050
What's the matter with me?
Have I sprouted two heads?

1054
01:10:59,216 --> 01:11:02,049
I just don't want you
to take her out so much, that's all.

1055
01:11:02,216 --> 01:11:04,889
And it isn't funny.
She's only 1 7 and spoiled rotten.

1056
01:11:05,056 --> 01:11:07,775
-What has that got to do with me?
-Look, I've worked long and hard. . .

1057
01:11:07,936 --> 01:11:09,972
. . .to give Veda the things I never had.

1058
01:11:10,136 --> 01:11:15,005
I've done without a lot of things
because I wanted her to have everything.

1059
01:11:15,176 --> 01:11:16,655
Now I'm losing her.

1060
01:11:16,816 --> 01:11:18,727
She's drifting away from me.

1061
01:11:18,896 --> 01:11:21,171
She hardly speaks to me
except to ask for money. . .

1062
01:11:21,336 --> 01:11:23,611
. . .or poke fun at me
because I work for a living.

1063
01:11:23,776 --> 01:11:26,688
-All kids are thoughtless.
-Perhaps. I still don't like it.

1064
01:11:26,856 --> 01:11:28,812
I blame it on the way she's living.
And you.

1065
01:11:28,976 --> 01:11:32,332
I don't think you understand Veda
very well. She's not like you.

1066
01:11:32,496 --> 01:11:35,533
You'll never make a waitress
out of her.

1067
01:11:35,696 --> 01:11:39,530
You look down on me because
I work for a living, don't you?

1068
01:11:39,696 --> 01:11:43,291
All right, I work. I cook food,
sell it and make a profit. . .

1069
01:11:43,456 --> 01:11:46,016
. . .which you're not too proud to share.

1070
01:11:46,176 --> 01:11:48,007
Yes, I take money from you. . .

1071
01:11:48,176 --> 01:11:52,249
. . .but not enough to make me like
kitchens or cooks. They smell of grease.

1072
01:11:52,416 --> 01:11:55,852
You don't shrink away from a $50 bill
because it smells of grease.

1073
01:11:56,016 --> 01:11:58,576
-Take it easy.
-There's no point in going on like this.

1074
01:11:58,736 --> 01:12:00,806
You're interfering with my life
and business.

1075
01:12:00,976 --> 01:12:04,013
Worst of all, you're interfering
with my plans for Veda.

1076
01:12:04,176 --> 01:12:08,169
I always knew that someday
we'd come to this particular moment.

1077
01:12:08,336 --> 01:12:11,089
You want Veda and your business
and a nice, quiet life.

1078
01:12:11,256 --> 01:12:13,406
And the price of all that is me.

1079
01:12:13,576 --> 01:12:17,933
You can go back to making your pies
now, Mildred. We're through.

1080
01:12:18,096 --> 01:12:21,213
Wait a minute, Monte.
I forgot something.

1081
01:12:27,536 --> 01:12:31,324
You've been very good to us. I know
you've had expenses taking Veda out.

1082
01:12:31,496 --> 01:12:34,568
I don't know how much
we owe you, but. . . .

1083
01:12:34,736 --> 01:12:37,967
If that isn't enough,
you can let me know.

1084
01:12:38,136 --> 01:12:41,845
Thank you. I've always wondered
how it felt to take a tip.

1085
01:12:42,016 --> 01:12:43,734
Well, now you know.

1086
01:12:44,216 --> 01:12:47,526
You can mark
our account "paid in full. "

1087
01:12:59,376 --> 01:13:02,174
-I'd like some of that.
-You gotta work for it.

1088
01:13:02,336 --> 01:13:05,373
Keep your motor running.
Bring me three glasses, will you?

1089
01:13:05,536 --> 01:13:08,494
-This is beginning to look serious.
-It is.

1090
01:13:08,656 --> 01:13:12,331
-Yes, we finally made up our minds.
-This calls for a celebration.

1091
01:13:12,496 --> 01:13:15,249
-Congratulations, Romeo.
-You've been swell to us.

1092
01:13:15,416 --> 01:13:17,646
I get a kick out of doing
things for people.

1093
01:13:17,816 --> 01:13:19,693
-Don't I, Veda?
-Absolutely.

1094
01:13:19,856 --> 01:13:23,451
Looks like we never serve
champagne in this joint. Or place.

1095
01:13:23,616 --> 01:13:27,894
Try this on for size. It's our very best,
reserved for special customers.

1096
01:13:28,056 --> 01:13:31,048
California, '42.

1097
01:13:31,456 --> 01:13:34,254
Well, here's to. . . .

1098
01:13:34,416 --> 01:13:36,247
Here's to true love.

1099
01:13:36,416 --> 01:13:38,930
To true love.

1100
01:13:44,576 --> 01:13:49,411
The receipts at Arcadia have dropped
roughly 7 percent during the last month.

1101
01:13:49,576 --> 01:13:51,089
-Say, Mildred.
-Nearly 8 percent.

1102
01:13:51,256 --> 01:13:54,089
There's a Mrs. Forrester
waiting to see you.

1103
01:13:54,256 --> 01:13:56,724
-Oh, what about?
-Veda.

1104
01:13:56,896 --> 01:14:00,730
-Excuse me, Mr. Jones.
-Do you always interrupt?

1105
01:14:00,936 --> 01:14:03,052
Only because I want
to be alone with you.

1106
01:14:03,216 --> 01:14:05,491
Come here and let me bite you,
you darling boy.

1107
01:14:05,656 --> 01:14:07,214
[BARKS]

1108
01:14:09,536 --> 01:14:10,730
-Mrs. Pierce?
-Yes.

1109
01:14:10,896 --> 01:14:14,013
-I'm Mrs. Forrester. Ted's mother.
-How do you do?

1110
01:14:14,176 --> 01:14:16,736
Won't you come sit down, it would be
more comfortable.

1111
01:14:16,896 --> 01:14:20,252
I've been looking forward
to meeting you, Mrs. Pierce.

1112
01:14:20,416 --> 01:14:23,249
I'm sure we're going
to work out our problem splendidly.

1113
01:14:23,416 --> 01:14:25,850
-Little problem?
-Veda hasn't told you?

1114
01:14:26,016 --> 01:14:28,166
Told me what?

1115
01:14:28,336 --> 01:14:31,567
Your daughter has somehow
got the idea that--

1116
01:14:31,736 --> 01:14:34,773
I understand it.
Any girl wants to get married.

1117
01:14:35,136 --> 01:14:38,651
Ted had no such thing in mind.
I want that made clear.

1118
01:14:38,816 --> 01:14:40,932
You mean they're engaged,
Veda and Ted?

1119
01:14:41,096 --> 01:14:43,894
Yes. I'm quite sure you'll agree with me. . .

1120
01:14:44,056 --> 01:14:48,493
. . .that any discussion of marriage
between them would be most undesirable.

1121
01:14:48,656 --> 01:14:52,251
Why should Veda want to marry
your son if he doesn't want to marry her?

1122
01:14:52,416 --> 01:14:55,010
I'm not a mind reader,
but let me tell you. . .

1123
01:14:55,176 --> 01:14:58,805
. . .if this girl employs any more tricks
trying to blackmail my son--

1124
01:14:58,976 --> 01:15:01,729
-Trying to what?
-Understand me, Mrs. Pierce.

1125
01:15:01,896 --> 01:15:05,252
I shall prevent this marriage
in any way that I can.

1126
01:15:05,416 --> 01:15:07,532
I don't think you need worry.

1127
01:15:07,696 --> 01:15:12,770
Having you in my family is a pretty
dismal prospect. Good afternoon.

1128
01:15:21,096 --> 01:15:22,370
Veda, I want to talk to you.

1129
01:15:22,536 --> 01:15:24,049
-Hi, Mildred.
-Hello, Wally.

1130
01:15:24,216 --> 01:15:28,607
-What about?
-Mrs. Forrester came to see me today.

1131
01:15:28,776 --> 01:15:32,451
-Wally, this is private.
-That's all right. Wally knows about it.

1132
01:15:32,616 --> 01:15:34,686
He knows you and Ted
want to get married?

1133
01:15:35,136 --> 01:15:37,570
Want to get married?

1134
01:15:37,736 --> 01:15:41,285
We are married.
We were married on my birthday.

1135
01:15:41,456 --> 01:15:45,085
-I'm sorry, but it's done.
-Veda was trying to spare you.

1136
01:15:45,256 --> 01:15:48,373
She wanted to make things easier
for you so she asked me to help.

1137
01:15:48,536 --> 01:15:52,131
-Why didn't you tell me?
-I wanted to so many times.

1138
01:15:52,296 --> 01:15:57,416
But you seemed so far away.
I couldn't somehow. I was afraid.

1139
01:15:58,256 --> 01:16:01,851
-Afraid of your own mother?
-Mother, I've been so miserable.

1140
01:16:02,536 --> 01:16:06,165
I made a mistake,
and I didn't know how to tell you.

1141
01:16:08,016 --> 01:16:12,407
Darling, don't you love Ted?

1142
01:16:14,656 --> 01:16:16,806
No, Mother.

1143
01:16:18,736 --> 01:16:21,011
I'm sorry about that, Veda.

1144
01:16:21,176 --> 01:16:23,815
But maybe we don't belong
in a family like that.

1145
01:16:23,976 --> 01:16:27,855
That's right. Veda doesn't love this boy.
All right, so she made a mistake.

1146
01:16:28,016 --> 01:16:30,211
The thing to do is
to settle the case out of court.

1147
01:16:30,376 --> 01:16:34,085
-That's the clean way to handle it.
-All right.

1148
01:16:34,896 --> 01:16:38,605
"I, hereby, of my own free will,
renounce all right and title. . .

1149
01:16:38,776 --> 01:16:43,054
. . .that I, or my heirs and assignees,
may have to any moneys or estate. . .

1150
01:16:43,216 --> 01:16:48,085
. . .real or otherwise, which will accrue
or evolve to Theodore Forrester. . .

1151
01:16:48,456 --> 01:16:51,687
. . .in exchange for considerations
of value received. "

1152
01:16:52,776 --> 01:16:56,007
-Are you agreeable to this?
-Why can't we stay married?

1153
01:16:56,176 --> 01:16:58,895
-You will be good enough to keep quiet.
-Yes, Mother.

1154
01:16:59,056 --> 01:17:00,933
We can assume the waiver
is acceptable.

1155
01:17:01,096 --> 01:17:04,168
-Will you sign this, please?
-Yeah, sure. Glad to.

1156
01:17:04,336 --> 01:17:07,965
My client feels, and I am in complete
accord with her, that she has been irrep. . . .

1157
01:17:08,136 --> 01:17:11,333
-Uh. . . .
-Irreparably?

1158
01:17:11,496 --> 01:17:13,612
Unduly damaged.

1159
01:17:13,776 --> 01:17:16,495
Therefore, there's one more formality
we should discuss.

1160
01:17:16,656 --> 01:17:18,806
-What's that?
-The financial settlement.

1161
01:17:18,976 --> 01:17:21,171
You see, my client would like $ 1 0,000.

1162
01:17:21,976 --> 01:17:27,175
I think I'm safe in observing that
almost anyone would like $ 1 0,000, but. . . .

1163
01:17:27,336 --> 01:17:28,371
But. . .?

1164
01:17:28,536 --> 01:17:31,892
We see no necessity
for a financial settlement of any kind.

01:26:24,336 --> 01:26:29,091
I guess this calls for a celebration.
Maybe I'd better send out for a beer.

1308
01:26:29,256 --> 01:26:31,406
MILDRED: None for me.
-What can I do for you?

1309
01:26:31,576 --> 01:26:33,771
-I want to talk to you.
-Go ahead.

1310
01:26:33,936 --> 01:26:35,210
Well--

1311
01:26:35,376 --> 01:26:38,925
-Why don't you go see if Wally wants you.
-Oh, he won't.

1312
01:26:39,096 --> 01:26:42,406
Oh, pardon me, I'm sure.

1313
01:26:42,576 --> 01:26:45,136
Won't you sit down, Mother?

1314
01:26:47,016 --> 01:26:48,290
Well?

1315
01:26:48,456 --> 01:26:51,653
I want you to come home, Veda.
This isn't your kind of life.

1316
01:26:51,816 --> 01:26:55,934
-No? What is my kind of life, Mother?
-Well, I don't know.

1317
01:26:56,096 --> 01:26:59,771
Whatever makes you happy, I guess.
That's all I've ever wanted for you.

1318
01:26:59,936 --> 01:27:02,769
-Do you think I was happy in Glendale?
-Are you happy here?

1319
01:27:03,496 --> 01:27:07,375
When I first came here, I used to cry
occasionally. I've gotten over that.

1320
01:27:07,536 --> 01:27:10,414
-You're very fortunate.
-I know I've made you unhappy--

1321
01:27:10,576 --> 01:27:14,125
It isn't easy for me to beg like this,
but won't you please come home?

1322
01:27:14,296 --> 01:27:18,926
No. You must think I'm on a string.
"Go away, Veda. " "Come back, Veda. "

1323
01:27:19,096 --> 01:27:21,929
It isn't that easy. I'm free now.

1324
01:27:22,096 --> 01:27:27,045
No one tells me what to do. I do
what I think best, and I like it that way.

1325
01:27:27,336 --> 01:27:32,649
I've had the house redecorated. All new
furniture. Even a new piano. You'd like it.

1326
01:27:32,816 --> 01:27:34,886
You still don't understand, do you?

1327
01:27:35,056 --> 01:27:38,412
You think new curtains
are enough to make me happy.

1328
01:27:38,576 --> 01:27:40,168
I want more than that.

1329
01:27:40,336 --> 01:27:44,170
I want the kind of life Monte taught me,
and you won't give it to me.

1330
01:27:44,336 --> 01:27:48,124
I'm sorry for the trouble I've caused.
If I went home, it would start again.

1331
01:27:48,296 --> 01:27:50,730
You know that. You know how I am.

1332
01:27:51,456 --> 01:27:55,131
The way you want to live
isn't good enough for me.

1333
01:27:55,296 --> 01:27:58,174
If I could give you the life
Monte taught you. . .

1334
01:27:58,336 --> 01:28:00,486
. . .would you be willing
to come home then?

1335
01:28:00,656 --> 01:28:03,568
But you couldn't, could you, Mother?

1336
01:28:05,096 --> 01:28:09,169
You can powder your nose just so long.
Then people look at you funny.

1337
01:28:09,336 --> 01:28:11,167
-Anyhow, your number's coming up.
-All right.

1338
01:28:11,336 --> 01:28:14,134
Sorry, Mother. I'm on next.
I have to change.

1339
01:28:16,736 --> 01:28:18,374
-Do you mind?
-Not at all.

1340
01:28:18,536 --> 01:28:24,168
-When will I see you again, Veda?
-Just drop around. I'll be here. Bye.

1341
01:28:24,336 --> 01:28:25,928
Goodbye.

1342
01:28:33,616 --> 01:28:36,528
So much for the upstairs.
It's a little gloomy, isn't it?

1343
01:28:36,696 --> 01:28:40,609
Not quite so bad down here,
with the exception of the entrance hall.

1344
01:28:40,776 --> 01:28:45,008
As you can see, the pride of the
Beragons isn't rolling in wealth.

1345
01:28:45,176 --> 01:28:47,371
-You're not exhausted?
-Not at all.

1346
01:28:47,536 --> 01:28:51,973
-You can't be serious about buying it.
-You're not a very good salesman.

1347
01:28:52,136 --> 01:28:54,969
No, I suppose I'm not.
In here used to be a sitting room.

1348
01:28:55,136 --> 01:28:58,412
Still is. I do all my sitting here.
Becoming quite an expert at it.

1349
01:28:58,576 --> 01:29:01,488
-Do you live here alone?
-There are complete living quarters.

1350
01:29:01,656 --> 01:29:04,329
Somebody has to be on the premises
to show the place.

1351
01:29:04,496 --> 01:29:05,975
-Won't you sit down?
-Yes.

1352
01:29:06,136 --> 01:29:08,730
-Can I fix you a drink?
-Please.

1353
01:29:09,216 --> 01:29:12,014
I have the heel of a bottle,
no ice or seltzer.

1354
01:29:12,176 --> 01:29:16,727
-Sorry I can't be more hospitable.
-That's all right. I prefer it straight.

1355
01:29:16,896 --> 01:29:19,410
-I beg your pardon?
-I said, I prefer it straight.

1356
01:29:19,576 --> 01:29:20,850
Oh.

1357
01:29:21,016 --> 01:29:23,735
-Say when.
-When.

1358
01:29:23,896 --> 01:29:27,411
-What happened to your orange grove?
-Sold for taxes like everything else.

1359
01:29:27,576 --> 01:29:30,852
-The beach house too?
-No, not the beach house.

1360
01:29:31,016 --> 01:29:34,247
An uncle with a little money
wouldn't let me sell it.

1361
01:29:34,416 --> 01:29:36,532
He's hoping to foreclose on it instead.

1362
01:29:36,696 --> 01:29:38,891
Sounds like a nice uncle.

1363
01:29:40,576 --> 01:29:43,090
Now, Mildred, what do you want?

1364
01:29:43,256 --> 01:29:45,406
-Well, I don't understand.
-Yes, you do.

1365
01:29:45,576 --> 01:29:48,454
You don't really want to buy
this antiquated tomb.

1366
01:29:48,616 --> 01:29:50,447
You'd be out of your mind.

1367
01:29:50,616 --> 01:29:54,894
I don't know. It isn't such a bad
house. Remodeling would do wonders.

1368
01:29:55,536 --> 01:29:59,211
Take off some of that gingerbread
and redecorate the inside and--

1369
01:30:00,736 --> 01:30:03,204
My businesslike air
isn't fooling you much, is it?

1370
01:30:03,696 --> 01:30:08,850
No, I remember too well. I remember
how it was with us once, and so do you.

1371
01:30:09,016 --> 01:30:11,166
It isn't something either of us
can forget.

1372
01:30:11,336 --> 01:30:13,850
-You haven't forgotten?
-Not for an hour.

1373
01:30:14,016 --> 01:30:18,009
-Even this doesn't help.
-Then you can do me a great kindness.

1374
01:30:18,176 --> 01:30:21,771
-lf I can.
-Ask me to marry you.

1375
01:30:23,696 --> 01:30:25,414
Why?

1376
01:30:25,896 --> 01:30:29,366
I must say, your attitude isn't
exactly enthusiastic.

1377
01:30:29,536 --> 01:30:32,289
You went to considerable trouble
to get rid of me once so naturally. . .

1378
01:30:32,456 --> 01:30:37,576
. . .I'm startled by your proposal
of marriage. This is a little sudden.

1379
01:30:37,736 --> 01:30:40,409
I have my own reason
for wanting to marry you.

1380
01:30:40,576 --> 01:30:42,771
-A reason named Veda.
-Why should it be?

1381
01:30:42,936 --> 01:30:46,724
Because your reason for doing anything
is usually Veda.

1382
01:30:46,896 --> 01:30:51,094
Well, whether it is or isn't,
what's your answer?

1383
01:30:51,256 --> 01:30:54,566
I can't afford you.
You have money, and I haven't.

1384
01:30:54,736 --> 01:30:58,411
All I have is pride and a name,
and I can't sell either.

1385
01:30:58,576 --> 01:31:00,931
-I see.
-I'm not enjoying this.

1386
01:31:01,096 --> 01:31:04,247
Things are very different now
from the way they were.

1387
01:31:04,416 --> 01:31:08,455
-I know. I haven't forgotten.
-Neither have I.

1388
01:31:08,616 --> 01:31:11,050
I want you to love me again
the way you did then.

1389
01:31:11,216 --> 01:31:13,286
I need that more than anything else.

1390
01:31:13,456 --> 01:31:17,290
I told you then you were
the only woman in the world for me.

1391
01:31:17,456 --> 01:31:20,129
-I loved you then, and I love you now.
-Then why--?

1392
01:31:20,296 --> 01:31:24,528
I can't marry you. I won't go on
taking tips from you as I used to.

1393
01:31:24,696 --> 01:31:27,688
Of course, if I owned a share
in your business--

1394
01:31:28,696 --> 01:31:32,735
Oh, I see. I think I understand now.

1395
01:31:33,976 --> 01:31:36,171
How much of a share
would your pride require?

1396
01:31:36,336 --> 01:31:39,055
Please don't put it that way.
It hurts me to do this.

1397
01:31:39,216 --> 01:31:42,094
-I'm doing it--
-How much of a share?

1398
01:31:42,256 --> 01:31:43,974
One-third.

1399
01:31:46,336 --> 01:31:48,088
All right.

1400
01:31:48,256 --> 01:31:50,087
Sold.

1401
01:31:50,256 --> 01:31:52,406
One Beragon.

1402
01:32:08,336 --> 01:32:10,406
-Hello, Lottie.
-Why, Mr. Pierce.

1403
01:32:10,576 --> 01:32:13,010
Is Mrs. Pierce--?
Mrs. Beragon, is she in?

1404
01:32:13,176 --> 01:32:17,135
She's in there.
I mean, this way, please.

1405
01:32:17,296 --> 01:32:20,288
-Thank you.
-It's nice to see you again.

1406
01:32:20,456 --> 01:32:25,052
-It's nice to see you, Lottie.
-It's been such a long time. Follow me.

1407
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:30,085
Oh, no, no, no. I'm supposed to announce
everybody. You stay there. Pardon, please.

1408
01:32:30,256 --> 01:32:31,655
Please pardon.

1409
01:32:35,056 --> 01:32:37,445
Mr. Albert Pierce!

1410
01:32:40,656 --> 01:32:42,089
[WHISPERS]
Lottie, not so loud.

1411
01:32:42,256 --> 01:32:45,532
-No?
-Hello, Bert. It's nice to see you.

1412
01:32:45,696 --> 01:32:49,052
Thanks. I thought I'd drop in.
I hope you don't mind.

1413
01:32:49,216 --> 01:32:51,684
Of course not. Come in, sit down.

1414
01:32:51,856 --> 01:32:53,209
-Want a drink?
-No, thanks.

1415
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:56,732
-My hours are too long these days.
-Let's sit over here.

1416
01:32:56,896 --> 01:33:00,172
-This is quite a nifty place.
-We just finished redecorating.

1417
01:33:00,336 --> 01:33:03,134
-You didn't come to the wedding.
-I read about it.

1418
01:33:03,296 --> 01:33:06,527
It was informal.
Just Monte's family and friends.

1419
01:33:06,816 --> 01:33:12,413
I probably have a lot of nerve to ask
this, but do you really love this guy?

1420
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:16,012
-I married him, didn't I?
-That doesn't answer my question.

1421
01:33:16,176 --> 01:33:19,248
-Monte's okay.
-That still doesn't answer me.

1422
01:33:19,416 --> 01:33:21,566
Are you in love with this guy?

1423
01:33:23,336 --> 01:33:24,689
No, Bert.

1424
01:33:25,816 --> 01:33:30,685
I'm not exactly in love with him.
But Monte and I understand each other.

1425
01:33:30,856 --> 01:33:35,293
I thought if I moved from that
other house and fixed this place up. . .

1426
01:33:35,456 --> 01:33:38,175
-. . .I thought, maybe--
-Veda would come back.

1427
01:33:38,336 --> 01:33:40,691
I thought that was why.

1428
01:33:40,856 --> 01:33:44,485
I know you think I'm a fool, Bert.
But I can't help it.

1429
01:33:44,656 --> 01:33:49,525
I'd do anything to get her back. I couldn't
leave her where she was, could I?

1430
01:33:49,696 --> 01:33:51,652
No, I guess not.

1431
01:33:51,816 --> 01:33:54,535
Anyhow, that's all I wanted to know.

1432
01:33:54,696 --> 01:33:57,290
I guess we'll always fight about her.

1433
01:33:58,496 --> 01:34:01,249
Mildred,
I brought you a wedding present.

1434
01:34:01,416 --> 01:34:03,054
A wedding present?

1435
01:34:03,216 --> 01:34:05,446
Take a look out that window.

1436
01:34:20,896 --> 01:34:25,287
-Bert! Did you ask her to come?
-No. She called me up.

1437
01:34:25,456 --> 01:34:29,051
She pretended it was something
else. But I got the truth out of her.

1438
01:34:29,216 --> 01:34:31,810
She wanted to come home, Mildred.

1439
01:34:31,976 --> 01:34:34,092
Tell her to come in.

1440
01:34:59,056 --> 01:35:00,091
Veda.

1441
01:35:12,536 --> 01:35:15,209
I wanted to come home weeks ago.

1442
01:35:15,376 --> 01:35:18,095
When it was Christmas,
I couldn't stay away.

1443
01:35:18,256 --> 01:35:22,568
-I'm so glad, darling.
-I'll change, Mother. I promise.

1444
01:35:22,736 --> 01:35:28,174
-I'll never say mean things to you again.
-I said mean things too.

1445
01:35:30,416 --> 01:35:33,294
-Mother, this is a beautiful place.
-Oh, Bert.

1446
01:35:33,456 --> 01:35:35,845
I forgot to thank your father.

1447
01:35:37,936 --> 01:35:41,406
-Bert, I'm very grateful.
-That's all right, Mildred.

1448
01:35:41,576 --> 01:35:45,125
I don't believe it.
I simply don't believe it.

1449
01:35:45,296 --> 01:35:49,289
