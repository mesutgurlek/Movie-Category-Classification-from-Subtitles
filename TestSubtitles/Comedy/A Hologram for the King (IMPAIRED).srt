Yours, Alan."

"Dear Alan, I actually
might have left something.

1092
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:27,045
I'm thinking a sponge? Or maybe part
of a snack I ate during the surgery.

1093
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:29,325
I think I need to see you again.

1094
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:31,125
Perhaps out of the hospital?

"Dear Zahra, that's a very good idea.

1099
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:48,405
But to tell you the truth,
I have no idea how this is done in the KSA.

1100
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:53,685
I mean Mr. Alan Clay meeting
Dr. Zahra Hakem outside of the hospital.

1101

And I hope it doesn't appear too
inappropriate to ask you for advice."

ZAHRA:
"I'll pick you up on Wednesday at noon.

I'll write your initials on a card

and put it on the windshield."

- How are you today?
- Great, great. How are you?

1106
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:38,481
Very good. Water?

1107
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:59,005
- I still need to apologize.
- For what?

1108
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:02,525
The other day. I invaded your privacy.

1109
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:06,045
Oh. Those were
unforeseeable circumstances.

1110
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:08,600
- You seemed troubled.
- I was.

1111
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:10,921
I'm having legal issues with my husband.

1112
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,480
We're getting divorced. It's ugly.

01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:15,927
I had just returned
from court that morning.

And is it all sorted out now?

It will be soon, I think.

1116

It's in his hands, unfortunately.

1117
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:26,283
- You mean legally?
- Yes.

1118

Divorce is complicated in this country.

1119

It's pretty complicated in all countries.

- I have children.

- I assumed. Me, too.
- You assumed?

1124
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:53,845
Well, maybe not assumed.
I assumed it was possible.

1125
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:56,725
I thought you meant
you saw something in my hips.

You know, the way people can see
from the way a woman walks.

Oh, I'm not that clever.

- Well, they're teenagers now. They live with me.
- What are their names?

Rania, she's 14, Mustafa, he's 15.

I'm trying to prevent him from becoming
an asshole like his father.

Any advice?

1132
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:22,607
- Does he tell you anything?
- Did you tell your mother anything?

1133
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:30,164
Get him alone somewhere.
Something like camping.

Kit. She's 21.

- Does she tell you anything?
- She does.

1140
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:53,362
But I'm not sure...

1141
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:58,406
- About what?
- Whether I'm helping.

1142
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:03,403
Does she call you sometimes
with no particular agenda?

1143
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:08,042
- Yeah.
- Then you're good.

1144
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:14,245
What do you think our kids
would make of this?

1145
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:16,205
How do you mean? You and me?

1146
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:18,885
- The big culture clash?
- I guess so.

1147

Please. We're separated
by the thinnest filament.

Well, that's the way I think.

1149
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:26,450
That's the way it is.

1150
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:44,604
- Wow.
- Yes.

Let me take your jacket.

Everyone wants to be somewhere else.

1155

It's horrible, isn't it?

1156
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:21,365
My brother buys paintings
wherever he goes.

1157
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:22,965
He has the worst taste.

1158

- Time to swim.
- Time to swim?

1159
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:31,441
We're going swimming.
You'll borrow my brother's suit.

1160
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:55,090
- You ready?
- I'm ready.

1161
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:01,285
You go in. I'll follow.

1162
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:25,721
- Sorry.
- Oh!

1163
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:27,445
Sorry.

1164
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:30,364
- I didn't mean to scare you.
- It's all right.

1165
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:35,683
I have to get under. Neighbors.

1166
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:40,120
I must warn you, though.
I'm dressed like you.

1167
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:42,765
So if someone sees us snorkeling,
they'll think it's two men.

1168
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:48,722
Just two backs uncovered wearing
men's trunks. You understand?

1169
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:53,125
Wow.

1170
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:55,680
Ah. Yeah.

1171
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:04,369
What now?

1172
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:08,688
Take a deep breath.
And then let it out slowly.

1173
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:00,250
It's been a long time.

1174
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:05,125
Yeah. Same here.

1175
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:07,446
How long?

1176
01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:11,451
I don't know.

1177
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:15,807
Me neither. I can hardly remember.

1178
01:27:57,720 --> 01:28:00,085
I have a story.

1179
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:03,562
I've been thinking about it
since we spoke about your son.

1180
01:28:03,640 --> 01:28:05,688
Ah, please, tell me.

1181
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:09,009
My father and I...

1182
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:11,445
went camping a few times.

1183
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:16,162
- Camping again?
- This is not about camping.

1184
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:19,406
I was eleven or twelve.

1185
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:23,730
Yeah, this one time,
he brought me up to New Hampshire.

1186
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:26,485
It was cold,

1187
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:27,965
'cause it had snowed a week before.

1188
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:30,281
And we drove into this national park.

1189
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:34,160
And we parked and we walked
deep into the woods

1190
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:36,720
for four hours, at least.

1191
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:41,445
And the sun was already falling,
so we stopped.

1192
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:45,605
No sign of any civilization
in any direction.

1193
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:47,325
I thought he had a plan, you know,

1194
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:51,041
but he acted like he had just
figured out the math of it all...

1195
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:53,085
that we weren't gonna get back before dark

1196
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:55,205
and the night would freeze us solid.

1197
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:58,965
Not to mention the prospect
of wolves, bears.

1198
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:01,565
- Wolves and bears?
- Yeah.

1199
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:05,281
So he asked me, "What should we do, son?"

1200
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:08,643
And I realized
this was some kind of a test,

1201
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:12,765
so I thought of all
the Boy Scout stuff I knew

1202
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:16,287
and I said, "Build a shelter?"

1203
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:20,927
So we got started and we took
turns chopping and tying.

1204
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:24,362
We set it up there,
a perfectly respectable A-frame.

1205
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:28,081
We collected fronds from the pine trees
and lined the bottom with them.

1206
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:33,005
And he says, "Alan, what do we need now?"

1207
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:37,765
And I knew. We needed a needle and thread.

1208
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:40,805
Or... duct tape.

1209
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:42,005
For what?

1210
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:45,323
To make a sleeping bag out of our clothes.

1211
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:49,885
We cut up our jackets and we taped them
together and made a big, wide sleeping bag.

1212
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:53,282
And we slept there in our long underwear.

1213
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:58,002
- And you shared the sleeping bag?
- We did.

1214
01:29:58,120 --> 01:30:03,160
And I must say,
when we were all settled in there,

1215
01:30:03,240 --> 01:30:04,365
it was really warm.

1216
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:07,091
And you didn't have a fire?

1217
01:30:08,120 --> 01:30:10,521
No fire. Just each other.

1218
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:14,370
And in the morning?

1219
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:18,404
We taped our jackets back
together and went home.

1220

ALAN: Hey, Kit.

1223
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:45,884
I'm writing to tell you
that I'm postponing

1224
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:50,885
my return to the United States
and I don't know for how long.

1225
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:54,802
The deal I was working on
here in Jeddah didn't happen.

1226
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:59,924
A competitor from China offered
the same technology a lot faster

1227
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,605
and at half the price.

1228
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:08,286
I shouldn't have been surprised,
but there I was, surprised.

1229
01:31:09,480 --> 01:31:13,765
So, Kit, the money part
of our lives is not solved just yet,

1230
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:15,285
but I'm working on it.

1231
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:19,162
I've taken a new job here
which pays pretty well.

1232
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:23,564
It should be enough even to get you
back into school next semester.

1233
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:29,925
Keep believing, Kit,
'cause I believe in you.

1234
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:34,845
You're strong and young and you have time.

1235
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:38,045
I'm not so young, but I have to tell you,

1236
01:31:38,120 --> 01:31:40,085
there's a force in my life now

1237
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:43,403
that makes me feel strong again.

1238
01:31:43,480 --> 01:31:46,450
And I feel that there's time.

1239
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:50,047
There must be time.
