Mine arejust fi ne. [br]Look,

149
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,900
I'm just saying that[br]college might be[br]less ofa shock...

150
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,200
ifyou take an extra lab[br]or language course[br]or something.

151
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:36,400
- What do you think? [br]- Will Advanced Chem[br]get you off my back?

152
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,700
Not completely, [br]but it'll help.

153
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,700
Done.

154
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,100
You know, mothers have killed[br]to get their daughters[br]on squads.

155
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,200
That mother[br]didn't kill anyone. [br]She hired a hit man.

[Punk]

157
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,200
Everyone, we have[br]a new student...

Wait, wait, wait. [br]Was that, uh...

165
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,500
Was that the loser sneeze[br]I just heard right there?

166
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,300
Guys, come on. [br]I mean, what is that, [br]from like the 1900s?

167
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,200
Nobody does that anymore. [br]I don't think anybody does.

168
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,200
When I lived in Kentucky... [br]Did they still do[br]the loser sneeze in Kentucky?

169
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,900
No. They had, uh, [br]guns and homemade bombs.

170
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
What about L.A.? [br]There wasattitude in L.A., [br]but no losersneeze.

171
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,100
I'm pretty sure[br]the loser sneeze[br]is officially dead.

172
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,100
Sorry.

Nice.

175
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,100
I don't think[br]they got the memo[br]about the loser sneeze.

176
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,100
Uh, no, apparently not.

Yikes. [br]Um, 'fraid so. [br]Are you intimidated?

180
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,200
Y-Yeah, a little.

181
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,900
- Really? [br]- No, not really.

182
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,200
So, is that your band[br]or something?

183
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,700
The Clash? No, uh...

184
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:36,600
It's a British punk band, [br]circa 1977 to 1983-ish.

185
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,700
- Original lineup, anyway. [br]- How vintage.

Um, so I'll[br]seeyou aroundthen?

00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,700
Looks like it.

189
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,100
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

190
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,400
Whoa! It's sexy Leslie...

191
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,200
and Jan, Jan, [br]the cheerleading man. [br]Hey, fags.

192
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,200
Just because we won[br]more trophies[br]than you guys,

193
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,400
that's no reason[br]to go get all malignant.

194
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,900
Malignant this, tool. [br][Laughing]

195
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,500
All right. [br]Right on!

196
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,400
One ofthese days, man. [br]Let it go.

197
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,400
They never even won[br]a single game.

198
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,900
Gotta be kind[br]of rough on 'em. [br]Besides, they're dicks.

199
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,100
Les, tell me you have[br]Advanced Chem[br]fi rst period.

200
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,500
Advanced Chem, fi rst period. [br]lfyou have a lab partner[br]already, I'm screwed.

201
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,400
Torrance, it's only[br]the second day ofschool,

202
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,500
and your academic[br]insecurity bit[br]is completely tired.

203
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,700
You know, everyone's[br]saying your ambition[br]broke Carver's leg.

204
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,600
When, really, it was[br]the ankle she slammed[br]into the ground.

205
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,400
Kasey did a massive[br]E-mail last night. [br]Misspelled "leg."

206
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,100
Shut up! [br]Two G's.

207
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,600
Apparently, Carver[br]gets home schooling[br]for the next three months.

208
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,500
I'm cursed. [br]Replacing her is[br]gonna be a nightmare.

209
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,700
Well, that's why you're[br]the captain, Captain.

210
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:50,900
Bring on the tyros, [br]the neophytes[br]and the dilettanti.

211

Bring on the tyros, [br]the neophytes[br]and the dilettanti.

212
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:57,000
S.A.T. 's are over, Darcy. [br]And you're still jealous[br]of my score.

213
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,900
Are we sure Carver's[br]not malingering?

214
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,900
Carver will strictly be[br]cheering in Special Olympics[br]until March.

215
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,800
Nationals are February 10th.

216
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,800
Regionals are in, like, [br]four weeks. I talked to her. [br]She's cool with this.

217
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:10,100
Don't tell me Carver can[br]cut school just because she[br]broke her leg in three places.

218
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,300
Hello! [br]Get a wheelchair! [br]That lucky bitch.

219
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,600
Tell me we're not actually[br]continuing this masquerade[br]and having tryouts.

220
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,300
Let's cut the crap[br]and pick somebody now.

221
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,700
Whitney's little sisterJamie[br]is really teeny.

222
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,600
She'll be easy to toss, [br]and she doesn't give lip.

223
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,900
Just tongue. [br]Kiss my ass, Jan.

224

Big Red totally screwed us!

445
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,000
I mean monster screwed us!

446
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:51,200
I put this to the entire squad. [br]Swearyou guys didn't know.

447
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,200
Big Red didn't exactly[br]let any of us help with[br]the routines, Torrance.

448
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:57,900
- I cannot believe she did this. [br]- I feel awful. It's depraved.

449
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,400
I mean, those East Compton girls[br]wanted to grill our asses.

450
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:05,100
Big Redran theshow, man. [br]We werejust flying ignorami, [br]forsobbing out loud.

451
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,600
We can't go to regionals[br]with a stolen routine.

452
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,100
It's too risky. [br][Whitney][br]Changing the routine now...

453
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:13,100
would be total[br]murder-suicide. [br]Seriously.

454
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,700
Let's not put[br]the "duh" in "dumb."

455
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,700
How are East Compton[br]gonna prove anything?

456
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:21,400
You people are unbelievable. [br]I mean, we're talking about[br]cheating here.

457
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,100
Sorry, new girl, [br]but nobody hit your buzzer.

458
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:28,500
Look, lhate to bepredictable, [br]but Idon't give a shit.

459
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:32,600
We learned that routine[br]fair and square. [br]We logged the man-hours.

460
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:36,600
Don't punish the squad[br]for Big Red's mistake.

461
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:39,100
This isn't about cheating.

462
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,300
This is about winning. [br]Everyone in favor ofwinning?

463
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:56,100
Iget whatyou're saying, [br]Missy, but there's no time.

464
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,400
lfwe don't do the routine, [br]we've got nothing else.

465
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,300
So, you in?

466
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,300
Whatever.

474
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,700
It's not my fault you're in love[br]with a big gay cheerleader who[br]won't return your phone calls.

475
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:42,500
- Aaron is not gay. [br]- Oh, so someonejust made him[br]become a cheerleader?

476
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,500
He'sjust... busy!

477
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,600
Yeah, busy[br]scamming on guys.

478

Good. We gotta start early. [br]You'll be a star[br]cheerleaderyet.

493
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:40,300
All the cheerleaders[br]in the world wouldn't[br]help our football team.

494
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,700
Man, it'sjust wrong. [br]Cheering for them[br]isjust plain mean.

495
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,600
Everybody comes[br]to see you ladies, [br]anyway.

Because we're[br]such fi ne athletes. [br]Oh, live with it.

What is your sexuality?

Courtney doesn't[br]wear anything[br]under her spankies.

That's[br]no excuse, Jan.

I can't help it[br]if my digits slip[br]occasionally.

Obviously your Toros[br]aren't the only squad with[br]this particular routine.

We really should[br]disqualify you and... [br]No, don't punish the squad.

866
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,900
It was my choice[br]to hire Sparky, not theirs.

867
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:07,100
Don't penalize everyone[br]for my bad judgment.

868
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,500
But since there's[br]no precedent for this,

869
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,500
there's nothing[br]in the rule books[br]that forbids it.

870
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:13,500
It's simply frowned upon,

871
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:16,100
and I suppose[br]we can't disqualify you[br]on those grounds alone.

872
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,700
As defending champions, [br]you are guaranteed[br]a bid to Florida,

Look, the truth is[br]I was a real leader, okay?

883
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:48,500
I did what I had to do[br]to win at nationals,

884
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:52,600
and ever since I handed[br]the reins over to you, you've run[br]my squad into the ground!

00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:24,900
It's been[br]a rough transition, [br]for both of us.

894
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,600
But I still care about you[br]as much as I ever did. [br]You know that, right?

895
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:30,300
You do? [br]Ofcourse.

896
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,200
Which is why I hate[br]to see you like this, [br]all stressed out.

897
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:35,100
It's not good foryou.

898
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:38,100
You're a great cheerleader, [br]Tor, and you're cute as hell.

899
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:42,700
It'sjust that maybe... [br][Sighs]

900
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:47,800
Maybe...

901
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:49,800
you'rejust not[br]captain material,

902
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:52,100
and there's nothing[br]wrong with that.

903
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:55,600
Maybe you should consider[br]letting Courtney and Whitney[br]take over the squad.

904
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:59,100
They'rejust like Big Red. [br]You want me[br]to give up captain?

905
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:01,300
Hey, let them deal[br]with the politics.

906
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:04,900
You just do[br]what you do best, Tor. [br]You cheer.

907
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:08,300
Cheer, Tor. Okay?

908
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:11,700
I just wanna see you happy.

909
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:27,700
Bye. [br]Mm.

910
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:30,600
Mmm.

911
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,500
Sleep tight, sweetie.

912
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:53,300
[Sighs]

913
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:59,100
Friend ofyours?

914
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,200
He's my boyfriend.

915
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:05,300
Look, Cliff, [br]I can explain.

916
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:07,200
No. It's cool.

917
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,700
Here, um, [br]I made you a tape too.

918
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:20,700
Cliff...

919
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:55,800
Hey, Torrance, uh, [br]it's me, Cliff.

920
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:57,900
Um, here's, uh...

921
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,500
I wrotesomething, uh, [br]foryou, so here it is. [br][Clears Throat]

922
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:04,100
Oh, Torrance

923
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:07,200
Can't stand[br]yourcheerleading squad

924
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:10,500

925
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:15,100

926
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:18,000
One, two, three, four! [br][HardRock]

927
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:24,700
Yeah, yougot me to feel[br]all those butterflies inside

928
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:27,600

929
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:30,000

931
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:34,700
I'dbringyou flowers[br]everyday

932
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:37,300
Just to rollyou[br]in the hay

933
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:39,800
Well, I'm feelin 'fine[br]I'm right on time

934
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:43,400
Iknowl'llget my way

935
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:45,900
Andyou'rejust[br]what Ineed

936
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,200
Andyou'rejust[br]what Ineed

937
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:51,000
Not everything[br]works asit seems

938
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:53,700
Is thatso hard[br]to believe

939
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:55,700
'Causeyou'rejust[br]what Ineed

940
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:58,700
Andyou'rejust[br]what Ineed

941
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:00,500
Not everything[br]works asit seems

942
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:03,400
Is thatso hard[br]to believe

943
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:05,000
Yeah

944
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:13,600
[Sighs][br]Aaron called us[br]last night.

945
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:16,300
He told us[br]you're turning[br]the squad over to us.

946
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,900
Just because you bit[br]the big one as captain,

947
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,300
does not mean[br]we're gonna be[br]super hard on you.

948
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,300
Oh. [br]We'll treat you[br]as ifyou...

949
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:25,200
didn't screw us[br]into the ground.

950
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:27,400
Gee, thanks. [br]Everyone.

951
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:30,100
Torrance is not[br]to be harmed.

952
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:32,400
We've already decided[br]on a course ofaction.

953
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:34,400
We're gonna forego[br]nationals this year.

954
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:37,000
- [Sighs][br]- [Whitney] Everyone's[br]already agreedto it.

955
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:38,600
Uh, except me. [br]And me!

956
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:41,900
- Both ofyou can be replaced. [br]- [Torrance][br]lcan't believeyouguys.

957
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,600
The onlyperson who can[br]officially resign thepost[br]ofcaptain is the captain,

958
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:47,700
and I'm not[br]going anywhere.

959
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:49,800
Then we'll have[br]to overthrow you. [br]Which we will!

960
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:51,600
Enough!

961
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:55,800
Our whole cheering career, [br]we've stakedourreputation[br]on being the best,

962
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:57,700
the most inventive.

963
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:02,800
Now we fi nally have a chance[br]to truly be original, [br]and you're all running scared.

964
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:06,300
[Courtney][br]She's crazy. [br]lam not crazy,

965
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,200
and I'm not resigning[br]as captain either.

966
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:10,800
- You're gonna have[br]to kill me fi rst. [br]- That can be arranged.

967
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:12,800
Shut it, Whitney! [br]Let her talk!

968
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:17,300
Look, lknowl've screwedup[br]royally as captain,

969
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:20,700
but lbelieve in this squad, [br]andlknow we can[br]bounce backfrom this.

970
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:24,900
I'm not saying[br]it's gonna be easy. [br]It's gonna be hard work.

971
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:28,500
We need a new routine, [br]something amazing and fresh,

972
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:31,500
and we've got less than[br]three weeks till nationals,

973
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:34,500
but ifwe can do it, [br]ifwe can pull this off,

974
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:37,300
then we can really[br]call ourselves original.

975
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:39,200
Now who's with me?

976
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:40,900
All right! [br]Yeah. [br]Yeah!

977
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,800
Yeah!

978
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:45,500
How 'bout it, girls? [br]It's gonna be hard[br]without you two.

979
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:48,100
[Sighs][br]Fine.

980
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:51,500
Sure. [br]Whatever.

981
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:54,000
Okay. Let's do this.

982
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:57,600
[Torrance][br]We're gonna devote[br]every waking hourtopractice...

983
01:03:57,700 --> 01:04:00,200
before school, [br]in between classes[br]andafterschool.

984
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:03,300
Afternoonpractices[br]willhave to be twice aslong.

985
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:07,000
We've gotta do[br]whateverit takes to be[br]in perfectphysicalshape.

986
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:08,900
Yeah. You can go[br]a little harder.

987
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:13,300
Yeah, that feelsgood. [br]Maybe we should[br]join the squad.

988
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:15,700
Push. [br]Oh, yeah. [br]Fag!

989
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:21,900
[Torrance] Andsince[br]the football team sucks[br]no matterhowhard we cheer,

990
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,900
we'll use nightgames[br]topractice too.

991
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,500
But that's not all.

992
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:29,700
We're gonna study[br]othertypes ofmovement, [br]from swing dance...

993
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:33,300
to interpretive dance, [br]... you grow and you[br]grow and you bloom!

994
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:36,200
even mime.

995
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:38,300
We'lldrawinspiration[br]from martialarts, [br]Hah!

996
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:40,900
musicals, everything.

997
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:45,500
Youguys know[br]we've got the talent.

998
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:51,300
We'vejustgotta work ourasses[br]offandtrust ourinstincts... [br]all ofourinstincts.

999

[LoudRock][br][Aluminum Can[br]Clattering]

1000
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:03,200
Tor! Wha... Wow! [br]What are you doing here?

1001
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:06,100
Just wanted to[br]come by and see you. [br]Is this a bad time?

1002
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:08,000
Yeah. [br]Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1003
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:10,300
I'm super busy. [br]I'm workin'[br]on this project...

1004
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:12,300
Yeah, you sound super busy.

1005
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:15,900
I guess that's it. [br]You were too busy[br]to believe in me.

1006
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,800
Oh. No, no, but wait.

1007
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:20,500
You weren't too busy[br]to sell me out to Courtney[br]and Whitney, were you?

1008
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:23,300
Gee, now I'm confused.

1009
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:27,500
Well, I hope you're not[br]too busy to hear this.

1010
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:30,300

You're a great[br]cheerleader, Aaron.

1013
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:39,800
It'sjust that...

1014
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:42,700
maybe you're not exactly[br]boyfriend material.

1015
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:45,100
Bye-bye.

1016
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:49,300
You're a cheerleader? [br][Disgusted Sigh]

1017
01:05:57,600 --> 01:06:01,900
U.C.A. just posted the nationals[br]list on the Internet. [br]East Compton isn't on it.

1018
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:03,900
They couldn 't raise[br]the money in time.

1019
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,100
- They're not going. [br]- What do you mean, [br]"They're not going"?

1020
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:09,500
Torrance, [br]that'sgoodnews.

1021
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:11,500
They cannot not go. [br]That's not good news.

1022
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:14,800
What are you talking about? [br]They don't go, we win. [br]Once again we're the best.

1023
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:18,500
I defi ne best as competing[br]against the best there is[br]out there and beating them.

1024
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:21,700
- They have to go. [br]- [Sighs]

1025
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:26,400
It's so unfair. The fi rst[br]inner-city squad to get a bid, [br]and they can't afford to go?

1026
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:29,700
Look, Mom. Her head is spinning[br]off into another dimension. [br]Justin!

1027
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:33,000
The company gets hit up[br]for money all the time, honey. [br]I just can't.

1028
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:35,600
It's not that much money, [br]Mr. Level-Playing-Field.

1029
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:37,700
Tell them the deal. [br]Maybe they'll wanna help.

1030
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:39,900
Yeah? Okay, [br]I'll make the call,

1031
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:41,900
but they'll probably[br]say no.

1032
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,100
Don't let them. [br]Think of how much[br]it'll mean to East Compton.

1033
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:47,000
They deserve to go.

1034
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:49,800
Do the right thing, Dad!

1035
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:56,600
Did that[br]just happen? [br]Yeah.

1036
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:59,300
"Where we come from, [br]'cheer' is not a word[br]we hear very often."

1037
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:02,100
"They should call us[br]'inspiration leaders'[br]instead."

1038
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:04,200
Oh, that's deep. [br]I like that.

1039
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:06,200
