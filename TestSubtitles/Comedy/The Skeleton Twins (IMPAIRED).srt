Mm.

Maggie, this was just
some stupid thing I did.

80
00:05:48,082 --> 00:05:50,816
I was drunk and feeling
melodramatic, so...

<i>you didn't
have to come here.</i>

82

I get discharged today.

They just called me a cab.
I thought you were going home.

88
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,637
Why, because
you told me to?

89

<i>No, because
I asked you to.</i>

90

So, what, are you
king of the hospital now?

91
00:06:58,652 --> 00:07:02,053
( sighs )
Have you read
"Marley and Me"?

92
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:04,055
Yeah, sad.

93
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:05,557
Why is it sad?

94
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:07,559
You don't
know what happens?

95
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:09,194
No, that's why
I'm reading it.

Oh, sorry.

97
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:14,466
- What?
- Nothing.

98
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:16,168
- What, does
the dog die at the end?
- No, I didn't say that.

99
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,769
The fucking dog
dies at the end.

100
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,037
I didn't... I'm not
saying anything.

101
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,539
Look how much
I had left.

102
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,507
- ( book thuds )
- ( groans )

103
00:07:24,178 --> 00:07:27,145
I'm sorry I ruined it.
( chuckles )

104
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:31,483
Maggie,
I know the dog dies.

105

<i>Everyone knows
the dog dies.</i>

106
00:07:33,187 --> 00:07:35,587
It's the book
where the dog dies.

107
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:39,791
Asshole.

108

<i>I see you're getting
your sense of humor back.</i>

Yeah, they can't
take that away from me.

110
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:51,603
I was thinking, um...

111

maybe you'd wanna
come stay with me?

112

I mean just
for a little bit,
until you feel better.

115
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:02,948
I have a guest room

finally.

116
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:06,585
Nyack's really beautiful
this time of year.

117
00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:10,055
So the crack team of
hospital crisis counselors
got to you too, huh?

118
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:12,190
This was my decision.

119
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:14,759
Yeah, whatever.
They guilted you
into this.

120
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:18,730
You're right.
It's probably a bad idea.

Hey, here he is.

128

- Yeah, sure am.

129

- Great to meet you.
Oh, shit. Sorry, man.

It's okay.
Don't worry about it.

I'm so psyched

133
00:09:31,672 --> 00:09:33,738
Yeah, you, too.

Mysterious Milo

135
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,677
Well, actually,
I'm clothed now,

136
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:41,246
so you'll have
to get to know me
a little bit better

137
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:42,747
before you see me

I'm just...
I'm doing a few chores.

142
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:55,093
I will, I will, thank you.
Thanks for having me.

143
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:57,062
Okay,
take it easy, amigo.

144
00:09:57,064 --> 00:09:59,130
Y-you, too, amigo.

145

Jesus, Maggie.

146
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:14,613
So, Milo, you hear about
your wild and crazy sister?

147
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:16,615
Are you...
he doesn't know?

148

Your wild and crazy sister

149
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,919
- Mm.

Come on, louder.

Scuba diving lessons.

- Yeah.
- Doesn't that
sound like fun?

153
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:30,795
Yeah, if you like
scuba diving, yeah.

154
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,631
I do.

155

00:10:34,368 --> 00:10:35,767
It's gonna
be badass.

157
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:37,769
Honeymoon?

158
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:39,170
Better two years
late than never.

159
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:41,172
It was her idea.
It was your idea.

160
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:43,274
- Better late than never.
- Yeah.

161
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:45,176
<i>She's always
getting crazy ideas.</i>

162
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:47,379
Last month,
it was salsa dancing.

163
00:10:47,381 --> 00:10:49,080
Have you ever heard
of salsa dancing?

164
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:50,749
It's kind of like
a Spanish-flavored
dancing?

165
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:53,785
Yeah, yeah,
the... the... yeah.

166
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:55,654
- So now it's scuba diving.
- Yeah.

167
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:58,890
- You ever been?
- Uh, no, no.

168
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:01,726
- Dude, you'd love it.
It's awesome.
- Right.

169
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:04,663
<i>Me and my buddy Craig,</i>
<i>a couple years ago,</i>
<i>we went to Costa Rica.</i>

170
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:07,999
This was before Maggie
was on the scene...
PM, pre-Maggie...

171
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:11,403
and the first time
we go out on a dive,

172
00:11:11,405 --> 00:11:15,874
we saw an effing sea turtle,
which is very rare.

173
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:19,344
- Incredibly rare.
- I think it's pretty normal...
right? Seeing sea turtles?

174
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,413
- Lance:<i> What?</i>
- When you're diving,
seeing sea turtles?

175
00:11:21,415 --> 00:11:23,415
- I think that's very...
- No, I think you're thinking of
just, like, regular turtles

176
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:25,717
that you'd see
in a pond or a stream.

177
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:28,853
I'm talking about
a sea turtle in the wild.

178
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:31,289
<i>We were swimming so close</i>
<i>to it that you could</i>
<i>practically touch it.</i>

179
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,358
Mm-hmm.

180
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,260
Is it okay
if I tell him?
Can I?

181
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:38,697
- Nothing really to tell yet.
- You ready for some big news?

182
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:40,965
We're trying
to get pregnant.

183
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:43,468
- Really?
- We are trying
to get pregnant.

184
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:47,439
- Yep.
- And I say "we are," because
it's not sexist that way.

185
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:49,240
- Right? That's what
you told me.
- Yeah.

186
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:51,376
I thought you never
wanted to have kids.

187
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:54,412
Well, I may have said that
in high school or something,

188
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:56,781
but obviously people
change their minds on that.

189
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:58,450
No, I... that's great.

190
00:11:58,452 --> 00:12:00,218
I love kids.

191
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,786
Except the fat ones.

192
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:03,488
Fuck those
little turds, right?

193
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:06,991
He's kidding.
He's being a smartass.

194
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:08,760
- Don't mind him.
- I'm messing with you.

195
00:12:08,762 --> 00:12:10,328
I was like, "Whoa, what's
this guy got against fat kids?"

196
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,297
- No, he's...
- I mean, I was a fat kid.

197
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:14,232
-<i> Oh, you were?</i>
- I was built like
a damn tank, yeah.

198
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,401
- She's seen the pictures.
- It's pretty cute, though.

199
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,369
I look like a...
just a little pillow
with legs.

200
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:19,370
- A little marshmallow.
- Yeah.

201
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:21,239
Hey, here's to you guys.

202
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,774
Thanks.

203
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:25,110
May your kids
be happy and fat.

204
00:12:25,112 --> 00:12:26,344
Cool, man, thanks.

205
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:27,746
I mean, it hasn't
happened yet,

206
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:29,180
but we're definitely
giving it a go.

207
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:31,249
Well, keep trying, guys.

208
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,118
I can't wait to be
the creepy gay uncle.

209
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,253
- You're hired.
- Okay.

210
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:38,156
- You got the job.
- ( chuckles )

211
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:41,059
( knocks )

212
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:42,794
- Hey.
- Hey.

213
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:44,929
- Settling in?
- Yeah.

214
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:47,899
No, yeah, it's like
a Martha Stewart wonderland.

215
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:52,437
So, you met Lance.

216
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:55,206
Yeah, I met Lance.

217
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,242
Isn't he the best?

218
00:12:57,244 --> 00:13:00,145
Yeah, he's like
a big Labrador retriever.

219
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:03,381
Yeah, I guess.

220
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:06,417
He's just the nicest guy
on the planet.

221
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:08,820
I really lucked out.

222
00:13:08,822 --> 00:13:11,389
Yeah, you're really
going for it.

223
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:14,559
What does that mean?

224
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:17,362
You're going for it...
just, like, the job,
the house,

225
00:13:17,364 --> 00:13:20,231
the furniture...
the Lance.

226
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:22,200
( chuckles )

227
00:13:22,202 --> 00:13:24,068
I guess I grew up.

228
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:31,209
- So, what about you?
- <i> What about me?</i>

229
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:33,545
Well, last I heard,
you moved to LA
to be an actor?

230
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:35,847
That was, like,
10 years ago?

231
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:38,383
- Yeah, did you not hear?
I won an Oscar.
- Oh, very funny.

232
00:13:38,385 --> 00:13:41,986
Yeah, I played a retarded
Ukrainian immigrant

233
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:45,356
who inspires a bunch
of school kids in Brooklyn

234
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:47,458
by playing chess.

235
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:51,029
- Seriously.
- Seriously, acting's kinda hard
when you don't have an agent.

236
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:53,097
So...

237
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:54,332
Well, what are you
doing for money?

238
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,568
( chuckles )

239
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,937
Let me guess,
male prostitute joke
coming...

240
00:13:58,939 --> 00:14:00,405
What do you
want me to say, Maggie?

241
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:03,274
I wait tables
at a shitty tourist
restaurant in Hollywood.

242
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:05,676
It's fucking boring, the end.
What do you want to know?

243
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:11,516
<i>You know, I'm tired.
I'm gonna go to bed.</i>

244
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:14,319
All right,
good night.

245

<i>( door closes )</i>

Shit.

248
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:13,244
( Australian accent )
The key to buddy breathing
is not to panic.

249
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:17,015
Don't freak out
or you'll die.

250
00:15:17,017 --> 00:15:19,417
Don't yank the regulator
away from your partner.

251
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,286
Don't bogart
the thing either.

252
00:15:21,288 --> 00:15:24,589
All right, so,
everybody partner up.

253
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:26,925
Let's go,
let's do it.

254
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:32,430
Looking for a date?

255
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:35,533
- Huh?
- A partner.

256
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:39,203
Oh.
Oh, yeah, sure.

257
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:40,471
Okay.

258
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:10,568
Man:
<i>This is a book that we're</i>
<i>selling a lot more of.</i>

259
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,370
Uh, it's just
much more practical.

260
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:14,138
It's much more
hands-on.

261
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:17,141
- Does that sound...
- It sounds perfect.

262
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,177
Okay, good.
Yeah, good luck.

263
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:20,278
Thank you.

264
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:25,083

What are you doing here?

268
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:35,259
I just rolled into town.
I wanted to say...

269
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:36,761
No, what are you doing
here at the store?

270
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:40,031
I am looking for the new
Danielle Steel novel.

271
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,302
You should go.

272
00:16:44,304 --> 00:16:47,705
No... hey, no, I...
let's go hiking.

273
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:50,575
Let's go to
Kate's Lazy Meadow
and, you know,

274
00:16:50,577 --> 00:16:52,276
go to the
Harvest Festival and...

275
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:54,579
Milo, you're out
of your mind.

276
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:56,214
No, Rich,
I just think...

277
00:16:56,216 --> 00:16:57,496
Don't come here again.

278

<i>( music playing )</i>

00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:14,298
It's Dyke Night,
sweetie.

281
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:18,236
- It's what?
- Dyke Night.

Dyke Night?

283
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:24,175
I showed up
on Dyke Night?

284
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:26,144
Yeah.

285
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:28,112

Hey, Cal's Corner,
fucking Dyke Night.

- What?
- Oh, boy.

Dyke Night.

291

Milo, can we
talk about this
in the morning?

292
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,497
Sandra and Melissa
were very nice.

293
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:48,533
They were
two lesbian ladies

294
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:50,701
who taught me
how to play darts.

295

<i>But they were not
what I was looking for.</i>

296
00:17:52,806 --> 00:17:54,672
What I was looking for,
and you should know this

297
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:57,408
since we're
now related, Lance,

298
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,377
I was looking
for some cock.

299
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:01,446
Okay, Milo, enough.

300
00:18:01,448 --> 00:18:03,581
You're fine 'cause
you're married to my sister.

301
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,349
- You're off-limits.
- "Off-limits."

302
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:08,453
Just letting you know,
if any of your little
buddies around...

I'm a little tipsy.

- That's okay.

00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:20,131
- No shit.
- Phew.

00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:31,843
- Yeah, about last night.
- You can't do stuff like that.

311
00:18:31,845 --> 00:18:34,178
Sorry, I was just trying
to blow off some steam,
that's all.

312
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,313
I just...

313
00:18:35,315 --> 00:18:39,317
So, um, Lance
and I were talking,

314
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:42,453
and he might
need some help

315
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,555
on this trail project
at the dam.

316
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:47,291
Just clearing brush
and stuff.

317
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,694
A trail project
at the dam?

318
00:18:49,696 --> 00:18:53,297
Yeah.
It's what he does.

319
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:54,699
What do you mean,
clearing brush?

320
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:57,301
- Like picking up sticks?
- Brush... sticks and leaves

321
00:18:57,303 --> 00:19:00,404
and pieces of bushes
and stuff.

322
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:03,341
- <i> It might be good for you.</i>
- So, it's like a job?

323
00:19:03,343 --> 00:19:07,311
It might be nice
for you to spend time
with him and stuff.

324
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:10,648
Be out in nature
with the brush.

325
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:13,317
Do I get a sexy outfit?

326
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,553
I'll make sure of it.

327
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:22,793
Here.

328
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:26,731
- Ahem.
- I should've worn
longer sleeves.

329
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:30,468
Yeah, no, I mean,
next time, you know?

330
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,203
'Cause then if you
have long sleeves,

331
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:33,704
you can make more
of a scooping motion.

332
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:37,575
You might be able to get
more with each grab,
you know?

333
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:39,810
Yeah, no, I get it.

334
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:43,814
I'm not really
an outdoorsy kinda guy.

335
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:46,696
Right.
Well, no worries,
my man.

336
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,322
You know, I got
an extra fleece
in the truck.

337
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:52,924
- You want me to go...
- No, no, I'm good.

338
00:19:52,926 --> 00:19:54,559
- Thank you.

Nothing, I'm fine.

349
00:21:13,573 --> 00:21:14,672

Happy first day of work.

You didn't

What, you
don't like it?

No, I love it.
It's great.

00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:31,789
So, I told somebody
that I was in town,

00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,692
and I didn't think
she would come,

Uh, I guess whenever

Oh, my God.
You just have to show up.

Just drop in.
We don't like
to be scheduled.

- Perfect.
- Great, so how's next week?

Next... that's not gonna
actually be the best week.

394
00:23:01,781 --> 00:23:03,681
Okay, great.
The week after that.
We can go then.

how are the alpacas?

00:23:09,756 --> 00:23:13,858
We had to get rid of them.
Too much poop.

399
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,127
You know what they say,
everybody poops, right?

400
00:23:16,129 --> 00:23:18,629
When I was a kid,
I didn't think that
girls pooped.

401
00:23:18,631 --> 00:23:21,565
- Seriously.
- I've never taken
a shit before.

402

Milo.

403
00:23:24,437 --> 00:23:27,505
So what about
your insight retreats, Mom?

404
00:23:27,507 --> 00:23:29,573
What about them?

405
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:30,641
Do you have one
coming up?

406
00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:32,009
Why do you ask?

407
00:23:32,011 --> 00:23:33,911
Oh, I just want to make sure
I don't schedule

408
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:36,580
the most important event
of my life on the same day.

409
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:38,482
Okay, just...

410
00:23:38,484 --> 00:23:40,151
You know it broke my heart
to miss the wedding.

411
00:23:40,153 --> 00:23:42,520
Actually, you know,
I don't know that it did.

412
00:23:42,522 --> 00:23:46,590
- You're here now, right?
- Yes, yes. Thank you.

413
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:48,793
Did everybody hear
how I've never taken
a shit before?

414
00:23:48,795 --> 00:23:50,662
- Did you guys miss that?
- Lance: Yeah.

415
00:23:50,663 --> 00:23:52,530
Why are we talking about
such unpleasant things?

416
00:23:52,532 --> 00:23:55,699
Milo, what's new
with you, darling?

417
00:23:58,204 --> 00:24:00,738
I'm gonna go grab
the Tabasco.

418
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,073
Anybody like anything?

419
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:07,111

<i>- ( Milo exhales )
- Yes.</i>

426

You're cleansed.
Open your eyes.

427
00:24:23,596 --> 00:24:25,896
Oh, my God.
How do you feel?

428
00:24:25,898 --> 00:24:29,233
Good, yeah.
I might be a
little drunk.

429
00:24:29,235 --> 00:24:31,135
You look
completely different.

430
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:33,504
Oh, my God,
there's just...
there's a...

431
00:24:33,506 --> 00:24:36,707
a purity and a kind of
a glow coming off you.

432
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:39,477
It's emanating
from your crown chakra.

433
00:24:40,913 --> 00:24:42,746
Lance, would you like
to be cleansed?

434
00:24:42,748 --> 00:24:45,082
I'm okay, thank you.
I took a sauna this morning.

435
00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:47,651
- But I feel good.
- Sweetheart?

436
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:49,186
Oh, I don't usually
drink and cleanse.

437
00:24:49,188 --> 00:24:51,255
Just, like,
personal policy.

438
00:24:51,257 --> 00:24:52,923
<i>But thank you.</i>

439
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:56,060
Okay, I guess I should
be heading back.

440
00:24:56,062 --> 00:24:57,995
What, like,
back to Arizona?

441
00:24:57,997 --> 00:24:59,930
Well, it's a terrific
coincidence.

442
00:24:59,932 --> 00:25:04,068
You know, Maggie,
you asked me about
the insight retreat.

443
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,736
Guess where
it is this year?

444
00:25:05,738 --> 00:25:08,772
Woodstock.
Around the corner.

445
00:25:08,774 --> 00:25:10,808
Oh, you've
gotta be kidding.

446
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:13,077
I mean, it's such a...
this just worked out perfectly.

447
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:14,278
So that's why you came here?

448
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,280
No, no.

449
00:25:16,282 --> 00:25:17,715
I came here
to see you two.

450
00:25:17,717 --> 00:25:19,517
Oh, just shut up,
Mother.

451
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:22,686
- Hey, Maggie.
- This is classic.

452
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:25,289
- Classic bullshit.
- Okay, Maggie.

453
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:27,191
I have to compliment
you, though. I really do.

454
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:29,911
You gave it a good shot.

455
00:25:29,912 --> 00:25:32,630
But I have to tell you
you're really not that
good of an actress.

456
00:25:32,632 --> 00:25:34,999
Okay.
Well, as pleasant
as this is...

457
00:25:35,001 --> 00:25:37,301
Stop trying, Judy.

458
00:25:37,303 --> 00:25:40,671
Stop trying.

459
00:25:40,673 --> 00:25:43,841
There are worse things
than being a shitty mother.

460
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:49,079
So...

461
00:25:49,081 --> 00:25:51,181
if you've finished...

462
00:25:51,183 --> 00:25:53,684
vomiting all over me...
( chuckles )

463
00:25:53,686 --> 00:25:57,755
I will just say
thank you for dinner,

464
00:25:57,757 --> 00:26:01,025
and, Milo, thank you
for the invitation.

465
00:26:02,562 --> 00:26:05,829
I'm sorry the night
ended up being so toxic.

466
00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:09,099
I just want
you both to know.

467
00:26:09,101 --> 00:26:12,603
Oh, my God.

468
00:26:12,605 --> 00:26:15,139
I'm sending you the light.

469

<i>Good night, Lance.</i>

470
00:26:17,043 --> 00:26:19,563
Good night, Judy.
I'll walk you out.

Well, at least
she's sending us the light.

473
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:24,141
- Are those shoes?
- Uh, yeah, kinda.
They're a hybrid.

474
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:25,776
Hybrid of...

475
00:27:25,778 --> 00:27:29,713
Of, uh, you know,
just shoes and a foot.

476
00:27:29,715 --> 00:27:31,148
The human foot.

477
00:27:33,285 --> 00:27:36,220
You know, some people
use a knife and fork
for those things.

478
00:27:36,222 --> 00:27:38,756
Yeah? Well,
I'm not most people, babe,

479
00:27:38,758 --> 00:27:40,257
and I think that's
why you love me.

480

'Cause I set myself
aside from the pack.

- Hey.

484
00:27:49,368 --> 00:27:51,235
- What's up, chief?
- Mm-hmm.

485

No... nothing.

not like that?

490

You know I'm happy
that you're here, right?

491
00:28:06,285 --> 00:28:08,318
Ugh, here it comes.

- But...
- <i> What do you think?</i>

494
00:28:12,825 --> 00:28:15,359
- I thought she'd be different.
- It doesn't matter.

495
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:18,128
You had no right bringing
her into this house
without asking me.

Yes, Warden.

497

Did you really think
she'd be different,

498
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:24,702
that she actually
gave a shit about us?

499
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:27,371
- Maybe.
- Please.

500
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:29,206
She's been done with us
ever since Dad...

501
00:28:30,743 --> 00:28:33,444
I don't even blame him.

502
00:28:33,446 --> 00:28:36,046
Imagine being married to her.
I'd probably jump off
a bridge, too.

503
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:37,881
Okay.

504
00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:41,752
I don't want this.
Eat it.

505
00:28:43,122 --> 00:28:45,489
Okay.

506
00:28:45,491 --> 00:28:47,491
- So, how you feel?
- I'm good.

507

- Yeah?
- Yeah.

508

I'm a little embarrassed
about the other day.

509
00:28:52,832 --> 00:28:55,365
I was on planet Jupiter
or something.

Okay, 'cause I really
wasn't expecting to see
you anytime soon.

- I'm sure.
- This is weird.

got this agent.

- Yeah, I have
an agent now.

An agent.
Wow, that's impressive.

Yeah.

my sole purpose.

You know, I'm writing
this one-man show.

Well, it doesn't
surprise me at all.

- Pretty?
- It's stunning.

Sea turtles, manta rays,
blue sharks.

I guess.

00:34:39,511 --> 00:34:41,778
and then, kaboom,
you know?

621
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:44,147
A freakin' land mine
blows my nuts off.

622
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:45,182
Mm.

623
00:34:45,184 --> 00:34:47,201
- You know?
- Yeah.

624
00:34:47,202 --> 00:34:49,219
And I'll think,
"Oh, I coulda sworn my nuts
were there a minute ago.

625
00:34:49,221 --> 00:34:51,755
I wonder
where they went."

626
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:53,757
- No nuts.
- Oh, there...
there they are.

627
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:55,559
They got blown
clear across the room.

628
00:34:55,561 --> 00:34:57,227
They're sliding
down that wall over there.

629
00:34:57,229 --> 00:34:58,495
My nuts.

630
00:34:58,497 --> 00:35:00,564
And then, you know,
when I think about it,

631
00:35:00,566 --> 00:35:03,100
it was probably my fault
in the first place,

632
00:35:03,102 --> 00:35:05,970
so I'll just
apologize to her.

633
00:35:05,971 --> 00:35:08,839
<i>I probably said</i>
<i>something stupid</i>
<i>or insensitive,</i>

634
00:35:08,841 --> 00:35:11,641
so I'll just tell her
that I was sorry,

635
00:35:11,643 --> 00:35:13,243
and then it's fine.

636
00:35:13,245 --> 00:35:16,346
Mm.

637
00:35:16,348 --> 00:35:18,515

All right, look,
I'm sorry.

642
00:35:33,365 --> 00:35:35,332
I'm an idiot.

643
00:35:35,334 --> 00:35:36,633
So what else is new?

644
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:39,503
You'd make
an amazing mother, okay?

645
00:35:39,505 --> 00:35:42,572
I thought
I was too uptight?

646
00:35:42,574 --> 00:35:46,209
I just said that
so I didn't have to talk
about the real issue,

647
00:35:46,211 --> 00:35:48,131
which is
your morbid obesity.

648
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:51,721
I'm surprised you
can even leave the house.

When was the last time
you had your teeth cleaned?

something, Maggie.
- What?

Last month
in LA, um...

713
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:00,603
What? What?

714
00:39:00,605 --> 00:39:03,006
I ate pussy.

715
00:39:03,008 --> 00:39:04,674
What?

716
00:39:06,745 --> 00:39:08,545
- What?
- I know, I'm not
proud of it.

717
00:39:08,547 --> 00:39:11,081
Why? How?
Why? Who?

718
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:14,017
I... she looked like
a young Debbie Harry.

719
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:17,954
I was drunk and curious.
I just couldn't resist.

720
00:39:17,956 --> 00:39:21,024
Oh, my gosh.

721
00:39:21,026 --> 00:39:23,660
Well, what...
how... verdict?

722
00:39:23,662 --> 00:39:25,729
Uh, I was a little
out to sea.

723
00:39:25,731 --> 00:39:28,431
I'll tell you that.

724
00:39:28,433 --> 00:39:32,669
Out in a wet,
stormy,

725
00:39:32,671 --> 00:39:35,605
- pungent sea.
- Ew.

726
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,410
( groans )

727
00:39:40,412 --> 00:39:41,444
All right,
now your turn.

728
00:39:41,446 --> 00:39:43,146
My turn?

729
00:39:43,148 --> 00:39:46,508
I told you a secret.
You have to tell me
a secret.

730
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,153
I don't have
any secrets.

731
00:39:50,155 --> 00:39:52,088
Maggie.

732
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:54,524
Maggie Dean.

733
00:39:58,497 --> 00:40:01,064
I'm on birth control.

734
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:04,100
Really?

735
00:40:04,102 --> 00:40:06,436
- Yeah.
- Oh.

736
00:40:06,438 --> 00:40:09,639
I hide it in the basket
in the bathroom.

737
00:40:09,641 --> 00:40:11,674
I figure Lance
won't be looking

738
00:40:11,676 --> 00:40:14,511
for butterfly decorative
soaps anytime soon.

739
00:40:15,981 --> 00:40:18,148
So... ( sighs )

740
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:21,050
it's terrible.

741
00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:23,720
Wouldn't it be easier
just to tell Lance

742
00:40:23,722 --> 00:40:25,455
you're not ready
to have a kid?

743
00:40:25,457 --> 00:40:27,590
Yeah.

744
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:29,192
( laughs )
It would be
a lot easier.

745
00:40:30,729 --> 00:40:35,432
But there's a little more
to it than that.

746
00:40:35,434 --> 00:40:37,133
What?

747
00:40:40,705 --> 00:40:42,265
- It's really bad.
- What?

748
00:40:43,675 --> 00:40:45,642
I slept with
my scuba instructor.

749
00:40:45,644 --> 00:40:47,644
Maggie.

750
00:40:47,646 --> 00:40:49,112
I know, it sounds
like a porno.

751
00:40:49,114 --> 00:40:53,049
<i>Just once?</i>

752
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:55,585
- With him?
- "With<i> him"?</i>

753
00:40:55,587 --> 00:40:58,087
Yeah. I took
a French cooking class
like six months ago.

754
00:40:58,089 --> 00:40:59,789
<i>Maggie!</i>

755
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:04,727
And a nature photography
course... I met this guy.

756
00:41:04,729 --> 00:41:07,063
It's a fetish
is what it sounds like.

757
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:12,469
If Lance finds out,
it will destroy him

758
00:41:12,471 --> 00:41:15,472
and I will not be able
to live with myself.

759
00:41:19,744 --> 00:41:22,579
Please say something.

760
00:41:22,581 --> 00:41:25,515
I guess Lance just
doesn't do it for you.

761
00:41:25,517 --> 00:41:27,684
But why?
He's so great.

762
00:41:27,686 --> 00:41:32,522
He's so sweet
and cute and nice

763
00:41:32,524 --> 00:41:34,858
and he would make
such a great dad,

764
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:38,928
and he is the polar opposite
of all the assholes
that I'm used to dating.

765
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:45,268
He doesn't deserve
a fucking whore as a wife.

766
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:47,003
- You're not a whore,
so don't say that, please.
- Oh, really?

767
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:48,671
What would
you call it, then?

768
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:52,675
You're a restless housewife
with whore-like tendencies.

769
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:54,978
Shut up.

770
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,180
It doesn't help.

771
00:41:57,249 --> 00:41:59,249
Do you love him?

772
00:41:59,251 --> 00:42:02,752
Yeah, I do.

773
00:42:02,754 --> 00:42:06,723
He's... he's good.

774
00:42:06,725 --> 00:42:08,992
Maybe good
isn't your thing.

775
00:42:08,994 --> 00:42:11,227
Maybe.

What am I gonna do?

777
00:42:16,101 --> 00:42:19,068
You're gonna do
a bunch of nitrous
with your gay brother?

778
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:21,638
( laughs )

779
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,540
You wanna talk about
this more downstairs?

780
00:42:23,542 --> 00:42:25,275
Sure.

781
00:42:28,213 --> 00:42:31,080
- Oh, this hurts my back.
- Me, too, my spine.

782
00:42:31,082 --> 00:42:32,248
Why did I say,
"Let's talk downstairs"?

783
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,250
I don't know.
( sighs )

784
00:42:37,088 --> 00:42:38,254
Wait, what time is it?

785
00:42:38,256 --> 00:42:39,656
I don't know.

786
00:42:39,658 --> 00:42:42,091
Shit.

787
00:42:42,093 --> 00:42:43,259
What?

788
00:42:43,261 --> 00:42:45,028
Come on, we gotta go.

789
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:47,063
- Why?
- I have a meeting.

790
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:48,798
You have a meeting?
With who?

791
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,702
With, um, Kevin Clancy
from high school.

792
00:42:52,704 --> 00:42:55,138
- Really?
- Yeah.

793
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:56,739
Cool.
Can I come?

794
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:59,309
Uh, no.

795
00:42:59,311 --> 00:43:03,746
I think he wanted to make it
kind of like a one-on-one
kind of meeting.

796
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:05,748
- Oh.
- Is that weird?
I'm sorry.

797
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,250
- No, no, it's fine.
- Is that cool?

798
00:43:07,252 --> 00:43:08,217
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- All right, we gotta go,
though.

799
00:43:08,219 --> 00:43:09,719
We gotta go.

No, listen, it's like,
"Melvin, dude, please,

about a whale,

a guy who catches a whale.

Why does it have
to be 800 pages

806
00:43:19,598 --> 00:43:22,098
of the history
of whaling

807
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,801
and all this existential
crisis bullshit?"

808
00:43:24,803 --> 00:43:28,171
Like, who gives a shit
when the writing is that weird

809
00:43:28,173 --> 00:43:30,607
and funny and rich
and alive

810
00:43:30,609 --> 00:43:32,642

And pretentious...
and pretentious.

813
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,681
There's a great
"Moby-Dick" illustrated

- ( imitates snoring )
- that I think you'd love.

815
00:43:40,151 --> 00:43:42,151
There's a pop-up whale
at the end.

816
00:43:42,153 --> 00:43:43,353
Fuck you.

817
00:43:45,724 --> 00:43:47,690
Didn't I give you a whale?

818
00:43:47,692 --> 00:43:52,095
I feel like I gave you,
like, a copper figurine

819
00:43:52,097 --> 00:43:55,365
for your birthday
that I got at that...

820

Wow.
You carry that with you?

821
00:43:58,903 --> 00:44:03,072
I don't know.
It's, like, a little
good luck charm or something.

822
00:44:03,074 --> 00:44:06,743
Well, it's working.

Is it?
I don't know if it is.

Yeah.
Yeah, Mr. Fancy LA Agent.

I wish I kept
that whale for myself.

826

It's not that big of a deal.
He's not that big of an agent.

I'm proud of you, Milo.

What?

834

Well, actually, they're
called lobster pots,

835
00:44:47,419 --> 00:44:49,285
but they can
knock these guys
right off the deck.

836
00:44:49,287 --> 00:44:51,721
They're real dangerous.

Oh.

working out?

Good. He's definitely
doing his best,

you could pass it along

938
00:50:15,113 --> 00:50:16,579
Wow.

939
00:50:16,581 --> 00:50:18,047
( exhales sharply )

940
00:50:25,656 --> 00:50:27,156
What are you doing?

941
00:50:30,128 --> 00:50:31,293
Milo.

<i>¶... gonna
stop us now... ¶</i>

987

Hi.

988
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:57,600
Uh, is your dad home?

989
00:53:57,602 --> 00:53:59,702
Yeah, hold on.

990
00:53:59,704 --> 00:54:02,638
Dad, some guy's
at the door for you.

991
00:54:06,344 --> 00:54:07,543
I'm sorry,
I thought you had him...

992
00:54:07,545 --> 00:54:08,978
What are you doing?
You can't be here.

993
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:10,546
That's my kid in there.

994
00:54:10,548 --> 00:54:11,680
Okay, I thought
you only had him
on the weekends.

995
00:54:11,682 --> 00:54:14,350
I have a life, Milo.
A whole life.

996
00:54:26,464 --> 00:54:28,330
Give me a shot
of Cuervo, please.

997
00:54:28,332 --> 00:54:30,666
<i>( liquid pours )</i>

999
00:54:35,006 --> 00:54:37,406
Can I have
another one, please?

Man:<i> Hey.</i>

1004
00:55:53,117 --> 00:55:54,883
What are you
doing up here?

1005
00:55:54,885 --> 00:55:59,355
I'm waiting for you,
Mr. Big Officer Man.

1006
00:55:59,357 --> 00:56:01,590
The fuck you say?

1007
00:56:01,592 --> 00:56:03,592
Maggie:<i> Thank you.</i>
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

1008
00:56:03,594 --> 00:56:05,027
No problem.
Take care, now.

1009
00:56:05,029 --> 00:56:06,695
Thanks.

1010
00:56:11,569 --> 00:56:12,668
Maggie, don't freak out.

1011
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:14,603
What is going on?

1012
00:56:14,605 --> 00:56:15,704
You wouldn't understand.

1013
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:19,575
Try me.
You might be surprised.

1014
00:56:19,577 --> 00:56:22,044
I get depressed
about my life

1015
00:56:22,046 --> 00:56:23,912
and I do stupid things.
That's it.

1016
00:56:23,914 --> 00:56:26,448
We all get sad
about our lives, Milo.

1017
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:28,016
That doesn't mean we go
jumping off of rooftops.

1018
00:56:28,018 --> 00:56:29,151
I wasn't gonna jump.

1019
00:56:29,153 --> 00:56:30,452
Okay, well,
how do I know that?

1020
00:56:30,454 --> 00:56:32,921
Okay, I'm sorry.

1021
00:56:35,593 --> 00:56:38,594
I can't take this, Milo.

1022
00:56:38,596 --> 00:56:40,496
I can't right now.
I can't.

1023
00:56:40,498 --> 00:56:42,064
Hey, I'm sorry.

1024
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:49,838
Do you remember
Justin Meyer in eighth grade?

1025
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:52,908
Jock, asshole, he used to
fuck with me all the time?

1026
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:57,713
Dad, he told me...
he said, "Guys like Justin...

1027
00:56:57,715 --> 00:57:01,817
like, high school is the best
it's ever gonna get for them.

1028
00:57:01,819 --> 00:57:03,819
They're gonna peak
in high school,

1029
00:57:03,821 --> 00:57:06,688
and the rest of their life
is just gonna be...

1030
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:08,657
a disappointment."

1031
00:57:08,659 --> 00:57:11,193
And that kids like me...

1032
00:57:11,195 --> 00:57:14,997
that I would soar
after high school.

1033
00:57:17,034 --> 00:57:18,767
<i>And, in fact,
I would sit there,</i>

1034
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:20,836
I would fast-forward
10 years into the future

1035
00:57:20,838 --> 00:57:24,640
and I would think about
our high school reunion

1036
00:57:24,642 --> 00:57:27,209
and seeing Justin,
and he would just be

1037
00:57:27,211 --> 00:57:31,180
this fat, balding guy

1038
00:57:31,182 --> 00:57:34,716
who, you know,
is the assistant manager
at some sporting goods store,

1039
00:57:34,718 --> 00:57:38,720
and... and I would be

1040
00:57:38,722 --> 00:57:40,589
this famous actor

1041
00:57:40,591 --> 00:57:43,125
who lives in LA or New York

1042
00:57:43,127 --> 00:57:45,694
and I have this
beautiful boyfriend.

1043
00:57:45,696 --> 00:57:48,030
And I'm happy.

1044
00:57:51,569 --> 00:57:55,737
Do you know I looked
Justin up online?

1045
00:57:55,739 --> 00:57:59,107
And do you know
what he's doing now?

1046
00:57:59,109 --> 00:58:02,778
He's an electrician,

1047
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:06,582
and he has
two beautiful daughters

1048
00:58:06,584 --> 00:58:09,184
and a pretty wife.

1049
00:58:09,186 --> 00:58:11,520
And he's happy.

1050
00:58:14,692 --> 00:58:16,992
And it turns out that...

1051
00:58:20,898 --> 00:58:23,565
it just turns out that
I'm the one that peaked
in high school.

1052
00:58:29,807 --> 00:58:34,042
You know, if that's not
depressing, then...

1053
00:58:34,044 --> 00:58:36,645
So, that's it, sweetie?

1054
00:58:36,647 --> 00:58:39,882
You're not
a famous actor?

1055
00:58:39,884 --> 00:58:43,085
'Cause I got news for you.
No one's a famous actor.

1056
00:58:43,087 --> 00:58:44,820
George Clooney's
a famous actor.

1057
00:58:44,822 --> 00:58:47,122
Okay, George Clooney,
I guess that's one exception.

1058
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:52,728
<i>But the rest of us
are just walking around</i>

1059
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:56,064
trying not
to be disappointed

1060
00:58:56,066 --> 00:58:59,226
with the way
that our lives
turned out.

1061
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:04,973
And either we find
a way to deal or...

1062
00:59:09,013 --> 00:59:11,747
I need to know

1063
00:59:11,749 --> 00:59:14,249
you're not gonna
check out on me.

1064
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:17,953
I'll do my best.

1065
00:59:34,572 --> 00:59:37,239
What?

1066
00:59:39,076 --> 00:59:41,276
Ugh.

1067
00:59:41,278 --> 00:59:42,711
Ugh.

1068
00:59:45,649 --> 00:59:47,749
What are you doing?

1069
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:50,185
It's gotta be
in here somewhere.

1070
00:59:52,323 --> 00:59:55,357
Oh, my God.

1071
00:59:57,995 --> 00:59:59,995
Wow.

1072
00:59:59,997 --> 01:00:02,264
Oh, here it is!
I found it!

1073
01:00:02,266 --> 01:00:04,166
Oh, my God.
You still have that thing?

1074
01:00:05,736 --> 01:00:08,036
- We're going out.
- What?

1075
01:00:08,038 --> 01:00:10,072
It is Halloween,
Lance is at fantasy football,

1076
01:00:10,074 --> 01:00:13,141
I say you put on something
pretty and/or freaky.

1077
01:00:13,143 --> 01:00:14,776
Preferably both.

1078
01:00:14,778 --> 01:00:16,778
Yeah.

1079
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:18,680
( muffled )
I can do this
better myself.

1080
01:00:18,682 --> 01:00:20,082
- No, I wanna do it.
- Mm-hmm.

1081
01:00:20,084 --> 01:00:22,217
<i>¶ Secret... ¶</i>

1082
01:00:22,219 --> 01:00:24,353
Okay.

1083
01:00:39,703 --> 01:00:41,003
Tell me if you
don't like it.

1084
01:00:41,005 --> 01:00:43,071
I will tell you immediately
if I don't like it.

1085
01:00:43,073 --> 01:00:44,272
Ah!

1086

( laughs )

1087
01:00:46,377 --> 01:00:47,743
Is that
a good scream?

1088
01:00:47,745 --> 01:00:49,211
That was a great scream.
I love it.

1089
01:00:49,213 --> 01:00:51,346
Oh, my God.
I can't believe
it still fits.

1090
01:00:51,348 --> 01:00:53,215
- I know.
- Look at me.

1091
01:00:53,217 --> 01:00:55,083
You have better legs
than I do, by the way.

1092
01:00:55,085 --> 01:00:56,685
Oh, I have a body
like a frog.

1093
01:00:56,687 --> 01:00:58,020
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

1094
01:00:58,022 --> 01:00:59,221
What does that mean?

1095
01:00:59,223 --> 01:01:00,756
Just a big belly
and long arms and long legs.

1096
01:01:00,758 --> 01:01:02,658
Just like...
( groans )

1097
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:06,862
<i>¶ I've got a secret
and I can't explain ¶</i>

1098
01:01:06,864 --> 01:01:10,966
<i>¶ All the time
I've waited for this day ¶</i>

1099
01:01:10,968 --> 01:01:13,835
<i>¶ All along,
I was never in doubt... ¶</i>

1100
01:01:13,837 --> 01:01:15,704
- Maggie:<i> Oh, Michelle Waller.</i>
- Milo:<i> Uh-huh?</i>

1101
01:01:15,706 --> 01:01:17,172
Pregnant again,
baby number three.

1102
01:01:17,174 --> 01:01:19,241
- Baby number three?
- Yeah.

1103
01:01:19,243 --> 01:01:22,411
- Shit, I didn't even
know she was married.
- Yeah.

1104
01:01:22,413 --> 01:01:25,681
Milo:
<i>We haven't done the</i>
<i>cemetery walk since Dad died.</i>

1105
01:01:25,683 --> 01:01:27,182
Maggie:<i> I know.</i>

1106
01:01:27,184 --> 01:01:28,884
Oh, my God,
watch your step.

1107
01:01:28,886 --> 01:01:31,319
- <i> ( dog howls )</i>
- God, it has not changed a bit.

1108
01:01:31,321 --> 01:01:33,422
I had my first
wine cooler here.

1109
01:01:33,424 --> 01:01:35,457
- With who?
- Jenny Cokeland.

1110
01:01:35,459 --> 01:01:38,026
( laughs )
That makes sense.

1111
01:01:38,028 --> 01:01:40,162
Yeah.

1112
01:01:42,166 --> 01:01:44,066
Oh, wow.

1113
01:01:44,068 --> 01:01:48,403
<i>( man cackles
on recording )</i>

1114
01:01:48,405 --> 01:01:50,338
Dad loved Halloween.

1115
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:52,107
Who can blame him?

1116
01:01:52,109 --> 01:01:56,378
( roaring )

1117
01:01:59,116 --> 01:02:01,149
- Scram.
- ( halfhearted ) Rawr.

1118
01:02:01,151 --> 01:02:04,052
- Get outta here.
- Rawr.

1119
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:05,253
What, are you deaf?

1120
01:02:05,255 --> 01:02:08,256
I'm not deaf.
It's Halloween, assholes.

1121
01:02:10,728 --> 01:02:12,448
- Fucking people.
- ( laughs )

1122
01:02:18,168 --> 01:02:19,501
Oh, my God.

1123
01:02:19,503 --> 01:02:23,238
Wait, what was the name
of the... the...

1124
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:26,174
adolescent psychiatrist
that they assigned us?

1125
01:02:26,176 --> 01:02:28,110
- What was her name?
- Oh, um, shit.

1126
01:02:28,112 --> 01:02:30,912
- <i> Mary?</i>
- Uh, Mamie Mortimer.

1127
01:02:30,914 --> 01:02:33,315
- Mamie Mortimer.
- Mamie Mortimer
and her fucking journals.

1128
01:02:33,317 --> 01:02:35,517
Giant sweaters.

1129
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:37,753
What was
with those sweaters?

1130
01:02:37,755 --> 01:02:39,988
Huge!
She's not a big woman.

1131
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:42,824
Every day was Christmas
for Mamie Mortimer.

1132
01:02:42,826 --> 01:02:45,527
Oh, my God.
"Did you write that
in your journal?"

1133
01:02:45,529 --> 01:02:47,829
"There's nothing that can't
be solved by journaling."

1134
01:02:47,831 --> 01:02:50,031
"Oh, your dad died?
Put it in a journal.

1135
01:02:50,033 --> 01:02:52,434
You forgot about it,
didn't ya?"

1136
01:02:52,436 --> 01:02:54,069
She had
a tough gig, though.

1137
01:02:54,071 --> 01:02:55,537
I mean, we were not...
we were not good kids.

1138
01:02:55,539 --> 01:02:58,373
I mean, what do you do
to two kids whose dad...

1139
01:02:58,375 --> 01:02:59,808
You make them
keep a journal.

1140
01:02:59,810 --> 01:03:02,027
Yeah, I mean,
we were 14.

1141
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:04,245
God, we were ungrateful
bastards, though. Right?

1142
01:03:04,248 --> 01:03:06,381
Speak for yourself.

1143
01:03:06,383 --> 01:03:08,250
I was an angel.
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1144
01:03:08,252 --> 01:03:09,785
Maggie.

1145
01:03:09,787 --> 01:03:11,920
- "Maggie."
- <i> Maggie.</i>

1146
01:03:11,922 --> 01:03:14,222
Let me... oh, wait.
Let me see it.

1147
01:03:14,224 --> 01:03:15,791
What?

1148
01:03:17,528 --> 01:03:19,361
I want to see it.

1149
01:03:19,363 --> 01:03:20,495
<i>Oh, what is that,
a new place?</i>

1150
01:03:20,497 --> 01:03:22,097
No, it's always
been here.

1151
01:03:22,099 --> 01:03:26,201
Oh, there she is,
dancing away.

1152
01:03:26,203 --> 01:03:28,436
Of course she is.

1153
01:03:28,438 --> 01:03:30,472
Did you think
I got rid of it?

1154
01:03:30,474 --> 01:03:33,914
I don't know.
You're a tricky
bird, Magpie.

1155
01:03:36,246 --> 01:03:43,552
<i>¶ 'Cause I've never seen
anything like this before... ¶</i>

1156
01:03:43,554 --> 01:03:46,588
How'd we go 10 years
without talking?

1157
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:49,357
Oh, it's probably not
worth talking about now.

1158
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:52,527
Probably not.

1159
01:03:52,529 --> 01:03:56,264
<i>¶ And he says
he cannot help me ¶</i>

1160
01:03:56,266 --> 01:04:01,469
<i>¶ 'Cause he doesn't
have a clue ¶</i>

1161
01:04:01,471 --> 01:04:07,475
<i>¶ I think that you must be
from outer space... ¶</i>

1162
01:04:07,477 --> 01:04:09,477
Let me take my hat off.

1163
01:04:09,479 --> 01:04:11,513
- Come on.
- Be polite.

1164
01:04:11,515 --> 01:04:17,519
<i>¶ ...on the stars ¶</i>

1165
01:04:17,521 --> 01:04:24,025
<i>¶ I think you must be
extraterrestrial ¶</i>

1166
01:04:24,027 --> 01:04:28,263
<i>¶ 'Cause you can open up
the heavens for me ¶</i>

1167
01:04:28,265 --> 01:04:32,500
<i>¶ With just one smile ¶</i>

1168
01:04:32,502 --> 01:04:36,438
<i>¶ Just one smile ¶</i>

1169
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:42,444
<i>¶ Just one smile ¶</i>

1170
01:05:01,164 --> 01:05:07,903
<i>¶ What is that sound</i>
<i>coming out of your mouth?</i> ¶

1171
01:05:07,905 --> 01:05:14,609
<i>¶ 'Cause I've never heard
anything like that before... ¶</i>

1172
01:05:30,227 --> 01:05:33,228
Magpie.

1173
01:05:33,230 --> 01:05:35,397
Oh, peeing in a dress
at a urinal

1174
01:05:35,399 --> 01:05:36,631
is actually
not that hard.

1175
01:05:36,633 --> 01:05:38,633
I'm gonna go.

1176
01:05:38,635 --> 01:05:40,602
Do you want
another round?

1177
01:05:40,604 --> 01:05:42,404
I'm gonna go.

1178
01:05:42,406 --> 01:05:45,240
Hey, hey.
( whistles )

1179
01:05:45,242 --> 01:05:47,142
Wait up, Maggie.

1180
01:05:47,144 --> 01:05:49,311
Hey, what's going on?

1181
01:05:49,313 --> 01:05:51,713
Kevin Clancy?

1182
01:05:51,715 --> 01:05:55,150
Kevin Clancy moved
to Miami six years ago.

1183
01:05:55,152 --> 01:05:57,385
He was in town
for the weekend.

1184
01:05:59,623 --> 01:06:02,424
What?
What is this?

1185
01:06:02,426 --> 01:06:04,359
I saw your cell phone.

1186
01:06:04,361 --> 01:06:06,561
Uh, you have a missed call
from Rich Levitt.

1187
01:06:09,199 --> 01:06:11,566
Are you sleeping
with him?

1188
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:17,205
Some of us have our secrets
and some of us have
our reasons, Maggie.

1189
01:06:17,207 --> 01:06:19,107
Wow.

1190
01:06:19,109 --> 01:06:21,576
So, what, you're still
attracted to child molesters?

1191
01:06:21,578 --> 01:06:23,578
Is that it?

1192
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:25,213
He's not
a child molester.

1193
01:06:25,215 --> 01:06:27,615
You were 15 and he
was your English teacher.

1194
01:06:27,617 --> 01:06:29,317
You didn't see
the way he treated me.

1195
01:06:29,319 --> 01:06:32,354
- He wanted to fuck you.
- Who are you to judge, okay?

1196
01:06:32,356 --> 01:06:34,589
You've had boyfriends
since you were in the
fifth grade, okay?

1197
01:06:34,591 --> 01:06:37,425
I was 15. I had never
been kissed before.

1198
01:06:37,427 --> 01:06:39,761
- So what if he was
my teacher?
- So what?

1199
01:06:39,763 --> 01:06:42,163
He made me feel good!
He made me feel good
about myself!

1200
01:06:42,165 --> 01:06:44,749
I don't want to hear
how he made you feel.

1201
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:47,334
You know what?
You wanna go hang out
with Rich Levitt, go ahead.

1202
01:06:47,337 --> 01:06:48,570
I am not gonna
stop you.

1203
01:06:48,572 --> 01:06:50,171
But when all that
shit went down,

1204
01:06:50,173 --> 01:06:52,540
I know, looking back,
I was right.

1205
01:06:52,542 --> 01:06:55,143
And I can't feel guilty
about it anymore.

1206
01:06:55,145 --> 01:06:57,278
And it could've
been a lot worse.

1207
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:58,546
He could've gone
to fucking jail, Milo.

1208
01:06:58,548 --> 01:07:00,215
Do you realize that?

1209
01:07:00,217 --> 01:07:02,217
He is lucky that we
dealt with this quietly.

1210
01:07:02,219 --> 01:07:04,352
And I know you blame me,
and I know you think

1211
01:07:04,354 --> 01:07:07,322
I ruined this
blossoming relationship
between you and him.

1212
01:07:07,324 --> 01:07:09,557
I know you think
I ruined his life,
that I ruined your life,

1213
01:07:09,559 --> 01:07:11,493
<i>but I did
what I had to do.</i>

1214
01:07:11,495 --> 01:07:13,395
Look, it had nothing
to do with you.

1215
01:07:13,397 --> 01:07:16,364
That is bullshit.

1216
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:18,633
You're my brother.

1217
01:07:21,571 --> 01:07:24,272
And we're supposed to
be there for each other.

1218
01:07:24,274 --> 01:07:27,575
<i>And if you don't
get that by now,</i>

1219
01:07:27,577 --> 01:07:31,312
then, I don't know,
I guess I'll talk to you
in another 10 years.

1220
01:07:31,314 --> 01:07:34,149
- Maggie, wait.
- This sucks.

1221
01:07:34,151 --> 01:07:36,584
I was having such
a good night with you.

1222
01:07:51,268 --> 01:07:54,302
( retches )

1223
01:07:54,304 --> 01:07:57,205
( panting )

1224
01:08:06,349 --> 01:08:08,283
Sunday,
Monday, Tuesday...

1225
01:08:10,487 --> 01:08:12,754
Sunday, Monday...

1226
01:08:14,458 --> 01:08:17,092
oh, shit.

1227
01:08:42,619 --> 01:08:45,487
- Morning, chief.
- Morning.

1228
01:08:45,489 --> 01:08:48,256
Well, looks like your sis
is down for the count.

1229
01:08:48,258 --> 01:08:51,593
I think she's got, like,
food poisoning or something.

1230
01:08:51,595 --> 01:08:53,728
Right, or something.

1231
01:08:53,730 --> 01:08:55,563
Maybe we should have
a dude's day.

1232
01:08:55,565 --> 01:08:59,701
- A what?
- You know, dude's day.

1233
01:08:59,703 --> 01:09:02,403
I think your version
of dude's day

1234
01:09:02,405 --> 01:09:05,740
and my version of dude's day
are totally different.

1235
01:09:05,742 --> 01:09:08,843
<i>¶ I said,
"Hey, the time has come ¶</i>

1236
01:09:08,845 --> 01:09:11,212
<i>¶ To throw the work away
and have some fun"... ¶</i>

1237
01:09:11,214 --> 01:09:12,614
Oh, shit.

1238
01:09:12,616 --> 01:09:15,416
( whimpers )
Oh, shit!

1239
01:09:15,418 --> 01:09:17,752
Come on, man.
You almost had it that time.

1240
01:09:17,754 --> 01:09:20,655
Lance, this harness has my balls
in my fucking throat.

1241
01:09:20,657 --> 01:09:22,490
Can I please come down?

1242
01:09:22,492 --> 01:09:24,626
It's all part
of the experience,
buddy boy.

1243
01:09:24,628 --> 01:09:26,728
The only good thing
about this experience

1244
01:09:26,730 --> 01:09:28,696
is that every guy in here's
gorgeous.

1245
01:09:28,698 --> 01:09:30,598
Yeah, it's great here, man.

1246
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:32,767
You're surrounded by
a bunch of hunks.
It's beautiful.

1247
01:09:32,769 --> 01:09:34,469
<i>Come on,
you gotta use the pain.</i>

1248
01:09:34,471 --> 01:09:35,904
<i>Get inspired by it.</i>

1249
01:09:35,906 --> 01:09:38,606
What are you, some sort of,
like, climbing Nazi?

1250
01:09:38,608 --> 01:09:40,208
I just believe in you,
that's all.

1251
01:09:40,210 --> 01:09:41,876
Come on, I saw you out there
working at the park.

1252
01:09:41,878 --> 01:09:43,778
You got it in you, dude.
I believe in you.

1253
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:46,580
( whispers )
You're such a piece
of shit, Lance.

1254
01:09:48,218 --> 01:09:50,318
Yeah, awesome.
Awesome.

1255
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:53,188
<i>Just keep doing it
just like that, man.</i>

1256
01:09:53,190 --> 01:09:54,889
( grunts, moans )

1257
01:09:54,891 --> 01:09:57,492
That's what I'm talking about!
Boo-ya, dude!

1258
01:09:57,494 --> 01:09:59,527
- To dude's day.
- To dude's day.

1259
01:09:59,529 --> 01:10:00,929
I gotta tell you,
you were channeling

1260
01:10:00,931 --> 01:10:04,332
my middle school
PE teacher out there.

1261
01:10:04,334 --> 01:10:06,467
Yeah, you were
into it, huh?

1262
01:10:06,469 --> 01:10:09,737
- Mm-hmm. Yeah, it was very...
you're very motivating.
- Thank you.

1263
01:10:09,739 --> 01:10:11,406
You're gonna be
a good dad someday.
That was good.

1264
01:10:11,408 --> 01:10:12,740
<i>Thanks, man.</i>

1265
01:10:12,742 --> 01:10:14,442
It's funny
'cause all my buddies,

1266
01:10:14,444 --> 01:10:16,778
they're scared shitless about
the whole fatherhood thing,

1267
01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:19,614
and, yeah, I just know
that I'm ready for it.

1268
01:10:19,616 --> 01:10:22,317
<i>That's why
the whole pregnancy thing</i>

1269
01:10:22,319 --> 01:10:24,285
has been frustrating,
you know?

1270
01:10:24,287 --> 01:10:27,655
Just wanna make sure
I'm not firing blanks,
you know?

1271
01:10:27,657 --> 01:10:29,257
Right.

1272
01:10:29,259 --> 01:10:31,179
<i>Guess I'm just
a little paranoid.</i>

1273
01:10:32,862 --> 01:10:37,332
Have... have you noticed
her acting a little strange
at all lately?

1274
01:10:37,334 --> 01:10:40,668
Like, uh...
I mean, uh...

1275
01:10:40,670 --> 01:10:43,571
uh, I don't know
what I mean.

1276
01:10:43,573 --> 01:10:45,473
I know
what you mean, yeah.

1277
01:10:45,475 --> 01:10:47,809
It'll all happen in Hawaii.
That's how I feel.

1278
01:10:47,811 --> 01:10:50,778
Just in between
the trade winds
and the palm trees

1279
01:10:50,780 --> 01:10:55,950
and the people and,
you know, exotic spices.

1280
01:10:55,952 --> 01:10:57,452
Yeah.

1281
01:10:57,454 --> 01:10:58,620
Maybe we'll
do it in a hammock.

1282
01:10:58,622 --> 01:11:00,521
Meh.

1283
01:11:00,523 --> 01:11:02,523
Hawaii's definitely
baby-making country.

1284
01:11:02,525 --> 01:11:04,292
Heh.

1285
01:11:04,294 --> 01:11:08,329
You know, Maggie
can be very...

1286
01:11:08,331 --> 01:11:09,864
s-secretive.

1287
01:11:09,866 --> 01:11:12,267
<i>Like, when we were
kids and stuff,</i>

1288
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:14,669
<i>she would hide cigarettes</i>
<i>and things like that</i>
<i>around the house.</i>

1289
01:11:14,671 --> 01:11:19,507
You know, places you
wouldn't think to look.

1290
01:11:19,509 --> 01:11:23,945
Maybe there's
some medication or something
that's affecting things.

1291
01:11:23,947 --> 01:11:26,381
Just a thought.

1292
01:11:26,383 --> 01:11:29,350
Yeah, I don't think
Maggie'd hide something
like that from me.

1293
01:11:29,352 --> 01:11:30,652
I'm sure
you're right.

1294
01:11:30,654 --> 01:11:31,853
Yeah?

1295
01:11:42,732 --> 01:11:45,366
Hey, miss, do you
need help with anything?

1296
01:11:45,368 --> 01:11:48,069
Yeah, you know what?

1297
01:11:48,071 --> 01:11:51,339
I'm... I... I...
I just, um...

1298
01:11:51,341 --> 01:11:53,408
I'm a little late.

1299
01:11:53,410 --> 01:11:54,876
But not seriously late,
just a little.

1300
01:11:54,878 --> 01:11:57,312
But I'm... you know what?
I don't need this.

1301
01:11:57,314 --> 01:12:00,448
I'm fine, thanks.

1302
01:12:03,753 --> 01:12:05,486
Thank you
for putting that back.

1303

Thanks.

- Hey!
- You had no right!

crash down eventually.

No, you were just
trying to get back at me.

I was trying

- What marriage?
- Fuck you.

1379

to do anything about it,

- then I will.
- Oh, so, you know
what's best for me?

each other out.

- How?
- We are adults.
This is my marriage.

a marriage, then you're
fucking nuts, okay?

I'm sorry.

a real hoot to have around

such a fuckup.
