- lt doesn't go with anything.
Nothing goes with weinrib.
- well, okay, okay.

150
00:09:06,235 --> 00:09:08,726
what about something simple
like, you know, Ben ?

151
00:09:08,805 --> 00:09:10,932
- You want to call him Ben weinrib ?

- Shane's pretty.
- Shane would be okay.

166
00:09:48,044 --> 00:09:52,105
On the other hand, you wouldn't want
a Supreme Court Justice called Shane.

Oh, Jesus.

- Little tongue.
- Rabbi Max-- Rabbi Max weinrib ?

177
00:10:18,141 --> 00:10:20,632

- He's so smart.
- Yeah.

He picks up on everything.

00:11:01,951 --> 00:11:05,614
He's got a great personality.
You know, you wake him up,
he's always smiling and upbeat.

Listen, when are you going
to move the gallery downtown ?

Yeah. And l got a couple more things
on the way in, you know.

Hmm, l don't know.

we moved 'cause-- 'cause, you know,
'cause your mother wanted to move.

'Cause, you know, the art gallery

You have to ask that ?

- Hello ? Oh, hi.
- it's amazing.

238

- His vocabulary is good,
but his syntax is--

239
00:13:38,574 --> 00:13:40,508
- Oh, great.
- He speaks like a grown-up.

for dinner at Le Cirque ?

243
00:13:48,617 --> 00:13:52,018
The Dorians ? No. Because we have
tickets to the Edward Albee play.

Can we not discuss it now ?

250
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:10,738
Oh, my God !
That was embarrassing.

251

well, just because l don't
want to have dinner yet again
with the world's dullest couple.

00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:33,092
well, my mind wandered.
l can't keep on those topics.

00:14:33,162 --> 00:14:36,962
l just don't want to be the motor power
of the Bender Gallery forever.

l want the
Amanda Sloane Gallery.

to Le Cirque with the Dorians.

271
00:15:06,362 --> 00:15:10,230
And then last night it was
with the Grossbards on Park Avenue.

272
00:15:10,299 --> 00:15:13,928
And then after that,
we were driving home...

00:15:14,003 --> 00:15:15,937
and l don't know
what to say.

274

and l see some guy and this pretty girl.

they're walking home and, you know,

the Sunday papers.

in our first apartment,
you know, how romantic it was.

282

You know, in those days it was
just a kick shopping together...

283

or, you know, just walking
the New York streets, you know.

00:15:53,509 --> 00:15:58,003
l don't know, it's been so long
since there's been, you know,
the old passion between us.

287
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,447
l don't know, but it was the first time
l had any of those thoughts.

288
00:16:01,517 --> 00:16:04,145
And, you know,
they made me feel nervous.

289
00:16:06,856 --> 00:16:09,586
You weren't too pleasant
this evening.

290
00:16:09,658 --> 00:16:12,957
why, 'cause l said no about going
to your boss Jerry Bender's house...

291
00:16:13,028 --> 00:16:14,962
- in the Hamptons ?
- l'll be fine.

292
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:17,123
l don't like the Hamptons. You know,
you used to hate the beach yourself.

Yeah, not the way he lives.
lt's private and beautiful.

so angry about ?

- Last time we went, l got a tick.

296
00:16:23,906 --> 00:16:26,966
- A tick ? Oh, wow. Big deal.
- For you, it wasn't a big deal.

297
00:16:27,042 --> 00:16:29,840
- But l took my pants off, l had
a black thing living in my leg.
- Everyone will be there.

298
00:16:29,912 --> 00:16:31,937
For the potential contacts,
l can put up with a few ticks.

00:16:32,014 --> 00:16:33,948
l don't-- what contacts ?

300

You know, it's like you're
an international spy.

301

- You got contacts all over town.
- l plan to have my own gallery,
and soon.

You've changed unbelievably
over the years.

- Oh, yeah ? You know what, Lenny ?
- You used to hate that.

- People grow. They grow. Some people.
- lt's not growth.

305

You used to hate the beach.
And Jerry Bender has got a crush on you.

what?

307
00:16:50,099 --> 00:16:52,033

- Oh, no. That's nuts.

308
00:16:52,101 --> 00:16:54,035
- That's seriously crazy.
- He mentally undresses you.

309

- That's his normal look.
- lt's not his normal look.

310
00:16:56,105 --> 00:16:58,539
- lf he looked at me that way
l'd hit him with a brick.
- Okay. Okay, let's--

311
00:16:58,607 --> 00:17:01,269
- Or kiss him on the lips, maybe.
- Let's drop this. Please ?

- l wasn't angry.

316
00:17:18,761 --> 00:17:21,696
l wasn't angry. You were fumbling
and l was getting out of the mood.

we haven't been doing it in a while.

beneath sea level here.
- Lenny, why rock the boat ?

You got a kid that you're crazy for.

Did l tell you about Max ?

325
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,984
They want to put him in a special class
because he's got a high lQ.

326
00:17:47,056 --> 00:17:49,149
Yeah, well, two bright parents.

00:17:49,225 --> 00:17:51,489
Yeah, whoever they are.

from good stock.

he's got a great personality.

The thought's been put into my head.

340
00:18:25,761 --> 00:18:29,754
Oh, cursed fate. Certain thoughts
are better left unthunk.

341
00:18:29,832 --> 00:18:32,323
l'll bet this kid
has a dynamite mother.

342
00:18:32,401 --> 00:18:35,131
what makes you think he didn't
inherit everything from his father ?

343

l'm somewhat friendly with Amanda.

But it was not that long ago
that we-- that we did it.

350
00:18:59,561 --> 00:19:02,587
l recall trying to
expedite matters for her.

351
00:19:02,665 --> 00:19:07,227
l somehow think it was
a single parent with no father.

to you. May l ask why you want to know ?

00:45:03,924 --> 00:45:07,018
- followed by Marcy's Pride,
True Blue Crew, Classic Alert,
- l had it spent already !

858
00:45:07,094 --> 00:45:09,392
- l know. Relax, relax. Relax, will ya ?
- and Eager Beaver was last.

859
00:45:09,463 --> 00:45:12,432
You know, it's not so terrible.
l told you it was a long shot.

860
00:45:12,499 --> 00:45:14,626
- l never have any luck. Never !
- All right.

861
00:45:14,702 --> 00:45:17,170
l never won a fucking thing
in my entire life ! Nothing ! Never !

862
00:45:17,238 --> 00:45:20,765
will you stay calm ?
You gotta learn to be a graceful loser.

863
00:45:20,841 --> 00:45:23,901
lf it's the money,
l'll lend you the money.

864
00:45:23,978 --> 00:45:25,912
- l can help you.
- No, it's not the money, Lenny.

865
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:29,245
l don't care about the money.
l just wanted to win so badly.

866
00:45:29,316 --> 00:45:32,444
what do you want to win for ?
we're just out here having a good time.

867
00:45:32,519 --> 00:45:34,783
- You gotta--
- 'Cause l wanted to impress you.

868
00:45:34,855 --> 00:45:38,154
lmpress me ? what ? You know,
you're not running in the race.

869
00:45:38,225 --> 00:45:40,489
what-- You don't
have to impress me. l'm--

870
00:45:40,561 --> 00:45:43,086
Yeah, but l wanted to show you
l could pick a winner.

871
00:45:43,163 --> 00:45:46,655
Hey. Listen, my horse
didn't win either, you know.

872
00:45:46,734 --> 00:45:48,668
Come on, you--
you do impress me.

873
00:45:48,736 --> 00:45:52,331
You're attractive, you're--
you're quick, you have a lot of energy.

874
00:45:52,406 --> 00:45:54,840
- You're obviously
a state-of-the-art fellatrix.
- what ?

875
00:45:54,909 --> 00:45:57,673
So-- Nothing, nothing.
l'm impressed. Take--

876
00:45:57,745 --> 00:45:59,679
- Lenny, don't say ''nothing.''
- l'm impressed.

877
00:45:59,747 --> 00:46:02,113
- You think l'm stupid ?
- l don't think you're stupid, no.

878
00:46:02,182 --> 00:46:04,616
- No ?
- You know, l think you do
a stupid thing with your life.

879
00:46:04,685 --> 00:46:06,619
But l told you that already.

880
00:46:06,687 --> 00:46:09,121
well, l don't understand
why it matters so much to you.

881
00:46:09,189 --> 00:46:12,386
Hey, come on. we'll stay for one more
race, and this time l'll bet for you.

882
00:46:12,459 --> 00:46:14,552
- Yeah ?
- Let me make the bet.
Yeah. N-No. Come on.

883
00:46:14,628 --> 00:46:16,687
- we'll just go to the window
and l'll make one bet.
- All right.

884
00:46:16,764 --> 00:46:18,823
Please don't pick one
that runs second...

885
00:46:18,899 --> 00:46:20,833
- 'cause l want a winner, okay, Len ?
- Yeah. Hey.

886
00:46:20,901 --> 00:46:24,302
You know, they give these horses saliva
tests. l can't guarantee anything.

887
00:46:27,942 --> 00:46:30,638
- l gave you your winnings, right ?
- Yeah.

888
00:46:30,711 --> 00:46:34,442
That was a great race.
Too bad the horse only paid 40 cents.

889
00:46:34,515 --> 00:46:37,484
well, he was a heavy favorite, you know,
and l bet him to come in third.

890
00:46:37,551 --> 00:46:40,418
- At least this way you get something.
- Yeah.

891
00:46:40,487 --> 00:46:42,421
So, you wanna come in ?

892
00:46:42,489 --> 00:46:45,652
l gotta go home.
l got a wife and kid. You know, l can't.

893
00:46:45,726 --> 00:46:49,753
You know, you only talk about me.
You never talk about yourself.

894
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:53,231
lt's late for me. You know,
l had a great time, but l gotta go.

895
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:55,564
l feel l owe you a great fuck.

896
00:46:55,636 --> 00:46:59,663
Hey, do me a favor. Go upstairs,
rest your ulcer, stay in tonight.

897
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:02,368
l can't stay in.
l got six dates.

898
00:47:02,443 --> 00:47:04,434
Six dates.
Slow night for you, right ?

899
00:47:04,511 --> 00:47:08,709
l wish l had the penicillin concession
in your apartment. l'd-- l'd be wealthy.

900
00:47:08,782 --> 00:47:11,444
All right.
So, you're gonna call me again ?

901
00:47:11,518 --> 00:47:14,112
Am l gonna call you again ?
Yeah, l'll call you. Don't worry.

902
00:47:14,188 --> 00:47:16,452
- You promise ?
- l will. l'll call you again.

903
00:47:16,523 --> 00:47:18,718
Okay. l had a great time.

904
00:47:18,792 --> 00:47:20,726
- Bye.
- Okay.

905
00:47:20,794 --> 00:47:22,728
whew.

906
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:34,874
- ?? [ Piano ]
- [ Chattering ]

907
00:47:34,942 --> 00:47:37,274
- Congratulations.
- Thirty-five years.

908
00:47:37,344 --> 00:47:39,278
- l never thought we'd make it.
- You and Amanda...

909
00:47:39,346 --> 00:47:41,280
have a way to go,
but you'll make it.

910
00:47:41,348 --> 00:47:43,475
- You guys look so young, both of you.
- Yeah, you do.

911
00:47:43,550 --> 00:47:45,484
well, we've kept
each other young.

912
00:47:45,552 --> 00:47:48,146
Your mother could be your sister,
and you could be brother and sister.

913
00:47:48,222 --> 00:47:51,157
- You could be my-- yes.
- l don't know where that
puts me, but anyway--

914
00:47:55,095 --> 00:47:57,586
She looks so beautiful,
doesn't she, Lenny ?

915
00:47:57,664 --> 00:47:59,757
- To me, she always looks beautiful.
- Mmm.

916
00:47:59,833 --> 00:48:01,767
-l just always find her great. And you--
-[ Laughing ]

917
00:48:01,835 --> 00:48:04,770
when l said sisters before, l mean it.
You guys look so great.

918
00:48:04,838 --> 00:48:07,363
And it's a wonder,
with all the responsibility...

919
00:48:07,441 --> 00:48:09,773
she has opening
her new gallery.

920
00:48:09,843 --> 00:48:12,403
- lt's a lot of work.
- what new gallery ? A new gallery ?

921
00:48:12,479 --> 00:48:15,107
No, l didn't tell you 'cause,
you know, l don't know until
it's a hundred percent definite.

922
00:48:15,182 --> 00:48:17,446
- well, did l say the wrong thing ?
- But it's not.

923
00:48:17,518 --> 00:48:20,112
- No, sure. No, l just--
- lt's a hundred percent definite.

924
00:48:20,187 --> 00:48:22,212
You're so insecure.
lt's happening.

925
00:48:22,289 --> 00:48:25,781
- [ Laughter ]
- Oh, excuse me.

926
00:48:25,859 --> 00:48:28,293
- what is the story on this ?
- lt looks like l have the backing,

927
00:48:28,362 --> 00:48:30,296
but it's not totally definite.

928
00:48:30,364 --> 00:48:32,298
- That's why l didn't say anything.
- Your mother said it was definite.

929
00:48:32,366 --> 00:48:34,459
Yeah, well. lt seems as if
l do have the backing.

930
00:48:34,535 --> 00:48:37,197
And there is this wonderful space
on Vesey Street. You know it ?

931
00:48:37,271 --> 00:48:39,466
- Vesey ? Yeah, l know it.
- Yeah, down in Soho.

932
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:42,941
And it looks like, you know,
we think we can get it.

933
00:48:43,010 --> 00:48:45,911
The Dorians are putting in
some money, but l--

934
00:48:45,979 --> 00:48:47,913
- well, don't look so happy about it.
- l am happy !

935
00:48:47,981 --> 00:48:51,212
l'm very happy for you, but it's
the first l'm hearing of it, you know.

936
00:48:51,285 --> 00:48:53,719
- And for your mother to tell me--
- Yeah, well, look.

937
00:48:53,787 --> 00:48:56,381
l realize that for a time l'm going
to be busier than usual...

938
00:48:56,457 --> 00:48:58,721
and l know that's
a sore point,

939
00:48:58,792 --> 00:49:01,727
but, you know, it'll be only
'til it gets off the ground.

940
00:49:01,795 --> 00:49:04,229
- Hey, l'm happy for you. l re--
- You are ?

941
00:49:04,298 --> 00:49:06,596
- Yes. l just would have
liked to have known it.
- Are you sure ?

942
00:49:06,667 --> 00:49:09,465
- The Amanda Sloane Gallery.
l think that it's great.
- Yeah, on Vesey Street.

943
00:49:09,536 --> 00:49:12,972
Believe me.
l haven't even told Jerry Bender yet.

944
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,476
''You've got a fine right, you have,
after the way you treated Mother,

945
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:18,773
''after the way you treated us all !

946
00:49:18,846 --> 00:49:22,179
''A fine right you've got to come back
in here in your best country manner...

947
00:49:22,249 --> 00:49:25,878
''and strike attitudes
and make stands...

948
00:49:25,953 --> 00:49:28,615
''and criticize my fiance
and give orders...

949
00:49:28,689 --> 00:49:30,919
''and mess things up generally
as if you'd done--

950
00:49:30,991 --> 00:49:32,959
''well, l can't help it.
lt's sickening !

951
00:49:33,026 --> 00:49:35,961
As if he'd done nothing at all !

952
00:49:38,999 --> 00:49:40,933
well ?

953
00:49:41,001 --> 00:49:42,935
what do you think ?

954
00:49:43,003 --> 00:49:45,801
- About what ?
- About me.

955
00:49:45,873 --> 00:49:49,001
- You think l'm any good ?
- Yes, it's fine.

956
00:49:49,076 --> 00:49:51,010
l-- You know, you're asking
the wrong person.

957
00:49:51,078 --> 00:49:53,069
l don't know that much about acting,
to tell you the truth.

958
00:49:53,147 --> 00:49:55,081
Oh, l can tell
you're not too impressed.

959
00:49:55,149 --> 00:49:58,414
No, no, no. l just thought, you know,
it's a very odd part for you to choose.

960
00:49:58,485 --> 00:50:01,420
- why ?
- well, you know, 'cause
it's The Philadelphia Story.

961
00:50:01,488 --> 00:50:04,514
- But l lived in Philadelphia.
- what has that got to do with it ?

962
00:50:04,591 --> 00:50:08,994
- l know the city.
- what ? You pick a part like this--

963
00:50:09,062 --> 00:50:12,429
You should get something
closer to yourself.
lt wouldn't be such a struggle.

964
00:50:12,499 --> 00:50:14,592
- You know.
- well, what part should l play ?

965
00:50:14,668 --> 00:50:17,102
You know-- l don't know.
Something closer.

966
00:50:17,171 --> 00:50:19,765
Clint Eastwood doesn't play
a meek little hairdresser.

967
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:22,104
well, l could play
a hairdresser.

968
00:50:22,176 --> 00:50:24,440
l-l used to--
l used to do it a lot.

969
00:50:24,511 --> 00:50:26,445
l wanted to be one.
l was very good at it.

970
00:50:26,513 --> 00:50:29,107
- So why'd you give it up ?
- well, l don't know.

971
00:50:29,183 --> 00:50:31,117
One thing led to another.

972
00:50:31,185 --> 00:50:33,210
You know, my aunt worked
in a beauty parlor for years.

973
00:50:33,287 --> 00:50:35,847
She loved it.

974
00:50:35,923 --> 00:50:38,858
wait. You mean
not be an actress ?

975
00:50:38,926 --> 00:50:41,724
well, an actress
is a very tough life, you know.

976
00:50:41,795 --> 00:50:44,593
- But a hairdresser
could always make a buck.
- A buck ?

977
00:50:44,665 --> 00:50:47,463
A buck ! An honest buck.
No beatings, no AlDS.

978
00:50:47,534 --> 00:50:49,468
You can meet somebody
that you, you know--

979
00:50:49,536 --> 00:50:52,801
You can get a family, have a real life,
someone that cares for you.

980
00:50:52,873 --> 00:50:54,807
Hey !

981
00:50:54,875 --> 00:50:57,469
Now, don't you think that l want
to meet somebody and get married...

982
00:50:57,544 --> 00:50:59,808
and get the hell
out of the rat race ?

983
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:02,974
l would like to move away
and become a mother and just raise kids.

984
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:04,984
l don't even want
to be a hairdresser.

985
00:51:05,052 --> 00:51:07,418
lf Clint Eastwood wants
to be a hairdresser, just let him.

986
00:51:07,487 --> 00:51:11,423
You missed the point. Clint Eastwood
doesn't want to be a hairdresser.

987
00:51:11,491 --> 00:51:14,016
l had a kid, Lenny,

988
00:51:14,094 --> 00:51:16,528
and l gave him up
for adoption.

989
00:51:18,098 --> 00:51:22,535
lt's the sorriest thing
l ever did in my entire life.

990
00:51:23,937 --> 00:51:27,031
There's not a day
that doesn't go by that l don't...

991
00:51:27,107 --> 00:51:30,099
wake up thinking
about him.

992
00:51:30,177 --> 00:51:32,441
Now some lucky family
has him.

993
00:51:32,512 --> 00:51:35,948
l just hope to God that they're
taking good care of him.

994
00:51:37,451 --> 00:51:40,113
why'd you give him up ?

995
00:51:40,187 --> 00:51:42,951
l don't know. l was--
l was all confused.

996
00:51:43,023 --> 00:51:46,220
l had no dough. l-l--
l didn't know what to do.

997
00:51:46,293 --> 00:51:48,352
l--

998
00:51:48,428 --> 00:51:50,362
l didn't even know
who the father was.

999
00:51:50,430 --> 00:51:53,126
lt could've been any one
of a hundred guys.

1000
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:56,135
welcome to planet Earth,
thanks to a broken condom.

1001
00:51:58,572 --> 00:52:02,406
Gee. That's tough.

1002
00:52:04,311 --> 00:52:06,245
Um.

1003
00:52:07,447 --> 00:52:09,972
what about your kid ?

1004
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:13,178
Max ? M-M-Ma-- You know.
Max is the greatest.

1005
00:52:13,253 --> 00:52:15,414
- Yeah ?
- well, sure.

1006
00:52:15,489 --> 00:52:18,151
Do you have
a picture of him ?

1007
00:52:18,225 --> 00:52:21,922
- A picture of Max ?
- Yeah. l'd like to see him.

1008
00:52:21,995 --> 00:52:23,929
Oh.

1009
00:52:23,997 --> 00:52:26,431
Uh, yeah, l guess l--

1010
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:36,832
[ Chuckles ]
Oh.

1011
00:52:36,910 --> 00:52:38,844
[ Chuckles ]

1012
00:52:38,912 --> 00:52:42,473
He's very sweet. He--
[ Chuckles ]

1013
00:52:42,549 --> 00:52:44,483
You're very lucky.

1014
00:52:44,551 --> 00:52:46,519
[ Chorus Leader ]
with Amanda, it was fate.

1015
00:52:46,586 --> 00:52:48,645
with Linda, it's hubris.

1016
00:52:48,722 --> 00:52:53,216
His drive to find out, and now,
to change her life, to control her.

1017
00:52:53,293 --> 00:52:55,261
- [ Chorus ] Yes.
- [ Cassandra ] Danger.

1018
00:52:55,329 --> 00:52:58,765
wait. wait,
l see... danger.

1019
00:52:58,832 --> 00:53:02,495
Hey, wait a minute. l don't have
any interest in controlling her.

1020
00:53:02,569 --> 00:53:04,594
l'm doing this for Max's sake.

1021
00:53:04,671 --> 00:53:08,334
when the kid gets older, inevitably
he's gonna trace his mother.

1022
00:53:08,408 --> 00:53:10,672
And, you know, l'd be happier...

1023
00:53:10,744 --> 00:53:14,043
if she was married and a--
a hairdresser, you know,

1024
00:53:14,114 --> 00:53:17,049
rather than the star
of The Enchanted Pussy.

1025
00:53:17,117 --> 00:53:21,110
Danger ! l see horrible,
horrible danger !

1026
00:53:21,188 --> 00:53:24,919
- Terrible danger !
- Hey, l can handle myself emotionally.

1027
00:53:24,991 --> 00:53:28,518
Not emotional danger,
physical danger.

1028
00:53:28,595 --> 00:53:31,962
l see a bald man.
He has a lead pipe.

1029
00:53:32,032 --> 00:53:34,466
He's breaking your kneecaps.

1030
00:53:40,807 --> 00:53:43,469
So, so, uh, what did, uh--
How did Jerry Bender take it...

1031
00:53:43,543 --> 00:53:46,068
when you said that
the decision was final ?

1032
00:53:46,146 --> 00:53:48,137
You know what ?
He was amazing.

1033
00:53:48,215 --> 00:53:52,276
l thought he'd be upset, but no,
he was very excited and very supportive.

1034
00:53:52,352 --> 00:53:55,219
No, he's being--
He was absolutely great about it.

1035
00:53:55,288 --> 00:53:58,280
Anyway, l-l'm calling to say
l can't make dinner tonight.

1036
00:53:58,358 --> 00:54:00,223
Oh, you're kidding.
lt's gonna be great.

1037
00:54:00,293 --> 00:54:04,491
Everybody in the Madison Square Garden
organization's gonna be there.

1038
00:54:04,564 --> 00:54:06,498
Look, there's no way
l can get away.

1039
00:54:06,566 --> 00:54:09,592
The architects are here
and the Dorians are in town from Paris.

1040
00:54:09,669 --> 00:54:13,503
And, uh, the architects fly back
to Milan tonight. l can't.

1041
00:54:13,573 --> 00:54:16,838
All right, well. [ Coughs ]
l'll tell you what.

1042
00:54:16,910 --> 00:54:19,504
what l'll do is, l'll go home
and l'll put Max to sleep.

1043
00:54:19,579 --> 00:54:21,604
l'll spend a little time
there and then--

1044
00:54:21,681 --> 00:54:23,945
Then-- Oh.

1045
00:54:24,017 --> 00:54:26,952
Uh, look, let me--
l'm gonna call you back. l got, uh--

1046
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:29,420
l'm gonna call you back.
Oh, geez.

1047
00:54:29,489 --> 00:54:31,423
- [ woman ]
lt's just against our policy--
- [ Linda ] l understand !

1048
00:54:31,491 --> 00:54:33,425
- lf you wanna wait right here.
- whatever.

1049
00:54:33,493 --> 00:54:35,427
-Lenny, there's someone here to see you.
-Lenny !

1050
00:54:35,495 --> 00:54:38,020
- [ Lenny ] Uh, yes.
Uh, c-c-come in. Come in.
- Lenny !

1051
00:54:38,098 --> 00:54:40,623
- Th-This is Miss Gildersleeve.
She's an acquaintance.
- You know her ?

1052
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:43,134
- Gildersleeve ?
- Yes, Miss-- Miss Gildersleeve.

1053
00:54:43,203 --> 00:54:46,297
we're old-- lt's okay. lt's okay.
l'll be in here.

1054
00:54:46,373 --> 00:54:48,807
- You don't need anything ?
- No, no ! l'm fine.

1055
00:54:48,875 --> 00:54:50,809
- Okay.
- l'm fine.

1056
00:54:50,877 --> 00:54:53,471
- what are you doing here ?
- Lenny ? Lenny, l got to talk to you.

1057
00:54:53,547 --> 00:54:55,879
Ricky threatened to-- to--
to hurt me. He--

1058
00:54:55,949 --> 00:54:59,544
- who's Ricky ?
- He takes a percentage of my work.

1059
00:54:59,619 --> 00:55:03,180
- He's a pimp, right ?
- No, he's like
a business representative.

1060
00:55:03,256 --> 00:55:05,417
what do you need a business repre--
You-- You--

1061
00:55:05,492 --> 00:55:08,757
All you need is a mattress
and a couple of garter belts.
You're not a conglomerate.

1062
00:55:08,829 --> 00:55:11,093
Lenny, he said he
was going to cut me up...

1063
00:55:11,164 --> 00:55:13,598
because l told him l didn't
want to work anymore.

1064
00:55:13,667 --> 00:55:17,228
[ Sighs ] well, l think it's a great
idea that you want to phase out.

1065
00:55:17,304 --> 00:55:19,363
- He has no qualms about killing me.
- Ohh.

1066
00:55:19,439 --> 00:55:21,600
Listen, we'll call the police.
That's not a big deal.

1067
00:55:21,675 --> 00:55:24,269
How can l call the police
with my setup ?

1068
00:55:24,344 --> 00:55:27,040
You know, l told you
a thousand times...

1069
00:55:27,113 --> 00:55:29,172
you're in a hazardous business.

1070
00:55:29,249 --> 00:55:31,615
So that's what happens.
Now, so-- Don't go outside.

1071
00:55:31,685 --> 00:55:34,813
l'm not going outside. l thought,
just maybe, if you could talk to him.

1072
00:55:34,888 --> 00:55:37,356
- Me ? what, are you nuts ?
- Yeah, because--

1073
00:55:37,424 --> 00:55:40,120
Because you're smart and bright
and you got a way with words.

1074
00:55:40,193 --> 00:55:42,388
l can't talk to him.
l don't even know the guy.

1075
00:55:42,462 --> 00:55:45,397
Yeah, well, he knows it was your idea
that l get out of the business.

1076
00:55:45,465 --> 00:55:47,524
So he said he's gonna
kill you too.

1077
00:55:47,601 --> 00:55:50,297
- He said he was gonna kill me ?
- Yeah, 'cause it was your idea.

1078
00:55:50,370 --> 00:55:54,329
He's gonna cut up my face
and put a bullet between your eyes.

1079
00:55:54,407 --> 00:55:57,934
Really ? Did he--
Did he specify the caliber ?

1080
00:55:58,011 --> 00:56:01,412
Listen, l just thought maybe
you could just reason with him.

1081
00:56:01,481 --> 00:56:04,450
No, l can't.
l-- Listen, l never told you this,

1082
00:56:04,518 --> 00:56:07,078
but l got a-- a slight
heart murmur...

1083
00:56:07,153 --> 00:56:09,485
and right now
it's murmuring ''hide.''

1084
00:56:09,556 --> 00:56:11,490
- l don't believe you're a coward.
- [ Stammering ]

1085
00:56:11,558 --> 00:56:14,254
Only in actuality.
Um, this is not for me.

1086
00:56:14,327 --> 00:56:17,091
- Lenny, l need your help.
- No, l'm not a violence person.

1087
00:56:17,163 --> 00:56:21,099
l-l write about hockey and boxing
and football. This is not my world.

1088
00:56:21,167 --> 00:56:24,330
Lenny, l do want to quit like you said,
but he said he's not gonna let me !

1089
00:56:24,404 --> 00:56:27,032
- He's gonna hurt us both. Please !
- Relax, relax.

1090
00:56:27,107 --> 00:56:30,099
what do you want me to do ?
How am l gonna talk to him ?

1091
00:56:30,176 --> 00:56:32,110
- well, okay. You just--
- l--

1092
00:56:32,178 --> 00:56:35,443
You just talk because you're smarter
than he is and stronger than he is.

1093
00:56:35,515 --> 00:56:38,279
You're a much better man. So just
remember that when you talk to him.

1094
00:56:38,351 --> 00:56:42,117
He's a little bit intimidating.
He's got a bald head and an earring.

1095
00:56:42,188 --> 00:56:45,248
- But you'll win. l know you will.
- Jesus, l-- l--

1096
00:56:45,325 --> 00:56:47,452
You're a good man, Lenny.
You'll win.

1097
00:56:47,527 --> 00:56:49,461
Look, in case anything
comes up,

1098
00:56:49,529 --> 00:56:53,693
l want you to know that l-l'm
type O-positive, okay ?

1099
00:56:53,767 --> 00:56:56,793
[ Man On Radio ]
Derek, l got the feeling you
came here and obviously moved...

1100
00:56:56,870 --> 00:56:58,804
into this whole Knick persona.

1101
00:56:58,872 --> 00:57:01,466
- Did you get caught up, maybe,
with a little bit of this Knick,
- Excuse me.

1102
00:57:01,541 --> 00:57:03,907
''l gotta be physical,
l gotta be tough,'' and maybe--

1103
00:57:03,977 --> 00:57:05,911
l'm, uh, l'm
Lenny Gildersleeve.

1104
00:57:05,979 --> 00:57:09,244
l-- l'm a friend
of Linda-- Linda Ash's.

1105
00:57:09,316 --> 00:57:12,752
And, uh, l thought
that perhaps we could--

1106
00:57:12,819 --> 00:57:14,753
See--
[ Clears Throat ]

1107
00:57:14,821 --> 00:57:17,085
what l want to discuss
with you is that...

1108
00:57:17,157 --> 00:57:20,183
there comes a time in the life
of every young woman,

1109
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:22,319
not just Linda, but everyone,

1110
00:57:22,395 --> 00:57:26,161
that they-- they want to perhaps
make a change in their life.

1111
00:57:26,232 --> 00:57:29,759
They maybe want to settle down
or explore alternative lifestyles.

1112
00:57:29,836 --> 00:57:33,602
l don't think you've been a very good
influence on Linda, Mr. weinrib.

1113
00:57:33,673 --> 00:57:37,973
weinrib. Right. So Gildersleeve
is a name l use for business purposes.

1114
00:57:38,044 --> 00:57:40,444
- l got an investment in Linda.
- No question.

1115
00:57:40,513 --> 00:57:43,038
l honor that. But--
But by now, she's probably...

1116
00:57:43,116 --> 00:57:45,107
repaid you tenfold
or twentyfold or--

1117
00:57:45,185 --> 00:57:48,382
Don't be so fuckin' sure, 'cause you
don't know what the fuckin' numbers are!

1118
00:57:48,455 --> 00:57:51,447
That's a point well taken.
Excuse me, you're-- you're-- Excuse me.

1119
00:57:51,524 --> 00:57:54,220
l-l-l understand what you're saying.
ls that a Pellegrino ?

1120
00:57:54,294 --> 00:57:57,525
Can l-- Because you've
bent my throat now a little bit.

1121
00:57:57,597 --> 00:58:00,430
And, uh, the windpipe used to
hang straight until this moment.

1122
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:02,434
The fuckin' Knicks suck !

1123
00:58:02,502 --> 00:58:04,436
They need a good shootin' forward.

1124
00:58:04,504 --> 00:58:06,563
Yes, well, there's gonna
be a three-way trade.

1125
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,574
l don't know if you guys
heard anything about it.

1126
00:58:08,642 --> 00:58:10,906
- Seattle, Atlanta
and the Knicks are talking.
- Bullshit.

1127
00:58:10,977 --> 00:58:13,070
- No, no, no. l kid you not.
l know. lt's in the air.
- Yeah ?

1128
00:58:13,146 --> 00:58:15,205
- They're discussing a trade.
- So what do you think about the Nets ?

1129
00:58:15,281 --> 00:58:17,306
- You think the Nets got a chance ?
- The Nets ? Yes, l do.

1130
00:58:17,384 --> 00:58:19,750
lf they're injury-free,
l think they have a good chance.

1131
00:58:19,819 --> 00:58:22,185
l like the Nets. l think they're
one or two years away, is all.

1132
00:58:22,255 --> 00:58:24,189
l would say two or three myself.

1133
00:58:24,257 --> 00:58:27,283
You see, we have a common interest,
the three of us.

1134
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:30,090
- what were we talking about ?
- Linda, Linda Ash.

1135
00:58:30,163 --> 00:58:33,428
Oh, yeah, yeah.
That girl's goin' no place.

1136
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:37,095
She walks on me, l'll disfigure her
and l'll fuckin' kill you.

1137
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:40,435
See, that's exactly what

in his beak, right ?

And then flies me, like, all over
the world so l see everything.

1474
01:16:16,261 --> 01:16:19,196
And then, like, he flies me
out of the country...

1475
01:16:19,264 --> 01:16:22,700
and, like, we go up to
the north pole and he drops me...

Yeah. l saw her.
She was workin' late at the gallery.

1506
01:18:03,602 --> 01:18:06,537
And with her was this,
uh, Jerry Bender guy.

1507
01:18:06,605 --> 01:18:09,540
well, that's nothing. She works
with Jerry Bender. Nothing unusual.

1508
01:18:09,608 --> 01:18:11,542
- You didn't let me finish.
- Go on.

1509
01:18:11,610 --> 01:18:13,544
Uh, they spoke
in intimate tones...

1510
01:18:13,612 --> 01:18:17,048
and then, uh, Bender rose
and laid a big wet one on her.

01:18:17,115 --> 01:18:20,050
- A big we-- Bender kissed Amanda ?

Hey, you must've known somethin'

1513
01:18:23,622 --> 01:18:26,056
Yeah, l always thought
that Bender had eyes for her.

1514
01:18:26,124 --> 01:18:28,058
Now he's got eyes and hands.

1515
01:18:28,126 --> 01:18:30,617
Jesus-- well, Amanda
didn't respond, did she ?

1516
01:18:30,696 --> 01:18:34,223
No. She just opened her mouth
very wide and stuck her tongue out...

1517
01:18:34,299 --> 01:18:37,860
as far as it was
humanly possible to go.

1518
01:18:37,936 --> 01:18:39,870
Jeez--
Are you sure ?

- Oh, no, not in front of Max !

1524

at his friend's house.

Ah, thank you.
God bless you.

Oh, my God !
lt's more serious than we thought !

01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:18,076
lt's very serious.
Her marriage to Lenny is in crisis.

1530
01:19:18,143 --> 01:19:22,477
with the passage of time,
even the strongest bonds become fragile.

1531

Great, fellas.
lt sounds like a fortune cookie.

l-l-l can't understand this.
wh-wh-- This is so radical.

1542
01:19:56,214 --> 01:19:58,648
No, 'cause l can't cheat.
Jerry Bender's in love with me.

1543
01:19:58,717 --> 01:20:00,651
This is crazy.

1544
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:04,655
Are you telling me you're in love with
him, you're in love with Jerry Bender ?

what do you mean ?
Are you in love with him or not ?

1548
01:20:13,231 --> 01:20:16,166
Anyway, Lenny, let's face it--
things have changed between us.

1549
01:20:16,234 --> 01:20:19,169
But we can fix things.
what about Max ? Max--

1550
01:20:19,237 --> 01:20:23,173
He'll be okay. Maybe it will
be better for him with us apart...

1551
01:20:23,241 --> 01:20:26,677
- instead of together
and arguing all of the time.
- That's crazy.

1552
01:20:26,745 --> 01:20:28,679
l just think that's crazy.

1553
01:20:29,815 --> 01:20:31,749
well, l-- l can't have
this conversation.

my thoughts together.

- You're in a very bad mood ?

1559
01:21:13,025 --> 01:21:16,961
How could you do this ? How could you
set me up with this stupid girl ?

1560
01:21:17,029 --> 01:21:20,965
- what are you talking about ?
- You didn't tell me she was a hooker...

1561
01:21:21,033 --> 01:21:24,969
and that she did porno films and had sex
with hundreds and hundreds of men...

1562
01:21:25,037 --> 01:21:27,972
and women and who the hell
knows what else !

1563
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:29,974
- l thought it would prejudice you.
