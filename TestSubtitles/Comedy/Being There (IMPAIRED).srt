How long?

317
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,952
I don't know.
We'll see what the doctor says.

[Bells ringing]

319
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:53,155
I've seen it done before,
in a film on television.

320
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,593
This won't hurt at all.

321
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,595
It did hurt.

322
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:03,392
There's no apparent damage to the bone.
But to be sure, we'll do an x-ray.

323
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,835
X-ray?

324
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,629
By the way, Mr. Gardiner,
I'd like to ask you something straight out.

325
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,438
-Straight out?
-Yes, sir.

326
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,190
Are you planning on making
any sort of claim against the Rands?

327
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,715
Claim.

328
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,112
That's what Thomas asked me.

329
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,919
Thomas?
You can pull your trousers up now.

330
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,832
Who's Thomas?

331
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,876
Thomas Franklin. He's an attorney.

332
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,679
-An attorney?
-Yes.

333
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,078
Then you wish to handle this matter
through your attorneys?

334
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,830
There's no need for a claim.

335
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,756
I don't even know what they look like.

336
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,915
ALLENBY: Well, then.

337
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,388
You caught me off guard there,
I must admit.

338
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,875
Thank you.

339
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:04,710
ALLENBY: Now, the only thing we have
to look out for is minor hemorrhaging...

340
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,633
...which isn't serious,
but could cause trouble later on.

341
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,631
Tell me, Mr. Gardiner...

342
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:13,112
...would it be possible for you
to stay here for a day or two...

343
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,599
...so we could keep an eye on it?

344
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,557
Yes, I could stay here.

345
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,359
-Does this house have a garden?
-Why, yes. Many.

346
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,636
Good.

347
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,154
Keep your weight off that leg,
Mr. Gardiner.

348
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,799
Mr. Wilson, wheel Mr. Gardiner in
for x-rays after you've finished unpacking.

WlLSON: Yes, Doctor.
ALLENBY: Thank you.

Ever watch a game on TV and see
the players chugging down this stuff?

I miss you so when I'm out.
How're you feeling?

EVE: No headaches?

354
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,277
No, it's been a fairly good day.

355
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,151
RAND: Better than yours, so I've been told.
EVE: You heard about it?

356
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,673
I may be a shut-in, but....

357
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,271
I'm sorry you had to go through all that.

358
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:11,511
It was nothing, really.
It just sounded worse than it was.

359
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,753
EVE: And Mr. Gardiner
is a very reasonable man.

360
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,109
Reasonable....

361
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,598
I'd like to meet a reasonable man
for a change.

Why don't you ask this Robinson
for dinner?

Gardiner. Gardiner. Chauncey.
Chauncey Gardiner.

RAND: Gardiner.

You think you're well enough
for dinner, Ben?

366
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,234
Constance, I want fresh blood for dinner.

367
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,829
Yes, sir.

368
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,710
I'll have them set another place.

How's Mr. Gardiner?

374
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,756
Doesn't seem to be too serious.

375
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:22,196
But it's a rather large contusion
and I'd like to keep an eye on him...

376
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,078
...so I suggested that he stay here
for a couple of days.

EVE: Here?

378
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,839
Mr. Gardiner stay here? Why?
Is that necessary?

379
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,716
Not necessary, but helpful.

380
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,232
ALLENBY: Don't worry,
he might be a breath of fresh air.

00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,909
Perhaps.

Actually, I found him to have
quite a sense of humor.

No, sir. I don't believe I do.

Yes, sir?

A small black man
gave me a message for Raphael.

Yes.

436

Shut down and closed by the attorneys.

That's exactly what I mean.

Isn't that what any businessman is?
A gardener.

He...

456
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,799
...works on...

457
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,993
...flinty soil...

458
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,598
...to make it productive...

459
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,156
...with the labor of his own hands.

460
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,992
He waters it...

461
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,836
...with the sweat of his own brow.

462
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,797
He makes a thing of value for his family...

463
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,632
...and for the community.

464
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:41,159
Yes, indeed, Chauncey,
a productive businessman...

465
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,673
...is a laborer in the vineyard.

466

I know exactly what you mean.

467
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,879
The garden that I left was such a place.

468
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:00,756
I don't have that anymore. All I have left...

469
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,272
...is the room upstairs.

470
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,594
Come on, now, wait a minute, Chauncey.

471

You've got your health.

bastards get you down. You've got to fight.

473
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,196
I don't want to hear anymore from you
about that room upstairs.

474

477
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,511
I'm sure it is.
That's what they say, anyway.

478
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,395
You know...

479
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:59,189
...there are thousands of businessmen,
large and small...

480
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,959
...in your situation.

481
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,469
I've...

482
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:09,636
...given the matter a good deal
of consideration for some time.

483

They've been harassed long enough by...

...inflation, increased taxation...

485
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,711
...all sorts of indecencies.

486
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:24,556
After all, they're our strongest defense
against the pollutants...

...of our basic freedoms...

...as well as the well-being
of our middle class.

I've been thinking about starting
a financial assistance fund.

00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:44,313
Tell me, would you have any ideas
on that subject?

491

Reluctant to speak, eh?

00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,478
I can understand that.

494
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,591
After a man's lost everything...

495
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:04,390
...anger tends to block out rationality,
for a while.

496

But, you work on the idea.

497

Chauncey, there you are.
What are you doing on that leg?

It's fine today, Robert.

I've got my hands full.

Anyway, the President's volunteered
to sit in for Ben at the convention.

00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,077
Quite a nice gesture.
They're due here soon, I believe.

-You do, do you?
-Yes.

547
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:17,629
Ben would like me to meet the President.

-He would, would he?
-Yes.

It's 9:10, now.

And if you don't see a clock...

...I'm sure someone will have the time.

-Yes.

I asked Nurse Teresa to fix me up a bit.

568
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:46,554
I didn't want the President to think
I would die while he was talking to me.

00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:48,595
I see.

570

Nobody likes a dying man.

571
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:55,031
Because nobody knows what death is.

572

You seem to be an exception.

That's one of the things I admire
about you, your admirable balance.

...not to misuse that power.

595
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:52,356
It's extremely important
that we don't allow ourselves...

596
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:56,319
...to become blinded to the needs
of our government...

Overall, pretty good.

But I think, Mr. President,
that it is very dangerous...

-...you don't think I should take the chance.
-Absolutely not.

634
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:25,274
Do you agree with Ben, or do you think
we can stimulate growth through...

635
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:28,158
...temporary incentives?

636
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:42,073
As long as the roots are not severed...

637
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:44,348
...all is well.

638
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:46,718
And all will be well...

639
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:48,959
...in the garden.

640
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:56,112
-ln the garden?
-Yes.

641
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:06,470
In a garden, growth has its season.

642
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:11,191
First comes spring and summer...

643
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:13,838
...but then we have...

644
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:16,557
...fall and winter.

645
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:20,751
And then we get spring and summer again.

646
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:27,992
-Spring and summer?
-Yes.

647
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:32,671
-And fall and winter?
-Yes.

648
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:44,149
I think what our insightful
young friend is saying...

649
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:48,670
...is that we welcome the inevitable...

650
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,638
...seasons of nature...

651
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:55,038
...but we're upset by the seasons
of our economy.

652
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:56,435
Yes.

653
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:59,110
There will be growth in the spring.

654
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:08,554
I must admit, that is one of the most
refreshing and optimistic statements...

655
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,710
...I've heard in a very long time.

656
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:15,791
I admire your good, solid sense.

657
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:18,874
That's precisely what we lack
on Capitol Hill.

658
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:25,679
I must be going.

659
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:29,073
-This visit has been most enlightening.
-Yes, it has.

660
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:34,230
PRESlDENT: And Ben, thank you
for your time and thought.

661
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:35,719
Oh, nonsense.

662
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:38,839
Thank you for taking time out
with a dying man.

663
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:40,751
PRESlDENT: No, I won't have any of that.

664
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:43,913
Why don't you listen
to your friend Chauncey?

665
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,230
This is a time to think of life.

666
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:51,232
That's right, Mr. President.

667
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:54,798
PRESlDENT: Now, you take care, Ben.

668
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:57,677
RAND: And you take care, too, Bobby.

669
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:02,915
Chauncey.

670
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:04,789
Bobby.

671
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:23,994
He's a decent fellow, isn't he,
the President?

672
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:27,669
Yes. I'm glad he came.

673
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:34,876
Kaufman, I'll need some information
on Chauncey Gardiner's background.

674
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:37,838
-Gardiner, yes, sir.
-And I'd like it sometime today.

675
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:39,473
No problem, chief.

676
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:50,030
