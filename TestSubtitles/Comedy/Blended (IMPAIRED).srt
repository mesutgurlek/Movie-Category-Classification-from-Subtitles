00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:04,202
Are you allowed to do that
with anyone else?

466
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:07,004
Am I allowed?

467
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:11,342
Your mother,
before she left...

468
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:14,011
That's all
she would talk about

469
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:16,347
was me
finding somebody else.

470
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:19,517
But I would tell her
I can't

471
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:22,353
because
she's my one and only.

472
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:25,523
What did mommy say?

473
00:20:25,525 --> 00:20:30,328
Your mom would say
my heart is so big

474
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,763
that it has room for two.

475
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:36,767
That's another thing I miss
about your mother.

476
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:40,304
She actually thought
I was awesome.

477
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:43,674
I think
you're awesome, daddy.

478
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:48,112
Thank you.

479
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:49,714
Hey, dad?

480
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:52,149
Um, I-I have
a personal errand to run,

481
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:53,851
and I need
to borrow the car.

482
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:55,786
Well, you can't drive
without me yet,

483
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:58,322
and somebody's got to stay here
with your sisters.

484
00:20:58,324 --> 00:21:01,592
Dad,
I have a personal errand.

485
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,127

486
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:05,229
Eh, you taking a hit out
on somebody?

487
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:08,065
Dad, she's monsterating.

488
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:09,267
What?

489
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:12,470

492
00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:20,411

500

Wow.
What a progressive mother.

514
00:22:29,282 --> 00:22:34,985
No, I-I found a centerfold
under his bed, and I tore it up.

515
00:22:34,987 --> 00:22:38,456
From a magazine,
not the Internet?

516
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:40,358
He's old school.
I respect that.

517
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,692
Why'd you tear it up?

518
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:44,462
Because as a woman,
I was totally offended.

519

You don't have to be.

520

It's a normal part
of growin' up.

521
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:54,572
Okay, but he taped a picture
of our babysitter's face on it.

522
00:22:54,574 --> 00:22:56,507
Okay. That's sick.
He needs help.

I'm sorry to report that.
Oh, very funny.

525
00:23:00,313 --> 00:23:01,846
Okay, but if you had kids,
you'd understand it's...

526
00:23:01,848 --> 00:23:04,482
Three daughters.
...Complicated.

527
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:06,617
You have three daughters?
Yes.

528
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:10,287
Do you have any other children,
or just the masturbator?

529
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:12,690
He has a younger brother.
Uh-huh.

530
00:23:12,692 --> 00:23:14,625
Well, maybe you'll do
a better job with that kid.

531
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:16,827
I'm just jokin'.

00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:18,195
So, what?
You're here to replace it

before the kid finds out?

534
00:23:19,632 --> 00:23:23,033
Yes. But I can't tell
what magazine it's from.

Yes, I do.

Did a great job.
You can hardly tell.

540
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,455
Snapper magazine.

How can you tell?

542
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,024
From the staple placement

the paper feels,

Yep, that's the one.
Great.

547
00:23:58,137 --> 00:24:00,037
Excuse me. Actually,
I thought of something

548
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:01,105
that might help us both,

549
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:03,607
um, to save us
some embarrassment.

550
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:06,377
How about I bring that up
to the cashier

551
00:24:06,379 --> 00:24:08,479
and you bring this up
for me?

552
00:24:08,481 --> 00:24:11,282
Whoa. Are these
for your daughter?

00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:12,550

and her "friend"
just paid a visit.

555
00:24:15,254 --> 00:24:20,057
Okay. Well, these are
for a much older "friend."

556
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:21,792
A much heavier "friend"

557
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:26,263
staying in a much bigger "room"
than your daughter has.

558
00:24:26,265 --> 00:24:27,665
You lost me.

559
00:24:27,667 --> 00:24:30,134
You found me.
Oh.

560
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:31,368

00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,370
No.

Dick takes a lot
of special-needs people
