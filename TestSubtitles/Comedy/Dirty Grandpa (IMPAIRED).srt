- Give me a minute...
- (WOMAN MOANING)

156
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:21,515
Oh, God! Shit!

157
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:23,870
WOMAN: (ON TV)
Grab my ass!

158
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,553
- You ready to hit the road?
- I'm really sorry, Grandpa.

159
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:31,393
(STAMMERING)
I didn't think you'd be doing that.

160
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,436
Ah, so you caught me
taking a number three.

161
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,350
- Big deal, right?
- Number three?

162
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,828
Have a drink.

163
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:40,912
Uh... No. I'm driving, so...

164
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,075
I just got to finish up my exercises,
and then we'll hop on 16 to 95.

165
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:51,509
Dad says we should take 75 to 95.
It's more direct.

166
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,158
Dad's full of shit.

167
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,799
Grandpa, are you sure you're okay?

168
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:59,239
Thanks for doing this, by the way.

169
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,278
Those fuckheads down at the DMV
took my goddamn license away

170
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,759
because of these fucking
cataracts in my eye.

171
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,558
But I can still hit the shit
out of a golf ball, that's for sure!

172
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:09,836
I made a tee time for us in Florida
for this afternoon.

173
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,035
You can use your
grandmother's lady clubs,

174
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,472
they're right there
by the front door.

175
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:16,028
Okay.

176
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,711
All right, you ready?

177
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:19,437
I thought the plan was
to have breakfast here?

178
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,591
That's your breakfast. Now let's go get
in that giant labia you drove up in

179
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:24,750
and get the fuck out of here.

180
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,952
You sure I should be
driving with this, Grandpa?

181
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:40,836
Don't worry, if you spill it,

182
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:43,000
this giant tampon we're driving
in should soak it up.

183
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,990
Just finishing a work email

184
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,993
for the Steinhart file...

185
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:01,754
So you're a lawyer at your dad's
firm now, is that right?

186
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,195
That's right, and Meredith is too.

187
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:06,475
You know, her dad is one of
the managing partners there, so...

188
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,754
- I know, that's...
- Yeah.

189
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,274
It couldn't have worked out better.

190
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,509
Because it's just that I remember
when you were in high school,

191
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,193
you told me how much you wanted to be
a photographer, travel the world.

192
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:17,394
That sort of thing.

193
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,630
You remember when I got you that
subscription to Time magazine?

194
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:24,798
Yeah, I used to be
into photography, but, um...

195
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:26,950
I mean, with Dad
being at the firm, pfft,

196
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:30,236
it just made so much more sense
to focus on a college curriculum

197
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,720
that stressed the law school track.

198
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:33,392
I mean, I love what I do, Grandpa.

199
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,671
Being a corporate lawyer is awesome,
I get to handle SEC compliance...

200
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:39,115
- No shit!
- Yeah. Yeah.

201
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,509
You handle SEC compliance?

202
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,672
- LP agreements.
- Oh, man, I didn't know that.

203
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:46,557
- LLC agreements.
- You're shitting me!

204
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,995
Being a corporate lawyer,
it's got its upsides.

205
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,587
- You know what I'd rather do?
- What?

206
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:55,352
I'd rather let Queen Latifah
shit in my mouth

207
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,874
from a fucking hot air balloon.

208
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,712
That's me. I'm gonna hit
the liquor store over there,

209
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,513
get some more of the creature. Meet you
back at the Dildomobile in five.

210
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,875
You're paying the check,
Alan Douche-owitz.

211
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,711
(DOOR OPENS)

212
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:11,951
Where do I know that guy from?
He looks so familiar.

213
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:14,349
He looks like
Abercrombie fucked Fitch.

214
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,549
Mmm, yeah, while J.Crew J'd-off.

215
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,028
Shit! No, you guys, he was...
It's so funny.

216
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,350
He was my lab partner
in photography class, freshman year.

217
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,557
No shit!
He's a Florida alum?

218
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,231
Lenore, you can totally
finish the trifecta.

219
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,913
Oh, my God, I already
have alum, remember?

220
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,559
I fucked that crying divorced guy, Tony.

221
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,312
- With the big balls.
- Right. Yeah.

222
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,548
- In the porta-potty.
- Yeah.

223
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:36,913
- At the tailgate.
- Yeah.

224
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I need a professor.

225
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,115
Wait, I'm sorry.
What's the trifecta again?

226
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,918
It's this thing I read about

227
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,072
where in my senior year
I have to fuck a freshman,

228
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,354
an alumni, and a professor.

229
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,395
- Where did you read that?
- In my diary.

230
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,118
Hmm.

231
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,758
- Where I wrote it...
- Yeah.

232
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,513
He used to take
the most beautiful portraits

233
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,476
without using any filters
or Photoshop...

234
00:13:57,559 --> 00:14:00,437
- LENORE: I've read your diary.
- SHADIA: He was amazing.

235
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:01,554
BRADLEY: Oh, my God, you did?

236
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:02,754
- Yeah.
- BRADLEY: Did you like it?

237
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,433
You guys aren't listening.
I'm gonna go say hi to him. Okay?

238
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,475
- Slut...
- Cool...

239
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:10,836
I hope you don't get
Tommy Hilfingered.

240
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:13,433
That was really late,
but it still counts.

241
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,475
Just like all my periods...

242
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:16,559
- Ew.
- What?

243
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,833
Hi. How are you?

244
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:25,639
Good. Here you go,
you can keep the change.

245
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:28,354
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm not... You...

246
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,432
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

247
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:36,749
Um...

248
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,798
- Guys? Guys, listen to me.
- What?

249
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,437
- Let's go.
- Bitch, what?

250
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,192
- Shut the fuck up! Go!
- Oh, my God!

251
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,033
- You all set?
- (DOOR OPENS)

252
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,634
Yeah, I just gave my money
to the other waitress, sorry.

253
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,789
There is no other waitress.

254
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:56,713
I'm the only one who's
ever worked here. Ever...

255
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:59,313
Shit! The fucking piece
of shit car never starts!

256
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,914
Hey!

257
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,629
God, he's like a Mitt Romney Terminator.

258
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,232
Excuse me!

259
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,995
Uh, sorry, my shift is actually over,
so... Sorry...

260
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,514
- Oh, no way.
- What?

261
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,471
- I know you.
- No.

262
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,397
Yeah, I do. You were
in my photography class.

263
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:20,953
You took all those landscapes. Right?

264
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:24,749
- Shadia.
- Yeah. Shadia.

265
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,149
Holy shit, you're Shadia?

266
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,871
- Yeah. Shadia.
- Shadia.

267
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,315
- Jamba!
- (EXCLAIMS) What the fuck!

268
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:33,994
Shadia. It means
"singer" in Arabic.

269
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,429
Or in ancient Arabic,
"al-munshida alati tunadi lel-mei."

270
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,158
Or, "she whose name
calls others to water."

271
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,548
- That's actually right.
- Uh, Shadia, this is my...

272
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,153
Dr. Richards. I teach history
at the University of Georgia.

273
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,037
You're a professor?

274
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,269
Yeah. Why? You looking
for some extra credit?

275
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,470
Jason and I are doing
a story on the Middle East.

276
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:54,471
He's a photographer
for Time magazine.

277
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:58,552
You know, I lost my virginity
at my pop-pop's bingo night.

278
00:15:58,639 --> 00:15:59,709
My name's Lenore.

279
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:04,793
Ah! "The rare and radiant maiden
whom the angels named Lenore"

280
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:06,471
Quoth the Raven, 'Nevermore'"

281
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:12,394
- Diplomaticos, huh?
- Hey, you know your cigars.

282
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,960
What are you,
half Cuban or something?

283
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,792
Actually, I am, professor.

284
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,991
- The bottom half.
- Okay.

285
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,068
SHADIA:
Okay, yeah, we're heading out.

286
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:23,229
- Yeah.
- Good to see you.

287
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,389
We're going
to Daytona Beach for the week.

288
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,913
Oh, my God, and we should have been
there three fucking hours ago...

289
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,990
- (SNAPPING FINGERS)
- ...so let's go, bitches!

290
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,990
- Holy shit.
- What?

291
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,548
Nothing. You're just really gay.

292
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:37,154
Oh, am I?
Thanks, Captain Gaydar.

293
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,595
Jesus! You know,
I'm also black, right?

294
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,591
Yeah, I know. That's funny too.

295
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:44,034
So you guys wanna tag
along for a bit maybe?

296
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,793
Party some babies into us?

297
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:48,073
- Absolutely not!
- Absolutely not!

298
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:51,152
- Why?
- We have a very important tee time.

299
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,349
Of course you do.

300
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,192
And do you also have to take a nap
before you play Mahjong?

301
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:55,918
- No, it's shuffleboard.
- Shuffleboard.

302
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,955
And then early dinner at 4:00.

303
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:59,315
We have a long-standing bet.
Who's the better golfer.

304
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:01,436
Obviously I've got the bigger 3-wood...

305
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,557
Good. Maybe you can use it
to hit your balls right into my vagina.

306
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,436
- Holy shit!

- Okay... Well, I really want them

459
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,279
to post our wedding announcement

460
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:53,432
on the New York Times website
before our rehearsal brunch Friday,

461
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:55,317
so I just wanted to run
your section back to you.

462
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,435
Yeah, you know,
now's really not a good time...

463
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:00,272
Jason? Can we just do this please?

464
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:02,669
(MIMICKING)
"Can we do this now?"

465
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:07,880
- "Jason Richard Kelly, son of..."
- Doctor Smegma Von BoxMunchers."

466
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:12,875
"David and Brooke, is a junior associate
at the law firm of..."

467
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,713
- "Cream pie fart and donkey punch!"
- Okay, who is that?

468
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:20,190
It's no one. It's a waiter
with pretty bad Tourette's, I think...

469
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:21,554
(HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING)

470
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,393
He just keeps walking by yelling
weird shit, I don't know why...

471
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,074
MEREDITH: Okay, well,
what restaurant are you at?

472
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,390
- I can barely even hear you now.
- We're at Chuck E. Cheese's...

473
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,517
(GRUNTING)
Daytona fucking Beach!

474
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:35,511
Daytona fucking Beach!
You're right, buddy!

475
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:38,193
- You're in Daytona Beach?
- Uh...

476
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:40,474
Listen, we're just driving
through Daytona Beach.

477
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,436
- We're en route to Grandpa's...
- Jason!

478
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:43,873
I don't know why you're there,

479
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,719
but you'd better call me
from your grandfather's house

480
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,233
- when you get there tonight, okay?
- Of course, baby.

481
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:51,116
- (LINE DISCONNECTS)
- I love you so much...

482
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,191
- Fuck!
- Marriage is hard.

483
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:54,679
What'd the hot
college girls text back?

484
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:56,750
- (CELL PHONE CHIMES)
- Grandpa, what are you texting them?

485
00:24:56,839 --> 00:24:58,067
- I just texted them.
- What are you texting them?

486
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,912
"We'll meet you on the beach."

487
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,515
Yeah, and I added the emoji
with the wink and the tongue out.

488
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,635
JASON:
I'm not kidding, Grandpa.

489
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,358
You realize that if I don't call her
from your house in Boca tonight,

490
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,952
I'm fucked, man, I'm fucked.

491
00:25:10,039 --> 00:25:13,270
Jesus. Sounds like you're marrying
your fucking parole officer.

492
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:15,827
It's just Meredith.
It's the way she is, man.

493
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:20,198
She just gets, like, anxious when
she doesn't know exactly where I am.

494
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:22,474
Don't panic.
It's organic.

495
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,596
Yeah, I know. Couples get in
fights all the time.

496
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,114
But it's different with Meredith.
She takes it to another level, man,

497
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,588
and I'm telling you, if I don't call her
from your house in Boca, I'm screwed.

498
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,910
Well, ain't nobody got time for that.

499
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,355
Yeah, I know. Clearly.

500
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,953
Which is why I don't understand
how we got so far off schedule.

501
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,473
Oh... Sometimes
life is just a fart zone,

502
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:41,271
and you enter at your own risk.

503
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,032
Have you been reading shit off the shot
glasses and the shirts in here

504
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:47,951
and just saying it like it's wisdom?

505
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:49,632
I was seriously trying
to talk to you, man.

506
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,232
Do you realize the stakes here?

507
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:53,351
- You're ridiculous!
- Smile.

508
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,000
You've had a phone
this entire fucking time?

509
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:57,512
What else
don't I know about you?

510
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:59,635
How the hell do you know
how to speak Arabic?

511
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,471
Dad's never said
anything about that.

512
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,630
That's because your dad
doesn't really know much about me.

513
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,839
I was away with the army
during most of his childhood.

514
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:10,112
- So we were never that close.
- Is that why he doesn't like you?

515
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,398
Anybody work here?

516
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,435
Okay, everybody on the fucking floor!

517
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:22,434
This is a goddamn robbery!
On the fucking ground!

Oh, my God,
you should see your faces!

520
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:29,989
I just went out to grab lunch
and a new horse mask.

521
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:32,877
I left mine at the beach
the other day. Whoo!

522
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,712
I thought you were gonna
shit your pants, little guy.

523
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:39,474
- Gun's real though.
- What the fuck, man!

524
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:41,868
Relax, this is Florida.

525
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,915
Everything's a licensed gun range.

526
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:46,030
You just shot through a wall, man!

527
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:47,552
- Hey...
- There's pedestrians outside!

528
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,598
Yeah, again, it's Florida!
These people don't matter.

529
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:55,229
- What?
- So? Welcome to Tam Pam Surf Slam.

530
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:57,355
What can I do for you gentlemen?
I'm Pam.

531
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,395
- You're Pam?
- Yeah. It's a nickname.

532
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,117
Real name's Pamela.

533
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:06,192
Hey, no, guys! Absolutely not!

534
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:12,195
I will not ever sell you drugs
out of this establishment!

535
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:13,759
We didn't ask you
to sell us drugs.

536
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:15,553
Okay, cool. You're not cops.

537
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:20,269
In which case, welcome to drugs!

538
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:22,270
- Oh, my God.
- Now, I'm pretty cool,

539
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:24,395
so I only sell the stuff
that occurs naturally.

540
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,913
So I got weed,
I got mushrooms, I got meth.

541
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,393
- Meth?
- Yeah.

542
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,480
How is that natural?

543
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:31,750
Well, it occurs naturally
in my cousin's basement in Baltimore,

544
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:34,229
if you know what I mean.
(LAUGHS)

545
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:39,075
Okay, fine, drugs aren't your thing.
Got it. Message received.

546
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:43,199
In which case, listen, we got a great
local charity here. Pam's Kids.

547
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:45,794
- What's Pam's Kids?
- It's my kids.

548
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,950
I got four kids by six different women.

549
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:50,030
I know, the numbers don't add up.

550
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:52,759
Most of 'em are pretty
developmentally disabled.

551

One of 'em you gotta push around
in a weird chair.

552
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:59,113
Heyo! Now that is the generosity
of the human spirit,

553
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,998
and I appreciate that. Some of this
money's gonna feed my kids,

554
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:04,355
some of it's gonna get me a blowjob
by a toothless whore

behind a Dumpster
down at the McDonald's.

Yup! Immediately offensive.

the lighting optimizer on?

- No...
- What?

You did it. You turned
into one of those people.

If you can't think of anything,
lean into them looks, dawg.

762
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:46,990
Can I touch buzzy bee?

763
00:39:47,079 --> 00:39:48,637
I've loved her for...
No, you can't touch buzzy bee!

764
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:52,793
Um... I love the way that she, um...

765
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,474
What are you doing? Stop it!
Go away!

766
00:39:56,559 --> 00:39:58,630
You're getting me in...
Fuck, go away!

767
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:00,358
- BOY: Your buzzy bee looks so fluffy!
- What did he say?

768
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,637
- I just don't know where to start.
- CHILD: Let me touch buzzy bee!

769
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:05,311
- You can't have the bee!
- What?

770
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,992
I want to stroke the bee!

771
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:08,599
JASON: You can't
stroke the bee! Okay?

772
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,710
- BOY: I want to kiss buzzy bee!
- JASON: You can't kiss the bee!

773
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,313
I love the way that she kisses.

774
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,469
- Ow! Kid!
- MAN: Hey!

775
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:17,157
- JASON: Oh, my God...
- MAN: Hey!

776
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:18,195
- Fucking pervert!
- Oh, no.

777
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,840
I got to go right now.
I'm sorry. I love you. Bye!

778
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,831
No, no, no! Jason! Jason!

779
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,228
Come on. I told you to stay with us.

780
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,398
- He let me stroke it.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

781
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,311
Hold on! He's talking
about a pee... A bee.

782
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,516
- A little stuffed bee.
- What bee?

783
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:35,827
There was a bee here, man!

784
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,514
It was so soft.
He let me kiss it.

785
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:40,750
No, I did not let you kiss it!
What are you talking about?

786
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,719
- He did not even... Ahh!
- You're fucking dead!

787
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,677
Dad, that was cool!

788
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:48,434
- (SIRENS WAILING)
- Oh, shit!

789
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:15,038
Could I have some pants?
Please...

790
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:19,398
Oh, Jesus Christ,
I'm so sorry. Of course.

791
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:22,710
Yeah, absolutely.

792
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,315
You want khakis or sweatpants?

793
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,436
- Khakis, please.
- What brand? You like Dockers?

794
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:32,273
- Yeah.
- Yeah, okay. All right.

795
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:36,432
You're like a 30...

796
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:38,237
Yeah, 30 is fine.

797
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,550
What I wouldn't give
to fit in a 30.

798
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:44,838
Maybe 20 years ago, you know?
When I was seven years old.

799
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,514
Yeah... all right.

800
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:49,750
Also I'm gonna step out
and get some lunch.

801
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,909
Do you want a sandwich?

802
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,672
I would love a sandwich.

803
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,193
- Ham? Turkey?
- Turkey?

804
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,476
Turkey. That's so funny,
because I'm a turkey guy myself.

805
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:01,869
- You know.
- Thank you so much.

806
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,677
Okay, absolutely.
You want mayo on that?

807
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,512
- Uh, no thank you, no.
- Okay.

808
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:07,590
- Extra veggies.
- Extra veggies?

809
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:09,590
- Yes, please.
- You got it. Absolutely.

810
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:10,760
- And...
- Salt and vinegar.

811
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,552
- You want salt and vinegar as well?
- Yeah, thank you.

812
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:15,630
You gotta watch that sodium.

813
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,400
That's what drives your
blood pressure up,

814
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,237
and blood pressure is a silent killer.

815
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:22,436
All right, turkey, okay... all right.

816
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:24,914
Yeah. And, uh, finally,

817
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,231
do you want to be sodomized by a man
with the mental age of seven

818
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,878
who calls himself Ping-Pong,

819
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,952
or do you want to be shivved by,
uh, the same guy?

820
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:39,556
Just let me know what time works for
you, 'cause you're in fucking jail.

821
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:44,038
(TOILET FLUSHING)

822
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:47,351
All right. Gary,
I'm all done. It's late.

823
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,876
- I gotta go open the store, buddy.
- I know, but you tried to sell peyote

824
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:55,317
- to middle schoolers.
- What? Come on. It's me. Pam!

825
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:59,278
Don't be a dick. Come on!
I just had watery diarrhea,

826
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,920
I want to get out of here.
It stinks.

827
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,309
It does stink.

828
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,992
All right,
let's get you out of there.

829
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:10,039
All right! Whoo!
I don't like being in a cage.

830
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:12,554
You're letting him out?
He's the one that sold drugs.

831
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:15,358
- Why are you letting him out?
- Hey, man! Not cool!

832
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,556
That's a real dick move,
throwing me under the bus.

833
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:18,992
What the fuck are you talking about?

834
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:20,831
You're the one that sold drugs
last night!

835
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:24,594
- Hey, guy, snitches get stitches!
- All right.

836
00:43:24,679 --> 00:43:26,556
So why don't you shut
your fucking mouth, bro.

837
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:30,474
Yeah. Snitches get stitches,
my friend.

838
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:33,074
My name's Pam. (LAUGHS)

839
00:43:33,159 --> 00:43:35,434
- All right.
- You're incorrigible.

840
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:38,353
- Hey, how are you, Finch?
- How you doing? Good to see you.

841
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:41,000
- Finchy! Finch!
- Hey! You got it.

842
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:43,159
Must beautiful woman
on the police force, right here.

843
00:43:43,239 --> 00:43:45,992
- Jeez!
- The only woman, but...

844
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:47,307
- Here's the deal.
- What's up?

845
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,755
I came in here with a bag of drugs,
I'm not gonna lie to you.

846
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:53,559
I can't leave without it.

847
00:43:53,639 --> 00:43:55,550
- Can you guys hook me up there?
- Yep...

848
00:43:55,639 --> 00:43:57,436
- Ooh! Gary!
- These yours?

849
00:43:57,519 --> 00:44:00,239
- Yeah. Thanks, Gare-Bear.
- Oh! Nice catch.

850
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:03,311
PAM: Hey, right? Please remember,
next Tuesday is the election.

851
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,550
Vote for me for mayor.
I'm gonna win this year.

852
00:44:05,639 --> 00:44:07,755
- I'm gonna beat that goat.
- You got my vote.

853
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:11,548
- (LAUGHS)
- Pam! Pam!

854
00:44:11,639 --> 00:44:14,632
- FINCH: He is just a good one.
- He is just a number one...

855
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:17,677
- Lover and a fighter.
- Okay, listen.

856
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:21,918
Guys, I really respect
the job you guys do.

857
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,239
I'm being completely honest,
from the bottom of my heart,

858
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:27,192
I look up to you.
I fight for the law.

859
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,394
Thank you, no one ever
says that to us.

860
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,038
- Ever.
- That's what I wanted to do

861
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:31,235
when I was a kid.

862
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,911
Like, I wanted to do
what you guys do.

863
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,708
Mostly people just call us pigs
and throw bags of fast food at us.

864
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,755
- Yeah.
- I'm incredibly sorry

865
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:40,318
for all this confusion,
but listen to me, please.

866
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,277
I have to let you know,
I am a lawyer.

867
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:47,114
- Whoa! You're a lawyer?
- I am, yeah. I'm actually a lawyer.

868
00:44:47,199 --> 00:44:49,793
Whoa!
You don't look like a lawyer.

869
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:52,268
Yeah. Yeah, I handle, like, uh,
corporate stuff.

870
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:56,239
Like, uh... like LLC agreements,

871
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,309
- LP agreements...
- You lost me.

872
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,436
- I don't even know what that means.
- I mean, like, you...

873
00:45:00,519 --> 00:45:02,077
- ...you don't look Jewish.
- No.

874
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:04,594
- Which is weird.
- It's actually pretty funny.

875
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:07,518
- (LAUGHING)
- There you go...

876
00:45:07,639 --> 00:45:11,110
That is funny!
It is so weird!

877
00:45:11,199 --> 00:45:12,791
- It's darkly ironic.
- It really is.

878
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,110
Yes, exactly. Dark irony.

879
00:45:15,199 --> 00:45:18,556
I thought you had to be, like,
at least 80 to be a lawyer.

880
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:21,028
- Like, it's a lot of school, right?
- Yeah.

881
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,588
It's... it's, uh...
it's a lot of school.

882
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:27,434
The bar...
something I took and passed.

883
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:29,909
It's not something
I stand behind.

884
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:34,079
- (CHUCKLES)
- Yeah. I'm not on this side, typically,

885
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:37,469
and I just, uh, I just...
I know my rights,

886
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:38,800
and I would love my phone call.

887
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,148
- Objection.
- Overruled.

888
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:42,913
- Permission to approach the bench?
- Denied!

889
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,672
- What?
- It's easy to be a lawyer.

890
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,876
- It's so easy.
- I would love my phone call.

891
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,509
- (MIMICKING)
- Okay. I know my rights.

892
00:45:52,599 --> 00:45:54,954
- I want my phone call.
- (BABBLING) Give me my phone call!

893
00:45:55,039 --> 00:45:57,713
- I should have a phone call!
- This is my First Amendment right.

894
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,996
(MIMICKING) My first, page one,
number one amendment

895
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:03,355
- says that I have a telephone!
- I get a phone call.

896
00:46:03,559 --> 00:46:06,597
- This is my First Amendment right.
- I'm guaranteed a phone call.

897
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,869
- I don't sound like that.
- (MIMICKING) Yeah?

898
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,996
- What do you sound like then?
- Not like that.

899
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:15,476
- I don't even sound like that.
- (MIMICKING, BABBLING)

900
00:46:15,559 --> 00:46:18,074
- Give me my phone call.
- (MIMICKING) Oh, please, let me

901
00:46:18,159 --> 00:46:19,911
- have my phone call.
- (MOANING)

902
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,514
I'm an American
and I'm fucking guaranteed...

903
00:46:22,599 --> 00:46:24,396
- (MIMICKING)
- I am an American...

904
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,356
- (MIMICKING)
- I am guaranteed a phone call.

905
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:29,909
(STRAINED VOICE) My right to have
a phone call!

906
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,114
I just said I'm an American,
and I'm guaranteed a phone call.

907
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:37,474
- Hm. Well, now he's getting demanding.
- Yeah.

908
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:40,153
- We better give him his phone call.
- Better give him his phone call.

909
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:44,027
Guys, come on. Come on, please.
(STAMMERS) Why are we doing this?

910
00:46:44,119 --> 00:46:45,871
This is your phone right here, right?

911
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:49,032
- That is my phone, yes.
- Well, you know what?

912
00:46:49,159 --> 00:46:52,038
We get to make one phone call
on your phone.

913
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:53,672
That's where you're a little bit
mixed up.

914
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,556
Yeah, hopefully, you're not
out of "framily" minutes.

915
00:46:55,639 --> 00:46:57,869
- No, no, no.
- Get a free Uber ride on that.

916
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,398
- Go ahead.
- Take us out to lunch.

917
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:02,916
You know what? We're gonna be kind
and set you up with a Tinder account.

918
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,309
- How about Grindr? What about, uh...
- Look at this!

919
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,630
- Jefe, is that how you pronounce that?
- Yeah, how about Jefe.

920
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,068
Yeah, huh? A little alone time
with Jefe?

921
00:47:10,159 --> 00:47:13,675
He'd like some light conversation
and heavy petting,

922
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,431
- flirting, flirtations.
- He looks thick and lonely.

923
00:47:15,559 --> 00:47:18,835
FINCH: You will meet him at
eight. You'll bring wine coolers.

924
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:24,552
- And... children's condoms.
- (LAUGHS)

925
00:47:24,639 --> 00:47:27,393
- Just gonna take a little picture.
- Snatch-chat.

926
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:29,356
- Yeah, a little Snatch-chat.
- Please don't do that with my phone.

927
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,713
Hope you got a wide-angle lens on that.

928
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,597
- Oh! Wow.

Get that pervert some pants.

931
00:47:41,639 --> 00:47:43,277
FINCH: All right.

932
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,112
These were
a couple pair of pants

933
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:49,556
from murder victims
from a 1990s orgy gone bad.

934
00:47:49,639 --> 00:47:53,349
We got semen-stained
or blood-stained.

935
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,034
Take your pick.
What's it gonna be?

936
00:47:57,159 --> 00:47:59,355
- Blood.
- Semen it is.

937
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,632
- Hey, there he is.
- No.

938
00:48:04,719 --> 00:48:06,311
Don't even fucking talk to me.

939
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:11,076
I know things got a little chaotic,
but I'm so close with Lenore...

940
00:48:11,199 --> 00:48:12,838
What the fuck is wrong with you?

941
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:15,228
I'm about to get fucking
married, Grandpa!

942
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:19,153
In one week! To a Jewish girl!
And I just woke up in fucking jail

943
00:48:19,239 --> 00:48:24,791
with a bunch of penises on my forehead
in the shape of a swastika!

944
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:27,275
Could call it a swasticock.

945
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,476
- What?
- It's a play on words.

946
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:32,072
Oh, it's a play on words.

947
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,231

948
00:48:36,519 --> 00:48:37,952
Play on these words.

949
00:48:38,039 --> 00:48:41,793
I'm dropping you off
at your old army vet buddy's house,

950
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,677
he's gonna drive you to fucking Boca.

951
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,876
Because I'm fucking
done with you.

952
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:52,590
- What the fuck are you looking at?
- I can't help staring at your tits.

00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:56,547
- Pow!
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

954
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:03,349
You know, Stinky
had more confirmed kills

955
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:07,353
than anyone in our platoon
back in 'Nam? 118.

956
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:08,509
Shut the fuck up.

957
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,952
- What is this place?
- I don't know. Or care.

958
00:49:14,039 --> 00:49:15,239
At least just come in with me.

959
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,197
Let's make sure
it's the right house.

960
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,110

Your grandmother's
ashes are in there.

She's in a coffin. Fuck you!

Oh, well,

Yeah! Fuck them up, ALF!

Stinky?

968
00:49:40,599 --> 00:49:43,478
What the fuck
are you doing here, Dick?

969
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,471
Oh, this?

970
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:49,119
This is liver failure.

971
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:55,070
- Who's the lesbian?
- That's my grandson, Jason.

972
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:59,152
Yeah? Is he here to scissor with me?

973
00:49:59,239 --> 00:50:00,911
Okay, that's just
offensive to lesbians.

974
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,389
I am very sorry, K.D. Lang.

Come on. Stinky, we got to get
you the fuck out of here.

977
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,675
- Come on, let's go.
- I have one fucking month left, Dick!

978
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,637
I don't want you
to remember me like this, man.

979
00:50:15,719 --> 00:50:18,438
I want you
to remember me as a warrior.

980
00:50:18,519 --> 00:50:21,431
- Please. Leave me be.
- But, Stinky...

981
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:23,590
No, no, no...
Just let me finish, Dick.

982
00:50:23,679 --> 00:50:29,436
Leave me your beautiful lesbian grandson
so he can blowjob me to death.

983
00:50:33,039 --> 00:50:35,873
It's all over for me, Dick.

984

So it comes to this.

990
00:51:04,199 --> 00:51:07,556
Even before you die,
you just stop living,

991

and it's all one fucked-up
facsimile of the real thing.

- I'll drive us home.
- Not Atlanta. Daytona.

- What?
- I have to fuck that girl, Jason.

996
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:32,193
- Jesus, Grandpa!
- I do. I have to fuck her.

997
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:35,077
Grandpa, you're just depressed.

998
00:51:35,159 --> 00:51:37,150
You're confused right now
because of Grandma.

999
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,429
Grandma wanted me to do this.

1000
00:51:39,519 --> 00:51:41,670
- What?
- Yeah. She said when she died,

1001
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,637
she wanted me to move on
and live my life the way I wanted to,

1002
00:51:44,719 --> 00:51:46,199
and right now,
you know what I want to do?

1003
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:48,474
I want to get my dick sucked
by that fucking college girl!

1004
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:50,516
What is that going to do for you?

1005
00:51:50,599 --> 00:51:52,280
Is that going to make
you feel young again?

1006
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:55,112
- Yeah! Yeah, what's wrong with that?
- Yeah?

1007
00:51:55,199 --> 00:51:57,554
Feeling young again?
What do I have?

1008
00:51:57,639 --> 00:51:59,471
A dead wife, dying friends.

1009
00:51:59,559 --> 00:52:01,710
A few fucking good
years left if I'm lucky.

1010
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:05,509
And you know what?
It fucking freaks me out!

00:52:05,639 --> 00:52:07,197
Yeah.

1012

Look, I don't expect
you to understand. You're young.

You have a long, long time before
you have to look into that abyss.

1014

But the way I see it, having sex
with that girl is my last stand.

1015
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:22,034
And I can't do it without you.

1016
00:52:22,119 --> 00:52:28,434
So I'm asking you. Please, Jason, just
stay one more day so I can do this.

you doing this

The greatest gift a grandson
can give his grandfather

- What's the matter?

I think I'm gonna
call off my wedding.

1436
01:15:02,439 --> 01:15:07,514
Well, when you get married,
it's for a long fucking time.

1437
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:09,476
And it's hard.

1438
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:12,949
So it damn well better be with a woman
who keeps things interesting.

1439
01:15:13,039 --> 01:15:17,271
You know your grandmother, she tried to
grow her own pot plant once?

- Really?
- Yeah,

1441
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:21,996
she just wanted to see
if she could do it.

(LAUGHS)

1443
01:15:24,079 --> 01:15:26,594
She was always
surprising me like that.

1444
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:31,909
We also tried anal
once every five years.

1445
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:35,391
Sweet.

1446
01:15:35,479 --> 01:15:39,029
I miss having someone
to share everything with.

1447
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:45,913
It's not fair to just keep Shadia
in the dark like this.

1448
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,230
Since we started this,
it's just been one big lie.

1449
01:15:49,319 --> 01:15:52,153
She has no idea who I am.

1450
01:15:52,239 --> 01:15:54,117
I have to tell her the truth.

1451
01:15:54,199 --> 01:15:58,636
Well, maybe telling her
tonight is a little abrupt.

1452
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:01,792
The most important part
of a relationship is trust.

1453
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:04,632
- That's right.
- And I'm going to start now.

1454
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:08,554
Or you can just wait till
I have sex with Lenore tonight,

1455
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:10,710
then you can tell Shadia everything.

1456
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:15,715
- No. I'm just lying.
- Jason, I'm your grandfather!

1457
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:17,478
You wait till I fuck
that college girl!

1458
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:19,630
- I'm telling her now.
- Jason...

1459
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:23,912
Jason! Jason!

with a name and Google these days.

1464

You're not a real professor?

1465
01:16:41,359 --> 01:16:44,193
Oh, my God!
You lied to us. How could you.

1466
01:16:44,279 --> 01:16:47,238
Wait, wait, wait, this is the best part.
This is the best part.

That is so fucked up.

That is so hot.
I mean, that is so fucked up.

So... are you getting married
next weekend?

1479

I was.
I was getting married,

1480

but then I met you,
and now I don't...

1481

Oh, my God!
No. Don't pull that shit.

(VOICE BREAKING)
I feel fucking stupid enough as it is.

1483
01:17:50,079 --> 01:17:52,957
So you're not a professor?
Are you even a photographer?

1484

- I'm a lawyer.

LLC agreements.
I came up here to...

1487
01:18:03,239 --> 01:18:04,912
Get the fuck out, Jason. Seriously.

1488
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,069
- Can I have a second to explain?
- No!

1489
01:18:07,199 --> 01:18:09,997
Hold up, hold up.
Not so fast, professor.

1490
01:18:12,119 --> 01:18:15,555
For what's it worth,
I still really want to fuck you.

1491
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:17,948
- And we're going to fuck.
- Yeah, we are.

1492
01:18:18,039 --> 01:18:20,712
- We're going to thunder fuck.
- You're gonna tsunami on my face!

01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:23,194
You're gonna flood like the Nile.

1494

Yeah. I guess the drought
in my pussy is finally over.

The villagers will finally eat.

1496
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:29,198
You're gonna die
while you're eating me out.

1497
01:18:29,279 --> 01:18:31,077
I want your last breath
to be in my pussy.

You're such a slut.

- Check the right coat pocket.

- Check it, man.
- Okay, turn around. Come on.

That's not his jacket.

What've you got in here? Huh?

01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:10,157
She's like,
"Go! Do your thing. Do you."

1662
01:28:10,239 --> 01:28:13,198
- She said that?
- NICK: That's what she said, verbatim.

1663
01:28:13,279 --> 01:28:15,110
Wait. Should I come down and say bye?

1664

- No?

Yeah. No need to even...

Jason! Jason!

1669
01:28:37,640 --> 01:28:40,597
It's actually the guy
on the moped with the iPad.

1670
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:44,592
NSA stopped using
utility vans years ago.

1671
01:28:44,680 --> 01:28:46,796
I figured once you sent
the camera back,

1672
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:48,871
it was time to take
drastic measures.

1673
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:50,951
What'd he say?
Are we doing this?

1674
01:28:51,039 --> 01:28:53,314
DICK: Plan B,
have Pam kidnap you.

1675
01:28:53,399 --> 01:28:56,710
- I've got to get her back.
- You want me to kidnap her?

1676
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:58,836
I'll bring her back to you
in a box, bro.

1677
01:28:58,920 --> 01:29:01,832
She's on a bus headed west
on I-85 across Florida.

Her boat leaves in four hours.

1679
01:29:04,159 --> 01:29:06,798
It was easy to track her down because
of the whole Middle Eastern thing.

because of the Patriot Act.

You 69 her, man!

1682
01:29:12,319 --> 01:29:14,037
And then she's dead.

1683

Are you kidding me, Pam?
This is what you drive?

Just leave him on the side of road?

Hey, man, can you slow down?
You're making this very difficult.

all those dicks on me last week?

01:36:05,119 --> 01:36:08,590
And I actually want to see
your photos in Time magazine.

1812
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:11,877
This camera set me back
three months of my army pension!

1813
01:36:25,479 --> 01:36:26,878
Thanks, Grandpa.

1814
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:32,310
- Oh, and, Jason...
- Yeah?

1815
01:36:34,159 --> 01:36:36,275
Back in the '80s,
when Andre the Giant

1816
01:36:36,359 --> 01:36:39,238
used to go to the Playboy Mansion,

1817
01:36:39,319 --> 01:36:42,756
he'd stack five playmates
on top of each other on a bed

1818
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:44,956
and fingerfuck them all.
Five at a time.

1819
01:36:45,039 --> 01:36:46,837
Because his hands were so big.

1820
01:36:49,159 --> 01:36:53,198
So... that's it.

1821
01:36:57,880 --> 01:37:00,439
Thanks, Grandpa.

DICK: "De Oppresso Liber."

1823
01:37:03,880 --> 01:37:05,631
Motto of the Green Berets.

1824
01:37:07,199 --> 01:37:09,030
It means "to liberate the oppressed."

1825
01:37:22,359 --> 01:37:25,033
- Hey. You ready?
- Yep.

1826
01:37:32,399 --> 01:37:35,311
I don't think he's gonna find
anybody as good as me.

1827
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:40,150
I'm sorry, but you know what they say...

1828
01:37:40,239 --> 01:37:43,231
Um... tough times

1829
01:37:43,319 --> 01:37:46,198
can sometimes lead to tougher people.

1830
01:37:46,279 --> 01:37:49,158
- Hm.
- That's Kurt Vonnegut.

1831

Yeah.

1832
01:38:08,359 --> 01:38:10,828
Holy fucking shit!

1833
01:38:12,760 --> 01:38:14,829
Has anyone ever told you
that you have the pussy

1834
01:38:14,920 --> 01:38:16,069
of an English sheepdog?

1835
01:38:27,960 --> 01:38:29,631
Well, thanks for the ride.

1836
01:38:31,960 --> 01:38:33,313
You gonna be okay, Dad?

1837
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:37,238
I miss her.

1838
01:38:39,279 --> 01:38:40,917
But I'll be okay.

1839
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:51,034
- I was a shitty father and I'm sorry.
- Well, we'll work on it.

1840
01:39:07,159 --> 01:39:09,673
You're a hard man
to track down, professor.

1841
01:39:13,319 --> 01:39:16,391
- Are those my pants?
- Yeah, these are your pants.

1842
01:39:16,479 --> 01:39:18,390
I found a Werther's
Original in the pocket

1843
01:39:18,479 --> 01:39:20,310
and I've been
sucking on it all morning.

1844
01:39:20,399 --> 01:39:23,914
You do know that
I'm not a professor, right?

1845
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,114
Yeah, I know.

1846
01:39:25,199 --> 01:39:27,760
You're just a dirty, dirty grandpa,

1847
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:30,912
and I'm just a girl
from Long lsland City

1848
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:32,591
who likes to fuck old people.

1849
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:35,591
I like your pull-out couch.

1850
01:39:35,680 --> 01:39:38,478
Yeah, well, I got news for you.

1851
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:41,836
That's the only thing
that's gonna be pulling out tonight.

1852
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:43,511
I'll be right back.

1853
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:01,958
Oh, hey.

1854
01:40:02,039 --> 01:40:06,636
Look, I'm... I'm sorry.
I don't know if I can do this.

1855
01:40:06,720 --> 01:40:08,118
I haven't done it for a long time.

1856
01:40:27,279 --> 01:40:30,238
Whoops! I guess they just slipped off.

1857
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:34,757
I want you to tear open my bra
like it's a social security check.

1858
01:40:45,479 --> 01:40:47,755
Tell me you've fallen
and you can't get up.

1859
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:50,672
"Help, I've fallen
and I can't get up."

1860
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:51,988
Oh, no!

1861
01:40:53,439 --> 01:40:56,113
Now fumble around and pretend like
you're trying to find your glasses.

1862
01:40:56,199 --> 01:40:58,315
"I'm trying to find my glasses.
I can't see.

I found them! I can see! I can see!"

1864
01:41:03,640 --> 01:41:06,676
Tell me it's 4:00
and you want to eat dinner.

1865
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:08,909
"It's 4:00 and I want to eat dinner."

1866
01:41:09,039 --> 01:41:10,472
Tell me the buttons
on your remote control

1867
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:12,710
are so small
that you can't find Fox News.

1868
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:16,509
"The buttons on my remote control
are so small I can't find Fox News!"

1869
01:41:16,600 --> 01:41:18,875
- Tell me how small they are!
- "They're real small!"

1870
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:20,800
Tell me how this neighborhood
used to be safer!

1871
01:41:20,840 --> 01:41:22,353
"This neighborhood used to be safer!"

1872
01:41:22,439 --> 01:41:24,475
Tell me how things were
better under Eisenhower!

1873
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:26,595
"Things were better under Eisenhower!"

1874
01:41:26,680 --> 01:41:29,512
- We like Ike!
- We like Ike!

1875

You just keep surprising me, Grandpa.

New dad at 72.
Great fucking idea.

Hey, watch your potty mouth!

And sweetie, would it kill
you to visit us sometimes?

- We never see you.
- Sorry, Nanna.

Did you get that card I sent
for your birthday?

- Yeah.
- Mm-hm.

Yeah, with the $12 check?
It was a very nice touch. Thank you.

Thank you, that's right.
Hey, are you gaining some weight?

I know your baby just got baptized.
