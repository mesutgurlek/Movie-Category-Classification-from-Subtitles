from starvation.

159
00:10:30,197 --> 00:10:32,230
Sorry.
That was a little intense.

160
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:35,700
I meant really serious
hunger pains.

161
00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:36,635
Verne!

162
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:39,704
Not finished, Hammy.
Morning, Lou, Penny.

163
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:41,773
- Thanks.
- Hey, kids.

164
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:43,341
- What I want to tell you is...
- Verne!

165
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:46,878
I'm not done, Hammy.
If you have to go again,
just go.

166
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,047
OK. So all I'm saying
is we cut it a little close.

167
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:51,650
So this year we need
to make sure that
we fill the log...

168
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:56,154
- All the way to the top.
- Exactly. All the way
to the top.

169
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,757
- Because what are we?
- Foragers!

170
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:01,760
- And what do we forage?
- Food!

171
00:11:01,762 --> 00:11:04,262
- Right.
- Super, Verne,
really super.

172
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:06,231
- OK, Hammy.
- Huh?

173
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:07,766
- What is it?
- What is what?

174
00:11:07,768 --> 00:11:09,834
What is it you want to tell me?

175
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:10,368
Hmm? Oh. Oh!

176
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,971
What was it, what was it,
what was it, what was it?

177
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:15,173
Wait. Right on the tip
of my tongue. Oh, yeah!

178
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,676
There's a weird thing
I've never seen before.

179
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:21,346
It's really scary.
Follow me.

180
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:25,917
OK. Meeting called on account
of weird scary thing.

181
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:28,186
Let's go.

182
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:31,756
Hmm. Foragers...

183
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,426
Hammy, what weird thing?

184
00:11:34,428 --> 00:11:39,397
Oh. That weird thing.

185
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:50,108
[gulps]

186
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,976
[gasps]

187
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:08,860
It never ends!

188
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,130
Whoa!

189
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:14,232
Hey!

190
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,235
It never ends that way too!

191
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,770
- Jeepers, Lou.
- Whoa.

192
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:20,271
[Lou] Yeah, jeepers
is the word there, hon.

193
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:25,443
- I've never seen
anything like this.
- Man, that's big.

194
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:30,014
- What is this thing?
- Heather, no!

195
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:31,416
- I'm scared.
- Me too, Mama.

196
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:36,221
Shh! It's OK, it's just a...
What is this thing, Lou?

197
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:39,224
I... Well, it's a...
It's... Verne?

198
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:42,494
Well, it's, uh...
it's obviously...

199
00:12:42,496 --> 00:12:43,461
some kind of bush?

200
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:46,531
I'd be less afraid of it
if I knew what it was called.

201
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:48,466
- Let's call it Steve!
- Steve?

202
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:51,035
- It's a pretty name.
- Steve sounds nice.

203
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:52,504
I'm a lot less scared of Steve.

204
00:12:52,506 --> 00:12:54,806
Oh, great and powerful Steve!

205
00:12:54,808 --> 00:12:58,543
- What do you want?
- I don't think
it can speak.

206
00:12:58,545 --> 00:13:00,545
[woman] I heard that,
young man!

207
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:02,247
- [all scream]
- [gasps]

208
00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:04,215
- [woman] You get over here!
- OK.

209
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:05,183
Hammy, get back here.

210
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:08,553
- Steve is angry!
- It came from
the other side of Steve.

211
00:13:08,555 --> 00:13:11,856
I mean the bush.
I mean... Jeez!

212
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:12,557
[sighing]

213
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:16,060
There's only one way
we're gonna find out
what this thing is,

214
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:20,799
and what this is all about.
I'm gonna go check it out.

215
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:23,234
[gulp] Aah!

216
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:26,538
- [all scream]
- Ay yai yai.

217
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:29,274
Uh... Aah!

218
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:30,975
Steve ate Verne!

219
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,845
All right, Steve,
you brought this on yourself.

220
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:39,450
Stella, don't!
I'm not eaten,
I just tripped.

221
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:44,556
I'm gonna go over there.
Just don't anybody move.

222
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:49,928
[shuddering]

223
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:56,968
[woman] Kids, come on,
hurry up! You'll be late!

224
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,470
[car engine starting]

225
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:03,208
[woman] Gary,
come on, breakfast!

226
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:06,845
[dog barking in distance]

227
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:13,218
What is this place?

228
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:25,029
Oh, hey there, little...

229
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,631
- [sizzling]
- Ohh!

230
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:29,234
fella. Ugh!

231
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:33,037
Oh! [gasps]

232
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,307
Hi.

233
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:37,542
Aah!

234
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:41,246
- Oh!
- [rolling]

235
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:43,181
[gasps]

236
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,651
[panting]

237
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:50,255
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

238
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:52,223
Ow.

239
00:14:57,963 --> 00:15:01,633
Whoa! Ohh!

240
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:09,908
- <i>[ringing]</i>
<i>- Operator.</i>
<i>Can I help you?</i>

241
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:14,679
No, I can talk.
I'm just driving.

242
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:23,588
[bicycle bell rings]

243
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:27,058
- [quavering]
- [yelling]

244
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:30,094
Aaah!

245
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:31,629
- [grunting]
- Verne's back.

246
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:33,231
- Verne!
- Jeepers!

247
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:34,632
- You OK?
- Help him up.

248
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:37,468
- What was over there?
- Freaky pink primates!

249
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,538
They must have come while we
were hibernating. It was awful.

250
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,574
They had wheels on their feet
and these sticks, and they were

251
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:46,344
whacking me with
these sticks like it was
some sort of sick game.

252
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:51,282
You should have died!
You should have
laid down and died.

253
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,618
- Dad.
- That's not
the worst part.

254
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,254
Half the forest is gone.

255
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:58,122
The oak trees
and the berry bushes,

256
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:01,159
they're just...
they're just gone.

257
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:05,029
- Jeepers.
- What'll we do for food?

258
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:07,565
How are we gonna live?

259
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,068
I don't know.
But here's what I do know.

260
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:14,138
We will be fine
as long as no one
goes over Steve again.

261
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:19,243
It's called a hedge,
and it is not to be feared,
my amphibious friend.

262
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:23,114
It is the gateway
to the good life.

263
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:24,983
Uh, I'm a reptile, actually.

264
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:27,452
But, you know,
it's a common mistake.

265
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:28,419
And, uh, you are?

266
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:31,990
Oh. Where are my manners.
I'm RJ.

267
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:34,359
Don't think I'm prying,
but I couldn't help
overhearing,

268
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:39,364
and I can shed a little light
on what this whole hedge
situation is about.

269
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:41,199
You see, what was
once mere wilderness

270
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:46,037
is now 54 acres
of man-made, manicured,
air-conditioned paradise.

271
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:49,207
Except for that
little-bitty speck.
You are here.

272
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:53,444
- [gasping]
- No, no, that's a good thing.
You're hibernators, right?

273
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:55,613
You gather up food,
store it for the winter?

274
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:58,016
- Uh-huh. We fill the log!
- Hammy.

275
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:00,752
Really? This log?
This cave-like log?

276
00:17:00,754 --> 00:17:04,288
- All the way to the top.
- Ozzie.

277
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,456
Let me ask ya,
how long's it take?

278
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:09,293
- You know, to fill the log?
- Two hundred and
seventy-four days.

279
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:13,464
- Ohh! Ever done it in a week?
- That's impossible.

280
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:14,399
Not if we work together.

281
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:17,268
You've got
the food gathering skills,
I've got the know-how,

282
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,404
- and they have the food!
- How much food?

283
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:23,441
Loads of food. Heaps of food.
Food out the wazoo!

284
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:26,210
Well, whatever kind of food
comes out of a wazoo,

285
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,112
I don't think
we're interested in eating.

286
00:17:28,114 --> 00:17:29,680
I don't know,
the guy's making
a lot of sense to me.

287
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:33,584
- I think we should listen.
- Yeah, I'm OK with
wazoo food there.

288
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:36,621
No, you're not.
The tail is tingling.

289
00:17:36,623 --> 00:17:40,258
- Why didn't you say so?
- Hold on, hold on.
The what is what?

290
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,561
When something doesn't
feel right, my tail tingles.
Let me tell you,

291
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:45,530
everything you've said so far
is driving my tail crazy.

292
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:50,768
Listen. Verne, right?
This isn't something
you need to be afraid of.

293
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:54,806
Well, I am.
And for good reason.

294
00:17:54,808 --> 00:17:55,740
This is not a birthmark.

295
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:58,676
That's because you went
over there without a guide.

296
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:00,578
Thanks for stopping by.
We're not interested.

297
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:04,816
Not interested in
the most delicious food
you've ever tasted?

298
00:18:04,818 --> 00:18:06,517
- No!
- Come on.

299
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:09,620
Not interested!

300
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:11,456
OK. I get it.

301
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:18,196
I understand.
This is something that
you're just not open to.

302
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:21,732
- Wow!
- [gasps]

303
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:26,537
- Whoa!
- [moaning]

304
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:29,207
- Oh, my!
- Jeepers.

305
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:30,374
What is that?

306
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:32,777
That, my friend,
is a magical combination
of corn flour,

307
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:38,149
dehydrated cheese solids,
BHA, BHT and good old MSG,

308
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:42,253
a.k.a., the chip.
Nacho cheese flavor.

309
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:45,823
- Over here!
Toss me one of those!
- More please! More.

310
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:47,592
Yeah, Verne, those were good!

311
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:51,395
It's all good.
And we're going
over there. Tonight!

312
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:53,731
Yeah!

313
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:56,534
[RJ] Welcome to suburbia.

314
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:58,836
- Wow!
- Look at that!

315
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:01,405
[gasping]

316
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:04,175
Hey, Mom, look at us!
Look at us!

317
00:19:04,177 --> 00:19:06,511
[Lou] Oh, my!
Hon, look at this.

318
00:19:06,513 --> 00:19:09,714
- Jeepers.
- How's that tail, Verne?

319
00:19:09,716 --> 00:19:12,517
Listen, if anybody
in this family gets hurt,

320
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:13,518
I'm holding you responsible.

321
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:18,656
They're having a good time.
I'll take responsibility
for that.

322
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:19,891
- This is neat.
- Look at that.

323
00:19:19,893 --> 00:19:21,459
- Hey, Spike, look at that.
- Hey, Verno,

324
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:24,896
I took a few clippings
out of my quills to do
a little comparison.

325
00:19:24,898 --> 00:19:28,366
Look at this,
the grass seems to be
greener over here.

326
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:31,536
Verne, are you certain
you came to the same place?

327
00:19:31,538 --> 00:19:33,271
Yeah, 'cause
the raccoon says...

328
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:34,772
OK, enough about him.
I get it.

329
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:38,843
So he can do a couple of tricks.
I mean, it's not like
he can walk on water.

330
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:43,481
Hey, everybody!
This way to the food!

331
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:46,517
- That thing's huge!
- What is that?

332
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,920
That is an SUV.
Humans ride around in it

333
00:19:48,922 --> 00:19:52,190
because they are slowly
losing their ability
to walk.

334
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:56,327
- Jeepers, it's so big!
- How many humans
fit in there?

335
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:58,663
Usually? One.

336
00:19:58,665 --> 00:20:02,333
Hi, this is Gladys Sharp.
Your president?

337
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:04,702
Of the homeowner's
association? Right.

338
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:05,736
- Jeepers.
- What is that?

339
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:09,207
Easy, easy, don't worry.
That's just a human being.

340
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:11,876
And they are just as scared
of us as we are of them.

341
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:14,912
Now, if a human does happen
to see you, just lay down,

342
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:18,249
roll over and give your
privates a good licking.
They love it.

343
00:20:18,251 --> 00:20:22,386
The charter, which you signed,
says the grass is supposed
to be two inches,

344
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:26,257
and according
to my measuring stick,
yours is 2.5.

345
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:29,594
Could we just get
the food and go? Really,
do they have it or not?

346
00:20:29,596 --> 00:20:34,865
Didn't you see it?
It was in the box. They've
always got food with them.

347
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:38,869
We eat to live,
these guys live to eat.

348
00:20:38,871 --> 00:20:40,938
Let me show you
what I'm talking about.

349
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,674
[RJ] The human mouth
is called a "pie hole."

350
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:46,611
The human being
is called a "couch potato."

351
00:20:46,613 --> 00:20:48,980
That is a device
to summon food.

352
00:20:48,982 --> 00:20:51,716
That is one of the many
voices of food.

353
00:20:51,718 --> 00:20:54,652
That is the portal
for the passing
of the food.

354
00:20:54,654 --> 00:20:58,556
That is one of the many
food transportation
vehicles.

355
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:00,891
Humans bring the food,
take the food,

356
00:21:00,893 --> 00:21:02,627
ship the food,
they drive the food,

357
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:07,331
they wear the food!
That gets the food hot.
That keeps the food cold.

358
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:10,301
That...
I'm not sure what that is.

359
00:21:10,303 --> 00:21:12,036
- [children cheering]
- Aah!

360
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:14,338
What do you know? Food!

361
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:17,742
That is the altar
where they worship food.

362
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:19,877
That's what they eat
when they eat too much.

363
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:23,481
That gets rid of guilt
so they can eat more food.

364
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:26,584
Food! Food! Food! Food!

365
00:21:26,586 --> 00:21:27,418
Food!

366
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:30,588
So you think they have enough?

367
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:33,624
Well, they don't.
For humans,
enough is never enough!

368
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:38,829
- [gasping]
- And what do they do with
the stuff they don't eat?

369
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:43,801
They put it in gleaming,
silver cans,

370
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,736
just for us.

371
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:49,073
Sweet jeepers.

372
00:21:49,075 --> 00:21:51,942
- Dig in!
- [cheering]

373
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:55,680
- Good, isn't it?
- OK.

374
00:21:55,682 --> 00:22:00,551
- Wow.
- Share there,
everyone, share.

375
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:05,856
That's a diaper.
And that does come out
of a wazoo.

376
00:22:05,858 --> 00:22:09,660
So, what do you think?
Was I right or was I right?

377
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:11,329
And these things
are just the scraps!

378
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:14,699
Wait'll you see
what comes in the boxes,
packages and cans!

379
00:22:14,701 --> 00:22:17,101
I'm telling you,
stick with me,
and in one week

380
00:22:17,103 --> 00:22:19,804
we will gather
enough food to...

381
00:22:19,806 --> 00:22:22,006
- To feed a bear.
- What?

382
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:26,677
- Just a figure of speech.
- <i>[beeping]</i>

383
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:30,781
Halt! Intruders! Intruders!
Get out, all of you.

384
00:22:30,783 --> 00:22:33,651
What is it, baby?
[screaming]

385
00:22:33,653 --> 00:22:37,588
- What are you doing?
- You said to lick our...

386
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,824
No! Nix that! Run!

387
00:22:39,826 --> 00:22:41,992
- Run!
- Get outta here!

388
00:22:41,994 --> 00:22:44,028
Run!

389
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:45,796
- Shoo!
- To the hedge!

390
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:49,033
Get out of here!
I just mopped this patio!

391
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:51,068
Filthy vermin!

392
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,741
Verne's right,
that was horrible.

393
00:22:56,743 --> 00:22:57,942
- You kids OK?
- Stay close.

394
00:22:57,944 --> 00:23:02,446
- We'll find other food, right?
- See? That's what
I was talking about!

395
00:23:02,448 --> 00:23:04,382
These humans
don't want us around.

396
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:07,752
So we scared her,
and she overreacted.
No biggie.

397
00:23:07,754 --> 00:23:09,720
No biggie? Oh, that is
what we call a biggie.

398
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:14,458
Come on, think about
the food. It was worth it
for that food, huh?

399
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,494
That stuff is to die for!

400
00:23:16,496 --> 00:23:18,396
[groaning]

401
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:19,597
Let me rephrase that.

402
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:21,799
No, to die for.
You nailed that part.

403
00:23:21,801 --> 00:23:26,670
Look, maybe our little
forest life looks primitive
to a guy with a bag.

404
00:23:26,672 --> 00:23:27,938
- What?
- But I think I speak

405
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,608
for the whole family
when I say we want nothing

406
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:34,745
to do with anything
that's over that hedge.

407
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:36,580
- Oh, come on!
- I'm done.

408
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:40,117
You haven't even
tried doughnuts yet!
You wanna store fat?

409
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:42,420
That is the way
to store some fat.

410
00:23:42,422 --> 00:23:43,821
You'll be sweatin'
through the winter!

411
00:23:43,823 --> 00:23:48,793
- We'll eat the bark, right?
- OK, all right,
you guys sleep on it!

412
00:23:48,795 --> 00:23:53,664
Good idea. I'm gonna
check back with you.

413
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:56,600
Shoot!

414
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:58,969
Almost had 'em.

415
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:06,043
- [Verne]
Good night, Heather.
- Good night.

416
00:24:06,045 --> 00:24:07,678
- Good night, Ozzie.
- Good night.

417
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,713
- Good night, Lou.
- Good night.

418
00:24:09,715 --> 00:24:10,915
- Night, Penny.
- Good night.

419
00:24:10,917 --> 00:24:12,817
- Good night, Hammy.
- Good night.

420
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:13,984
- Night, Bucky.
- Good night.

421
00:24:13,986 --> 00:24:15,986
- Good night, Spike.
- Good night, Uncle Verne.

422
00:24:15,988 --> 00:24:18,122
- Good night, Quillo.
- Night, Uncle Verne.

423
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:20,858
When we wake up,
only 273 days left
till winter.

424
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:25,563
- That's enough, Verne.
- Good night, 273.

425
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:28,699
Spuddies...

426
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:33,838
Cooler... Wagon...
Redder wagon.

427
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,873
Time's up, RJ.

428
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:38,809
But I have
six more days! No!

429
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:41,579
No! Aaah!

430
00:24:41,581 --> 00:24:42,713
[gasping]

431
00:24:42,715 --> 00:24:45,616
OK. Four paws, fur.

432
00:24:45,618 --> 00:24:48,085
Still alive, still alive.

433
00:24:48,087 --> 00:24:51,589
So, what are you saying?
You want me to take 'em
to his house?

434
00:24:51,591 --> 00:24:53,591
- No.
- Then what are you saying?

435
00:24:53,593 --> 00:24:55,259
Jimmy was pushing me
on the bus.

436
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:57,928
- He likes you.
- No way, he's a creep.

437
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:00,798
Next time he shoves you,
beat him up.

438
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,967
Yes!

439
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:05,603
[grunting]

440
00:25:05,605 --> 00:25:09,540
OK, kids, dive in.
There it is.
Bark for breakfast!

441
00:25:09,542 --> 00:25:13,043
- I want a doughnut!
- I want pizza.

442
00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:15,212
[Penny] No, you don't.

443
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:19,283
[buzzing]

444
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:25,022
[groaning]

445
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:34,765
[crunching]
OK. This is great.

446
00:25:34,767 --> 00:25:37,668
[crunching]

447
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:42,940
Granted, it takes
some time to chew.

448
00:25:42,942 --> 00:25:45,309
But that... [swallows]

449
00:25:45,311 --> 00:25:47,545
That was very satisfying.

450
00:25:47,547 --> 00:25:51,615
And, by the way,
lots of fiber in there too.

451
00:25:51,617 --> 00:25:52,182
Mmm!

452
00:25:52,184 --> 00:25:56,720
- Lots.
- I gotta admit,
that does look tasty.

453
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:58,222
[spits]
What are you doing here?

454
00:25:58,224 --> 00:26:03,127
I'm here to help you
with your...
foraging thing.

455
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:04,028
Look, Verne,

456
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:06,931
you said a word yesterday
about your little gang here.

457
00:26:06,933 --> 00:26:10,801
It starts with an F,
do you remember what it was?

458
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:12,603
- Family?
- Right, right, that.

459
00:26:12,605 --> 00:26:14,605
You know,
that got me right here.

460
00:26:14,607 --> 00:26:16,740
You see, Verne, I used
to have all of that.

461
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:21,245
My own place,
surrounded by loved ones,

462
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:22,279
universal remote.

463
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:25,182
But then all that
went away with...

464
00:26:25,184 --> 00:26:27,217
the weed hacker incident.

465
00:26:27,219 --> 00:26:31,055
- [shudders] Oh, God.
- Oh, come here.

466
00:26:31,057 --> 00:26:33,724
Yeah, that feels good,
doesn't it?

467
00:26:33,726 --> 00:26:35,893
- Oh, brother.
- Jeepers, Verne.

468
00:26:35,895 --> 00:26:38,662
We could always use
the extra hand there,
you know.

469
00:26:38,664 --> 00:26:43,233
The weed hacker, Verne.
The weed hacker.

470
00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:44,234
OK.

471
00:26:44,236 --> 00:26:49,006
Not your problem.
I'll just go.

472
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,709
This is me...

473
00:26:51,711 --> 00:26:52,676
going.

474
00:26:52,678 --> 00:26:54,111
- Been nice.
- Don't hit.

475
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:55,312
[RJ] Really nice
getting to know you.

476
00:26:55,314 --> 00:26:58,749
Hey, I'm sure I'll see you
around the forest.

477
00:26:58,751 --> 00:27:01,185
- Take care.
- All right, all right.

478
00:27:01,187 --> 00:27:04,288
- Hey, uh, RJ?
- [sobbing]

479
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:05,789
You can... you can stay.

480
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:08,392
- [laughing]
Come here, ya big lug!
- No.

481
00:27:08,394 --> 00:27:10,794
I knew beneath this hard,
crispy outside

482
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:12,896
there was a soft,
nougat-y center in there.

483
00:27:12,898 --> 00:27:17,101
- Do you mind if
I call you Uncle Verne?
- With every bone in my body.

484
00:27:17,103 --> 00:27:20,871
Great. Hey,
can I work with Hammy?

485
00:27:20,873 --> 00:27:22,673
Wanna help me find my nuts?

486
00:27:22,675 --> 00:27:24,708
Very tempting, Hammy,
very tempting.

487
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:27,678
But first,
I want to show you this.

488
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,047
- [sniffing]
- You like this cookie?

489
00:27:30,049 --> 00:27:30,981
Ohh ho ho ho!

490
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:34,051
- Well, this cookie's junk!
- I like a cookie.

491
00:27:34,053 --> 00:27:34,985
Easy, easy. Don't worry.

492
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:36,920
I know where we can get
some cookies so valuable

493
00:27:36,922 --> 00:27:42,092
that they are
hand delivered
by uniformed officers.

494
00:27:42,094 --> 00:27:45,095
- The Doyles'
is the yellow house.
- They only ordered one box.

495
00:27:45,097 --> 00:27:47,431
There they are.
America's most coveted
cookies.

496
00:27:47,433 --> 00:27:50,968
Love Handles, Skinny Mints,
Neener Neeners
and Smackeroons.

497
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:54,805
- And guess what?
They're all yours!
- Hoo hoo! Aah!

498
00:27:54,807 --> 00:27:58,142
Whoa, Hamilton.
Hold on there, fella.

499
00:27:58,144 --> 00:28:00,744
I love your energy,
but you can't take 'em.

500
00:28:00,746 --> 00:28:02,112
- You said they're mine.
- They will be,

501
00:28:02,114 --> 00:28:06,850
if we successfully marry
your manic energy
to my brilliant plan!

502
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:09,153
- You with me, kid?
- I... I... I...

503
00:28:09,155 --> 00:28:10,688
The I's have it!
Let's ride.

504
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:13,390
[girl] Mrs. Johansson
was allergic to chocolate.

505
00:28:13,392 --> 00:28:14,925
- Really?
- Yeah, if she eats it,

506
00:28:14,927 --> 00:28:19,029
- her face explodes
or something.
- That is, like, so unfair.

507
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:21,298
- Wait, wait.
How many boxes of...?
- Hey!

508
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:24,101
You stay away
from those cookies.
They're mine!

509
00:28:24,103 --> 00:28:25,736
- [tapping] Ahem!
- Aah!

510
00:28:25,738 --> 00:28:28,772
This guy's not coming, is he?
I don't want him to.

511
00:28:28,774 --> 00:28:30,774
Oh, we have so much work to do.

512
00:28:30,776 --> 00:28:33,310
Come on,
step into my office.
Now, listen up.

513
00:28:33,312 --> 00:28:37,715
What we're going for here
is a vicious, man-eating,
rabid squirrel.

514
00:28:37,717 --> 00:28:40,284
- Can you handle that?
- Um, excuse me?

515
00:28:40,286 --> 00:28:41,185
Yes... Hammy.

516
00:28:41,187 --> 00:28:46,724
OK. Rabbits aren't vicious.
They're all cute
and cuddly, so...

517
00:28:46,726 --> 00:28:49,059
Rabid, not rabbit.

518
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:49,927
Oh... What?

519
00:28:49,929 --> 00:28:53,931
- OK. So first we're
gonna muss the hair.
- Ow, ow, ow!

520
00:28:53,933 --> 00:28:56,300
That's looking good.
All right, now we're gonna...

521
00:28:56,302 --> 00:28:58,902
[spits] We're gonna
mat the fur a little bit.

522
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:02,172
A little puff on the tail...
Stop it! Puffier.

523
00:29:02,174 --> 00:29:03,006
Liking that a lot.

524
00:29:03,008 --> 00:29:05,209
Show me that wild look
in your eye. Come on!

525
00:29:05,211 --> 00:29:12,116
- Oh! I can burp my ABCs!
[burping] A, B, C.
- Hammy!

526
00:29:12,118 --> 00:29:15,953
I really need you
to focus right now, OK?

527
00:29:15,955 --> 00:29:17,254
- OK.
- Thank you.

528
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:18,455
Let's see. There we...

529
00:29:18,457 --> 00:29:19,289
Hang on a minute.

530
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:23,127
Not that, not that.
No, no. Aha!

531
00:29:23,129 --> 00:29:25,829
- Nice!
- Ooh!

532
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:29,032
Hammy?

533
00:29:31,302 --> 00:29:35,539
[chuckling] Done! Now, come on.
I'll be right behind you.

534
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:38,342
Go on, get out there.
Shoo, shoo!

535
00:29:38,344 --> 00:29:43,180
I am a crazy rabid squirrel!
I want my cookies!

536
00:29:43,182 --> 00:29:48,118
[babbling] I'm rabid!
I'm foaming at the mouth.

537
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:52,923
I'm foaming,
very scary rabid squirrel.

538
00:29:52,925 --> 00:29:53,557
[both] Rabies!

539
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:55,959
- Hey, it's working!
- Behind you!

540
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:58,896
I know.
You're right behind me...

541
00:29:59,030 --> 00:29:59,963
Got it! Stand back!

542
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:03,433
- No, no, no, no! Oh, no!
- Take that!

543
00:30:03,435 --> 00:30:05,569
Walk it off!
Walk that one off!

544
00:30:05,571 --> 00:30:07,070
What's going on?
Is that Hammy?

545
00:30:07,072 --> 00:30:09,072
Everything's
under control. Go back.

546
00:30:09,074 --> 00:30:10,174
You call that under control?

547
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:12,176
- He's under attack!
- He's working!

548
00:30:12,178 --> 00:30:14,912
- I'm coming, Hammy!
- Verne! No!

549
00:30:14,914 --> 00:30:17,948
What are you doing?
Watch out!

550
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:27,491
- Hold still!
I got it! Stay still.
- Help me! Get off of me!

551
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:29,526
- Yuck!
- Gross!

552
00:30:29,528 --> 00:30:32,362
- Eww! Nasty!
- Eww, eww! Oh, my God,
this is so gross!

553
00:30:32,364 --> 00:30:37,568
Verne! That was great!
You, my friend, are a natural.

554
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:41,939
Or, should I say, au naturel.

555
00:30:41,941 --> 00:30:44,241
Huh?

556
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,210
Oh.

557
00:30:46,212 --> 00:30:47,911
Hammy, you were awesome,
my man!

558
00:30:47,913 --> 00:30:52,182
You had me scared.
I was about to come out and
beat you with a book myself.

559
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:55,619
You're all right, aren't ya?
Of course you are.
You are Hammy!

560
00:30:55,621 --> 00:30:59,623
Those bruises are gonna heal.
You know what?
Chicks dig scars.

561
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:00,924
- There!
- Over there!

562
00:31:00,926 --> 00:31:04,928
That's where
the squirrel attacked us!
He has rabies or something.

563
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:07,297
There was this gross,
naked, amphibian thing.

564
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:09,433
- Reptile.
- It's OK, girls.

565
00:31:09,435 --> 00:31:14,071
Go inside, have a cookie,
turn on the TV
and calm down.

566
00:31:14,073 --> 00:31:14,605
Thanks, Mom.

567
00:31:14,607 --> 00:31:18,442
Sorry, Janis, did I hear
them say "rabid squirrel"?

568
00:31:18,444 --> 00:31:20,377
Oh, I think they might
just be overreacting.

569
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:24,514
What if they're not?
What if we have a potential
pandemic on our hands?

570
00:31:24,516 --> 00:31:27,184
Vermin running loose,
spreading disease

571
00:31:27,186 --> 00:31:30,387
and lowering
our property values?

572
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:34,091
Yeah. I have a casserole
in the oven. Gotta run.

573
00:31:34,093 --> 00:31:35,459
Fine. Worry about
your casserole,

574
00:31:35,461 --> 00:31:41,632
and I'll worry about the end of
suburban peace and tranquility!

575
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:45,335
[RJ] That's right. Don't push.
Plenty for everybody.

576
00:31:45,337 --> 00:31:48,538
Got a box right over here
for ya, Penny.

577
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,940
That is good. Eat up!

578
00:31:49,942 --> 00:31:52,075
Anything that tastes this good
has to be good for you.

579
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:55,178
Feel buzzing in the back
of your skull?
That's called a sugar rush.

580
00:31:55,180 --> 00:32:00,450
It's what keeps humans going,
why they don't hibernate.
Add a little of this,

581
00:32:00,452 --> 00:32:05,155
and what usually takes you
all summer will take us a week.

582
00:32:05,157 --> 00:32:06,056
I like it! I like it!

583
00:32:06,058 --> 00:32:12,095
Hold on, Hamsquad.
The last thing
you need is caffeine.

584
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:14,197
That's right.
Come on, dig in.

is just the beginning.

Yeah, Verne,

The log was full!

- Full of junk.
- So, what are you
saying there?

801
00:44:57,429 --> 00:45:02,999
That the food we gather

RJ wouldn't do that.

You have got

there's something
wrong with him?

00:51:02,493 --> 00:51:07,196
Now, the traps are set
here, here, here,

918
00:51:07,198 --> 00:51:11,467
here, here, here,
here, here, here,

00:51:11,469 --> 00:51:16,772
here, here, here and here.

Here, here, here, here.

00:51:22,713 --> 00:51:25,247
Big one here, here,

922
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:28,217
- and maybe a few over here.
- Gee, is that all?

923
00:51:28,219 --> 00:51:32,154
No. There's a bunch
of red lights all over here.

924
00:51:32,156 --> 00:51:33,355
OK, Verne?
Looking a little green.

925
00:51:33,357 --> 00:51:36,125
I blacked out
for a second there,
but I get the idea.

926
00:51:36,127 --> 00:51:39,728
There's lights, traps...
I might need
to change my shell.

927
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:42,298
[RJ] OK, this is us.

928
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:43,833
- Can I be the car?
- I wanna be the car!

929

- I'm the car.
You be the shoe.
- The shoe is lame.

Why don't you be
that snazzy-looking iron?

Hey, it's not important!

932
00:51:51,843 --> 00:51:54,710
Besides, I'm the car.
I'm always the car.

933
00:51:54,712 --> 00:51:57,880
The plan works in three
simple steps. Step one,
kill the lights.

934
00:51:57,882 --> 00:52:02,618
Step two, get inside.
Step three, get out
with mountain of food.

is like a fortress.

Doors, impenetrable.

Literally, the collar.

939

It's like a key that opens
the door and if...

he's just gonna hand over
his collar to you?

- Me?

You, Stella, will get that cat

his collar by using...

I'm a skunk.

But I'm looking inside,
Stella, and I see a fox.

on that human.

1069
01:00:19,984 --> 01:00:22,951
- I'm on it, RJ.
- No, Heather. Wait!

1070
01:00:22,953 --> 01:00:24,620
The tingle, the tingle.

1071
01:00:24,622 --> 01:00:27,222
RJ! The wagon's full,
let's get out of here.

1072
01:00:27,224 --> 01:00:29,291
Hang on, Vincent,
this'll only take a second

1073
01:00:29,293 --> 01:00:30,826
- Vincent?
- Where?

1074
01:00:30,828 --> 01:00:33,128
- Who's Vincent?
- Oh, Verne, Vincent.

1075
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:35,964
Simple slip of the bear.
Tongue! I... er...

1076
01:00:35,966 --> 01:00:41,069
Just bear with me is what
I meant to say. [chuckling]

1077
01:00:41,071 --> 01:00:43,405
There's no bear.

[shudders, retches]

1081
01:01:01,257 --> 01:01:03,258
Oh, Heather!

1082
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:08,163
There's a dead, white rat
on my staircase.

1083
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:12,834
I thought you were dead.

1084
01:01:12,836 --> 01:01:15,070
I learned from the best, Dad.

1085
01:01:15,072 --> 01:01:17,239
That's my girl.

1086
01:01:17,241 --> 01:01:19,107
[grunts] Come to Papa.

1087
01:01:19,109 --> 01:01:21,743
We better hurry.
We don't have much time.

1088
01:01:21,745 --> 01:01:23,045
- What's going on, RJ?
- Nothing!

1089
01:01:23,047 --> 01:01:25,714
Let's get out of here
because we have
what we need.

1090
01:01:25,716 --> 01:01:27,783
- No, we don't.
- What are you
talking about?

1091
01:01:27,785 --> 01:01:29,718
- We have more than enough.
- Hey, listen.

1092
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:32,954
I've got this long
to hand over that wagon
of food to a homicidal bear.

1093
01:01:32,956 --> 01:01:37,893
If these Spuddies aren't
on the menu, then I will be.
Now let go of my tail.

1094
01:01:37,895 --> 01:01:42,798
- What?
- Let go!

1095
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:47,102
Hey, whoa!

1096
01:01:47,104 --> 01:01:49,004
- Huh?
- [gasps]

1097
01:01:49,006 --> 01:01:50,338
Uh, I'm sorry, I've gotta go.

1098
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:56,878
Stella, Stella,
where are you going?
Stella!

1099
01:01:57,780 --> 01:02:00,382
- Aaah!
- Stella!

1100
01:02:00,384 --> 01:02:06,421
Look, it's not you.
It won't work, OK,
because I'm a...

1101
01:02:06,856 --> 01:02:07,356
Skunk!

1102
01:02:07,357 --> 01:02:11,426
Yeah, that. Sorry
you have to see this.

1103
01:02:11,428 --> 01:02:13,495
Fire in the hole!

1104
01:02:16,999 --> 01:02:21,236
- [coughing] Oh, my...
- This smell
doesn't bother you?

1105
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:24,873
No. This face
was bred for beauty.

1106
01:02:24,875 --> 01:02:26,775
I cannot smell a thing.

1107
01:02:26,777 --> 01:02:30,112
You can't smell?

1108
01:02:35,952 --> 01:02:39,855
To the door!
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

1109
01:02:39,857 --> 01:02:42,257
- Run!
- This way!

1110
01:02:45,294 --> 01:02:48,029
[muffled] Let's party.

1111
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:50,298
- Bunnies!
- Aah! [grunts]

1112
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:52,501
Flee, my love.

1113
01:02:53,469 --> 01:02:55,337
Run, that way. Outside!

1114
01:02:55,339 --> 01:02:59,274
- Move, kids! Come on!
- [all grunt]

1115
01:03:01,511 --> 01:03:06,081
Buenos días, reptile.

1116

You've just been verminated.

[sniffing]
Whoa! You stink.

1119
01:03:15,192 --> 01:03:18,493
That's because you let them
into my... house!

1120
01:03:18,495 --> 01:03:20,862
- Those...
- Hey, Nancy,
stop your honkin'.

1121
01:03:20,864 --> 01:03:25,333
These little guys
will be disposed of
quickly and humanely.

1122
01:03:25,335 --> 01:03:30,472
No! Not humanely.
As inhumanely as possible.

1123
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:36,444
It was a pleasure
doing business
with you, ma'am.

1124

[wheels squeaking]

01:03:51,227 --> 01:03:57,365
- What's he gonna do
to us, Mama?
- I don't know, baby.

1126
01:03:57,367 --> 01:03:59,901
I don't wanna die, Dad.
Not for real.

1127
01:03:59,903 --> 01:04:05,106
There, there, there,
sweetheart. We'll be OK.

1128
01:04:07,877 --> 01:04:10,345
You were right about him,
Verne.

1129
01:04:10,347 --> 01:04:13,582
We shoulda listened.
Sorry there.

1130
01:04:13,584 --> 01:04:16,384
No.

1131
01:04:16,386 --> 01:04:21,323
I knew we couldn't trust him,
and I got us into this.

1132
01:04:21,325 --> 01:04:25,060
I should've known better.

1133
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:34,202
- [Vincent] Wow!
- Vincent?

1134
01:04:34,204 --> 01:04:37,038
So I was on my way
down here to kill you.

1135
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:42,210
But I stopped to watch the show,
and I gotta say...

1136
01:04:42,345 --> 01:04:47,949
that, right there,
is a thing of beauty.

1137
01:04:49,185 --> 01:04:52,554
That is the most vicious,
deceitful,

1138
01:04:52,556 --> 01:04:57,459
self-serving thing
I've ever seen.
[chuckling]

1139
01:04:57,461 --> 01:04:58,960
Classic RJ.

1140
01:04:58,962 --> 01:05:04,332
You take the food,
and they take the fall.

1141
01:05:07,603 --> 01:05:11,640
You keep this up,
you're gonna end up
just like me.

1142
01:05:11,642 --> 01:05:15,310
Having everything
you ever wanted.

1143
01:05:15,312 --> 01:05:18,046
But I already had that.

1144
01:05:18,048 --> 01:05:21,283
What, them?
Who are you kidding?

1145
01:05:21,285 --> 01:05:25,687
You said it yourself,
you're a family of one.

1146
01:05:25,689 --> 01:05:27,222
Always will be.

1147
01:05:27,224 --> 01:05:30,125
It's how guys like
you and me survive.

1148
01:05:30,127 --> 01:05:33,194
So a few saps
got hurt in the process.

1149
01:05:33,196 --> 01:05:39,367
Tough. That's life.
Trust me, you don't need them.

1150
01:05:40,036 --> 01:05:43,705
Actually, I do.

1151
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:49,110
And right now,
they really need me.

1152

- There goes my back again.
- Are you OK?

You sorry sack of rat dung.

Whoa, Stella,
this is a rescue.
I'm rescuing you.

1158

I'm gonna gas you so hard
your grandchildren'll stink.

- What's that?

- Bear!
- Oh, bear!

What?

- We're out of control!
- We can drive.

- It's just like

- What?

- Cool.

Just let him in.

Filthy creatures.

Penny, Lou,

That's it! Verne,
get everybody out of here.
I'll distract him.

1229
01:10:23,987 --> 01:10:27,455
- Are you crazy? He'll kill you.
- Well, I'm the one he wants.

1230
01:10:27,457 --> 01:10:29,724
Take care of your family,
Verne.

1231
01:10:29,726 --> 01:10:30,959
I intend to.
The whole family.

1232
01:10:30,961 --> 01:10:35,763
- There's got to be
something we can do.
- There's no time.

01:10:37,766 --> 01:10:40,268
[both] Hammy!

Hey, Vincent.
You were right.

Now, Hammy. Go, go, go!

Good job, everybody.
That's teamwork.

1254

Come here, Hammy, come here.
You are a genius, my boy.

Glad it's working for ya.

that was a Depelter Turbo?

Officer, please.
It was that Verminator.

He sold it to me.
This has nothing
to do with me.

Hey, hey, it was in your yard.

1264
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:32,907
Your name's on the contract,
so tell it to the judge.

[Stella] Come on, big boy.
You're coming with me.

1282

You know, RJ, um,
just for the record,

1283
01:14:21,191 --> 01:14:24,192
if you had told us
that all that food
you were trying to get

1284
01:14:24,194 --> 01:14:27,495
was to pay back an angry bear,
we would've given it to you.

1285
01:14:27,497 --> 01:14:31,866
- Really?
- Yeah, that's
what families do.

1286
01:14:31,868 --> 01:14:33,734
They look out for each other.

1287
01:14:33,736 --> 01:14:35,770
I've never had
anything like that.

1288
01:14:35,772 --> 01:14:39,674
I know.
But believe me, this...

1289
01:14:39,676 --> 01:14:42,543
This is the gateway
to the good life.

1290
01:14:42,545 --> 01:14:43,911
Wish you would've
told me that sooner.

1291
01:14:43,913 --> 01:14:47,915
Well, that's bad communication.
Also something families do.

1292
01:14:47,917 --> 01:14:52,119
So, what do you say?
You wanna be a part of it?

1293
01:14:55,657 --> 01:15:01,762
Come here, come here.
[sobbing] I promised
I wouldn't do this. OK.

[RJ] OK, OK.

1297
01:15:07,537 --> 01:15:09,237
What a first week of spring.

1298
01:15:09,239 --> 01:15:13,741
Wait a minute!
That means there's only
267 days left till winter.

1299
01:15:13,743 --> 01:15:15,076
What are we gonna do for food?

Yes, Hammy.

1346
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:52,299
- And they call it a TV.
- [Bucky] Wicked cool!

1347
01:17:52,301 --> 01:17:57,171
[RJ] Humans feel an inner
need to connect with
the world around them.

1348
01:17:57,173 --> 01:17:58,305
[Lou]
That is super-duper.

1349
01:17:58,307 --> 01:18:00,141
They also feel a need
to sit on their fat butts.

Watching TV fulfills
both needs at the same time.

Wow. Interesting.

[Hammy] Like Khan
in Star Trek II!

The Genesis Project
was in the hands
of the Enterprise,

1363
01:18:27,270 --> 01:18:29,837
but Khan had his plan
to steal the invention!

1364
01:18:29,839 --> 01:18:31,105
[Verne] Well,
that was specific.

1365
01:18:31,107 --> 01:18:32,807
[Hammy] I saw it on TNT,
a retrospective.

1366
01:18:32,809 --> 01:18:35,843
