1
00:02:13,413 --> 00:02:17,645
Ain't you afraid?
Of old Ygor? No!

2
00:02:19,186 --> 00:02:20,483
Oh!

3
00:02:31,832 --> 00:02:35,825
I say that I, for one, will not.
Enough!

4
00:02:35,902 --> 00:02:38,370
He'll be met exactly as arranged.

5
00:02:38,438 --> 00:02:40,372
Now, friends, on his deathbed,

6
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,341
the old Baron Frankenstein gave me
this chest of papers...

7
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,709
to deliver to his son,
and deliver it I shall.

8
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,408
Haven't we had
enough of that name here?
<i>Yes.</i>

9
00:02:49,483 --> 00:02:51,974
There was a time when our village
was prosperous and happy.

10
00:02:52,052 --> 00:02:55,215
Look at it now.
Forsaken, desolate,

11
00:02:55,288 --> 00:02:57,222
shunned by every traveler,
and why?

12
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:59,349
Because of these Frankensteins!

13
00:02:59,426 --> 00:03:03,226
We live in the black shadow
of that cursed place up on the hill,

14
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:07,232
where only that crazy Ygor,
with his broken neck, dares to stay.

15
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:12,363
And now we go to the railway station
to welcome another Frankenstein.

16
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,931
This one is probably just as bad
as his father,

17
00:03:16,009 --> 00:03:20,070
who created a monster
in the devil's own image.

18
00:03:20,146 --> 00:03:22,011
It's in the blood,
I tell you.

19
00:03:22,082 --> 00:03:25,449
We've said these same words a thousand
times, and they get us nowhere.

20
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,977
Fine talk, Herr Inspector,
fine talk!

21
00:03:29,055 --> 00:03:33,116
But Baron Frankenstein does arrive
tonight to claim his heritage.

22
00:03:33,193 --> 00:03:35,593
And then what?
Yes! What then?

23
00:03:35,662 --> 00:03:39,621
That is true,
but he'll find no friends here.

24
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:42,600
Nothing but locked doors
and darkened windows...

25
00:03:42,669 --> 00:03:44,933
Iocked hearts and bitter hatred.

26
00:03:45,005 --> 00:03:48,941
Let that, too, be a part
of the Frankenstein heritage.

27
00:03:49,009 --> 00:03:50,101
Come, gentlemen.

28
00:04:01,388 --> 00:04:03,856
We'll be there soon, darling.

29
00:04:03,924 --> 00:04:06,085
That's good,
so I can see Amelia.

30
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,562
That's right. Amelia will be there
waiting for you and so glad to see you.

31
00:04:25,478 --> 00:04:28,072
What strange-looking country.

32
00:04:29,549 --> 00:04:31,312
Not much like America, is it?

33
00:04:31,384 --> 00:04:34,842
On my first trip to Europe,
I was prepared for anything,

34
00:04:34,921 --> 00:04:36,855
but, well, I'm glad we went
to London and Paris first.

35
00:04:36,923 --> 00:04:39,448
We must be getting close
to the village now.

36
00:04:39,526 --> 00:04:41,187
<i>It's exciting, isn't it?</i>

37
00:04:41,261 --> 00:04:46,289
Out there in the darkness
a new life lies before us. Ha ha!

38
00:04:46,366 --> 00:04:48,561
No more college classrooms
or faculty meetings.

39
00:04:48,635 --> 00:04:51,468
I feel rather like an explorer.
That's what it is.

40
00:04:51,538 --> 00:04:53,904
We're going to explore something
so foreign to us...

41
00:04:53,974 --> 00:04:55,965
that we can't even imagine
what it's going to be like.

42
00:04:56,042 --> 00:04:58,636
A medieval castle.
I wonder if there's a moat.

43
00:04:58,712 --> 00:05:01,772
And a drawbridge.
And a great tall, dark tower.

44
00:05:01,848 --> 00:05:04,646
And battlements. And perhaps
there's a haunted room.

45
00:05:04,718 --> 00:05:07,687
Yes, there's sure to be
a haunted room.

46
00:05:07,754 --> 00:05:10,746
The castle itself is
supposed to be haunted.

47
00:05:10,824 --> 00:05:12,883
Because of...
Yes.

48
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:15,189
Because of the things
my father did there.

49
00:05:15,261 --> 00:05:17,252
I remember the stories my mother
used to tell me...

50
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,764
when I was quite young in England.

51
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,824
It wasn't my father's fault
that the being he created...

52
00:05:21,901 --> 00:05:23,664
became a senseless,
murderous monster.

53
00:05:23,737 --> 00:05:27,935
He was right. You understand that,
don't you, dear? He was right.

54
00:05:28,008 --> 00:05:31,000
It was the unforeseen blunder
of a stupid assistant...

55
00:05:31,077 --> 00:05:36,344
that gave his creation the brain
of a killer instead of a normal one.

56
00:05:37,417 --> 00:05:40,875
And how my father was made to suffer
for that mistake.

57
00:05:40,954 --> 00:05:44,583
His name has become synonymous
with horror and monsters.

58
00:05:44,658 --> 00:05:46,990
Why, nine out of ten people...

59
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,460
call that misshapen creature
of my father's experiments...

60
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:51,224
<i>[Man]</i>

The baron is in, I know.
Yes, but...

A policeman.

Herr Baron Frankenstein?
Yes.

178
00:15:32,878 --> 00:15:36,006
I am Inspector Krogh
of the district police.

<i>I am glad to see you,</i>

Benson,
take the inspector's cape.
Yes, sir.

00:15:50,296 --> 00:15:53,231
Won't you come in?
Thank you.

182
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:00,898
Come over
and dry out by the fire.
Thank you.

183
00:16:00,973 --> 00:16:04,465
I've been studying
some old papers of my father's.

184
00:16:04,543 --> 00:16:06,534
Have a brandy?

185
00:16:06,612 --> 00:16:08,580
Thank you, no.

186
00:16:08,648 --> 00:16:11,583
I have come here, Herr Baron,
to assure you of protection.

187
00:16:11,651 --> 00:16:15,553
Protection? From whom?
From a virulent and fatal poison.

188
00:16:15,621 --> 00:16:17,953
Oh, am I to be poisoned then?

189
00:16:18,024 --> 00:16:21,482
You are poisoned already
by your name.

190
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,222
Well, to the best of my knowledge,
it has served my family faithfully...

191
00:16:24,297 --> 00:16:26,060
for over 700 years.

192
00:16:26,132 --> 00:16:28,794
You recommend that I change it
to, say, Smith?

193
00:16:28,868 --> 00:16:30,927
I'm afraid that wouldn't help.
You might change the name,

194
00:16:31,003 --> 00:16:33,096
but you can't erase the brand.

195
00:16:33,172 --> 00:16:34,764
That's indelible.

196
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:40,278
As long as you continue to live
in this place, you're in danger.

197
00:16:40,346 --> 00:16:42,974
You're speaking in riddles,
Herr Inspector.

198
00:16:43,049 --> 00:16:46,416
Danger from whom?
The Burgomeister
and his inhospitable villagers?

199
00:16:46,485 --> 00:16:51,718
Oh, I think I can guarantee to control
their animosity, but not their fears.

200
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:54,089
What are they afraid of, ghosts?

201
00:16:56,462 --> 00:16:58,896
Perhaps.

202
00:16:58,964 --> 00:17:01,524
I'm afraid I don't believe in them.
Do you?

203
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,899
When they commit murder, yes.

204
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:07,336
Oh.

205
00:17:07,406 --> 00:17:10,569
You're referring to the monster.
Perhaps.

206
00:17:10,643 --> 00:17:13,373
My dear Inspector,
he was destroyed years ago.

207
00:17:16,615 --> 00:17:18,048
Perhaps.

208
00:17:20,052 --> 00:17:23,180
Can we stick to facts, Inspector?

209
00:17:23,255 --> 00:17:26,053
That my father instilled life
into a dead man is perfectly true,

210
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:28,059
but I'm also convinced
that the stories of this creature...

211
00:17:28,127 --> 00:17:32,655
have been so greatly exaggerated
in the telling and the retelling...

212
00:17:32,732 --> 00:17:35,599
that the simple folk
of the neighborhood
now believe him to have been...

213
00:17:35,668 --> 00:17:39,160
the most fiendish monster
that ever walked this earth.

214
00:17:39,238 --> 00:17:42,401
Do you honestly know of one criminal
act that this poor creature committed?

<i>[Thunderclap]</i>

216
00:17:44,477 --> 00:17:46,274
Did you ever even see him?

217
00:17:47,847 --> 00:17:50,782
The most vivid recollection
of my life.

218
00:17:53,452 --> 00:17:58,321
I was but a child at the time,
about the age of your own son.

219
00:17:59,925 --> 00:18:03,520
The monster had escaped
and was ravaging the countryside...

220
00:18:03,596 --> 00:18:07,032
killing, maiming, terrorizing.

221
00:18:09,201 --> 00:18:12,432
One night he burst into our house.

222
00:18:12,505 --> 00:18:15,303
My father took a gun
and fired at him,

223
00:18:15,374 --> 00:18:19,140
but the savage brute
sent him crashing to a corner.

224
00:18:19,211 --> 00:18:22,647
Then he grabbed me by the arm.

225
00:18:27,153 --> 00:18:29,587
One does not easily forget,
Herr Baron,

226
00:18:29,655 --> 00:18:32,590
an arm torn out by the roots.

227
00:18:33,659 --> 00:18:35,593
No, l...

228
00:18:35,661 --> 00:18:39,222
My lifelong ambition
was to have been a soldier.

229
00:18:39,298 --> 00:18:43,325
But for this, I, who command
seven gendarmes...

230
00:18:43,402 --> 00:18:46,269
in a little mountain village...

231
00:18:46,338 --> 00:18:48,772
might have been a general.

232
00:18:58,851 --> 00:19:03,049
I wish I could do something to...

233
00:19:03,122 --> 00:19:05,113
Won't you change your mind for brandy?

234
00:19:05,191 --> 00:19:07,125
Thank you, Baron.

235
00:19:08,127 --> 00:19:11,221
I apologize
if I've aroused your sympathy,

236
00:19:11,297 --> 00:19:14,562
but I have found that
by explaining my affliction,

237
00:19:14,633 --> 00:19:18,569
it ceases to be quite
such a curiosity.

238
00:19:21,073 --> 00:19:23,507
You intimated that there have been
other murders...

239
00:19:23,576 --> 00:19:26,340
committed since
the destruction of the...

240
00:19:26,412 --> 00:19:28,812
My father's work.
Yes.

241
00:19:28,881 --> 00:19:31,941
And you'll account for it.
But I can't.

242
00:19:32,017 --> 00:19:33,951
Now they get the special agents
imported for the purpose...

243
00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:36,988
from Scotland Yard
and the <i>Suerete Francais.</i>

244
00:19:37,056 --> 00:19:40,253
There have been six, all unsolved,

245
00:19:40,326 --> 00:19:42,851
and all men of some prominence
in the village.

246
00:19:42,928 --> 00:19:45,294
In each case the autopsy disclosed
that death had been caused...

247
00:19:45,364 --> 00:19:47,127
by a violent concussion.

248
00:19:47,199 --> 00:19:49,929
There were no marks on the bodies,
except a slight discoloration...

249
00:19:50,002 --> 00:19:53,369
or bruise at the base of the brain.

250
00:19:53,439 --> 00:19:56,704
But the hearts of all the victims
were ruptured.

251
00:19:56,775 --> 00:20:00,211
In fact, they had burst.

252
00:20:03,983 --> 00:20:07,510
Hence the local superstition
of the murdering ghost.

253
00:20:07,586 --> 00:20:13,149
Need I add that it is always
alluded to as Frankenstein?

254
00:20:13,225 --> 00:20:15,819
Now it's rumored that you,
like your father, are a scientist,

255
00:20:15,895 --> 00:20:18,693
and the villagers saw
the many strange instruments
that preceded you here.

256
00:20:18,764 --> 00:20:21,699
That's why I've come to warn you.

257
00:20:22,768 --> 00:20:25,601
Inspector Krogh,
I should indeed seem ungrateful...

258
00:20:25,671 --> 00:20:28,640
if I were not to thank you
for your interest in my welfare,

259
00:20:28,707 --> 00:20:31,574
but I can assure you I am not engaged
in any black magic,

260
00:20:31,644 --> 00:20:33,942
nor in the creation of monsters,

261
00:20:34,013 --> 00:20:36,106
however the villagers may think.

262
00:20:36,181 --> 00:20:40,379
Nevertheless, Herr Baron,
I stand ready when you need help.

263
00:20:40,452 --> 00:20:41,544
I shall not need it.

264
00:20:42,721 --> 00:20:46,521
When you need help, you have but
to ring the alarm bell in the tower...

265
00:20:46,592 --> 00:20:49,288
and I shall hear it
wherever I may be...

266
00:20:49,361 --> 00:20:50,828
and hasten to your assistance.

Good night, Herr Baron.
Good night and thank you,

Oh, darling, this is Inspector Krogh

It's very good of you, Inspector.
Perhaps you'll honor us soon at dinner.

Wasn't he odd?

Yes. He said if the villagers
bothered us, he'd take a hand.

We seem to be rather
undesirable characters.

My father drew that very lightning

00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:46,631
Good-bye, Peter.
Good-bye.

311
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:54,543
What's that weird-looking structure
across the ravine?

312
00:23:54,613 --> 00:23:56,103
That's my father's laboratory.

313
00:23:56,181 --> 00:24:00,311
<i>They blew the roof off</i>
<i>when the monster was destroyed.</i>

314
00:24:00,385 --> 00:24:03,320
I can't wait to see inside it.

315
00:25:13,425 --> 00:25:14,517
Sulphur.

316
00:25:31,343 --> 00:25:33,834
Hey, you, come down here!

317
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,154
<i>Come on, come on.</i>
<i>Hurry up.!</i>

318
00:25:50,095 --> 00:25:52,029
Come on, get up.

319
00:25:53,632 --> 00:25:55,964
Why did you try to kill me?

320
00:25:56,034 --> 00:26:00,232
I thought you came here
to kill me.
That's a fine story.

321
00:26:00,305 --> 00:26:02,273
It's all right for you people
to hate me,

322
00:26:02,341 --> 00:26:04,275
but attempted murder is another thing.

323
00:26:04,343 --> 00:26:05,435
Who are you?

324
00:26:06,345 --> 00:26:09,576
My name is Ygor.

325
00:26:09,648 --> 00:26:11,639
Let me go, Frankenstein.

326
00:26:11,717 --> 00:26:13,981
I'm gonna turn you over
to Inspector Krogh.

327
00:26:14,052 --> 00:26:15,542
No!

328
00:26:16,788 --> 00:26:19,416
Not give me to Krogh.
Why?

329
00:26:19,491 --> 00:26:23,120
Krogh not want dead man.
Ygor is dead.

330
00:26:23,195 --> 00:26:24,628
What are you talking about?

331
00:26:26,198 --> 00:26:28,189
You see that?

332
00:26:28,267 --> 00:26:31,566
They hanged me once, Frankenstein.

333
00:26:31,637 --> 00:26:33,571
They broke my neck.

334
00:26:35,474 --> 00:26:38,136
They said I was dead.

335
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:40,838
Then they cut me down.

336
00:26:40,913 --> 00:26:42,847
Hanged you?

337
00:26:45,183 --> 00:26:49,916
- Why did they hang you?
- Because I stole bodies,

338
00:26:49,988 --> 00:26:51,353
they said.

339
00:26:51,423 --> 00:26:53,687
Yes.
What are you doing here?

340
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:57,126
They threw me in here long ago.

341
00:26:58,196 --> 00:27:03,395
They wouldn't bury me
in holy place like churchyard...

342
00:27:03,468 --> 00:27:06,460
because I stole bodies,

343
00:27:06,538 --> 00:27:08,301
they said.

344
00:27:08,373 --> 00:27:13,606
So... Ygor is dead!
[Laughs]

345
00:27:15,547 --> 00:27:18,141
You...

346
00:27:18,216 --> 00:27:23,347
Dr. Frankenstein,
like your father, eh?

347
00:27:23,422 --> 00:27:27,358
Yes, but I can't mend a broken neck.

348
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:32,196
Nobody can mend Ygor's neck.

349
00:27:32,264 --> 00:27:34,698
It's all right.

350
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:41,298
So you doctor?

351
00:27:41,373 --> 00:27:44,467
Yes, I'm a doctor,
amongst other things.

352
00:27:45,544 --> 00:27:47,478
You come with me.

353
00:28:58,984 --> 00:29:00,918
My grandfather.

354
00:29:16,034 --> 00:29:17,626
<i>My father.</i>

355
00:29:23,875 --> 00:29:25,968
Is this what you wanted
to show me?

356
00:30:04,182 --> 00:30:06,116
He's alive!

357
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:13,021
How long has he been here?

358
00:30:13,091 --> 00:30:15,525
Long time.

359
00:30:15,594 --> 00:30:18,495
He is my friend.

360
00:30:20,866 --> 00:30:24,358
He does things for me.

361
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:29,468
Has he always been here?
<i>Nearly always.</i>

362
00:30:29,541 --> 00:30:33,136
This is place of the dead.

363
00:30:33,879 --> 00:30:36,746
We all dead here.

364
00:30:36,815 --> 00:30:41,309
But he's not dead.
No, not dead.

365
00:30:41,386 --> 00:30:42,717
Asleep.

366
00:30:43,788 --> 00:30:45,881
<i>Sick.</i>

367
00:30:45,957 --> 00:30:49,154
<i>He has been so many months.</i>

368
00:30:49,227 --> 00:30:52,526
What happened?
Did you...

369
00:30:52,597 --> 00:30:54,758
Oh, no.

370
00:30:54,833 --> 00:30:58,792
It happened one night
when he was outside.

371
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:00,167
Outside?

372
00:31:00,238 --> 00:31:03,605
Yes. He was...

373
00:31:03,675 --> 00:31:05,836
hunting.

374
00:31:06,912 --> 00:31:09,938
There was a great storm.

375
00:31:10,015 --> 00:31:12,779
He was standing under tree...

376
00:31:12,851 --> 00:31:14,842
when...

377
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:18,048
lightning strike!

378
00:31:18,123 --> 00:31:23,527
How did he get in here?
I find him and bring him home.

379
00:31:23,595 --> 00:31:26,758
But he walks no more.

380
00:31:26,831 --> 00:31:30,289
Evidence of trauma,

381
00:31:30,368 --> 00:31:32,302
exactly the same
as a human being.

382
00:31:33,471 --> 00:31:36,269
<i>But he is supposed to</i>
<i>have been destroyed.</i>
<i>No.</i>

383
00:31:36,341 --> 00:31:41,210
He cannot be destroyed.
Cannot die.

384
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:46,216
Your father made him live
for always.

385
00:31:48,086 --> 00:31:50,350
Now, he is sick.

386
00:31:50,422 --> 00:31:53,050
Make him well, Frankenstein.

387
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:58,518
- I don't know whether l...
- Your father made him.

388
00:31:59,598 --> 00:32:03,728
And Heinrich Frankenstein
was your father too.

389
00:32:03,802 --> 00:32:08,637
Do you mean to imply, then, that
that is my brother?

390
00:32:11,343 --> 00:32:15,302
But his mother was lightning.

391
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:21,012
Oh. Electricity. We'll see.

392
00:32:21,086 --> 00:32:23,316
I'll get my instruments from the castle.
We'll take him up there.

393
00:32:23,388 --> 00:32:27,984
No! You cannot take him away.

394
00:32:31,429 --> 00:32:34,921
Just up there
in the old laboratory,

395
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,093
where I have light and room.

396
00:32:37,168 --> 00:32:39,500
Please. You understand.

397
00:32:39,571 --> 00:32:44,133
No one must see him,
Frankenstein.

398
00:32:44,209 --> 00:32:46,302
But does anyone know
that he's here?

399
00:32:47,979 --> 00:32:52,006
Good. Good.

400
00:32:59,991 --> 00:33:03,825
No one will know
that he is here until...

401
00:33:03,895 --> 00:33:08,195
until your creation, Father,
walks again.

402
00:33:33,591 --> 00:33:36,059
What's going on
at Castle Frankenstein?

403
00:33:36,127 --> 00:33:38,687
The whole village is alarmed
with anxiety.

404
00:33:38,763 --> 00:33:41,357
My men report
nothing but quiet.
Quiet?

405
00:33:41,433 --> 00:33:45,836
There's nothing so ominous as quiet.
Besides, it isn't quiet.

406
00:33:45,904 --> 00:33:49,863
From the cemetery on Crag Hill,
Hans Stenble can see the castle...

407
00:33:49,941 --> 00:33:51,932
with his field glasses.

408
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:54,979
The servants have been moving
large crates and boxes...

409
00:33:55,046 --> 00:33:56,775
into the old laboratory.

410
00:33:56,848 --> 00:34:00,841
They even have old Ygor
helping them.
Ygor!

411
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:03,888
We Frankensteinians
are as nervous as cats.

412
00:34:03,955 --> 00:34:05,718
We grovel at the howl of a wolf.

413
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:08,190
When the wind slams the door
or a shutter,

414
00:34:08,259 --> 00:34:10,784
we tremble in our shoes and hide
ourselves like frightened rabbits.

415
00:34:10,862 --> 00:34:13,592
And always will with
a Frankenstein in our midst.

416
00:34:13,665 --> 00:34:16,395
What's he doing?
That's all we want to know.

417
00:34:16,468 --> 00:34:19,869
We want to know!
Let's get Ygor here
and make him tell us!

418
00:34:19,938 --> 00:34:21,701
Yes!

419
00:34:21,773 --> 00:34:24,105
Yes.

420
00:34:24,175 --> 00:34:25,540
Yes!

421
00:34:48,767 --> 00:34:50,428
All right, Ygor, make it fast.

422
00:34:53,705 --> 00:34:55,502
Ready?

423
00:34:55,573 --> 00:34:57,006
<i>Ready.!</i>

424
00:36:26,397 --> 00:36:27,329
No!

425
00:36:27,398 --> 00:36:29,093
What's the matter with you?
What are you doing?

426
00:36:30,168 --> 00:36:33,137
He cannot come in here!
No one!

427
00:36:33,204 --> 00:36:37,265
No? You want me to make him well?
Very well then. I need some help.

428
00:36:37,342 --> 00:36:39,936
This man is not just my servant.
He's been with me for years,

429
00:36:40,011 --> 00:36:41,945
helping me with my experiments.

430
00:36:42,013 --> 00:36:44,174
I need him now to make notes.

431
00:36:44,249 --> 00:36:46,683
Oh, all right,
I'll not make him well.

432
00:36:51,356 --> 00:36:53,415
But if he tells...

433
00:37:01,466 --> 00:37:03,900
All right, come along, Benson.

434
00:37:19,884 --> 00:37:21,784
<i>Get your notes, Benson.</i>

435
00:37:27,959 --> 00:37:32,328
Iris contracted.
Marked sclerectasia.

436
00:37:32,397 --> 00:37:34,228
Mental abnormality.

437
00:37:36,668 --> 00:37:38,659
Considerable osteodermia
in the frontal region.

438
00:37:39,837 --> 00:37:43,432
<i>Apparently these are</i>
<i>the exterior electrodes,</i>

439
00:37:43,508 --> 00:37:47,239
the means by which my father inducted
the vital energy into the body.

440
00:37:50,381 --> 00:37:52,315
<i>Systolic pressure, over 300.</i>

441
00:37:54,319 --> 00:37:58,881
Diastolic, over 220...
three times normal.

442
00:37:58,957 --> 00:38:02,120
[Breathing]

443
00:38:08,066 --> 00:38:12,002
Definite hyperpituitary.
Minus 65.

444
00:38:13,905 --> 00:38:15,964
That accounts
for his great size.

445
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:29,784
No human heart could possibly
function like that,

446
00:38:29,854 --> 00:38:31,515
especially in his condition.

447
00:38:32,824 --> 00:38:34,883
<i>It's beating</i>
<i>at over 250 to the minute.</i>

448
00:38:45,136 --> 00:38:47,536
He's completely superhuman.

449
00:39:10,795 --> 00:39:12,729
Get your notes, Benson.

450
00:39:36,354 --> 00:39:38,754
Left ventricular preponderance.

451
00:39:38,823 --> 00:39:41,553
And look at this.

452
00:39:41,626 --> 00:39:43,560
Do you know what those are?
<i>No, sir.</i>

453
00:39:43,628 --> 00:39:48,190
Bullets. Two bullets in his heart.
And he still lives!

454
00:40:02,513 --> 00:40:05,607
<i>I've never seen</i>
<i>blood like that before.</i>

455
00:40:05,683 --> 00:40:09,619
Polymorphocellular.
Extreme hemachrosis.

456
00:40:09,687 --> 00:40:13,714
<i>The alpha leukocytes</i>
<i>apparently do not dissolve.</i>

457
00:40:13,791 --> 00:40:16,282
The entire structure of the blood
is quite different...

458
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,328
from that of the normal human being.

459
00:40:19,464 --> 00:40:22,558
<i>The cells seem to be battling</i>
<i>one another...</i>

460
00:40:22,633 --> 00:40:25,124
<i>as if they had a conscious life</i>
<i>of their own.</i>

461
00:40:26,204 --> 00:40:29,799
What was in those boxes?
All kinds of things. Machines.

462
00:40:29,874 --> 00:40:32,741
What kind of machines?
All kinds.

463
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:34,801
Wheels that turn around.

464
00:40:34,879 --> 00:40:37,074
Electric lightings come out.

465
00:40:37,148 --> 00:40:40,083
Bottles... big ones, little ones.

466
00:40:40,151 --> 00:40:42,517
Medicine... all kinds.

467
00:40:42,587 --> 00:40:45,818
He doctor.
I no understand his business.

468
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:48,916
I am... blacksmith.

469
00:40:48,993 --> 00:40:51,860
Body snatcher, you mean?

470
00:40:51,929 --> 00:40:54,454
Yes!

471
00:40:54,532 --> 00:40:58,992
Has he asked you to rob any graves?
To get him a body?

472
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:00,628
No!

473
00:41:00,705 --> 00:41:03,503
Tell us the truth,
or we'll hang you again...

474
00:41:03,574 --> 00:41:05,599
and make a better job of it
next time.

475
00:41:05,676 --> 00:41:08,907
No, you no can hang me again.
Can they?

476
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:11,881
No, that's been settled.
You were hanged
and pronounced dead.

477
00:41:11,949 --> 00:41:13,883
But he was not dead!

478
00:41:13,951 --> 00:41:16,784
He was pronounced dead
by Dr. Burgher.

479
00:41:16,854 --> 00:41:19,550
And all the others Burgher's pronounced
dead for the last 30 years...

480
00:41:19,624 --> 00:41:22,616
have been dead, haven't they?

481
00:41:22,693 --> 00:41:26,493
If Ygor came to life again,
it's the devil's work, not the court's.

482
00:41:26,564 --> 00:41:30,159
You mean to say that if he commits
another crime, he can't be hanged again?

483
00:41:30,234 --> 00:41:32,964
Well, yes, but...
I do nothing.

484
00:41:33,037 --> 00:41:35,130
I help Frankenstein.

485
00:41:35,206 --> 00:41:37,970
He good man.
He pay me money.

486
00:41:38,042 --> 00:41:39,976
Well, you watch him.

487
00:41:40,044 --> 00:41:43,138
And if he starts to do anything
like his father...

488
00:41:43,214 --> 00:41:46,809
and you don't tell us,
I'll see that you hang again!

489
00:41:47,885 --> 00:41:52,015
You? Alone?
[Laughs]

490
00:41:52,089 --> 00:41:56,992
It took eight men before
to say I was to be hanged.

491
00:41:57,061 --> 00:41:59,086
Well, the same eight
will find you guilty again.

492
00:41:59,163 --> 00:42:00,926
So?

493
00:42:00,998 --> 00:42:03,592
The same eight aren't here, Weber.

494
00:42:03,668 --> 00:42:09,106
No?
Well, I'm one of the eight,
and I'll be one again with pleasure.

495
00:42:09,173 --> 00:42:12,108
You, Neumüller,

496
00:42:13,444 --> 00:42:14,911
you were one.

497
00:42:14,979 --> 00:42:16,537
And I too.

498
00:42:16,614 --> 00:42:21,051
Yes, you, too, Lang.

499
00:42:21,118 --> 00:42:23,746
<i>That's right. I remember.</i>

500
00:42:25,323 --> 00:42:28,224
That's all here now, eh?

501
00:42:28,292 --> 00:42:31,955
Yes. The other six
are all dead.

502
00:42:35,433 --> 00:42:38,197
They die. Dead.

503
00:42:38,269 --> 00:42:40,362
I die. Live.

504
00:42:41,439 --> 00:42:44,738
Quiet! That'll be all, Ygor.

505
00:42:44,809 --> 00:42:47,243
Go back to Castle Frankenstein
and be careful.

506
00:42:47,311 --> 00:42:51,304
[Coughing]

507
00:42:53,584 --> 00:42:55,643
Hey!

508
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:58,120
You spit on me!
I am sorry.

509
00:42:58,189 --> 00:43:02,592
I cough. You see,
bone get stuck in my throat.

510
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:06,289
[Continues Coughing]

511
00:43:14,505 --> 00:43:18,601
The results of my extensive examinations
establish beyond doubt...

512
00:43:18,676 --> 00:43:21,042
that the creature was
brought to life originally...

513
00:43:21,112 --> 00:43:24,946
by an electrical impulse
of terrifying potency.

514
00:43:26,183 --> 00:43:29,880
It appears that my father thought
he could extract from lightning,

515
00:43:29,954 --> 00:43:33,549
some super-violet ray...

516
00:43:33,624 --> 00:43:35,785
of life-giving properties.

517
00:43:36,861 --> 00:43:39,955
From a careful analysis
of his electrical hookup,

518
00:43:41,198 --> 00:43:44,690
I've learned that he actually
attracted cosmic rays,

519
00:43:44,769 --> 00:43:47,636
which neither he nor anyone else
in the world of science at that time...

520
00:43:47,705 --> 00:43:50,265
even knew existed.

521
00:43:50,341 --> 00:43:53,367
Of course, since then,
many of our most profound scientists...

522
00:43:53,444 --> 00:43:57,813
have come to believe that these rays
are actually the source of life itself.

523
00:43:58,683 --> 00:44:01,117
This creature is, indeed, a monster.

524
00:44:05,423 --> 00:44:08,119
There is not one part
of his physical being...

525
00:44:08,192 --> 00:44:10,251
that's like that of human beings.

526
00:44:10,328 --> 00:44:12,762
From his warped brain...

527
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:16,596
down to the tiniest argumentative cell
of his huge carcass,

528
00:44:16,667 --> 00:44:18,259
he's unearthly.

529
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:23,237
Every fantastic story told of him
by the people of Frankenstein...

530
00:44:23,307 --> 00:44:26,743
I now believe to be absolutely true.

531
00:44:28,779 --> 00:44:30,713
I, as a man,

532
00:44:33,985 --> 00:44:36,010
should destroy him.

533
00:44:40,624 --> 00:44:43,354
But as a scientist,

534
00:44:43,427 --> 00:44:46,988
I should do everything in my power
to bring him back to conscious life...

535
00:44:47,064 --> 00:44:51,000
<i>so that the world can study</i>
<i>his abnormal functions.</i>

536
00:44:54,171 --> 00:44:57,106
That would vindicate my father...

537
00:44:57,174 --> 00:44:59,608
and his name would be enshrined
among the immortals.

538
00:45:06,017 --> 00:45:07,951
Benson, turn on the generator.

539
00:45:48,793 --> 00:45:51,227
Stop!
Quiet, you fool!

540
00:46:01,539 --> 00:46:04,099
[Grunting]

541
00:46:08,512 --> 00:46:10,241
[Growls]

542
00:46:12,716 --> 00:46:14,081
[Grunts]

543
00:46:44,915 --> 00:46:48,373
It's no good, Ygor.
I've done everything I can.

544
00:46:48,452 --> 00:46:51,751
I'm afraid we'll never get him
out of this coma.

545
00:46:51,822 --> 00:46:53,756
Come on, Benson.

546
00:46:54,825 --> 00:46:56,759
We'll take off these electrodes.

547
00:46:59,463 --> 00:47:02,398
<i>I'm not going to work</i>
<i>at Castle Frankenstein any longer.</i>

548
00:47:02,466 --> 00:47:06,869
I've seen enough to make me suspicious.
I'm going to quit.

549
00:47:06,937 --> 00:47:11,271
No, you're not. You'll stay and report
to me everything you see and hear.

550
00:47:12,343 --> 00:47:14,834
I'll call there myself
this afternoon.

551
00:47:16,013 --> 00:47:17,947
You'll be well repaid.

552
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:23,682
Now go back and don't tell anyone
you've seen me.

553
00:47:23,754 --> 00:47:25,381
Understand?

554
00:47:25,456 --> 00:47:26,889
Yes, sir.

555
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:31,521
I'd like very much
to visit the village,

556
00:47:31,595 --> 00:47:34,189
but I'm ashamed to say
I don't dare.

557
00:47:34,265 --> 00:47:36,233
I think you are very wise, madam.

558
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,530
There's a definite feeling
of tension there,

559
00:47:38,602 --> 00:47:41,469
and I'm sure you'll be much better off
not to risk...

560
00:47:41,539 --> 00:47:42,972
the discourtesy of the villagers.

561
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:45,338
Yes. That's what Wolf said.

562
00:47:45,409 --> 00:47:48,310
I suspect the baron, too, finds time
heavy on his hands here.

563
00:47:48,379 --> 00:47:51,576
Oh, no, never. He's almost
constantly in his laboratory.

564
00:47:52,816 --> 00:47:56,684
Laboratory?
<i>Yes. He's fixed over</i>
<i>his father's old one, you know?</i>

565
00:47:56,754 --> 00:48:00,121
<i>He's deep in some experiment.</i>

566
00:48:00,191 --> 00:48:02,682
I see. What sort of experiment?

567
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:06,594
I'm sure I don't know.
I never bother him at times like this.

568
00:48:06,664 --> 00:48:08,655
He's terribly preoccupied now,

569
00:48:08,732 --> 00:48:11,792
but as soon as his problem's solved,
he'll be as gay as a lark again.

570
00:48:11,869 --> 00:48:14,633
<i>He's like that.</i>
Is he in his laboratory now?

571
00:48:14,705 --> 00:48:18,072
No. He came in to lunch
looking gray as a ghost.

572
00:48:18,142 --> 00:48:22,476
I could see he was on pins and needles,
so I suggested he get some air.

573
00:48:22,546 --> 00:48:26,277
<i>He's been gone for hours.</i>
<i>You don't mind</i>
<i>being left alone here?</i>

574
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:28,944
<i>Well, not in the daytime,</i>
<i>but at night</i>...

575
00:48:29,019 --> 00:48:30,281
Good afternoon, Inspector.

576
00:48:30,354 --> 00:48:32,288
Good afternoon, Herr Baron.

577
00:48:34,225 --> 00:48:37,251
I trust you enjoyed
your walk.
Yes, very much.

578
00:48:37,328 --> 00:48:40,229
There's nothing like a good walk through
the woods for clearing one's mind.

579
00:48:41,298 --> 00:48:42,890
Won't you sit down?
Thank you.

580
00:48:42,967 --> 00:48:47,461
Yes, you scientists must to have
clear minds and steady nerves.

581
00:48:47,538 --> 00:48:51,474
The baroness has just been telling me
that you're knee-deep in experiments.

582
00:48:51,542 --> 00:48:54,477
- Yes.
- And working in your father's old lab?

583
00:48:54,545 --> 00:48:58,140
<i>Hmm. The villagers call it</i>
<i>"the monster's home."</i>

584
00:48:58,215 --> 00:49:00,775
Haven't seen him stalking about
by any chance, have you?

585
00:49:00,851 --> 00:49:03,012
No. L...

586
00:49:03,087 --> 00:49:05,282
I fear he'll never stalk again.

587
00:49:05,356 --> 00:49:06,846
<i>That's a relief.</i>

588
00:49:06,924 --> 00:49:09,654
But I'm curious to know
why you chose that place to work?

589
00:49:09,727 --> 00:49:12,457
It was my father's.
<i>But without a roof?</i>

590
00:49:12,529 --> 00:49:14,827
I sealed it up
with some heavy canvas.

591
00:49:14,898 --> 00:49:17,696
Does the sulphur fumes
bother you?

592
00:49:17,768 --> 00:49:19,167
<i>No, no, no, not at all.</i>

593
00:49:19,236 --> 00:49:20,897
Sulphur fumes?

594
00:49:20,971 --> 00:49:23,098
Forgive me, Baron.
Perhaps I shouldn't
have mentioned that.

595
00:49:23,173 --> 00:49:25,334
I thought madam knew.
Tell me.

596
00:49:25,409 --> 00:49:28,071
Well, you see, darling,
our family history states...

597
00:49:28,145 --> 00:49:30,272
that the structure
was built by the Romans...

598
00:49:30,347 --> 00:49:33,441
over a natural sulphur pit
and used by them as mineral baths.

599
00:49:33,517 --> 00:49:35,781
One of the first
health resorts, perhaps.

600
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:39,787
Health resort.
[Chuckles]

601
00:49:40,658 --> 00:49:42,649
Yes, possibly.

602
00:49:42,726 --> 00:49:46,594
But during the succeeding centuries,
the sulphur increased in intensity...

603
00:49:46,664 --> 00:49:50,031
until now, I believe,
it is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit.

604
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:51,897
Exactly.
Even the stoutest
Roman...

605
00:49:51,969 --> 00:49:55,097
couldn't venture into that today
without being parboiled to the bone...

606
00:49:55,172 --> 00:49:57,299
in just a few moments.

607
00:49:57,374 --> 00:50:01,037
Wolf, you do pick
the strangest places.

608
00:50:01,111 --> 00:50:02,874
I'd like to see how
you fixed it up.

609
00:50:04,581 --> 00:50:07,482
I'll have you come there some time...
and parboil you.

610
00:50:09,453 --> 00:50:11,921
[Both Chuckling]

611
00:50:18,195 --> 00:50:20,959
Well, hello!

612
00:50:21,031 --> 00:50:23,090
<i>Mother, may I come in?</i>

613
00:50:23,167 --> 00:50:24,828
Come on in, son.

614
00:50:24,902 --> 00:50:28,065
Peter, this is Inspector Krogh.
How do you do?

615
00:50:28,138 --> 00:50:29,537
How do you do, sir?

616
00:50:29,606 --> 00:50:33,406
You're not supposed to shake hands
with our left hands.
<i>[Elsa] Peter.!</i>

617
00:50:33,477 --> 00:50:36,207
I'm sorry.
That was very rude of me.

618
00:50:37,481 --> 00:50:39,949
You're not supposed to wear
gloves in the house, either.

619
00:50:40,017 --> 00:50:41,609
<i>[Baron]</i>
<i>Son.!</i>
Sorry about that too.

620
00:50:41,685 --> 00:50:44,586
But I only have one real arm.
This one isn't mine.

621
00:50:44,655 --> 00:50:45,917
Well, whose is it?

622
00:50:47,091 --> 00:50:49,082
It...
<i>You see,</i>

623
00:50:49,159 --> 00:50:52,560
Inspector Krogh lost
his other real arm...

01:06:50,219 --> 01:06:53,086
Wolf, couldn't we install
an old-fashioned doorbell?

784
01:06:53,156 --> 01:06:55,556
That boom almost makes me
jump out of my skin.

785
01:06:55,625 --> 01:06:57,115
Yes, dear,
I'll have a bell put in.

786
01:06:57,193 --> 01:07:01,027
That knocker must've been used in the
old days to arouse the entire household.

787
01:07:01,097 --> 01:07:05,534
A sort of call to arms
in times of danger.

788
01:07:07,737 --> 01:07:09,637
It's one of your men, Inspector.

789
01:07:09,706 --> 01:07:11,731
There has been an accident
in the village.

790
01:07:11,808 --> 01:07:13,571
<i>A sudden death.</i>

791
01:07:13,643 --> 01:07:16,373
<i>He requested that</i>
<i>you come at once.</i>

792
01:07:16,446 --> 01:07:18,437
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

793
01:07:18,514 --> 01:07:20,448
Please excuse me.

794
01:07:20,516 --> 01:07:24,850
What a shame to leave a delicious dinner
like this for so sordid a thing as...

795
01:07:24,921 --> 01:07:27,481
I trust that nothing has happened
to your butler, madam.

796
01:07:27,557 --> 01:07:29,650
Thank you.
Good night.

797
01:07:29,726 --> 01:07:31,159
Baron.

798
01:07:41,204 --> 01:07:45,231
I really think you should
try and find Benson.
I'm worried about him.

799
01:07:45,308 --> 01:07:47,708
Yes, I will.
But don't go alone.

800
01:07:47,777 --> 01:07:49,711
Silly. I'll be all right.

801
01:07:52,548 --> 01:07:54,812
[Laughing]

802
01:08:06,629 --> 01:08:08,893
What's the matter with him?
He's asleep.

803
01:08:10,666 --> 01:08:13,100
Have you seen Benson?
Yes.

804
01:08:13,169 --> 01:08:15,399
When?
About two hours ago.

805
01:08:15,471 --> 01:08:17,268
Where?
Here.

806
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:20,901
He say you tell him
monster walk again.

807
01:08:20,977 --> 01:08:22,569
He came to see.

808
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:25,877
Monster walk.

809
01:08:25,948 --> 01:08:28,007
Benson run, run, run.

810
01:08:28,084 --> 01:08:30,575
Where did he run to?
He isn't at the castle.

811
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:34,346
He just run away
in the woods.

812
01:08:35,425 --> 01:08:38,053
That thing's enough
to scare anyone.

813
01:08:39,128 --> 01:08:41,119
I didn't think Benson
would come here.

814
01:08:43,065 --> 01:08:45,625
Are you telling me the truth?
You didn't kill him?

815
01:08:45,701 --> 01:08:48,363
No, no, no!

816
01:08:48,438 --> 01:08:50,838
Why, I scare him to death.

817
01:08:50,907 --> 01:08:53,137
I don't have to kill him to death.

818
01:08:53,209 --> 01:08:56,110
[Grunting]

819
01:09:05,021 --> 01:09:07,990
Where does the ladder
into the sulphur pit lead to?

820
01:09:09,392 --> 01:09:11,121
A cave.

821
01:09:11,194 --> 01:09:12,661
A cave?

822
01:09:12,728 --> 01:09:15,458
It's warm.
We stay there in winter.

823
01:09:15,531 --> 01:09:18,989
Oh. Where does
the cave lead to?

824
01:09:19,068 --> 01:09:20,660
Just cave.

825
01:09:24,207 --> 01:09:25,936
[Grunts]

826
01:09:40,723 --> 01:09:42,953
My deepest sympathies,
Frau Neumüller.

827
01:09:44,093 --> 01:09:45,560
How did it happen?

828
01:09:45,628 --> 01:09:47,858
He must have been asleep
and fallen off his wagon.

829
01:09:47,930 --> 01:09:51,764
The wheels passed over his legs breaking
both of them and crushing his chest.

830
01:09:51,834 --> 01:09:53,426
See here?

831
01:09:54,804 --> 01:09:58,740
Will you all leave while Dr. Burgher
and I make out the death certificates?

832
01:10:12,555 --> 01:10:15,149
Any other marks or bruises?

833
01:10:15,224 --> 01:10:17,158
Examine the back of the neck.

834
01:10:19,829 --> 01:10:22,263
You don't think that...
Perhaps.

835
01:10:22,331 --> 01:10:24,697
We won't know until
you perform an autopsy.

836
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:27,964
Examine the heart,
and report to me at once.

837
01:10:49,959 --> 01:10:52,223
Wolf.

838
01:10:52,295 --> 01:10:54,320
What happened to Benson?

839
01:10:54,397 --> 01:10:56,331
I don't know, really, dear.

840
01:10:57,333 --> 01:10:59,733
I've been working him
pretty hard lately.

841
01:10:59,802 --> 01:11:01,963
Maybe he just wanted to
go out and get drunk.

842
01:11:02,038 --> 01:11:03,835
But Benson doesn't drink.

843
01:11:03,906 --> 01:11:06,306
Well, perhaps he does sometimes.

844
01:11:06,375 --> 01:11:08,866
<i>He'll be back in the morning</i>
<i>bright and early. You'll see.</i>

01:11:08,945 --> 01:11:10,640
<i>Don't worry about him.</i>

846
01:11:10,713 --> 01:11:12,840
It's you I'm worried about.

847
01:11:12,915 --> 01:11:14,644
You aren't yourself.

848
01:11:14,717 --> 01:11:17,083
Are you keeping something
from me?

849
01:11:21,757 --> 01:11:23,349
No, darling.

850
01:11:24,493 --> 01:11:26,654
Is this place getting
on your nerves?

851
01:11:27,663 --> 01:11:29,961
I hate it here, Wolf.

852
01:11:30,032 --> 01:11:32,000
I'm terribly afraid all the time.

853
01:11:32,068 --> 01:11:36,937
I'm sorry, dear. I'm going to send
you and Peter away in the morning.

854
01:11:37,006 --> 01:11:40,942
I want you to take a trip to Brussels
and I'll follow you in a few days.

855
01:11:41,010 --> 01:11:43,604
I've tried so desperately
to match your bravery, but...

856
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:45,271
Oh, my dear!

857
01:11:51,187 --> 01:11:53,121
I'll be all right.

858
01:11:54,824 --> 01:11:56,485
That's a good girl.

859
01:12:00,696 --> 01:12:03,096
Where are you going?
To get Peter.

860
01:12:03,165 --> 01:12:06,100
I'll feel better having him
in here with me.

861

No, no!

<i>[Bell Ringing, Men Yelling]</i>

863
01:14:04,186 --> 01:14:07,280
Good morning, Inspector.
You're up rather early, aren't you?

864
01:14:07,356 --> 01:14:08,880
You're early yourself,
Baron.

865
01:14:08,958 --> 01:14:10,983
I came to inquire
about your butler.

866
01:14:11,060 --> 01:14:13,688
Have you found him,
dead or alive?

867
01:14:13,763 --> 01:14:18,564
No, no, but he'll be back.
He's done this sort of thing before.

868
01:14:18,634 --> 01:14:20,795
<i>These sudden disappearances.</i>
<i>Oh, can I give you a light?</i>

869
01:14:20,870 --> 01:14:22,895
Thank you. No.

870
01:14:24,106 --> 01:14:27,303
He was in the war, you know.
He was wounded in the head.

871
01:14:27,376 --> 01:14:30,539
It makes him, well,
rather funny at times.

872
01:14:30,613 --> 01:14:33,343
But don't worry about him.
I'm just going down to the village.

873
01:14:33,415 --> 01:14:36,612
Will you come along with me?
The village?
There's not a shop open.

874
01:14:36,685 --> 01:14:39,518
No, no, I'm going to
the railroad station.

875
01:14:39,588 --> 01:14:42,921
My wife and child are going away...

876
01:14:42,992 --> 01:14:45,756
for a slight holiday.

877
01:14:45,828 --> 01:14:48,956
So?
Yes, yes.

878
01:14:49,031 --> 01:14:52,694
So, you see, I have to do
all the arranging myself,

879
01:14:52,768 --> 01:14:54,429
now that that stupid Benson's gone.

880
01:14:54,503 --> 01:14:56,801
I am afraid I must ask you
not to go, Baron.

881
01:14:56,872 --> 01:14:59,340
Neither you nor your wife or child.

882
01:15:00,476 --> 01:15:04,105
That accidental death that called me
from your dinner last night...

883
01:15:04,180 --> 01:15:06,171
was another burst heart.

<i>He's been playing that thing</i>
<i>all night.</i>

There's a mob at your gate.

887
01:15:30,806 --> 01:15:34,435
They have a strange notion
that you had something to do with it.

01:15:35,277 --> 01:15:37,211
Silly, isn't it?

889
01:15:38,447 --> 01:15:42,144
Silly? They're mad.
I'll go down there and tell them so.

890
01:15:42,218 --> 01:15:44,584
No, you won't go, Baron.
Why?

891
01:15:44,653 --> 01:15:47,486
We'll talk it over...

892
01:15:47,556 --> 01:15:48,488
inside.

Inspector!
Madam.

895
01:16:05,507 --> 01:16:08,567
My dear, I assume from
the inspector's attitude...

896
01:16:08,644 --> 01:16:11,169
and pointed implications
that I am under arrest.

897
01:16:11,247 --> 01:16:14,239
Arrest?
It appears we've returned
to the Middle Ages.

898
01:16:14,316 --> 01:16:18,582
The villagers have laid siege to the
castle and are crying out for blood.

899
01:16:18,654 --> 01:16:20,713
Madam, l...
A man is murdered a mile away,

900

and do you know what killed him?

901
01:16:22,791 --> 01:16:26,727
My name. The very name of
Frankenstein burst his heart.

902
01:16:26,795 --> 01:16:29,958
And now the happy little villagers
are clamoring for my blood!

903
01:16:30,032 --> 01:16:32,933
I'm afraid the baron is in
a humorous mood this morning.

904
01:16:33,002 --> 01:16:37,166
I suppose it has its humorous side,
but you're not under arrest, madam.

905
01:16:37,239 --> 01:16:40,800
I'm merely here to guarantee you
protection from any unprovoked assault.

906
01:16:40,876 --> 01:16:44,437
Unprovoked assault!
Wolf!

907
01:16:44,513 --> 01:16:48,074
Inspector, you mean it isn't safe
for us to leave?

908
01:16:48,150 --> 01:16:49,981
I'm afraid not, madam.

909
01:16:50,052 --> 01:16:53,886
But is there any reason why you
shouldn't be perfectly safe here?

910

If one simpleminded villager as much
as sets foot inside that door,

01:16:57,159 --> 01:16:58,717
I'll shoot him like a dog!

912
01:16:58,794 --> 01:17:01,854
You can tell them that for me. As long
as you won't allow me to tell them.

01:17:01,931 --> 01:17:04,764
Wolf!
I've never seen him so violent.

Madam, last night I missed
my dinner,

915

and this morning
I've had no breakfast.

01:17:11,607 --> 01:17:14,167
Certainly.
I'll order some at once.

Herr Baron, shall we go

01:18:33,055 --> 01:18:35,717
Oh, no. He doesn't come
through the door.

939
01:18:35,791 --> 01:18:38,351
No? Where does he come in?
Through the window?

940
01:18:38,427 --> 01:18:41,055
<i>Through the fireplace?</i>
Through the wall.

941
01:18:41,130 --> 01:18:42,688
Through the wall?

942
01:18:42,765 --> 01:18:45,393
<i>Where?</i>
Over there.

943
01:18:45,467 --> 01:18:48,129
Huh.

944
01:18:48,203 --> 01:18:50,137
That's very interesting.

945
01:18:52,541 --> 01:18:54,634
You're not afraid of him at all,
are you, Peter?

946
01:18:54,710 --> 01:18:57,804
Oh, no. He's a nice giant.
He give me a watch.

947
01:18:57,880 --> 01:18:59,745
A watch?
<i>Yes.</i>

948
01:18:59,815 --> 01:19:02,215
<i>Would you like to see it?</i>
Very much.

949
01:19:09,291 --> 01:19:10,815
Thank you.

950
01:19:11,894 --> 01:19:15,830
Yes, it's a very nice watch.
A very nice...

951
01:19:19,034 --> 01:19:20,626
nice watch.

952
01:19:24,239 --> 01:19:28,767
Well, Peter, shall we go downstairs
and have some nice hot chocolate?

953
01:19:28,844 --> 01:19:30,436
<i>Yes.!</i>

954
01:19:30,512 --> 01:19:34,004
If the general
will come with me.
I'll be very pleased, sir.

955
01:19:34,083 --> 01:19:35,550
Here we go.

956
01:19:42,724 --> 01:19:45,625
Hurry up.
All right, I'm coming.

957
01:19:45,694 --> 01:19:48,026
Superstitious, blundering idiot!

958
01:19:48,097 --> 01:19:51,362
Prying, insinuating, accusing.
I'll kick him out of the house!

959
01:19:51,433 --> 01:19:55,062
I'll not be heckled by a stupid,
intolerable policeman!

960
01:19:55,137 --> 01:20:00,006
Wolf, the way you're carrying on,
if I were a policeman,
I'd be suspicious myself.

961
01:20:01,076 --> 01:20:02,771
You would?
Yes, I would.

962
01:20:02,845 --> 01:20:04,779
Mysterious things have happened.

963
01:20:04,847 --> 01:20:09,250
A murder in the village, our own
dear Benson disappears for no reason.

964
01:20:09,318 --> 01:20:13,345
They probably think you, like your father,
have created another monster or...

965
01:20:16,425 --> 01:20:19,883
Why, he's got even you, my own wife,
believing that l...

966
01:20:19,962 --> 01:20:22,760
I believe nothing.
I don't care about Krogh.

967
01:20:22,831 --> 01:20:26,164
But I'm afraid for you,
for Peter.

968
01:20:26,235 --> 01:20:28,396
And only you, Wolf,
can restore my confidence.

969
01:20:28,470 --> 01:20:32,497
Oh, please, darling, Elsa,
please have faith in me!

970
01:20:32,574 --> 01:20:34,701
I'm sorry that I lost
control of myself.

971
01:20:34,776 --> 01:20:37,768
I've no reason for being
nervous like this.

972
01:20:37,846 --> 01:20:40,440
But I've been working too hard.

973
01:20:40,516 --> 01:20:44,111
A terrific experiment... one that
I wanted to surprise you with.

974
01:20:44,186 --> 01:20:48,088
One that would establish me
and my... and my work. My work.

975
01:20:48,157 --> 01:20:50,352
It's something outstanding
in the world of science.

976
01:20:50,425 --> 01:20:53,485
But believe me, darling.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

977
01:20:53,562 --> 01:20:56,759
I wouldn't be afraid if I hadn't
for the first time...

978
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:59,027
sensed that you were afraid.

979
01:20:59,101 --> 01:21:01,695
Me? Oh, silly.

980
01:21:01,770 --> 01:21:03,704
Everything's under control.

981
01:21:03,772 --> 01:21:05,865
I'll not lose my temper again.
You'll see.

I'm sorry, young man. I shan't

Krantz, remain here on guard.

01:21:42,077 --> 01:21:44,944
Now I can go to the lab.
I mean, I must go to the lab.

989
01:21:45,013 --> 01:21:46,640
Only for a minute, dear.

990
01:21:46,715 --> 01:21:48,979
I won't be long, really.

991
01:22:20,048 --> 01:22:22,414
No touch him, Frankenstein!

992
01:22:22,484 --> 01:22:23,917
No touch him...

993
01:22:23,986 --> 01:22:27,547
or something happens to you
worse than dying.

994
01:22:27,623 --> 01:22:29,682
- How long has he been here?
- All night.

<i>You liar.!</i>

996
01:22:30,792 --> 01:22:33,192
He was in the village.
You made him kill Herr Neumüller.

01:22:33,262 --> 01:22:34,524
<i>Yes.!</i>

998
01:22:34,596 --> 01:22:38,032
Why not? Neumüller kills me.

Eight men say Ygor hang.

1000
01:22:41,637 --> 01:22:45,334
Now eight men dead.

All dead!

1002
01:22:46,875 --> 01:22:50,174
You crazy fool! If Krogh
finds him, he'll kill him.

1003
01:22:50,245 --> 01:22:52,145
Then he won't be any good
to either of us.

01:23:23,378 --> 01:23:26,245
The baron's in the library, sir.
The rest of the family are at dinner.

1011
01:23:26,315 --> 01:23:29,478
Good. I've had to send to Bandleheim
for additional police.

1012
01:23:29,551 --> 01:23:32,679
Krantz, you report to Sergeant Schiller
at the lower gate.

1013
01:23:32,754 --> 01:23:34,483
The crowd is becoming
unmanageable.

1014
01:23:34,556 --> 01:23:36,148
Herr Inspector.

1015
01:23:40,962 --> 01:23:44,090
<i>[Knock On Door]</i>
Come in.

1016
01:23:44,166 --> 01:23:47,294
Good evening, Inspector.
I thought I'd see you sooner.

1017
01:23:47,369 --> 01:23:51,135
Sorry. I've been busy.
Very busy indeed for me.

1018
01:23:51,206 --> 01:23:53,572
My job is usually
a rather sleepy one.

1019
01:23:53,642 --> 01:23:55,974
Have a drink?
Thank you. No.

1020
01:23:56,044 --> 01:23:58,740
I'm afraid I shall require
all the wits I've got tonight.

1021
01:24:00,682 --> 01:24:03,116
I've never seen you disturbed
before, Inspector.

1022
01:24:04,419 --> 01:24:06,478
Why, you even forgot
to take off your hat.

1023
01:24:06,555 --> 01:24:08,921
Not forgotten, Herr Baron.

1024
01:24:08,990 --> 01:24:11,788
Merely a matter of form.

1025
01:24:11,860 --> 01:24:15,227
My business tonight is official,
not social.

1026
01:24:15,297 --> 01:24:17,231
Rather a crude custom, I agree,

1027
01:24:17,299 --> 01:24:20,029
but the custom.

1028
01:24:21,403 --> 01:24:24,395
Well, sir, what news
from the front?

1029
01:24:26,174 --> 01:24:28,039
Another death.

1030
01:24:28,110 --> 01:24:29,509
Another inquest.

1031
01:24:30,679 --> 01:24:32,909
When did it occur?
This afternoon?

1032
01:24:32,981 --> 01:24:35,973
No. Some time last night.

1033
01:24:36,051 --> 01:24:38,815
It was only discovered
late this morning.

1034
01:24:38,887 --> 01:24:41,219
Herr Lang this time.

1035
01:24:41,289 --> 01:24:43,587
The village apothecary.

1036
01:24:43,658 --> 01:24:45,922
A very old and dear friend.

1037
01:24:47,028 --> 01:24:48,495
He'll be mourned.

1038
01:24:50,399 --> 01:24:51,388
Too bad.

1039
01:24:51,466 --> 01:24:53,331
Yes, isn't it?

1040
01:24:53,402 --> 01:24:57,361
<i>Herr Lang, eh? Never heard</i>
<i>ofhim before. Oh, well.</i>

1041
01:24:57,439 --> 01:24:59,999
I suppose the villagers will say
I killed him, just the same.

1042
01:25:00,075 --> 01:25:03,511
No, not that you killed him,
but that you know who did.

1043
01:25:06,681 --> 01:25:09,741
Really? But of course
I know who did.

1044
01:25:09,818 --> 01:25:13,049
Haven't you heard?
The monster! Ha ha ha!

1045
01:25:13,121 --> 01:25:15,681
Yes, that's what they think.

1046
01:25:15,757 --> 01:25:19,318
Is it the old legendary monster
of my father's time,

1047
01:25:19,394 --> 01:25:22,090
or am I supposed to have
whipped one up...

1048
01:25:22,164 --> 01:25:24,530
as a housewife whips up an omelet?

1049
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:27,525
I've been here over a month,
you know.

1050
01:25:28,603 --> 01:25:30,764
Your wife and child are in danger.

1051
01:25:30,839 --> 01:25:32,932
So? From what?

1052
01:25:33,008 --> 01:25:36,273
You tried to send them away.
I will tomorrow, in spite of you.

1053
01:25:36,344 --> 01:25:39,905
You forget.
I have my hat on.

1054
01:25:39,981 --> 01:25:43,007
Meaning that I'm under arrest?

1055
01:25:43,084 --> 01:25:45,780
Yes.

1056
01:25:45,854 --> 01:25:48,982
I promised your arrest to the villagers
to keep them quiet...

1057
01:25:49,057 --> 01:25:51,116
for the moment.

1058
01:25:51,193 --> 01:25:53,184
For the murder of Lang
and Neumüller?

1059
01:25:53,261 --> 01:25:56,719
No. For the murder of Benson.

1060
01:25:56,798 --> 01:25:59,358
A technical charge,
for the time being.

1061
01:26:01,670 --> 01:26:04,901
Why don't you search the laboratory?
You have my permission.

1062
01:26:04,973 --> 01:26:08,136
I've searched it already
without your permission...

1063
01:26:08,210 --> 01:26:10,610
<i>with two men the other night.</i>

1064
01:26:10,679 --> 01:26:13,113
<i>We found nothing incriminating...</i>

<i>fit for a giant.</i>

1067
01:26:19,187 --> 01:26:21,587
Yes. Yes, it was my father's.

1068
01:26:21,656 --> 01:26:24,489
I reconstructed it
out of curiosity.

1069
01:26:24,559 --> 01:26:26,493
Why don't you search it again?

1070
01:26:30,332 --> 01:26:34,894
By George, I think I know
who your monster may be.

1071
01:26:34,970 --> 01:26:37,632
Good. Who?

1072
01:26:37,706 --> 01:26:39,230
Old Ygor.

1073
01:26:39,307 --> 01:26:42,208
[Chuckling]
Of course. Why not?

1074
01:26:43,278 --> 01:26:45,974
Everybody wants to hang
old Ygor again,

1075
01:26:46,047 --> 01:26:48,413
yet he has a perfect alibi.

1076
01:26:48,483 --> 01:26:52,442
He was constantly under observation
when every murder was committed.

1077
01:26:52,521 --> 01:26:57,618
It's curious that the entire jury
that hanged him is dead.

1078
01:26:57,692 --> 01:27:00,183
But he was never seen
at the scene of the crime.

1079
01:27:01,263 --> 01:27:04,721
Yet it would be too simple
to hang old Ygor.

1080
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:07,358
Well, I don't trust him!

1081
01:27:07,435 --> 01:27:10,165
I'm gonna find him and
kick him off the estate,

1082
01:27:12,374 --> 01:27:14,308
with your permission.

1083
01:27:16,645 --> 01:27:19,637

01:31:08,576 --> 01:31:10,168
Thank you.

01:31:16,384 --> 01:31:18,318
Come in, come in, come in.

1095
01:31:19,921 --> 01:31:22,981
Did you find Ygor?
Yes, I got rid of him.
Have a drink?

1096
01:31:23,057 --> 01:31:25,685
How did you get rid of him?
I killed him!

1097
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:28,058
He tried to murder me with his hammer,
so I shot him.

1098
01:31:28,129 --> 01:31:30,893
What are you gonna do about it?
Compliment you.

1099
01:31:30,965 --> 01:31:33,490
For it is he who
undoubtedly killed Benson.

1100
01:31:35,470 --> 01:31:39,031
Benson?
He's dead. Murdered.

1101
01:31:39,107 --> 01:31:42,941
I just found his body in
a secret passageway
off the nursery.

1102
01:31:43,011 --> 01:31:44,945
Here's his watch.

1103
01:31:45,013 --> 01:31:47,743
It was in the possession
of your son.

1104
01:31:47,816 --> 01:31:51,411
And here's the bit of chain
that was attached to Benson's vest.

1105
01:31:52,587 --> 01:31:56,853
But Ygor didn't do it. Nor did you.
Nor was it done by any ghost.

1106

<i>There's a monster afoot</i>

<i>He's in your control.</i>

1108
01:32:01,329 --> 01:32:04,127
By heaven, I think you're
a worse fiend than your father.

1109
01:32:04,199 --> 01:32:06,599
<i>Where is this monster?</i>
<i>Where is he?</i>

1110
01:32:06,668 --> 01:32:09,228
<i>I'll stay by your side</i>

1111
01:32:09,304 --> 01:32:12,432
And if you don't,
I'll feed you to the villagers...

1112
01:32:12,507 --> 01:32:15,101
like the Romans fed Christians
to the lions.

1113
01:32:17,078 --> 01:32:19,273
I wouldn't put it past you.

1114
01:32:19,347 --> 01:32:21,838
In the meantime,
will you have a drink?

1115
01:32:21,916 --> 01:32:24,077
Or would you like to play darts?

1116

01:35:55,630 --> 01:35:59,396
Where is Peter?
Where's Peter?
Where is he?

1122
01:35:59,467 --> 01:36:02,027
He's gone!
[Screams]

1123
01:36:02,103 --> 01:36:05,163
<i>Peter.! Peter.!</i>

1124
01:36:05,239 --> 01:36:08,402
What is it?
Peter's gone!

1125
01:36:08,476 --> 01:36:10,410
I'm going to the laboratory!

1126
01:36:50,885 --> 01:36:52,477
Here we are.

1127
01:36:53,754 --> 01:36:57,713

Oh, baby!

Herewith I deed to you the castle
and the estate of Frankenstein.

Do with them what you will.

And may happiness and peace of mind...

Good-bye, Peter.
