We haven't had this much space

It's secure?

This cell block is.

He hates me. He's too good
a man to say it, but I know.

Only one way to
keep you alive...

He's bleeding out.
We gotta go back.

11
00:00:38,137 --> 00:00:40,254
Come around here.
Put pressure on the knee.

12

Hard, hard!
Push, push.

Why don't you come on
out of there? Slow and steady.

What happened to him?

15
00:00:48,731 --> 00:00:50,397
- He got bit.
- Bit?

16
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,399
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy now.

17
00:00:52,401 --> 00:00:54,652
Nobody needs to get hurt.

18
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:56,203
- I need you to hold this.
- Okay.

19

- As hard as you can.
- Yes.

Don't look like no rescue team.

If a rescue team is what
you're waiting for, don't.

26

Come on, we gotta go!

Now! Come on!
I need a hand here.

Get him on the bed.

- Did you cut it off?

- Yeah.
- Maybe you got it in time.

- No, no, no, no.

He's gonna be okay.
He's gonna be okay.

You think you can
stabilize him?

65
00:03:47,807 --> 00:03:50,858
I need to keep his leg elevated.
Get some pillows!

66

He's already bled
through the sheets.

67

We can burn the wound to clot the blood.
I can start a fire.

Today's your

You've been pardoned by the State of Georgia.
You're free to go.

- It ain't none of your concern.

Don't be telling me
what's my concern.

Chill, man.
Dude's leg is messed up.

Besides, we're free now.
Why are we still in here?

- Hey, we ain't leaving.
- You aren't coming in either.

Do not leave his side.

92

If he dies, you need
to be there for that.

93

You think you can do this?

94

How many of you are in there?

100

to a hospital?

One guard looked out for us,
locked us up in the cafeteria.

My kids?
And my old lady?

Yo, you got a cell phone or something
that we can call our families?

125

You just don't get it, do you?

126
00:07:08,296 --> 00:07:11,498
No phones, no computers.

127
00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:17,037
As far as we can see, at leas half

<i>Probably more.</i>

how the hell did you get
in here in the first place?

135
00:08:06,283 --> 00:08:09,385
Cut a hole in that fence
over there by that guard tower.

136
00:08:10,721 --> 00:08:14,325
- That easy, huh?
- Where there's a will there's a way.

137
00:08:14,454 --> 00:08:15,831
Easy for you to say.

138
00:08:18,795 --> 00:08:20,796
So what is this,
like a disease?

139
00:08:20,797 --> 00:08:23,632
Yeah, and we're all infected.

140
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,337
Axel: What do you mean infected?
Like AIDS or something?

141
00:08:28,338 --> 00:08:31,473
Daryl: If I was to kill you,
shoot an arrow in your chest,

142
00:08:31,474 --> 00:08:35,310
you'd come back
as one of these things.

143
00:08:35,311 --> 00:08:37,078
It's gonna happen to all of us.

Must be 50 bodies out here.

147
00:08:48,257 --> 00:08:50,358
Where'd you come from?

148
00:08:50,359 --> 00:08:52,293
Atlanta.

149
00:08:54,428 --> 00:08:56,730
Where are you headed?

150
00:08:56,731 --> 00:08:58,832
For now, nowhere.

151
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,707
I guess you can take that area
down there near the water.

152
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,942
Should be comfortable.

153
00:09:09,943 --> 00:09:11,844
We're using
that field for crops.

154

Slow down, cowboy.

157
00:09:19,186 --> 00:09:22,554
You snatched the locks
off our doors.

158
00:09:22,555 --> 00:09:24,791
We'll give you new locks,
if that's how you want it.

159
00:09:24,792 --> 00:09:27,692
This is our prison.
We were here first.

160
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:29,761
Locked in a broom closet?

161
00:09:30,863 --> 00:09:32,764
We took it, set you free.

162
00:09:32,765 --> 00:09:34,766
It's ours.
We spilled blood.

163
00:09:34,767 --> 00:09:37,936
- We're moving back into our cell block.
- You'll have to get your own.

164
00:09:37,937 --> 00:09:39,637
It is mine. I've still got
personal artifacts in there.

165
00:09:39,638 --> 00:09:41,872
- That's about as mine as it gets.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

166
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:45,475
Maybe let's try to make this
work out so everybody wins.

167
00:09:45,476 --> 00:09:49,980
- I don't see that happening.
- Neither do I.

168
00:09:49,981 --> 00:09:53,684
I ain't going back in that
cafeteria for one more minute.

169
00:09:53,685 --> 00:09:55,752
There are other cell blocks.

170
00:09:55,753 --> 00:09:57,987
You could leave.

171
00:09:57,988 --> 00:09:59,789
Try your luck out on the road.

172
00:10:09,266 --> 00:10:11,534
If these three pussies
can do all this,

173
00:10:11,535 --> 00:10:13,834
the least we can do is take
out another cell block.

174
00:10:13,835 --> 00:10:15,199
With what?

175
00:10:16,206 --> 00:10:18,140
Atlanta here will spot us
some real weapons.

176
00:10:18,141 --> 00:10:21,043
Won't you, boss?

177
00:10:21,044 --> 00:10:23,578
How stocked is that cafeteria?

178
00:10:23,579 --> 00:10:24,913
It must have plenty of food.

179
00:10:24,914 --> 00:10:27,428
Five guys lasting
almost a year?

180
00:10:27,547 --> 00:10:29,505
It sure as hell don't look
like anybody's been starving.

181
00:10:30,418 --> 00:10:34,255
- There's only a little left.
- We'll take half.

182
00:10:34,256 --> 00:10:37,424
In exchange, we'll help
clear out a cell block.

183
00:10:37,425 --> 00:10:40,427
Didn't you hear him?
There's only a little left.

184
00:10:40,428 --> 00:10:43,564
Bet you got more food
than you got choices.

185
00:10:44,933 --> 00:10:47,367
You pay, we'll play.

186
00:10:47,368 --> 00:10:50,203
We'll clear out a block for
you, then you keep to it.

187
00:10:52,673 --> 00:10:56,721
- All right.
- Well, let's be clear.

188
00:10:56,844 --> 00:11:00,113
If we see you out here
anywhere near our people,

189
00:11:00,114 --> 00:11:02,314
if I so much as even catch
a whiff of your scent,

190
00:11:02,315 --> 00:11:04,416
I will kill you.

191
00:11:09,417 --> 00:11:10,483
Deal.

192
00:11:12,452 --> 00:11:15,021
It has to stop
eventually, right?

193
00:11:15,022 --> 00:11:17,222
It slowed down
quite a bit already.

194
00:11:21,828 --> 00:11:23,351
If we can get him
through this--

195
00:11:23,446 --> 00:11:24,775
When we get him through this.

196
00:11:25,731 --> 00:11:28,466
--we'll need crutches.

197
00:11:28,467 --> 00:11:30,602
Right now we could use
some antibiotics

198
00:11:30,603 --> 00:11:34,305
and painkillers,
some sterile gauze.

199
00:11:34,306 --> 00:11:36,041
There's got to be
an infirmary here.

200
00:11:36,042 --> 00:11:38,342
If there is, we'll find it.

201
00:11:38,343 --> 00:11:42,012
You've gotta be worried sick
about delivering the baby.

202
00:11:42,013 --> 00:11:45,415
Look at me.
Do I look worried?

203
00:11:47,251 --> 00:11:49,486
You look disgusting.

204
00:11:49,487 --> 00:11:51,722
( Laughs ) So do you.

205
00:11:53,892 --> 00:11:56,694
We'll get through this.

206
00:11:58,261 --> 00:12:00,463
Pantry's back here.

207
00:12:02,933 --> 00:12:06,502
You never tried
to break out of here?

208
00:12:06,503 --> 00:12:08,972
<i>Yeah, we tried to take</i>
<i>the doors off.</i>

209
00:12:08,973 --> 00:12:10,740
<i>But if you make</i>
<i>one peep in here,</i>

210
00:12:10,741 --> 00:12:12,609
then those freaks'll be
lined up outside the door

211
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,876
growling, trying to get in.

212
00:12:14,877 --> 00:12:18,117
Windows got bars on there that
he-man couldn't get through.

213
00:12:18,243 --> 00:12:20,711
- Bigger than a 5x8.
- Big Tiny: <i>You won't find me complaining.</i>

214
00:12:20,746 --> 00:12:23,919
<i>Doing 15. My left leg can barely
fit on one of those bunks.</i>

215
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,722
Oscar: <i>Yeah, they don't call
him Big Tiny for nothing.</i>

216
00:12:26,723 --> 00:12:28,590
You done jerking
each other off?

217
00:12:28,591 --> 00:12:30,459
Sick of waiting back here.

218
00:12:56,816 --> 00:12:58,868
This what you call
a little bit of food?

219
00:12:59,047 --> 00:13:00,446
- Goes fast.
- Mm-hmm.

220
00:13:01,221 --> 00:13:03,789
You can have a bag of
corn, some tuna fish--

221
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:06,692
We said half.
That's the deal.

222
00:13:06,693 --> 00:13:09,762
- What's in there?
- Oscar: <i>Don't open that.</i>

223
00:13:09,763 --> 00:13:12,698
( Coughing, gagging )
( Laughing )

224
00:13:12,699 --> 00:13:14,232
He wanted to know.

225
00:13:19,172 --> 00:13:21,674
Can't wait for
my own pot to piss in.

226
00:13:23,809 --> 00:13:25,810
( Wheezing )

227
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:37,314
It was stupid of us
to let him go.

228
00:13:39,536 --> 00:13:42,988
We cleared this whole cell
block, just the five of us.

229
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:45,261
It could have
happened to anyone.

230
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:51,001
What are we gonna
do without him?

231
00:13:51,002 --> 00:13:54,304
Hey, stop it.

232
00:13:54,305 --> 00:13:57,039
All right? Stop it.
( Sighs )

233
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,309
He's still here.

234
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:03,012
What if he does wake up?

235
00:14:04,581 --> 00:14:07,183
Then what?
He can't even walk.

236
00:14:07,184 --> 00:14:09,185
All we do is run.

237
00:14:09,186 --> 00:14:11,220
Hey...

238
00:14:11,221 --> 00:14:14,422
this won't break him.

239
00:14:14,423 --> 00:14:15,924
Okay?

240
00:14:15,925 --> 00:14:18,559
He's got you and Beth.

241
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,263
Am I the only person
living in reality here?

242
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,435
We've been through
so much already.

243
00:14:27,436 --> 00:14:29,870
You're expecting it, too.

244
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:33,607
I'm not expecting, all right?

245
00:14:33,608 --> 00:14:36,676
I'm just preparing.

246
00:14:36,677 --> 00:14:38,212
Why don't you go check on Beth?

247
00:14:38,213 --> 00:14:40,180
Go on.
I'll watch him.

248
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:44,617
( Sighs )

249
00:15:00,584 --> 00:15:02,849
- What are you doing? - He's gonna
have a hard time walking around

250
00:15:02,951 --> 00:15:06,404
with one side of his pants
dragging on the ground.

251
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,439
You know, he could
trip or something.

252
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:15,513
There's a good chance
he won't wake up.

253
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:18,649
- Why are you so eager to give up on him?
- <i>I'm not giving up on him.</i>

254
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:21,485
It sure sounds like it.

255
00:15:21,486 --> 00:15:25,589
I don't want you to get
your hopes too high.

256
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:28,092
We're not equipped to deal
with something like this.

257
00:15:29,494 --> 00:15:32,962
- We have Carol.
- She's not a doctor.

258
00:15:32,963 --> 00:15:35,531
Dad taught her a few things
to help with the baby.

259
00:15:35,532 --> 00:15:37,366
She stopped the bleeding.

260
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,208
These'll do just fine.

261
00:15:48,678 --> 00:15:50,879
- T-Dog: Food's here.
- What you got?

262
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,250
Canned beef, canned corn,
canned cans.

263
00:15:55,251 --> 00:15:57,686
There's a lot more
where this came from.

264
00:15:57,687 --> 00:15:59,188
Any change?

265
00:15:59,189 --> 00:16:02,057
Bleeding is under control
and no fever,

266
00:16:02,058 --> 00:16:05,326
but his breath is labored
and his pulse is way down

267
00:16:05,327 --> 00:16:08,229
and he hasn't opened
his eyes yet.

268
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:11,132
Take my cuffs, put them on him.

269
00:16:11,133 --> 00:16:13,467
I'm not taking any chances.

270
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,880
Yeah.

271
00:16:20,871 --> 00:16:22,428
So what about those prisoners?

272
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,677
( Sighs ) We're gonna help them

273
00:16:24,678 --> 00:16:26,279
clear out their own cell block,

274
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,949
and then they'll be there
and we'll be here.

275
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:31,885
- Living beside each other.
- I'm not giving up this prison.

276
00:16:31,886 --> 00:16:37,622
- Do they have guns?
- I only saw one.

277
00:16:37,623 --> 00:16:41,426
Yeah, I don't know
if it's gonna work.

278
00:16:42,528 --> 00:16:44,997
Well, what are your options?

279
00:16:47,598 --> 00:16:49,090
Kill them.

280
00:16:51,004 --> 00:16:53,504
If that's what
you think is best.

281
00:16:54,506 --> 00:16:58,042
You s--
you say this now...

282
00:16:59,979 --> 00:17:01,715
Look, I know that
I'm a shitty wife

283
00:17:01,836 --> 00:17:04,023
and I'm not winning
any mother of the year awards,

284
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,620
but I need you to know that...

285
00:17:13,024 --> 00:17:17,160
not for one second do I think
there is malice in your heart.

286
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:20,330
You're not a killer,
and I know that.

287
00:17:21,565 --> 00:17:24,400
I know that, so--

288
00:17:27,704 --> 00:17:30,606
so do whatever you gotta do
to keep this group safe.

289
00:17:30,607 --> 00:17:32,508
And do it with
a clear conscience.

290
00:17:48,391 --> 00:17:52,693
Why do I need this
when I got this?

291
00:17:52,694 --> 00:17:54,662
Daryl:
<i>You don't fire guns,</i>

292
00:17:54,663 --> 00:17:57,298
not unless your back's
up against a wall.

293
00:17:57,299 --> 00:17:58,899
Noise attracts them.

294
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,435
It really riles them up.

295
00:18:01,436 --> 00:18:05,605
We'll go in two by two.
Daryl will run point with T.

296
00:18:05,606 --> 00:18:07,841
I'll bring up
the rear with you.

297
00:18:07,842 --> 00:18:10,010
Stay tight, hold formation

298
00:18:10,011 --> 00:18:12,211
no matter how close
the walkers get...

299
00:18:12,212 --> 00:18:14,180
anyone breaks ranks,
we could all go down.

300
00:18:14,181 --> 00:18:15,949
Anyone runs off,

301
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:18,117
they could get mistaken
for a walker,

302
00:18:18,118 --> 00:18:20,153
end up with an axe to the head.

303
00:18:20,154 --> 00:18:21,754
And that's where you aim.

304
00:18:21,755 --> 00:18:23,823
These things only go down
with a head shot.

305
00:18:23,824 --> 00:18:26,792
Ain't gotta tell us
how to take out a man.

306
00:18:26,793 --> 00:18:30,662
They ain't men.
They're something else.

307
00:18:30,663 --> 00:18:33,598
Just remember to go
for the brain.

308
00:18:35,368 --> 00:18:38,170
( Keys jangle )

309
00:18:43,776 --> 00:18:45,343
What's going on?

310
00:18:45,344 --> 00:18:48,361
- We had to.
- It's just a precaution.

311
00:18:53,986 --> 00:18:57,188
You think maybe I could have
a minute alone here?

312
00:18:57,189 --> 00:18:59,223
Yeah, you want me to--?

313
00:18:59,224 --> 00:19:02,025
No, just by myself.

314
00:19:03,426 --> 00:19:04,803
Of course.

315
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,101
I'll be right outside.

316
00:19:41,296 --> 00:19:43,170
Dad...

317
00:19:46,868 --> 00:19:48,902
you don't have
to fight anymore.

318
00:19:55,476 --> 00:19:57,677
If you're worried
about me and Beth, don't.

319
00:19:57,678 --> 00:19:59,812
Don't worry about us.

320
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:04,383
We'll take care of each other.
We'll look out.

321
00:20:04,384 --> 00:20:06,985
Me, Beth, and Glenn
will look out.

322
00:20:12,592 --> 00:20:15,928
Go ahead, dad.
It's okay.

323
00:20:19,066 --> 00:20:21,012
Be peaceful.

324
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,035
You don't have to fight.

325
00:20:31,877 --> 00:20:34,579
If it's time to go, it's okay.

326
00:20:40,518 --> 00:20:44,555
Daddy, I just want
to thank you.

327
00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:50,394
For everything, thank you.

328
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:29,015
Man, it's too
damn dark in here.

329
00:21:29,016 --> 00:21:31,017
Gotta hold it up high
out in front of you.

330
00:21:31,018 --> 00:21:33,948
<i>You're gonna hear them</i>
<i>before you see them.</i>

331
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,895
- It's coming!
- Rick: <i>Shh!</i>

332
00:21:45,131 --> 00:21:48,900
<i>( Clanging, snarling )</i>

( Yelling )

334
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,554
You wanna taste me?

335
00:22:42,452 --> 00:22:45,353
( Door creaks, clangs )

336
00:22:49,158 --> 00:22:51,126
I thought you were
organizing the food.

337
00:22:53,028 --> 00:22:55,430
Even better.

338
00:22:56,632 --> 00:22:59,100
Check it out.

339
00:22:59,101 --> 00:23:01,535
( Gasps )
Where did you get this?

340
00:23:01,536 --> 00:23:03,470
From the infirmary.

341
00:23:03,471 --> 00:23:05,639
<i>Wasn't much left,</i>
<i>but I cleared it out.</i>

342
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,545
- You went by yourself?
- Yeah.

343
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:09,684
Are you crazy?

344
00:23:10,019 --> 00:23:11,978
No big deal. I killed two walkers.

345
00:23:13,414 --> 00:23:15,682
You-- all right,
do you see this?

346
00:23:15,683 --> 00:23:17,817
This was with the whole group.

347
00:23:17,818 --> 00:23:19,552
We needed supplies,
so I got them.

348
00:23:19,553 --> 00:23:23,556
- I appreciate that, but--
- Then get off my back. - Carl!

349
00:23:23,557 --> 00:23:26,392
She's your mother.
You can't talk to her like that.

350
00:23:28,729 --> 00:23:30,830
Listen, I think it's great
that you wanna help--

351
00:23:39,338 --> 00:23:41,339
It's gotta be the brain.

352
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:44,910
Not the stomach,
not the heart-- the brain.

353
00:23:44,911 --> 00:23:47,946
I hear you.
The brain.

354
00:23:48,947 --> 00:23:50,726
- Like that?
- Uh-huh.

355
00:23:57,823 --> 00:24:00,858
Stay in tight formation.
No more prison riot crap.

356
00:24:34,324 --> 00:24:36,325
( Snarling )

357
00:24:46,035 --> 00:24:47,769
Ah!

358
00:25:10,086 --> 00:25:13,011
These bandages will help
prevent infection.

359
00:25:13,994 --> 00:25:15,561
It's good.

360
00:25:15,562 --> 00:25:18,597
It's good that he taught
you all this stuff.

361
00:25:18,598 --> 00:25:21,200
He didn't teach me everything.

362
00:25:26,472 --> 00:25:28,006
I need your help
with something.

363
00:25:28,007 --> 00:25:30,041
- Now?
- Yeah, now.

364
00:25:30,042 --> 00:25:33,044
- What is it?
- Not here.

365
00:25:33,045 --> 00:25:35,346
I can't leave Hershel.

366
00:25:35,347 --> 00:25:37,715
- This is important.
- Carol, I can't--

367
00:25:37,716 --> 00:25:39,717
- Go on. We got it.
- Glenn: <i>No way.</i>

368
00:25:39,718 --> 00:25:42,052
- We'll be fine.
- We're not gonna be gone long.

369
00:25:42,053 --> 00:25:44,721
- Rick said for me--
- We're fine.

370
00:25:50,695 --> 00:25:52,663
All right.

371
00:25:59,771 --> 00:26:02,806
I'm telling you, I don't feel anything.
It's just a scratch.

372
00:26:02,807 --> 00:26:04,641
- I'm sorry, man.
- I can keep fighting!

373
00:26:04,642 --> 00:26:06,910
You cut that old guy's leg
off to save his life.

374
00:26:06,911 --> 00:26:09,179
- Look at where the bite is.
- Guys, I'm fine!

375
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:12,282
Just-- I'm fine.

376
00:26:12,283 --> 00:26:14,917
Look at me-- I'm not changing
into one of those things.

377
00:26:14,918 --> 00:26:16,820
Oscar: Look, man, there has
to be something we can do.

378
00:26:17,037 --> 00:26:19,165
- We could just lock him up.
- Quarantine him.

379
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,557
We gotta do something.
Why you just standing there?

380
00:26:21,558 --> 00:26:23,759
- We gotta save him.
- There's nothing we can do.

381
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,728
You son of a bitch.

( walkers snarling )

384
00:27:13,593 --> 00:27:14,907
Carol:
<i>That one.</i>

385
00:27:21,354 --> 00:27:24,089
Everything you're saying
is completely sane.

386
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:28,660
You're wanting to use a walker
for practice is a sane thing.

387
00:27:28,661 --> 00:27:30,361
I mean it, okay.

388
00:27:30,362 --> 00:27:33,732
I'm just-- I'm just trying
to wrap my mind around it.

389
00:27:35,067 --> 00:27:36,835
Carol:
Lori's overdue.

390
00:27:36,836 --> 00:27:38,737
She had Carl by C-section.

391
00:27:38,738 --> 00:27:41,271
She's probably gonna have
to have this one the same way.

392
00:27:41,272 --> 00:27:44,150
Hershel had a little bit of
experience with this kind of thing,

393
00:27:44,284 --> 00:27:45,943
but he's not gonna
be able to do it anymore.

394
00:27:45,944 --> 00:27:47,444
I need experience

395
00:27:47,445 --> 00:27:49,847
and we have plenty of cadavers.

396
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:55,418
All right, well, like I
said, it's completely sane.

397
00:27:56,787 --> 00:27:58,420
I need to learn
how to cut through

398
00:27:58,421 --> 00:28:00,589
the abdomen and the uterus
without cutting the baby.

399
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:02,625
Why not?

400
00:28:04,962 --> 00:28:06,663
I'll do it.

401
00:28:08,766 --> 00:28:10,266
Okay.

402
00:28:21,979 --> 00:28:25,981
Come on!
Hey, follow me. Come on.

403
00:28:27,716 --> 00:28:29,616
Right here, come on.

<i>Follow me.</i>
<i>That's right.</i>

405
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:32,887
<i>There we go.</i>
<i>Come on!</i>

406
00:28:50,637 --> 00:28:53,039
You see the look on his face?

407
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:57,010
He makes one move,
just give me a signal.

408
00:29:28,411 --> 00:29:31,006
- I ain't opening that.
- Yes, you are.

409
00:29:31,309 --> 00:29:33,110
<i>If you want this cell block,</i>

410
00:29:33,111 --> 00:29:35,078
you're gonna open that door.

411
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:38,249
Just the one, not both of them.

412
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,784
Because we need
to control this.

413
00:30:00,638 --> 00:30:02,772
You bitches ready?

414
00:30:08,711 --> 00:30:10,178
I got this.

415
00:30:12,047 --> 00:30:14,916
- I said one door!
- Shit happens.

416
00:30:40,508 --> 00:30:42,342
T, mind the gap.

417
00:30:55,889 --> 00:31:00,259
- It was coming at me, bro.
- Yeah, yeah, I get it.

418
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,961
I get it.

419
00:31:03,162 --> 00:31:05,106

420
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,606

We don't have no affiliation
to what just happened.

Tell him, Oscar.

427
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,563
Stop talking, man.

Let me back in, man.
Let me back in!

430
00:32:23,105 --> 00:32:25,273
Open it up, man!
Open up!

431
00:32:25,274 --> 00:32:27,609

Sir, please, please,
listen to me!

It was them that was bad.
It wasn't us.

- Oh, that's convenient.
- You saw what he did to Tiny.

Please, we ain't like that.

at it neither.

00:36:17,389 --> 00:36:20,558
Consider yourselves
the lucky ones.

472
00:36:21,626 --> 00:36:23,761
Sorry about your friends, man.

473
00:36:30,035 --> 00:36:31,536
A word of advice--

474
00:36:34,539 --> 00:36:37,541
take those bodies outside
and burn them.

475
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:48,984
<i>( Door clangs )</i>

476
00:36:58,995 --> 00:37:00,329
<i>( Door opens )</i>

477
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:02,831
Hershel stopped breathing.

478
00:37:02,832 --> 00:37:06,022
- Mom saved him.
- It's true.

479
00:37:12,708 --> 00:37:14,409
Still no fever.

480
00:38:11,996 --> 00:38:15,799
Daddy?

481
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,435
Daddy.

482
00:38:18,436 --> 00:38:21,305
( Beth laughs )

483
00:38:22,507 --> 00:38:24,274
Daddy.

484
00:39:01,443 --> 00:39:04,345
( Beth crying )

485
00:39:18,926 --> 00:39:20,525
Come here.

486
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:05,769
<i>( Breathing )</i>

487
00:40:40,035 --> 00:40:42,603
We'll start cleaning tomorrow.

488
00:40:42,604 --> 00:40:47,574
Yeah. It'll give
Carl a safe place to...

489
00:40:47,575 --> 00:40:50,744
do whatever he does these days.

490
00:40:53,481 --> 00:40:57,250
For the record, I-- I don't
think you're a bad mother.

491
00:41:00,587 --> 00:41:03,023
Well, wife
is a different story.

492
00:41:07,128 --> 00:41:09,729
For better or worse, right?

493
00:41:11,832 --> 00:41:13,665
I mean, what are
we gonna do-- hire lawyers

494
00:41:13,666 --> 00:41:16,668
<i>and get divorced</i>
<i>and split our assets?</i>

495
00:41:18,538 --> 00:41:24,810
We got food. Hershel's alive.
Today was a good day.

496
00:41:24,811 --> 00:41:28,112
He'd be dead
if it weren't for you.

497
00:41:28,113 --> 00:41:29,981
You're the one that acted fast.

498
00:41:29,982 --> 00:41:33,084
If you hadn't done
what you did, then...

499
00:41:42,594 --> 00:41:46,096
I thought maybe you were coming
out here to talk about us.

500
00:41:50,634 --> 00:41:53,636
Maybe there's nothing
to talk about anymore.

501
00:42:11,421 --> 00:42:14,523
We're awful grateful
for what you did.
