- Now, when you do...

1262
01:46:30,349 --> 01:46:33,147
...don't forget to say a few prayers
for an old sinner.

1263
01:46:33,786 --> 01:46:37,347
Throw a couple of Hail Marys this way
if that's not too much trouble.

1264
01:46:37,523 --> 01:46:38,547
That a deal?

1265
01:46:38,958 --> 01:46:41,722
- It's a deal.
- Good.

1266
01:46:44,130 --> 01:46:46,030
You know, the first day
you showed up...

1267
01:46:46,199 --> 01:46:49,862
...I thought you were so full of it, I was
tempted to kick you into the street.

1268
01:46:50,036 --> 01:46:53,870
But I didn't because I saw
quite a bit of myself in you.

1269
01:46:55,108 --> 01:46:56,939
Scary, isn't it?

1270
01:46:57,944 --> 01:47:01,505
- Yeah, it sure is.
- Yeah.

1271
01:47:01,914 --> 01:47:06,146
All right, that's it. Thanks for everything.
Safe journey. And one other thing.

1272
01:47:06,319 --> 01:47:09,288
Faith becomes you. Stay with it.

1273
01:47:09,455 --> 01:47:13,824
Keep fighting the good fight
with all thy might.

1274
01:47:15,361 --> 01:47:17,090
Cool.

1275
01:47:18,564 --> 01:47:20,088
Get out of here.

1276
01:47:25,438 --> 01:47:27,406
Goodbye, Father.

Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

1279

MICHAEL:
And what are your sins?
