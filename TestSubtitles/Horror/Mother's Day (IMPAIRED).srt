1
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:00,950
Get your I.D. And sign in, please.

2
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:02,116
Ma'am?

3
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:05,127
Ma'am, you've got to sign in.

4
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,734
Ma'am!

5
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:45,293
Security!

6
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:51,203
Lady! Hold it!

7
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:53,609
Put the baby down.

8
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:56,341
We don't want to get the baby, hurt,
do we?

9
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,076
Come on, lady, stop.

10
00:01:58,184 --> 00:02:01,415
I said stop! Or I will shoot.

11
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:05,080
Hey, Charlie, where the hell are you?

12
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,755
I'm in the basement.

13
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:13,732
Come on, lady, I know you're in here,
so just come on out.

14
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,399
Ok Now That's it. Now, bring...

15
00:02:57,777 --> 00:02:59,244
I was wondering where you went.

16
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,377
I just came to check up on Beth.

17
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:06,509
We're going to have a place like
this someday.

18
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:07,984
But even better.

19
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,084
I don't need all that, Trey.

20
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:13,658
But you could live with it, right?

21
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:18,358
Oh, no. No kids in the master bedroom.
Come on.

22
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:19,726
Up, up, up, up!

23
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:21,595
But, Daniel, I am the Master.

24
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,601
Be the master somewhere else.

25
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,468
I love what you've done with the place,
Daniel.

26
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:28,768
Thank you.

27
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:30,835
Something smells good in here.

28
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,775
Birthday cake in ten minutes, guys.

29
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,144
You're doing great.

30
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:42,385
Oh, could you grab the cooling rack?
It's up there.

31
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:44,012
Have you chosen cabinets?

32
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:46,614
Honestly, I haven't even thought
about that yet.

33
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:50,293
Baby, come on, let's go.

34
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:51,624
Later.

35
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:57,334
You all right?

36
00:03:58,338 --> 00:03:59,566
Yeah.

37
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,235
Just hold it in there, baby brother.

38
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:05,369
What you've fucking done!

39
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:08,208
You quit being a goddamned pussy!

40
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:09,406
You man the fuck up!

41
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:11,608
Johnny, you're going to be okay.
- I told you, Ike!

42
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:14,812
I fucking told you not to trust him!
- I'm not arguing with you right now!

43
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,548
Johnny wants mama!

44
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:18,647
Call mama again.

45
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:19,782
Give me that fucking thing!

46
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:22,383
We're going to get you home.
We're going to get you to mama.

47
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:23,788
Fucking out of service, man!

48
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:24,828
Call Lydia.

49
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:28,389
I'm sorry he took the money guys.
I'm sorry.

50
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:31,898
Calm the fuck down. Hold that there.

51
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,297
Oh, fuck!

52
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:37,103
You think they've got that
backstabbing prick already.

53
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,677
Put that gun down.

54
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,575
They're clearing the roads
for the tornado.

55
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:52,520
Come on, Colour of Money.

56
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:55,153
That ball isn't going to sink itself.

57
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:57,559
Ah, you hit my arm.

58
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,899
Guess you can teach an old dog
some new tricks.

59
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,662
You'd be surprised what this old dog
can do.

60
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,931
Lissy, I've been making these
since junior high. I know the feel.

61
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,507
You don't "feel" margaritas.
It's a very precise ratio.

62
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:09,404
I'm an artist.

63
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:10,999
I know you are, baby.

64
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:14,975
Hey, guys, you might want to check
this out.

65
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:18,050
They're issuing a tornado warning.
It's very serious.

66
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,085
Tornado virgin, I'll protect you.

67
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:22,620
This cellar is the safest place you
could be.

68
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:24,417
Whole thing's just been reinforced...

69
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:26,725
and Charlie put in new storm doors.
We're all okay.

70
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,021
No way. The city's got to be
the safest place to be.

71
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:32,859
At least here, kids go to public school
and make it home alive.

72
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:34,660
So why do you keep a gun in the office,
then?

73
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:37,167
For when you get feisty, sweetheart.

74
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,073
It's okay baby, we'll be home soon.

75
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:44,940
Are you okay?

76
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:47,342
That was the babysitter.
Rachel is still up.

77
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:49,108
The weather's freaking her out.

78
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:50,648
I hate to leave before the cake...

79
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,615
but we should really get going
before it gets any worse.

80
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,448
Yeah, no, sure, that'll be fun.

81
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:58,615
We'll put a tent up in the basement,
make some popcorn...

82
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,755
Put on Toy Story.

83
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:03,353
Sure, you're okay with this.

84
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:04,521
What? Toy Story?

85
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,825
I mean, me and Rachel.

86
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,331
Insta-family.

87
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:36,828
Danny boy.

88
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:41,062
Here's your present.

89
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:43,662
You can't keep it.

90
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,328
Can he unwrap it?

91
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:51,238
Come on. I'm embarrassed.

92
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:56,539
Show me your stick-work, birthday bay.

93
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,975
My beautiful wife's right there.

94
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:00,878
I'm kidding.

95
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:04,320
I know. It's okay.

96
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:09,623
Come on, let's see what you got, baby.

97
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,170
Wait a minute. What the fuck?

98
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,446
What the fuck is this shit?

99
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:37,413
This house. Ike. What the fuck
is this shit?

100
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:39,218
Ike, are we in the wrong fucking house?

101
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:40,952
Ike! Are we in the wrong fucking house?

102
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,187
No! We're not in the wrong fucking house

103
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:44,794
So, you're an associate in Daniel's firm
right?

104
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:46,489
That's right.
- What's he like to work for?

105
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:48,760
He's tough, but I'm learning a lot.

106
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:52,970
Hey, what's going on upstairs?

107
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:54,266
Oh, it's probably Charlie.

108
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:55,806
You left the door unlocked?

109
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:56,840
Maybe.

110
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,635
Charlie!

111
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:02,476
Charlie!

112
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:04,247
Charlie, boy!

113
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:09,381
What's up?

114
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:11,450
What the hell are you guys doing
in my house?

115
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:14,154
What are you doing in our house?

116
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:18,854
Okay, okay.

117
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:20,023
What are you doing in our fucking house?

118
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:21,292
It's my house.

119
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:22,598
How long have you lived here?

120
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:25,034
Two months.
- It's not your god damned house!

121
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:29,096
It's not your god damned house!

122
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:31,471
It's our house!

123
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:32,566
You shut the fuck up!

124
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,839
You don't how many people are around.

125
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:46,385
We are issuing a tornado warning.

126
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:50,952
All our fucking shit is gone!

127
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:52,629
I'm fucking sorry, man.

128
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:53,960
That's right,
you're going to be fucking sorry.

129
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:54,760
What's your name?

130
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,835
Daniel. Daniel Sohapi.

131
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:58,494
You don't look so happy to me.

132
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,500
How many other people are here?

133
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:03,768
Nobody.

134
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,741
Nobody else? What do you think, John?
Is he telling the truth?

135
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:08,871
Jesus asshole Christ! What the fuck
is going on?

136
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:13,248
This is three bubbles in here, man.
Three fucking bubbles!

137
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,318
Johnny.

138
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:16,217
How the fuck did this happen?

139
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:17,550
I don't know.
Maybe she's lost or something.

140
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:18,282
I don't know.

141
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,359
Foreclosure.
We bought the house on a foreclosure.

142
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:22,620
We got to get the fuck out of here
right now.

143
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,121
Mama! Mama!

144
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:28,696
Run! Run baby! Run!

145
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:38,038
Help me! Help me!

146
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:51,888
Don't you hurt her!

147
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:54,118
Sit down! Everybody calm down!

148
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:55,784
Now how many people are downstairs?

149
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:56,862
Five.

150
00:09:57,997 --> 00:09:59,123
Six. Six.

151
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:01,791
Fucking bullshit!
Let's just off these two assholes!

152
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:05,534
Let's off these two assholes
and get the fuck out of here!

153
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:06,161
We can't do that.

154
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,102
Why not?

155
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:08,173
We can't just kill them, man.

156
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,002
Why can't we kill them?

157
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,439
Because everybody downstairs...

158
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:12,067
You already fucked this up!

159
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:13,839
You fucked up.

160
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,312
Why can't I fucking talk to you?

161
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,044
Are you okay?

162
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:24,949
Our friend is a doctor.

163
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:28,015
Our friend is a doctor.
He's downstairs and he can help you.

164
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,059
Bullshit!

165
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:30,628
Kill the fucking cunt!

166
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:34,194
Walk away!

167
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:38,732
Come here.

168
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:40,328
All right, just...

169
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:44,774
I'm not lying.

170
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:46,936
Your brother's shot and he can help you.

171
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:50,243
Your brother's shot and he can die.
He can help you.

172
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:53,615
Now Daniel's your husband?

173
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:54,845
Yes.

174
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:56,814
Now you have thirty seconds.

175
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,453
I'm going to be listening.

176
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:01,458
You take a foot off the bottom step
or act like anything's wrong...

177
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,686
all your friends are going to die.

178
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:06,026
And I'll make sure that Daniel here
takes a long time to go.

179
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:07,030
Okay?

180
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:08,532
Do you understand me?

181
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:11,494
Do you understand me?

182
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:14,095
I understand. I understand you.

183
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:16,197
Good.

184
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:18,672
All right, let's go. Come on.

185
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:41,032
George?

186
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:42,931
George?

187
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:44,928
George!

188
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,197
Yeah?

189
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:49,304
Can you help me with something upstairs?

190
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:50,773
Sure. Yeah.

191
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:51,873
We're out of here?

192
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:53,467
Whenever you're ready.

193
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:56,773
Where's Danny at B?

194
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,713
You guys having your own party upstairs?

195
00:11:58,818 --> 00:11:59,842
What do you need?

196
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,285
Hey? Are you okay?

197
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,292
I'm sorry.

198
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,395
Go! Go, go!

199
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,295
What the fuck is going on?

200
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:22,501
Stop it!

201
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:24,132
He can't help you if you hurt him!

202
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,369
Bitch, you shut the fuck up!

203
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,605
My brother's been shot. Help him!

204
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:28,577
Are you a doctor or not?

205
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:29,147
Yes!

206
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,443
Fantastic! Let's go.

207
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:38,046
We've got to get him to a hospital.

208
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:39,181
That's not going to happen.

209
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,315
He'll die if we don't.

210
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,156
He does and he won't be the only one.
Fix it!

211
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:45,664
Beth?

212
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:47,765
I need rubbing alcohol and plastic.

213
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:48,891
Like a coffee lid or something.

214
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:51,196
And a butane lighter and a spatula.
Metal.

215
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:52,895
Now. Okay?

216
00:12:57,977 --> 00:12:58,807
Hello?

217
00:12:58,911 --> 00:12:59,605
Ike?

218
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:00,542
Lydia?

219
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:02,409
I got your messages.

220
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,079
Where are you? Where's mom?

221
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:06,879
She's here with me.
But why are you calling?

222
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,317
You're not supposed to use this phone.

223
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,444
Johnny's been hurt.

224
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:10,954
Hurt? How bad?

225
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:13,786
The kind that when it stops hurting
it's because you're dead.

226
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,360
Where are you?

227
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,396
We're at the house.
Just get mother and get here fast.

228
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:20,192
Ike? That's not our house anymore!

229
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,425
It is now.

230
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:24,264
Do they have any aspirin?

231
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,804
Calm down.
It's giving me a headache!

232
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,906
Stay down!

233
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,240
Julie, what's wrong?

234
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,644
Addley!

235
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:41,917
Addley! Addley?

236
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:45,252
Get the fuck back! Get the fuck back!

237
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:47,458
Get down on your hands and knees!

238
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,357
Get down on the floor!

239
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:50,819
Where's Legs?

240
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:52,997
For fuck's sake!

241
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,935
Addley! Just talk to me!
What is going on?

242
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,405
Get the fuck up!

243
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:07,305
You! Come here! Come here!

244
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:08,209
Pick her up!

245
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:09,679
This gun is in your fucking ear!

246
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:11,044
You better not be moving over there!

247
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:15,416
I see faces!
I want to see tops of your heads!

248
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,783
You got it under control?

249
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,982
I need a fucking padlock!

250
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:25,989
Blondie! Do you have a padlock?

251
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:26,757
Yeah.

252
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,266
Go get it. Now.

253
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:34,672
Everybody take your wallets out.
And your cell phones.

254
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:35,705
Put them on the floor next to you.

255
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:38,743
And if I ask you again I'm going to
shoot you in the fucking head!

256
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:44,708
Fucking disco!

257
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,176
I hate disco!

258
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:47,517
Up we go.

259
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:53,683
Doc, you just keep doing
what you're doing.

260
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:55,191
I'm in control, okay?

261
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:56,226
Okay.

262
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:03,927
Go.

263
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,631
Go ahead, queen bee!

264
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:07,829
Join your friends. Come on.

265
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:10,735
Here.

266
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:19,814
You got it?

267
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,250
That's nice and tight!

268
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,412
That's like I like it.

269
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:27,857
All right.
Keep an eye on them. Just an eye.

270
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,518
Addley, you understand
what I'm saying to you?

271
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:31,755
You fucking control yourself.

272
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:33,259
Mama's coming.

273
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:35,127
All right.

274
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,778
On the lookout for four suspects.
All Caucasian males.

275
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,475
They are believed to be responsible
for...

276
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:55,883
up to five other bank robberies
since July.

277
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,150
I know. I know.

278
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:04,127
...for a 1985 station wagon which
they are now driving was stolen.

279
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:05,594
What's going on down there?

280
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:06,995
How is everybody?

281
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:09,226
Do your job doc.
Everybody's going to be fine.

282
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:10,165
You got a cell phone?

283
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:10,758
Yeah.

284
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:11,961
Give it to me.

285
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:13,528
Take it.

286
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:15,899
What the fuck did I just say?

287
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:17,339
Get your fucking hands off me.

288
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:18,910
You think you're real tough, huh?

289
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:20,308
Tough little bitch.

290
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:22,505
Got anything else to say? Huh?

291
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:25,815
Chew this and shut the fuck...

292
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:31,386
You think you're fucking tough?

293
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:34,158
You think I give a shit
what my brother says? Huh?

294
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:37,126
You think you're safe cause
I can't touch you? Huh?

295
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,456
This your Mrs.?

296
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:40,657
Soon to be.

297
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:42,700
Let me tell you what's soon to be.

298
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,466
I will soon bend you over
this fucking table...

299
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:47,869
and I'll fuck the tough right
out of you.

300
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:49,600
Right in front of your future ex here.

301
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,437
And we'll see how tough you are.

302
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:54,171
We'll see how much he wants to marry you
when I'm done with you.

303
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,107
Get the fuck up.

304
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:00,409
Hey you?

305
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:01,643
Get up!

306
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:05,790
Come here.
Get your fucking ass over here.

307
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:07,222
Don't you fucking move!

308
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:08,315
What you got there?
- Nothing.

309
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:09,655
A little hair hat?

310
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:11,127
A little piece? Huh?

311
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:14,760
You sit still. Don't you fucking move.

312
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:16,964
Get the fuck off!

313
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,199
Fucker thought I didn't know,
didn't you?

314
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:22,739
I fucking knew it.

315
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:25,674
You got that William Shatner rug,
don't you?

316
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:27,245
How long have these people lived here?

317
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:28,142
About two months.

318
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:29,976
Two? Just our luck.

319
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:31,049
What is that going to do?

320
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,412
It'll help you out...

321
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,044
Hold still!

322
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:43,919
If this isn't working out I'm going to
try something else, all right?

323
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,725
It hurts so bad!

324
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:51,864
Don't do that again.

325
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:53,933
You're going to fuck this up,
you know that?

326
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,273
I'm trying to help your brother.

327
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,933
That's why you're still alive.

328
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:16,383
Hey, look at me!

329
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:17,794
You see?

330
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:20,021
Dancing hair.

331
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:21,196
We know that you're in charge.

332
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,565
I don't understand why you think
you need to prove it to us.

333
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,639
Don't Dr. Phil me!

334
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:30,640
I isn’t here for you to understand!

335
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:31,367
Addley?

336
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:32,444
What?

337
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:34,310
Mother's here.

338
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:41,041
She's not going to be happy.

339
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:43,714
Well, what are you going to tell her,
Ike?

340
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:45,914
Ike, what are you going to tell her?

341
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:58,596
Hello mother.

342
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:02,801
What happened, Ike?

343
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:04,841
There was a problem on the job.

344
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:07,411
And what did I teach you top do
when there's a problem?

345
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:09,375
Use the emergency phone.

346
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,278
And did you do that, Ike?

347
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,042
No, I lost that phone.

348
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,245
You lost the one connection we had.

349
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:17,788
So I couldn't tell you
we lost the house.

350
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:19,485
I'm sorry, mama.

351
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:25,455
I told you to hold on to that phone
with your life.

352
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,333
You didn't listen.

353
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,534
Hey, kiddo.

354
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:40,035
What's with the ride?

355
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:41,737
It's home now, Ike.

356
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:48,017
Johnny.

357
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,146
Mom? I'm sorry about the gunshot.

358
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:55,024
I don't want to die.

359
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:58,824
You're not going to die, baby.

360
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:01,830
It hurts so fucking badly, mama.

361
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:02,628
I'm right here.

362
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:05,134
I don't want to die here.

363
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:08,001
No, no, sweetheart. No.

364
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,175
You promise me you're not
going to leave your mama.

365
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:12,368
You promise me you're not
going to leave me.

366
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:13,808
I promise.

367
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:16,277
Don't cry. Don't cry.

368
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:23,980
And you are?

369
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:25,347
I'm a doctor.

370
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:29,823
You called a doctor, Ike?

371
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:33,364
He was already here.
He's a friend of the new owners.

372
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:39,760
I'm right here.

373
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:42,567
Now you just rest.

374
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:46,041
Thank you. Thank you for saving my son.

375
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:48,640
Look, I haven't saved anybody.
Your son needs hospital care.

376
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:52,239
No hospitals. No hospitals.

377
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:54,883
Lydia?

378
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:58,589
You assist this kind man.

379
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,453
Do whatever he needs.

380
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:04,121
Ike. Come with me.

381
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:06,388
Yes, mama.

382
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:08,630
Hi, Lydia?

383
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:12,199
Hey, Johnny. How are you doing there?

384
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:13,595
Not good.

385
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:16,767
So what happened exactly?

386
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,399
Mother, we were double-crossed.

387
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,442
Our partner Ethan told me...

388
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:22,980
What is the cardinal rule I taught you,
Ike?

389
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:25,276
Never trust anyone but family.

390
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:28,580
Tell me at least you got the money.

391
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:31,684
He took it all.

392
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:36,519
There's a reason for rules, Ike.

393
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,119
I didn't teach you them because
I like to hear myself talk.

394
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:41,358
I teach them because they work!

395
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,024
I can fix this.

396
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:45,661
Just tell me how. I'll fix it.

397
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:47,538
How many others are there in the house?

398
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,004
Eight downstairs.

399
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:50,435
Adults?

400
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:53,473
All right, well,
come morning if they're not home...

401
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:54,909
the police are going to be right here
looking for them.

402
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:56,844
So we're going to have to be out of
the country by then.

403
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:58,381
What are we waiting for?
I'll grab Johnny...

404
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,280
Gabriel is going to take us
across the border.

405
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:01,909
But the rush is going to cost us.

406
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:02,850
How much?

407
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:04,683
Ten grand, which we don't have.

408
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,189
But what about the money we've been
sending you?

409
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:07,724
Money? What money?

410
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:27,075
Addley?

411
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:30,505
This is unacceptable.

412
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:34,109
I swear, sometimes,
you boys are just little savages.

413
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:37,355
Please?

414
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:39,117
Please, get up.

415
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:41,558
Make yourselves comfortable.

416
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,355
I don't want you lying there.

417
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:44,620
Please, Ike?

418
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:45,856
Come.

419
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:48,899
Go sit over there.
Go sit down on the sofas.

420
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:52,669
I'm so sorry. I don't want you
lying there on the floor.

421
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:56,432
I take it this... This belongs to you?

422
00:22:57,008 --> 00:22:58,305
Yes.

423
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:01,773
You look better without it.

424
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,778
Thank you.

425
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:04,915
Please. Make yourselves comfortable.

426
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:09,384
Let's just talk.

427
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:20,425
Please sit down.

428
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:25,936
I'm sure you're very frightened.

429
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:28,267
And believe me,
though it may not seem that way...

430
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:29,863
my children are too.

431
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,101
Which of you are the new owners?

432
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:37,246
We are.

433
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,008
Ma'am?

434
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:43,354
We did not buy this house to hurt you.

435
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:46,757
My husband and I,
we just needed to get out of the city.

436
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:48,018
And I'm a realtor.

437
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:50,720
And I snapped it up
before it went on auction.

438
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:52,387
And we can get it back to you.

439
00:23:52,697 --> 00:23:54,790
We can get you the deed back.

440
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:57,067
Would that it were that easy, my dear.

441
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,398
No, what I want is to leave you
in peace.

442
00:24:02,073 --> 00:24:03,631
We simply need a little time.

443
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:07,200
And then we'll be out of your hair.
No pun intended.

444
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:08,108
What about George?

445
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:10,738
George. He's upstairs.

446
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:14,379
I think he saved my son's life.

447
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:17,221
You should be very proud of him.

448
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:20,018
Just like I'm very proud of my boys.

449
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:22,417
They never forget their mama.

450
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:25,955
Apparently they've even been
sending me cash here...

451
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:28,999
to this address for the last
couple of months.

452
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,590
You mean you never got that money, mama?

453
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:33,637
We never received any money.

454
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:35,000
No, I'll bet.

455
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:36,801
I swear to god.

456
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,478
Dishonesty.

457
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:47,009
That's the Devil's truth.

458
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:48,608
And I will not tolerate it.

459
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,087
Not from my own children.
Certainly not from you.

460
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:53,513
Now.

461
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:55,083
Look at me.

462
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,894
Because if someone's lying...

463
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:00,620
there will be consequences.

464
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:02,222
I can guarantee you it.

465
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:11,668
Your name is?

466
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,277
Beth.

467
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:15,343
Beth.

468
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:21,177
I'm sorry we had to meet under
these circumstances.

469
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:25,482
But I need to know if you're
telling me the truth.

470
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:26,982
Please.

471
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:31,694
Nothing has ever come to this house
for you.

472
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:38,729
I believe you.

473
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:40,898
Thank you.

474
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:46,004
You, I'm not so sure about.

475
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:51,105
No, wait. I swear to God!
We never got anything!

476
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,478
What are you guys doing?

477
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:55,316
Just listen to me for a second!

478
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:55,977
Put his hand on the table.

479
00:25:56,087 --> 00:26:00,490
Just listen to me!
I don't have any money! Don't do this!

480
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:01,320
We never got any money.

481
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:03,053
Shut it!

482
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:06,223
Please don't do this!

483
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:11,799
Stop it! He's telling the truth!

484
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:15,564
Where's the money?

485
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:19,276
Again.
- He's telling the truth!

486
00:26:19,377 --> 00:26:21,504
Stop it!

487
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:22,807
He doesn't know anything!

488
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,882
That's enough, boys.

489
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:42,562
Hey Daniel. Daniel, buddy? Look at me

490
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:43,861
I'm okay.

491
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:50,939
How much?

492
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:53,140
About a grand.

493
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:55,169
Well, that simply won't do.

494
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:59,443
Look what they've done to our house.

495
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:02,151
All right, I'm going to need everyone...

496
00:27:02,854 --> 00:27:05,288
to please write down your full names...

497
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,324
and your ATM pin numbers.

498
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:10,951
That's a lovely ring.

499
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:12,029
Thank you.

500
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:12,762
Take it.

501
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:14,593
No, please.

502
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:16,826
Wait, wait.
It belonged to my grandmother.

503
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:19,028
Oh, whoa, whoa.

504
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:21,730
Family heirloom. That's irreplaceable.

505
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,932
Thank you.

506
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:23,967
Her ring.

507
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:24,939
Take it.

508
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:26,200
Her ring.

509
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:29,237
Come on, come on. Take it off.

510
00:27:29,347 --> 00:27:30,006
I can't.

511
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:31,377
Take it off!

512
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:33,577
Take it off or I'll cut it off.

513
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:36,647
What is your name?

514
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,148
Julie.

515
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:41,520
Julie.

516
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:44,055
Here.

517
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:45,693
I'm sorry you got hurt.

518
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:49,295
All right, I am...

519
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:52,092
going to have Ike...

520
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:54,629
take Beth upstairs.

521
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:57,207
No, don't take Beth. Take me.

522
00:27:57,308 --> 00:27:59,469
No, no listen. It's very simple.

523
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:01,704
You're the man of the house.

524
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:05,579
So it's going to be your job to keep all
these people in line...

525
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:09,677
while Ike and Beth have to go run their
little errand.

526
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:11,483
Now if you do that...

527
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:16,253
we should be out of here,
I would say, eight o'clock.

528
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:19,522
But if you somehow can't handle
this simple task...

529
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:21,360
I'm going to call Ike...

530
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:23,434
and Beth will pay the price.

531
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:26,563
Same rules apply...

532
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:30,471
if you fail to cooperate
with anything Ike says.

533
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:32,372
Beth, look at me.

534
00:28:32,577 --> 00:28:36,809
Your husband and your friends are going to
suffer for it. All right?

535
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:38,740
Melissa, no!

536
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,647
Sit the fuck down!

537
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:44,819
Melissa?

538
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:45,683
Melissa!

539
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:46,757
Help!

540
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:47,916
No!

541
00:28:58,136 --> 00:28:59,831
She always this impulsive?

542
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:07,610
Take it down a notch, Ike.

543
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,015
Come on, baby.

544
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:21,990
Addley?

545
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,651
I got it under control, ma.

546
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:25,863
My boys!

547
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:29,900
Addie? Tell Lydia to come down
with the bag and get this stuff.

548
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:30,831
All right.

549
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:32,635
Time to go.

550
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:44,141
Now remember.

551
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:46,812
You need to behave.

552
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:50,543
Get in.

553
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:58,756
Hey, be careful on the roads, Ike.

554
00:29:58,863 --> 00:30:00,763
This weather could help or hurt us.

555
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:03,493
I need you back here not a second
after eight.

556
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,963
Try not to mess up this time.

557
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,667
And Beth? Beth?

558
00:30:09,774 --> 00:30:10,706
Hey!

559
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:12,700
Remember the rules, dear.

560
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,302
Your friends are counting on you.

561
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:17,906
Hey, mom?

562
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:32,695
These people just rolled up our life.

563
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:37,158
And put it in the trash.

564
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:41,968
We still have each other, mama.

565
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:49,338
Move the cars to the back
and siphon all their gas.

566
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:52,814
We've got a long drive ahead of us.

567
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:54,384
Yes mama.

568
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:12,092
Calm down.

569
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:16,100
You didn't do anything wrong.

570
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:18,634
I didn't do anything wrong?

571
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:20,973
No. You did what had to be done.

572
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:22,941
You did it for the family.

573
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:31,714
Mama?

574
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:35,192
How come you didn't tell us
that you lost the house?

575
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:36,521
I tried.

576
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,253
But your brother made it impossible.

577
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:41,457
He made a bad mistake.

578
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,499
Yeah, he does that.

579
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:49,099
Addley?

580
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:53,007
Ike told me you struck one of them
downstairs.

581
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:55,110
And it was a girl.

582
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:57,075
I was scared.

583
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,940
You always said.
You said. You told me.

584
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:01,518
Bark loud.

585
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:02,483
Show them whose boss.

586
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,885
No. I said don't bark.

587
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:08,186
Wait and then bite.

588
00:32:09,727 --> 00:32:11,194
I'm sorry.

589
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:14,323
And what else did I teach you?

590
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,065
Don't ever strike a woman.

591
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:21,229
That's right.

592
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:23,773
Hit me again, mama.

593
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:29,541
No baby. No, no.
- Hit me.

594
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:31,614
I love you baby.

595
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:33,273
Mama loves you.

596
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,780
Now let's get back to business.

597
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:38,446
Rise and shine boy!

598
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:41,318
Get your fucking hands off me!
- Take it easy!

599
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:43,121
Don't try it!

600
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:44,554
Where's Melissa?

601
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,594
She's out with Beth and Ike.

602
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:49,633
You'll see her when they get back.

603
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:53,134
Now George,
it's important that you listen.

604
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:58,271
I understand rage.
But rage can get you killed.

605
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:00,810
It can throw you off your focus.

606
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:03,437
And you need to focus, George.

607
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:06,945
Because if my son dies...

608
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,244
then you die.

609
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:12,220
And so will all your friends.

610
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:13,915
You understand this, lady.

611
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:17,392
If you hurt any more of my friends...

612
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:20,464
I'm going to let your baby boy die
right in front of you.

613
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:22,897
You've got gumption.

614
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:25,058
Good for you.

615
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:40,511
Get out.

616
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:42,718
Get out.

617
00:33:43,287 --> 00:33:46,222
Beth, I'm not going to ask you again.
Get out of the fucking car.

618
00:33:58,369 --> 00:33:59,631
Now open it.

619
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:01,928
Open the damn door!

620
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:13,741
Get her out.

621
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:16,716
Get her out.

622
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:19,380
I'm so sorry.

623
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,220
Damn it.

624
00:34:27,298 --> 00:34:29,163
Not on my shoes.

625
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:34,267
You know, Beth. You are fucking useless.

626
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:35,737
You are useless!

627
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,933
I bet your husband loves that!

628
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,238
Damn it, this bitch is heavy.

629
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:43,745
Beth? Grab her ankles.

630
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:49,216
Be fucking gentle!

631
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,515
She won't mind. I promise you.

632
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:12,208
You don't say hi
to your big brother anymore?

633
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:18,545
Why do you look so scared?

634
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:23,150
Did you see Queenie out there?

635
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:26,686
Just shut up, Addley. I'm not five.

636
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,100
Can you just put that on him?

637
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:41,228
Come on!

638
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,206
Fuck, motherfucker.

639
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:46,534
I told you.

640
00:35:47,044 --> 00:35:49,842
They're shatterproof tornado windows.

641
00:35:49,947 --> 00:35:52,040
You're not going to break them.

642
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,448
Tornado windows? You're joking, right?

643
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:55,951
You okay?

644
00:35:56,053 --> 00:35:57,213
Get away from me.

645
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:58,720
Oh come on, Annette.

646
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:01,151
You just sat there and watched
that piece of shit torment...

647
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:03,056
The fucking guy had a gun!

648
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:08,122
Trey, what's going on?

649
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:09,391
What are you doing?

650
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:10,761
Finding a way out of here.

651
00:36:10,868 --> 00:36:13,166
Yeah Gabriel.
We need to meet you sooner.

652
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:15,705
Five a. m. At the border.
Ten thousand.

653
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:17,239
Is that still going to work?

654
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:19,369
You will have it in full.

655
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:21,137
Okay, thanks.

656
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:44,700
That little smile. That little smile.

657
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:50,601
We need weapons. We need a plan.

658
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,437
I have a plan.

659
00:36:54,111 --> 00:36:56,170
We're going to do exactly
what they said to do.

660
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,440
Nothing. - Yes. Good.

661
00:36:57,548 --> 00:37:00,142
And wait for that lunatic
to bring my wife back.

662
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:01,343
That's not a plan, Danny.

663
00:37:01,452 --> 00:37:04,615
I'm with Trey. I say we do something.

664
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:05,989
Julie?

665
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:10,019
Julie?

666
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:13,120
Don't fucking touch me.

667
00:37:13,998 --> 00:37:15,465
Oh Jesus.

668
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:24,874
Mama wants to see her.

669
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:26,508
No.

670
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:29,210
She's not going up there alone.

671
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:35,443
No, I can take care of myself.

672
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:37,077
Annette? Annette!

673
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:40,581
Damn it.

674
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:48,430
Just moments ago Kansas State Police
apprehended Ethan Poe.

675
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:51,365
One of four suspects wanted
in connection with the robbery...

676
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:53,960
of First Omaha Bank earlier today.

677
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:56,835
The other three suspects are
still at large.

678
00:37:57,975 --> 00:38:00,102
Could you help me with the ice cream,
dear?

679
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:02,244
It's in the freezer.

680
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:13,253
You are one tough cookie, aren't you?

681
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:15,921
Where's Melissa?

682
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:17,892
She's out with Beth and Ike.

683
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:31,972
No, no, no. That's not how you do it.

684
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:43,885
Cuts through much easier. See?

685
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:46,479
It makes a nice round scoop.

686
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:48,251
The kids love that.

687
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:51,291
You'll see when you have a few
of your own.

688
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,156
Lydia?

689
00:38:57,501 --> 00:39:00,664
I guess your mother never taught you
those sort of things, huh?

690
00:39:00,771 --> 00:39:04,002
Well, it must have been hard
for her though. And you.

691
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:06,303
After your daddy left.

692
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:08,441
Right?

693
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:12,073
I've known a few tough cookies
in my day.

694
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,348
Can you please let us go?

695
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:16,852
Can't you see that's what
I'm trying to do?

696
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:19,115
My boys messed up.

697
00:39:19,223 --> 00:39:22,420
It's in their nature to huff and puff
and wave things around...

698
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:23,959
and think that's being strong.

699
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:25,961
But real strength...

700
00:39:27,064 --> 00:39:28,895
is knowing where you stand.

701
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:32,502
And guiding others to that position.

702
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,869
Why don't you take this downstairs
to your friends?

703
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:42,241
Something nice. Something yummy.

704
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:05,491
Show me your camera smile.

705
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,637
You can do better than that.

706
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,038
Your friends are counting on you.

707
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:14,634
Show me the one you use when you've
had a shitty day...

708
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:16,303
but you want dear old Danny
to be happy...

709
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,177
when he gets home from work?

710
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,449
You know Beth?
You're a really pretty girl.

711
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:34,456
Let's go.

712
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:44,698
Her name was Melissa.

713
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:47,335
She had a three year old girl...
- Shut up.

714
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:51,808
She was a single mother, now there's
no one to watch her. - Shut up!

715
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:52,813
We didn't have a choice.

716
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:54,441
Of course you had a choice.

717
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:56,543
Addley did what he did to protect
the family, Beth.

718
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:59,282
Just like you'd kill me to protect yours

719
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:00,721
Anyone can be a killer if they
have to be.

720
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:01,757
It's human nature.

721
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:03,952
That's bullshit and you know it.

722
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:05,528
You didn't have to do it.

723
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,563
You killed a mother and orphaned a child

724
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:09,565
That's consequences, Beth.

725
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:11,961
She didn't listen so she paid the price.

726
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:13,730
Don't you make the same mistake.

727
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:17,169
Your camera smile.

728
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:30,679
Nice and easy.

729
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:31,846
Are you trying to kill us?

730
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:34,390
Oh come on!
I only drive better when I'm drunk.

731
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:35,689
Oh shoot! Do you have your card?

732
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:37,090
You just do your job, I'll do mine.

733
00:41:37,194 --> 00:41:40,891
Do you have yours?
- I can't find mine.

734
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:43,091
Hi. How you doing?

735
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,631
Okay. Quietly.

736
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:50,466
I've got to pee. Okay, come on you guys.
Hurry up.

737
00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:54,476
There's an ATM down the street.
That's probably your best bet.

738
00:41:54,578 --> 00:41:56,944
The storm's coming.
I'd get going if I were you.

739
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:08,287
Honey? Do you need my help?
Cause I can help you.

740
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:10,257
Get this done. Nobody gets hurt.

741
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:11,885
Okay, seriously? Hurry up.

742
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:19,994
I have an extra card just in case you
don't have enough there.

743
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:21,965
How awkward.

744
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:31,778
He's got a gun!

745
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:32,576
Let's go!

746
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:33,775
Damn it, Beth!

747
00:42:34,118 --> 00:42:34,709
Get in the car!

748
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:36,911
Get away from that fucking car.

749
00:42:37,988 --> 00:42:39,455
Someone help us!
- Shut up!

750
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:40,524
Go on the other side of the car.

751
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:41,818
You know what, Beth?

752
00:42:41,926 --> 00:42:43,393
I fucking told you, didn't I?

753
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:45,959
Didn't I tell you?
Get on your knees, cows. Now!

754
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,189
Everyone shut up.

755
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:50,290
Didn't I tell you there
would be consequences?

756
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:55,230
What are you going to do to us?

757
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:56,670
I'm not going to do anything.

758
00:42:57,808 --> 00:42:58,775
You are.

759
00:42:59,643 --> 00:43:02,305
Whoever kills the other first
gets to live.

760
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:04,040
What? Are you serious?

761
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:05,945
That's sick. You're joking, right?

762
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,449
Thirty seconds and then I'm going
to kill you both.

763
00:43:07,551 --> 00:43:10,042
Ike, you can't do this to them.
Please don't do this.

764
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:12,884
I'm not doing this to them.
I'm doing this to you.

765
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:15,390
You understand? You gave me no choice.

766
00:43:15,492 --> 00:43:16,959
Don't kill us, please!

767
00:43:17,294 --> 00:43:18,261
I don't want to die.

768
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:19,624
Then pick up the knife and kill her!

769
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:22,665
We'll get you money. How much?
We can get you money.

770
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:24,700
I don't have time for the check to clear

771
00:43:24,802 --> 00:43:28,135
20 seconds. 19. 18. 17.

772
00:43:28,238 --> 00:43:29,705
Please, I don't know what to do!

773
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:31,069
I don't know how to help you!

774
00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:32,608
Don't look at her, look at me.

775
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:35,674
10. 9. 8.

776
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,644
Pick up the fucking knife.

777
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:40,481
What are you doing? Are you insane?

778
00:43:40,584 --> 00:43:42,711
Now we're getting somewhere.
Right Beth?

779
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,811
See what you did?
You're going to be a hero.

780
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:46,822
Put the knife down, Vicki!
What are you doing?

781
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:50,917
What do you think, Beth?
Does Vicki have it in her?

782
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:51,756
Stop it!

783
00:43:51,862 --> 00:43:53,796
Put the fucking knife down!

784
00:43:58,802 --> 00:43:59,894
That's a shame.

785
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:01,435
I'm going to have to kill you both.

786
00:44:05,275 --> 00:44:06,606
Finish it.

787
00:44:07,444 --> 00:44:10,607
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

788
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:18,149
Beth. That's human nature for you.

789
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:20,782
Help!

790
00:44:21,558 --> 00:44:23,116
Help!

791
00:44:30,968 --> 00:44:32,299
What are you doing now, Treshawn?

792
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:34,598
Oh come on, Trey. We talked about this.

793
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:36,536
I'm through talking, all right.
Just stay the hell out of my way.

794
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,834
She told me Melissa was with Beth.

795
00:44:37,941 --> 00:44:38,703
So you believe her now?

796
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:40,606
Yeah. I believe what I just saw.

797
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:41,302
What did you see?

798
00:44:41,412 --> 00:44:43,039
I saw that George is still alive.

799
00:44:43,147 --> 00:44:46,412
He's helping one of them.
I think they were shot.

800
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,542
All she wants is to get her children
out safely.

801
00:44:48,652 --> 00:44:51,314
Children? They're monsters.

802
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:53,617
And I'm not going to sit around here
and wait.

803
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:55,353
Let him do it.

804
00:44:55,459 --> 00:44:58,826
If he wants to get himself killed
that's fine.

805
00:44:58,929 --> 00:45:00,794
Let's all just stay the hell
out of his way.

806
00:45:00,898 --> 00:45:03,526
So that's how it's going to be?
Every man for himself?

807
00:45:03,634 --> 00:45:04,362
Yeah.

808
00:45:04,468 --> 00:45:05,867
Fucking asshole.

809
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:46,231
Oh my God!

810
00:45:47,044 --> 00:45:49,535
Hey! There's a woman down here!

811
00:45:49,646 --> 00:45:50,977
Call dispatch!

812
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:52,973
She's alive.

813
00:45:53,217 --> 00:45:54,479
Stay with me. Stay with me!

814
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:57,053
We'll get you help. You stay with me.

815
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:17,599
You okay?

816
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:30,880
Johnny won't make it to Canada.

817
00:46:31,421 --> 00:46:32,911
He won't make it another hour.

818
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:34,489
That's not what mama said.

819
00:46:34,591 --> 00:46:36,183
Yeah well, your mama's wrong.

820
00:46:37,528 --> 00:46:40,019
And believe me, I want to save him
just as badly as you do.

821
00:46:45,202 --> 00:46:46,396
What are these?

822
00:46:46,503 --> 00:46:47,902
They're for my skin.

823
00:46:53,177 --> 00:46:54,838
How long has she had you on these?

824
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:56,203
My whole life.

825
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:57,280
I don't know what they're called.

826
00:46:57,381 --> 00:46:58,712
They're called sugar.

827
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:03,119
I have sensitive skin.

828
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:04,619
You saw a doctor?

829
00:47:06,356 --> 00:47:08,187
No.

830
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:11,294
You ever see a school nurse?

831
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:14,463
Mama taught school at home.

832
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,604
Turn around, Lydia.

833
00:47:24,474 --> 00:47:26,840
Just turn around.

834
00:47:42,392 --> 00:47:45,122
There's nothing wrong with your skin.
Your mother's lying to you.

835
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:46,685
Why would she lie?

836
00:47:46,797 --> 00:47:47,491
Why would she lie?

837
00:47:47,598 --> 00:47:48,189
That's stupid.

838
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:49,560
So you dress like this.

839
00:47:49,666 --> 00:47:52,157
Every inch covered so boys
don't notice you.

840
00:47:53,737 --> 00:47:55,329
So you never leave her.

841
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:01,776
Get out of my way.

842
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:05,608
Lydia, here. Just take mine.

843
00:48:09,253 --> 00:48:10,515
Here.

844
00:48:12,856 --> 00:48:14,289
Thank you.

845
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:23,264
Lydia?

846
00:48:23,367 --> 00:48:24,732
Cover up.

847
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:47,356
I know what you're up to, George.

848
00:48:47,457 --> 00:48:48,890
And it won't work.

849
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:53,893
That girl needs me just
as much as I need her.

850
00:48:54,298 --> 00:48:56,528
It's a cruel world we live in.

851
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,395
Especially for a woman.

852
00:49:01,305 --> 00:49:02,636
And she is not strong enough.

853
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:04,639
That's because...

854
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:06,365
you made her that way.

855
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:24,351
Federal and state authorities have just
released the identities...

856
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:29,091
of the 3 suspects still at large
in the First Omaha Bank robberies.

857
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:33,363
Isaac, Addley, and Jonathan Koffin
are wanted...

858
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:35,404
What are we going to do about this?

859
00:49:35,572 --> 00:49:38,473
Addley Koffin is also wanted
for questioning...

860
00:49:38,575 --> 00:49:40,907
in connection with the rape and murder...

861
00:49:41,011 --> 00:49:43,070
That's a terrible fucking sketch.

862
00:49:44,348 --> 00:49:50,116
The bank robberies began in Tulsa,
Oklahoma in July.

863
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:51,778
There's a fucking cop outside!

864
00:49:54,691 --> 00:49:57,251
You get that head of the household
up here now!

865
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:01,426
All units report your twenty please.

866
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:02,122
Skay at the house.

867
00:50:02,232 --> 00:50:03,927
Oh my God. Guys? Guys!

868
00:50:04,034 --> 00:50:06,264
Trey? Trey!

869
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:11,664
You. Get the fuck up here! Move!

870
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,400
And if any of you make a fucking sound...

871
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,501
I plug the cop and I plug every one
of you bitches.

872
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:17,978
Get over there! This isn’t recess.

873
00:50:31,395 --> 00:50:35,388
You've done a great job so far.
We're almost half way there.

874
00:50:35,499 --> 00:50:37,763
We don't want it to fall apart now.

875
00:50:38,435 --> 00:50:39,629
Stonewall Police.

876
00:50:42,072 --> 00:50:45,235
You and I both want the same thing.

877
00:50:45,342 --> 00:50:49,005
But if he suspects anything,
what we want won't matter anymore.

878
00:50:49,112 --> 00:50:51,945
It will just become a question
of necessity.

879
00:50:56,586 --> 00:50:57,951
Think about Beth.

880
00:50:59,923 --> 00:51:01,220
And that hand.

881
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:03,889
Just keep it behind your back.

882
00:51:14,971 --> 00:51:16,336
Evening. Mr. Sohapi?

883
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:19,432
Yeah.
Sorry about that, I was taking a nap.

884
00:51:19,776 --> 00:51:20,640
Is your wife here with you?

885
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:23,076
My wife's... Yeah, she's... In the shower.

886
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:24,147
What's going on?

887
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:25,077
Sorry to bother you sir.

888
00:51:25,182 --> 00:51:26,274
Have you been watching the news tonight?

889
00:51:26,383 --> 00:51:27,816
Yeah. Tornado.

890
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:31,081
Looks like, uh... Looks like
we're going to get a bad one, huh?

891
00:51:31,188 --> 00:51:32,120
It is, sir.

892
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:34,247
But I was talking about the bank robbers

893
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:36,884
Three men. Brothers, actually.

894
00:51:36,993 --> 00:51:38,984
Wanted for robbing First Omaha Bank.

895
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:40,358
They're on the run.

896
00:51:44,901 --> 00:51:46,835
Well, so what?
You're checking the area?

897
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:49,531
Actually, sir.
The three suspects used to live here.

898
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:50,663
In this neighbourhood?

899
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:51,934
In this house.

900
00:51:53,243 --> 00:51:54,267
In my...

901
00:51:55,378 --> 00:51:58,711
Violent criminals lived in my house?

902
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:03,108
You would think they'd have to
disclose something like that.

903
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:06,018
I'm not sure, sir.
You could check with your attorney.

904
00:52:06,223 --> 00:52:09,056
Have you seen anything unusual tonight?
Had any visitors?

905
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:10,922
No. Normal.

906
00:52:11,661 --> 00:52:14,255
I'm going to be out all night. Close by.

907
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:15,795
If you see anything,
if you need anything.

908
00:52:15,899 --> 00:52:18,891
Okay. Great. Officer Skay. Thank you.

909
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:21,935
You have an accident, sir?

910
00:52:22,572 --> 00:52:23,470
Your forehead.

911
00:52:25,275 --> 00:52:26,970
Yeah, it's, uh...

912
00:52:27,577 --> 00:52:29,477
Basketball. Is it still bleeding?

913
00:52:30,046 --> 00:52:31,206
I'm not very good.

914
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,376
This is going to sound strange.

915
00:52:37,087 --> 00:52:38,782
If someone is here with you...

916
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:42,548
I want you to blink twice.

917
00:52:50,267 --> 00:52:51,859
No, we're good.

918
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:56,334
All right, sir. Thank you.

919
00:52:56,439 --> 00:52:58,236
Yeah. Thank you.

920
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:08,415
Shit. He's getting back in his car.

921
00:53:08,785 --> 00:53:09,877
What's he doing?

922
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,178
Where's he going?

923
00:53:23,133 --> 00:53:24,828
What was I supposed to do?

924
00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:29,906
If any of us die tonight...

925
00:53:30,507 --> 00:53:32,031
it's on you.

926
00:53:43,853 --> 00:53:46,515
That was too close.

927
00:53:46,957 --> 00:53:47,685
What are you looking for?

928
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:50,123
Our money. They're hiding it.

929
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:52,092
That guy is too good of a liar.

930
00:53:52,195 --> 00:53:53,662
You go downstairs. Check his office.

931
00:53:53,763 --> 00:53:55,958
Check for any little thing.
- Okay.

932
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:02,102
You're okay.

933
00:54:09,212 --> 00:54:10,975
Why are you doing this to us?

934
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:13,379
To you?

935
00:54:13,683 --> 00:54:15,480
It's got nothing to do with you.

936
00:54:16,486 --> 00:54:18,283
We had to get Johnny home to mother.

937
00:54:18,388 --> 00:54:20,288
Well, how could you not know that
she moved?

938
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:22,654
Something bad happened.
We had to leave town for a while.

939
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:24,317
She couldn't contact us.

940
00:54:25,328 --> 00:54:28,889
Guess you just moved into
the wrong house.

941
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:35,297
We got a real problem here.

942
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:37,607
How much more do you need?

943
00:54:37,707 --> 00:54:39,937
How much more can you get in 20 minutes?

944
00:54:42,145 --> 00:54:45,672
Treshawn runs a dry cleaning
business downtown.

945
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:47,340
I don't need my pants pressed, Beth.

946
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:49,350
It's a cash business.

947
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:55,389
That's you, Smokey.

948
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:01,195
Yeah.

949
00:55:01,498 --> 00:55:02,590
Trey, it's me.

950
00:55:03,433 --> 00:55:04,365
Beth?

951
00:55:05,368 --> 00:55:06,392
Are you okay?

952
00:55:06,503 --> 00:55:09,063
We're going to the store.
I need the code for the alarm.

953
00:55:09,172 --> 00:55:10,730
Why are you going to my store?

954
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:12,432
We need more money, Trey.

955
00:55:12,676 --> 00:55:15,144
What's the combination to the safe?

956
00:55:17,213 --> 00:55:18,043
2...

957
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:19,672
15...

958
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:23,179
22-67-0.

959
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:25,778
Is everything in there?

960
00:55:26,056 --> 00:55:26,715
What do you mean?

961
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:28,723
I mean is there another safe.

962
00:55:28,958 --> 00:55:30,550
No, that's the only one.

963
00:55:31,561 --> 00:55:33,188
Listen to me, Treshawn.

964
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:37,827
I need to give him everything he needs
so we can be done with this.

965
00:55:38,468 --> 00:55:39,958
Do you understand?

966
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:42,237
Desk drawer, bottom right.

967
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:43,738
Listen, Beth...

968
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,537
be careful.

969
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:47,542
You, too.

970
00:55:49,612 --> 00:55:52,410
There's only one safe.
But there's plenty in it.

971
00:55:53,149 --> 00:55:54,673
Make a right on Main.

972
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:03,315
He isn’t looking too fucking good, doc.

973
00:56:03,426 --> 00:56:04,393
I'm doing my best.

974
00:56:04,494 --> 00:56:05,893
Well, do a fucking better job!

975
00:56:05,995 --> 00:56:07,257
For everybody's sake.

976
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:08,888
Can I please get cleaned up.

977
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:16,200
I didn't do anything.

978
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:21,936
I've never had a woman before,
and I'm going to die.

979
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:23,535
Is that what you want?

980
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:34,322
What are you doing?

981
00:56:37,293 --> 00:56:38,590
Nothing.

982
00:56:39,129 --> 00:56:40,824
Johnny needs a new shirt.

983
00:56:44,134 --> 00:56:45,294
Okay.

984
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:48,997
So tell me about Queenie.

985
00:56:54,144 --> 00:56:56,271
She lives in the woods behind the house.

986
00:56:57,180 --> 00:57:00,479
And she punishes children who are bad.

987
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:02,551
That's what mama says anyway.

988
00:57:02,652 --> 00:57:03,641
Do you believe her?

989
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:05,618
Not since I was small.

990
00:57:07,557 --> 00:57:09,821
But sometimes I still think I hear her.

991
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:11,985
There's nobody out there, Lydia.

992
00:57:12,662 --> 00:57:14,630
It's your mother trying to scare you.

993
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:17,964
I know.

994
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:21,898
I'm just trying to tell you this night
is going to end, okay?

995
00:57:22,305 --> 00:57:25,365
We're going to go back to our palatial
one-bedroom apartment.

996
00:57:25,475 --> 00:57:28,410
You're going to put on that sexy black
cocktail dress.

997
00:57:28,511 --> 00:57:31,173
You know, the one we can never
find the right occasion for.

998
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:32,915
And we're going to light some candles.

999
00:57:33,016 --> 00:57:36,247
We're going to play some Marvin Gaye.

1000
00:57:36,586 --> 00:57:39,384
We're going to dance close and slow...

1001
00:57:39,489 --> 00:57:42,083
while this tornado tears up
this damn county, okay?

1002
00:57:43,526 --> 00:57:44,720
Okay?

1003
00:57:54,604 --> 00:57:56,538
I've been on pussy patrol.

1004
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:58,702
Which means...

1005
00:58:01,578 --> 00:58:03,443
One of you lucky bitches...

1006
00:58:03,947 --> 00:58:07,348
are going to come with me upstairs
and pop my brother's cherry.

1007
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:09,541
And since I'm such a giving mood...

1008
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:11,677
and this is a special occasion.

1009
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:18,218
I'm going to let you all decide.

1010
00:58:18,895 --> 00:58:20,362
You can't be serious.

1011
00:58:20,797 --> 00:58:23,027
I'm serious as a God damn lynch mob.

1012
00:58:24,601 --> 00:58:26,296
But time is running out so...

1013
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:30,666
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock.

1014
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:32,971
I need you all to make a decision.

1015
00:58:33,443 --> 00:58:35,775
I'm trying to be nice about this.

1016
00:58:40,483 --> 00:58:42,075
With the winner chicken dinner.

1017
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:44,745
No! Please, no.

1018
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:53,661
You just plug up there
or I'll plug you down here.

1019
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:57,522
Daniel!

1020
00:58:57,934 --> 00:58:59,526
Daniel!

1021
00:59:11,281 --> 00:59:14,682
Are we just going to sit here
and let them take us one-by-one, huh?

1022
00:59:16,252 --> 00:59:18,982
Danny?
- I don't know what to do. Trey.

1023
00:59:19,088 --> 00:59:20,885
I don't know what to do.

1024
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:22,150
I know what to do.

1025
00:59:22,258 --> 00:59:23,555
Baby, please!

1026
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:25,355
I'm going to show you what to do.

1027
00:59:26,195 --> 00:59:29,323
No, no, no.
This one is not worthy of my son.

1028
00:59:41,644 --> 00:59:44,977
You've got a nice strong man there.

1029
00:59:49,285 --> 00:59:50,343
Any children?

1030
00:59:50,453 --> 00:59:51,613
No, not yet.

1031
00:59:52,288 --> 00:59:57,316
I wouldn't wait much longer.
It'll age you quicker than drugs.

1032
01:00:01,364 --> 01:00:02,558
She's worthy.

1033
01:00:02,665 --> 01:00:03,290
No.

1034
01:00:03,399 --> 01:00:05,799
Wait! You need money.
He works for a bank.

1035
01:00:05,902 --> 01:00:06,527
You bitch.

1036
01:00:06,636 --> 01:00:09,833
He writes mortgages.
People pay in cashier's checks.

1037
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:11,736
He wrote one for Trey.

1038
01:00:11,841 --> 01:00:14,036
God defend me from my friends.

1039
01:00:14,143 --> 01:00:16,771
My enemies I can handle on my own.

1040
01:00:17,513 --> 01:00:18,502
He's not our friend.

1041
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:19,843
You fucking bitch!

1042
01:00:20,016 --> 01:00:22,814
Ooh, he's a fiery one, huh?

1043
01:00:23,586 --> 01:00:26,953
Well, obviously,
you two have something to work out.

1044
01:00:27,256 --> 01:00:32,990
And whoever loses,
his woman will come upstairs with me.

1045
01:00:39,769 --> 01:00:43,261
Then get this started
or I will take them both.

1046
01:00:44,574 --> 01:00:47,304
No, no, no, please,
I don't want to do this. Please.

1047
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:49,742
And I didn't even eat any of the cake.

1048
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:53,740
You know what? Perfect music.

1049
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:57,115
Music will set the mood.
That's looking good.

1050
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:35,347
Come on, mama, let's cut a rug!

1051
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:45,265
Fuck him up!

1052
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:57,346
Knock his fucking head off!

1053
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,006
Finish.

1054
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:06,214
Lydia, I want you to listen me
for a minute.

1055
01:02:06,622 --> 01:02:07,816
When the police show up...

1056
01:02:07,924 --> 01:02:11,189
you're going to be considered an accomplice
You'll go to jail.

1057
01:02:12,261 --> 01:02:14,729
This is your chance.
You don't have to be like them.

1058
01:02:14,931 --> 01:02:17,024
You don't know the first thing
about my family.

1059
01:02:18,768 --> 01:02:20,599
You're supposed to be keeping him awake.

1060
01:02:20,837 --> 01:02:21,929
Get up.

1061
01:02:25,174 --> 01:02:26,232
He's not breathing.

1062
01:02:26,342 --> 01:02:27,468
He's gone.

1063
01:02:28,277 --> 01:02:29,039
Save my brother.

1064
01:02:29,145 --> 01:02:30,203
Lydia, he's dead.

1065
01:02:30,313 --> 01:02:32,110
You will save him!

1066
01:02:37,653 --> 01:02:39,382
This isn't going to work. He's gone.

1067
01:02:39,489 --> 01:02:42,925
Oh, God, Johnny! Johnny, come on.

1068
01:02:43,025 --> 01:02:45,255
You're not going to believe what mama
just did!

1069
01:02:47,497 --> 01:02:50,193
What the fuck is this shit?

1070
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:00,834
Out of curiosity...

1071
01:03:00,943 --> 01:03:04,208
how long has it been going on
between the two of you?

1072
01:03:08,317 --> 01:03:11,218
What else have you been keeping
from your wife?

1073
01:03:12,722 --> 01:03:13,484
Mama!

1074
01:03:13,589 --> 01:03:14,817
Something's up.

1075
01:03:19,996 --> 01:03:20,587
What's wrong?

1076
01:03:20,696 --> 01:03:22,254
It's okay. He's just dehydrated.

1077
01:03:22,365 --> 01:03:24,026
Mama's got a surprise for you.

1078
01:03:27,069 --> 01:03:28,195
Sit!

1079
01:03:28,938 --> 01:03:30,098
Mama?

1080
01:03:30,673 --> 01:03:32,732
I thought you said it would always
be the woman's choice.

1081
01:03:32,842 --> 01:03:34,673
This is the woman's choice, Lydia.

1082
01:03:34,777 --> 01:03:35,903
Mine.

1083
01:03:37,013 --> 01:03:38,981
No, mama! That's too far!

1084
01:03:42,084 --> 01:03:45,247
These people do not deserve
your compassion, Lydia.

1085
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:48,655
They've been lying to us
from the moment we got here.

1086
01:03:48,758 --> 01:03:51,921
They are hiding our money
in this house.

1087
01:03:52,028 --> 01:03:54,895
And I am going to find it.

1088
01:04:07,076 --> 01:04:08,373
What are these numbers?

1089
01:04:23,092 --> 01:04:24,719
The numbers? Tell me again.

1090
01:04:44,747 --> 01:04:46,647
You're fucking with me.
Aren't you, Beth?

1091
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:51,410
One more time. Get it right.

1092
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,488
What are the fucking numbers?

1093
01:05:20,182 --> 01:05:21,911
We are in business.

1094
01:05:23,552 --> 01:05:24,610
Nice.

1095
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:25,812
Well done, Beth.

1096
01:05:29,191 --> 01:05:30,590
Cell phone.

1097
01:05:32,461 --> 01:05:34,361
You don't even know how to hold
that thing.

1098
01:05:35,064 --> 01:05:36,224
Cell phone.

1099
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:53,146
Help! Help!

1100
01:05:59,488 --> 01:06:01,012
Damn it, Beth!

1101
01:06:03,592 --> 01:06:04,820
You tried.

1102
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:06,522
I respect that.

1103
01:06:07,496 --> 01:06:10,863
Don't make me fucking look for you.

1104
01:06:12,702 --> 01:06:13,862
You make this nice and easy on me...

1105
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:15,870
I'll make it quick and easy on you.

1106
01:06:17,406 --> 01:06:18,964
You've reached emergency services.

1107
01:06:19,075 --> 01:06:20,167
Beth!

1108
01:06:25,614 --> 01:06:28,742
Olly olly oxen free! You stupid bitch!

1109
01:06:34,457 --> 01:06:35,719
Beth!

1110
01:06:37,059 --> 01:06:38,390
Come on, now.

1111
01:06:58,080 --> 01:06:58,409
911.

1112
01:06:58,514 --> 01:07:02,416
Hello, operator. Hello, hello.

1113
01:07:02,918 --> 01:07:04,112
Ma'am...

1114
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:16,227
Put your hair down.

1115
01:07:16,332 --> 01:07:17,856
Make yourself look sweet.

1116
01:07:23,506 --> 01:07:27,033
I told everyone down there
that you weren't going to hurt us.

1117
01:07:32,648 --> 01:07:35,776
I actually believed you.

1118
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:38,245
This is not fair.

1119
01:07:38,354 --> 01:07:41,812
Please don't this to me, please don't.

1120
01:07:41,924 --> 01:07:43,323
It's not fair.

1121
01:07:43,993 --> 01:07:46,223
Life isn't always fair, my dear.

1122
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:49,561
Hasn't been fair to me either.

1123
01:07:56,472 --> 01:07:58,064
Ready, Johnny?

1124
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:07,013
How's that for a transformation?

1125
01:08:09,151 --> 01:08:10,880
No.

1126
01:08:10,986 --> 01:08:13,614
No, he cannot do this in his condition.
It's dangerous.

1127
01:08:13,722 --> 01:08:14,689
Lydia.

1128
01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:15,950
Take doc to the kitchen.

1129
01:08:16,058 --> 01:08:18,151
This is a private show for my boy.

1130
01:08:19,228 --> 01:08:20,422
Lydia?

1131
01:08:28,904 --> 01:08:30,599
No! Okay.

1132
01:08:32,341 --> 01:08:34,070
Just trust me.

1133
01:08:36,979 --> 01:08:38,606
I'm so sorry.

1134
01:08:43,919 --> 01:08:45,511
You're something else.

1135
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:02,400
I'm begging you.

1136
01:09:02,505 --> 01:09:05,497
Oh, stop your whining and do
what you know how to do.

1137
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:08,769
I can't.

1138
01:09:16,519 --> 01:09:17,850
Johnny...

1139
01:09:17,953 --> 01:09:20,649
you've made your mother very proud.

1140
01:09:20,756 --> 01:09:22,053
I love you.

1141
01:09:23,492 --> 01:09:24,754
I love you.

1142
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:29,055
Now dance for him, dear.

1143
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,525
Come on, take the dress off.

1144
01:09:50,819 --> 01:09:51,478
Come on, Dave.

1145
01:09:51,587 --> 01:09:52,815
It's true, isn't it?

1146
01:09:52,922 --> 01:09:54,184
Beth was right.

1147
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:58,118
Say it.

1148
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:01,454
Daniel and I are having an affair.

1149
01:10:01,564 --> 01:10:03,156
Julie!

1150
01:10:03,332 --> 01:10:06,358
She knew something was going on.
She just didn't know who with.

1151
01:10:07,236 --> 01:10:08,430
She knows.

1152
01:10:09,004 --> 01:10:10,699
And after everything she's been through.

1153
01:10:10,806 --> 01:10:12,535
We both lost a child!

1154
01:10:12,641 --> 01:10:13,835
You think you know pain?

1155
01:10:13,943 --> 01:10:16,343
None of this matters right now. Okay?

1156
01:10:20,449 --> 01:10:25,148
My fianc? Is upstairs
with those animals right now.

1157
01:10:28,924 --> 01:10:31,358
The only thing that matters
is us getting out of here.

1158
01:10:31,527 --> 01:10:32,585
Now.

1159
01:10:39,335 --> 01:10:43,066
Let him see you.

1160
01:10:58,687 --> 01:11:00,245
Baby!

1161
01:11:03,892 --> 01:11:05,382
Doc! Get in here now!

1162
01:11:05,494 --> 01:11:07,018
Help me.

1163
01:11:09,598 --> 01:11:11,657
The green box. Open it.

1164
01:11:17,506 --> 01:11:17,972
They're coming!

1165
01:11:18,073 --> 01:11:20,564
I know you can hear me coming down
these steps motherfuckers.

1166
01:11:20,676 --> 01:11:23,076
Get your faces down on the fucking floor
right now!

1167
01:11:23,178 --> 01:11:24,270
What's going on?

1168
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:27,645
A group therapy session.
Get the fuck on the floor!

1169
01:11:28,183 --> 01:11:29,445
Get on the floor!

1170
01:11:29,551 --> 01:11:30,984
I'm devastated.

1171
01:11:31,086 --> 01:11:33,111
Bitch couldn't get my brother's
dick hard.

1172
01:11:33,889 --> 01:11:36,050
But she's doing wonders for mine.

1173
01:11:36,759 --> 01:11:38,488
You perverted piece of shit!

1174
01:11:42,031 --> 01:11:44,966
Get off!

1175
01:11:46,535 --> 01:11:49,333
Get off!

1176
01:11:49,438 --> 01:11:50,837
Back up!

1177
01:12:04,753 --> 01:12:07,620
I'm so sorry. I did not mean to do that.

1178
01:12:08,724 --> 01:12:13,491
No! No!

1179
01:12:13,595 --> 01:12:16,359
Addley, can't I leave you alone
five minutes?

1180
01:12:16,465 --> 01:12:19,696
Every time I turn my head,
you make a mess.

1181
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:43,181
You have exactly 3 minutes to get
that person back in this house.

1182
01:12:43,292 --> 01:12:48,855
Or your snivelling little weasel
of a wife is going to get hurt.

1183
01:12:49,131 --> 01:12:53,534
Danny, don't do it. Don't do it.
Don't do it. Please.

1184
01:12:53,635 --> 01:12:55,569
You have two minutes forty-five seconds.

1185
01:12:58,307 --> 01:12:59,672
Danny!

1186
01:13:00,876 --> 01:13:01,968
Danny!

1187
01:13:08,817 --> 01:13:10,842
Help!

1188
01:13:12,187 --> 01:13:13,916
Help!

1189
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:17,018
Open the door!

1190
01:13:17,493 --> 01:13:18,551
Gina!

1191
01:13:21,330 --> 01:13:23,491
Gina!

1192
01:13:23,599 --> 01:13:25,464
You got to go back! You got to go back!

1193
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:27,194
No, no, no!
We made it out. We can go get help.

1194
01:13:27,302 --> 01:13:29,497
No! She's going to start killing us.

1195
01:13:29,605 --> 01:13:30,765
You have to come back with me.

1196
01:13:30,873 --> 01:13:33,103
Daniel! Not all of us are going to make it.

1197
01:13:33,208 --> 01:13:35,073
That's just a fact.

1198
01:13:35,177 --> 01:13:37,839
If you want to live, come with me, okay?

1199
01:13:37,946 --> 01:13:40,710
We can't let these bastards get away
with this. Come on!

1200
01:13:40,816 --> 01:13:42,374
I can't!

1201
01:13:42,484 --> 01:13:44,213
Please, just come with me.
- No time! I can't!

1202
01:13:44,319 --> 01:13:47,413
Motherfucker, get your hands off me! No!

1203
01:13:47,890 --> 01:13:50,120
Gina!

1204
01:13:54,263 --> 01:14:00,532
Stop! Wait!

1205
01:14:18,921 --> 01:14:21,219
No, no, no.

1206
01:14:21,323 --> 01:14:22,312
Shit.

1207
01:14:30,499 --> 01:14:32,023
Don't make me kill this guy.

1208
01:14:33,402 --> 01:14:34,494
Okay?

1209
01:14:40,209 --> 01:14:41,039
You folks have got to get off the road.

1210
01:14:41,143 --> 01:14:42,633
That tornado could touch down
any second.

1211
01:14:42,744 --> 01:14:43,768
We're trying officer.

1212
01:14:43,879 --> 01:14:45,369
We're just on our way right now.

1213
01:14:46,048 --> 01:14:46,946
You folks have far to go?

1214
01:14:47,049 --> 01:14:48,949
A couple of miles. Denny Avenue.

1215
01:14:49,117 --> 01:14:50,106
Nice street.

1216
01:14:50,953 --> 01:14:51,977
Got your ID?

1217
01:14:54,122 --> 01:14:56,454
My orders are to escort anyone
to the shelter on Elm St.

1218
01:14:56,558 --> 01:14:58,321
If you live that close,
I'll let you slide.

1219
01:14:58,427 --> 01:14:59,792
I just need to check.

1220
01:14:59,895 --> 01:15:02,887
My husband and I don't have our license.

1221
01:15:02,998 --> 01:15:03,987
I hope that'll do.

1222
01:15:04,099 --> 01:15:05,498
No problem, ma'am.

1223
01:15:09,238 --> 01:15:13,675
We just went out for water
and batteries for the storm.

1224
01:15:14,276 --> 01:15:16,073
Good thinking, Mrs. Sohapi.

1225
01:15:16,745 --> 01:15:18,372
You be careful out there.

1226
01:15:18,614 --> 01:15:20,081
You'd be Mr. Sohapi.

1227
01:15:20,315 --> 01:15:21,942
Yeah, I'm very happy.

1228
01:15:22,417 --> 01:15:24,180
Yeah, I'm Mr. Sohapi.

1229
01:15:24,553 --> 01:15:25,520
Right.

1230
01:15:26,722 --> 01:15:29,088
Sir, could you roll up your window
and turn your vehicle off?

1231
01:15:29,658 --> 01:15:30,955
I'll be right back.

1232
01:15:39,468 --> 01:15:40,935
Stay in the car.

1233
01:15:45,774 --> 01:15:46,900
Sir, please stay in your vehicle.

1234
01:15:47,009 --> 01:15:48,806
I just have a couple of questions
for you.

1235
01:15:48,911 --> 01:15:50,879
Please get back your vehicle!

1236
01:15:54,583 --> 01:15:56,016
Down on the ground now!

1237
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:13,864
Move over. You're driving.

1238
01:16:26,848 --> 01:16:28,315
You've got to be kidding me.

1239
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:32,651
Run him down.

1240
01:16:37,225 --> 01:16:41,355
Mother's going to be very unhappy
with your lack of listening skills.

1241
01:16:41,463 --> 01:16:44,523
It's that man or it's you
and your friends.

1242
01:16:46,702 --> 01:16:47,896
Fine.

1243
01:16:49,438 --> 01:16:51,963
I'm starting to gain rapport
with you and I, Beth.

1244
01:16:52,574 --> 01:16:54,064
That's a good wife.

1245
01:17:15,697 --> 01:17:18,530
Oh, good. You're awake.

1246
01:17:19,201 --> 01:17:21,863
You don't know how lucky you are...

1247
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:24,632
running around in the middle
of the night.

1248
01:17:25,207 --> 01:17:27,573
Be grateful Queenie didn't get you.

1249
01:17:30,812 --> 01:17:31,836
Mama.

1250
01:17:32,614 --> 01:17:33,638
Thank you.

1251
01:17:36,451 --> 01:17:37,475
My dear.

1252
01:17:39,354 --> 01:17:40,878
You didn't listen.

1253
01:17:44,693 --> 01:17:46,957
When my children were growing up...

1254
01:17:48,130 --> 01:17:50,257
they occasionally misbehaved.

1255
01:17:50,365 --> 01:17:53,357
What child doesn't, after all.

1256
01:17:53,735 --> 01:17:59,696
But I taught them that their behaviour
had consequences...

1257
01:17:59,975 --> 01:18:05,038
not just for themselves but also
for their brothers and sister.

1258
01:18:07,549 --> 01:18:09,141
I'm really sorry.

1259
01:18:09,584 --> 01:18:10,949
You'll see.

1260
01:18:11,053 --> 01:18:12,748
If you ever become a mother.

1261
01:18:13,889 --> 01:18:15,516
Punishment...

1262
01:18:17,325 --> 01:18:20,123
is never easy.

1263
01:18:20,929 --> 01:18:28,267
But if you want them to understand
and respect the rules...

1264
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:30,463
you can never back down.

1265
01:18:30,572 --> 01:18:35,475
You see, rules are what make order
out of chaos.

1266
01:18:35,577 --> 01:18:39,308
We must follow the rules.

1267
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:43,108
I'm really sorry.

1268
01:18:45,787 --> 01:18:47,277
Baby!

1269
01:18:56,898 --> 01:18:57,956
What's he doing?

1270
01:18:58,066 --> 01:19:03,265
What's the point in having ears
if you're not going to listen?

1271
01:19:09,211 --> 01:19:10,303
Stop it!

1272
01:19:17,018 --> 01:19:18,952
Please, stop it.

1273
01:19:34,136 --> 01:19:35,626
No.

1274
01:19:36,371 --> 01:19:38,032
That's enough.

1275
01:19:44,146 --> 01:19:46,171
Don't worry, my dear...

1276
01:19:47,048 --> 01:19:49,209
he still loves you.

1277
01:19:59,594 --> 01:20:00,583
Ma'am!

1278
01:20:05,667 --> 01:20:06,964
Ma'am!

1279
01:20:07,969 --> 01:20:09,368
Are you all right?

1280
01:20:09,738 --> 01:20:12,104
Help me! Please help me

1281
01:20:12,207 --> 01:20:13,868
What about the man with you?

1282
01:20:13,975 --> 01:20:15,237
He's not moving.

1283
01:20:15,510 --> 01:20:16,807
He's not moving.

1284
01:20:17,979 --> 01:20:19,310
I'm going to get some help.

1285
01:20:41,336 --> 01:20:44,362
Is that your little Jake's?

1286
01:20:47,876 --> 01:20:49,810
Now it's time for show and tell.

1287
01:20:49,911 --> 01:20:53,176
I am going to show and you
are going to tell.

1288
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:57,910
You loved your little boy, didn't you?

1289
01:20:59,254 --> 01:21:00,949
Was he the light of your life?

1290
01:21:01,323 --> 01:21:03,086
The apple of your eye?

1291
01:21:03,992 --> 01:21:06,290
Was he the best thing that
ever happened to you?

1292
01:21:08,964 --> 01:21:11,023
Did you see yourself in him?

1293
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:15,335
The smile and his laugh.

1294
01:21:15,937 --> 01:21:17,996
What a beautiful child.

1295
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:20,339
Such a shame.

1296
01:21:20,909 --> 01:21:23,969
You must have relived that moment
a million times.

1297
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:27,610
And you looked away.

1298
01:21:27,716 --> 01:21:30,150
And he ran out into the street.

1299
01:21:34,022 --> 01:21:36,991
What he must have looked like
in his little coffin.

1300
01:21:37,993 --> 01:21:40,985
His future snuffed out like a candle.

1301
01:21:42,397 --> 01:21:45,161
And all because of you.

1302
01:21:52,674 --> 01:21:56,201
If only you'd paid more attention.

1303
01:21:56,311 --> 01:21:58,370
He'd be here now, wouldn't he?

1304
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:01,881
Alive and snug up in his bed.

1305
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:05,280
Now's your chance to be a man...

1306
01:22:05,387 --> 01:22:08,914
and honour the memory of your little boy.

1307
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:10,548
Where's my money?

1308
01:22:10,892 --> 01:22:11,950
Look.

1309
01:22:15,196 --> 01:22:17,460
Tell the truth. Where's the money?

1310
01:22:17,565 --> 01:22:20,398
There's no money! No money!

1311
01:22:20,502 --> 01:22:21,799
Where's our money?

1312
01:22:21,903 --> 01:22:23,564
There's no money.

1313
01:22:23,672 --> 01:22:25,196
Oh, there's no money.

1314
01:22:26,374 --> 01:22:31,107
Don't do that! Please, don't do that!

1315
01:22:39,454 --> 01:22:40,386
Are you sure you didn't hide it...

1316
01:22:40,488 --> 01:22:42,547
so you could run away with your
little floozy?

1317
01:22:42,657 --> 01:22:44,750
Don't do that.

1318
01:22:44,926 --> 01:22:47,417
What does that woman mean to you?

1319
01:22:47,896 --> 01:22:48,885
Do it.

1320
01:22:50,332 --> 01:22:52,391
No man is going to want you now.

1321
01:22:55,837 --> 01:23:08,113
No, no! No! No!

1322
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:47,579
Let that be a lesson to all of us.

1323
01:23:47,756 --> 01:23:51,624
Marriage is sacred.

1324
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:53,559
Come on, Addley.

1325
01:24:02,904 --> 01:24:04,701
Was I wrong about her?

1326
01:25:22,417 --> 01:25:24,385
Stay calm. We're going to help you.

1327
01:25:40,768 --> 01:25:42,099
Send Help

1328
01:25:42,871 --> 01:25:44,338
Get the police in here.

1329
01:25:44,539 --> 01:25:45,563
Now.

1330
01:26:01,923 --> 01:26:05,984
The gold box!
George said open the gold box.!

1331
01:26:18,072 --> 01:26:24,671
I was right!

1332
01:26:37,725 --> 01:26:39,158
Addley!

1333
01:26:40,628 --> 01:26:43,222
Bring Daniel upstairs.

1334
01:28:21,596 --> 01:28:24,030
Gina, Gina, Gina.

1335
01:28:25,333 --> 01:28:31,431
Oh my God, Gina! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1336
01:29:10,378 --> 01:29:11,606
Give me Beth.

1337
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:14,471
You want to talk to your wife?

1338
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:26,824
Beth.

1339
01:29:26,928 --> 01:29:28,486
Beth?

1340
01:29:28,763 --> 01:29:30,060
It's okay.

1341
01:29:31,666 --> 01:29:32,598
Remember?

1342
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:37,433
"Always and forever. "
Remember that stupid song?

1343
01:29:37,538 --> 01:29:38,664
Remember?

1344
01:29:38,773 --> 01:29:40,764
I love you, Daniel.

1345
01:29:42,343 --> 01:29:45,141
You know how much I love you.

1346
01:29:46,647 --> 01:29:48,740
I'm so sorry.

1347
01:30:05,633 --> 01:30:07,567
Bring me that phone.

1348
01:30:18,279 --> 01:30:20,270
They killed Addely.

1349
01:30:21,416 --> 01:30:23,543
They killed your little brother.

1350
01:30:25,119 --> 01:30:30,079
Bring Beth to me.

1351
01:30:44,305 --> 01:30:46,273
I love you.

1352
01:30:57,318 --> 01:30:59,309
You like them dependent, don't you?

1353
01:31:00,321 --> 01:31:02,186
They never saw a doctor.

1354
01:31:02,557 --> 01:31:04,354
They never went to school.

1355
01:31:05,359 --> 01:31:06,485
George?

1356
01:31:08,095 --> 01:31:09,426
And Queenie.

1357
01:31:09,530 --> 01:31:11,794
Just another story to scare your kids.

1358
01:31:13,568 --> 01:31:15,695
I get it. I see now. You're afraid.

1359
01:31:16,070 --> 01:31:17,094
You're afraid they're going to leave you...

1360
01:31:17,205 --> 01:31:19,435
so you hobble them before they can run.

1361
01:31:19,807 --> 01:31:20,865
George?

1362
01:31:21,943 --> 01:31:24,138
You know, none of them look like you.

1363
01:31:25,746 --> 01:31:27,373
And they don't look alike.

1364
01:31:27,548 --> 01:31:28,742
They're not even your kids.

1365
01:31:28,850 --> 01:31:32,251
Those children are mine!

1366
01:31:32,386 --> 01:31:35,014
You have no idea what I've been
through for them.

1367
01:31:35,122 --> 01:31:38,114
You're infertile.

1368
01:31:38,226 --> 01:31:40,194
They mean everything to me!

1369
01:31:40,394 --> 01:31:42,362
Mama! Stop!

1370
01:31:42,463 --> 01:31:43,395
We need him.

1371
01:31:43,498 --> 01:31:44,556
No, I don't need him.

1372
01:31:44,665 --> 01:31:47,566
I can take care of Johnny.
- No, mama, you can't.

1373
01:31:47,668 --> 01:31:49,533
We've already lost Addely.

1374
01:31:49,937 --> 01:31:51,461
Isn't one enough?

1375
01:32:01,115 --> 01:32:02,173
Mama!

1376
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:13,652
Where is he?

1377
01:32:13,761 --> 01:32:15,160
The basement.

1378
01:32:20,001 --> 01:32:22,526
No use crying over split milk.

1379
01:32:23,070 --> 01:32:25,231
Or the husband who betrayed you.

1380
01:32:26,407 --> 01:32:27,533
You...

1381
01:32:28,109 --> 01:32:30,043
You killed my husband.

1382
01:32:42,323 --> 01:32:44,757
It's going to be okay.

1383
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:47,352
They had the money.

1384
01:32:48,863 --> 01:32:53,323
Help George and Lydia and get Johnny
in the Winnebago...

1385
01:32:53,434 --> 01:32:56,631
cause I have something to discuss
with these ladies.

1386
01:32:56,871 --> 01:32:58,168
Yes, mama.

1387
01:32:59,974 --> 01:33:01,999
Ike, what happened to Addley?

1388
01:33:16,490 --> 01:33:18,822
Get him on his back.
We got to get him on his back.

1389
01:33:19,160 --> 01:33:22,994
Keep him propped up. Keep him quiet.

1390
01:33:24,298 --> 01:33:26,994
We've been through a hell of a night...
haven't we ladies?

1391
01:33:27,535 --> 01:33:28,866
You know what the real tragedy is?

1392
01:33:28,936 --> 01:33:30,563
It didn't have to happen this way.

1393
01:33:30,738 --> 01:33:32,296
Nobody had to get hurt.

1394
01:33:32,940 --> 01:33:34,498
Nobody had to die.

1395
01:33:34,709 --> 01:33:36,438
Everything that happened...

1396
01:33:36,544 --> 01:33:38,011
was the result...

1397
01:33:39,447 --> 01:33:42,541
of your lie.

1398
01:33:43,017 --> 01:33:44,177
The money...

1399
01:33:45,286 --> 01:33:47,220
she said wasn't here in the house...

1400
01:33:47,321 --> 01:33:50,984
was hidden behind the picture
in the bathroom.

1401
01:33:51,092 --> 01:33:55,392
In the very envelopes addressed to me.

1402
01:33:55,896 --> 01:33:57,022
Whose name is that?

1403
01:33:57,131 --> 01:33:58,428
Is that your name?

1404
01:33:59,233 --> 01:34:01,929
Your fianc? Your friends...

1405
01:34:02,036 --> 01:34:04,971
she may not have pulled the trigger,
but...

1406
01:34:06,207 --> 01:34:09,142
she's responsible for their deaths.

1407
01:34:09,243 --> 01:34:11,643
She's lying.
- Their blood is on your hands.

1408
01:34:11,746 --> 01:34:12,804
I was buying us time.

1409
01:34:12,913 --> 01:34:13,277
Liar.

1410
01:34:13,381 --> 01:34:15,178
If I had told her I had the money
she would have killed us.

1411
01:34:15,282 --> 01:34:15,714
Liar!

1412
01:34:15,816 --> 01:34:17,807
We had seen her children
and we could ID them.

1413
01:34:17,918 --> 01:34:18,543
Liar.

1414
01:34:18,653 --> 01:34:19,915
She would do anything for them.

1415
01:34:20,021 --> 01:34:23,320
I just want to know one thing. Why?

1416
01:34:23,858 --> 01:34:27,726
Why did you lie to your husband, Beth?

1417
01:34:27,828 --> 01:34:31,491
Why did you lie to your friends, Beth?

1418
01:34:31,832 --> 01:34:35,666
Beth. Why did you let innocent
people die, Beth?

1419
01:34:35,770 --> 01:34:37,032
My baby.

1420
01:34:37,772 --> 01:34:39,501
I did it for my baby.

1421
01:34:39,607 --> 01:34:42,667
You baby's dead!

1422
01:34:49,817 --> 01:34:51,512
You're pregnant.

1423
01:34:52,486 --> 01:34:53,453
Doc.

1424
01:34:59,927 --> 01:35:01,827
Lydia, I need you to step outside now.

1425
01:35:01,929 --> 01:35:04,329
No. Ike, he's coming with us.

1426
01:35:04,432 --> 01:35:06,024
Ike.

1427
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:08,397
Mama said, Ike.

1428
01:35:09,170 --> 01:35:10,569
Please.

1429
01:35:10,671 --> 01:35:12,104
Please.

1430
01:35:17,745 --> 01:35:19,337
Thank you.

1431
01:35:25,219 --> 01:35:28,677
I kept the money so that
I could get away.

1432
01:35:28,789 --> 01:35:30,882
I just wanted a new life for me...

1433
01:35:31,258 --> 01:35:32,850
and for my baby.

1434
01:35:33,894 --> 01:35:35,987
I knew that he was cheating.

1435
01:35:37,898 --> 01:35:39,388
Prove it.

1436
01:35:51,479 --> 01:35:55,108
Mama said no loose ends.
I'm doing good, all right?

1437
01:35:55,216 --> 01:35:57,377
I know. - That was good.

1438
01:36:32,553 --> 01:36:36,319
What a gift you have inside your belly.

1439
01:36:36,757 --> 01:36:38,349
The gift if life.

1440
01:36:39,326 --> 01:36:43,422
A gift some take for granted.
But it's a miracle.

1441
01:36:44,498 --> 01:36:46,022
A miracle.

1442
01:36:47,201 --> 01:36:48,600
Wipe.

1443
01:36:49,270 --> 01:36:50,601
It's a tiny life.

1444
01:36:50,704 --> 01:36:53,468
Created by you. Of you.

1445
01:36:53,574 --> 01:36:55,132
Wholly dependent.

1446
01:37:20,434 --> 01:37:21,093
Lydia!

1447
01:37:21,202 --> 01:37:25,138
Go, go, go, go! Hurry! Hurry!

1448
01:37:25,239 --> 01:37:26,069
Hurry, Beth!

1449
01:37:26,173 --> 01:37:27,401
Go to the garage!

1450
01:37:27,508 --> 01:37:30,102
There's a gun! Go to the garage!

1451
01:37:40,821 --> 01:37:43,346
Beth, wait! I'm so sorry.

1452
01:37:43,924 --> 01:37:45,323
I'm so sorry.

1453
01:38:37,645 --> 01:38:39,010
Beth!

1454
01:38:42,783 --> 01:38:44,182
Beth!

1455
01:38:55,229 --> 01:38:57,959
Mama always said never trust
a pretty girl.

1456
01:39:31,799 --> 01:39:33,391
Go! Go!

1457
01:39:35,636 --> 01:39:37,900
I'm going to gut you, Beth!

1458
01:39:40,307 --> 01:39:42,775
I'm going to gut you...

1459
01:40:11,505 --> 01:40:13,234
Go through the garage!

1460
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:20,908
Not my Ike.

1461
01:40:22,016 --> 01:40:23,574
No, not my baby.

1462
01:40:37,664 --> 01:40:41,156
Go to the neighbours! Get help!

1463
01:40:41,268 --> 01:40:42,929
What are you going to do?

1464
01:40:45,773 --> 01:40:47,673
You took my firstborn!

1465
01:40:47,908 --> 01:40:49,569
You ripped him from me!

1466
01:40:49,676 --> 01:40:51,143
Where are Jake's things?

1467
01:40:51,245 --> 01:40:52,974
What does it matter?

1468
01:40:53,180 --> 01:40:55,614
You killed him with your neglect!

1469
01:40:56,750 --> 01:40:57,876
It was an accident!

1470
01:41:00,454 --> 01:41:02,752
You think you deserve a second chance.

1471
01:41:02,856 --> 01:41:05,086
You have no right!

1472
01:41:08,062 --> 01:41:11,623
Everything I did,
I did to protect my baby!

1473
01:41:11,732 --> 01:41:14,200
Just like I did!

1474
01:41:25,112 --> 01:41:28,343
You tortured your children
with your demented lessons!

1475
01:41:28,449 --> 01:41:29,916
Like I was taught.

1476
01:41:30,317 --> 01:41:31,477
You taught them to be killers.

1477
01:41:31,585 --> 01:41:34,076
I taught them to survive.

1478
01:41:43,063 --> 01:41:45,623
I taught them to be strong.

1479
01:41:45,966 --> 01:41:47,661
Not weak like you.

1480
01:41:48,102 --> 01:41:51,128
Too weak to protect your own child.

1481
01:41:51,238 --> 01:41:53,536
Too weak to keep your husband.

1482
01:41:53,640 --> 01:41:56,837
Too weak to leave when you
had the chance.

1483
01:42:25,706 --> 01:42:26,934
My Addley.

1484
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:29,338
You took my Ike.

1485
01:42:39,820 --> 01:42:41,947
If my family can't live in this house...

1486
01:42:42,422 --> 01:42:44,447
you sure as hell can't either.

1487
01:43:42,416 --> 01:43:44,509
I'm stronger than you think.

1488
01:44:10,978 --> 01:44:12,309
There's somebody in here!

1489
01:44:12,412 --> 01:44:13,640
Somebody's in here.

1490
01:44:13,914 --> 01:44:17,179
We've got a live one!
Get the stretcher out.

1491
01:44:21,922 --> 01:44:24,083
Stop right here. Get the MT over here.

1492
01:44:28,795 --> 01:44:30,228
Gina!

1493
01:44:30,697 --> 01:44:32,221
My God, Gina!

1494
01:44:33,267 --> 01:44:34,996
That was it. Primary search complete.

1495
01:44:35,102 --> 01:44:38,799
No, no, no. There's somebody else
in there.

1496
01:45:29,623 --> 01:45:30,885
Come on, hon. You can do this.

1497
01:45:30,991 --> 01:45:32,322
Okay.

1498
01:45:36,363 --> 01:45:37,853
Thank you.

1499
01:46:36,123 --> 01:46:38,057
No...!

1500
01:47:04,451 --> 01:47:09,912
Hush little baby, don't you cry.

1501
01:47:10,424 --> 01:47:16,056
Mama's going to sing you a lullaby.
