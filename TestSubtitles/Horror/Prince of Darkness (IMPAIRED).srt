00:01:54,601 --> 00:01:57,079
I found Father Carlton
this morning.

2
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:01,359
He was taken to the hospital,
but he never regained consciousness.

3
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,199
Why was he here?

4
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,437
He had an appointment
with His Eminence this afternoon.

00:04:09,644 --> 00:04:12,163
Let's talk about our beliefs

8
00:04:12,164 --> 00:04:14,363
and what we can learn
about them.

9
00:04:14,364 --> 00:04:16,442
We believe...

10
00:04:16,443 --> 00:04:19,601
nature is solid
and time a constant.

11
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:23,120
Matter has substance
and time a direction.

12
00:04:23,962 --> 00:04:28,678
There is truth in flesh, huh,
and the solid ground?

13
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,157
The wind may be invisible,
but it's real.

14
00:04:32,158 --> 00:04:37,316
Smoke, fire, water, light--
they're different.

15
00:04:37,317 --> 00:04:41,876
Not as to stone or steel,
but they're tangible.

16
00:04:41,877 --> 00:04:46,553
And we assume time has an arrow
because it is as a clock.

17
00:04:46,554 --> 00:04:49,313
One second is one second
for everyone.

18
00:04:49,314 --> 00:04:52,113
Cause precedes effect.

19
00:04:52,114 --> 00:04:55,792
Fruit rots,
water flows downstream,

20
00:04:55,793 --> 00:04:58,551
we're born, we age, we die.

21
00:04:58,552 --> 00:05:00,629
The reverse never happens.

22
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,269
None of this is truth!

23
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,749
Say good-bye
to classical reality.

24
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,548
Because our logic collapses
on the subatomic level

25
00:05:08,549 --> 00:05:11,308
into ghosts and shadows.

on the universe.

34

But we've discovered something
very surprising.

35
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:16,057
While order does exist
in the universe,

36
00:08:16,058 --> 00:08:19,617
it is not at all
what we had in mind.

[female] Professor Birack,

geometry breaks down

I don't know.

43
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:51,728
Birack did that whole series of debates
on the BBC a few years ago.

44
00:08:51,728 --> 00:08:53,647
Oh, with the English priest, right.

But he left a diary.

The discovery of this supernova

00:10:16,506 --> 00:10:19,543
has immense significance
to the scientific community.

Light from the explosion
was hurled through space

at 186,000 miles per second,

He was the Guardian Priest.

Apparently, he lived here
for over 30 years.

62
00:11:23,167 --> 00:11:25,407
Once a week
he would venture out for food.

And every day...

64
00:11:29,725 --> 00:11:31,485

00:12:01,037 --> 00:12:03,516
Only the members
of this forgotten sect--

00:12:03,717 --> 00:12:06,236
The Brotherhood of Sleep.

71
00:12:06,237 --> 00:12:08,274
There was a vow of silence.

72
00:12:09,315 --> 00:12:13,714
Even their very existence
was kept from the Holy See.

73
00:12:13,715 --> 00:12:15,592
The Vatican didn't know?

74
00:12:16,154 --> 00:12:18,032
The Guardian Priest
would keep the secret.

75
00:12:19,073 --> 00:12:22,111
And before he died
would pass it on to another.

76
00:12:22,112 --> 00:12:25,270
The sect had enormous
power and authority.

no longer be kept.

A change in the Earth...

and the sky.

- I don't get it.
- What don't you get?

00:14:24,678 --> 00:14:26,237
The whole thing,
it doesn't make sense.

101
00:14:26,238 --> 00:14:28,277
It violates common sense,
that's the whole point.

102

That's what Einstein
couldn't accept.

I can't accept it either.

- There's Schrodinger's cat.
- l know, l know.

107
00:14:36,515 --> 00:14:37,515
So what's the point?

108
00:14:37,516 --> 00:14:39,874
The point is until the cat
is observed by someone

109
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,632
he's not in any definite state,
either alive or dead.

110
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:45,672
He's in a wave superposition state,
both dead and alive at the same time.

111
00:14:45,673 --> 00:14:46,671
Huh?

112
00:14:46,672 --> 00:14:49,951
Okay, only when we open the box
and observe the cat

113
00:14:49,952 --> 00:14:53,070
does he materialize into reality,
either dead or alive.

114
00:14:53,071 --> 00:14:54,270
But it doesn't make sense.

115
00:14:54,271 --> 00:14:56,229
That is the entire
complete point.

116
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,349
lt doesn't make
any common sense.

117
00:14:58,349 --> 00:15:00,907
Our common sense breaks down
on a subatomic level.

118

Why do I want a PhD in this?

are coming with us.

Sleep with him, get an A.

136
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:38,018
So, what about your plans?

137
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:40,737

I know.

143
00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:53,054
So, where did
you transfer from?

144
00:15:53,055 --> 00:15:55,533
Kneale-- theoretical physics.

145
00:15:55,534 --> 00:15:56,773
I came here to study with Birack.

146
00:15:56,774 --> 00:15:58,173
You're applied physics, right?

147
00:15:58,893 --> 00:16:01,052
Well, so, why are you taking
Birack for theory?

148
00:16:01,053 --> 00:16:03,131
I want to know
what the math means.

149
00:16:03,132 --> 00:16:06,130
Birack's ruthless.
He wants philosophers, not scientists.

150
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:07,930
Well, I've read his books,
he's a brilliant man.

151
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,569
Just when I think l've got it,
visualized it,

152
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:14,048
it just all goes away.

153
00:16:14,049 --> 00:16:17,408
I start seeing old-fashioned
classical reality again.

154
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:18,927
I want the clockwork back.

155
00:16:18,928 --> 00:16:20,525
I want to put it all
into a little box,

156
00:16:20,526 --> 00:16:23,646
but whenever l try,
it just, um, slithers out.

157
00:16:23,647 --> 00:16:24,925
Mm.

158
00:16:24,926 --> 00:16:27,724
Some things aren't changed
by quantum physics, though.

159
00:16:27,725 --> 00:16:28,964
Such as?

160
00:16:28,965 --> 00:16:31,403
Well, for instance...

161
00:16:31,404 --> 00:16:34,043
every theoretical physicist l know

162
00:16:34,044 --> 00:16:37,281
wonders why it is that no one
who looks like you

163
00:16:38,082 --> 00:16:42,001
ever seems to settle down
in our end of the building.

164
00:16:43,481 --> 00:16:46,480
That's not true and that's
an extremely sexist thing to say.

165
00:16:46,481 --> 00:16:48,319
Confirmed sexist
and proud of it.

166
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,358
Hey... I was just joking.

167
00:16:57,077 --> 00:16:58,156
What happened?

168
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,634
You talk numbers,
you get romantic.

169
00:17:02,635 --> 00:17:04,516
You talk people,
you clam up.

170
00:17:07,754 --> 00:17:09,514
Just a little miscue,
that's all.

171
00:17:10,433 --> 00:17:11,713
It's not your fault.

172
00:17:13,872 --> 00:17:15,271
I'm sorry.

173
00:17:15,272 --> 00:17:17,871
- l'll see you later.
- Wait.

174
00:17:21,352 --> 00:17:23,710
[sighs] This conversation isn't
what l had in mind.

175
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,670
Can we start over?

176
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:29,869
- Okay.
- Okay.

177
00:17:30,988 --> 00:17:33,386
I was hoping that you would need
some heIp with your theory

178
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:36,866
and that maybe
we could discuss it over...

179
00:17:36,867 --> 00:17:38,386
over dinner or something?

180
00:17:39,986 --> 00:17:42,104
Well, I suppose something
could be arranged.

181
00:17:43,186 --> 00:17:46,624
There are other things that
I need help with...

182
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:47,823
over dinner.

183
00:17:49,184 --> 00:17:52,382
I have volunteered our services
to the archdiocese.

184
00:17:52,783 --> 00:17:55,141
Each of you is
a competent physicist,

185
00:17:55,142 --> 00:17:57,900
even though you don't have
a degree to prove it.

186
00:17:57,901 --> 00:18:00,459
And participating
in this examination

187
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:03,859
will greatly improve
your classroom averages, I might add.

188
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,097
You'll plan to take
your meals there.

189
00:18:07,098 --> 00:18:08,818
We'll bring cots to sleep on.

190
00:18:09,578 --> 00:18:12,015
There are other departments
joining us.

191
00:18:12,016 --> 00:18:14,095
Excusae me, sir,
isa there some reason

192
00:18:14,096 --> 00:18:16,255
why you're not telling us
what we're gonna be doing?

193
00:18:18,016 --> 00:18:19,375
In time.

194
00:18:55,325 --> 00:18:58,004
[male] It's your disbelief
that powers him.

195
00:18:58,005 --> 00:19:03,002
Your stubborn faith in--
in common sense

196
00:19:03,003 --> 00:19:04,882
that allows his deception.

197
00:19:06,523 --> 00:19:10,122
He lives
in the smallest parts of it.

198
00:19:11,322 --> 00:19:13,279
In the atoms.

199
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,439
Smaller.

200
00:19:15,999 --> 00:19:17,320
Invisible.

201
00:19:20,999 --> 00:19:23,117
He lives in all of it.

202
00:19:24,677 --> 00:19:26,796
In the sum of its parts.

203
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:31,715
We must translate this book.

204
00:19:32,675 --> 00:19:34,754
You must prove it scientifically.

205
00:19:36,114 --> 00:19:38,113
Convince the outside world.

206
00:19:38,114 --> 00:19:42,072
The outside world doesn't want
to hear this kind of bullshit.

207
00:19:42,073 --> 00:19:43,952
Just keep it locked away.

208
00:19:43,953 --> 00:19:46,711
You've already managed that
for 2,000 years.

209
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,949
No prison can hold him now.

It's getting cold out here.

213
00:20:06,867 --> 00:20:08,865
I thought this was supposed
to be California.

214
00:20:10,065 --> 00:20:11,665
Did you have
a class tonight or--

215
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,783
- Library.
- Oh.

216
00:20:13,784 --> 00:20:16,303
Actually, I was hoping you'd have
a cup of coffee with me again.

217
00:20:18,503 --> 00:20:20,062
This is startin'
to become a habit.

218
00:20:21,062 --> 00:20:23,661

00:21:17,247 --> 00:21:18,326
Good morning.

221
00:21:19,527 --> 00:21:20,886
Thank you.

222
00:21:26,004 --> 00:21:28,124
- We didn't get much sleep.
- Mmm.

223
00:21:29,285 --> 00:21:30,603
Who needs sleep?

224
00:21:32,482 --> 00:21:34,442
We do, today's Friday.

225
00:21:35,442 --> 00:21:36,681
Can I telI you something?

226
00:21:37,722 --> 00:21:39,680
- Oh, please don't.
- I want to.

227
00:21:40,921 --> 00:21:43,559
[sighs]
Tell me next time.

228
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,518
If there is one.

229
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:47,119
Or the time after that.

230
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,038
Or... two years from now.

231
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:54,596
Who was he,

232
00:21:54,597 --> 00:21:57,235
the one who gave you
such a high opinion of men?

233
00:21:59,595 --> 00:22:02,675
I wouldn't like it if either of us
jumped to conclusions.

234
00:22:03,514 --> 00:22:06,394
How do you know I was gonna say
what you think l was gonna say?

235
00:22:07,754 --> 00:22:09,313
Because if you don't...

Oh, please don't tell me.

This place gives me
the creeps.

242
00:23:43,768 --> 00:23:45,007
It was abandoned.

243
00:23:45,008 --> 00:23:46,647
Hm, I never would have guessed.

244
00:23:46,648 --> 00:23:48,365
No, l hear it used
to be a beautiful church.

- When?
- In the 1950s.

246
00:23:50,406 --> 00:23:52,204
My husband's parents
used to come here.

And then for some reason
it was cIosed down.

I'm glad you couId come, yes.

257
00:24:29,276 --> 00:24:31,315
Well, now, all I really know
about what's going on here

258
00:24:31,476 --> 00:24:33,554
is what one of your students
told me on the telephone.

00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:34,552
Oh, yeah, we're just
getting organized.

- find a spot over there.
- All right.

00:41:27,721 --> 00:41:33,158
it can move other objects
instantaneously across a distance

484
00:41:33,159 --> 00:41:34,877
without outside intervention.

485
00:41:34,878 --> 00:41:36,438
Psychokinesis.

486
00:41:38,038 --> 00:41:39,795
Mind-directed energy.

487
00:41:41,677 --> 00:41:43,235
Don't tell the others yet.

488
00:41:43,236 --> 00:41:44,715
Why not?

489
00:41:44,716 --> 00:41:48,914
They have a right to know that this--
that it-- it's conscious.

490
00:41:48,915 --> 00:41:51,073
Not until you prove
that it wasn't something else--

491
00:41:51,074 --> 00:41:53,273
a power surge or a draft of air.

492
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:57,392
All right.

493
00:42:02,112 --> 00:42:03,110
[crunching]

494
00:42:17,827 --> 00:42:19,665
You missed
the big history lesson.

495
00:42:24,186 --> 00:42:26,504
You're not gonna believe
what's been going on up here.

496
00:42:37,062 --> 00:42:37,941
[clunk]

497
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:48,778
Want one?

498
00:42:51,178 --> 00:42:53,136
Anyone ever tell you
that you could pass for Asian?

499
00:42:56,537 --> 00:42:57,575
Whew.

500
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:01,734
What was that all about?

501
00:43:01,735 --> 00:43:03,134
No sense of humor.

502
00:43:03,134 --> 00:43:04,934
- Have you seen Susan?
- Who?

503
00:43:04,935 --> 00:43:07,653
- Radiologist, glasses--
- Oh yeah, she's right outside.

504
00:43:13,372 --> 00:43:14,411
Where?

505
00:43:23,409 --> 00:43:24,608
She was there.

506
00:43:25,289 --> 00:43:26,848
I think somebody
ought to tell her.

507
00:43:26,849 --> 00:43:29,927
Look, am I crazy or are we stroking
ourselves heavily here?

508
00:43:32,567 --> 00:43:35,005
Thank you for taking the time
to share yourthoughts.

509
00:43:55,481 --> 00:43:56,600
Susan?

510
00:44:06,758 --> 00:44:07,916
There's more to it.

511
00:44:20,474 --> 00:44:22,993
Some kind of power,

512
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:24,832
directed outward.

513
00:44:24,833 --> 00:44:26,550
A controlled force.

514
00:44:27,072 --> 00:44:28,910
What's it doing?

515
00:44:28,911 --> 00:44:30,150
Reaching out.

516
00:44:31,111 --> 00:44:32,549
Influencing.

517
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:35,269
Changing things.

518
00:44:38,029 --> 00:44:40,308
Moving objects by thought.

519
00:44:44,028 --> 00:44:45,785
Extraordinary intervention.

520
00:44:45,786 --> 00:44:48,105
An intelligent cause
other than man.

521
00:44:55,344 --> 00:44:56,702
Susan?

522
00:44:58,864 --> 00:45:00,142
Hello?

523
00:45:25,256 --> 00:45:27,255
[beeping]

524
00:45:34,974 --> 00:45:37,292
[beeps accelerating]

[crunch]

526
00:45:56,368 --> 00:46:00,006
Suppose...
what your faith has said

527
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,926
was essentially correct.

528
00:46:03,166 --> 00:46:07,563
Suppose there is a universal mind
controlling everything.

529
00:46:07,564 --> 00:46:11,843
A god willing the behavior
of every subatomic particle.

530
00:46:13,204 --> 00:46:17,082
Now, every particle has
an antiparticle.

531
00:46:17,843 --> 00:46:19,321
Its mirror image.

532
00:46:20,561 --> 00:46:22,520
Its negative side.

533
00:46:23,401 --> 00:46:26,719
Maybe this universal mind

534
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:31,198
resides in the mirror image,
instead of in our universe,

535
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:33,197
as we wanted to believe.

536
00:46:35,357 --> 00:46:37,875
Maybe he's anti-God,

537
00:46:37,876 --> 00:46:40,315
bringing darkness
instead of light.

538
00:46:40,956 --> 00:46:43,394
Why weren't we told the truth?

539
00:46:43,395 --> 00:46:46,474
[chuckles]
Without the technology to confirm,

540
00:46:47,434 --> 00:46:49,273
it would have been another legend.

541
00:46:49,274 --> 00:46:51,912
But he was our prisoner,
not yours!

542
00:46:53,392 --> 00:46:55,070
We had a resaponsibility

543
00:46:55,912 --> 00:46:57,991
to warn the rest ofthe world!

544
00:46:59,232 --> 00:47:02,268
Only the corrupt
are listened to now.

545
00:47:02,269 --> 00:47:05,988
And they tell us
what we want to hear.

546
00:47:07,469 --> 00:47:11,107
We believe it to be divine light.
[chuckles]

547
00:47:13,707 --> 00:47:15,425
Itjust got colder in here.

548
00:47:16,146 --> 00:47:18,025
[whispers]
I know.

549
00:47:18,026 --> 00:47:20,304
Suddenly, as if--

550
00:47:20,305 --> 00:47:22,944
as if something mov--

551
00:47:22,945 --> 00:47:24,783
moved through the room.

552
00:47:25,704 --> 00:47:27,703
[no audible dialog]

553
00:47:34,302 --> 00:47:36,181
Listen, do you realize
what's going on up there?

554
00:47:36,182 --> 00:47:38,379
We are on the brink
ofthe ultimate truth!

555
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:40,579
Oh, this priest is a real case.

556
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:42,138
He is Looney Tunes.

557
00:47:42,139 --> 00:47:44,377
And l'm beginning to wonder
about Birack too.

558
00:47:44,378 --> 00:47:45,578
I'm going back.

559
00:47:46,178 --> 00:47:48,337
- Come on, Calder.
- Come on, Frank!

560
00:47:49,897 --> 00:47:51,656
You're out ofyour minds!

00:47:51,657 --> 00:47:53,015
This is ajoke!

00:47:53,776 --> 00:47:55,294
This is caca!

Uh, he left.

579
00:50:11,618 --> 00:50:12,738
When?

580
00:50:13,739 --> 00:50:15,417
[Calder]
Oh, about 20 minutes ago.

581
00:50:16,338 --> 00:50:18,456
We tried to talk him
out of it, but, uh...

582
00:50:18,457 --> 00:50:20,056
Has anyone seen Susan?

00:50:20,057 --> 00:50:22,375
- Who?
- The radiologist.

Well, maybe sahe left too.

the right idea.

in the lab in half an hour.

- Mullins left?
- I don't know.

does not include my unconscious.

The Guardian Priests had
the dream for years.

What does it mean?

632
00:54:40,666 --> 00:54:41,785
A premonition.

633
00:54:42,826 --> 00:54:45,464
The dream evolves, unfolds.

634
00:54:45,465 --> 00:54:48,424
We shall start to have it
every time we go to sleep.

00:54:50,103 --> 00:54:53,382
As if it's pushing
everything else out.

Making room for itself.

Mullins?

638
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:06,738
Do you think he really
just took off?

639

I mean, like he was actually believing
this whoIe business?

00:55:10,859 --> 00:55:12,737
Why is everybody looking
at me that way?

'Cause you're being assholish.

Well, it's very assholish
ofyou to say so.

643

Look, Mullins is probably
off asleep someplace.

644
00:55:18,977 --> 00:55:21,056
Or he's boffing the radiologist.

I hope he's getting laid.

to a nice Chinese restaurant.

No wonder I'm so tired.

649
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:56,765
I keep getting these figures
in the computer,

650
00:55:56,766 --> 00:55:58,244
but they're not
making any sense.

651
00:55:58,245 --> 00:56:00,843
I stopped making sense
about 15 minutes ago.

652
00:56:00,844 --> 00:56:03,563
No, l mean these equations
are beyond me now.

653
00:56:03,564 --> 00:56:04,963
They're like another language.

654
00:56:04,964 --> 00:56:06,283
Mmm.

655
00:56:07,483 --> 00:56:09,921
Uh, go get some sleep,
I'll wake you in a half an hour.

656
00:56:09,922 --> 00:56:11,841
- Oh, 45 minutes?
- Okay.

657
00:56:11,842 --> 00:56:13,240
[whispers]
Ahh.

658
00:56:13,721 --> 00:56:15,480
Hey, are you okay?

659
00:56:16,121 --> 00:56:17,920
[sighs]
Numb.

660
00:56:19,001 --> 00:56:21,358
I know what you mean.

661
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:24,637
I just want to go home, pretend none
ofthis is really happening.

662
00:56:24,638 --> 00:56:26,517
[sighs]
Ohh.

663
00:56:26,518 --> 00:56:28,276
What's that?

664
00:56:28,277 --> 00:56:29,396
Huh?

665
00:56:29,397 --> 00:56:32,556
Oh, it'sjust a bruise
I got somehow.

666
00:56:32,557 --> 00:56:33,555
[whispers]
Oh.

667
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:35,714
Finally stopped hurting.

668
00:56:36,875 --> 00:56:38,474
Almost looks like
a figure of some kind.

669
00:56:38,475 --> 00:56:40,153
You know,
I gotta close my eyes.

670
00:56:40,154 --> 00:56:42,353
- Okay, l'll wake you.
- Thanks.

671
00:56:45,032 --> 00:56:57,868
[sighs]

672
00:56:59,589 --> 00:57:00,748
Hello.

673
00:57:01,948 --> 00:57:04,547
[sighs] l'm opening the door
ifyou want to stop what you're doing

674
00:57:04,548 --> 00:57:06,266
and put your clothes on.

675
00:57:15,385 --> 00:57:17,184
Big doings in the lab tonight.

676
00:57:17,185 --> 00:57:18,263
There's a meeting.

677
00:57:18,264 --> 00:57:20,422
Oh, give mejust 15 minutes.

678
00:57:20,423 --> 00:57:22,421
- You want me to come back?
- Later.

679
00:57:25,062 --> 00:57:26,421
Ohh.

680
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:33,378
- Any luck?
- Can't find anybody.

681
00:57:33,379 --> 00:57:34,498
I'm going up to the lab.

682
00:57:34,499 --> 00:57:35,698
Yeah, I'll be there in a minute.

683
00:57:39,498 --> 00:57:41,056
We're having
a meeting in the lab.

684
00:57:41,057 --> 00:57:42,176
[typing]

685
00:57:42,177 --> 00:57:43,136
Lisa.

686
00:57:44,897 --> 00:57:46,775
Mona Lisa?

687
00:57:53,255 --> 00:57:54,694
Lisa?

688
00:58:58,477 --> 00:59:01,715
This whole building is gonna have
to be encased in concrete.

689
00:59:01,716 --> 00:59:03,074
No way, a building this size?

690
00:59:03,075 --> 00:59:04,554
I say we launch the fucker
into space.

691
00:59:04,555 --> 00:59:05,674
I'm-- I'm hearing something.

692
00:59:06,235 --> 00:59:08,273
[beeping]

693
00:59:20,031 --> 00:59:21,989
[groaning]

694
00:59:21,990 --> 00:59:23,989
[gurgling]

695
00:59:29,989 --> 00:59:31,667
Where are the others?

696
00:59:31,668 --> 00:59:33,026
I think they've left.

697
00:59:33,027 --> 00:59:35,066
Kelly's asleep,
I didn't want to wake her up.

698
00:59:36,506 --> 00:59:38,825
I'm asking you to stay.

699
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:41,864
The work that we do
in the next 48 hours is critical.

700
00:59:41,865 --> 00:59:44,223
How many ofyou
have fallen asleep tonight?

701
00:59:44,224 --> 00:59:45,463
Come on, please tell me.

702
00:59:45,945 --> 00:59:47,303
Come on, please!

703
00:59:49,224 --> 00:59:50,502
You dreamed.

704
00:59:50,503 --> 00:59:53,181
You dreamed about the front
ofthis church.

705
00:59:54,222 --> 00:59:57,099
About a-- a dark figure coming out.

706
00:59:58,101 --> 00:59:59,380
Didn't you...

707
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:01,819
Didn't you feel it?

708
01:00:03,139 --> 01:00:05,218
Not like a dream.

709
01:00:05,219 --> 01:00:06,697
Like saomething elsae.

710
01:00:08,058 --> 01:00:08,978
Here.

711
01:00:11,018 --> 01:00:12,615
[Birack]
l had the dream too.

712
01:00:13,816 --> 01:00:18,054
This image of something that didn't
seem to belong to my subconscious.

713
01:00:18,055 --> 01:00:21,573
Almost as if I were watching
something prerecorded.

714
01:00:21,574 --> 01:00:22,732
Tachyons?

715
01:00:22,733 --> 01:00:24,012
[Birack]
One possaibility.

716
01:00:24,374 --> 01:00:25,413
[male]
What's that?

717
01:00:26,013 --> 01:00:28,091
It's a Greek word.

718
01:00:28,092 --> 01:00:29,851
It means, "swift one."

719
01:00:29,852 --> 01:00:32,570
So, what is the dream, huh?

720
01:00:32,571 --> 01:00:34,050
Precognition?

721
01:00:34,651 --> 01:00:37,049
Previous knowledge
of a future event?

722
01:00:38,130 --> 01:00:41,688
A shared vision of something
that is yet to occur?

723
01:00:41,689 --> 01:00:43,247
Caused by that thing downstairs?

724
01:00:43,569 --> 01:00:45,047
Perhaps not.

725
01:00:45,048 --> 01:00:48,886
Tachyon is a subatomic particle
that travels faster than light.

726
01:00:48,887 --> 01:00:50,326
[Father]
Supposaing it isan't a dream?

727
01:00:51,566 --> 01:00:54,005
Supposing it's a message?

728
01:00:54,006 --> 01:00:57,764
What ifthese dreams,
premonitions, omens--

729
01:00:57,765 --> 01:01:01,403
What if they're really
visual messaages

730
01:01:01,404 --> 01:01:03,362
sent by other
human beings?

731
01:01:03,363 --> 01:01:06,001
Photographs, video signals.

732
01:01:06,002 --> 01:01:07,201
From where?

733
01:01:07,202 --> 01:01:08,601
[female]
The future.

734
01:01:08,602 --> 01:01:11,360
Anything travelling faster
than the speed of light

735
01:01:11,361 --> 01:01:13,558
would appear to be going
backward in time.

736
01:01:13,559 --> 01:01:16,478
A future scientist
calculates the exact spot

737
01:01:16,479 --> 01:01:18,558
that the Earth occupied
in space in the past,

738
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:21,117
given trajectory and speed.

739
01:01:21,118 --> 01:01:25,675
He then beams
a tachyon signal at that spot,

740
01:01:25,676 --> 01:01:29,955
transmitting video information
backwards through time.

741
01:01:29,956 --> 01:01:32,874
For us to receive
as electrical impulses.

742
01:01:32,875 --> 01:01:34,194
Neural stimulus.

743
01:01:34,675 --> 01:01:36,993
- Man, oh, man.
- For what purpose?

744
01:01:36,994 --> 01:01:38,832
[Brian]
Could be a warning

745
01:01:38,833 --> 01:01:41,192
to show us
what's going to happen.

746
01:01:41,193 --> 01:01:42,311
A sort of...

747
01:01:43,512 --> 01:01:46,272
remote camera view
ofthe future.

748
01:01:47,350 --> 01:01:48,589
So that we can change it.

749
01:01:59,148 --> 01:02:01,426
Someone has finally
shown up to tell us.

750
01:02:03,547 --> 01:02:05,465
I think it's time we stood up
forwhat we are.

751
01:02:05,787 --> 01:02:07,146
[buzzing]

752
01:02:08,226 --> 01:02:09,585
I think there's something
wrong with this.

753
01:02:09,586 --> 01:02:10,665
I'm not getting anything now.

754
01:02:10,666 --> 01:02:11,664
They've gone dead.

755
01:02:16,743 --> 01:02:17,902
[male]
Maybe the generator's failed.

756
01:02:17,903 --> 01:02:20,501
[male #2] No, it looks more like
the units downstairs have been cut off.

757
01:02:27,181 --> 01:02:30,498
[creepy male voice]
Hello? Hello?

758
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:32,778
Hey, Wyndham!

759
01:02:34,979 --> 01:02:38,896
[creepy voice]
Hello? Hello?

760
01:02:41,497 --> 01:02:42,775
Come here, look at this.

761
01:02:51,333 --> 01:02:53,732
I've got a message for you

762
01:02:53,733 --> 01:02:56,531
and you're not going to like it.

763
01:02:56,532 --> 01:02:57,972
Look at his chest.

764
01:02:58,693 --> 01:03:01,131
[stirring and crackling]

765
01:03:03,131 --> 01:03:05,289
Pray for death.

Jesus Christ!

01:03:33,682 --> 01:03:39,680

about what l said before.

814
01:11:39,352 --> 01:11:40,830
You don't look Asian at all.

815
01:11:45,150 --> 01:11:46,829
[whispers]
Shit.

816
01:11:48,109 --> 01:11:49,428
I thought I heard Walter.

817
01:11:57,546 --> 01:11:58,505
Walter?

818
01:11:59,466 --> 01:12:00,865
Walter!

819
01:12:04,785 --> 01:12:06,223
What the fuck do you want?

820
01:12:06,224 --> 01:12:07,742
Where are you?

821
01:12:07,743 --> 01:12:09,303
lf I told you,
you wouldn't believe me.

[knocks]

823
01:12:16,302 --> 01:12:19,100
Hey, can you dig through
and get me outta here?

824
01:12:22,379 --> 01:12:23,899
I don't know,
the wall's pretty thick.

825
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:25,418
Are you all right?

826
01:12:25,419 --> 01:12:27,497
Well, that's a relative thing
right now, but yeah.

827
01:12:28,778 --> 01:12:30,017
Wait a second.

828
01:12:39,576 --> 01:12:42,853
They're just standing there outside,
not trying to get in.

829
01:12:42,853 --> 01:12:44,653
They've stopped attacking,
for some reason.

830
01:12:44,654 --> 01:12:46,572
Hey, Walter,
where are you exactly?

831
01:12:46,974 --> 01:12:48,292
I'm in this closet.

832
01:12:49,812 --> 01:12:51,411
Hey, I think we can get
through with this.

833
01:12:52,251 --> 01:12:53,451
It's gonna take a while.

834
01:12:54,091 --> 01:12:56,610
Walter, we're gonna try
and dig through!

835
01:12:56,611 --> 01:12:58,370
How long will it take?

836
01:12:58,370 --> 01:12:59,968
[male]
A couple hours.

837
01:12:59,969 --> 01:13:02,529
Oh, great, I'll tell you what,
l'll hang out here anyway.

Well, get ready
to pull me back.

01:14:16,949 --> 01:14:17,868
Ooh!

845
01:14:25,947 --> 01:14:27,305
[Lomax]
Get up here.

846
01:14:27,306 --> 01:14:29,385
Come on, Brian,
Come on, Brian, Come on!

847
01:14:29,386 --> 01:14:30,905
- Come on, let's go!
- Get up!

848
01:14:31,664 --> 01:14:34,063
[Lomax] Come on, hurry up!
Come on, come on!

849
01:14:34,904 --> 01:14:37,023
- Hurry.
- Come on, Brian, come on!

850
01:14:49,420 --> 01:14:51,299
You guys seen

All right.

854
01:15:14,733 --> 01:15:17,411
A Jewish mother goes to the airport
to meet her daughter.

855
01:15:17,412 --> 01:15:21,570
The daughter steps offthe plane
with an eight-foot-tall zulu warrior

856
01:15:21,571 --> 01:15:22,970
with a bone through his nose.

857
01:15:23,291 --> 01:15:28,209
The mother screams,
"You fool, l said a rich doctor!"

01:15:28,210 --> 01:15:30,568

[male]
Not a dream.

860
01:15:41,765 --> 01:15:46,004
We are using your brain's
electrical system as a receiver.

861
01:15:46,005 --> 01:15:50,523
We are unable to transmit
through conscious neural interference.

862
01:15:50,524 --> 01:15:53,202
You are receiving
this broadcast asa a dream.

863
01:15:53,923 --> 01:15:57,521

[digging and scraping]

01:16:19,716 --> 01:16:22,433
We can try the hallway
after it gets dark.

866
01:16:22,434 --> 01:16:24,594
If I can make my way up front,
I could break some windows,

867
01:16:24,595 --> 01:16:25,753
call for help.

868
01:16:27,793 --> 01:16:29,952
No one out there
can help us.

869
01:16:50,628 --> 01:16:53,946
The other morning you said
that you had something to tell me.

870
01:16:56,466 --> 01:16:59,024
[sighs]
Well, you probably...

871
01:17:00,224 --> 01:17:02,143
think that none ofthat
matters now.

872
01:17:03,664 --> 01:17:06,062
[sighs]
But you're wrong.

873
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:08,581
It's the only thing that does.

01:18:16,724 --> 01:18:21,202
Street people, our colleagues--
all controlled.

879
01:18:23,962 --> 01:18:26,321
- Demonic possession?
- Of a kind.

880
01:18:27,882 --> 01:18:31,119
Not what we would expect, though.
Never that.

881
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:33,999
Why would he need us?

882
01:18:34,639 --> 01:18:37,198
The book says,
"His purpose is to bring

883
01:18:37,199 --> 01:18:40,036
the father back
from the dark side."

884
01:18:40,037 --> 01:18:41,316
Whereverthat is.

885
01:18:41,477 --> 01:18:44,317
There could be a limit
as to what he can do, you know,

886
01:18:44,318 --> 01:18:46,274
as a volume of liquid.

887
01:18:46,956 --> 01:18:50,635
He controls
simple organisms easily.

888
01:18:51,635 --> 01:18:55,912
But maybe he needs something more
complex to complete a life cycle.

889
01:18:56,354 --> 01:18:58,152
A hosat in which to live.

[Walter]
Hello?

891
01:19:01,112 --> 01:19:02,511
Hello.

01:19:02,512 --> 01:19:03,911
Walter?

893
01:19:03,912 --> 01:19:06,350
It's Kelly, she's changing again.

894
01:19:06,750 --> 01:19:08,029
The swelling's gone down,

895
01:19:08,030 --> 01:19:10,708
as ifthe liquid was absorbed
into her saystem.

896
01:19:10,709 --> 01:19:12,588
l can see tissue
changesa on herface.

897
01:19:13,308 --> 01:19:15,548
Also, I think her bone structure
is changing.

898
01:19:15,908 --> 01:19:20,026
Maybe this is the only way
he could actualize his power.

899
01:19:20,986 --> 01:19:24,544
A parasite growing into its host.

900
01:19:24,545 --> 01:19:27,224
This could be some kind
of gestation period.

901
01:19:27,225 --> 01:19:29,623
[sighs]
I know I'd seen it before.

902
01:19:29,624 --> 01:19:30,903
Kelly had a mark.

903
01:19:30,904 --> 01:19:33,063
It was a bruise,
almost like a figure.

904
01:19:33,063 --> 01:19:34,822
I saw it in a history book.

905
01:19:34,823 --> 01:19:38,581
The astrologer's staff used
in ritual magic in the Middle Ages?

906
01:19:38,582 --> 01:19:40,381
-The mark was on her?
- Yes.

907
01:19:41,261 --> 01:19:42,779
As if she were chosen.

908
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:45,539
Walter!

909
01:19:45,540 --> 01:19:48,978
- What?
- Keep watching her closely.

01:32:00,342 --> 01:32:02,460
The future conjured up by that...

981
01:32:04,821 --> 01:32:07,019
that vile serpent...

982
01:32:08,700 --> 01:32:10,338
will not happen now.

983
01:32:15,938 --> 01:32:17,655
[sighs]

984
01:32:24,295 --> 01:32:27,253
[Birack] The samaller parts
could not live

985
01:32:27,254 --> 01:32:29,452
without the strength
ofthe whole.

986
01:32:29,453 --> 01:32:31,413
They had to die.

987
01:32:31,414 --> 01:32:35,611
To fade away as the whole was
thrown back and repelled.

988
01:32:38,331 --> 01:32:40,569
We're safe,

989
01:32:40,570 --> 01:32:42,609
but he's waiting
on the other side.

990
01:32:46,410 --> 01:32:48,087
She died for us.

991
01:32:52,767 --> 01:32:54,527
[man]
This is not a dream.

992
01:32:54,528 --> 01:32:55,886
Not a dream.

993
01:32:56,526 --> 01:32:59,845
We are using your brain's
electrical system as a receiver.

994
01:33:00,725 --> 01:33:04,484
We are unable to transmit
through conscious neural interference.

995
01:33:05,244 --> 01:33:08,642
You are receiving
this broadcast asa a dream.

996
01:33:08,643 --> 01:33:12,921
We are transmitting
from the year 1-9-9-9.

997
01:33:13,683 --> 01:33:15,480
You are receiving this broadcasat

998
01:33:15,481 --> 01:33:17,920
in order to alter the events
you are seeing.

999
01:33:18,761 --> 01:33:21,479
Our technology has now
developed a transmitter

1000
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:23,878
satrong enough to reach
your consacious state of awareness.

1001
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:26,278
But this isa not a dream.

1002
01:33:27,238 --> 01:33:29,917
You are saeeing what is an actual
occurring phenomenon

1003
01:33:29,917 --> 01:33:32,396
for purpose of causaality violation.

1004
01:33:38,116 --> 01:33:39,434
[yells]

1005
01:33:39,435 --> 01:33:40,793
Oh!
