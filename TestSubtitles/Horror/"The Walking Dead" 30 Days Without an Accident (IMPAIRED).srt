Yeah.

68
00:05:20,715 --> 00:05:24,051
The thing is, we had a pretty

we're drawing more of them out.

- You need an apron.
- Yeah.

them on the fence.

I hate it.

101
00:07:34,882 --> 00:07:37,050
I mean, when they're
coming at you out there,

102

it's different.

103

You don't even think about it.

104
00:07:40,521 --> 00:07:43,223
When they're stacked up
against the chain-link,

105

different to help out.

108

You always volunteered to do it.

109
00:07:57,939 --> 00:08:00,090
That's because you
were always doing it.

- Hi.
- What's up?

117
00:08:36,661 --> 00:08:39,963
Well, the council pulled back
everyone on the coal crew

118
00:08:39,964 --> 00:08:41,915
from going on the run.

119

They're shorthanded right now.

120
00:08:43,718 --> 00:08:45,836
I figured I'd step up
to help, go with 'em.

00:08:54,562 --> 00:08:56,930
it's dangerous going out there.

I know.

126
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:03,904

gonna say good-bye?

00:09:03,905 --> 00:09:05,489
Nope.

00:11:31,886 --> 00:11:34,621
Glad to see you in one piece.

167
00:11:34,622 --> 00:11:36,590
I'm thinking of looking
over near Macon.

168
00:11:38,342 --> 00:11:40,093
It's worth a shot.

169
00:11:40,094 --> 00:11:42,162
Daryl:
70 miles of walkers.

170
00:11:42,163 --> 00:11:44,964
You might run into
a few unneighborly types.

171
00:11:44,965 --> 00:11:46,650
Is it?

172
00:11:50,304 --> 00:11:51,972
I'm gonna go check out
the Big Spot.

173
00:11:51,973 --> 00:11:54,708
The one I was talking
about, just seeing.

174
00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:57,377
Rick: Yeah, I got to go
out and check the snares.

175
00:11:57,378 --> 00:11:59,946
I don't want to lose whatever
we catch to the walkers.

176
00:11:59,947 --> 00:12:01,314
I'll go.

177
00:12:01,315 --> 00:12:03,016
You just got here.

178
00:12:03,017 --> 00:12:05,685
And I'll be back.

179
00:12:07,888 --> 00:12:10,340
( revs motor )

180
00:12:10,341 --> 00:12:12,626
( engine starts )

181
00:12:16,213 --> 00:12:18,298
( growling )

182
00:12:22,053 --> 00:12:24,220
- Going to check the snares?
- I am.

183
00:12:24,221 --> 00:12:26,906
You're not.
Do your chores.

184
00:12:26,907 --> 00:12:29,342
Read comics.
Maybe some books, too.

185
00:12:29,343 --> 00:12:31,778
Hang out with Patrick.

186
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:33,813
Maybe go to story time.

187
00:12:33,814 --> 00:12:35,949
Dad, that's for kids.

188
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,684
Yeah.

189
00:12:39,253 --> 00:12:41,187
Now brush her down.

190
00:12:48,963 --> 00:12:52,432
Nothing wrong with
staying close, Rick.

191
00:12:52,433 --> 00:12:54,901
Everyone understands.

192
00:12:54,902 --> 00:12:56,603
You're growing us enough food

193
00:12:56,604 --> 00:12:58,872
so we won't need
to do runs soon.

194
00:12:58,873 --> 00:13:02,175
But we do have to find you
a good pair of overalls.

195
00:13:02,176 --> 00:13:04,561
You need to look the part.

196
00:13:04,562 --> 00:13:06,896
A little piece of wheat out
of the corner of your mouth.

197
00:13:06,897 --> 00:13:08,381
Maybe a bigger ass.

198
00:13:08,382 --> 00:13:11,234
( laughs )
Yeah.

199
00:13:11,235 --> 00:13:14,888
Listen, the rest
of the council--

200
00:13:14,889 --> 00:13:17,724
Daryl, Glenn, Carol, Sasha,

201
00:13:17,725 --> 00:13:20,994
all of them--

202
00:13:20,995 --> 00:13:23,296
they wanted me to talk to you.

203
00:13:23,297 --> 00:13:26,066
When you go out there,

204
00:13:26,067 --> 00:13:28,268
you got to take your gun.

205
00:13:28,269 --> 00:13:31,004
- ( horse snorts )
- Easy now.

206
00:13:31,005 --> 00:13:33,373
It's just outside the fence.

207
00:13:33,374 --> 00:13:35,508
I have my knife.

208
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:38,211
I get in trouble, six bullets
isn't gonna make the difference.

209
00:13:38,212 --> 00:13:41,915
Rick, we want you to be safe.

210
00:13:43,217 --> 00:13:45,585
Bring your gun.

211
00:13:52,426 --> 00:13:54,928
( flies buzzing )

212
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:10,710

Please.

216

Please?

217
00:14:47,615 --> 00:14:49,749
Please help me.

218
00:14:52,638 --> 00:14:54,906
I know you don't know me.

219
00:14:54,907 --> 00:14:57,875
Okay, I know that.

220
00:14:57,876 --> 00:15:01,579
But can you please help me
get this to my husband?

221
00:15:03,248 --> 00:15:05,950
We haven't eaten in days.

222
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,075
Here.
Go ahead.

223
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:40,485
Thank you.

224
00:15:50,095 --> 00:15:52,847
Do you have a camp around here?

225
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,301
Yeah.

226
00:15:59,271 --> 00:16:02,073
Could we possibly
come back with you?

227
00:16:03,609 --> 00:16:06,577
We've been doing...

228
00:16:06,578 --> 00:16:09,146
very badly on our own.

229
00:16:17,456 --> 00:16:19,540
I'd have to meet him.

230
00:16:21,359 --> 00:16:24,361
I need to ask him some
questions, both of you.

231
00:16:25,631 --> 00:16:28,165
What questions?

232
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,834
Just three.

233
00:16:29,835 --> 00:16:31,802
When we get there.

234
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:36,140
You have a gun on you?

235
00:16:37,342 --> 00:16:39,310
Can I make sure?

236
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:49,103
Yeah.

237
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:53,524
Look, I don't know you,

238
00:16:53,525 --> 00:16:56,560
so I'm just gonna
tell you this.

239
00:16:56,561 --> 00:16:59,947

240

anything--

you're gonna be
the one who loses.

242

I don't have
anything else to lose.

243

No.

244
00:17:16,682 --> 00:17:18,933
You do.

245
00:17:23,272 --> 00:17:24,805
Go ahead.

Child #2:
<i>This one's Wayne.</i>

249

- Nick.
- Nick, over here.

Hi, Nick!

251
00:17:42,774 --> 00:17:44,992
- Hi, Nick.
- Carl: You're naming them?

252
00:17:44,993 --> 00:17:47,378
Well, one of them
has a name tag,

253
00:17:47,379 --> 00:17:50,181
so we thought
all of them should.

254
00:17:50,182 --> 00:17:52,717
They had names when they were alive.
They're dead now.

255
00:17:52,718 --> 00:17:55,186
No, they're not.
They're just different.

256

What the hell
are you talking about?

257
00:17:56,672 --> 00:17:58,789
Okay, they don't talk.

258
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:01,759
They don't think.
They eat people.

259
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,260
They kill people.

260
00:18:03,261 --> 00:18:05,363
People kill people.
They still have names.

261
00:18:05,364 --> 00:18:07,298
Have you seen what happens?

262
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:09,500
Have you seen someone
die like that?

263
00:18:09,501 --> 00:18:13,304
Yeah, I have.

264
00:18:13,305 --> 00:18:16,507
They're not people
and they're not pets.

265
00:18:16,508 --> 00:18:18,809
Don't name them.

266
00:18:20,145 --> 00:18:22,246
We're supposed to go read.
Come on.

268
00:18:29,054 --> 00:18:32,123
Uh, yeah.

269
00:18:32,124 --> 00:18:33,341
See you then.

270
00:18:35,544 --> 00:18:39,180
I go sometimes.
I'm immature.

I'll catch you later,

Yep.

Army came in
and put these fences up.

276
00:18:51,476 --> 00:18:53,477
Made it a place
for the people to go.

277
00:18:53,478 --> 00:18:55,613
Last week when we
spotted this place,

278
00:18:55,614 --> 00:18:58,149
there was a bunch of walkers
behind this chain-link

279
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:01,485
keeping people out
like a bunch of guard dogs.

You drew 'em out.

Put a boom box out there
three days ago.

286

Hooked it up
to two car batteries.

Grab what you can.

Daryl did before the turn.

for, like, six weeks.

Yeah, I'm pacing myself.

When they shut down
the airports,

331
00:22:11,613 --> 00:22:14,514
our connecting flight
never connected.

332
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:18,752
They wouldn't let us
leave the terminal, so...

333
00:22:20,221 --> 00:22:23,523
we slept next to these huge

334
00:22:23,524 --> 00:22:26,593
marble sculptures
from Zimbabwe.

335
00:22:28,262 --> 00:22:31,298
Then, on the fourth night,

336
00:22:31,299 --> 00:22:34,801
the things just came through.

337
00:22:34,802 --> 00:22:37,054
There were a lot of us and...

338
00:22:38,539 --> 00:22:40,807
now it's just Eddie and me.

339
00:22:42,376 --> 00:22:44,511
And I wouldn't have made it

340
00:22:44,512 --> 00:22:46,596
if it wasn't for him.

341
00:22:48,182 --> 00:22:49,883
And it isn't that...

342
00:22:52,236 --> 00:22:56,823
he saved me over and over again

343
00:22:56,824 --> 00:22:59,443
or that he showed me the things

344
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:02,663
that I had to do or...

345
00:23:02,664 --> 00:23:04,698
to be willing to do.

346
00:23:06,868 --> 00:23:09,503
If he wasn't still here...

347
00:23:09,504 --> 00:23:12,706
I-- I couldn't be.

348
00:23:14,175 --> 00:23:16,910
I just-- I couldn't.

349
00:23:18,212 --> 00:23:20,130
What were they?

350
00:23:20,131 --> 00:23:21,682
What?

351
00:23:23,217 --> 00:23:26,253
The things you had
to be willing to do?

352
00:23:26,254 --> 00:23:28,088
Um...

353
00:23:28,089 --> 00:23:31,441
eating whatever
we could find--

354
00:23:31,442 --> 00:23:33,760
animal carcasses

355
00:23:33,761 --> 00:23:36,763
and rotten fruit-- and...

356
00:23:38,199 --> 00:23:40,617
<i>leaving people behind.</i>

357
00:23:43,154 --> 00:23:46,289
Hiding from people
who needed my help.

358
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:50,327
Unlike you.

359
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:57,167
This is not charity.

360
00:23:57,168 --> 00:23:59,219
You have to have numbers.

361
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:02,055
People are the best
defense against walkers

362
00:24:02,056 --> 00:24:04,174
or people.

363
00:24:04,175 --> 00:24:05,959
We help each other.

364
00:24:07,311 --> 00:24:09,563
You call them "walkers"?

365
00:25:45,743 --> 00:25:47,611
( yelling )

366
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:49,863
( growling )

367
00:26:03,761 --> 00:26:05,578
You all right?
You cut or something?

368
00:26:05,579 --> 00:26:07,747
No, man, but my foot is caught.

369
00:26:07,748 --> 00:26:10,600
All right. He's just caught.
Come on, help me up.

370
00:26:10,601 --> 00:26:13,303
<i>- What happened? - Everyone's all right.</i>
<i>We're over in wine and beer.</i>

371
00:26:18,492 --> 00:26:20,443
( roof creaking )

372
00:26:20,444 --> 00:26:23,596
I was moving fast, man.
I drove right into the drinks.

373
00:26:23,597 --> 00:26:26,800
Man, you lucked out. If this thing had
come down on you the wrong way...

374
00:26:37,628 --> 00:26:39,913
( snarling )

375
00:26:39,914 --> 00:26:42,115
Yeah, uh, we should
probably go now.

376
00:26:42,116 --> 00:26:43,833
Bob's still stuck.
Get him out of there.

377
00:26:43,834 --> 00:26:45,502
We'll get the others.

378
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:04,521
Hey!

379
00:27:11,111 --> 00:27:15,281
I saw those sculptures
at the airport once.

380
00:27:15,282 --> 00:27:18,218
My favorite was the kids
playing leapfrog.

381
00:27:20,054 --> 00:27:22,188
Mine, too.

382
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:27,093
What Eddie and I had to do,

383
00:27:27,094 --> 00:27:29,646
did you do things like that?

384
00:27:33,067 --> 00:27:34,901
Did you?

385
00:27:38,939 --> 00:27:41,241
Do you think you get
to come back from them?

386
00:27:44,111 --> 00:27:46,746
I hope so.

387
00:27:46,747 --> 00:27:48,448
Yeah?

388
00:27:48,449 --> 00:27:51,284
I hope we answer
your three questions

389
00:27:51,285 --> 00:27:53,286
to your satisfaction.

390
00:27:55,489 --> 00:27:56,823
( growling )

391
00:28:10,387 --> 00:28:12,806
( grunting )

392
00:28:12,807 --> 00:28:15,892
( snarling )

393
00:28:21,615 --> 00:28:24,067
( grunting )

394
00:28:40,551 --> 00:28:43,503
( machine-gun gunfire )

395
00:28:43,504 --> 00:28:45,305
( clicks )

396
00:29:03,941 --> 00:29:06,242
Hey!

397
00:29:06,243 --> 00:29:08,328
( growling )

398
00:29:10,614 --> 00:29:12,248
Hey!

399
00:29:40,227 --> 00:29:41,311
Daryl, go!

400
00:29:54,825 --> 00:29:57,627
( gunfire )

401
00:29:57,628 --> 00:29:59,662
Let's get Bob.

402
00:30:06,954 --> 00:30:08,338
- ( grunting )
- Bob: More, more.

403
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:10,340
Come on, time to go.

404
00:30:10,341 --> 00:30:12,959
Let's go, now!
Come on! Go!

405
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,061
- <i>Let's get out of here!</i>
<i>- Ah!</i>

406
00:30:16,013 --> 00:30:17,797
( shouting )

407
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,986
( screaming )

408
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,355
- Zack!
- ( screaming )

409
00:30:28,826 --> 00:30:29,859
Go, go!

410
00:30:31,328 --> 00:30:33,446
Come on!

411
00:30:38,869 --> 00:30:40,870
It's just ahead.

412
00:30:43,324 --> 00:30:45,008
Eddie.

413
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:49,128
Oh, thank God
you're still here.

414
00:30:49,129 --> 00:30:50,797
This is Rick.

415
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:53,016
<i>He's gonna help us.</i>

416
00:30:55,402 --> 00:30:58,104
Everything's gonna be okay.

417
00:30:58,105 --> 00:31:01,340
Everything--
( breathing heavily )

418
00:31:05,178 --> 00:31:07,080
- <i>( blade scrapes )</i>
<i>- ( shouting )</i>

419
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:10,400
Damn it!

420
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:12,518
<i>( sobbing )</i>

421
00:31:15,406 --> 00:31:17,657
I wanted to take the boar.

422
00:31:17,658 --> 00:31:21,361
I just knew-- I knew I'd get
you here so much quicker.

423
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:25,798
He's starving.

424
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:29,002
He's slowing.
He needs something alive.

425
00:31:34,441 --> 00:31:38,011
Please, I told you,
I can't be without him.

426
00:31:40,914 --> 00:31:43,049
And so I kept him.

427
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:45,384
It was wrong.

428
00:31:45,385 --> 00:31:48,271
( breathing heavily )

429
00:31:48,272 --> 00:31:50,823
I can't do things like this.

430
00:31:51,992 --> 00:31:55,561
And-- and you have to do
things like this.

431
00:31:55,562 --> 00:31:57,780
<i>Let me be like him.</i>

432
00:31:57,781 --> 00:32:00,333
Don't stop it.

433
00:32:00,334 --> 00:32:02,452
Don't end it after.

434
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:04,921
- No.
- Let me be with him.

435
00:32:06,423 --> 00:32:07,623
No!

436
00:32:07,624 --> 00:32:10,293
( groans )

437
00:32:10,294 --> 00:32:12,628
( gasping )

438
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,468
( groans )

439
00:32:31,131 --> 00:32:32,899
Hey.

440
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:45,411
What were...

441
00:32:45,412 --> 00:32:47,580
the questions?

442
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:52,118
The three questions?

443
00:32:54,054 --> 00:32:56,556
How many walkers
have you killed?

444
00:33:03,296 --> 00:33:04,797
Eddie--

445
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:07,016
Eddie killed--
killed them all.

446
00:33:08,902 --> 00:33:10,903
Until...
( gasping )

447
00:33:15,308 --> 00:33:17,527
How many people
have you killed?

448
00:33:22,249 --> 00:33:24,667
Just me.

449
00:33:24,668 --> 00:33:26,419
Just me.

450
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:30,423
Why?

451
00:33:34,795 --> 00:33:37,830
<i>( gasping )</i>

452
00:33:42,502 --> 00:33:44,170
You don't--

453
00:33:44,171 --> 00:33:46,722
you don't get to come back.

454
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:51,644
You don't get to come back

455
00:33:51,645 --> 00:33:54,397
from things.

456
00:33:54,398 --> 00:33:56,482
You don't...

457
00:33:56,483 --> 00:33:58,517
( gasping )

458
00:34:25,779 --> 00:34:28,431
( growling )

459
00:34:38,423 --> 00:34:41,325
"The children fastened their eyes
upon their bit of candle

460
00:34:41,326 --> 00:34:45,395
and watched it melt
slowly and pitilessly away.

461
00:34:45,396 --> 00:34:49,266
Saw the half inch of wick
stand alone at last.

462
00:34:49,267 --> 00:34:52,002
Saw the feeble flame
rise and fall.

463
00:34:52,003 --> 00:34:55,555
Climb the thin tower of smoke.

464
00:34:55,556 --> 00:34:59,142
Linger at its top
a moment and then..."

465
00:35:05,566 --> 00:35:07,183
Ma'am, should I take watch now?

466
00:35:07,184 --> 00:35:09,369
Yes, Luke, you do that.

467
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:11,905
Today...

468
00:35:11,906 --> 00:35:15,025
we are talking about knives--
how to use them,

469
00:35:15,026 --> 00:35:17,628
how to be safe with them, and
how they could save your life.

470
00:35:17,629 --> 00:35:19,079
Patrick: <i>Ma'am,</i>
<i>may I be dismissed?</i>

471
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:22,366
- What is it?
- I'm not feeling very well.

472
00:35:22,367 --> 00:35:24,635
Sometimes you're gonna
have to fight through it.

473
00:35:24,636 --> 00:35:26,870
What if you wind up
out there alone?

474
00:35:26,871 --> 00:35:29,723
You just give up
because you're feeling bad?

475
00:35:29,724 --> 00:35:34,444
No, it's just I don't want
to yack on somebody.

476
00:35:36,147 --> 00:35:38,148
Go.

477
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,938
Okay, today we're gonna
learn how to hold a knife,

478
00:35:44,939 --> 00:35:49,726
how to stab and slash
and where to aim for.

479
00:35:54,699 --> 00:35:57,951
Please, don't tell your father.

480
00:36:06,477 --> 00:36:08,945
( growling )

481
00:36:13,084 --> 00:36:15,302
( growling )

482
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,684
What?

483
00:37:06,137 --> 00:37:08,188
I don't like going
out there, either.

484
00:37:17,314 --> 00:37:19,983
( sighs )
Daryl's telling Beth.

485
00:37:19,984 --> 00:37:22,152
There's nothing else to do.

486
00:37:23,538 --> 00:37:25,455
I'll go see her.

487
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,011
I'm not pregnant.

488
00:37:31,012 --> 00:37:33,213
- You know?
- I know.

489
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:37,834
- Oh, thank God.
- Yeah.

490
00:37:37,835 --> 00:37:39,853
Oh, my God.

491
00:37:39,854 --> 00:37:43,673
I didn't want to,
but we could have.

492
00:37:45,676 --> 00:37:47,177
We can have lives here.

493
00:37:47,178 --> 00:37:51,448
How can you say that
after today?

494
00:37:51,449 --> 00:37:53,150
After Lori?

495
00:37:53,151 --> 00:37:56,186
Because I don't want to be
afraid of being alive.

496
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:03,193
Being afraid
is what's kept us alive.

497
00:38:03,194 --> 00:38:05,796
No.

498
00:38:05,797 --> 00:38:07,798
It's how we kept breathing.

499
00:38:15,256 --> 00:38:16,807
Hey.

500
00:38:16,808 --> 00:38:18,758
Hi.

501
00:38:21,479 --> 00:38:23,263
What is it?

502
00:38:23,264 --> 00:38:25,182
( sighs )

503
00:38:25,183 --> 00:38:27,150
Zack.

504
00:38:32,223 --> 00:38:33,723
Is he dead?

505
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,167
Okay.

506
00:39:04,388 --> 00:39:05,889
What?

507
00:39:11,646 --> 00:39:13,864
I don't cry anymore, Daryl.

508
00:39:16,284 --> 00:39:19,119
I'm just glad I got
to know him, you know?

509
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,154
Me, too.

510
00:39:23,958 --> 00:39:25,441
Are you okay?

511
00:39:27,111 --> 00:39:30,213
Just tired of losing
people is all.

512
00:39:37,288 --> 00:39:39,256
I'm glad I didn't
say good-bye.

513
00:39:39,257 --> 00:39:42,008
I hate good-byes.

514
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,930
Me, too.

515
00:40:03,948 --> 00:40:06,166
You tried to help her.

516
00:40:06,167 --> 00:40:09,085
You couldn't.
No one could.

517
00:40:09,086 --> 00:40:11,988
Some people are too far gone.

518
00:40:11,989 --> 00:40:13,990
You're not.

519
00:40:13,991 --> 00:40:15,792
You tried to help her.

520
00:40:15,793 --> 00:40:17,928
How that woman wound up,

521
00:40:17,929 --> 00:40:20,046
I got close to that.

522
00:40:22,049 --> 00:40:24,017
If I lost Carl and Judith,

523
00:40:24,018 --> 00:40:25,501
if I lost this place--

524
00:40:25,502 --> 00:40:28,355
Not then, Rick.
Not even then.

525
00:40:30,341 --> 00:40:32,842
You came back.

526
00:40:32,843 --> 00:40:34,894
Your boy came back.

527
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,698
You get to come back.
You do.

528
00:40:47,024 --> 00:40:50,193
( sighs )

529
00:40:50,194 --> 00:40:52,195
