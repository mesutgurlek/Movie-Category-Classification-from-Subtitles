00:26:20,414 --> 00:26:21,954
Hell.

324
00:26:23,494 --> 00:26:25,754
CORRIE: We'll need another
bike for you, Fi.

325
00:26:25,814 --> 00:26:27,234
I can walk to yours.

326
00:26:28,973 --> 00:26:33,033
- I can't ride a bike.
- Come on, we can both get on this.

327
00:26:36,933 --> 00:26:41,153
- Ready? You OK?
- Yeah, I think so.

328
00:26:44,733 --> 00:26:47,673
SOLDIER: Keep this area clear!

329
00:26:47,733 --> 00:26:49,753
SOLDIER 2: Move back
from the gates!

330
00:26:49,813 --> 00:26:52,153
Rations. Food rations.

331
00:26:52,213 --> 00:26:55,072
Remember, only one
ration pack per person.

332
00:26:55,132 --> 00:26:56,552
I need you to talk
to your friend.

333
00:26:56,612 --> 00:26:57,792
Oh, yeah, what friend
might that be?

334
00:26:57,852 --> 00:26:58,992
Come on, George.

335
00:26:59,052 --> 00:27:01,092
You need to convince them
to let us move the cattle.

336
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:05,552
I know you've been getting these
things longer than anybody else.

337
00:27:05,612 --> 00:27:08,552
People won't like that, George.

338
00:27:08,612 --> 00:27:11,672
We have to find the kids.
Jack's got a plan to get us out.

339
00:27:11,732 --> 00:27:14,112
There's bush behind the abattoir.

340
00:27:14,172 --> 00:27:15,792
We overpower the guards
and do a runner.

341
00:27:15,852 --> 00:27:17,552
- They'll shoot us!
- The kids built a bomb, George.

342
00:27:17,612 --> 00:27:19,131
They're going to get
themselves killed.

343
00:27:19,171 --> 00:27:21,231
You're going to get yourself
killed, that's what'll happen.

344
00:27:21,291 --> 00:27:22,451
- George!
- No. You know what?

345
00:27:22,491 --> 00:27:24,031
We don't even know that
Homer's with Ellie, OK?

346
00:27:24,091 --> 00:27:25,831
- Where else would he be?
- How the hell should I know?

347
00:27:25,891 --> 00:27:27,559
- Righto, Liz.
- Exactly. You never know where he is.

348
00:27:27,611 --> 00:27:29,911
No, you know what? That's it.
I'm done. I'm out of this.

349
00:27:36,891 --> 00:27:38,831
Can I borrow this?
I'll give it back to you.

350
00:27:39,931 --> 00:27:43,790
These aren't enough. People
need something to sustain them.

351
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:45,990
If you don't look after
the cattle, they'll die.

352
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:50,910
You're left with rotten
carcasses, disease.

353
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:52,830
There's an abattoir
on the edge of town.

354
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:57,990
Take the cattle there,
all of us, you included.

355
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,830
Stay fed. Stay healthy.

356
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:03,590
I'm a cattle farmer.
I can take 'em.

I wasn't trying to be funny.
I-I heard footsteps.

- I thought it was soldiers.
- Fair call.

from shop to shop soon.

Sort of.

- I'll give it a shot.

red target on our backs.

480
00:38:25,505 --> 00:38:26,685
(VEHICLE APPROACHES)

481
00:38:34,385 --> 00:38:37,444
- Homer, it's Dad!
- Wait, that's Fi's father.

482
00:38:40,104 --> 00:38:42,404
Dad! Dad!

483
00:38:42,464 --> 00:38:46,524
Stop waving! They'll see us!
What are you doing?

484
00:38:46,584 --> 00:38:48,644
- Don't!
- We can't do anything!

485
00:38:48,704 --> 00:38:50,044
Don't!

486
00:38:50,104 --> 00:38:54,564
Ellie, listen to me!
Listen. This is serious.

487
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:56,124
If you get out of this truck,

488
00:38:56,184 --> 00:38:59,284
those soldiers aren't going
to wait and ask questions.

489
00:38:59,344 --> 00:39:01,043
Let it go, Ellie.

490
00:39:01,103 --> 00:39:02,923
You can't risk your life.

491
00:39:02,983 --> 00:39:05,123
Or his.

492
00:39:05,183 --> 00:39:07,483
Let it go.

493
00:39:21,583 --> 00:39:24,803
MAN: We need a doctor!
Injured man here!

494
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:27,282
- We need help now!
- OK, OK. OK, stand back. Stand back.

495
00:39:29,382 --> 00:39:31,021
Hello, hello, can you hear me?

496
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:33,350
What is his name?
Has he been shot?

497
00:39:34,902 --> 00:39:37,442
I need a gurney now.
Nurse! Nurse!

498
00:39:37,502 --> 00:39:38,762
Gurney, now. Now!

499
00:39:40,022 --> 00:39:41,882
WOMAN: Out of the way!
Coming through.

500
00:39:41,942 --> 00:39:44,682
MAN: Everyone, get back in the room.
Get back in the room!

501
00:39:45,942 --> 00:39:50,161
Therese. It's going to be OK.
This'll ease the pain.

502
00:39:58,981 --> 00:40:02,761
(GASPS)

503
00:40:15,141 --> 00:40:17,040
WOMAN: Get out of the way.

504
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:22,160
MAN: Keep this area clear.

505
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,960
Did she say anything?

506
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,960
She told me you were
a wonderful husband.

507
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,160
SOLDIER: Keep moving.

508
00:40:54,379 --> 00:40:58,479
The hospital's informed me that
the soldier with the burns has died.

509
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:03,759
The helicopters have moved further
out, as you instructed, sir.

510
00:41:05,778 --> 00:41:08,758
- And the cows have gone.
- Gone?

511
00:41:08,818 --> 00:41:12,398
To the abattoir. Some prisoners
volunteered to take them.

512
00:41:12,458 --> 00:41:14,238
Which prisoners?

513
00:41:28,538 --> 00:41:30,778
MAN: (OVER LOUDSPEAKER)
You are to pull over immediately.

514
00:41:30,817 --> 00:41:34,077
I repeat, you are to pull
over and stop immediately.

515
00:41:34,137 --> 00:41:35,757
Do you copy?

516
00:41:40,377 --> 00:41:42,277
What if they don't come back?

517
00:41:42,337 --> 00:41:44,197
ROBYN: We have to
believe they will.

518
00:41:50,497 --> 00:41:52,757
This used to be my
favourite time of day.

519
00:41:56,176 --> 00:41:59,316
Her mother was sick after she was
born and couldn't raise her.

520
00:42:01,536 --> 00:42:03,316
So I did the hand-raising thing.

521
00:42:05,976 --> 00:42:07,836
I was little, so was she.

522
00:42:16,416 --> 00:42:19,036
She taught me how to
care for something.

523
00:42:21,695 --> 00:42:23,555
I hope she gets better.

524
00:42:47,494 --> 00:42:50,674
As requested, sir, the cattle's
been delivered to the abattoir

525
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:52,414
and the prisoners
returned to the compound.

526
00:42:53,414 --> 00:42:56,394
And we now have the
addresses of the children.

527
00:43:14,013 --> 00:43:15,993
(COW LOWS)

528
00:43:17,773 --> 00:43:21,473
SOLDIER: Fiona Maxwell.

530
00:43:26,213 --> 00:43:29,633

531
00:43:29,693 --> 00:43:33,873
Eleanor Linton.

532
00:43:33,933 --> 00:43:38,032
Homer Ianos.
140 Waratah Drive.

533
00:43:38,092 --> 00:43:41,952
Corrie McKenzie.
9 Ironbark Road.

534
00:43:43,492 --> 00:43:45,032
Kill them.

535
00:43:52,812 --> 00:43:54,512
(GUNSHOT)

536
