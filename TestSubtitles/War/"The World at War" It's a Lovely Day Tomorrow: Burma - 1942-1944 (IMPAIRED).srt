2
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,752
(narrator) Monsoon in Burma.

3
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,718
(man) If you can imagine the heaviest
rain you'd ever get in this country

4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,557
going on for six to eight weeks without
a break, this was monsoon period.

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,871
(narrator) Five months in every year.

6
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,680
(man #2) Squashing through mud, living
in mud, lying in mud and sleeping in mud

7
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,115
and drinking in mud and eating in mud.

8
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,795
That was the monsoon in Burma,
and it's just a nightmare.

9
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,993
(narrator) War in Burma made up
in ferocity what it lacked in scale.

10
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,198
Here, in 1944, in these conditions,

11
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:04,389
the British were defending the frontiers
of India against the Japanese.

12
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,031
(bird calls)

13
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:20,077
(narrator) The Burmese jungle -
a steam bath, closing out the sky.

14
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:26,471
Dense, imprisoning...
and a long way from home.

15
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,069
I'd never seen a jungle. I'd seen
a forest, but I hadn't seen a jungle.

16
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:36,871
We went in there,
it was dark, dirty, damp, rain,

17
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,033
there were all sorts of animal noises
that we'd never heard before...

18
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,190
In fact, it was really scary.

19
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,998
I liked the jungle.

20
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:50,871
It did not have the fear it seems
to have had for some Allied soldiers.

21
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,999
It was a friendly place - dark,
where you could camouflage yourself.

22
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,239
(narrator) Burma:
jagged mountain and fetid swamp,

23
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:07,155
clothed in jungle
and scored by steep river valleys.

24
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:16,471
Burma: endless green growth
spawning every kind of disease -

25
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,997
malaria, dysentery, scrub typhus,

26
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,993
dengue fever, prickly heat -

27
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,390
particularly in monsoon.

28
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,711
Mud. It might have been Flanders
in the First World War.

29
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:44,234
The monsoon in Burma turned camps
into swamps, roads into quagmires.

30
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:54,318
After the rains, the country
was just one great bowl of mud.

31
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,432
For the British,
Burma was a shield and barrier

32
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,796
protecting their Indian empire.

33
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,474
The Japanese saw they could use Burma

34
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,750
to screen their new territorial gains

35
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,478
in Southeast Asia,

36
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,279
to cut the Allied supply route
to China,

37
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,359
and to secure new sources
of oil and rice.

38
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,671
In December 1941, they invaded.

39
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,035
They had the advantage of surprise,

40
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,950
and, for this jungle war,
they were thoroughly prepared.

41
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,239
I don't think any country

42
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,313
could have been more unprepared for war

43
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,278
than Burma was at this particular time.

44
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,476
The government was unprepared,

45
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,270
the civil organisation
and the people were unprepared,

46
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:51,434
and the defence forces
practically didn't exist.

47
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:57,552
Some of the Gurkha who came along had
400 recruits straight from the depot,

48
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:03,875
and the British had been milked
of reinforcements and officers to Europe

49
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,714
and, you might say,
only the dull left behind.

50
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,798
(narrator) The Japanese from the start
swept all before them.

51
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,797
They used the jungle
to outmarch and outmanoeuvre

52
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,031
Britain's weak Burma army.

53
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,557
The British retreated in confusion.

54
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:51,353
It was a crashing disadvantage to me
in the 1942 campaign

55
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,273
in that I hadn't got a wireless set

56
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,718
which would contact
my air support in Rangoon,

57
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,189
and, therefore, believe it or not,

58
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,989
the only thing I could do was to tap in

59
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,710
onto the railway telephone line,

60
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,590
get the babu
in the post office in Rangoon,

61
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,719
and try and persuade him
that it was vitally important

62
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,635
for me to be put on
to air force headquarters.

63
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,315
And that was really
one of the reasons why,

64
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,598
in our withdrawal to the Sittang,

65
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,110
we were
terribly badly bombed by the RAF

66
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,670
as well as by the Japanese air force.

67
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,070
(narrator) The Japanese
had heavy air superiority.

68
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,720
They bombed and strafed almost at will,

69
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,157
spreading terror
among raw troops and civilians.

70
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,032
Only a small force
of American volunteers

71
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,680
and the few RAF planes
that were in Burma

72
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,514
challenged their dominance
and rose to battle with them.

73
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,636
The damage the Japanese bombers dealt
was, as much as anything, psychological.

74
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,918
People couldn't believe
this was happening to peaceful Burma.

75
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:47,511
Resistance, valiant at times,
was swept aside.

76
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,875
I was discharged from hospital
at Mandalay

77
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,671
having broken three ribs - left
absolutely stranded on the roadside.

78
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,671
And a civilian picked me up,

79
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,591
took me home to his house,

80
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,593
and said what did I do?
And I said, "I'm catering."

81
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,908
He said, "If you like,

82
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,956
come to our house and cook for us."

83
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,712
We were there two hours,

84
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,994
no more than that,

85
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,071
when the message came through:

86
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,594
"Evacuate, the Japanese are here."

87
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,873
(narrator)
The Japanese march north continued,

88
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,590
leaving a trail of chaos and destruction
the length of Burma.

89
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,634
The British retreated.

90
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,473
(Bowers) I had nothing,
only what I stood up in.

91
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:48,669
I raided someone's kit, found a stout
pair of boots, and we began to walk.

92
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,955
(narrator) In the mounting confusion,
the wounded were a problem.

93
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,555
(man) We had to leave giving treatment
and just bandage up,

94
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,473
do the best we could.
Some we had to leave behind.

95
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,435
Others we put on transport to get them
on the roads - this was all we could do.

96
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,751
And eventually we had
to finally give it up as a bad job

97
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,432
and make our own way out,

98
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,876
as we were only 24 hours
in front of the Japanese

99
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,269
through the length and breadth of Burma.

100
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,990
(narrator) The Japanese
took everything in their stride.

101
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:49,757
Ahead of them, the last recourse
of a retreating army: scorched earth.

102
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,992
The invaders seemed
to have made the jungle their friend.

103
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,669
They were racing
to win the rich prize of Burma's oil -

104
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,593
but found instead a blazing inferno.

105
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:14,392
At one installation, £11 million worth
of oil and plant went up in 70 minutes.

106
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,757
Refugees: Eurasians, Chinese, Indians.

107
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,359
(Bowers) Indians we saw die on the
roadside - we could do nothing about it.

108
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,558
We just had to
think about ourselves and go on.

109
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,834
(man) The Japanese
were driving Burma people -

110
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,913
in their thousands they came through.
There were some terrible sights.

111
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,598
Men were left behind,

112
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,912
and it was heart-breaking to see them
being separated from their people,

113
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,232
wondering whether they'd meet up again.
They were dying in their hundreds.

114
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,476
All you used to do was pile 'em up,

115
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,154
throw petrol over them
and set fire to them

116
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,959
and that was the end of those.

117
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,112
(man) We had to hack
through virgin jungle practically

118
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:23,196
to get out of that country,
and we had to find our own way to India.

119
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:27,193
I think the overall impression I had
of that horrible trek out of Burma

120
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,556
was that it seemed to bring the best
and worst out of people.

121
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,995
Some people who I'd looked up to

122
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,155
and respected

123
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,196
I found I couldn't respect any more

124
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:41,354
because they became
entirely different on that march.

125
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,112
In fact, I felt that it was

126
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,879
a question of survival of the fittest.

127
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:53,795
(narrator) British prisoners -
5,000 in one engagement alone.

128
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,997
The Japanese despised
those who surrendered.

129
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,675
They believed
soldiers should fight to the death.

130
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,191
(Okada) We felt the British officer
was a very good fighter -

131
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:10,912
all of the ones we captured, they always
said to me, "We will win the war."

132
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,431
Now this I couldn't understand, because
here is a man who has surrendered

133
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,512
and he still says,
"We will win the war."

134
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,557
(triumphal music)

135
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,995
Through the deserted cities of Burma,

136
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,753
the conquering Japanese
marched in triumph.

137
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,636
The Burmese people were now exchanging
one set of imperial masters for another.

138
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,631
(shouting in Japanese)

139
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,352
In five months, by May 1942,

140
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,477
the Japanese
chased the British up past Rangoon,

141
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,074
through the Irrawaddy
and Chindwin valleys,

142
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,673
to the frontiers of India

143
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,109
and out of Burma altogether.

144
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:18,273
It was the longest retreat
in British history.

145
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,392
The Japanese also drove another army,
the Chinese,

146
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,835
up to Mandalay towards China.

147
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,673
The Chinese,
at war with Japan since 1931,

148
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,796
were protecting their supply line,

149
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,950
the Burma Road.

150
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,992
China was allied to the western powers.

151
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:40,234
In command of Chinese forces in Burma
was the American, General Stilwell.

152
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,876
Stilwell, chief of staff to the Chinese
supreme commander Chiang Kai-shek,

153
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,032
watched America's interests.

154
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,755
The commander-in-chief, India,
was General Wavell.

155
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,796
Transferred from the Middle East,

156
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,998
he now faced a formidable foe
with scanty resources.

157
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:03,039
But while his Burma army licked
its wounds, he planned a comeback,

158
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,669
a limited offensive for late in 1942.

159
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,632
Wavell chose to mount this offensive
in the Arakan,

160
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,632
on the Bay of Bengal,
near the Indian Border.

161
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,713
After a hopeful beginning,
everything went wrong.

162
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,792
The British were outmanoeuvred
and outfought again,

163
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,514
and pushed back to their starting point.

164
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,194
They still had not learned
to adapt to the jungle.

165
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:35,319
In the Burmese jungle, fortunately,
there are many bamboo growths,

166
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,710
and in Japan we all eat bamboo shoots,

167
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,873
so there was a lot of natural food
in the form of bamboo shoots

168
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,518
all over the place.

169
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:50,232
Apart from that, we all know that
what a monkey can eat, we can eat too.

170
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,915
So if you watch the monkeys
and avoid what the monkeys avoid,

171
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,036
you are fairly safe.

172
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:01,148
Apart from that there are such creatures
as bandicoots - a type of rat, you see -

173
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,994
snakes, jungle lizards and tokay -
small lizards -

174
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,878
you cut off the head, chop them up
and make into curry,

175
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,838
mixed with pepper, can make good curry.

176
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,316
We have our meats
and Yorkshire puddings and so forth -

177
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,231
they lived on rice.

178
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,472
You can't get meat and Yorkshire pudding
and greens and potatoes out there,

179
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,120
so we had to reorganise ourselves

180
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,590
and lived on the things
that the army could produce for us,

181
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,193
Iike corned beef.

182
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,550
And this is the only place I know

183
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:34,269
where you could open a tin of corned
beef and pour it out like a liquid.

184
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,073
(narrator) One man
who was going to use the jungle:

185
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,799
Orde Wingate,
an experienced guerrilla fighter,

186
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,714
supremely unorthodox,
with a touch of the fanatic.

187
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:51,035
Now he planned a raid deep in enemy
territory, to be supplied from the air.

188
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,510
He commanded the Chindits,
ordinary British and Gurkha troops,

189
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:58,030
but intensively trained.

190
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,559
(Calvert) The first operation
was initially

191
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:06,634
to accompany
a general advance into Burma,

192
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,473
but the general advance was cancelled.

193
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:14,998
However, Wavell wanted
the expedition to go forward.

194
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:20,556
(narrator) February 1943:
the first Chindit expedition.

195
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,995
The going could not have been worse -

196
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:29,872
long distances in dense, hilly jungle,
and always one more river to cross.

197
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,389
The heat was extreme,
drinking water was short,

198
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,994
and malaria was rampant.

199
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,356
But at last the British were fighting
as the enemy did,

200
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,230
learning to turn the jungle to their
own advantage - but still hating it.

201
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:07,395
(man) The heat and the smell
of the jungle was vile. Very vile.

202
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:14,431
You couldn't live in the jungle for an
eternity - you'd never stand the smell.

203
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,990
(man #2) Even when you went downhill,
you knew you had to go up again,

204
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,799
and we were carrying
60 to 70 pounds on our back,

205
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,792
five days' rations
plus arms, ammunition.

206
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,997
You'd think, "Oh, will it ever end?"

207
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,355
It just went on and on and on,

208
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:39,113
and the rain - and, of course, the fear
that you would be ambushed or attacked.

209
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:49,552
It was absolute hell
in the first Wingate expedition,

210
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:55,277
where the jungle was the friend
of the Japanese, but our enemy.

211
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,110
(man #1) We were wet all the time,

212
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,079
and while we were wet
we got the leech onto our bodies.

213
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,994
They were there all the time
because of the dampness of it.

214
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,311
They got onto your body,
sucked the blood from your body,

215
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,830
and unless you burnt them the right way
with the cigarette end,

216
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:16,674
they fell off and left black spots
all over your body.

217
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,753
Once they had their fill of blood,
they dropped from your body

218
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:26,278
and burst inside your clothes,
and you were smothered in blood.

219
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,870
(man #2) The thought that
you'd get wounded and be left behind,

220
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,112
that was always in our minds, I think -
I'm sure it was in most people's minds.

221
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,589
I saw chaps having to be left behind -

222
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:50,231
hand grenade, pistol, flask of water,

223
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,198
water bottle, rations -

224
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,829
and propped up against a tree, left.

225
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,679
(narrator) 450 died.

226
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,037
For some, a simple cross
in a jungle clearing.

227
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,837
In June, after four months,
the first Chindits returned from Burma.

228
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:20,119
Out of the 3,000 men who had gone in,
less than 2,000 came back.

229
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:26,230
Weary and emaciated, most
had marched a thousand jungle miles.

230
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,356
Whatever the expedition's
military results,

231
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,592
it did teach valuable lessons
in jungle operations,

232
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,439
in air supply, and in morale.

233
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,792
(Calvert) This was a raid. Its tactical
and strategical effect was not great.

234
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:52,238
Its main effect was on the morale
of the British and Indian troops.

235
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,993
Our forces were not picked men,

236
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,675
they were ordinary
British and Gurkha battalions,

237
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,394
and the rest of the army said, "My God,

238
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,789
if those people can do it, we can."

239
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,872
(narrator) Very slowly, the British
were getting the measure of the jungle.

240
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,430
They loathed its stench,
its sticky heat.

241
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,990
It was hard for them to realise
that the jungle was neutral.

242
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,471
(Japanese man, calling out in English)
Hello, Tommy! Where are you?

243
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,671
Hello, Tommy! Where are you?

244
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,869
I have been hit. Come and help me.

245
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,278
(narrator) The enemy carried on
a crude but effective war of nerves.

246
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,638
The troops still thought of the Japanese
soldier as master of the jungle,

247
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,268
a man who could go for days
on a handful of rice,

248
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,158
didn't seem to know the meaning of fear,

249
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:52,394
would never surrender,
was perhaps unbeatable.

250
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,112
(mocking laughter)

251
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,270
A sort of superman.

252
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,753
The Japanese was a good soldier.
He was a good soldier.

253
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,674
If he was told to do a job,
he would stop there until he died.

254
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,391
Animals.

255
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,950
But great soldiers,
great fighting soldiers.

256
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,430
Their battle drill was fantastic.
You couldn't help but admire them.

257
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,149
If they were ambushed,
they were at you -

258
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:28,835
in 20 or 30 seconds they were
pounding you with their mortars,

259
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,480
and in frontal attacks
nobody could beat them.

260
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,989
They would just come on and on and on.

261
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,277
He hadn't the mentality, I suppose,
to think for himself.

262
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,839
He just obeyed orders.

263
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:44,517
And he came at you with everything he
had, even if it meant losing his life.

264
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,955
He just... he didn't care about life.

265
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,439
We were taught from the very beginning

266
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:55,036
that we must...
our life is the emperor's.

267
00:21:55,160 --> 00:22:00,234
For instance, when I left for war duty,

268
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,436
I had to clip my nails and hair

269
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,590
and write a last will and testament,

270
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,193
because from that moment

271
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,073
our lives are in the emperor's hands.

272
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,639
In other words,

273
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,712
my family will put that in the urn

274
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,473
in case my body is not recovered.

275
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:20,030
So our training
is to die for the emperor, you see.

276
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,433
(mournful Japanese song)

277
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:15,676
We had what we called officers' clubs,
where there were Japanese geishas.

278
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,399
These were mostly for officer grade.

279
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:26,239
For the other ranks, we had
what you might call "comfort girls".

280
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:33,230
And, of course,
in the officers' parties you all drank -

281
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:38,073
the thing was to get drunk
very quickly, sing songs,

282
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,549
and because of
the limitation of the girls,

283
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,438
only the high officers got them later.

284
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,511
But the songs would be like...

285
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,275
I think the English have a song
called "Roll Me Over in the Clover",

286
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,555
and you go "One, two, three, four..."

287
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:55,553
Our songs are very similar - it's always
"One, two, three," like this.

288
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,757
And similar in content, too.

289
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:04,312
For the enlisted men,
our entertainment...

290
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:10,077
Because you're entertaining only
between battles or on one day's leave,

291
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:14,995
and you may die next day, we don't have
much time for any lengthy entertainment,

292
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,277
we go straight to the comfort girls.

293
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:24,310
You pay your money and you come out
feeling refreshed and like a new man.

294
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,913
Most of the comfort girls
for the enlisted men,

295
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,353
many were Koreans,

296
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,670
and I must say
I respect all of them very much,

297
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,274
because who else
would come to the front line

298
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,478
to give us the last entertainment

299
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,996
for many of us on this earth?

300
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:47,113
(narrator) The British had their own,
very different, entertainment.

301
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,350
(Vera Lynn)
Burma was the furthest point

302
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,000
and very few artists were going there,

303
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,196
so I said, "Right, that's for me."

304
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,518
They thought they were the forgotten
army and I think they probably were.

305
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,668
In fact, just for them to see me
was quite a lot to them,

306
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,993
because that I had gone
to all the trouble

307
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:12,436
and travelled so far just to see them

308
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:17,071
made them feel that they weren't
a long way from home, you know.

309
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,760
If I could pop on a plane
and nip out there,

310
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,469
they weren't too far away
and not forgotten.

311
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:28,076
(narrator) In this jungle stalemate,
the message was certainly welcome.

312
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,391
( "It's a Lovely Day Tomorrow")

313
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:51,919
It's a lovely day tomorrow

314
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:58,553
Tomorrow is a lovely day

315
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:05,637
Come and feast
your tear-dimmed eyes

316
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:12,592
On tomorrow's clear blue skies

317
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:20,035
If today your heart is weary

318
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:26,309
If every little thing looks grey

319
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,552
Just forget your troubles

320
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:36,749
And learn to say

321
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:49,790
Tomorrow is a lovely day

322
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:59,032
(narrator) October 1943.
Things are looking up.

323
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,078
Lord Louis Mountbatten arrives
as supreme commander

324
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,958
of a newly created
Southeast Asia Command.

325
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:10,319
His mission: to end the stalemate
and knock out the Japanese.

326
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,109
Mountbatten's immediate aim
was to rebuild morale

327
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:21,513
in an army that felt itself forgotten
and wondered why it was there.

328
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:27,596
"We shall march, fight and fly
through the monsoon," he declared.

329
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:32,799
Another new appointment:
General Bill Slim,

330
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:36,276
commander
of the newly formed 14th Army.

331
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:40,353
He knew Burma,
and he knew the Japanese.

332
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,431
Bill Slim was essentially
a soldier's general.

333
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,875
Watchful of his troops' well-being,

334
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,714
he wanted them fit
and ready to go over to the attack.

335
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,792
Bless 'em all, bless 'em all

336
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,158
The long and the short
and the tall...

337
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:14,869
(narrator) "The long and the short
and the tall" were, in this case,

338
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,190
two-thirds of them Indian troops.

339
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:23,233
Cos we're saying goodbye to them all

340
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:27,199
As back to their billets they crawl

341
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:31,478
You 'll get no promotion
this side of the ocean

342
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:35,633
So cheer up, my lads
Bless 'em all

343
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,356
(narrator) Malaria.

344
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,908
At the First Arakan
th is, and other diseases,

345
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,516
had claimed 120 victims
to every battle casualty.

346
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,795
(man) I had malaria 17 times.

347
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,599
The last time they thought
I had spinal malaria -

348
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,433
I couldn't walk
and I couldn't even move my arms.

349
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:58,839
And I was getting inoculations all day
and every day, three times a day.

350
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,034
(narrator)
To stamp out the scourge at source,

351
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,918
clouds of a new insecticide, DDT,

352
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,310
were sprayed over
the swampy breeding grounds.

353
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:23,711
December 1943:
a second offensive at Arakan.

354
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,069
The Japanese counter-attacked.

355
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,270
One enemy force advanced north,

356
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,918
wheeled behind the British,

357
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,560
and turned west to capture Ngakyedauk -

358
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,393
or "Okedoke" - Pass.

359
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,270
Another split the British divisions
and encircled one of them.

360
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:54,430
British and Indian units, trapped in
a small enclave, fought for their lives.

361
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,237
Isolated groups fought on, surrounded.

362
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:07,999
The skeleton force held out
against an entire Japanese division

363
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,834
in what came to be known
as "The Admin Box".

364
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:16,875
Clerks, mechanics, drivers,
even a general, joined in.

365
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:22,239
In the first Arakan operation,
the troops had withdrawn.

366
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:27,314
Now, on Slim's express orders,
there was no withdrawal.

367
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,392
They were supplied from the air.

368
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:39,950
By day and night, the planes
of Troop Carrier Command flew in

369
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,759
to drop essential stores.

370
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:56,555
What seemed certain defeat was
averted by this tactic of air supply.

371
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,793
Casualties were heavy.

372
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:11,152
The wounded were tended
in improvised dressing stations.

373
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:17,076
Surgeons performed major operations
in sweating heat, plagued by flies.

374
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,390
(flies buzzing)

375
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,039
At one field hospital, doctors,
medical orderlies and wounded alike

376
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,953
were butchered by Japanese.

377
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,153
The sufferings of prisoners
taken by the Japanese

378
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,549
also stirred the troops to fury.

379
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:07,829
Thousands of Allied prisoners of war
slaved and died

380
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,990
building the Burma Railway.

381
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:15,675
(man) They captured us,
and from then on we were no longer men.

382
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:22,234
(man #2) They literally
despised us for giving in.

383
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,389
(man #1) We didn't have the food.

384
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,871
We had to work
anything up to 16, 18 hours a day.

385
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,634
(man #2) If you argued with one,
if you hit one,

386
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:43,271
you automatically got six set about you.

387
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:48,789
And they thought nothing of beating you
until your arm was broke

388
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,872
or your leg was broke.

389
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:56,715
(man #1) They'd stand him outside
the guard room in the blazing sun,

390
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:00,150
take a great delight in pricking him
with a bayonet point

391
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,595
to make him stand upright.

392
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,268
(man #3) There were men
with terrible ulcers,

393
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:14,319
and the only treatment they had
was dropping maggots onto the ulcers

394
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:18,234
and letting the maggots eat out the pus
and clean the ulcers out.

395
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,630
That's the only treatment
we had for them.

396
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:26,953
(man #1) To find a chap that was
12 stone down to about five stone

397
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,999
and crawling about trying to beg
for food or scrambling for food...

398
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:34,356
I mean, it took some living with.

399
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:39,192
(man #4) At that time
I was going to the toilet on all fours

400
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,078
cos my bowels had dropped.

401
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:45,277
(man #2) The latrines were concrete -

402
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,751
the top was just
one absolute sea of maggots.

403
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:53,031
This chap in particular
was in such a bad way -

404
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,236
I think it was cerebral malaria -

405
00:33:55,320 --> 00:34:01,236
that they found him with his head
down there. He'd committed suicide.

406
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,877
(man #1) A very close friend of mine,
in my own regiment,

407
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,829
he'd suffered from everything
from beriberi, cholera...

408
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:21,192
When he died, he was just skin -
skin over a skeleton and nothing else.

409
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:24,392
His legs had been eaten away
with ulcers.

410
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,598
And there was just nothing of him.
I only just recognised him.

411
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:37,799
And there were 16,000 died
just on the railway.

412
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:41,759
For every sleeper that was laid,
there was a human life given up.

413
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:45,753
With the proper food, proper treatment,
we could have carried on,

414
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:49,555
built their blasted railway
and thought nothing of it.

415
00:34:55,480 --> 00:35:01,032
(man #2) I could never understand
people being like that -

416
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:06,311
so terrible in things that they'd done,

417
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:10,272
and the sadistic nature of them.

418
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:16,037
Thinking of this, I felt sorry for 'em
as much as anything.

419
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,359
(gunshots)

420
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:38,352
(narrator) Japanese troops
would die rather than surrender,

421
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,557
dig themselves in, resist to the end.

422
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,555
But now, a change.

423
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:50,077
At Arakan, some Japanese
gave themselves up. They'd had enough.

424
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:55,917
The superman myth was exploded -
these troops were not unbeatable.

425
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,596
But many Japanese wounded
still took the traditional way out.

426
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,679
(Okada) It was almost impossible
to take care of the wounded,

427
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,352
and the wounded, knowing this,

428
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:10,877
would ask their comrades to give them
a grenade so they can commit suicide,

429
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,633
and maybe three or four wounded
who could not walk

430
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:17,190
could commit suicide that way.

431
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,475
(man) We picked up a number of Japanese
who'd been badly shot up.

432
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:31,639
It was quite necessary in our field
hospitals to tie their hands down,

433
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,438
because if you didn't do that,

434
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,274
they merely tore at their bandages,
opened their wounds

435
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,989
and literally tried to commit suicide.

436
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,438
(narrator) Late in 1943,

437
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,835
from Ledo on the India-Burma border,

438
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,195
Stilwell and the Chinese advanced

439
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,510
to open the way for a new route,

440
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,669
the Ledo Road,

441
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,957
joining the old Burma Road at Bhamo.

442
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,514
The Chinese had to fight
to clear the path

443
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:09,115
which would lead them back to China.

444
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:16,358
Stilwell's two divisions went ahead,
seeking out the enemy.

445
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:42,989
Edging southeastwards, in three hard
months they killed 4,000 Japanese.

446
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:52,038
Behind them came the engineers,
blasting as they went...

447
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:02,277
and, in their thousands, the labourers
who would build the highway.

448
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:14,069
The Ledo Road, driven hundreds of miles
through atrocious country,

449
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:18,153
was to ensure continued supplies
to China.

450
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:26,230
For Stilwell's troops, conditions
were as hard as anywhere in Burma.

451
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,598
From Wingate, too, a new offensive.

452
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,591
Promoted general, he was to lead,

453
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:43,717
despite opposition
from more orthodox colleagues,

454
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:47,549
a second Chindit expedition
to the interior.

455
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:52,509
They flew in
and were again supplied from the air.

456
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,469
March 1944: Operation Thursday.

457
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:04,308
Air transport for 10,000 men
and 1,000 pack animals, with stores,

458
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:08,638
to jungle sites deep in enemy territory.

459
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:41,475
Landing so many gliders in rough,
hostile country was a formidable hazard.

460
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,677
Guerrilla fighting was new
to most of them.

461
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,038
In spite of their training,
this was a venture into the unknown.

462
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:30,150
(Calvert) The second Wingate operation
was ten times the size of the first.

463
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:36,879
The object was, in effect, to cut the
lines of communication of the Japanese.

464
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,757
North Burma's like a great bowl
with mountains all the way round

465
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:48,517
and communications
running to the rim of the bowl.

466
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:53,276
We fanned out
to cut these lines of communication.

467
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:01,919
(narrator) The Chindits were
on their own, marooned in mid-Burma,

468
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,639
hundreds of miles from their base.

469
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:10,716
But now it wasn't hit and run.
This time they fought pitched battles.

470
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,993
(aircraft overhead)

471
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:46,714
Bombers were called in time and
time again to save a tricky situation.

472
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:53,800
Early on, the leader, Wingate,
was killed in an air crash.

473
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,195
The operation went on.

474
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:02,394
(man) We just marched
on our own two feet with muleteers.

475
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,672
If we was taken ill, we were just
sort of slung across the pony

476
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,672
till such time
as your temperature went down,

477
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,433
and after about two days
you was slung off the pony

478
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:16,638
and another unfortunate got put on.

479
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,996
(man #2) Any units
operating in those circumstances

480
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,036
have to be mobile all the time,

481
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:28,238
and wounded, of course,
immediately bring you to a halt.

482
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:32,916
Fortunately, Wingate was able to obtain
assistance from the United States

483
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,952
and we were given
some remarkable aircraft,

484
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:39,032
which was
a very short take-off/landing aircraft

485
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:44,792
and could get into any little valley
or bit of paddy field and so on,

486
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,235
and evacuate our wounded for us.

487
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,110
(narrator) Long weeks in the jungle -

488
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:56,832
weeks of dysentery, jaundice,
jungle sores and malaria.

489
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:02,836
Aircraft like this meant rescue
for thousands, sick as well as wounded.

490
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:10,193
The Chindits killed Japanese
where they thought they were safe,

491
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:15,195
and forced them
to divert troops from other purposes.

492
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:20,269
Fighting without respite in these
conditions told on the toughest.

493
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:24,239
(Calvert) Most of the brigades,
through casualties and disease -

494
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:28,871
they'd been behind the lines
for four to five months - were finished.

495
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:35,878
My own brigade had only 300 fit men
out of the 4,000 who originally came in.

496
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:48,992
(narrator) Meanwhile, pushing down
from the north were Merrill's Marauders.

497
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,278
Named after their leader,
Brigadier General Merrill,

498
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,915
the Marauders were American volunteers.

499
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:06,916
Among their targets,
the important airfield of Myitkyina.

500
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,198
But the Japanese again
had launched an offensive themselves.

501
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,068
In March 1944,
three divisions crossed the Chindwin

502
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:19,472
to attack Kohima and Imphal
inside India itself.

503
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,835
One division struck towards Kohima,

504
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,239
two towards Imphal.

505
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,833
They advanced rapidly,

506
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,753
threatening to isolate both objectives.

507
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:30,434
(man speaking Japanese)

508
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,154
(interpreter)
From the Chindwin river to Michan

509
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,430
there are many precipitous mountains

510
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,829
sticking out
like the fingers of the hand.

511
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:43,790
We advanced, climbing up and down
these steep mountains.

512
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:48,153
On the map, the distance
is only about 150 kilometres,

513
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,755
but when the mountains and valleys
were taken into consideration

514
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:55,037
it was about 300 km.

515
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:59,352
Without rest or sleep,
it took us 13 days to reach Michan,

516
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,000
where we cut the road.

517
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:07,075
(narrator) For the Japanese,
Kohima was a tempting prize.

518
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:12,154
Its capture would cut the Allies'
supply line to the great base at Imphal.

519
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:24,717
The British air crews flew dangerous
sorties to prevent their advance.

520
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:37,188
(bombs explode)

521
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,313
But the columns came on.

522
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:03,152
Steadily, the enemy
tightened their circle round Kohima.

523
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:08,400
They squeezed the small garrison
into a tiny central area.

524
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,917
Losses were heavy,
reinforcements desperately needed.

525
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:16,595
I sent the 2nd British Division
down to support

526
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:20,275
the fighting at Kohima,
and they went into Kohima.

527
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,828
The front line was on either side

528
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:26,515
of the district commissioner's
tennis court.

529
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,875
They stood shoulder to shoulder.

530
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,191
Where they were killed,
they were buried.

531
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:36,472
Out of three British infantry brigades,

532
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:41,634
two brigadiers killed, two brigadiers'
replacements seriously wounded.

533
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:44,393
That's what the fighting was like
in Kohima.

534
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,870
They attacked us at the tennis courts,

535
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:52,431
and it was just like playing tennis -

536
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:54,795
so much so that I believe that the area

537
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,519
from one side of a tennis court
to the other

538
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:02,515
was the positions between the Japanese
and the platoon I was with.

539
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:06,832
The fighting I saw was literally
hundreds at a time coming towards us.

540
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,952
The manpower strength
just pushed us back

541
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:13,755
from one trench
to a trench ten foot behind us.

542
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:17,799
Eventually they kept overrunning us
due to the manpower.

543
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:22,038
(narrator) Kohima was
the ordinary soldier's battle.

544
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:26,750
Small groups of Japanese and British
fought hand to hand.

545
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:33,628
(Brown) Every one of us was frightened.

546
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:39,033
If we put our hands up and surrendered,
our battalion would have been finished.

547
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:43,591
We knew that if the Japs had got us,
they would have shot us and tortured us,

548
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,797
Iike they did do to some of our boys.

549
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:50,839
So we stayed in the holes
and prayed to God.

550
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:53,878
After the first seven or eight days

551
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:57,509
the ammunition, the food,
was running out.

552
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:00,114
Water was almost non-existent.

553
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:04,830
Then we was told the 2nd All-British
was on their way to get us out.

554
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:15,472
(narrator) At last they got there.
The British were now struggling

555
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:19,030
to force the Japanese
back from the ridge they had seized,

556
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:22,635
and a continuous artillery duel went on.

557
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:31,991
The Japanese had started with a force
of 15,000 against a garrison of 3,500.

558
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,591
When the British supplies dwindled,

559
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:53,558
they were replenished
entirely from the air.

560
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,396
(man) I think everyone on the ground

561
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:03,792
felt just how much they owed
to these aircrews

562
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:07,873
who were going flat throughout the day
and sometimes during the night.

563
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:10,428
And at that time of the war

564
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:13,876
there weren't that number
of spare crews around,

565
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:19,478
so that each crew had its aircraft
and that aircraft had to be kept flying,

566
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:23,195
and they were going absolutely flat out.

567
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,515
(narrator) Kohima was relieved
after seven weeks.

568
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,950
The troops could now see
the suicidal price

569
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:39,669
the Japanese had paid
in their bid to capture it.

570
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,796
(man) They were fanatics.

571
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:44,633
When I say fanatics,
you could be holding a position

572
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:47,354
and they're about
30 yards away from you,

573
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:51,115
and all of a sudden they'd come
flying at you, shouting and yelling.

574
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,829
It always amazed us -
or amazed me, rather -

575
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:58,708
how anybody could come flying
out of the jungle expecting to kill you

576
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,791
who was shouting at you.

577
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:05,476
I know it unnerves you and all that,
but you can get used to this eventually.

578
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:09,917
And when we did get used to it,
we took a great toll of the Japanese.

579
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,675
We just held fire and got aim and said,
"You shout on, lad, you come on."

580
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:17,389
And they came on and
they filled up in front of our trenches,

581
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:20,517
our little weapon pits.

582
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:27,039
(man #2) Fighting the Japanese
was totally committed war.

583
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:32,274
There was no question of heroics,
mock-heroics or chivalry

584
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:38,071
in the sense that one read about
prior to the war with Biggles.

585
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:43,837
We were totally committed
to killing as many Japanese as possible,

586
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:48,038
probably prompted by the fact
that we knew from bitter experience

587
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:50,031
that there had been atrocities,

588
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:52,236
and we were always fearful of the fact

589
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:55,477
that we didn't wish
to be taken prisoner.

590
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:01,235
(Brown) I seen one of my lads
tied up with Dannert wire.

591
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:03,914
I don't want to see it no more.

592
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:10,512
It was impossible
to feel sorry or pitiful for'em,

593
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:14,195
because we knew what they done
to our boys.

594
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:22,111
They didn't give us a chance,
and we didn't give them a chance.

595
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:41,511
(narrator) After Kohima,
the relief of Imphal.

596
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:47,152
Fighting there had been as bloody
as at Kohima - and as heroic.

597
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:52,439
The Japanese now had to be cleared
from the Kohima-Imphal road.

598
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:02,394
In July 1944,
the Japanese broke off the offensive.

599
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:08,919
Kohima and Imphal had been
the high point of the Japanese effort.

600
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:13,869
"They will never come back,"
said General Slim.

601
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:27,954
On Stilwell's front,
the Chinese, with Merrill's Marauders,

602
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:30,355
had taken Myitkyina airfield -

603
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:33,432
but with heavy casualties.

604
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:37,957
Under monsoon skies,
more wounds to be dressed.

605
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:43,311
(thunder)

606
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:59,629
Mountbatten had said the troops
would fight through the monsoon.

607
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,312
Now, in the deluge,

608
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:04,949
they were driving the Japanese back
across the Burmese frontier.

609
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:08,715
Ahead, the long road
they had come two years before:

610
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:13,191
Mandalay, Rangoon,
and much bitter fighting.

611
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:16,596
There would be no rest

612
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:22,596
till all the Japanese in Burma
were defeated and destroyed.
