1
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,516
Hi, Pasquale.

2
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,320
What's going on?
Are you afraid the war will end?

3
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:59,348
Look at them, they're in a hurry! Morons!

4
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,277
> Good.
- What a bunch!

5
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,636
> Good!

6
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,796
You're good!

7
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,360
Listen, do you work here?

8
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,316
It would seem so.

9
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,913
- You're Roman, right?
- Why?

10
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:31,149
The Italian in the infantry,
the Roman in the orderly room.

11
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,440
I didn't choose this position.

12
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,920
"I obey without objecting to orders
and in the same way I die."

13
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,920
It doesn't matter.

14
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:47,080
There may be someone here who,
with all due respect,

15
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:52,837
in spite of his appearance, has health
problems and should not be enlisted.

16
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:58,320
A postponement,
of course without debt to me,

17
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,720
would be an act of benevolence.

18
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,080
What could I say? The skilled and enlisted
Roman, and the reformed Milanese.

19
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,834
- Ok, excuse me.
- Come here, wait.

20
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,640
I don't want you saying we are mean spirited.

21
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,160
- Have you told them you're sick?
- Yes.

22
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,880
This is what one must do.

23
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,800
If you weren't drafted before,
why do you come now?

24
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:28,080
I was in a "college" until a few days ago.
Do you understand?

25
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,871
But then came the amnesty.
This government is big-hearted!

26
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,076
30 liras.

27
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,276
20.

28
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,640
I help you, and you haggle?

29
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,080
It don't do it for the money,
but because I have pity in you.

30
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,116
Very well, 30 liras!

31
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,720
Ok, kid, answer me a question.

32
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,280
Have you understood I was
at the Orsoline "college"?

33
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,720
Perhaps I didn't express myself clearly.
First give, then you can have.

34
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,518
- First give, then have?
- Yes.

35
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,240
I make no promises.

36
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:19,800
My name is Busacca Giovanni,
of the N.N. '88 class, province of Milano.

37
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,030
- Get back in line.
- Do your best.

38
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,720
- What are you saying? Speak up.

39
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,400
- Can I close that window?
- That?

40
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:49,236
- Yes, the one near the tall guy.
Do you see it? - Yes.

41
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,680
Ssshh. Good.

42
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,514
- Well, what did he say?
- "He's on horseback".

43
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,553
Come on, run!

44
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,390
- Sergeant, what is he doing?
- Busacca, get back!

45
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,960
Gentlemen, pace!

46
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,356
Always last, lead-ass!

47
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,038
Platoon, halt!

48
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,189
Break lines! March!

49
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,040
Bloody hell, what kind of system is that!

50
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,800
- Roman, you're not that tough!
- I'm from the province of Catania.

51
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:03,318
Very well, from Parma and down all
are romans and camorrists.

52
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,680
- Cigarette?
- Drop the cigarettes, no smoking!

53
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,280
Attention, in two days we're leaving.

54
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,990
Tomorrow we'll have march training.
40 kilometres with a backpack.

55
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,395
Are you also carrying a backpack,
or do you have a dispensation from the pope?

56
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:34,960
We have never eaten together,
so don't address me as "you".

57
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,040
Gathering at 4 o'clock. Whoever comes late,
will have his hair cut off.

58
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,680
- Clear?
- Yes.

59
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,000
"Yes"! Sheep!

60
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,600
You're not even sheep,
you're objects, minerals.

61
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:53,400
Give me a match.
They cut your hair and you say: "Yes Sir"!

62
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,000
Tomorrow they will cut off an arm or a leg,
and you will say : "Yes Sir".

63
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,640
At the front even you can die.

64
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,880
A gun doesn't distinguish
the intelligent from the idiot.

65
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,640
You open your mouth and...
anyone may shoot you.

66
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,680
There is nothing to do.

67
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,240
You undeveloped soap-eaters
[southerners] are cheated

68
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,640
by your own renunciatory fatalism

69
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,280
A just war is a war of privileges.

70
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,748
Have you never read Bakunin?

71
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,440
On the first difficult name, you "report sick".

72
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,880
If you're so clever, why are you here?

73
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,880
Because of someone with the face of a fish.

74
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,040
If I find him, I'll break his back.

75
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:40,840
- Tomorrow you will break yours.
30 kilograms of backpack! - 30 kilos?

76
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,796
Try it.

77
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,196
But this is light!

78
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,394
It is filled with straw!

79
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,000
- If the sergeant realizes it, he will shave off your hair.
- He won't shave anyone!

80
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,640
Read Bakunin, and take
Busacca Giovanni's example.

81
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,960
Straws or newspapers,
nobody will realize anything.

82
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,349
The proverb says:

83
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,828
"If you can't understand anything
you're a lawyer or a sergeant".

84
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:19,257
"don't you remember in the month of April,
that long train on the way to the border.."

85
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,753
- Catania!
- We're on a train.

86
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,080
Where are you going? You're like a herring.

87
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,277
I have to go back home to my mom.

88
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,958
- Be careful! - Excuse me.
- How polite!

89
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,920
- And you, from where do you come?
- From many places.

90
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,840
In the precincts and the depots,
they have placed those unfit for walking.

91
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,956
There was a "reorder".

92
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:28,320
You don't by any chance
remember meeting an orderly

93
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,400
with a fish-face, potato-like eyes,

94
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,870
the appearance of a thief and shirker?
- Yes, him.

95
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,475
I don't need jokes.

96
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,040
- That's enough!
- Excuse me, I couldn't op...

97
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,996
Crap!

98
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,200
- Ah!
- Scoundrel, coward!

99
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,273
30 liras, huh? I'm going to kill you!

100
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,834
- Help!
- Get down!

101
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:18,280
- No!  - You are right, I could
break one of your arms or legs.

102
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,120
- Sure.
- And they would send you back home.

103
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,120
If I'm going to fight the war, so should you.

104
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,560
Everyone has to fight the war,
we all must follow the holy cause.

105
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,640
You followed the holy cause when
you were hiding in the district.

106
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,440
I  volunteered to come here.

107
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:42,080
Kid, your patriotic discourse
won't work on me.

108
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:47,240
- This is not my war. - No?
- No.

109
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,640
My war is against the
shirking sons of bitches.

110
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,400
They aren't just in Germany
or Austria, but everywhere.

111
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,000
and I have no desire to die for them.

112
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,200
Sure, this country needs
workers, not corpses.

113
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,240
I want to do great things for my country.

114
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:10,189
- What work do you do? - I'm a barber.
- Get lost will you!

115
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,156
What's going on?

116
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,960
- Be careful!
- What a stench!

117
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:38,909
In a short time you won't smell it anymore,
it will be covered by yours.

118
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,196
Silence!

119
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,231
Silence!

120
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,397
Who is the oldest of you?

121
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,120
Me. Soldier Iacovacci Oreste.

122
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:06,398
- You'll be day corporal.
- Yes Sir.

123
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,200
At-tention!

124
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,640
In ten minutes I want you all at your places.

125
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:23,189
- With shiny shoes and your
backpacks in order!

126
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,520
- Who said that?
- I did!

127
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,149
Stop it! That's enough! Silence!

128
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:37,120
- Iacovacci, you're the oldest,
but also the biggest twat! - Sergeant...

129
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,320
- I revoke your order!
- I lack the education. - Silence!

130
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:47,589
- The prisoners are coming.
- Have we taken prisoners already?

131
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,312
Where are they? Let me see.

132
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,560
How ugly they look!

133
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,640
Ugly slobs, we got you! Good!

134
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:05,320
What are you saying?
They're our own returning from the front.

135
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,788
- Our own?
- Damn!

136
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,720
If they're from the front,
why do they come here?

137
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,360
- To be deloused.
- They are coming to be complemented.

138
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,113
And then they return to the front.

139
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,676
Fortunately. No?

140
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,955
But what are these complements?

141
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,673
We are. Idiot.

142
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,676
We?

143
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,398
- How nice!
- I'll have a good rest!

144
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,876
I'm going there.

145
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,556
Beautiful! Francesca Bertini, right?
I like it.

146
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,719
You're not allowed appreciations.

147
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,920
You showed them hell, right?

148
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,720
You made them understand
who we Italians are!

149
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,000
What a draft! I'll have a pneumonia.

150
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,400
- Want to change places?
- Never mind, thanks.

151
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:25,791
- It's no trouble at all,
give me 2 francs. - All right.

152
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,520
- My name is Bordin.
- Deconcini. Thank you.

153
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:33,360
- That's nothing. What are you doing?
- There is nothing in the backpack.

154
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,399
You showed them hell!
Made them understand who we Italians are!

155
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,399
- At-tention!
- At-tention!

156
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,956
At ease.

157
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:53,440
The newly arrived battalion,
made up from brave soldiers,

158
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,160
courageously supported by abnegations

159
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,799
sacrifices and deprivations...

160
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,280
That battalion is now merged with our.

161
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:10,193
- The commander will be lieutenant Gallina [Hen].

162
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,076
Who said that?

163
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,040
Youngsters, my name has been Gallina for 37 years.

164
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,080
It was always made fun of.

165
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:30,240
"an old hen makes a good broth",

166
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,920
"better eggs today than hen tomorrow",
and many other.

167
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:39,471
After a while this nonsense didn't
make anyone laugh anymore.

168
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:45,837
Likewise, your desire to laugh will soon end.

169
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,838
- At-tention!
- At ease.

170
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,080
- Lieutenant..
- Aaaahh!

171
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,240
- Lieutenant.
- Giacomazzi, I don't have time.

172
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:09,640
Teresa wrote to me 5 days ago,
I have to answer her.

173
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:13,040
Have someone else write your letters.

174
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:18,560
We are two, the parish priest of the village
writes for Theresa, which makes four in all.

175
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:23,040
I don't want other people involved,
these are intimate matters.

176
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:26,112
- Sure, excuse me.
- No reason to.

177
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,990
- Ok, come to the orderly room later.
- Thank you.

178
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:45,440
I may be mistaken, but I believe
Nicotra Rosario is preparing

179
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,113
to betray Francesca Bertini.

180
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:54,679
The affection for an artist is one thing,
the masculine needs quite another.

181
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,837
"Inside the trousers is immediate absolution".

182
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,990
Give me a mirror.

183
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:10,079
- Did you give me a high or low cut? - Look.

184
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,720
Both of them, high and low.

185
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:18,680
Are you certain you're a barber?

186
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:25,040
It's really a "boy-cut!"
I'm practicing it on this big head.

187
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,996
See it?

188
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,710
You've been serviced.

189
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,160
- So?
- How much did we agree on?

190
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,754
- Two "planks".
- Two planks?

191
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,548
- I'll shave you tomorrow.
- Alright.

192
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,198
Boys.

193
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,556
Quiet, boys.

194
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,040
It is useless dressing up, lieutenant Loquenzi

195
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:07,080
has revoked everyone's leave.

196
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:11,280
You can blame the idiot who made the "cackle".

197
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:16,000
But only one did that,
not all the comrades.

198
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,276
It's not my order, it comes from lieutenant Loquenzi.

199
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,869
Bye, stinkers.

200
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:49,520
Write that I kiss her,
and that my life is depressing

201
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,520
also in the evening, which is
the saddest time of day. Period.

202
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:57,480
And that I embrace her.
Did you write the period?

203
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,120
Don't worry, Giacomazzi.

204
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:04,120
I am tired of writing amorous phrases to a priest!

205
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:13,633
The guard change signal.
Here?

206
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,635
- Present. - And the others?
- They all took absence without leave.

207
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,195
Always at your command, Mr. lieutenant.

208
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:38,560
- At ease.
- Did he go to report it?

209
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:43,440
You're holding grudges towards
them, it is unforgivable.

210
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,520
Punishing the men who came
in from the trenches!

211
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,800
They haven't seen a woman in months!

212
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,800
- You should have left them to me.
- But Mr. lieutenant....

213
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:58,680
You have forced them to be
disobediant to an officer.

214
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,480
Now it is necessary to give them
a punishment that will seem unfair

215
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,076
because it has been provoked from your
bad mood and from your incapability.

216
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,600
If you believe so, I...

217
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,518
Please leave.

218
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,717
What a horrible town, there are only military here!

219
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,517
Excuse me, where can I find a woman?

220
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,156
Excuse me, father.

221
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:57,160
Try after the fountain, third gate to the left.

222
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:02,280
- I have seen some activity there.
- Thank you, chaplain.

223
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,557
Don't push!

224
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,110
What do you want? Go away!

225
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,993
- How nice!
- Go away!

226
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:30,071
Go away! I'm not coming!

227
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:35,798
- Giovanni, look a little for me as well.
- Come, dwarf!

228
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,996
Take this!

229
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,154
Did that make you angry, or what?

230
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,391
Not bad!

231
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,640
An officer from the assult division is coming.

232
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,160
Pick up your cigarette butts, rubbish, everything. Quick!

233
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,400
The quarters must shine like a dance hall!

234
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,872
If everything is in order, the lieutenant
will suspend the punishment.

235
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,280
- What are you doing?
- It's an egg.

236
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:17,480
- Find brooms, quick!
- Where are the brooms?

237
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:22,520
At the regiment depot.
Fast!

238
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,476
Quick!

239
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,320
You have to give me a ticket of
withdrawal from "round stamp".

240
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,160
- For two brooms?
- Even for a button.

241
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:38,400
- Don't you know captain Castelli.
- Who is he?

242
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,949
He is called "Round Stamp",
he's at the regimental office.

243
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,680
- Don't touch those shoes!
- Relax will you.

244
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,035
Put the shoes down!

245
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:54,038
Bah!

246
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,035
Let's go.

247
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,400
- We aren't thieves.
- Get out!

248
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,868
Move it. Come on!

249
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,360
This has become the "Complaints Office"!

250
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:18,760
You need a permission with the
stamp of the undersigned.

251
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,680
Without a permission,

252
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:24,960
you won't be able to "practise" here or in any
war zone anymore. Do you understand?

253
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:30,880
I have understood, but I didn't
come here to fight all these battles!

254
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,192
- I can't do a thing about it, and I don't like that!
- What don't you like?

255
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:43,400
- Do you always enjoy being a captain?
- I won't talk about that.

256
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,960
Among the soldiers there are many
scoundrels, and dirty ones too.

257
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,713
- Listen!

258
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,160
You want me to select them for you?

259
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:58,560
Only clean soldiers, beautiful,
blonde, educated at Oxford.

260
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:02,200
No, but even I have my preferences.

261
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,512
I don't like being treated badly.
Do you understand?

262
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:13,714
- Do you know what I'll do? I resign my job.
- As you wish.

263
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:19,953
- Give me some, Costantina!
- I'm not on duty.

264
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,356
Scoundrels!

265
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,756
What do you want?

266
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,920
- I'll talk, I'm the oldest.
- Speak.

267
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,639
A ticket for the withdrawal of two brooms.

268
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,673
- Do you have old ones to hand in?
- No.

269
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,440
Battalion, company and reason.

270
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:54,880
First company, third battalion.
And the reason?

271
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,200
- For sweeping.
- For sweeping.

272
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,000
The commander of the assault division is coming.

273
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,276
I wish the assault division could come here.

274
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:07,272
Where is the round stamp?

275
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,560
You are fed up with the war, right?

276
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:30,520
Like you, I wish I could go back home.

277
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,040
But if we went home, do you
know what would happen?

278
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:37,600
- You're coming now?
- We have brought the brooms. - Silence!

279
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,920
In the next march, you will
carry the machine gun.

280
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:44,400
We would have austrians, bosnians
and hungarians in our kitchens!

281
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,520
You! Do you have a family? Mother, sisters?

282
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,240
Yes. I have a mother and a little sister.

283
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,080
Tell your friends what the
austrians would do to them.

284
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:58,400
We have to give those scoundrels a lesson.

285
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:03,872
We must clench our teeth,
and fight with endurance!

286
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:09,360
I'm here to recruit volunteers
for the assault battalions.

287
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:16,040
We want volunteers who'll throw their
hearts at the enemy's trenches.

288
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:23,230
I want ten men, every battalion
will give the best they have.

289
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:28,720
- I'm finished.
- Me -Me -Me -Me.

290
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,720
Thank you. I'll wait for you tonight,
after returning to the regiment headquarters.

291
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,278
At-tention!

292
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:29,440
- Lady, can I help you?
- What are you doing?

293
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:36,400
I don't mean to annoy you.
I'm not making a pass at you.

294
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:41,600
A lady like you shouldn't
walk around on these roads.

295
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,751
- Excuse me, I was at your right side.
- What do you want?

296
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:53,240
I confess, I don't mean chivalry only,
I also would like to speak to you.

297
00:29:53,240 --> 00:30:00,800
In my division it is difficult to
meet a fine person like you,

298
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:04,760
who doesn't have a face
that hurts to look at.

299
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:09,480
What do you do? Don't answer, I'll guess.
You're a teacher.

300
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:13,720
An elementary school teacher who
stayed behind continue her work.

301
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:17,840
Or maybe you're Miss lrma,
the colonel's daughter?

302
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,833
- Me?
- Good, fortunately!

303
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,840
- What are you doing? - Opening.
- Leave that to me.

304
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,197
I'll open it, you have
the most delicate fingers!

305
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,992
Please.

306
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:38,480
This is the cruel reality of war;

307
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:44,200
It gives a man the urge to
exchange thoughts, feelings,

308
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:48,080
music, poetry, dance... Flowers?

309
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,080
- No, artichoke thistle.
- Do you cook? - Yes.

310
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,231
Very good! Is this your place?

311
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:02,120
Goodness! What a nice room.

312
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:06,560
It is attractive, cheerful. My compliments.

313
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:10,440
- Uuhh, I must move it!
- Wait, I'll help.

314
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,440
- I'll make myself useful. Damn!
- What are you doing?

315
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,320
Excuse me, a bad word escaped me...

316
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:20,517
- No, here.
- Yes.

317
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,908
I am a little clumsy,
but I always do my best.

318
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,313
A little cool water and it's alright.

319
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,640
A woman's fingers!

320
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,880
You don't get burned,
you're like a salamander!

321
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,840
- Do you want a boiled potato?
- With pleasure.

322
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:44,436
- Let's light some candles.
- Here come the matches!

323
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:58,271
There, a little atmosphere.

324
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:09,200
- Here are the potatoes. I like them a lot.
- Me too.

325
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,440
- Can I help you?
- No thanks, I've finished.

326
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,638
No, I can't allow it.

327
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:22,352
Be seated, it seems we don't miss anything.

328
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,956
Ah, the salt.

329
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:32,270
- It is cooking salt.
- Then I'll crush it. We refine it.

330
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:39,600
- You trying to tease me with all
that chit-chat, right? - Me?

331
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,640
Why?

332
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:47,160
You must believe me, after I became a soldier,

333
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:52,154
this is the first time that my...feelings

334
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,920
are this noble.

335
00:32:54,920 --> 00:33:00,920
- Dear... What is your name?
- Costantina. - Beautiful name.

336
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:04,360
- Very good. Salt?
- Yes. -Thanks.

337
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,316
Appreciated.

338
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:12,555
What small fingers, like two farfalline.

339
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,116
Delicious.

340
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:21,200
- You had a civil employment?
- Well...

341
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,519
And if that was the case?

342
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,520
Costantina, I want to tell you something.

343
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:33,230
When I'm with you, I feel like any man.

344
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,276
- Pardon.
- You are welcome.

345
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,477
- What do you want?
- What do you mean "what I want"? - Get lost!

346
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:53,159
- My Red Cross nurse friend.
- I understand.

347
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:58,640
- The retreat signal.
- It doesn't matter, I have leave.

348
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,596
Then...

349
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:07,753
- But I haven't given you permission.
- It's just something you say. Come on!

350
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:13,269
Yes Sir. Certainly, understood.

351
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:34,638
- Advance departure.
- Where to, Major?

352
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,156
Pontevarco.

353
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:41,438
- Give me a cigarette, please.
- Yes Sir.

354
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,560
Thank you.

355
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,516
Tomorrow morning.

356
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,680
Tonight we will have to work until late.

357
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:57,360
- A nice surprise.
- There is something even nicer.

358
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,880
- No artillery.
- It is too much luxury.

359
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,350
And then we can't even serve
them, it's the infantry.

360
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,160
This stove! When it shouldn't boil, it boils

361
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:21,640
- and when it should boil, it doesn't.
- Unforgettable moments!

362
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:26,400
In a week we leave for the trenches.

363
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,680
- No, the departure is tomorrow.
- What?

364
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:34,080
- But aren't you of the seventh?
- Yes - Then you depart tomorrow.

365
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:38,676
In three days the Bersagliere corps,
and in one week the 16th.

366
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,280
Tomorrow? They are crazy!

367
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,200
Without any warning!

368
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:53,196
- How come you never became an officer?
- That is a long story.

369
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:57,080
I didn't want to take the course,
for democratic reasons.

370
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,440
For personal reasons.

371
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,115
I am a man of thoughts, not of action.

372
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:08,040
- Have you read Bakunin?
- No, I don't read novels.

373
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:13,840
- Mother said they aren't serious.
- Perhaps she is right.

374
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:19,280
How come you know about all the departures?

375
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,000
From the captains of the assault departments.
We are friends.

376
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,760
- That is, they are friends of my father
- What captain?

377
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,840
Ah, I see, the one with the black hat.

378
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:32,040
He wears it to cover a scar.
Poor man.

379
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,560
Poor man? You're crazy.

380
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:41,880
Every day he attacks.
That's enough cleaning of the jacket, thanks.

381
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:46,280
He doesn't attack every day.
Now he's going to Mantova

382
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:49,920
- to instruct the volunteers.
- to Mantova?

383
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:55,597
Yes, for two or three months.
Perhaps the war is over by then.

384
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,400
In two or three months, it can happen.

385
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,760
Lazy, cowardly Roman pig!

386
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:06,920
- Who?
- Iacovacci Oreste.

387
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,760
If I get to him, I'll break his knees.

388
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,672
I have to leave, goodbye.

389
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:18,595
Excuse me, Costantina,
I'm acting like a brute.

390
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:23,760
Goodbye. Coward, I'll kill you!

391
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,433
Hurry back, you'll see!

392
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,200
- Aye! - Excuse me , where is captain Ferri,
the one with the volunteers?

393
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:41,160
- You're coming at this hour?
- I have a signed permission from Gallina.

394
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,116
Let me see it.

395
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,320
Damn, my wallet!

396
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:55,520
Costantina! That is why
she was all over my jacket!

397
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:00,280
- Don't mock me.
- You're quite a type!

398
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,200
You've made to violations:
You're returing without your permission to leave

399
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,800
and continue speaking to me
in the informal manner.

400
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:10,000
During the march, you will
carry the machine gun!

401
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,120
Ok?

402
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:18,160
Listen, sergeant, you will have to find
another one to carry the machine gun

403
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:22,720
because soldier Busacca Giovanni
is going to Mantova tomorrow.

404
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,597
At your service!

405
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,470
- You, where are you going?
- Leave me alone!

406
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:40,440
- It can't be!
- I haven't said you could enter. What do you want?

407
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,800
- Enlist me.
- By now the list is complete.

408
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:48,080
I cannot cancel other soldiers.
There is only one place left.

409
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,360
- Take me.
- I arrived first.

410
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:56,080
Captain, before you choose, look well.

411
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,960
Physics are important.

412
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:05,040
- Height 1 meter and 89, chest 98.
- My feet are size 45.

413
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:09,560
- What has feet got to do with it?
- I can't give you phenomenal physics.

414
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:13,360
I can give you steady nerves,
love of my country and fearlessness.

415
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:16,840
These things are not measured with a yardstick.

416
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:20,480
If we are to compare love of
the fatherland and fearlessness,

417
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,080
- No one can compete with me.
Do you understand? - But...

418
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,036
- Enough!
- Yes sir.

419
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:39,714
In a few seconds this bomb will explode.

420
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,918
Let's see who is the more fearless of you.

421
00:40:07,499 --> 00:40:18,426
.

422
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,758
< Keep up, slackers!

423
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:54,517
Damn! I could have been in Mantova by now.

424
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,920
Instead you arrive and
start acting all patriotic.

425
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,560
- Have you ever seen a true patriot?
- Stop it will you!

426
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:07,520
You're a true Pietro Micca [war hero],
but the captain didn't get it.

427
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:13,360
- The captain did get it!
- Bordin! - You are the lieutenant.

428
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,994
My God, what is that?

429
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:25,233
You've never felt them before?
That must have been at least a 210.

430
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:30,156
- Do they ever fall close by?
- That is what they aim for!

431
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,796
Halt!

432
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,199
Rest! company, rest.
Backpacks off!

433
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,435
Backpack on the ground.

434
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:59,880
If anyone takes off his shoes,
I'm going to hit him with the machine gun.

435
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:03,600
I won't allow it, Francesca Bertini is a chaste artist!

436
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:07,760
Do you remember "The tide of voluptuousness "?

437
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,960
She had a husband and two lovers!

438
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:14,760
And do you remember "Gipsy blood"?
She sacrifices herself becomes a nun.

439
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,000
Yes, in films, but not in real life.

440
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,520
So when she becomes a nun it is not true,
but when she has two lovers it is?

441
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,280
- Who are you?
- Fresh troops!

442
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,880
< The general!
- The general!

443
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,792
Who is your commander?

444
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:36,040
- Lieutenant Gallina at your service.
- There is a sentence to be carried out.

445
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,952
Make yourself available to captain Marchi.

446
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:46,560
- I knew it!
- What's happening?

447
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:50,360
- An Austrian spy.
- A spy? Ah, look over there!

448
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,680
Have you seen the blond guy?

449
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:56,639
- Bordin!
- I knew it! - Ginetto. Strucchi.

450
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:01,671
Mandi. Sallusti. Pernice. Cerioni.

451
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,076
Arborio.

452
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,720
March off with the company,
I have to command an execution.

453
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,120
- On your feet, company!
- You, come with me.

454
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,031
Company, march forward!

455
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,756
At-tention!

456
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,076
Ready!

457
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,796
Load!

458
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,916
Aim!

459
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,156
Fire!

460
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:31,435
We arrived in time. Two more minutes
and we would have been finished.

461
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,680
A hand!

462
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,636
Whose is it?

463
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:43,916
Where are we?

464
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:50,916
You'll grow accustomed to it.

465
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,316
Let's leave here.

466
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,357
But she pretended not to see me.
She always avoided me.

467
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:09,240
Then, on the day I left for the army,

468
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:12,280
I found her at the station, in front of the trains.

469
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:15,716
She gave me an envelope, and then ran away.

470
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:20,349
- In it was her photograph.
- Let's see it!

471
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,390
Ah! She looks nice!

472
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:37,200
Boys, two men must go with lieutenant Loquenzi

473
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,909
to put mines under the fences. Volunteers?

474
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:47,993
You and you, down there!

475
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:52,869
- Hey!
- Why me?

476
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,360
In civil life, Decuccini used
to manufacture fireworks,

477
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:02,760
so he must have a certain
familiarity with explosives.

478
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:07,560
I only understand the work of
an electrician, I am not suited.

479
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:12,480
At times the fences are electrified.
You're well suited.

480
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,916
No backpack and no rifle!

481
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:19,112
Of course he had to choose me!

482
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:23,080
I understand that he was chosen,
but what have I got to do with it?

483
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,036
Who has a matchstick?

484
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:34,757
- I'll take your place.
- What do you mean?

485
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,710
For 10 liras.

486
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:41,680
He's playing with me, right?

487
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:47,232
No, it's the standard rate.
I wouldn't go for a 100 liras!

488
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:50,036
In cash!

489
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:56,960
Okay! Roman, give Bordin 10 liras.

490
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:01,600
- Why me?
- You stole 30 liras from me!

491
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,273
You never seem to remember that!
Come on, pay him!

492
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,476
Take it out!

493
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:13,438
- What is that?
- The safe!

494
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:16,400
- You're carrying it in a "Valda" box?
- Always!

495
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:22,200
- And if they hit you?
- I will... caress it!

496
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:25,397
< The other one, quick!
- Coming at once!

497
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,160
- Hello, father.
- Hi, Bordin.

498
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:33,674
Will you give me some of that holy oil?

499
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:44,909
Thank you... it will be empty when I come back.

500
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:49,560
- Bordin, this time also?
- It so happened.

501
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:53,840
- Why are you being such an idiot?
- I have 5 kids, I must do as best I can for them.

502
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:57,800
- Do less!
- It's the army's fault!

503
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:02,200
When I'm in bed with my wife
during leave or during rests,

504
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,236
I don't understand anything.

505
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:35,559
- Stay here, I'm going ahead.
- Ok, lieutenant.

506
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:42,149
Don't be afraid, we'll get out alive.

507
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:45,036
Come quickly.

508
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,920
Give it to me. Pass it over.

509
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:05,836
Even.

510
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:12,190
Hold it. Turn it on quickly and get away!

511
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,198
When they see the flame, they will shoot.

512
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:44,751
Come! My God, he's become entangled!

513
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,756
Where are you going? It's too late now.

514
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,956
They are looking for him.

515
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:09,240
- Poor boy.
- We can't stay here.

516
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,834
- Let's get out.
- You first, lieutenant.

517
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:31,072
- Jump!
- The sniper still has two shots, and he has aimed.

518
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:45,400
In this game, the first one
out is the more fortunate,

519
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:48,358
the second, unless he is clever like him, dies.

520
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:53,280
Thank you, but I don't need mercy.
Give me a cigarette.

521
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:57,876
Yes, I have sent out four groups,
the passages through the fences are open.

522
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:03,200
- Wait for what?
- The reports from the other battalions.

523
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:07,840
The austrians will see the passages,
and they will position their machine guns.

524
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:10,560
Shall I send my men to the
slaughterhouse without artillery?

525
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:15,040
Enough, major.
We also hoped there would be artillery,

526
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:18,320
but there isn't, nontheless it is necessary
to take the bridge, that's what we're here for.

527
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:21,278
<i>We are here... excuse me.</i>

528
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:25,480
I couldn't hear your last words, the line is bad.

529
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:27,436
Wait for the attack order.

530
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:32,200
I don't know if I am crazy or if they are.

531
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:35,600
If we win this war with what we have,

532
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:38,353
we are truly a great army.

533
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:44,199
What do they expect?

534
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:48,800
That fanatical jew wants to massacre our force.

535
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:53,600
Speak when the hens piss!

536
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:57,639
Lieutenant, have two men reactivate
the line with headquarters.

537
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,040
- I'm an electrician!
- Me too!

538
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:06,520
It is hard work, I have lost three men in half an hour!

539
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:09,080
Get moving you two!

540
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:14,156
Shall we go?

541
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:18,271
Come! Move it!

542
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,715
The sun will rise in a short while!

543
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:37,920
Let's go , remove the sandbags!
The other battalions will follow.

544
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,360
And my loophole too!

545
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:42,271
Remove the sandbags!

546
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:49,520
- The seventh has attacked.
- Who gave the order? - I don't know.

547
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,715
- Phone colonel Palazzi.
- Yes.

548
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:53,711
Forward!

549
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,556
Move forward!

550
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:54,476
Here, quick!

551
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,676
Here!

552
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:00,556
Forward, boys!

553
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:29,155
Towards the next trench!

554
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:52,274
Where are we going?
To get killed, the way they are shooting!

555
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,356
Get down!

556
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:02,513
- They are crazy!
- Stay here with the contact!

557
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,436
The clamps!

558
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,516
Where are they attacking?

559
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:34,678
Hello?

560
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:38,232
- Hello?

561
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:41,360
What did you say? I didn't understand!

562
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:48,720
What are you doing?
There is a German here!

563
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:51,757
- Where did you connect it, moron!
- I made a mistake.

564
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:54,676
Retry!

565
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:59,118
Hello?

566
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:02,433
Hello? Hello?

567
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:09,440
- Hello?
- Finally!  Let me speak to major Segre.

568
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:12,400
He's not here at the moment.

569
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:15,400
Imbecile! Give me the major at once!

570
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:19,320
- What is your name?
- Soldier Iacovacci Oreste.

571
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:21,117
Listen good...

572
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:27,960
- No doubt, general.
- What did he say?

573
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:32,397
If I don't get him the major in 3 minutes,
you'll be put on trial.

574
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:02,480
Mother! The end of the world!
Everyone is being slaughtered!

575
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:06,632
Where is major Segre?
The general wants to speak...

576
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,680
He gave my name!

577
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:14,468
- Lieutenant, the general.... - Move away!

578
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,876
What is it?

579
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,680
The general wants to speak
at once with major Segre.

580
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:42,877
The general, the major...

581
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,760
Lieutenant Gallina, seventh battalion.

582
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:52,070
Yes, general..
No, general..

583
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:55,708
The major is dead, general.

584
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:57,680
Yes.

585
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:59,636
The bridge?

586
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:05,075
We have conquered it...
completely destroyed.

587
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:16,910
See? There we are.

588
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:21,160
We're inside a small house,
everyone's happy.

589
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:22,840
Listen to this.

590
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:26,800
"Our soldiers gather around the
heating stoves in the camps,

591
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:31,080
where they entertain themselves with
music and singing, in the long waiting hours

592
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:36,598
in this period of stagnant operations."

593
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:41,440
They're sorry it's a stagnant period!

594
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:45,880
People think war is hard only
when you're being fired upon,

595
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:50,120
they don't know how hard it is to stay
firm sitting on the wet ground,

596
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:52,800
waiting for the ration that never arrives.

597
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:54,756
Let me in!

598
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:02,118
War is just a long wait without a minute of rest.

599
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,280
- What time is it?
- Bah!

600
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:08,880
The last time we had a hot meal was Thursday.

601
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:12,509
They should write these things!

602
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:15,960
We are here, those who write are at home.

603
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:20,680
They can stay at home,
but they don't have to write lies.

604
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:25,280
I'm not speaking for myself, but for
the poor people who can read!

605
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:29,000
"It is better to live one day a drunkard,
than one hundred a lion."

606
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,800
- Giovanni, will you give me that cigarette?
- Yes.

607
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:37,840
If only the dead could speak of
the war... but they keep quiet!

608
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:42,600
We can't know if they've been in the war or not.

609
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:45,000
Shut up, Africa.

610
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:50,760
For centuries people have been butchered
by wars, but never served properly.

611
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:55,160
No one has the right to order
a man to go to his death.

612
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:57,960
If not, why have they
abolished the death sentence?

613
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:01,200
For you it would be better if
all penalties were abolished!

614
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:05,120
To show them how we
spend this stagnant period,

615
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:08,192
I would send them this louse
in a registered letter!

616
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,676
< The ration!

617
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:28,879
Line up! Don't push!

618
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:33,920
- You must wait!
< Has the general tasted it?

619
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:39,472
Enough! The general will make an
unannounced inspection!

620
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:45,120
Instead of speaking now,
protest when he arrives!

621
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:50,840
- No more beating the spoons.
- Were you in prison too?

622
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:55,520
One must speak for all, perhaps
the oldest one. Bordin Giuseppe!

623
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:59,080
This calls for sedition.

624
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:02,080
Do what you want,
I haven't seen anything.

625
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:05,280
Sergeant, excuse me that my
ignorance is not on your level,

626
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:08,560
but "seduction" has nothing to do with it.

627
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:13,120
Here's a fighter who will tell the general

628
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:16,040
that this crap food is no good.

629
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:20,431
We'll decide by counting who
will protest to the general.

630
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:23,840
Count properly, I know you!

631
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:27,515
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12!
You will do it!

632
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:29,996
I will?

633
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:34,157
So?

634
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:39,160
- What shall I say?
- If he speaks, everyone will be shot!

635
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:41,840
- True, you will do it.
- Me?

636
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:46,909
Quiet, boys! The general!

637
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:51,039
At-tention!

638
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:57,840
- At ease. This is an informal, friendly visit.
- At ease.

639
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:00,720
- Distribute the ration.
- Yes, general.

640
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:03,757
I believe our young fellows are hungry.

641
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:22,634
- Taste your ration and tell me what you think.
- Yes Sir.

642
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:27,480
Optimal and abundant!

643
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:30,320
Quite the contrary, it is disgusting!
No fat and little pasta!

644
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:33,710
This is not food for fighting men,
improve it!

645
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,956
Coward!

646
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:44,834
I said what I meant!
Taste it and tell me it is good...!

647
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:59,480
I know that the ration
can't be better than that,

648
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:03,040
but it is necessary to give
the boys a little satisfaction.

649
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:05,395
They are satisfied with very little!

650
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,919
It is not bullion, it is minestrone.

651
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:42,280
It is special stuff! Who cares about butter and bacon!

652
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:44,400
And oil and onions!

653
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:47,120
It is a minestrone of the earth!

654
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:50,200
Sure, the regiment cook is Pellegrino Artusi!

655
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:52,640
Guys, a hen!

656
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:55,200
Where? Where?

657
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:07,554
- It's fat!
- It's eating our minestrone.

658
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:15,640
Even the hen refuses to eat it!
Imagine what we are eating!

659
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:17,760
We must make it come over here!

660
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:22,712
- Who is it?
- Bravo, continue!

661
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:25,713
Do we start all over again, guys?

662
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:30,440
Come, lieutenant.
There is a fat hen over there!

663
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:32,351
Lieutenant, a hen.

664
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:40,511
Dirty slob, come to daddy.
See where it leads you!

665
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:49,320
- It stopped.
- If the austrians spot it, we're out of luck.

666
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:51,800
It wants breadcrumbs.

667
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:56,200
Sure! Wish I had some bread!

668
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:58,840
- Oreste, throw it out.
- What?

669
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:01,434
- Throw out some bread.
- I don't have any!

670
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:08,840
It's my bread!
It's the reserve of the reserve, lieutenant.

671
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:11,115
I'll have a chicken leg for that!

672
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:14,680
- Too short.
- Hey, that bread is mine!

673
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:17,990
- But the hen belongs to everyone!
- Is that an ostrich out there?

674
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:29,679
The austrians!
It's walking towards the enemy!

675
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:38,713
- Sure, it heard a male voice!
- It is a whore hen.

676
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:43,353
- No, wait, perhaps...
- If we're not eating it, nor will they.

677
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:52,151
What are they saying?

678
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:56,640
They're saying the chicken was theirs,
we already have one.

679
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:58,596
- Do you understand German?
- No.

680
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:02,720
Enough, back to your positions!
Take your positions!

681
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:05,917
In the meantime you
can replace my loaf!

682
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:18,678
Mail has arrived!

683
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:46,316
Iacovacci Oreste!

684
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:49,796
A jump for the old man!

685
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,355
Iacomacci Ernani.

686
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:55,831
A jump for the old man.

687
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:58,600
- Iacovacci Oreste!
- Here.

688
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:03,315
- A jump for the old man.
- Again!

689
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:07,597
- Pascucci Mauro!
> Here I am!

690
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:09,920
How many letters did you get?

691
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:13,520
- Who's writing to you?
- It's the godmothers of war.

692
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:18,160
I write a letter, I make a copy...
and then comes the surprise.

693
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:20,080
You read this letter.

694
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:23,120
- Nobody writes you any?
- Give me a match.

695
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:25,076
Who'd want to write me?

696
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:29,153
> Busacca Giovanni!
- For me?

697
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:41,080
Did someone remember you
for Christmas after all?

698
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:44,709
- Make a nice jump for the old man.
- Yes, a nice jump!

699
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:49,751
It is a citazion from court,
I have a new hearing! Damn it!

700
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:54,600
- They have passed my son for service!
- Your son has been drafted?

701
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:58,320
I "made" him in '96, therefore
he has been drafted.

702
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:02,160
The rich also have the
fortune to be in bad shape.

703
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:04,200
- For me nothing?
- Negus,

704
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:08,360
letters from your country will
arrive only with camels troops.

705
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:12,960
"What a Peperoni"! You polenta-eaters
always say the same things.

706
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:16,280
- Who can write to you?
- Personal relationships.

707
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:20,080
- Francesca Bertini!
- Yes, Francesca Bertini.

708
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:23,360
I wrote her asking for one
of the photos from L'Elica.

709
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:25,316
Yes, with the helmet!

710
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:29,320
- I have found chestnuts.
- Let's roast chestnuts!

711
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:33,880
- We need a frying pan with holes in it!
- I'll find the frying pan.

712
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:38,032
Now, let's do it as it should be done.
There I can make the holes.

713
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:44,479
Filthy snipers! Hit this if you can!

714
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:56,869
It's done! Let's roast some chestnuts!

715
01:09:57,640 --> 01:09:59,596
Want some?

716
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:08,474
Over there.

717
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:14,356
Messenger.

718
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:19,276
What are you doing?

719
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:27,720
Wait! Let them finish the magazine!

720
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:30,720
- I have a written order!
- Don't move!

721
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:33,840
- Wait until dark.
- Bordin, I'm giving the orders.

722
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:36,720
Perhaps he has an important message.

723
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:39,996
- Do you have a sealed envelope?
- Yes.

724
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:44,120
- Jump, quick!
- Wait! - What are you doing?

725
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:47,440
Excuse me, Lieutenant.

726
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:51,280
Perhaps because I have a child like him...
it is not for lack...

727
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:54,636
Quiet Bordin, or you'll get a reprimand.

728
01:10:57,480 --> 01:10:59,436
Jump, quick!

729
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:08,119
Damn! Take him to the infirmary at once!

730
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:13,396
- For lieutenant Gallina.
- Yes Sir.

731
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:26,440
Lieutenant, a message.

732
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:38,960
The Headquarter wishes Merry Christmas

733
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:43,317
and orders the distribution of chocolate
and grappa. You, move it!

734
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:25,633
Boys, grappa for those who want!

735
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:43,713
Pay more attention the next time.

736
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:01,120
We'll split up now.

737
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:04,360
You two stay in this area,
Giacomazzi and I go there.

738
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:07,636
Be attentive, in 15 minutes
we'll meet again here.

739
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:19,833
- Don't wander off too far!
- Trust us, sergeant.

740
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:28,118
- So that's how you do it?
- If you want to, you can go for a round.

741
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:35,030
Better to remain compact.

742
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:50,030
- A game of cards?
- No.

743
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:55,309
That cloud resembles a naked woman.

744
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:57,720
Where?

745
01:13:57,720 --> 01:14:00,393
Look, that is the head

746
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:03,116
and those are the breasts.

747
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:06,790
She also has a beard.

748
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:17,918
- Listen to the bird.
- It is a blackbird.

749
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:25,631
In this region, the blackbirds sing beautifully.

750
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:33,760
It is not a bird!

751
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:36,069
Be quiet, wait.

752
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:59,440
- Wow, we're in a nice spot here!
- He's alone.

753
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:08,356
Give it to him.

754
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:13,191
Me? I'm a little shortsighted,
perhaps I'll miss.

755
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:18,353
You're lazy, like all
romans, not myopic.

756
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:21,720
That's it, would you shoot a Milanese.

757
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:23,676
This is not one.

758
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:28,840
For me we are all brothers,
and I am against the war.

759
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:32,800
- Not him though.
- What do you know about it?

760
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,756
What do you know?

761
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:37,393
You are right.

762
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:42,516
Tomorrow it could be him killing you.

763
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:45,156
Or you.

764
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:56,800
Let him finish the coffee.

765
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:10,316
Were you waiting for him to spot
you and get away? Let's go!

766
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:29,200
Loquenzi, leave the reprimand orders,
this is not the time for it.

767
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:32,160
- It is the order of this service.
- I have told you to leave it.

768
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:34,560
It seems that the austrians will attack us.

769
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:36,880
We'll set up a new
machinegun group.

770
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:40,880
We'll move our frontline about ten metres.

771
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:42,960
To the tiny position number 7.

772
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:47,080
- Then it'll be necessary to strengthen the barbed wire.
- How?

773
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:50,277
- How? With barbed wire!
- Yes Sir.

774
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:58,040
See, it's been a while since you wrote any.

775
01:16:58,040 --> 01:17:01,919
- Wrote what?
- Reprimand orders.

776
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:06,600
- You called for me, lieutenant?
- Yes.

777
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:09,560
Send two men to the depot.

778
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:13,160
Bring stakes and barbed wire
on the battalion's cart.

779
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:16,311
- We will place them tonight.
- Yes.

780
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:20,840
The ammunition boxes are protected, but accessible.

781
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:24,879
Take three men to carry the spool,
and three for earthing up, go.

782
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:28,160
- Ah! Loquenzi!
- I'm listening!

783
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:31,436
- Give headquarters the brandy.
- Yes Sir

784
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:36,240
Boys. Boys!

785
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:39,600
- What's up?
- We need someone to go to the depot.

786
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:41,480
Me!

787
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:43,520
I have finished with the lice,
I have nothing to do.

788
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:48,160
- We're always on patrol, we're
entitled to a change. - Everything is clean.

789
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:52,119
- Ok, you two.
- Let's go!

790
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:09,996
Oh, no!

791
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:15,959
- Alright, come forward with the letter.
- Thank you, lieutenant.

792
01:18:33,475 --> 01:18:36,283
Dear lieutenant,
The girlfriend of our young soldier

793
01:18:36,341 --> 01:18:42,141
is not the saint you think she is. She is
engaged to be married to an old but rich

794
01:18:42,145 --> 01:18:50,945
widower in our municipality. We trust you to
forward this message to our young soldier.

795
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:58,991
- Bad news?
- No, no.

796
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:01,920
- What does it say?
- One moment!

797
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:07,720
"My love, I'm fine and hope you are too.

798
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:10,473
I'm always thinking of you.
Greetings and kisses, Teresa."

799
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:13,913
- Take it.
- Thank you.

800
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:25,471
Why should both of us go to the
depot? One is enough, right?

801
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:28,596
For example?

802
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:33,757
For example you.
I have things to do in the village.

803
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:36,715
Really? Poor "chubby girl".

804
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:43,034
Fair enough, let's play for it...
No cheating!

805
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:49,716
I told you no cheating, ok?

806
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:52,916
How?

807
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:57,029
If it's a cross, I will go.
If it's a head, you will go.

808
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:01,354
Head, to the depository you will go.

809
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:13,158
- Don't you trust the toss?
- No.

810
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:15,476
- No?
- No.

811
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:24,880
- What is this?
- Head.

812
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:26,518
So? Sceptic!

813
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:32,915
- How did you do it? - Go!
- I want to learn this game too.

814
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,956
Damn!

815
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:28,356
Damn.

816
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:36,353
- Esteemed countess.
- Esteemed Marquis.

817
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:41,311
How's the girl doing, who made
me kiss her "farfalline" hands!

818
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:46,800
Do you think I'm from "soap mountain"?

819
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:51,240
The gentleman thinks I'm from those mountains, right?

820
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:53,880
No, handsome, no cheaters venture here.

821
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:58,880
- Give me my wallet, otherwise...
- Be nice!

822
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:02,953
No jokes with me girl! Understood?

823
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:05,036
My eyes!

824
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:09,676
I'll kill you!

825
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:15,040
Scoundrel! Come on!

826
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:17,480
Come here! Come!

827
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:19,277
- Come!
- Careful!

828
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:29,240
- I'll throw it in your face!
- I'm not moving.

829
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:34,200
Why do they take scoundrels
like you in the army?

830
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:38,751
If only the decent people
were to defend the country...

831
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:40,920
I salute you, fatherland!

832
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:43,400
- Take that away
- And you get lost!

833
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:45,595
And you give me my wallet!

834
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,833
- Take it!
- Damn Judas!

835
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:59,880
Countess, no offence,
but there was 25 liras here.

836
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:04,640
- You also want it full?
- 25 liras is too much for a...

837
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:08,838
For a chaste teacher,
and daughter of a colonel, right?

838
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:16,360
Laugh on! Ugly,
rotten, filthy, lazy fellow!

839
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:19,716
- You're quite a character!
- Shut up.

840
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:23,160
- Be careful!
- Leave it be!

841
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:25,116
I'm not moving.

842
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:33,600
There is a photo of a child in the wallet,
is it your child?

843
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:37,600
- No, it is me as a child.
- Idiot! You carry that around?

844
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:40,751
Yes, I am alone in the world.

845
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:49,593
- Me, I have a child. Look.
- Really? Let me see it.

846
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:56,799
Ah! Beautiful!

847
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:01,680
Chubby, isn't he? He must
eat well, he looks like a chicken.

848
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:06,708
He's with a nanny in Ponte San Fedele.
I sacrifice a lot for him!

849
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:15,440
What time is it?

850
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:17,908
It will be 8 soon.

851
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:24,876
I have to leave.

852
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:29,396
Will you come back?

853
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:33,073
Yes.

854
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:42,633
What's your name? Oh, yes, Giovanni.

855
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:47,469
You remembered it, right?

856
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:53,519
There are many Giovanni...

857
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:57,395
What has that got to do with it?

858
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:02,516
I don't know.

859
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:11,000
Bloody hell! I have it!

860
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:23,080
And the stakes?

861
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:25,840
- What?
- The stakes. - The stakes?

862
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:30,360
How stupid! I have packed
two tonnes of barbed wire

863
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:32,520
and I have forgotten the stakes, sorry!

864
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:34,680
Ok, I'll load the stakes.

865
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:39,600
- No stakes, they arrive later or tomorrow morning.
- I knew it!

866
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:42,880
We cannot wait, we must
return to the trenches.

867
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:45,000
- Tomorrow you will load them!
- Right, "gunner"!

868
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:48,390
- Who signs the receipt of withdrawal?
- I'll sign.

869
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:04,520
- Hey! Are you from the 6th battalion?
- 7th.

870
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:07,114
Take this, it's mail for the 7th.

871
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:15,040
- Look at this.
- What is it?

872
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:17,880
- It has arrived.
- The photo from L'Elica.

873
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:20,920
"For Rosario Nicotra, with affection.
Francesca Bertini."

874
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:24,160
What are you looking at?
Rosario will marry that girl!

875
01:26:24,160 --> 01:26:25,840
I like them more...

876
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:37,388
- It's coming from us.
- Sweet mother!

877
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:42,879
- Mother!
- It's definitely coming from us.

878
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:48,680
Hurry up! Highest priority! It's an attack!

879
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:50,671
- It's an attack.
- It's the attack.

880
01:26:57,800 --> 01:27:01,156
- What did the sergeant say?
- What he said?

881
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:05,360
- He said: Barbed wire and stakes.
- and stakes.

882
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:08,400
It's even written on the receipt of withdrawal.

883
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:12,320
- If we return without the stakes,
we'll be punished.  - Sure.

884
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:16,120
We have to wait until tomorrow
morning for the stakes.

885
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:18,953
- Patience.
- Shall we wait? - Yes, yes.

886
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:27,000
We should have the excuse
from the marshal in writing.

887
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:30,834
Sure, the rules are the
first priority of a soldier.

888
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:15,754
Hurry up with that cart!
Help the wounded!

889
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:23,638
- Hey! The first company.
- I don't know.

890
01:28:24,280 --> 01:28:26,236
Up there.

891
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:21,436
Father, come!

892
01:29:45,240 --> 01:29:47,196
Return to sender.

893
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,956
- Where?
- Down there.

894
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:59,880
- On the cart?
- No, the dead down there.

895
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:01,836
Some balls!

896
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:08,273
The Headquarter says 10 days of rest.

897
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:10,916
Come here.

898
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:28,034
Father, someone here should
ask you to for pardon.

899
01:30:29,320 --> 01:30:32,153
Even if we had been here,

900
01:30:32,680 --> 01:30:36,116
things wouldn't have gone any better.

901
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:44,156
Bordin?

902
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:49,990
He risked his life many
times for a little money

903
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:55,552
and this time he died for free.
Christ, where are you?

904
01:30:58,840 --> 01:31:00,720
He is here with us, sergeant.

905
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:04,429
If it's true he was 33 years old,
he'd be of generation '84.

906
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:13,798
Citizens, we have the privilege

907
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:16,960
of entertaining the glorious soldiers

908
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:19,836
who with their own blood

909
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:23,080
have fought back the enemy.

910
01:31:23,080 --> 01:31:29,474
I invite you to express to our corageous boys,

911
01:31:30,120 --> 01:31:34,320
your thankfulness, your affection...

912
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:36,276
Here come the soldiers!

913
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:35,680
Company... at-tention!

914
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:37,636
Present-weapon!

915
01:32:59,880 --> 01:33:02,720
"Hear the dead of Bezecca
and wait for them.

916
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:06,680
When, shouts Bronzetti, the ghost
arising from the clouds.

917
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:12,040
When the old find it necessary to
repeat, that one day, with black hair,

918
01:33:12,040 --> 01:33:14,480
the Trento will say goodbye to you.

919
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:18,800
When, quiver the young ones;
seeing quartermasters from San Giusto

920
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:20,760
laughing on the sea-green Adriatic.

921
01:33:20,760 --> 01:33:23,880
Oh, by the beautiful sea of Trieste,
on the hillocks,

922
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:26,600
the souls fly in with the new year..."

923
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:30,115
Hey, where have they sent us?

924
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:35,118
They should have sent us to Udine.
Women and local wine.

925
01:33:35,720 --> 01:33:41,033
- What is Udine? Paris?
- Look here, kid.

926
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:43,909
"Dance of the mimosas."

927
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:48,075
- Elegant stuff!
- Then let's go to the mimosas.

928
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:52,953
- And money for the train?
- We'll sneak on.

929
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:56,400
We'll be sneaking also when we get there.

930
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:59,160
Without money, the mimosas
won't look at you.

931
01:33:59,160 --> 01:34:03,480
"...in the face of the foreigner
who put up armed camps on our soil

932
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:08,395
sing: Italia! Italia! Italia! Italia!"

933
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:14,560
< I propose a toast!

934
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:18,720
In this moment our hearts

935
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:21,160
and our thankfulness

936
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:24,835
goes to all the heroic fighters

937
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:28,750
of our glorious and unconquered army.

938
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:36,840
Gentleman, gentlemen,
your thankfulness is nice,

939
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:38,640
in fact, it is very nice.

940
01:34:38,640 --> 01:34:41,880
But shouldn't we give some thoughts

941
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:46,720
to those of our our comrades who don't
have the pleasure of attending

942
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:48,680
this marvellous party tonight?

943
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:52,958
Friends, citizens, italian brothers!

944
01:34:53,680 --> 01:34:57,150
- I want to start a collect.
- Well done! I'll start!

945
01:34:57,400 --> 01:34:59,400
Always ready!

946
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:02,920
Hands off!

947
01:35:02,920 --> 01:35:05,480
Thank you, gentlemen.

948
01:35:05,480 --> 01:35:07,436
Thank you, thanks...

949
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:14,639
One for me and one for you.

950
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:18,073
One for me and one for you.

951
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:21,670
A... what patriots! A button!

952
01:35:21,880 --> 01:35:24,080
It's what I contributed.

953
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:26,800
One for me and one for you.

954
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:29,560
- The last two.
- Come on. - For you and for me.

955
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:32,560
It's not a large sum, but for
the mimosas it can be enough.

956
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:37,160
- Excuse me, you are of the 7th?
- Yes, the 7th.

957
01:35:37,160 --> 01:35:42,439
Do you know the soldier Bordin Giuseppe?

958
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:51,038
- Bordin Giuseppe?
- Yes.

959
01:35:51,560 --> 01:35:53,516
Yes.

960
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:59,000
I thought he would come
to relax with the the others

961
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,960
They will give him leave some other day.

962
01:36:01,960 --> 01:36:05,396
I'm sorry about it, because I have
brought him a package, and now...

963
01:36:05,960 --> 01:36:11,512
You seem very kind. Can I ask you a favour,
if it's not too much trouble?

964
01:36:11,680 --> 01:36:16,160
Would you be able to bring it to him?
You'd be doing me a favour.

965
01:36:16,160 --> 01:36:20,073
Tell him with the best of
wishes from his wife.

966
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:26,397
You see... we won't return to the
front line for a few days, and...

967
01:36:26,840 --> 01:36:29,560
- Really?
- Sure.

968
01:36:29,560 --> 01:36:32,438
It's not stuff that gets spoiled!

969
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:35,760
Just some pairs of wool socks.

970
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:39,753
It will be getting colder soon.

971
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:42,799
There is also some clean underwear.

972
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:48,760
You know what to say, right? I trust
you more than I do the postal service.

973
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:53,640
The last time I sent him a package,
he never received it.

974
01:36:53,640 --> 01:36:56,920
I'm sorry because I had
even put in some "galletti".

975
01:36:56,920 --> 01:37:01,118
They're biscuits... galletti!

976
01:37:01,240 --> 01:37:03,595
He likes them a lot!

977
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:09,195
He's so good! Always sends me
lots of money, did you know?

978
01:37:09,640 --> 01:37:12,598
We're so many in our family! Virgin Mary!

979
01:37:14,720 --> 01:37:19,080
I had hoped to see him also
because of this, because...

980
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:22,840
I'm not from here, I come
from the province of Padova.

981
01:37:22,840 --> 01:37:26,355
I had hoped he would give me some,
I really need it.

982
01:37:27,680 --> 01:37:31,309
Patience! There will be another time.

983
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:39,160
What are you doing?
No, for heaven's sake!

984
01:37:39,160 --> 01:37:41,116
I don't want it!

985
01:37:43,120 --> 01:37:45,076
Here.

986
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:50,560
- You can loan it to me. - Why?
We'll get them back from Bordin.

987
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:54,394
< Civitella, Udine!

988
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:56,720
Come, it's getting late.

989
01:37:56,720 --> 01:38:00,076
Thank you. Thank you so much.

990
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:14,914
Let her get on board.

991
01:38:22,440 --> 01:38:26,120
- Goodbye.
- Thanks, and give my greetings to my husband!

992
01:38:26,120 --> 01:38:28,076
Thanks so much!

993
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:50,913
- Goodbye mimosas!
- What twerps we are!

994
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:54,439
Stop it! Let's hear some dance music.

995
01:38:54,760 --> 01:38:57,228
At your service! Here it comes.

996
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:25,553
Giovanni, take the old woman!

997
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:31,790
- Do you allow?
- Do you want a slap? Get lost!

998
01:39:38,920 --> 01:39:41,593
Come, come and dance!

999
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:05,000
< Listen! Quiet!

1000
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:09,000
Silence! Leaves of absence are withdrawn!

1001
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:13,120
All military on leave or on permission
will return to their divisions.

1002
01:40:13,120 --> 01:40:17,120
- Why?
- It seems that the enemy is still here,

1003
01:40:17,120 --> 01:40:19,680
and in some parts he
has been successful.

1004
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:06,237
- Who are you?
- Second lieutenant Loquenzi, seventh regiment.

1005
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:09,920
You're not many.

1006
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:14,880
At the Osteria Zanin there is a stronghold.
Go there, it's 30 kilometres.

1007
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:18,520
- Is there artillery there, major?
- Who knows?

1008
01:41:18,520 --> 01:41:22,080
All we know is the Osteria Zanin
must be defended at any costs.

1009
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:24,960
Go there, and find captain Castelli.

1010
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:28,040
- Castelli? The one in command at Tigliano?
- Yes!

1011
01:41:28,040 --> 01:41:32,318
- Commander "Round Stamp"! We're better off dead!
- Silence.

1012
01:41:33,200 --> 01:41:35,200
- Where are we?
- At the Piave river.

1013
01:41:35,200 --> 01:41:39,352
- We've walked far!
- We're on the San Fedele bridge.

1014
01:41:40,240 --> 01:41:42,674
- San Fedele bridge?
- Yes.

1015
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:49,880
- Goddamn it! - Where are you going?
- Where are you going? - I'll be back right away.

1016
01:41:49,880 --> 01:41:51,836
Where are you going, Giovanni?

1017
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:14,116
- Do you know Tommasino, Costantina's child?
- Up there.

1018
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:16,356
Thank you.

1019
01:42:25,080 --> 01:42:29,120
- Excuse me, is that Costantina's child?
- Yes, why?

1020
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:32,240
- I want to know if I can help you with anything.
- This one has stolen my seat from me.

1021
01:42:32,240 --> 01:42:35,800
- That's not true, I have the right...
- Get lost.

1022
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:38,880
Give her back the place, you pig!

1023
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:40,393
Thanks!

1024
01:42:49,400 --> 01:42:51,755
- How are you?
- How are you?

1025
01:42:52,680 --> 01:42:55,640
Giovanni, they are leaving!

1026
01:42:55,640 --> 01:42:57,596
Ok, come here.

1027
01:42:58,680 --> 01:43:04,232
- Costantina!
- Give this to the woman with the child.

1028
01:43:09,560 --> 01:43:12,600
How you did you remember the name of the village?

1029
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:16,800
Because... once I had a dog named that.

1030
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:20,918
- San Fedele bridge?
- No, only Fedele.

1031
01:43:22,920 --> 01:43:26,799
So... do you remember my name?

1032
01:43:28,360 --> 01:43:30,794
Yes... but not your last name.

1033
01:43:31,400 --> 01:43:33,391
Only the fatherhood.

1034
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:39,000
I read it on the card when I had the wallet.

1035
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:42,276
So... is it a dishonor?

1036
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:45,476
No, I am like you.

1037
01:43:46,160 --> 01:43:48,120
Daughter of N.N.?

1038
01:43:48,120 --> 01:43:51,560
We're here because there
is this fondness between us!

1039
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:54,154
We are a little related.

1040
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:58,230
Where are they sending you?

1041
01:43:59,080 --> 01:44:01,389
I don't know.

1042
01:44:02,920 --> 01:44:05,520
And you, where are you going?

1043
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:10,799
- I don't know, I want to take the child
away from here. - That is wise.

1044
01:44:16,760 --> 01:44:18,955
- Are you comfortable?
- Yes.

1045
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:22,836
Frou-frou!

1046
01:44:26,720 --> 01:44:30,760
- How many meals does he get per day?
- Why do you care?

1047
01:44:30,760 --> 01:44:35,117
He is blessed to be born in 1916!
He'll never have to fight wars.

1048
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:37,680
- Let me...
- Stop it will you!

1049
01:44:37,680 --> 01:44:41,434
< Hey, I'm leaving!
Who doesn't come now is left here!

1050
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:47,840
Ok... bye.

1051
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:50,195
- Bye.
- I...

1052
01:44:54,480 --> 01:44:55,959
Me too.

1053
01:44:57,400 --> 01:44:59,630
- Bye.
- Bye.

1054
01:45:08,600 --> 01:45:10,318
I'll write to you!

1055
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:18,240
- Will you remain in the 7th?
- I don't know,

1056
01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:20,196
but write anyway!

1057
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:25,920
Poor children, who knows if
you will ever see each other again.

1058
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:27,876
Smack it!

1059
01:45:30,680 --> 01:45:32,079
Bye.

1060
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:38,356
Did you see the nanny?

1061
01:45:39,720 --> 01:45:41,676
What have you got there?

1062
01:45:42,600 --> 01:45:44,556
They stuck on me.

1063
01:45:57,720 --> 01:45:59,920
You two, where are you going?

1064
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:01,800
I knew it!

1065
01:46:01,800 --> 01:46:04,760
- We were going to the carrier.
- Over here.

1066
01:46:04,760 --> 01:46:06,716
Let's go.

1067
01:46:56,440 --> 01:46:59,318
- Where is captain Castelli?
- Inside!

1068
01:47:06,280 --> 01:47:09,238
- Captain Castelli?
- Speak. - At your service.

1069
01:47:09,320 --> 01:47:11,834
- I have some men outside.
- Let them stay there.

1070
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:15,840
It's about twenty, plus the lieutenant.
The rest I have to take with me.

1071
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:18,880
Tell the commander to stay in
contact with the battery.

1072
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:22,480
- You're lucky to still have a telephone.
- Yes Sir.

1073
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:25,840
The hard fact is that you have
to resist until tomorrow morning.

1074
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:29,400
Tonight the engineers will
build a bridge at Pederobba.

1075
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:32,240
If the enemy don't spot it,
we can bring in reinforcements.

1076
01:47:32,240 --> 01:47:35,560
The austrians will be forced to stop if
we can "hold the fort" here.

1077
01:47:35,560 --> 01:47:38,120
We've had nothing but
bread here for a long time!

1078
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:41,073
Let's start, we'll get them working!

1079
01:47:43,400 --> 01:47:48,640
Guys, this position of vital importance.

1080
01:47:48,640 --> 01:47:52,120
A few kilometres from here is the Piave,
and we have to resist,

1081
01:47:52,120 --> 01:47:56,160
at least until tomorrow morning.
Let's hope we survive.

1082
01:47:56,160 --> 01:47:58,116
Who of you has a grade?

1083
01:47:58,880 --> 01:48:02,720
- No one.
- From this moment on you're a corporal.

1084
01:48:02,720 --> 01:48:07,080
We must get out a cannon
buried behind the Osteria.

1085
01:48:07,080 --> 01:48:09,480
Busacca, Pira, Iacovacci, go.

1086
01:48:09,480 --> 01:48:13,160
You cut down all the trees.
Those out there.

1087
01:48:13,160 --> 01:48:16,550
- Why?
- What is it, Zanin?

1088
01:48:17,480 --> 01:48:21,120
- Isn't it ok?
- Those trees were planted by my father.

1089
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:25,320
And we uproot them, we won't
give the austrians cover.

1090
01:48:25,320 --> 01:48:29,080
- You, go up on the roof and be a look-out.
- Yes Sir.

1091
01:48:29,080 --> 01:48:32,920
- It is raining hard, captain!
- What do you want from me? Do it!

1092
01:48:32,920 --> 01:48:37,118
- Report everything you see!
- Yes Sir!

1093
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:41,960
- The trees are gone.
- Now break all window glasses.

1094
01:48:41,960 --> 01:48:43,916
Goddamn it!

1095
01:48:44,440 --> 01:48:48,960
Zanin brothers, what would you have us do?
We're at war, right?

1096
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:52,080
We have to break the glasses, because tonight
we will have the moon opposite us,

1097
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:54,440
and we don't want to help the snipers.

1098
01:48:54,440 --> 01:48:56,829
- Alright!
- Sure.

1099
01:48:57,400 --> 01:48:59,160
Listen,

1100
01:48:59,160 --> 01:49:02,600
We need to find some black paint,
for the facade.

1101
01:49:02,600 --> 01:49:05,831
- As it is, it looks like the cardboard we
use for target-shooting. - All right.

1102
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:09,756
Pull!

1103
01:49:11,320 --> 01:49:13,276
Pull!

1104
01:49:14,480 --> 01:49:18,360
- You too have to pull!
- I'm an officer!

1105
01:49:18,360 --> 01:49:22,960
Then be an officer who pushes,
or I won't push either!

1106
01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:26,032
Ok, I'll help you.

1107
01:49:33,160 --> 01:49:36,357
Fast, we must paint this part also.

1108
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,640
Hey! What are you writing?

1109
01:49:50,640 --> 01:49:55,720
< There! I have seen them!
They're coming! Coming!

1110
01:49:55,720 --> 01:49:58,360
There, look!

1111
01:49:58,360 --> 01:50:01,760
They are making light signals! Look!

1112
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:03,796
Stop making all that noise!

1113
01:50:05,600 --> 01:50:07,556
Here we are.

1114
01:50:16,240 --> 01:50:20,640
Absolute silence from this moment on,
extinguish all lights and cigarettes.

1115
01:50:20,640 --> 01:50:23,400
Have two men bring a message to the battery.

1116
01:50:23,400 --> 01:50:26,437
- Choose the less... efficient.
- Yes.

1117
01:50:34,200 --> 01:50:38,830
- My god, I can't cope any more. I need to stop!
- We'll stop!

1118
01:50:39,640 --> 01:50:42,473
- Down there is a wagon.
- Where? - There.

1119
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:44,596
- Good!
- Let's go.

1120
01:50:50,200 --> 01:50:52,156
Look at him sleeping!

1121
01:50:52,440 --> 01:50:54,396
Wake up!

1122
01:51:14,480 --> 01:51:16,596
Come on, we're there.

1123
01:51:18,920 --> 01:51:22,960
- Who's there?
- First you shoot, and then you ask who it is?

1124
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:26,560
Better a dead friend that a living enemy!
Who is it?

1125
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:30,400
- We're "the ghost of those you killed"!
- Pass.

1126
01:51:30,400 --> 01:51:32,356
Let's go.

1127
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,720
We're from the Osteria Zanin, captain.

1128
01:51:39,720 --> 01:51:42,000
I'm the oldest, I'll speak.

1129
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:46,760
At the Osteria Zanin there is a
stronghold with about thirty men.

1130
01:51:46,760 --> 01:51:48,880
Another stronghold is at Borgo Pr.

1131
01:51:48,880 --> 01:51:52,240
The austrians will attack,
we must resist until dawn.

1132
01:51:52,240 --> 01:51:56,240
Tonight our people will build a
pontoon bridge for a counterattack.

1133
01:51:56,240 --> 01:51:58,196
- Where?
- At Pederobba.

1134
01:51:58,600 --> 01:52:01,880
Pederobba, Pederobba...
Yes, that is correct.

1135
01:52:01,880 --> 01:52:04,400
Perhaps we'll be able to fight
back those damn austrians!

1136
01:52:04,400 --> 01:52:06,880
That is necessary, captain.
Do your best!

1137
01:52:06,880 --> 01:52:10,160
Messengers! Give my greetings to
captain Castelli, best of luck.

1138
01:52:10,160 --> 01:52:14,039
- Give these two friends a bottle of wine.
- Thank you, captain.

1139
01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:23,600
Observatory?

1140
01:52:23,600 --> 01:52:27,388
Captain Soligo speaking, get me
lieutenant Locatelli's office.

1141
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:34,040
Locatelli, try at once to locate Pederobba,

1142
01:52:34,040 --> 01:52:37,200
and signal our position
with the electric lantern.

1143
01:52:37,200 --> 01:52:38,920
Try!

1144
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:41,200
I can't tell you,

1145
01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:44,320
but if Pederobba answers,
you will understand why.

1146
01:52:44,320 --> 01:52:46,151
Thank you, bye.

1147
01:52:47,480 --> 01:52:52,040
- Don't you eat here? You're only drinking?
- We have found only wine.

1148
01:52:52,040 --> 01:52:54,349
What happened to your hand?

1149
01:52:55,120 --> 01:52:59,160
- I don't have the hand anymore.
- And you are still here? They must send you away.

1150
01:52:59,160 --> 01:53:01,116
Where?

1151
01:53:04,040 --> 01:53:05,996
See how it rains!

1152
01:53:22,680 --> 01:53:24,880
This rain will kill us!

1153
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:28,509
- How far are we from the stronghold?
- Six kilometres.

1154
01:53:35,440 --> 01:53:39,920
- I have the same idea you have.
We have done our duty. - Yes.

1155
01:53:39,920 --> 01:53:43,435
- Just one day and we'll go back.
- Sure.

1156
01:53:54,120 --> 01:53:56,236
The other stall.

1157
01:53:57,880 --> 01:53:59,632
Close the gate.

1158
01:54:07,640 --> 01:54:09,517
- Hold it.
- Give it to me.

1159
01:54:12,640 --> 01:54:14,596
So nice here!

1160
01:54:34,560 --> 01:54:37,074
General, from the 22nd observatory.

1161
01:54:38,840 --> 01:54:41,920
- Are we in connection with the haystack battery?
- Yes.

1162
01:54:41,920 --> 01:54:45,913
Give orders to the battery
to fall back to sector 28.

1163
01:54:46,280 --> 01:54:49,720
We need them to fire between
the 31st and the 37nd.

1164
01:54:49,720 --> 01:54:54,032
The haystacks are too exposed anyway,
they could be cut off.

1165
01:55:24,200 --> 01:55:26,156
Hey!

1166
01:55:26,520 --> 01:55:30,593
- What's happening?
- Do you hear? They're hitting the Zanin.

1167
01:55:38,280 --> 01:55:43,991
What luck! We could have been there!
Right in the mouth of "Cecco Peppe" [Austrian emperor].

1168
01:56:16,280 --> 01:56:19,880
They're are inhabitants of Bergamo,
they're your fellow townsmen.

1169
01:56:19,880 --> 01:56:22,235
One of them said  "commendatur".

1170
01:56:23,280 --> 01:56:26,397
"Commandantur", idiot!

1171
01:56:27,680 --> 01:56:30,240
They're Austrians?

1172
01:56:35,240 --> 01:56:36,992
What about our people?

1173
01:56:42,240 --> 01:56:46,631
Oreste, we have to get
our asses out of here.

1174
01:56:47,640 --> 01:56:50,029
These don't take prisoners.

1175
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:53,199
How do we do it?

1176
01:58:56,560 --> 01:59:00,997
You're dressed up as our soldiers?
Tell me why.

1177
01:59:03,760 --> 01:59:07,150
You can speak, you're the oldest.

1178
01:59:09,200 --> 01:59:13,520
- You are spies, right?
- No, we are Italian soldiers.

1179
01:59:13,520 --> 01:59:17,160
Look underneath. See?
Look underneath.

1180
01:59:17,160 --> 01:59:19,879
Underneath... but not over.

1181
01:59:21,240 --> 01:59:25,153
You're making a mistake...
we didn't mean to offend anyone.

1182
01:59:25,800 --> 01:59:28,320
At first, our battery was here.

1183
01:59:28,320 --> 01:59:31,640
A captain was sitting in your place.

1184
01:59:31,640 --> 01:59:34,800
We came to deliver the message
from captain "Round Stamp",

1185
01:59:34,800 --> 01:59:37,678
that a pontoon bridge is being built at...

1186
01:59:44,800 --> 01:59:46,756
Pontoon bridge?

1187
01:59:53,880 --> 01:59:59,000
I repeat the question: Pontoon bridge?

1188
02:00:00,120 --> 02:00:02,076
Say something, please.

1189
02:00:03,360 --> 02:00:06,720
He is drunk, he wanted to
say San Fedele bridge.

1190
02:00:06,720 --> 02:00:11,440
At first we were in that little village,
then we were sent here.

1191
02:00:11,440 --> 02:00:15,680
And this captain "Round Stamp"...
do you know why he is called that?

1192
02:00:15,680 --> 02:00:17,636
Answer the question.

1193
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:21,960
Do you know why?

1194
02:01:03,960 --> 02:01:06,760
Goddamn Roman bigmouth!

1195
02:01:06,760 --> 02:01:12,000
Why did you speak of the pontoon bridge?
Damn idiot!

1196
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:15,000
If our people hear of it they will shoot us!

1197
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,760
Why, do you think they will let us go?

1198
02:01:17,760 --> 02:01:20,800
These will fight on in a prisoner's camp,

1199
02:01:20,800 --> 02:01:25,320
naked, without eating, with shovels!
Why did I follow you!

1200
02:01:25,320 --> 02:01:29,040
Kid, who had the idea to sleep here?

1201
02:01:29,040 --> 02:01:32,320
You've been my downfall
from the first day I met you!

1202
02:01:32,320 --> 02:01:34,760
Scoundrel, Roman squealer!

1203
02:01:34,760 --> 02:01:38,389
"We are all brothers!"
That's our brothers for you!

1204
02:01:39,600 --> 02:01:43,720
They will finish us off like the cow that was here

1205
02:01:43,720 --> 02:01:46,360
- So now they're even cannibals!
- Perhaps!

1206
02:01:46,360 --> 02:01:53,320
- Idiot! - What do you know?
Have you seen the eyes of the captain?

1207
02:01:53,320 --> 02:01:56,915
All white... full of blood.

1208
02:01:57,480 --> 02:02:01,280
- He looked like a crazy person!
- He looked at the captain's eyes!

1209
02:02:01,280 --> 02:02:04,033
He looked like a crazy person with those eyes!

1210
02:02:07,880 --> 02:02:12,120
- Do you only have that chewing tobacco left?
- Yes.

1211
02:02:12,120 --> 02:02:14,793
Give it to me!

1212
02:02:16,560 --> 02:02:20,599
Come on, give it to me.
Give me a match.

1213
02:02:23,160 --> 02:02:25,116
What misfortune!

1214
02:02:29,240 --> 02:02:32,755
Do you know I still don't understand you?

1215
02:02:34,720 --> 02:02:36,676
I do understand you.

1216
02:02:49,280 --> 02:02:50,793
Shake hands?

1217
02:02:51,920 --> 02:02:53,876
Why?

1218
02:02:54,680 --> 02:02:58,800
- I don't know.
- So? - Maybe we'll get separated.

1219
02:02:58,800 --> 02:03:00,836
Why would they separate us?

1220
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:04,916
Nothing will happen.

1221
02:03:17,640 --> 02:03:20,074
Ok, we're coming.

1222
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:38,160
My headquarter wants to know where
this pontoon bridge is located.

1223
02:03:38,160 --> 02:03:40,515
Talk.

1224
02:03:41,680 --> 02:03:45,150
Don't waste your words denying.

1225
02:03:45,880 --> 02:03:51,720
I'll add that if you don't tell me the
location of the pontoon bridge,

1226
02:03:51,720 --> 02:03:54,678
I will have you shot immediately.

1227
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:59,391
Your fake uniforms allow me to do it. Sorry.

1228
02:04:06,240 --> 02:04:08,196
Stay firm!

1229
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:11,869
Excuse me, do you allow us a moment?

1230
02:04:12,280 --> 02:04:14,236
Please.

1231
02:04:19,160 --> 02:04:21,116
Damn shit!

1232
02:04:21,600 --> 02:04:24,990
- So?
- So? So what?

1233
02:04:25,800 --> 02:04:29,200
- They're asking, right?
- Do you want to get killed?

1234
02:04:29,200 --> 02:04:30,720
- I will tell them.
- Wait!

1235
02:04:34,160 --> 02:04:36,116
Let's go.

1236
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:43,356
- We have decided... right?
- Yes, yes.

1237
02:04:44,240 --> 02:04:46,276
We'll tell you.

1238
02:05:04,014 --> 02:05:07,025
I thought you would be more
brave, especially the tall one

1239
02:05:09,400 --> 02:05:15,157
"Guts"! They only know liver,
venetian style, with onions!

1240
02:05:16,600 --> 02:05:18,875
Soon we will have some also.

1241
02:05:19,680 --> 02:05:21,910
Well? Where?

1242
02:05:25,440 --> 02:05:27,396
If I say...

1243
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:29,831
what's in it for me?

1244
02:05:30,560 --> 02:05:32,516
Excuse me?

1245
02:05:35,760 --> 02:05:37,113
- Giovanni...
- Stay firm.

1246
02:05:41,720 --> 02:05:44,632
Then...listen to this.

1247
02:05:46,440 --> 02:05:48,510
Since you talk like that

1248
02:05:50,800 --> 02:05:54,634
I won't tell you anything.

1249
02:05:55,280 --> 02:05:59,239
Have you understood, shit face?

1250
02:07:06,040 --> 02:07:09,077
What, are you crazy?

1251
02:07:10,800 --> 02:07:13,160
Do you kill people just like that?

1252
02:07:13,160 --> 02:07:17,472
- So?
- Who will tell you where the bridge is now?

1253
02:07:17,880 --> 02:07:20,480
Only he knew! I don't know anything!

1254
02:07:20,480 --> 02:07:22,914
- What will you tell your headquarters?
- So?

1255
02:07:25,880 --> 02:07:27,836
So what?

1256
02:07:30,040 --> 02:07:32,349
But you think...

1257
02:07:33,080 --> 02:07:35,958
Excuse me, did you think I knew it?

1258
02:07:36,400 --> 02:07:39,551
I know nothing.
I don't know anything!

1259
02:07:39,680 --> 02:07:42,560
Captain, I was in the medical corps.

1260
02:07:42,560 --> 02:07:46,320
I don't know anything, they
never told us soldiers anything.

1261
02:07:46,320 --> 02:07:50,598
They didn't tell us those things!
I don't know anything, captain!

1262
02:08:18,880 --> 02:08:20,836
No!

1263
02:08:23,200 --> 02:08:25,156
No!

1264
02:08:26,120 --> 02:08:28,839
Giovanni, I am afraid.

1265
02:08:31,920 --> 02:08:35,160
I don't know it anything!
If I knew it, I would tell!

1266
02:08:35,160 --> 02:08:38,277
I'm a coward, everyone knows that!

1267
02:09:45,080 --> 02:09:47,036
Fire!

1268
02:10:29,600 --> 02:10:31,830
They're pulling back!

1269
02:10:32,040 --> 02:10:35,396
- They're coming, sergeant!
- Yes, they're coming!

1270
02:10:55,960 --> 02:11:00,636
Even this time those two
slackers got away easy.
