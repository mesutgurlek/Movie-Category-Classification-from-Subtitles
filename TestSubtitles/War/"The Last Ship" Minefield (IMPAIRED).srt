Kudelski, did you hear the
captain's order to belay?

164
00:08:17,043 --> 00:08:18,242
It's moving, sir.

165
00:08:18,244 --> 00:08:19,943
- Kudelski.
- Sir.

166
00:08:19,945 --> 00:08:22,146
This mine here. It's
beginning to vibrate.

167
00:08:22,148 --> 00:08:23,280
Kudelski!

168
00:08:23,282 --> 00:08:25,716
- Wolf: Out of the water!
- Back up!

169
00:08:25,718 --> 00:08:27,251
- Out of the water now!
- Back up, now!

170
00:08:29,722 --> 00:08:33,490
Deploy retrieval teams. Everyone
out of the water now!

171
00:08:33,492 --> 00:08:36,393
Wolf: All teams out of the water!

172
00:08:36,395 --> 00:08:39,229
Oh, Jesus, Kudelski's [Groans]

[Dog barking in distance]

175
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:14,076
Captain.

176
00:09:14,078 --> 00:09:15,311
Come.

177
00:09:15,313 --> 00:09:18,347
Bring your doctor.

180
00:09:45,009 --> 00:09:49,045
Rios: High fever.

181
00:09:50,581 --> 00:09:51,881
Jaundice.

182
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:54,684
She has red flu, but
the blood is not working.

183
00:09:54,686 --> 00:09:56,218
Her pulse is elevated.

184
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,155
She may have the red
flu, but she also has malaria.

185
00:09:59,157 --> 00:10:01,791
That's what's causing all this.

186
00:10:02,627 --> 00:10:04,827
Are you sure?

187
00:10:04,829 --> 00:10:06,395
She has all the symptoms.

188
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,717
I don't need to tell you about
all the mosquitos out there.

189
00:10:09,367 --> 00:10:12,068
What do we need?

190
00:10:19,477 --> 00:10:21,877
No, there's nothing in
here. I need antibiotics.

191
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,855
She's your wife.

192
00:10:37,862 --> 00:10:41,297
God damn sons of bitches!

193
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:43,566
You find Kudelski?

194
00:10:43,568 --> 00:10:45,134
Nothing to find, sir.

195
00:10:45,136 --> 00:10:46,969
Wolf: Did you see that?

196
00:10:46,971 --> 00:10:48,559
After the explosion?

197
00:10:48,584 --> 00:10:50,306
The mines dropped their anchoring chains.

198
00:10:50,308 --> 00:10:52,775
- All of them?
- That means they're sensing something.

199
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,543
Blast must've triggered them, huh?

200
00:10:54,545 --> 00:10:57,179
Well, we should be able to
push them out the way then, right?

201
00:10:57,181 --> 00:10:58,881
- They're floating free?
- I don't know.

202
00:10:58,883 --> 00:11:01,450
I just know I don't like it.

203
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,719
Neither do I.

204

[Indistinct conversation]

205
00:11:11,729 --> 00:11:14,263
Michener: Good to see you, Senator.

206
00:11:14,265 --> 00:11:15,264
Manuel, welcome.

207
00:11:15,266 --> 00:11:17,266
Thank you, Mr. President.

208
00:11:17,268 --> 00:11:20,536
Al, Roberta, Randall, sit down.

209
00:11:20,538 --> 00:11:22,338
Please, sit down.

210
00:11:24,575 --> 00:11:26,275
Thanks for taking the
time, Mr. President.

211
00:11:26,277 --> 00:11:27,743
I know it's not been easy.

212
00:11:27,745 --> 00:11:29,378
Well, I appreciate
you making the trip here.

213
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,046
Obviously, we have a lot to discuss,

214
00:11:31,048 --> 00:11:33,215
so I think we should just jump in.

215
00:11:33,217 --> 00:11:36,786
Danny: Is it possible the explosion
knocked them all free?

216
00:11:36,788 --> 00:11:38,087
If it was powerful enough to do that,

217
00:11:38,089 --> 00:11:39,488
none of us would be standing here.

218
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,790
That coil there.

219
00:11:40,792 --> 00:11:42,391
Maybe it's some kind of sensor.

220
00:11:42,393 --> 00:11:43,959
To make the mines drop their chains?

221
00:11:43,961 --> 00:11:45,227
What would that even accomplish?

222
00:11:45,229 --> 00:11:46,929
Well, look at that
there, behind the coil.

223
00:11:46,931 --> 00:11:48,998
Is that... is that moving?

224
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,467
If it is, it could be a motor.

225
00:11:51,469 --> 00:11:53,269
Is that even possible?

226
00:11:53,271 --> 00:11:55,037
I've seen hundreds of mines.

227
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:56,939
Never anything like that before.

228
00:11:56,941 --> 00:11:59,008
Chandler: It's an improvised weapon.

229
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,076
Anything's possible.

230
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:05,347
Sonar, you getting any kind of low hum?

231
00:12:10,588 --> 00:12:11,921
I got something.

232
00:12:11,923 --> 00:12:13,456
Very faint, sir.

233
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:16,392
I thought it was the echo
off the coral of our gear, but...

234
00:12:16,394 --> 00:12:21,897
TAO, take a listen.

235
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,706
It's barely audible.

236
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:34,310
Could it be the hum of a motor?

237
00:12:35,346 --> 00:12:36,645
It's getting louder.

238
00:12:36,647 --> 00:12:38,347
Where's it coming from?

239
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:44,954
It's coming from all around
us, from all directions.

240
00:12:44,956 --> 00:12:47,256
That third mine has its own engine.

241
00:12:47,258 --> 00:12:48,924
The sounds are getting closer.

242
00:12:48,926 --> 00:12:52,061
Mines are coming right at us.

243
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:57,299
So Nathan James is trapped in
this minefield as we speak!

244
00:12:57,301 --> 00:12:58,601
Michener: That's right.

245
00:12:58,603 --> 00:13:00,269
And when did Chandler leave Hong Kong?

246
00:13:00,271 --> 00:13:01,670
After the kidnapping occurred.

247
00:13:01,672 --> 00:13:03,839
Beatty: At which point
Peng, the president of China,

248
00:13:03,841 --> 00:13:05,512
tried to blow up his plane?

249
00:13:05,673 --> 00:13:07,843
Captain Chandler's
certain that's the case, sir.

250
00:13:07,845 --> 00:13:09,278
And now he's taken the helm

251
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,113
and is personally
leading the rescue mission.

252
00:13:11,115 --> 00:13:12,748
Not quite how you presented it to us.

253
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,083
Well, I'm sure you can understand

254
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:15,751
I didn't feel comfortable
discussing the details

255
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,319
over our video-conference systems.

256
00:13:17,321 --> 00:13:18,888
Well, I suppose it's a good thing

257
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,289
we showed up here today, then.

258
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:22,691
Yes, it is, and I
appreciate your support, as always.

259
00:13:22,693 --> 00:13:25,494
Beatty: At the risk of
sounding cold-hearted, I'll be blunt.

260
00:13:25,496 --> 00:13:28,497
These events in Asia are
coming at a bad time.

261
00:13:28,499 --> 00:13:30,055
Our constituents in the territories

262
00:13:30,057 --> 00:13:31,356
are still reeling from the plague

263
00:13:31,358 --> 00:13:32,924
and the chaos that followed.

264
00:13:32,926 --> 00:13:34,526
This situation across the globe,

265
00:13:34,528 --> 00:13:36,895
coupled with tensions over construction...

266
00:13:36,897 --> 00:13:39,064
we're seeing
demonstrations in the streets.

267
00:13:39,066 --> 00:13:41,600
They're not peaceful vigils like
you've got going on here.

268
00:13:41,602 --> 00:13:45,370
We-We've got people on the
brink of... of rioting, Mr. President.

269
00:13:45,372 --> 00:13:46,838
I understand.

270
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,875
So what can I do to help?

271
00:13:49,877 --> 00:13:51,176
Cancel the ration cards.

272
00:13:51,178 --> 00:13:52,844
Restore the land-claim rights.

273
00:13:52,846 --> 00:13:54,112
Open the markets.

274
00:13:54,114 --> 00:13:56,381
Rescind all of my domestic policies.

275
00:13:56,383 --> 00:13:58,450
They're not working and
people aren't happy.

276
00:13:58,452 --> 00:13:59,851
There's not much more they can take...

277
00:13:59,853 --> 00:14:01,386
You think you can waltz in here

278
00:14:01,388 --> 00:14:03,322
and leverage this crisis to muscle me?

279
00:14:03,324 --> 00:14:05,424
Look, when you closed
the banks for a month

280
00:14:05,426 --> 00:14:07,225
and then reopened them with
limited withdrawals,

281
00:14:07,227 --> 00:14:10,696
we supported you even though
our people were up in arms.

282
00:14:10,698 --> 00:14:12,197
When you used the military

283
00:14:12,199 --> 00:14:15,067
to forcibly remove
refugees from their shelters...

284
00:14:15,069 --> 00:14:17,235
Those weren't shelters.
Those were land grabs...

285
00:14:17,237 --> 00:14:19,971
people squatting in homes of
surviving plague victims,

286
00:14:19,973 --> 00:14:21,907
pushing out surviving family members

287
00:14:21,909 --> 00:14:23,742
who had a legitimate right to be there.

288
00:14:23,744 --> 00:14:26,211
- That is an oversimplification, sir.
- Is it?

289
00:14:26,213 --> 00:14:28,347
I'm living in a hotel next door.

290
00:14:28,349 --> 00:14:31,450
I've seen where you
live, Manuel, in that mansion.

291
00:14:31,452 --> 00:14:33,285
It's quite an upgrade from
your previous home.

292
00:14:33,287 --> 00:14:35,053
Tell me, do you even
know who it belongs to?

293
00:14:35,055 --> 00:14:36,388
Beatty: There's no reason

294
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,357
to make this personal, Mr. President.

295
00:14:38,359 --> 00:14:40,892
We're here to help
you as much as ourselves.

296
00:14:40,894 --> 00:14:42,094
You're weak right now.

297
00:14:42,096 --> 00:14:44,596
With what's going on overseas...

298
00:14:44,598 --> 00:14:46,131
people are losing faith.

299
00:14:46,133 --> 00:14:48,266
You can't solve Asia... fine.

300
00:14:48,268 --> 00:14:51,570
Then give the
people something they want.

301
00:14:51,572 --> 00:14:54,373
And if I don't?

302
00:14:55,376 --> 00:14:58,043
I only have so much
control over my region.

303
00:14:58,045 --> 00:15:00,312
Some of our truckers may decide
they no longer want to volunteer

304
00:15:00,314 --> 00:15:02,047
to make those long-haul shipments

305
00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:03,582
all the way to the heartland.

306
00:15:03,584 --> 00:15:05,984
Suddenly, your people don't
have the supplies they need,

307
00:15:05,986 --> 00:15:10,122
then you don't have candles
out there, you've got pitchforks.

308
00:15:13,727 --> 00:15:15,026
[Sighs]

309
00:15:15,028 --> 00:15:19,531
Gentlemen, Mrs. Price, I'll remind you

310
00:15:19,533 --> 00:15:24,369
that we were sitting around this
table just five months ago.

311
00:15:24,371 --> 00:15:26,538
We put our hands together and we agreed

312
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,540
that this was the best arrangement

313
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:30,642
for the country under reconstruction.

314
00:15:30,644 --> 00:15:33,044
The presidency, here, in St. Louis

315
00:15:33,046 --> 00:15:36,014
with the Chief of Staff and my
Secretary of Foreign Affairs

316
00:15:36,016 --> 00:15:38,583
chosen from your regions.

317
00:15:38,585 --> 00:15:41,653
Senator Beatty with the
constitutional authority

318
00:15:41,655 --> 00:15:45,557
to ratify certain new laws,
and I thank you for that...

319
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:48,260
and an expectation that all of you

320
00:15:48,262 --> 00:15:51,563
would try to maintain
control over your regions

321
00:15:51,565 --> 00:15:55,367
until we sorted out how the
boundaries could be drawn

322
00:15:55,369 --> 00:15:57,502
or whether or not we
needed to elect new governors.

323
00:15:57,504 --> 00:16:01,673
Now, we've got congressional
elections coming up next month,

324
00:16:01,675 --> 00:16:06,111
after which the people, through
the voice of the new Congress,

325
00:16:06,113 --> 00:16:09,648
can decide whether or
not to retain my policies.

326
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:15,120
Until then, I say this... get
a handle on your people.

327
00:16:15,122 --> 00:16:18,557
If you can't and you really fear rioting,

328
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:21,526
I will not hesitate to use
the full force of our armed forces

329
00:16:21,528 --> 00:16:24,329
to maintain order in this country.

330
00:16:29,236 --> 00:16:31,736
Now, I have a job to do, and so do you.

331
00:16:31,738 --> 00:16:36,908
As your president, I
advise all of you to get to it.

If I can't get the fever
spikes under control...

343
00:17:43,389 --> 00:17:44,622
A highly placed source tells me

344
00:17:44,624 --> 00:17:46,023
there is currently broad suspicion

345
00:17:46,025 --> 00:17:48,826
that CNO Tom Chandler
is no longer in China,

346
00:17:48,828 --> 00:17:50,762
but is, in fact, onboard the Nathan James

Takehaya and the hostages.

Whether or not they're making progress,

349
00:17:54,768 --> 00:17:56,768
no one can tell us, except
the man behind that door,

350
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:57,802
which remains closed.

351

No questions have been answered today.

Where did you hear that?

355
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:05,376
So it's true.

356
00:18:05,378 --> 00:18:08,079
Judging by your reaction,
there's no good news.

357

Get him out of here.

358

One of the regional leaders.

Don't you see how
you're being manipulated?

364
00:18:28,134 --> 00:18:31,068
I think it's you and the administration
that are doing the manipulating.

365
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:34,639
- We could freeze your credentials.
- I thought we still had a free press.

366
00:18:38,578 --> 00:18:41,746
Jacob, this is a sensitive operation.

Sasha: I can't tell how
fast they're moving.

377
00:19:14,147 --> 00:19:16,547
Lucky for us, the motors are very small

378
00:19:16,549 --> 00:19:18,549
and the mines are very large,

379
00:19:18,551 --> 00:19:21,018
and we're 1/4 mile from the closest one.

380
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:24,288
Well, how soon till the
first one closes in on us?

381
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:27,458
TAO estimates approximately 44 minutes,

382
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:30,962
with the next wave
a few minutes later...

if we're still here.

384
00:19:38,037 --> 00:19:41,405
Has anyone talked
about evacuating the ship

385
00:19:41,407 --> 00:19:43,307
while we still have time?

386
00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:45,042
We canvassed the crew.

00:19:45,044 --> 00:19:47,745
No one's leaving.

388

Burk: We already lost one man. I'm
not gonna lose another. What do we do?

389
00:19:58,725 --> 00:20:00,391
Danny: I say we send
the divers out again,

390
00:20:00,393 --> 00:20:02,727
we attach C-4 charges to each
mine, we blow them up one by one.

391
00:20:02,729 --> 00:20:04,462
Cameron: That could
cause a chain reaction

392
00:20:04,464 --> 00:20:06,631
- and blow the whole minefield.
- Burk: You got a better idea?

393
00:20:06,633 --> 00:20:08,733
Put flotation gear on them. Get
them to rise to the surface,

394
00:20:08,735 --> 00:20:11,869
ship takes them out one
by one with the 50-cals.

395
00:20:11,871 --> 00:20:13,771
Not enough time.

396
00:20:13,773 --> 00:20:17,942
TAO... we still have both Nixies?

397
00:20:17,944 --> 00:20:20,344
Yes, sir. Full working order.

398
00:20:20,346 --> 00:20:22,580
How's that gonna help us?

399
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:26,117
We drag a Nixie behind
us to fool a torpedo.

400
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:28,920
What's to stop us from
having it trick the mines?

401
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:34,091
Rig the Nixie tube to
the batteries on the helo,

402
00:20:34,093 --> 00:20:35,626
crank up the sound generator,

403
00:20:35,628 --> 00:20:38,496
and tow it through the
minefield ahead of us.

404
00:20:38,498 --> 00:20:39,864
So the sound it puts out

405
00:20:39,866 --> 00:20:41,866
triggers the sonically
activated mines to blow

406
00:20:41,868 --> 00:20:43,601
and creates a path for the ship.

407
00:20:43,603 --> 00:20:46,604
And we follow the helo's
track as it clears a lane.

408
00:20:48,207 --> 00:20:49,507
How fast can you rig it?

409
00:20:49,509 --> 00:20:52,076
Less than 10, sir. I'm on it.

410
00:20:55,715 --> 00:20:58,382
Sir, I don't think Jesse's helo

411
00:20:58,384 --> 00:21:00,151
can cover enough water in
the time that we have.

412
00:21:00,153 --> 00:21:03,354
You may get a path out, but
by the time it's clear,

413
00:21:03,356 --> 00:21:05,589
the mines on our
flank are gonna take us out.

414
00:21:05,591 --> 00:21:08,693
We can rig the second
Nixie to one of the RHIBs.

415
00:21:08,695 --> 00:21:11,896
You let my team run
interference on the weak side.

416
00:21:11,898 --> 00:21:13,831
You'll be racing over
the mines as the detonate.

417

We got 100 yards of cable, sir.

418
00:21:15,335 --> 00:21:18,169
We... We put the
Nixie far enough behind us,

419
00:21:18,171 --> 00:21:19,370
it takes the blows.

420
00:21:19,372 --> 00:21:20,938

00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,470
We need to throw them a bone,

485
00:25:47,472 --> 00:25:48,938
make some kind of concession.

486
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,873
Unless the James makes
it out of that minefield.

487
00:25:50,875 --> 00:25:51,756
I'm sorry, Kara.

488
00:25:51,857 --> 00:25:53,364
I know your husband's on that ship,

489
00:25:53,365 --> 00:25:57,013
but we can not count on the
James surviving to bail us out.

490
00:25:57,015 --> 00:25:59,782
Michener: Even if they
do, there's no bailing us out.

491
00:25:59,784 --> 00:26:01,384
The leaders smell blood in the water.

492
00:26:01,386 --> 00:26:02,618
What do you want to give them?

493
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,620
Nothing, except maybe my middle finger.

494
00:26:04,622 --> 00:26:06,255
- Sir...
- Nothing, Alex.

495
00:26:06,257 --> 00:26:08,057
We give them nothing.

496
00:26:08,893 --> 00:26:10,493
CNO on the bridge.

497
00:26:10,495 --> 00:26:12,829
How far to the closest mine?

498
00:26:12,831 --> 00:26:14,464
110 yards, sir.

499
00:26:14,466 --> 00:26:16,566
8 minutes till impact.

500
00:26:16,568 --> 00:26:18,901
[Helicopter blades whirring]

501
00:26:22,173 --> 00:26:24,173
Let's go.

502
00:26:43,228 --> 00:26:45,328
Cruz: <i>Nathan James, RHIB is in position.</i>

503
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:46,274
Commence engine engagement

504
00:26:46,299 --> 00:26:47,363
- procedure.
- Alisha: Aye, sir.

505
00:26:47,365 --> 00:26:49,599
OOD, engage shafts port and starboard.

506
00:26:49,601 --> 00:26:52,134
Engage shafts port and starboard.

507
00:26:52,136 --> 00:26:54,203
Engaging.

508
00:26:56,941 --> 00:26:58,508
We have turns on port shaft.

509
00:26:58,510 --> 00:26:59,876
We have turns on starboard shaft.

510
00:26:59,878 --> 00:27:03,079
Sasha: Releasing the Nixie now.

511
00:27:07,185 --> 00:27:09,819
Chandler: OOD, ahead 2/3 knots.

512
00:27:09,821 --> 00:27:12,822
We do not want to wake up those mines.

513
00:27:12,824 --> 00:27:14,690
We stay a Quiet One.

514
00:27:14,692 --> 00:27:17,026
CCS, CIC, maintain Quiet One.

515
00:27:17,028 --> 00:27:21,264
Helm, no less than 1,000
yards from that helo.

516
00:27:21,266 --> 00:27:23,900
- Give it room to work in front of us.
- Aye, sir.

517
00:27:36,928 --> 00:27:39,162
Gator: Approaching the
first set now, sir.

518
00:27:39,164 --> 00:27:41,598
Port side.

519
00:27:42,434 --> 00:27:45,835
[Explosions]

520
00:27:58,717 --> 00:28:01,251
Five degrees starboard!

521
00:28:01,253 --> 00:28:04,053
Come to 0-2-1-2.

522
00:28:04,055 --> 00:28:07,023
The next group is right...

523
00:28:07,025 --> 00:28:09,092
Oh!

524
00:28:11,363 --> 00:28:13,263
There!

525
00:28:13,265 --> 00:28:14,697
That was close.

526
00:28:14,699 --> 00:28:16,499
Two more sets.

527
00:28:16,501 --> 00:28:18,368
[Explosions]

528
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:21,571
Cruz and Wolf, you're up.

529
00:28:21,573 --> 00:28:23,106
Port side.

530
00:28:23,108 --> 00:28:24,774
Steady now.

531
00:28:26,411 --> 00:28:30,680
Got three of them coming
right up, bearing 2-2-5.

532
00:28:37,556 --> 00:28:39,189
Chandler: Nicely done, gentlemen.

533
00:28:42,627 --> 00:28:45,128
How many was that?

534
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:46,863
I count 12.

535
00:29:01,313 --> 00:29:02,846
[Whispers]

536
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:05,248
[Inhales deeply]

537
00:29:22,734 --> 00:29:24,567
Sir, maintaining current speed,

538
00:29:24,569 --> 00:29:26,569
we'll reach the end of the minefield

539
00:29:26,571 --> 00:29:28,004
in less than four minutes.

540
00:29:28,006 --> 00:29:29,672
How we doing, Green?

541
00:29:31,209 --> 00:29:32,542
That's four!

542
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:35,011
How many left along this line?

543
00:29:35,013 --> 00:29:37,380
I count three remaining.

544
00:29:39,951 --> 00:29:42,919
There! Hold that.

545
00:29:42,921 --> 00:29:45,088
200 yards on this bearing.

546
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:48,625
By our count, we've got
three sets left, sir.

547
00:29:48,627 --> 00:29:50,193
Chandler: Copy that.

548
00:29:50,195 --> 00:29:52,662
Alpha team, 2 more sets... 100
yards off our starboard bow.

549
00:29:52,664 --> 00:29:54,530
Bearing 1-6-5.

550
00:29:54,532 --> 00:29:56,599
Got it, sir. On it. Brace, Wolf.

551
00:29:56,601 --> 00:29:58,801
We're turning.

552
00:30:03,375 --> 00:30:06,242
Alpha team, we've got the
same problem midships port side.

553
00:30:06,244 --> 00:30:08,044
Cruz: Heading to your port side.

554
00:30:08,046 --> 00:30:09,913
Permission to increase speed, sir.

555
00:30:09,915 --> 00:30:11,781
No more than 15 knots.

556
00:30:11,783 --> 00:30:13,249
We don't want your engine noise

557
00:30:13,251 --> 00:30:15,285
to set off the whole damn minefield.

558
00:30:15,287 --> 00:30:17,754
Aye aye, Captain.

559
00:30:19,791 --> 00:30:21,090
Hydrophone effects.

560
00:30:21,092 --> 00:30:23,559
I hear hydrophone effects, sir.

561
00:30:23,561 --> 00:30:25,161
Jesus.

562
00:30:28,934 --> 00:30:30,833
Captain, we've got hydrophone effects.

563
00:30:30,835 --> 00:30:32,635
Torpedo incoming. Where?

564
00:30:32,637 --> 00:30:34,203
- [Alarm blaring]
- Son of a bitch.

565
00:30:34,205 --> 00:30:35,972
Where the hell did that come from?

566
00:30:35,974 --> 00:30:37,407
Calculating vector, sir.

567
00:30:37,409 --> 00:30:38,641
All engines ahead flank!

568
00:30:38,643 --> 00:30:41,144
Sonar, radar, find me a contact.

569
00:30:41,146 --> 00:30:44,113
There's a ship out there somewhere.

570
00:30:44,115 --> 00:30:48,351
Wolf, Cruz, be advised torpedo incoming.

571
00:30:48,353 --> 00:30:51,821
Inbound. 7 miles out, doing... 60 knots.

572
00:30:54,392 --> 00:30:56,225
[Explosion]

573
00:30:57,929 --> 00:31:00,296
Danny: We have not
swept all the mines, sir!

574
00:31:00,298 --> 00:31:04,167
You are not clear to overtake us!

575
00:31:04,169 --> 00:31:06,369
Sir, no room to evade port or starboard.

576
00:31:06,371 --> 00:31:08,504
Sir, torpedo appears to be a VA-111

577
00:31:08,506 --> 00:31:11,407
big enough to blow the
entire minefield around us.

578
00:31:11,409 --> 00:31:14,544
TAO, what's the bearing on that torpedo?

579
00:31:14,546 --> 00:31:18,247
Bearing 2-4-0 to the
ship... 2-4-5 to you.

580
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:23,353
You got that?

581
00:31:23,355 --> 00:31:25,488
I got it.

00:31:27,826 --> 00:31:29,192
[Alarm blaring]

583
00:31:29,194 --> 00:31:31,260
What are they doing?

584
00:31:33,999 --> 00:31:37,100
They're going for the torpedo.

585
00:31:37,102 --> 00:31:39,535
Danny: Holy shit. They're
trying to intercept it.

586
00:31:39,537 --> 00:31:41,137
Can that work?

587
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,008
If they don't intercept far enough out,

588
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:47,176
the shock waves will
set all the mines off

589
00:31:47,178 --> 00:31:48,478
and kill everyone anyway.

590
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,214
Wolf, let out as much line as you can.

591
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:55,818
Captain, 15 knots will
not allow us to intercept.

592
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,387
Sir, the Nixie needs to hit that torpedo

593
00:31:57,389 --> 00:31:58,988
beyond the edge of the minefield.

594
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:01,324
- Gun it, Cruz.
- Cruz: Copy that, sir.

Those mines are gonna be exploding

right under our bow if
we get any closer to you.

pull the Nixie out of the water.

650
00:38:09,831 --> 00:38:11,264
[Laughs]

651
00:38:11,266 --> 00:38:12,932
[Cheers]

652
00:38:12,934 --> 00:38:14,367
All right!

653
00:38:14,369 --> 00:38:19,973
[Cheers and applause]

654
00:38:27,482 --> 00:38:31,484
- Yes!
- Coming home to Mother.

655
00:38:48,069 --> 00:38:50,637
- Watch yourself.
- Got him.

656
00:38:56,778 --> 00:39:00,680
[Chatter]

657
00:39:02,284 --> 00:39:04,751
Sir, we have word from Nathan James.

658
00:39:04,753 --> 00:39:07,954
They made it out of the minefield.

659
00:39:07,956 --> 00:39:10,156
They think they're
closing in on Takehaya.

660
00:39:10,158 --> 00:39:11,524
Well...

661
00:39:11,526 --> 00:39:15,562
we live to fight another day.

662
00:39:17,365 --> 00:39:19,966
[Sighs]

663
00:39:26,942 --> 00:39:31,044
Make yourself at home.

664
00:39:34,816 --> 00:39:37,684
You've got a soft spot for him.

665
00:39:39,921 --> 00:39:42,288
Green.

666
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:44,557
He's my best operator.

667
00:39:46,394 --> 00:39:49,429
I wanted you protected...

668
00:39:49,431 --> 00:39:51,798
if it went to hell.

669
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:55,001
So you've got a soft spot for me?

670
00:39:55,003 --> 00:39:58,471
That's never been much of a secret.

671
00:40:04,045 --> 00:40:09,015
I've always run
things as a solo operation.

672
00:40:11,019 --> 00:40:15,455
Must be such a burden, having
to make all those decisions...

673
00:40:15,457 --> 00:40:18,057
everyone's lives in your hands.

674
00:40:18,059 --> 00:40:21,694
It's the job.

675
00:40:23,932 --> 00:40:28,801
Well... you do it with grace.

676
00:40:34,509 --> 00:40:39,112
[Sighs]

677
00:40:50,759 --> 00:40:54,994
I really did not want to lose you today.

678
00:40:59,567 --> 00:41:02,402
[Door opens]

679
00:41:13,581 --> 00:41:17,356
Chandler: I'm gonna get there, Mike.

680
00:41:19,923 --> 00:41:24,688
