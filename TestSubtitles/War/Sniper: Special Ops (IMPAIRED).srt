REPORTER: ...turmoil since
the Arab uprisings of 2011...

00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,620
As armored military vehicles
took to the streets of Kabul

00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:57,189
in an effort to calm...

Even though the Middle East
is fractured by...

Burning U.S. flags continues
as unrest in Afghanistan...

And the other part is
under full Israeli control.

this is Apache Renegade,

00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:17,509
nearing extraction point 3.0.

How copy?

10
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:21,279
Apache Renegade,
this is Beeline. All copy.

11

APACHE: Beeline, Team Dogbite
is on the ground.

00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:28,920
Repeat, Team Dogbite is on
the ground, outside Matubahk.

13
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,456
Returning to outpost Renegade.

00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,992
BEELINE: Copy that, Apache.
Good luck.

Nope.

I'll be damned.

This was Johnny Longbow's.

A rabbit's foot?

31
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,140
Can't hurt.

No, thanks.
I'm trying to quit.

We're at Zulu, up high.

We're ready to check Bravo.

Heading topside.

Overwatch, Two is at Charlie.

44
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:48,440
Anything in my area?

45
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:52,677
That's a negative.
Quiet as a mouse.

46
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,251
Hey, Vic.

47
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,088
Yeah, Jake.

I've been thinking about
that 50 bucks I owe you.

Hey, don't even.

And it's 60 bucks.

How about if we
knock off five dollars

for every time
I save your ass today?

Tell you what.
How 'bout we double-down

00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,475
if I get your butt
out of here in one piece?

55
00:07:23,477 --> 00:07:24,943
No deal.

56
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:30,515
Where does an entire personal
security detail disappear to?

57
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:33,384
That's the same thing
I was thinking, man.

I really don't know.

Your guess is as good as mine.

Just keep your eyes open,
head on a swivel.

some blood trails,
nothing else.

Dogbite, Beeline.
Solid copy. Send it.

Beeline, Beeline,
Dogbite is at Delta.

I say again,
Dogbite is at Delta.

73
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:05,777
We have the personal
security detail all down hard.

No joy on the package.

I say again,
no joy on the package.

Last chance is Echo.

then we gotta get
out of here ASAP.

a piss-poor option.

I say again,
piss-poor option.

Can we get a bird?

When you enter the ville,
bypass Foxtrot 3.

167
00:15:17,934 --> 00:15:20,534
Head directly
to the city square.

168
00:15:20,536 --> 00:15:21,668
I say again, city square.

169
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,171
We're on the southwest corner.

170
00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:29,810
And, gents, give us as much
firepower as you got

171
00:15:29,812 --> 00:15:31,746
so we can get this package
on the vic.

172
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:35,682
Over there!

173
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:37,551
Break, break!

174
00:15:39,321 --> 00:15:40,587
Overwatch, Overwatch!

175
00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:41,922
Join us ASAP

176
00:15:41,924 --> 00:15:44,591
as soon as you have eyes
on the vics inbound.

177
00:15:47,263 --> 00:15:48,829
Moving now.

178
00:16:01,911 --> 00:16:04,078
Overwatch, watch my right!

179
00:16:07,516 --> 00:16:10,117
Come on, pick it up!

180
00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:11,185
Come on!

181
00:16:12,755 --> 00:16:14,989
Put your hand on my shoulder
and don't let go.

182
00:16:19,996 --> 00:16:23,097
Get him in there!
Get him in there!

183
00:16:26,769 --> 00:16:29,203
- Secure the package!
- In here!

184
00:16:29,205 --> 00:16:31,238
[Screams]

185
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,507
Come on, buddy!

186
00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:34,775
Get him in!

187
00:16:36,179 --> 00:16:39,346
Vic, we can't hold
this position any longer.

188
00:16:39,348 --> 00:16:42,582
Don't you move!
Don't you dare move!

189
00:16:54,831 --> 00:16:56,197
Vic, we gotta go.

190
00:16:56,199 --> 00:16:59,099
Jake, where are you guys?
We gotta move!

191
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,307
Come on, boy, let's go.

192
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:18,552
Vic, the orders are clear!
You're risking everything now!

193
00:17:19,421 --> 00:17:20,888
Shit!

194
00:17:26,595 --> 00:17:28,195
Get out of here!

195
00:17:29,398 --> 00:17:30,865
Go!

196
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,570
Come on.

197
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:50,617
- Do you know your name?
- Cooper.

198
00:17:50,619 --> 00:17:52,186
Cooper? Congressman Cooper,

199
00:17:52,188 --> 00:17:53,820
I'm Sergeant Richter
of the U.S. Army.

200
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,622
We're taking you back to base,
all right?

201
00:17:58,627 --> 00:17:59,894
Let me have that thing.

202
00:17:59,896 --> 00:18:01,362
Keep it up. Come here.

203
00:18:01,364 --> 00:18:05,299
You're gonna be okay.
All right.

204
00:18:05,301 --> 00:18:07,234
Where are you?
Open another field dressing.

205
00:18:07,236 --> 00:18:09,636
Give me one more pack.
Hurry up.

206
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,841
How you doing, buddy?

207
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,510
We should go back.

208
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:19,380
We can't. Getting
the congressman to safety

209
00:18:19,382 --> 00:18:20,915
is our number one priority.

210
00:18:20,917 --> 00:18:23,384
I know what our number one
priority is.

211
00:18:23,386 --> 00:18:24,919
Okay.

212
00:18:24,921 --> 00:18:27,687
I'm just saying
I'd like to go back.

213
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:31,158
And we will, Vic,
as soon as we can.

214
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,060
Hang in there, buddy.
Hang in there.

215
00:18:33,062 --> 00:18:35,595
I gotta keep pressure, okay?
You all right?

216
00:18:35,597 --> 00:18:36,897
Step on it, Charlie!

217
00:18:36,899 --> 00:18:38,332
I'm crushing it, Vic.

218
00:18:56,402 --> 00:18:58,135
I'd like to be more helpful,
Miss Conrad,

219
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,404
but your timing's off.
Maybe in a couple of days.

220
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:02,072
I can't believe this.

221
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:05,376
You're deliberately
hamstringing me, Colonel. Why?

222
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:07,744
Nobody is
hamstringing anybody.

223
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:10,548
It's simply not safe
outside the wire right now.

224
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:13,050
That's ridiculous.
This is a war zone.

225
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:15,052
It's never going to be safe.

226
00:19:15,054 --> 00:19:18,855
Look, you may have finagled your
way onto this combat outpost,

227
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:21,425
and you may be
Admiral Willet's niece,

228
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:25,028
but none of that buys you
a ride outside this wire.

229
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,797
It's just too damn dangerous.

230
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,566
I'll have you know
I was embedded

231
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:30,167
with Cheyenne at Obamadad.

232
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,769
Yeah, and three soldiers
were killed on that ride-along.

233
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:35,272
Ah, so you're saying I'm some
kind of jinx, is that it?

234
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:37,074
You're saying I got
those men killed?

235
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:38,442
I'm not saying anything
of the kind.

236
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:39,643
Here's what I am saying.

237
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:41,645
You are not going
outside my wire.

238
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:42,879
End of discussion.

239
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:46,317
I see. So you are
hamstringing me.

240
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:53,724
Let's go, men!

241
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:55,192
Oh, shit. What's that?

242
00:19:58,097 --> 00:20:00,531
Move it! Move it!
Let's go!

243
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:01,865
Medics on the way!

244
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,167
Let's go!
Get him out, get him out!

245
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:06,903
Okay.

246
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,908
Hey, get the congressman down
to the colonel now, ASAP.

247
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,712
Trevor, close that gate,
damn it!

248
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:15,979
Secure it!

249
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:19,450
Medic's here, buddy.

250
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:20,984
No, Charlie, I can walk.

251
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:22,386
Don't need no medic.

252
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:24,187
We can get you inside,
get you all patched up.

253
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:27,057
No, I can walk.
Let me walk. Vic!

254
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,859
I'm sorry, buddy.
It has to be this way.

255
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:29,993
Get him on the stretcher now!

256
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:32,663
- You! Get over here!
- Hey!

257
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:35,332
Come on.
One, two, three.

258
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:36,833
[Grunts]

259
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:42,806
- Charlie, you got him?
- I got him. Grab him.

260
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:45,276
One, two, three, go!
Let's go, move.

261
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:53,584
I don't know who you are
or what you want,

262
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,018
but stay away from my men.

263
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,520
And who authorized you
to take photos?

264
00:20:56,522 --> 00:20:57,921
Easy, cowboy.

265
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,090
Stay away from my men.
Do you understand me?

266
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:03,059
NATO correspondent,
so just cool down, okay?

267
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:08,031
Hey, you can't do that.

268
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:14,405
Give that back to me.
Give that--

269
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:15,806
- Charlie, keep her out.
- Yes, sir.

270
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:18,275
- Oh, my God.
- No, no, no.

271
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:22,179
Excuse me, Sergeant,
is that Congressman Cooper?

272
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:23,847
Ma'am, please, just stand back.

273
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:25,015
Is that Congressman
Stan Cooper?

274
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:26,417
Ma'am, please step aside.

275
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:30,187
What is he doing in there?
Is he wounded?

276
00:21:30,189 --> 00:21:31,188
Damn it!

277
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:58,382
It was just a bright flash
of light right in my eyes.

278
00:21:58,384 --> 00:22:00,484
It must have ricocheted
off the Humvee.

279
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:03,119
[Groans]
My face feels like it's on fire!

280
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:05,522
I know, Marcus.
Let Shipley take a look.

281
00:22:07,393 --> 00:22:09,526
[Groans]

282
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:11,094
Well?

283
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:15,799
I can see shapes.
It's all blurry.

284
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:17,401
Marcus, listen to me, buddy.

285
00:22:17,403 --> 00:22:19,903
Stop talking and let Shipley
take care of your wounds.

286
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:24,107
Just sit back and relax, okay?
We'll be back to check on you.

287
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:25,743
- Let's go.
- Hey, Vic.

288
00:22:25,745 --> 00:22:27,143
Yeah.

289
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:29,913
Thanks for dragging me
into that Humvee.

290
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:31,915
If I had just been
a little bit faster.

291
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:35,118
Yeah, forget it.
It's what we do, right?

292
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,888
We watch each other's six.

293
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:42,693
May I have a word with you?

294
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:44,995
V? You know what we gotta do.

295
00:22:44,997 --> 00:22:47,765
Go get the gear prepped.
Stand by.

296
00:22:47,767 --> 00:22:50,534
Roger that.

297
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:51,902
What do you want?

298
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,804
I know we got off
on the wrong foot.

299
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:55,472
I'd really like to fix that.

300
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:57,374
You know I got a job to do.
So do you.

301
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,142
Sometimes I can be
a little pushy

302
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:01,845
'cause I'm one of those people
no one ever wants around.

303
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:04,147
If I don't push, I don't get.

304
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:05,883
Makes me pretty unpopular.

305
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:07,484
So I'm sorry.

306
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:09,653
Fair enough.

307
00:23:09,655 --> 00:23:12,355
Janet Conrad.

308
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:15,225
That Janet Conrad?

309
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,895
What's that supposed to mean?

310
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,396
I think maybe I heard of you.

311
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,298
Don't start with
this jinx nonsense.

312
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,300
Imbedded in Portacurdey.

313
00:23:23,302 --> 00:23:25,201
- Obamadad.
- Have a nice day.

314
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:27,070
Was that Congressman Cooper
you just brought in?

315
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,505
I don't know who
you're talking about.

316
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:30,373
Of course you do.
Congressman Stanford Cooper.

317
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:33,376
He's one of the most vocal
opponents of military spending.

318
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:36,212
He'd shut this whole operation
down if he could.

319
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:38,081
Cut your paycheck,
cancel your vacation,

320
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,516
shoot your dog,

321
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:41,318
yet here he is.

322
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,320
Why?

323
00:23:43,322 --> 00:23:45,856
Sure sounds like you know
a lot more than I do.

324
00:23:45,858 --> 00:23:49,693
What's he doing here?
Why are you being so evasive?

325
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:52,162
I have a debrief to attend.

326
00:24:03,092 --> 00:24:05,658
We didn't make it out, huh?

327
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:06,993
No.

328
00:24:10,332 --> 00:24:12,599
What about the others?

329
00:24:12,601 --> 00:24:15,401
Some did,
some are lying out there.

330
00:24:17,973 --> 00:24:21,742
Thanks for not
leaving me behind.

331
00:24:21,744 --> 00:24:24,477
Don't mention it, brother.

332
00:24:27,783 --> 00:24:29,582
Jake?

333
00:24:29,584 --> 00:24:31,184
Yeah.

334
00:24:33,122 --> 00:24:36,790
I can't move my legs.

335
00:24:36,792 --> 00:24:38,424
I'm trying, but...

336
00:24:39,795 --> 00:24:42,062
I can't feel anything.

337
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:45,098
You got a round
lodged in your spine.

338
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,667
I stopped the bleeding, but...

339
00:24:47,669 --> 00:24:49,836
there's really not much more
I could do for now.

340
00:24:49,838 --> 00:24:54,941
We gonna have to wait
until some folks get here.

341
00:24:54,943 --> 00:24:57,577
When will that be?

342
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:00,280
Soon, I hope, man.
Our 119 is shot.

343
00:25:02,484 --> 00:25:04,617
Can't fix this damn thing.

344
00:25:04,619 --> 00:25:08,521
Probably we're gonna have
to just wait it out.

345
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,194
And you checked the bodies?

346
00:25:14,196 --> 00:25:16,562
Yes, sir. All of 'em.

347
00:25:16,564 --> 00:25:19,465
Full of bullet holes.
Some of 'em cut up.

348
00:25:19,467 --> 00:25:22,635
Bodies were all stripped clean
of body armor and weapons.

349
00:25:22,637 --> 00:25:25,238
They had the bodies stacked up
in that little shop

350
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,607
across the street
from the hotel.

351
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:30,877
Looks to me like it was a real
intense, close-quarter battle.

352
00:25:30,879 --> 00:25:32,312
They lost.

353
00:25:32,314 --> 00:25:33,680
Then we headed
over to the hotel.

354
00:25:33,682 --> 00:25:35,415
They had the congressman
strung up there

355
00:25:35,417 --> 00:25:38,518
like a damn worm on a hook,
and we took the bait.

356
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,053
Then what?

357
00:25:40,055 --> 00:25:41,621
Request to speak freely.

358
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:43,190
Shoot.

359
00:25:43,192 --> 00:25:47,360
How in the hell does
a non-military observer

360
00:25:47,362 --> 00:25:49,095
like the congressman

361
00:25:49,097 --> 00:25:54,600
get authorization to go on some
sightseeing tour in Matubahk

362
00:25:54,602 --> 00:25:57,904
and then fall into a damn ambush
that is so perfectly laid out

363
00:25:57,906 --> 00:26:01,141
that not one of the team members
of the personal security detail

364
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:02,976
survives or radios for help?

365
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,477
Don't smell right, sir.

366
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:06,546
I don't have a good answer
for you, Sergeant Mosby.

367
00:26:06,548 --> 00:26:08,882
What about the congressman?
Why was he spared?

368
00:26:08,884 --> 00:26:10,450
Who the hell knows?

369
00:26:10,452 --> 00:26:12,185
Maybe they were
planning to stage

370
00:26:12,187 --> 00:26:13,753
some Internet extravaganza
with him

371
00:26:13,755 --> 00:26:15,421
or trade him
for something they want.

372
00:26:15,423 --> 00:26:16,823
Hell, they only
had him for a day.

373
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,225
Maybe they didn't
have any plan at all.

374
00:26:18,227 --> 00:26:20,493
Maybe.

375
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:24,097
All right, sir, look,
as far Chandler and Cannon go--

376
00:26:24,099 --> 00:26:27,834
If you're talking about going
back into Matubahk today,

377
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:28,969
negative.

378
00:26:28,971 --> 00:26:31,604
Why? Those are my men, sir.

379
00:26:31,606 --> 00:26:35,508
Because I'm short of people
and ammunition.

380
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,410
Here's the deal, Mosby.

381
00:26:37,412 --> 00:26:39,445
Renegade got hit hard
last night,

382
00:26:39,447 --> 00:26:41,114
and they're still
under pressure.

383
00:26:41,116 --> 00:26:44,050
All available air assets have
been committed to that fight.

384
00:26:44,052 --> 00:26:46,486
In the meantime, I get word
a major Taliban force

385
00:26:46,488 --> 00:26:48,355
is headed in our direction.

386
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:50,790
If that's the case,
I don't have the people,

387
00:26:50,792 --> 00:26:53,426
and I don't have the ammo
to stage an effective defense.

388
00:26:53,428 --> 00:26:56,696
So I am not authorizing
anything outside the wire

389
00:26:56,698 --> 00:27:00,166
until we get resupplied
and reinforced.

390
00:27:00,168 --> 00:27:01,534
Now go see about your men.

391
00:27:07,242 --> 00:27:09,943
All right, when do we go?

392
00:27:09,945 --> 00:27:12,812
- We don't.
- What?

393
00:27:12,814 --> 00:27:15,215
Colonel says we wait.

394
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:16,616
That doesn't make any sense.

395
00:27:16,618 --> 00:27:19,719
I know.
He's got his reasons.

396
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,521
I'm just not sure I'm buying.

397
00:27:21,523 --> 00:27:23,423
What are you gonna do?

398
00:27:23,425 --> 00:27:26,726
I'm gonna go ask
some questions.

399
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:29,396
You stand by.
Be ready to move.

400
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:40,407
Marcus.

401
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:42,442
You awake, buddy?

402
00:27:42,444 --> 00:27:45,678
Hey, Vic.
Yeah, I'm awake, all right.

403
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,880
They just gave me
a shot of the good stuff,

404
00:27:47,882 --> 00:27:49,749
so it won't be long.

405
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:51,484
That's good, buddy.
That's good.

406
00:27:51,486 --> 00:27:52,986
You need your rest.

407
00:27:52,988 --> 00:27:56,122
Well, I'm sorry about
Doc and the guys.

408
00:27:56,124 --> 00:27:58,825
Yeah, yeah, we all are.

409
00:27:58,827 --> 00:28:03,629
I guess compared to them,
I'm the lucky one.

410
00:28:05,834 --> 00:28:10,370
I want you to have this.
Maybe it'll do you some good.

411
00:28:10,372 --> 00:28:13,873
Besides, I heard
there's a jinx in the camp.

412
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:18,744
News travels fast, huh?

413
00:28:18,746 --> 00:28:21,647
You, uh, sure
you can spare this?

414
00:28:21,649 --> 00:28:22,449
[Chuckles]

415
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:24,750
Yeah, I'm sure.

416
00:28:24,752 --> 00:28:26,987
As long as you have it on you,
you'll be okay.

417
00:28:26,989 --> 00:28:28,388
All right, buddy.

418
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:30,457
I'll take real good care
of it, all right?

419
00:28:32,927 --> 00:28:36,496
[Groaning]

420
00:28:42,871 --> 00:28:45,505
[moans]

421
00:28:48,543 --> 00:28:49,642
- Congressman?
- [Screams]

422
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:51,644
It's okay, it's okay.

423
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:53,079
You're safe, you're safe.

424
00:28:53,081 --> 00:28:55,581
I'm Sergeant First Class Mosby.

425
00:28:55,583 --> 00:28:57,617
I was leading the rescue team
this morning, sir.

426
00:28:57,619 --> 00:28:59,519
It's okay, it's okay.

427
00:28:59,521 --> 00:29:00,920
Relax, relax.

428
00:29:00,922 --> 00:29:03,289
Congressman.

429
00:29:03,291 --> 00:29:04,690
- Sir.
- Hmm?

430
00:29:04,692 --> 00:29:07,160
I need to know
what happened in Matubahk.

431
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:12,399
Sir, was it an ambush
or was it something else, sir?

432
00:29:12,401 --> 00:29:14,467
Congressman?

433
00:29:14,469 --> 00:29:16,503
You're not gonna get anything
out of him, Vic.

434
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:19,172
He's been on the hard stuff
for a while.

435
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,640
Ah, damn it.

436
00:29:20,642 --> 00:29:25,778
Yeah. I heard him talking
before he passed out.

437
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:28,448
He was rambling.

438
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:31,651
What'd you hear him say?

439
00:29:31,653 --> 00:29:36,822
He said a name
two, three times.

440
00:29:36,824 --> 00:29:38,258
I don't...

441
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:42,929
Ab-- Abdul Abbat...

442
00:29:42,931 --> 00:29:43,996
Abdul Azim Abad?

443
00:30:06,088 --> 00:30:07,687
Sergeant.

444
00:30:07,689 --> 00:30:10,389
How's your friend?

445
00:30:12,995 --> 00:30:15,795
[Sighs]

446
00:30:15,797 --> 00:30:18,164
Ma'am?

447
00:30:18,166 --> 00:30:21,334
You keep doggin' me. Why?

448
00:30:21,336 --> 00:30:23,803
Hey, I thought
we were friends now.

449
00:30:23,805 --> 00:30:26,006
Besides, you're the most
interesting soldier I've met

450
00:30:26,008 --> 00:30:27,140
so far.

451
00:30:27,142 --> 00:30:29,776
Well, you must not be
looking too hard.

452
00:30:29,778 --> 00:30:31,477
Let's call a truce.

453
00:30:31,479 --> 00:30:33,847
I'm sure we can find a happy
balance, don't you think?

454
00:30:33,849 --> 00:30:35,949
You haven't even
gotten to know me yet.

455
00:30:35,951 --> 00:30:37,083
[Chuckles]

456
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:40,120
Oh, I think I know you
pretty well.

457
00:30:40,122 --> 00:30:43,222
Let's see.

458
00:30:43,224 --> 00:30:45,025
Spoiled little rich girl.

459
00:30:45,027 --> 00:30:48,695
Probably went to Harvard,
Yale, Princeton.

460
00:30:48,697 --> 00:30:50,596
Mount Saint Agnes.

461
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:52,799
Oh, Mount Saint Agnes. Close.

462
00:30:52,801 --> 00:30:55,001
Uh, you got some heavy hitters
in your background.

463
00:30:55,003 --> 00:30:57,403
The kind of folks
that can push along

464
00:30:57,405 --> 00:30:58,772
your little career in NATO

465
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:02,375
to get you exactly where
you want to be fast.

466
00:31:02,377 --> 00:31:05,845
I'm guessing you're probably
somebody's daughter,

467
00:31:05,847 --> 00:31:07,080
granddaughter...

468
00:31:07,082 --> 00:31:08,114
Niece.

469
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,448
Niece!

470
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:10,583
Admiral Willett's.

471
00:31:10,585 --> 00:31:11,851
Oh, even better.

472
00:31:11,853 --> 00:31:14,620
That's outstanding.
Admiral.

473
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:16,622
Well, the admiral must not
be too fond of you

474
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:18,124
if he sent you here.

475
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:21,627
You kidding me?
I begged for this assignment.

476
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:24,197
But your colonel
keeps smothering me.

477
00:31:24,199 --> 00:31:25,899
Now it wouldn't do for
the lieutenant colonel

478
00:31:25,901 --> 00:31:28,735
to allow you to get your ass
shot up on his watch.

479
00:31:28,737 --> 00:31:30,269
Can you blame him?

480
00:31:30,271 --> 00:31:32,271
Well, no, but I didn't fly
all the way out here

481
00:31:32,273 --> 00:31:34,708
just to photograph some
soldiers washing their skivvies

482
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:36,509
and playing horseshoes.

483
00:31:36,511 --> 00:31:37,744
Hmm.

484
00:31:37,746 --> 00:31:41,681
I have to ride along
on a mission.

485
00:31:41,683 --> 00:31:44,150
I see. I feel your pain.

486
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:47,120
But that is not my call.

487
00:31:47,122 --> 00:31:50,824
Now, ma'am,
if you will excuse me,

488
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:53,659
I've got some skivvies to wash.

489
00:31:56,531 --> 00:32:00,700
[Distant dog barking]

490
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:22,989
It's funny.

491
00:32:22,991 --> 00:32:26,826
My girl back home
is always ragging on me.

492
00:32:26,828 --> 00:32:32,031
Stress of all this makes her
kind of crazy, you know?

493
00:32:34,903 --> 00:32:41,107
So yesterday
I get this letter from her.

494
00:32:41,109 --> 00:32:44,577
Not a phone call,
just an old-fashioned letter.

495
00:32:46,748 --> 00:32:49,615
Says she found someone new.

496
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:54,620
Someone who could
be there for her.

497
00:32:57,192 --> 00:33:00,927
Someone who wasn't
halfway around the world.

498
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:04,730
Didn't think this day
could get any worse,

499
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:07,100
and then this happens.
[Laughs]

500
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:12,939
I mean,
what are the chances, right?

501
00:33:12,941 --> 00:33:16,442
Listen, man, you're gonna get
a Silver Star out of this

502
00:33:16,444 --> 00:33:17,944
when it's all over,

503
00:33:17,946 --> 00:33:21,347
and you'll have all
the girlfriends you want.

504
00:33:21,349 --> 00:33:22,648
Yeah, right.

505
00:33:27,522 --> 00:33:30,423
Sergeant,
Jackson wants to see you.

506
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:34,127
- He send you to look for me?
- That's the memo.

507
00:33:34,129 --> 00:33:35,628
Damn.

508
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,096
Stand by.

509
00:33:41,336 --> 00:33:43,669
Never waste a good cigar.

510
00:33:50,245 --> 00:33:51,911
Colonel.

511
00:33:51,913 --> 00:33:55,281
Gents, we got an update on
what happened to our resupply.

512
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:57,951
This is Bashir.
He's a terp from Renegade.

513
00:33:57,953 --> 00:34:00,220
Seems Bashir and a specialist
by the name of Tyler

514
00:34:00,222 --> 00:34:02,288
were on one
of the supply trucks.

515
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:06,226
Escort hits an IED ambush
followed by a ground attack.

516
00:34:06,228 --> 00:34:09,362
Bashir and Tyler take off
cross-country in the truck.

517
00:34:09,364 --> 00:34:11,697
They reach a point
about eight clicks from here.

518
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:14,500
Truck breaks down.
Bashir dismounted,

519
00:34:14,502 --> 00:34:16,870
walked the rest of the way in
to bring us the information.

520
00:34:16,872 --> 00:34:19,005
What's the current status?

521
00:34:19,007 --> 00:34:20,940
Well, Specialist Tyler
seems to think

522
00:34:20,942 --> 00:34:23,109
that it's a relatively
minor mechanical problem,

523
00:34:23,111 --> 00:34:26,279
something like
a broken fuel line.

524
00:34:26,281 --> 00:34:28,748
He's standing security there,
but he can't call for help.

525
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:30,716
No radio in the truck.

526
00:34:30,718 --> 00:34:32,952
Well, QRF from Renegade
should be handling that.

527
00:34:32,954 --> 00:34:36,389
Yeah, and maybe they haul
his truck back to Renegade.

528
00:34:36,391 --> 00:34:39,625
We need that fuel and ammo
more than they do right now.

529
00:34:39,627 --> 00:34:40,960
So I want you to get out there,

530
00:34:40,962 --> 00:34:43,796
find that truck,
help Tyler get it fixed

531
00:34:43,798 --> 00:34:46,032
and roll it back here.

532
00:34:46,034 --> 00:34:48,467
Take Vasquez, take Jennings.

533
00:34:48,469 --> 00:34:49,735
Bashir will show you the way.

534
00:34:49,737 --> 00:34:51,371
Any questions?

535
00:34:51,373 --> 00:34:53,873
- I got one, sir.
- Yeah?

536
00:34:53,875 --> 00:34:57,377
What about Abdul Azim Abad?

537
00:34:57,379 --> 00:34:58,811
What about him?

538
00:34:58,813 --> 00:35:00,613
He's on our top ten
hit list of bad guys,

539
00:35:00,615 --> 00:35:03,249
and he's operating in that AO.

540
00:35:03,251 --> 00:35:04,984
How do you know that?

541
00:35:04,986 --> 00:35:06,953
Folks talk in their sleep, sir.

542
00:35:06,955 --> 00:35:09,555
Look, you might as well know.

543
00:35:09,557 --> 00:35:13,426
When Congressman Cooper came
up here, he had an agenda.

544
00:35:13,428 --> 00:35:15,361
The whole idea was to prove
that all our efforts

545
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:17,696
are just a big waste
of time and money.

546
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:20,967
He insisted on visiting an
isolated or abandoned village,

547
00:35:20,969 --> 00:35:22,868
and we only had
one of those in our AO.

548
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,237
- Matubahk.
- Yeah.

549
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:26,605
Now you get out there
and find that truck.

550
00:35:26,607 --> 00:35:27,873
Yes, sir.

551
00:35:29,644 --> 00:35:30,743
Vic.

552
00:35:30,745 --> 00:35:33,212
JR?

553
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:35,448
If you can't get
that truck rolling,

554
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:38,818
pull what cargo you can
and blow the rest in place.

555
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:41,020
We got very little time
and a lot to do.

556
00:35:41,022 --> 00:35:44,324
Roger that, sir.
Let's go, guys.

557
00:35:57,138 --> 00:35:59,805
Jake?

558
00:35:59,807 --> 00:36:01,941
I'm burning up, man.

559
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,179
I know.

560
00:36:10,285 --> 00:36:12,051
Listen, I gotta go.

561
00:36:12,053 --> 00:36:15,288
You're not leaving me, are you?

562
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:18,824
No. I'm going to get
Doc's med pack and some water.

563
00:36:23,198 --> 00:36:27,900
Use this. Just don't
shoot the wrong guys.

564
00:36:29,537 --> 00:36:31,637
Roger that.

565
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:33,239
All right.

566
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:59,098
I'll just wait right here.
[Chuckles]

567
00:37:11,279 --> 00:37:13,279
I haven't been out this way
in almost a year.

568
00:37:13,281 --> 00:37:15,915
Looks like a great place
for an ambush.

569
00:37:15,917 --> 00:37:18,251
Hardly anybody
uses it anymore.

570
00:37:18,253 --> 00:37:20,319
It turns into a dirt road
just up ahead.

571
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:24,323
Let's just try not to hit any
IEDs while we're out here, huh?

572
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:26,058
Yeah, you got it.

573
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,234
- I don't like it.
- How's that?

574
00:37:35,236 --> 00:37:39,372
Convoy gets hit
by a IED ambush,

575
00:37:39,374 --> 00:37:43,075
and the one vehicle
that has all the munitions

576
00:37:43,077 --> 00:37:44,810
and supplies that we need

577
00:37:44,812 --> 00:37:47,079
goes all Evel Knievel
and escapes,

578
00:37:47,081 --> 00:37:49,315
but breaks down
before it can get to us.

579
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:59,358
You think maybe
this is a setup?

580
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,794
I don't know, V.

581
00:38:01,796 --> 00:38:03,996
Maybe.

582
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:09,969
Hey, look.

583
00:38:13,308 --> 00:38:16,742
I don't see our boy Tyler yet,
so don't get too close.

584
00:38:16,744 --> 00:38:18,077
Go ahead, stop.

585
00:38:43,838 --> 00:38:45,137
Bashir.

586
00:38:45,139 --> 00:38:47,506
You know Specialist Tyler,
right?

587
00:38:47,508 --> 00:38:49,208
Yes, Sergeant.

588
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:52,044
Go ahead and walk on out there
and call his name.

589
00:38:52,046 --> 00:38:53,879
Excuse me?

590
00:38:53,881 --> 00:38:56,849
About halfway
between here and there.

591
00:38:56,851 --> 00:38:58,384
We'll cover you.

592
00:38:58,386 --> 00:38:59,918
As you wish.

593
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,120
Go on.

594
00:39:10,331 --> 00:39:12,931
Be ready, boys.

595
00:39:27,681 --> 00:39:29,948
He seems awfully jumpy.

596
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:32,151
I might be too.

597
00:39:32,153 --> 00:39:35,021
Yeah. Point taken.

598
00:39:55,376 --> 00:39:56,409
Mr. Tyler?

599
00:39:59,414 --> 00:40:02,381
- [Camera clicking]
- Huh?

600
00:40:05,053 --> 00:40:06,519
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

601
00:40:06,521 --> 00:40:08,287
This is perfect.

602
00:40:08,289 --> 00:40:10,056
Get back in the truck.

603
00:40:10,058 --> 00:40:13,325
This is what I came here for.
Don't you try to stop me now.

604
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:16,762
I'll wring your scrawny
little neck.

605
00:40:16,764 --> 00:40:19,165
Sounds like fun, but I don't
think my uncle would like it.

606
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:20,466
Stay behind me.

607
00:40:20,468 --> 00:40:23,702
Mr. Tyler, are you still here?

608
00:40:23,704 --> 00:40:26,238
MAN: Freeze right where you are!

609
00:40:28,943 --> 00:40:31,009
Hands behind your head!

610
00:40:32,046 --> 00:40:35,414
It's me, Bashir.
I brought help.

611
00:40:37,318 --> 00:40:40,052
Hey, Bashir, buddy.

612
00:40:41,456 --> 00:40:43,855
I didn't know who it was
at first. Sorry, man.

613
00:40:43,857 --> 00:40:46,325
I was kind of a sitting duck
out here right now, you know?

614
00:40:46,327 --> 00:40:49,228
I understand completely.

615
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:50,729
All right,
let's get on with this.

616
00:40:53,601 --> 00:40:56,969
Brother, am I glad
to see you boys.

617
00:40:56,971 --> 00:40:59,738
Need a hand, Specialist Tyler?

618
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,107
Need a fuel line.

619
00:41:01,109 --> 00:41:02,608
What makes you think
it's a fuel line?

620
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:04,876
Well, I'm out of gas,
and I shouldn't be.

621
00:41:04,878 --> 00:41:06,979
Might be a hole in the tank,
but I didn't see one.

622
00:41:06,981 --> 00:41:08,614
She turns over okay?

623
00:41:08,616 --> 00:41:10,849
Yeah. No, everything's in
perfect working order, except...

624
00:41:10,851 --> 00:41:12,585
- You're out of gas.
- Right.

625
00:41:12,587 --> 00:41:15,521
I got more gas than I need in
the back of the truck, but...

626
00:41:15,523 --> 00:41:18,190
not gonna do anyone
any good there.

627
00:41:18,192 --> 00:41:20,726
All right. Let's go
take a look, Jennings.

628
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:26,698
Do you mind?

629
00:41:28,669 --> 00:41:32,371
Could you guys shake hands
again? One more time.

630
00:41:34,908 --> 00:41:36,375
Oh, that's so good.

631
00:41:37,612 --> 00:41:40,045
All right, Jennings,
get us out of here ASAP.

632
00:41:40,047 --> 00:41:41,614
I'll figure it out.

633
00:41:44,652 --> 00:41:50,255
[Speaking Arabic]

634
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:52,091
Oh, dear God.

635
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:54,760
Just about to tell you
about her.

636
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:58,563
[Baby crying]

637
00:41:58,565 --> 00:42:00,198
Yeah, that too.

638

[Crying continues]

639
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:04,837
Specialist Tyler...

640
00:42:04,839 --> 00:42:07,439
could I have a word
with you in private?

641
00:42:08,743 --> 00:42:10,909
Absolutely.

642
00:42:10,911 --> 00:42:13,112
[Crying continues]

643
00:42:50,685 --> 00:42:55,554
All right, Specialist,
lay it on me.

644
00:42:55,556 --> 00:43:01,026
Well, I lost my escort
around 0400 hours.

645
00:43:01,028 --> 00:43:03,228
I was lucky to have gotten
around the lead vehicle,

646
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:04,697
so I went off-road.

647
00:43:04,699 --> 00:43:07,199
Figure that's where I
picked up the damage.

648
00:43:07,201 --> 00:43:09,334
Radio took a hit.

649
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:11,536
About an hour after sunup,

650
00:43:11,538 --> 00:43:13,739
she comes running out
in the middle of the road.

651
00:43:13,741 --> 00:43:15,007
I almost ran her over.

652
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:19,377
She, uh, hit the ground
pretty hard, so I stopped.

653
00:43:19,379 --> 00:43:21,113
She was a wreck, Sergeant.

654
00:43:21,115 --> 00:43:23,315
She was crying,
begging for help.

655
00:43:23,317 --> 00:43:25,150
Bashir said she wasn't
making any sense,

656
00:43:25,152 --> 00:43:28,420
and that's when we discovered
she had that baby hidden there.

657
00:43:28,422 --> 00:43:30,222
Anybody chasing her?

658
00:43:30,224 --> 00:43:31,790
No, I mean,
not that we could see.

659
00:43:31,792 --> 00:43:33,491
I don't even know
where she came from.

660
00:43:33,493 --> 00:43:36,328
There's not a lot
back in these hills.

661
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:37,763
That's all?

662
00:43:37,765 --> 00:43:39,765
That's it.

663
00:43:39,767 --> 00:43:42,434
I mean, you know,
without a radio in the truck,

664
00:43:42,436 --> 00:43:44,069
I didn't know what to do.

665
00:43:44,071 --> 00:43:45,570
And with the baby and all,

666
00:43:45,572 --> 00:43:49,374
I just put her out of sight
in the back.

667
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:52,945
We continued on to Wildside,
then this happened.

668
00:43:52,947 --> 00:43:54,847
Hmm.

669
00:43:54,849 --> 00:43:58,050
That's one hell of a story,
Specialist.

670
00:43:58,052 --> 00:43:59,684
It's all true.

671
00:44:14,869 --> 00:44:18,336
It's just a camera.
We won't hurt you. That's it.

672
00:44:18,338 --> 00:44:19,772
Tell her.

[baby coos]

677
00:44:36,623 --> 00:44:37,589
Well?

678
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:39,557
It's very hard to interpret.

679
00:44:39,559 --> 00:44:41,994
She speaks one of
the minor languages.

680
00:44:41,996 --> 00:44:43,896
Sansi, I think.

681
00:44:43,898 --> 00:44:45,931
Very hard to make out.

682
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:47,666
Great.

683
00:44:49,636 --> 00:44:51,870
Well, she knows
we'll help her,

684
00:44:51,872 --> 00:44:55,640
or she wouldn't have flagged
Specialist Tyler down.

685
00:44:55,642 --> 00:44:57,810
Conrad, go back
to the other vehicle

686
00:44:57,812 --> 00:44:59,912
and go get her
some food and water.

687
00:44:59,914 --> 00:45:00,879
What?

688
00:45:00,881 --> 00:45:02,314
You found your way
on this mission.

689
00:45:02,316 --> 00:45:03,515
Now you're part of it.

690
00:45:03,517 --> 00:45:05,784
Now move your ass.
Let's go.

691
00:45:11,591 --> 00:45:13,058
- Sergeant Jennings?
- Yeah.

692
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:14,426
Your nickname is Detroit

693
00:45:14,428 --> 00:45:15,527
because you're good
with cars, right?

694
00:45:15,529 --> 00:45:16,895
That's the rumor.

695
00:45:16,897 --> 00:45:18,630
Get your butt under
this Deuce-and-a-half,

696
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:20,732
find the problem so we can
get the hell out of here.

697
00:45:20,734 --> 00:45:24,269
- I'm on it.
- I'll help you.

698
00:45:27,074 --> 00:45:29,541
Bashir?

699
00:45:29,543 --> 00:45:32,477
Why didn't you
tell us about her?

700
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:34,880
Sergeant, there are
many like her.

701
00:45:34,882 --> 00:45:37,549
I didn't think it was
of any real importance.

702
00:45:37,551 --> 00:45:41,019
All I could think of
was helping Mr. Tyler.

703
00:45:41,021 --> 00:45:42,888
Now, is there anything else

704
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:45,523
that you have failed
to mention to me?

705
00:45:45,525 --> 00:45:48,260
No, sir.
I am very sorry.

706
00:45:48,262 --> 00:45:49,962
[Whistles]

707
00:45:49,964 --> 00:45:54,900
Wow. There's enough gas and ammo
in here to blow us all to hell.

708
00:45:56,636 --> 00:45:59,738
Or start a small war.

709
00:46:08,648 --> 00:46:12,284
- Is something wrong?
- I can't find the MREs.

710
00:46:26,934 --> 00:46:28,500
Thanks.

711
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:35,573
That was some crazy stunt
you pulled, Miss Conrad.

712
00:46:35,575 --> 00:46:37,542
Why would you do
a thing like that?

713
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:39,677
Pearls don't lie on
the seashore, Detroit.

714
00:46:39,679 --> 00:46:42,381
If you want one,
you gotta dive for it.

715
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:44,616
This one?

716
00:46:44,618 --> 00:46:46,718
Yeah, that's it.

717
00:46:47,988 --> 00:46:49,988
Hey.

718
00:46:51,158 --> 00:46:53,258
I feel kind of naked out here.

719
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:54,726
You mind sharing?

720
00:46:55,996 --> 00:47:00,432
I shouldn't,
but under the circumstances,

721
00:47:00,434 --> 00:47:02,700
here.

722
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:07,072
[Sighs]
Thanks.

723
00:47:14,315 --> 00:47:15,581
How's it going?

724
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:17,516
Nothing yet.

725
00:47:25,025 --> 00:47:27,826
You give 'em to her.
You're less threatening.

726
00:47:31,532 --> 00:47:33,632
Less threatening?

727
00:47:35,436 --> 00:47:37,068
[Chuckles]

728
00:47:37,070 --> 00:47:39,338
Yeah, you're a lot
less threatening.

729
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:43,208
Now put that away and don't
shoot yourself and jinx us.

730
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:45,944
You're getting your very own
article out of this, Sergeant.

731
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:48,681
I can't wait.

732
00:47:48,683 --> 00:47:51,417
I happen to be
an expert marksman.

733
00:47:51,419 --> 00:47:53,786
Can you say the same?

734
00:48:10,604 --> 00:48:14,039
Jake. How'd it go?

735
00:48:14,041 --> 00:48:16,408
Good for now.

736
00:48:29,857 --> 00:48:32,224
What's the short of it,
Jennings?

737
00:48:32,226 --> 00:48:33,792
We got a problem.

738
00:48:33,794 --> 00:48:36,027
Not that short.
Can you fix it?

739
00:48:36,029 --> 00:48:37,529
I think so.

740
00:48:37,531 --> 00:48:40,666
I gotta swap out a section of
this line and see if it'll hold.

741
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:42,835
And that's it? You'll be done?

742
00:48:42,837 --> 00:48:45,904
Maybe. I won't know until
I do it and then I test it.

743
00:48:45,906 --> 00:48:47,473
ETA.

744
00:48:47,475 --> 00:48:49,241
I gotta cut out
the old line first

745
00:48:49,243 --> 00:48:50,776
and then I'll know more.

746
00:48:50,778 --> 00:48:53,579
Better have some
good news for us soon.

747
00:48:53,581 --> 00:48:55,581
I'd hate to have to
blow this truck up.

748
00:48:55,583 --> 00:48:58,149
I'm doing my best.

749
00:48:58,151 --> 00:48:59,485
We know, son.

750
00:48:59,487 --> 00:49:01,052
Just get it done, Jennings.

751
00:49:01,054 --> 00:49:02,954
We gotta get outta here.

752
00:49:08,262 --> 00:49:09,862
Okay, Bashir.

753
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:12,030
Let's try this one more time.

754
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:13,198
Yes, Sergeant.

755
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:20,105
How's it going back here?

756
00:49:20,107 --> 00:49:21,273
We're doing fine.

757
00:49:21,275 --> 00:49:23,942
I think she trusts me.

758
00:49:26,847 --> 00:49:29,615
Good, because I need you
to check her out

759
00:49:29,617 --> 00:49:31,249
medically and otherwise.

760
00:49:31,251 --> 00:49:33,619
Make sure she's okay before
we take her into Wildside.

761

I'll give it a shot.

Make her understand.

to act it out or what.

772
00:50:16,196 --> 00:50:17,796
Well?

773
00:50:17,798 --> 00:50:19,965
I gotta cut a piece of line,
replace this.

774
00:50:19,967 --> 00:50:21,700
Don't look like much.

775
00:50:21,702 --> 00:50:24,770
You'd be surprised how much
trouble a little part can cause.

776
00:50:24,772 --> 00:50:26,772
Well, don't let me
stop you, Jennings.

777
00:50:26,774 --> 00:50:28,306
Get it done.

778
00:50:28,308 --> 00:50:31,944
- I'll help you cut it.
- I got a saw on the truck.

779
00:50:34,414 --> 00:50:36,515
Sergeant?

780
00:50:36,517 --> 00:50:37,516
Yeah.

781
00:50:37,518 --> 00:50:40,352
The lady wants you.

782
00:50:40,354 --> 00:50:41,787
Okay.

783
00:50:51,665 --> 00:50:53,031
Yeah, what's up?

784
00:50:53,033 --> 00:50:57,202
Thought you ought to see this.
This is bad.

785
00:50:57,204 --> 00:50:58,971
Hmm. She been whipped.

786
00:50:58,973 --> 00:51:01,740
No wonder she wanted
to get away.

787
00:51:01,742 --> 00:51:03,876
Probably punishment
for something.

788
00:51:05,613 --> 00:51:07,946
Any sign of infection?

789
00:51:07,948 --> 00:51:10,248
Not that I could see.

790
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:12,183
All right.
Well, just do what you can,

791
00:51:12,185 --> 00:51:16,788
then, uh, check the baby out,
make sure he's okay.

792
00:51:17,958 --> 00:51:19,992
And you, wait here with her,
all right?

793
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:22,327
- Of course.
- In the truck.

How's our guest?

00:51:35,776 --> 00:51:37,976
[Sighs]
Pretty rough.

796

Someone whipped
the hell out of her,

but nothing a little time
won't heal, I guess.

I guess maybe Tyler did
the right thing after all.

Maybe. Maybe not.

800

One thing he was right about:

01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:06,717
You saw how those rebels reacted
when they got a look at her.

979
01:05:06,719 --> 01:05:09,152
They fell back like
their asses were on fire.

980
01:05:09,154 --> 01:05:13,624
Well, I think
she's telling the truth.

981
01:05:13,626 --> 01:05:16,827
And if she is telling the truth,

982
01:05:16,829 --> 01:05:19,463
she's worth her weight in gold.

983
01:05:19,465 --> 01:05:21,064
What are you saying?

984
01:05:21,066 --> 01:05:25,068
Sergeant Jennings, soon as
you get finished under there,

985
01:05:25,070 --> 01:05:26,637
I want you in the front
of the vehicle.

986
01:05:26,639 --> 01:05:28,272
Conrad, I want you in
the rear of the vehicle.

987
01:05:28,274 --> 01:05:31,041
I want you guys to keep your
eyes open and your heads down.

988
01:05:31,043 --> 01:05:35,579
Now that they know we have her,
this isn't the end of it.

989
01:05:35,581 --> 01:05:37,515
Roger that.

990
01:05:37,517 --> 01:05:40,217
V, let's go for a walk.

991
01:05:46,158 --> 01:05:47,925
[Sighs]

992
01:05:51,363 --> 01:05:53,631
What's on your mind, Vic?

993
01:05:53,633 --> 01:05:58,068
What's on my mind
is Cannon and Chandler.

994
01:05:58,070 --> 01:06:00,538
They're waiting on us
back in Matubahk.

995
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:02,540
Oh, no.

996
01:06:02,542 --> 01:06:04,842
Oh, yeah.
Just hear me out.

997
01:06:04,844 --> 01:06:06,243
[Sighs]

998
01:06:06,245 --> 01:06:08,913
Vic, you can't be thinking
what I'm thinking.

999
01:06:08,915 --> 01:06:13,884
Look, Old Abdul's
daughter-in-law there,

1000
01:06:13,886 --> 01:06:17,555
she's our ticket to waltz
right back in to Matubahk,

1001
01:06:17,557 --> 01:06:21,058
extract our boys
without even firing a shot.

1002
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:23,360
Are you serious?

1003
01:06:23,362 --> 01:06:26,430
You would use that lady
and her baby as a human shield?

1004
01:06:26,432 --> 01:06:27,965
Of course not.

1005
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:29,667
I'd just have 'em along,

1006
01:06:29,669 --> 01:06:32,470
keep things peaceful, civilized.

1007
01:06:32,472 --> 01:06:34,104
That's insane.

1008
01:06:34,106 --> 01:06:35,873
Is it?

1009
01:06:35,875 --> 01:06:37,942
I got a truck
sitting right there

1010
01:06:37,944 --> 01:06:40,611
with enough firepower
to blow old Abdul and his boys

1011
01:06:40,613 --> 01:06:41,979
to kingdom come.

1012
01:06:41,981 --> 01:06:45,449
Now I got two things
that he really wants.

1013
01:06:45,451 --> 01:06:48,085
This will cost you big.

1014
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:50,420
You kidding me?

1015
01:06:50,422 --> 01:06:52,756
I'm already out 60 bucks.

1016
01:07:29,795 --> 01:07:32,196
- Beeline.
- This is COP Wildside.

1017
01:07:32,198 --> 01:07:33,430
Identify yourself.

1018
01:07:33,432 --> 01:07:36,834
Beeline, this is Overwatch
waiting for extraction.

1019
01:07:36,836 --> 01:07:39,636
Copy, Overwatch.
Message received.

1020
01:07:51,684 --> 01:07:54,285
Colonel, this just came in.

1021
01:07:54,287 --> 01:07:56,754
Well, thank Christ.

1022
01:07:56,756 --> 01:07:58,822
I swear, Chandler's got
more lives than a cat.

1023
01:07:58,824 --> 01:08:01,025
Make sure I see all
the traffic on this.

1024
01:08:01,027 --> 01:08:02,193
Yes, sir.

1025
01:08:08,101 --> 01:08:10,667
All right, everybody,
listen up.

1026
01:08:10,669 --> 01:08:12,970
This is what's gonna happen.

1027
01:08:12,972 --> 01:08:16,107
Sergeant Jennings,
very carefully,

1028
01:08:16,109 --> 01:08:19,176
is going to take everybody
back to Wildside.

1029
01:08:19,178 --> 01:08:22,479
I'm going to take command
of Tyler's vehicle.

1030
01:08:22,481 --> 01:08:23,714
Roger that.

1031
01:08:23,716 --> 01:08:25,016
As soon as you
arrive at Wildside,

1032
01:08:25,018 --> 01:08:26,850
I want you to inform
Colonel Jackson

1033
01:08:26,852 --> 01:08:28,585
that I elected
to take a slight detour

1034
01:08:28,587 --> 01:08:32,957
and reunite this young lady
and her baby with her family,

1035
01:08:32,959 --> 01:08:36,060
and that I will be following
shortly thereafter.

1036
01:08:36,062 --> 01:08:37,795
All right,
anybody have any questions?

1037
01:08:37,797 --> 01:08:39,096
Yeah. Hell yeah.

1038
01:08:39,098 --> 01:08:41,332
Sorry, Conrad,
we're out of time.

1039
01:08:41,334 --> 01:08:42,967
Godspeed.

1040
01:08:42,969 --> 01:08:44,001
Detroit.

1041
01:08:45,038 --> 01:08:47,171
You're in charge now.

1042
01:08:47,173 --> 01:08:50,274
Sergeant?

1043
01:08:50,276 --> 01:08:53,844
I can't leave you sitting in
the brig all by your lonesome.

1044
01:08:53,846 --> 01:08:56,647
Who'd you have to boss around?

1045
01:08:56,649 --> 01:08:58,682
Thanks.

1046
01:09:00,453 --> 01:09:03,120
All right,
let's gear up and move out.

1047
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:02,279
Get timers and blasting caps.

1048
01:10:06,386 --> 01:10:07,885
Here.

1049
01:10:10,990 --> 01:10:13,424
- Five minutes.
- Meet you in the square.

1050
01:10:53,199 --> 01:10:54,031
Rich.

1051
01:10:54,033 --> 01:10:56,033
Rich, wake up, man.

1052
01:10:56,035 --> 01:11:00,171
Cavalry's just arrived.
Be ready.

1053
01:11:09,315 --> 01:11:10,714
Don't run out on me,
little brother.

1054
01:11:10,716 --> 01:11:12,783
We're almost home, ya hear?

1055
01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:46,083
[Beeps]

1056
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:38,102
[sighs] Well, that answers
one of my questions.

1057
01:12:44,210 --> 01:12:46,710
And that answers the other.

1058
01:12:46,712 --> 01:12:49,680
Halfway back up the street,
right side.

1059
01:12:49,682 --> 01:12:52,349
Rooftop, Sergeant Chandler.

1060
01:12:55,154 --> 01:12:57,721
I can hardly wait to see
what happens next.

1061
01:12:57,723 --> 01:12:59,423
Let's get to it.

1062
01:13:22,748 --> 01:13:24,849
Oh, look, proud grandpa.

1063
01:13:24,851 --> 01:13:27,084
At least I hope he is.

1064
01:13:27,086 --> 01:13:31,222
You should.
Your life depends on it.

1065
01:13:38,664 --> 01:13:40,264
Good luck, buddy.

1066
01:13:40,266 --> 01:13:44,601
Hey, who needs luck
when you've got a...

1067
01:13:44,603 --> 01:13:45,702
rabbit's foot?

1068
01:13:51,410 --> 01:13:53,510
Here we go.

1069
01:14:25,511 --> 01:14:26,443
How.

1070
01:14:28,014 --> 01:14:30,047
Very amusing, Sergeant.

1071
01:14:30,049 --> 01:14:31,949
Just like I figured.

1072
01:14:31,951 --> 01:14:33,918
Educated in the States.

1073
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:35,886
Four years Liberal Arts.

1074
01:14:35,888 --> 01:14:37,521
Scholarship.

1075
01:14:37,523 --> 01:14:39,623
You?

1076
01:14:39,625 --> 01:14:41,892
Four years, high school.

1077
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:43,961
[Scoffs]

1078
01:14:43,963 --> 01:14:48,432
All right, have your men
put their weapons on the ground,

1079
01:14:48,434 --> 01:14:51,335
put their hands
behind their head,

1080
01:14:51,337 --> 01:14:54,104
and then we'll get this
whole matter all wrapped up,

1081
01:14:54,106 --> 01:14:55,539
nobody gets hurt.

1082
01:14:55,541 --> 01:14:59,310
[Laughs]

1083
01:14:59,312 --> 01:15:02,579
You truly are
a very funny man.

1084
01:15:02,581 --> 01:15:04,714
Well...

1085
01:15:04,716 --> 01:15:09,719
your daughter-in-law
sure seems to think so.

1086
01:15:09,721 --> 01:15:13,090
And what a handsome
grandson you have.

1087
01:15:13,092 --> 01:15:17,261
Yup, he has your eyes,
all right.

1088
01:15:17,263 --> 01:15:19,396
He is very dear to me.

1089
01:15:19,398 --> 01:15:23,533
My only son Emir
was killed not too long ago.

1090
01:15:23,535 --> 01:15:25,436
Very tragic.

1091
01:15:25,438 --> 01:15:30,374
Do you think your son Amir would
approve of you whipping Jada?

1092
01:15:31,910 --> 01:15:34,478
She made some bad decisions.

1093
01:15:56,902 --> 01:15:59,703
Interesting.

1094
01:16:01,374 --> 01:16:04,208
An animal's foot...

1095
01:16:04,210 --> 01:16:05,876
for good fortune?

1096
01:16:05,878 --> 01:16:09,579
Well, you'd have to ask
the rabbit about that.

1097
01:16:12,784 --> 01:16:18,422
Get Jada and my grandson
to me now...

1098
01:16:18,424 --> 01:16:20,557
and I'll let you go.

1099
01:16:25,831 --> 01:16:27,764
Is that your best offer?

1100
01:16:30,136 --> 01:16:32,569
Okay, then.

1101
01:16:32,571 --> 01:16:34,304
Stand by.

1102
01:16:46,118 --> 01:16:47,851
Well?

1103
01:16:50,189 --> 01:16:52,089
- Let her go.
- What?

1104
01:16:52,091 --> 01:16:55,225
Let her go.
What choice do we have?

1105
01:16:55,227 --> 01:16:56,793
[Sighs]

1106
01:17:22,588 --> 01:17:24,688
- [groans]
- Rot in hell, motherfucker!

1107
01:17:45,043 --> 01:17:46,176
Get back!

1108
01:18:12,671 --> 01:18:13,604
Reload!

1109
01:19:00,286 --> 01:19:02,419
Vasquez, blow it!

1110
01:19:06,825 --> 01:19:07,824
Come on.

1111
01:19:14,900 --> 01:19:16,500
VASQUEZ: Detonator fail!

1112
01:20:14,126 --> 01:20:17,093
[Camera clicking]

1113
01:20:23,469 --> 01:20:26,102
You know...

1114
01:20:26,104 --> 01:20:29,105
we're gonna be in
a lot of trouble for all this.

1115
01:20:29,107 --> 01:20:30,674
Probably.

1116
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:33,610
Most definitely.

1117
01:20:36,248 --> 01:20:39,048
I, uh...

1118
01:20:39,050 --> 01:20:41,818
I just want to say, uh...

1119
01:20:43,555 --> 01:20:44,721
thank you.

1120
01:20:46,057 --> 01:20:47,123
And?

1121
01:20:47,125 --> 01:20:49,125
You're not a jinx.

1122
01:20:50,496 --> 01:20:52,862
Wouldn't have missed it
for the world.

1123
01:20:52,864 --> 01:20:55,532
Besides, my uncle is an admiral.

1124
01:20:55,534 --> 01:20:56,933
That's right, he is.

1125
01:20:56,935 --> 01:20:58,769
So maybe you could
put a good word in for me.

1126
01:20:58,771 --> 01:21:00,470
I'm definitely gonna need it.

1127
01:21:00,472 --> 01:21:03,173
I could be persuaded.

1128
01:21:03,175 --> 01:21:05,442
Your exclusive story rights.

1129
01:21:05,444 --> 01:21:06,943
[Chuckles]

1130
01:21:09,315 --> 01:21:12,516
All right, you win.

1131
01:21:12,518 --> 01:21:13,950
What do you need from me?

1132
01:21:13,952 --> 01:21:17,688
Well, we could start
with a big hero smile.

1133
01:21:20,526 --> 01:21:21,958
Okay.

1134
01:21:29,335 --> 01:21:30,834
All right.

1135
01:21:40,813 --> 01:21:42,178
Okay.

1136
01:21:44,049 --> 01:21:45,782
Right here.

1137
01:21:51,423 --> 01:21:53,390
Ohh.

1138
01:21:53,392 --> 01:21:55,058
Man, what kept you, Vic?

1139
01:21:55,060 --> 01:21:57,794
You still sore
about that 50 bucks?

1140
01:21:57,796 --> 01:22:00,664
Nope, and it's 60.

1141
01:22:00,666 --> 01:22:02,833
Oh, you gonna
be like that now?

1142
01:22:02,835 --> 01:22:05,034
And after all the times
I saved your life.

1143
01:22:05,036 --> 01:22:06,803
All the times
you saved my life?

1144
01:22:06,805 --> 01:22:08,905
That's what people say.

1145
01:22:08,907 --> 01:22:11,641
Yeah, right,
and you don't call no more.

1146
01:22:11,643 --> 01:22:13,844
You know why?

1147
01:22:13,846 --> 01:22:16,747
We done broke the comms
in all this excitement.

1148
01:22:16,749 --> 01:22:21,251
Yeah, well, it was
a very long day, brother.

1149
01:22:21,253 --> 01:22:24,821
You know what?
When you get a minute someday,

1150
01:22:24,823 --> 01:22:26,690
you're gonna have
to tell me about it.

1151
01:22:26,692 --> 01:22:30,527
After you pay me my 60 bucks.

1152
01:22:30,529 --> 01:22:32,362
Where's Cannon?

1153
01:22:32,364 --> 01:22:35,565
He up there, yeah.

1154
01:22:35,567 --> 01:22:36,966
Good to see ya.

1155
01:22:40,038 --> 01:22:41,705
Sergeant Chandler?

1156
01:22:41,707 --> 01:22:43,139
Yes, ma'am.

1157
01:22:43,141 --> 01:22:46,810
Are you really as good
as they all say you are?

1158
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:50,013
Every once in a while.
