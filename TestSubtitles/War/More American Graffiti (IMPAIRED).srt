Big deal.

- Go home and work it out.
- I can't, Andy. I can't.

00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:02,907
Please let me stay here. Please, Andrew.

308
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:06,994
No. No, go to Mom and Dad's
or go to one of your dopey girlfriends'.

309
00:22:07,077 --> 00:22:11,665
No. No, please, I can't do that.
I won't get in your way, I promise, Andy.

310
00:22:11,749 --> 00:22:15,002
And maybe I could straighten up
this place for you.

311
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:18,339
No, thanks.
I like this place just the way it is.

Yeah, I love it. Every little
piece of trash and rancid dirt.

Now go home.
I was just getting ready to leave.

You know what I think?

316
00:22:29,016 --> 00:22:33,062
I think that Mother and Daddy made a big
mistake letting you come to this school.

317
00:22:33,145 --> 00:22:36,357
Yeah? Well you made a bigger mistake
getting married when you did.

318
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,568
I didn't have to get married.
I didn't have to get married.

No, she didn't have to get married,
the twins just arrived a little early.

Oh, that's funny. That's real funny, Andy.
Thanks a lot.

That's lovely. That's lovely.

324
00:22:56,335 --> 00:22:58,045
You're missing the point.

325
00:22:58,128 --> 00:23:01,799
We have to communicate in a vernacular
that the police will understand.

327
00:23:06,512 --> 00:23:09,348
"Pigs eat shit" does not
make an understanding police officer.

You're gonna be in big trouble.

you used to be, huh?

Remember how I used to tease you and tie
those pretty little ribbons in your hair?

331
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:23,112
- Stop it.
- What's happened to your hair? Look at that.

Andy, come on.

Buck up, kid. It'll be all right.

00:23:30,661 --> 00:23:32,454
Yeah. Thanks.

335
00:23:40,337 --> 00:23:42,923
I'll just clean up the place a little bit,
it'll make me feel a lot better.

336
00:23:43,007 --> 00:23:44,842
Don't you dare.

and I'm a friend of Moonflower...

910
01:01:35,610 --> 01:01:37,529
Don't say no more.
I know exactly who you're talking about.

911
01:01:37,612 --> 01:01:40,212
You're talking about Moonflower.
The one with the red hair, right?

912
01:01:40,282 --> 01:01:41,741
No, she's got blue hair.

913
01:01:41,825 --> 01:01:43,702
Maybe she dyed it.
Anyway, she got a ring of roses

914
01:01:43,785 --> 01:01:45,829
- tattooed around her arm, right?
- No.

915
01:01:45,912 --> 01:01:48,206
This Moonflower has roses
tattooed on her arm.

916
01:01:48,290 --> 01:01:50,208
She thought it looked pretty.
I thought it looked like a snake.

917
01:01:50,292 --> 01:01:52,335
And let me tell you,
snakes are not my style.

918

It's really funny
that you should mention snakes...

919
01:01:53,879 --> 01:01:56,882
When I was a kid, I saw a snake.
I freaked out.

920
01:01:56,965 --> 01:01:58,758
But my sister loves snakes.

921
01:01:58,842 --> 01:02:01,386
Calls her old man a snake. His name is Bill.
He's a barber.

922
01:02:01,469 --> 01:02:04,139
She shot him two years ago
right through the ass. (LAUGHING)

923
01:02:04,222 --> 01:02:05,765
But it was cool. 'Cause he's a barber.

924
01:02:05,849 --> 01:02:08,476
He works standing up
so he didn't have to sit down on it.

925
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:11,354
I wanted to tell you about this friend
of mine who plays really great guitar.

926
01:02:11,438 --> 01:02:12,478
He's really a beautiful...

927
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,357
But long hair put Bill
right out of business.

928

hamster, said it tasted like a mackerel.

- Lance Harris.

930

Never heard of him. Probably a youngie.
And I'm not a youngie.

931

But I'm not an oldie either.
But it's tough enough.

932
01:02:26,661 --> 01:02:31,583
Well, this guy is really good.
He's like Jerry Garcia, Jimi Hendrix,

933
01:02:31,666 --> 01:02:33,335
Frank Zappa, he can play anything.

- He'd be great for your group.

Lance? His name was No Pants Lance.

I'm gonna tell you something.
It's better I talk 'cause I can't spell.

Hey, listen, breaking up ain't easy to do.
I know it because I've been there before.

1520
01:45:01,380 --> 01:45:03,966
I mean, I never will
forget my old girlfriend.

Loretta Louise Willemay Jordan ll.

1522
01:45:08,137 --> 01:45:11,182
Did you know that her old man before me
was a welder?

1523
01:45:11,390 --> 01:45:13,517
And Debbie, let me tell you,
he had scars all up and down his arms.

1524
01:45:13,601 --> 01:45:15,436
You should've seen it, I mean solid scars.

1525
01:45:15,519 --> 01:45:18,240
Let me ask you a question.
You got any scars? I got an appendix scar.

1526
01:45:18,397 --> 01:45:20,816
You know what? It just came to my mind.

1527
01:45:20,900 --> 01:45:23,152
But you know, I used to know a guy
whose whole face was a soar?

1528
01:45:23,235 --> 01:45:24,737
And guess what they called him?
You won't believe it.

1529
01:45:24,820 --> 01:45:26,906
- What?
- Right? Scar. Mm-hmm.

1530
01:45:26,989 --> 01:45:28,324
But I didn't think
that was very funny because.

1531
01:45:28,407 --> 01:45:31,994
Debbie, the poor guy burned himself up
trying to pour gas in a carburetor.

1532
01:45:32,077 --> 01:45:34,580
- DEBBIE: Wait a minute...
- Speaking of gas, you know, I had beans...

1533
01:45:34,663 --> 01:45:37,082
- Stop! Stop!
- What, what, what?

1534
01:45:37,249 --> 01:45:39,502
- Can I tell you something?
- Yeah, okay. What?

1535
01:45:39,627 --> 01:45:41,837
Whatever you do,
don't hit those garbage cans!

1536

(ALL LAUGHING)

1537
01:45:51,180 --> 01:45:54,934
I wonder what the guys at the
Junior Chamber are gonna say about this.

1538
01:45:55,935 --> 01:45:57,811
I mean, it was just...
