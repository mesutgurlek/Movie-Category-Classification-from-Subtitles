Get down!

I'm coming for you.
Just keep your head down.

- You'll make it.

10
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:12,470
Come on. I want to know
how bad it is.

11
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:14,475
Okay, let's get him
on the litter!

12

Take it easy.
You'll be all right.

- How about the kid?
- He'll be fine.

- W-Was he hurt bad?
- Iodine and Band-Aids.

He's from the 8063rd.

- And ruin my hat?
- This is fightin', Klinger. You're an American.

But this is Korea... Ooh!

26

I got a sergeant here who looks pretty bad.
He can't take an ambulance trip.

Look, Doc, there's nothing
missing on me, is there?

- You're fine.

- Look at that leg. Yuck!
- Don't mind him. He's a leg man.

37
00:04:09,524 --> 00:04:11,492
Give him a unit of
whole blood and prep him.

38
00:04:11,559 --> 00:04:13,754
Frank, you ever heard
of patient morale?

39

- I'm a doctor, not an entertainer.
- You had me fooled.

- Didn't you think he was a comic?
- He's got everybody in stitches...

- whether they need them or not.
- Aw, chowderheads.

That man's a foreigner.
I'm not operating on him.

Incredible.
Who's Billy Tyler?

You know, the All-American

Everyone in Iowa
knows Billy Tyler.

- Geez, is he hurt bad?
- He ain't hurt good.

<i>Hey, Captain Pierce,</i>
<i>I got another casualty here.</i>

- That's Kornhaus.
- What team does he play for?

55
00:05:06,314 --> 00:05:08,305
He's the cook's assistant.

56
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:13,480
- What happened?
- There was a fight in Rosie's Bar.

57
00:05:13,555 --> 00:05:16,046
- This war's getting dangerous.
- What's going on here?

58
00:05:16,124 --> 00:05:18,524
Frank, this is P.F.C. Kornhaus,
the cook's assistant.

59
00:05:18,593 --> 00:05:21,790
- He slipped and cracked
his head open on some Jell-O.
- Jell-O?

60
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,593
- Dr. Pierce, it's time to wash your hands.
- Oh, is supper ready?

61
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:26,793
Must be. There's a table
waiting for you in O.R.

62
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:29,928
Jokes, jokes, jokes.
And you call yourselves doctors?

63
00:05:30,005 --> 00:05:32,064
- Only when we're sick.
- Take care of him, Frank.

64

[Groans] Next time you get near Jell-O,
wear your helmet.

65
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:43,444
Doc.
Before you put me under...

66
00:05:43,518 --> 00:05:47,147
tell me...
what are you gonna do?

67
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:51,625
- Our very best.
- Is that gonna be good enough?

68
00:05:51,693 --> 00:05:53,752
We come highly recommended.

69
00:05:53,828 --> 00:05:56,490
- And besides, we're the only game in town.
- I want it straight.

70
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:58,657
How bad am I?

71
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,928
You'll make it,
Sergeant.

72
00:06:01,002 --> 00:06:04,802
- Will the leg?
- We'll do everything we can.

73
00:06:04,873 --> 00:06:09,139
Doc, please.

74
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:13,840
If you can't save the leg,
don't save me.

75
00:06:18,486 --> 00:06:21,683
Hey, Klinger. You know where our cook is?
He's in pre-op.

76
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,986
- Better there than in the kitchen.
- It's because of you.

77
00:06:24,059 --> 00:06:27,028
- I wasn't in the fight.
- I noticed. Afraid to get your dress wrinkled?

78
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,723
- You can't wrinkle this. It's nylon.
- I oughta punch you in the nose.

79
00:06:29,798 --> 00:06:32,961
- Your fist isn't big enough.
- I can't stand any guy that
won't fight for his outfit.

80
00:06:33,034 --> 00:06:35,400
I was fighting for my outfit.
I didn't want to tear it.

81
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,404
You're a weak-kneed,
chickenhearted jellyfish!

82
00:06:37,472 --> 00:06:39,770
- You're a fat-necked, lily-livered blowhard!
- Oh, yeah?

83
00:06:39,841 --> 00:06:41,775
- Yeah!
- Will you listen?

84
00:06:41,843 --> 00:06:44,812
- What is it?
- I'm getting squished.

85
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:47,279
[Gas Hissing]

86
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:56,985
- [Potter] Can you work any faster?
- [Hawkeye] I'm already playing
the "Minute Waltz" in 30 seconds.

87
00:06:57,058 --> 00:06:59,185
Lousy peripheral pulse.

88
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:03,526
Can you find another graft, Hawk? That vein
you're hooking up to seems awfully narrow.

89
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:06,795
- This is the best one he's got left.
- You have enough five-oh silk?

90
00:07:06,868 --> 00:07:09,234
I got plenty of everything
but patient.

91
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:11,534
I wish I had
your sense of humor, Doctor.

92
00:07:11,606 --> 00:07:13,733
I wish I did too.

93
00:07:16,845 --> 00:07:19,712
Gentlemen and lady,
we have a true hero with us today.

94
00:07:19,781 --> 00:07:22,682
Sit down, Kornhaus.
A man with true esprit de corps.

95
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,980
A man who knows what
troop morale really means.

96
00:07:25,053 --> 00:07:28,022
- Burns, do me a favor.
- Anything, sir.

97
00:07:28,089 --> 00:07:30,489
Stick a handful of
retractors in your mouth.

98
00:07:30,558 --> 00:07:34,517
But, Colonel, Kornhaus went to bat
for the honor of the 4077 th.

99
00:07:34,596 --> 00:07:38,191
He may be a little bloody, but you ought to
see the other guy. Right, Kornhaus?

100
00:07:38,266 --> 00:07:41,929
- Naw, he looks pretty good.
- Yeah, I'll bet.

101
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:45,803
You're okay, Kornhaus. Well, you're in
good hands. Just a little Mercurochrome.

102
00:07:45,874 --> 00:07:47,808
This isn't gonna sting,
is it, Doc?

103
00:07:47,876 --> 00:07:49,867
Soldier, it's gonna
hurt me more than you.

104
00:07:49,944 --> 00:07:51,912
Frank's so clumsy,
he's probably right.

105
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:55,780
Colonel, will you tell Pierce not to
call me clumsy in front of Major Houlihan?

106
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,876
[Potter]
It's too late, Burns. She already knows.

107
00:07:58,953 --> 00:08:01,683
- [B.J.] Boy, this is tough.
- [Hawkeye] One of the toughest.

108
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:06,922
This place is a mess.
[Chuckles]

109
00:08:06,995 --> 00:08:09,964
Get it? A mess? I made a joke.
[Chuckles]

110
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:13,694
- So did your father.
- No, I mean it's really a mess.

111
00:08:13,768 --> 00:08:15,827
Why don't you and the nurses
decorate it up a little?

112
00:08:15,904 --> 00:08:19,362
- In war, Frank, decorations
belong on a soldier's chest.
- That's true.

113
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,068
Like my fiance,
Colonel Penobscott...

114
00:08:22,143 --> 00:08:24,441
a soldier's soldier,
a fighter.

115
00:08:24,512 --> 00:08:28,414
Oh, yeah? You want to see a fighter?
I'll show you a fighter.

116
00:08:28,483 --> 00:08:30,417
- Zale.
- Yes, sir?

117
00:08:30,485 --> 00:08:32,510
- Tell the major about Rosie's Bar.
- Huh?

118
00:08:32,587 --> 00:08:35,351
You know, how you defended
the honor of the 4077 th with your fists.

119
00:08:35,423 --> 00:08:39,826
Ah, I didn't need no fists. I use these.
I'm great at eye gouging.

120
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,829
[Chuckles]
An eye gouger. An animal.

121
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:45,832
- And he takes orders from me.
- [Scoffs]

122
00:08:48,102 --> 00:08:51,037
What are you doin' here, Zale?
This is where people eat.

123
00:08:51,105 --> 00:08:54,302
- Beat it. I'll give you 10 seconds.
- You can't count that high.

124
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:57,435
You sold out your own buddies,
Benedict Arnold.

125
00:08:57,512 --> 00:09:01,141
- Excuse me<i>. Mrs.</i> Benedict Arnold.
- I accept your apology.

126
00:09:01,216 --> 00:09:03,844
- Come on. Move it.
- Watch it.

127
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,852
I wouldn't want to
get you mad or nothin'.

128
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,252
Good. 'Cause when I get pushed,
I get sore.

129
00:09:08,323 --> 00:09:10,257
- You like mashed potatoes?
- Yeah.

130
00:09:10,325 --> 00:09:12,520
Good. Have mine!

131
00:09:14,295 --> 00:09:17,093
Thanks. Here.
Here's some lemon pie!

<i>All right, knock it off! .</i>

Knock it off!

139

There's no excuse for this sort of
animal behavior, not even from enlisted.

140
00:09:40,888 --> 00:09:44,324
Major, I'll handle this.
All right, who started it?

141
00:09:44,392 --> 00:09:46,019
- He did.
- He did.

142
00:09:46,094 --> 00:09:49,188
Well, we'll never get to the bottom of this.
Shake hands and forget it.

143
00:09:49,264 --> 00:09:51,664
Wait a second!
Clean that up.

- What else can I do?

145
00:09:54,335 --> 00:09:57,270
[Scoffs] Donald certainly
wouldn't have handled it that way.

00:09:57,338 --> 00:09:59,966
I'm not interested in how
Donald would have handled it.

147
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:02,100
- How would he have handled it?
- He'd make them fight it out.

148
00:10:02,176 --> 00:10:04,804
- That's exactly what I was going to do.
- Really?

149
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:08,474
Of course. All right,
now listen, you two bozos.

150
00:10:08,549 --> 00:10:11,143
Tomorrow, 1600 hours,
near the latrine.

151
00:10:11,219 --> 00:10:13,949
You're gonna put on the mitts, and we're
gonna see who the best man really is.

152
00:10:14,022 --> 00:10:15,956
<i>Comprende?</i> Good.

153
00:10:16,024 --> 00:10:20,154
Now, the first man knocked unconscious
will be the loser. Dismissed.

154
00:10:23,131 --> 00:10:26,066
- Frank, that took real guts.
- It did? Well, of course it did.

155
00:10:26,134 --> 00:10:28,625
- Sometimes an officer has to break regulations.
- What?

156
00:10:28,703 --> 00:10:32,833
- Just make sure Colonel Potter
doesn't hear about it.
- Who's afraid of Colonel Potter?

157
00:10:32,907 --> 00:10:36,399
1600 hours, he'll be exercising his horse.
[Chuckles]

158
00:10:36,477 --> 00:10:38,741
Besides, a man's got to be a man,
or he's not a man.

159
00:10:38,813 --> 00:10:42,977
The rule book may frown on it,
Margaret, but war is war.

160
00:10:43,051 --> 00:10:45,042
Did you take my raisin bun?

161
00:10:52,794 --> 00:10:55,456
How you feeling, Billy?

162
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,464
That's a stupid question.
You feel lousy.

163
00:10:57,532 --> 00:11:00,626
No, I feel okay.

164
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:06,106
I mean, the leg hurts,
but it's there.

165
00:11:06,174 --> 00:11:08,777
So I feel pretty good.

166
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:11,812
Listen, Billy...

167
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:16,476
You know, I played a whole quarter
against Michigan with a sprained ankle.

168
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:18,485
Hurt worse than this.

169
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:23,149
Listen, Billy. We tried,
but the artery was just too busted up.

170
00:11:23,225 --> 00:11:25,193
The operation didn't work.

171
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,455
<i>We couldn't save it.</i>

172
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:29,759
What do you mean?

173
00:11:29,831 --> 00:11:34,029
I feel that leg, Doc.
It's there.

174
00:11:34,102 --> 00:11:37,162
No, that pain you think
is in your leg is in your head.

175
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:39,833
It's called a phantom pain.
It's just a leftover.

176
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:42,638
But it's there.

177
00:11:44,713 --> 00:11:48,581
I'm not gonna listen
to some phantom pain bull.

178
00:12:07,669 --> 00:12:09,660
Oh, my God.

179
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,631
What did you guys
do to me?

180
00:12:14,643 --> 00:12:17,305
We had to, Billy.

181
00:12:18,513 --> 00:12:22,540
You had no right.
You had no right to do it.

182
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:24,551
Easy, Sergeant.
Take it easy.

183
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:27,383
<i>What's another leg</i>
<i>or arm to you?</i>

184
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:29,253
Billy, there was
just too much damage.

185
00:12:29,324 --> 00:12:32,760
- We did everything we could.
- You didn't do enough.

186
00:12:32,828 --> 00:12:36,662
- Listen, I know what you're going through.
- No, you don't.

187
00:12:36,731 --> 00:12:39,359
There's no way
you could possibly know.

188
00:12:39,434 --> 00:12:41,766
<i>[Hawkeye] You're angry.</i>
<i>I'd feel the same way if I were you.</i>

189
00:12:41,837 --> 00:12:44,601
You're not me.

190
00:12:44,673 --> 00:12:47,540
Don't tell me
how I should feel.

191
00:12:47,609 --> 00:12:51,101
- Sergeant, you need your rest.
- Why don't you try to get some sleep?

192
00:12:51,179 --> 00:12:53,670
Why don't you go to hell?

193
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:04,425
- Is it animal, vegetable or mineral?
- <i>Yes.</i>

194
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:06,927
- Come on. Which one?
- Animal.

195
00:13:08,196 --> 00:13:10,892
- A cold-blooded animal?
- Yes.

196
00:13:10,966 --> 00:13:13,833
- Then it's either a snake or Frank Burns.
- Same thing.

197
00:13:16,972 --> 00:13:19,770
You know,
I never get used to it.

198
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:22,002
I always feel there's something
more I should have done.

199
00:13:22,077 --> 00:13:24,272
You did everything
that was humanly possible.

200
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,780
I know how it's supposed
to go for them.

201
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:30,784
Shock, anger, readjustment.

202
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:32,877
But all we ever see is
the shock and the anger.

203
00:13:32,954 --> 00:13:35,980
Hawk, look what you're doing.
You're punishing yourself with guilt.

204
00:13:36,057 --> 00:13:39,618
I think I'm having
an identity crisis.

205
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:41,958
I know I'm Dr. Pierce,
but I want to be God.

206
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,794
If you ever get the job,
don't forget your old friends.

207
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:48,029
- [Knocks]
- Excuse me, sirs. Am I disturbing you, sirs?

208
00:13:48,103 --> 00:13:50,071
No. Come on in, Radar.

209
00:13:50,138 --> 00:13:53,972
- You guys mind if I have a drink?
- No, go ahead.

210
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:58,035
- I thought your liver was still a virgin.
- Don't be silly. I'm a man.

211
00:13:59,915 --> 00:14:02,145
[Gasps]

212
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:04,151
And you thought
we enjoyed this stuff.

213
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:06,687
I thought this stuff was supposed to
make you feel better.

214
00:14:06,755 --> 00:14:09,417
No. It's supposed to
make you feel nothing.

215
00:14:09,491 --> 00:14:13,894
- Maybe I ought to take some over for Billy.
- That's not what he needs.

216
00:14:13,962 --> 00:14:18,023
I know. But, boy, he was such a great
football player. What's he supposed to do now?

217
00:14:18,099 --> 00:14:20,499
Radar, there's more to life
than playing football.

218
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:22,662
I know, but gee.

219
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:27,398
I'd like to go over and talk to him
in the morning, keep him company.

220
00:14:28,777 --> 00:14:32,110
- Why don't you?
- L-I just don't know what to say.

221
00:14:33,782 --> 00:14:36,512
If you find the right words, let me know.
I sure could use them.

222
00:14:37,552 --> 00:14:39,543
Yes, sir.

223
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:44,154
- What are you doing here, pip-squeak?
- I'm leaving, sir.

224
00:14:44,225 --> 00:14:47,888
- Don't make excuses. Get out.
- <i>[Hawkeye] Frank, why don't</i>
<i>you swallow your face?</i>

225
00:14:47,963 --> 00:14:51,296
- He did. That's why he looks that way.
- What was he doing in here?

226
00:14:51,366 --> 00:14:54,802
- Something you wouldn't understand, Frank.
- He was talking intelligently.

227
00:14:54,869 --> 00:14:57,463
- He was talking about me, wasn't he?
- Oh, gee, let me think.

228
00:14:57,539 --> 00:15:00,030
Did Radar use
the word "jerk"?

229
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:04,807
That rotten fink! He snitched.
He spilled the beans, didn't he?

230
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:07,473
Yeah, he told us
all about you.

231
00:15:07,549 --> 00:15:10,746
And I set up that fight
to be top secret.

232
00:15:10,819 --> 00:15:13,083
Well, you did a good job
till a couple of seconds ago.

233
00:15:13,154 --> 00:15:16,988
If you rat on me, Klinger and Zale
are gonna get in trouble too.

234
00:15:17,058 --> 00:15:19,026
Why would we rat on you?
A fight sounds like fun.

235
00:15:19,094 --> 00:15:22,825
I like to see guys beat the hell out of
each other. It makes you forget the war.

236
00:15:22,897 --> 00:15:27,061
See, there are some things we can agree on.
[Chuckles]

237
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:29,626
1600 hours, tomorrow,
near the latrine.

238
00:15:29,704 --> 00:15:31,604
The latrine.
A perfect spot.

239
00:15:31,673 --> 00:15:33,800
- Picked the site myself.
- <i>[Hawkeye] Figures, Frank.</i>

240
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:36,139
The body goes
where the mind is.

241
00:15:36,244 --> 00:15:38,405
[Grunting]

242
00:15:42,517 --> 00:15:44,712
- Klinger, are you keeping fit or having one?
- Oh, uh...

243
00:15:44,786 --> 00:15:48,153
- I missed calisthenics this morning, sir.
- We don't have calisthenics.

244
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,157
No wonder I missed them.

245
00:15:50,225 --> 00:15:53,422
Knock it off, Klinger.
I know all about the fight. Where's Zale?

246
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:55,554
He's working out,
two tents over.

247
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,655
Come with me, Princess.

248
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:02,962
- Does this mean we're going steady?
- You're not exactly my type.

249
00:16:03,038 --> 00:16:05,666
Tell the truth.
It's my big nose, isn't it?

250
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,368
Your nose isn't too big.
Your face is too small.

251
00:16:08,443 --> 00:16:11,378
- Looks aren't everything, you know.
- Easy for you to say.

252
00:16:11,446 --> 00:16:14,347
<i>[Slapping, Groaning]</i>

253
00:16:16,718 --> 00:16:19,414
- Zale? Zale!
- Sir?

254
00:16:19,487 --> 00:16:21,978
- What were you doing?
- I was trying to tighten up the face muscles.

255
00:16:22,057 --> 00:16:23,991
Tight face,
loose brains.

256
00:16:24,059 --> 00:16:26,459
- How would you like some loose teeth?
- Hold it! Hold it!

257
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:29,986
- You two are a couple of real suckers.
- What are you talking about?

258
00:16:30,065 --> 00:16:31,999
- Whose idea was this fight?
- Wasn't mine.

259
00:16:32,067 --> 00:16:35,093
- Wasn't mine.
- Then it had to be somebody with
less brains than the two of you.

260
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:37,229
Yes, sir.
It was Major Burns.

261
00:16:37,305 --> 00:16:39,239
Don't you see
what he's doing?

262
00:16:39,307 --> 00:16:42,242
He's getting you two to punch each other
silly, so he can feel more like a man.

263
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:45,177
- You really think so?
- Is Eisenhower bald?

264
00:16:45,246 --> 00:16:47,237
Shake hands
and bury the hatchet.

265
00:16:47,315 --> 00:16:51,217
- Okay. Put your hand out and I'll shake it.
- Put yours out first.

266
00:16:51,286 --> 00:16:53,652
- After you.
- Baloney! You put your hand out.

267
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:56,987
- I don't believe it.
Two guys looking for a handout.
- You afraid I'm gonna break it?

268
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:59,390
- You couldn't break an egg with a hammer.
- I'll crack you.

269
00:16:59,461 --> 00:17:02,225
Well, if you need any more help,
please hesitate to call. Come on.

270
00:17:02,297 --> 00:17:04,697
See you later,
buzzard beak.

271
00:17:04,766 --> 00:17:08,668
If my dog had your face, I'd shave his butt
and teach him to walk backwards.

272
00:17:10,505 --> 00:17:12,564
Go take a shower, Klinger.
Cool off.

273
00:17:12,841 --> 00:17:16,106
- <i>Hawkeye! Hawk, you gotta</i>
<i>come talk to Billy.</i>
- What's the matter?

274
00:17:16,177 --> 00:17:18,907
- He wants out.
- What are you talking about? He's getting out.

275
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,914
No, he wants out out.

276
00:17:20,982 --> 00:17:23,883
He wants to be dead.
He asked for some pills or something.

277
00:17:23,952 --> 00:17:27,046
- [Sighs]
- Damn.

278
00:17:33,962 --> 00:17:36,294
- How you doing?
- Not so good.

279
00:17:36,364 --> 00:17:38,924
Word has it
you want to retire... permanently.

280
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,868
You got it, Doc. They don't make
football uniforms with one leg.

281
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:45,667
Yeah, you're right.
Once you lose a leg, nothing works anymore.

282
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:49,972
Your eyes, your mouth, your hands, your brain.
You might as well chuck it all.

283
00:17:50,044 --> 00:17:55,744
Don't try to con me. Playing ball was all I had.
It's the only thing I know.

284
00:17:55,817 --> 00:17:59,810
- And without that, you're nothing.
- Listen, I'm not stupid.

285
00:17:59,888 --> 00:18:03,051
I know what you're trying to do. You're trying
to get me to stand on my own two feet.

286
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:05,115
Well, I can't do that anymore.

287
00:18:06,394 --> 00:18:10,125
- [Sighs] Maybe you are stupid.
- What?

288
00:18:10,198 --> 00:18:14,191
If you think all you can do is play football,
you have a pretty narrow view of life.

289
00:18:14,269 --> 00:18:16,260
What were you gonna do
when you turned 40?

290
00:18:16,337 --> 00:18:18,771
I was gonna look back
on a great career.

291
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,070
Well, now you're gonna have to
look forward to something else.

292
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:25,841
Like what?
The only thing I knew how to do was run.

293
00:18:25,914 --> 00:18:28,007
You're still running, Billy.

294
00:18:29,217 --> 00:18:31,447
Only now
you're running away.

295
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,094
Sergeant,
have you got a minute?

296
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:50,137
What is it, Corporal?

297
00:18:50,205 --> 00:18:53,299
Uh, I got something
I want to show you.

298
00:18:53,374 --> 00:18:55,342
It's <i>Life</i> magazine.

299
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:58,470
There's an article in here on last year's
Iowa-Minnesota game.

300
00:18:58,546 --> 00:19:01,276
Oh, I just got it.
The mail's a little slow, you know.

301
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:04,512
Look. There's a picture
right here of you getting tackled.

302
00:19:05,653 --> 00:19:08,952
Yeah. That was in
the first quarter.

303
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:11,253
Were they wiping us up.

304
00:19:11,326 --> 00:19:14,557
Yeah, I know. I listened to that game
on Armed Forces Radio.

305
00:19:14,629 --> 00:19:17,325
Boy, what a finish.
I was sitting there screaming...

306
00:19:17,398 --> 00:19:20,561
"Go, Iowa! Go, Tyler!
Get 'em! Get 'em!"

307
00:19:20,635 --> 00:19:22,626
That was one hell of a game.

308
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:26,863
Minnesota had us
stopped dead.

309
00:19:26,941 --> 00:19:28,875
What defense.

310
00:19:28,943 --> 00:19:31,207
We couldn't move up the middle,
and we couldn't go wide...

311
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:33,338
and whenever we went to the bomb,
they intercepted.

312
00:19:33,414 --> 00:19:35,678
I know. Iowa could hardly
move the ball at all.

313
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:40,244
They had us stopped cold down to
the last two minutes of the game.

314
00:19:40,321 --> 00:19:46,089
So, we went to the short pass.
Dumping quick ones just over the line.

315
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,094
And we slowly moved the ball
down the field.

316
00:19:48,162 --> 00:19:50,687
And then you dove over
in the last 20 seconds.

317
00:19:50,765 --> 00:19:53,598
It was those short passes
that did it.

318
00:19:54,969 --> 00:19:57,233
There's always
a way to beat 'em.

319
00:19:57,305 --> 00:20:00,900
You just have to keep trying
till you find it.

320
00:20:18,126 --> 00:20:20,560
- [Frank] Where's the ring announcer?
- [Radar] Here, sir.

321
00:20:23,531 --> 00:20:25,522
Will you hurry up?

322
00:20:27,802 --> 00:20:31,294
- You nincompoop!
- I'm sorry, sir. I was never very good at ropes.

323
00:20:31,372 --> 00:20:34,341
- Make the announcement.
- Yes, sir. [Clears Throat]

324
00:20:34,409 --> 00:20:36,400
- Oh, bell.
- [Clanking]

325
00:20:36,477 --> 00:20:41,540
In this corner,
wearing olive drab trunks from Brooklyn...

326
00:20:41,616 --> 00:20:45,313
"Smile when you say that"...
Sergeant "Killer" Zale.

327
00:20:45,386 --> 00:20:49,152
- Hey! Yeah!
- [Cheering]

328
00:20:49,223 --> 00:20:52,659
Isn't this exciting, Major?
People fighting, punching each other out?

329
00:20:52,727 --> 00:20:54,661
Of course it isn't.
I think it's barbaric.

330
00:20:54,729 --> 00:20:56,822
- And you wouldn't miss it for the world.
- Right.

331
00:20:56,898 --> 00:21:01,125
- [Clanking]
- And in this corner...

332
00:21:01,258 --> 00:21:05,251
<i>wearing pink pedal pushers,</i>
<i>a polka-dot blouse and a swell cherry hat...</i>

333
00:21:05,329 --> 00:21:07,593
from Toledo, Ohio...

334
00:21:07,665 --> 00:21:12,159
Corporal Max
"I'll do anything to get out" Klinger!

335
00:21:12,236 --> 00:21:15,728
<i>[Cheering, Whistling]</i>

336
00:21:17,241 --> 00:21:20,108
Animals.

337
00:21:20,177 --> 00:21:23,203
Okay, you guys know the rules.
I want a nice, clean fight.

338
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,215
And if you can't do that,
anything goes. You got that?

339
00:21:26,283 --> 00:21:29,150
All right. Back to your corners
and come out at the sound of the bell.

340
00:21:30,688 --> 00:21:33,657
Be careful. I'd hate to see
a nice outfit like that get ruined.

341
00:21:33,724 --> 00:21:36,318
- Don't worry, Captain.
We got it all worked out.
- <i>[Pot Clangs]</i>

342
00:21:36,393 --> 00:21:38,987
- I think that's for me.
- It's not for me.

343
00:21:39,063 --> 00:21:42,396
[All Yelling]

344
00:21:50,241 --> 00:21:53,699
Aw, why don't they hit each other?
They're just dancing around.

345
00:21:53,778 --> 00:21:56,042
I think they went to
the Arthur Murray school of boxing.

346
00:21:56,113 --> 00:22:00,447
Come on, you guys. Mix it up!
Throw some punches. That's an order.

347
00:22:02,453 --> 00:22:04,614
Come on. Mix it up!

348
00:22:07,725 --> 00:22:09,716
Come on. Fight, you bums!

349
00:22:11,095 --> 00:22:14,258
- [Cheering, Yelling]
- [Laughing]

350
00:22:14,331 --> 00:22:18,165
- Frank sure knows how to put on a fight.
- It was a knockout.

351
00:22:18,235 --> 00:22:21,636
It just proves the old adage: "He who lives
by the mouth gets punched in it."

352
00:22:21,705 --> 00:22:24,765
- How old is that adage?
- At least three or four seconds.

353
00:22:33,484 --> 00:22:35,475
There we go.

354
00:22:35,553 --> 00:22:38,420
Well, so long, Billy.

355
00:22:38,489 --> 00:22:40,923
- I'm gonna miss talking to you.
- Yeah.

356
00:22:40,991 --> 00:22:42,925
I'm gonna miss
you too, Walter.

357
00:22:42,993 --> 00:22:47,225
- Billy and me call each other
by our first names.
- Did you make any decisions yet?

358
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:50,790
I decided to go
to the short pass.

359
00:22:50,868 --> 00:22:52,301
- Hey.
- How's that?

360
00:22:52,369 --> 00:22:54,098
I'll explain it
to you later.

361
00:22:54,171 --> 00:22:59,131
Oh, by the way, Doc,
I know you did all you could.

362
00:23:00,611 --> 00:23:03,478
Thank you.

363
00:23:05,149 --> 00:23:07,811
Good luck, Billy.

364
00:23:16,594 --> 00:23:18,858
You know something?

365
00:23:18,929 --> 00:23:20,920
I think
he's gonna be okay.

366
00:23:20,998 --> 00:23:22,932
I hope so.

367
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,492
- What was that he said about the short pass?
- It means he's gonna try.

368
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:30,506
Hey, Captain, what do you say we go over
to Rosie's Bar and get a drink? My treat.

369
00:23:30,574 --> 00:23:34,533
- Thanks, Radar.
- Can you get drunk on grape Nehi?

370
00:23:34,612 --> 00:23:36,603
I don't know.
Let's find out.

371
00:23:41,318 --> 00:23:43,252
- What happened?
- Huh?

372
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,983
- What happened?
- Of course I'm not happy. They hit me.

373
00:23:47,057 --> 00:23:49,855
What do you want me to do?
Kiss it and make it better?

374
00:23:49,927 --> 00:23:53,260
I want Corporal Klinger and Sergeant Zale
court-martialed.

375
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:56,822
- Will that get me out of here?
- Out of here and into the stockade.

376
00:23:56,901 --> 00:24:01,065
- One step too far.
- If we go to the stockade,
we're not going alone.

377
00:24:01,138 --> 00:24:04,005
- You wouldn't dare, you freak!
- Sticks and stones.

378
00:24:04,074 --> 00:24:08,272
- Sir, what happens to officers
who break regulations?
- Several of them.

379
00:24:08,345 --> 00:24:11,041
They get busted
and thrown in the stockade.

380
00:24:11,115 --> 00:24:15,609
It's up to you. Should we air
our dirty lingerie in public, sir?

381
00:24:15,686 --> 00:24:18,519
Uh, let's not.
Colonel, permission to drop all charges.

382
00:24:18,589 --> 00:24:20,648
Permission granted.
Dismissed.

383
00:24:22,026 --> 00:24:23,994
- I thought you handled that very well, sir.
- What?

384
00:24:24,061 --> 00:24:26,154
- He said you're an idiot, Major.
- He said what?

385
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:27,720
I can't hear you.
