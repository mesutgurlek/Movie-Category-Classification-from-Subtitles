We had Weimy, our sniper.

He grew up in the middle
of the Mojave Desert.

he grew up in East LA gangland.

He had a Silver Star for pulling

everything back home
needs to be in balance.

aren't right with the family,

things aren't right with the finances
or something's off,

212
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:54,039
it's gonna put us all out of balance, so we
need to have that tight before we launch.

that Morales was working on,

296
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:42,759
Senior Chief, you got
any updated source intel

297
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:45,559
on numbers inside the camp,
and what about roving patrols?

298
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:48,679
Maybe eight to ten, bro, but we don't
know anything about roving patrols.

299
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:50,479
You're just gonna have to assume
that they're out there

300
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:52,759

They do this for a living, too.

Senior, what kind ofweapons-on-target
are we looking at?

302
00:19:55,439 --> 00:19:57,559
Heavy weapons.
These guys are narco-traffickers,

303
00:19:57,719 --> 00:19:59,799
so they can have anything
from Soviet-bloc DShKs.

304
00:19:59,959 --> 00:20:02,719
They could have M2HP,
.50-cals out there, we don't know.

305
00:20:02,879 --> 00:20:05,999
So if there is a weapons' emplacement up
there, I suggest you guys bring rockets.

306
00:20:06,199 --> 00:20:09,719
Of course, rockets and foliage don't match,
so make sure you got a clear shot.

Miss Morales may have bled there, too,
but these guys are savages,

311
00:20:21,239 --> 00:20:23,799
so you're gonna have to assume
that she is non-ambulatory,

00:20:23,959 --> 00:20:26,239
