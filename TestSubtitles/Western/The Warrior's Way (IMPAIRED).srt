[Male narrator] Okay.
Settle down.

00:00:26,984 --> 00:00:28,724
Got your ears open?

[Clears throat]

4
00:00:32,448 --> 00:00:35,565
This is the story of a sad flute

5
00:00:35,659 --> 00:00:38,526
a laughin' baby
and a weepin' sword.

6
00:00:46,211 --> 00:00:52,081
A long, long time ago
in a land far, far away,

7
00:00:52,176 --> 00:00:54,792
there lived a warrior...

8
00:00:54,887 --> 00:00:57,503
warrior with empty eyes.

9
00:02:33,694 --> 00:02:37,027
He'd trained his entire life
for one purpose.

10
00:02:39,616 --> 00:02:43,484
To be the greatest swordsman
in the history of mankind.

11
00:03:28,665 --> 00:03:31,577
He'd just achieved
his life's ambition,

12
00:03:31,668 --> 00:03:34,375
but his heart felt emptier
than ever.

13
00:03:37,674 --> 00:03:41,542
These two clans had been warrin'
for 500 years.

14
00:03:41,637 --> 00:03:44,595
And they vowed to keep on warrin'
until one of them

15
00:03:44,681 --> 00:03:47,093
didn't have a single man
left above Styx.

[coos, giggles]

19
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,876
And so now, here he was,

20
00:04:19,967 --> 00:04:22,925
peerin' down
at this very last of his enemy.

21

[Baby coos, laughs]

22
00:04:33,313 --> 00:04:36,476
When that
little warrior princess giggled,

23
00:04:36,566 --> 00:04:38,648
it did somethin' to him inside.

24
00:04:41,113 --> 00:04:42,853
But this was no time for feelin'.

25
00:05:12,728 --> 00:05:15,014
For when spared that baby's life,

26
00:05:15,105 --> 00:05:19,064
he put his name at the top
of his own clan's death list.

27
00:06:19,544 --> 00:06:23,787
With nothin' but the clothes on his back
and the baby in his arms,

28
00:06:23,882 --> 00:06:29,218
he decided to pay a visit to an old
warrior friend in a faraway land.

29
00:08:02,606 --> 00:08:04,016
Hey, Johnny.

The name's Eight-Ball.
Like in the game.

33
00:08:14,201 --> 00:08:16,442
Good luck for some,
bad luck for others.

34
00:08:16,536 --> 00:08:20,154
How can I assist you,
my friend from the mystical East?

35
00:08:23,793 --> 00:08:25,454
Uh-oh.

[Laughs]

39
00:08:43,146 --> 00:08:46,388
For a guy who cleaned sheets all day,
he sure liked to make a mess

00:08:46,483 --> 00:08:48,974
in the after-hours,
if you know what I mean.

41

Sorry about the tap I gave ya.
I thought you knew the sword.

a guy who was gonna roll into town.

But I shoulda figgered.

00:11:19,427 --> 00:11:22,715
Well, if you were his friend,
maybe he would like for you

to take over his laundry.

around here.

That's how I repaid Smiley
for teaching me the sword.

Only thing was,
when we went to bury her,

163
00:23:42,044 --> 00:23:43,454
she was still breathing.

164

that close to kickin' it.

165

if'n she was gonna live or die.

166
00:23:54,265 --> 00:23:57,757
So we just put her in bed
and waited.

167
00:23:57,852 --> 00:24:00,685
Two days,
and she was eating soup.

168
00:24:00,771 --> 00:24:03,854
By the day three, she was already
sitting up somehow

169
00:24:03,941 --> 00:24:05,977
and slinging daggers
at the wall.

170

But God ain't fair.

just ain't cut out for the knife.

Why you do that?

192
00:27:24,475 --> 00:27:27,717
Okay.

193

Why are y'all called
The Sad Flutes?

194

to the tunes of The Sad Flutes--

200
00:27:55,089 --> 00:28:00,675
We are called Sad Flutes
because when you cut the throat,

201
00:28:00,761 --> 00:28:04,128
the last sound is like a sad flute.

202

a dead cat into a party room, don't ya?

Why'd you become a Sad Flute?

205

207
00:28:32,668 --> 00:28:36,160
My father was working in the field.

208
00:28:36,255 --> 00:28:37,745
I was helping him.

209
00:28:39,842 --> 00:28:42,709
A swordsman came.

210
00:28:42,803 --> 00:28:44,384
Killed my father.

211
00:28:44,471 --> 00:28:47,713
Just to test his sword.

212
00:28:49,643 --> 00:28:51,884
That musta hurt you
somethin' bad.

213

Not hurt. Angry.

No.

216

I was angry at my father.

217

Here. Take it.

218
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,713
It's a present.
My momma gave it to me.

219
00:29:28,807 --> 00:29:33,597
She said, "If you hold it
over your heart when you're sad,

220
00:29:33,687 --> 00:29:35,928
it takes away all your sadness."

You've sealed it.

Think of the sword
as part of the body.

249
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:27,015

Join the others in Stockton.
I'll catch you up.

330
00:42:51,985 --> 00:42:53,521
Hyah! Hyah!

331
00:42:53,611 --> 00:42:57,399
[Laughter and whooping]

332
00:42:57,490 --> 00:43:00,277
Gentlemen, I have a few old memories
I'd like to revisit.

333
00:43:00,368 --> 00:43:02,700
Follow me.
[Clicks tongue]

334
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:30,012
Dang it!
He killed my whole family!

335
00:43:30,106 --> 00:43:33,519
God damn it, Baptiste,
let me go or I swear I'm gonna--

336
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:36,101
-- I-I-I'm sorry, Lynne.
-- Lynne.

337
00:43:36,195 --> 00:43:38,151
This ain't just for your protection,
you know.

338
00:43:38,281 --> 00:43:40,146
It's for the whole goddamn town.

339
00:44:02,722 --> 00:44:04,804
[Door closes]

340
00:45:06,911 --> 00:45:08,526
Let me see!

341
00:45:13,042 --> 00:45:15,909
We have a winner!
Gentlemen?

342
00:45:16,003 --> 00:45:17,584
[Man] Maria!

[Gun cocks]

[speaks Spanish]

345
00:45:24,178 --> 00:45:28,046
He is your, uh...
marido?

346
00:45:28,141 --> 00:45:29,881
My apologies.

347
00:45:29,976 --> 00:45:34,936
I am not the kind of man
who sleeps with a married woman.

348
00:45:35,022 --> 00:45:36,228
No.

349
00:45:36,315 --> 00:45:39,432
Por favor.
Gracias, Senor!

350
00:45:41,821 --> 00:45:43,436
[Woman screams]

351
00:45:43,531 --> 00:45:45,271
Mommy! No!
[Both sobbing]

352
00:45:46,617 --> 00:45:48,653
Oh!

353
00:45:48,745 --> 00:45:51,578
But their daughters...

354
00:45:51,664 --> 00:45:53,529
Oh, that's a completely
different matter.

355
00:45:53,624 --> 00:45:55,660
Clean them up.

356
00:45:55,752 --> 00:45:58,494
You get a bullet in the head
for every louse I find.

357
00:46:17,648 --> 00:46:21,015
I once strung a man up
by his own hamstrings

358
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:23,101
because he cooked me a steak
well-done.

359
00:46:23,196 --> 00:46:25,027
[Laughs]

360
00:46:27,074 --> 00:46:28,484
What?

361
00:46:28,576 --> 00:46:30,988
Find that funny?

362
00:46:31,078 --> 00:46:32,864
Or is it because of this?

363
00:46:32,955 --> 00:46:35,492
[Door opens]

364
00:46:38,836 --> 00:46:40,076
Thank you, gentlemen.

365
00:46:40,171 --> 00:46:43,459
This girl says she'll serve herself
up to you instead of the spics.

366
00:46:46,719 --> 00:46:49,335
Have we, uh, met before?

367
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:52,638
No. We haven't.

368
00:46:52,725 --> 00:46:57,185
This is bound to be a night
you will never forget.

369
00:47:06,322 --> 00:47:08,153
You have good teeth.

370
00:47:08,241 --> 00:47:10,857
I like that.

371
00:47:10,952 --> 00:47:14,615
Colonel, as you unwrap me,

372
00:47:14,705 --> 00:47:17,993
I'm sure you will find there's
a whole lot more of me to like.

373
00:47:18,084 --> 00:47:20,541
I have no doubt of that.

374
00:47:20,628 --> 00:47:22,209
And though I may be young,

375
00:47:22,296 --> 00:47:25,288
I was hopin' you could teach me
a thing or two.

376
00:47:25,383 --> 00:47:27,669
Life's best lessons tend to hurt.

377
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,469
Sharp pain
can bring sharp pleasure.

378
00:47:37,353 --> 00:47:39,765
Tell them to get.
This ain't the theatre.

379

Gentlemen, you heard the lady.
Make yourselves scarce.

She's not here!

Now I, I might say
some things during.

Feel free to answer if you like.

385
00:48:33,451 --> 00:48:36,409
Nothing is too wrong.

386
00:48:38,039 --> 00:48:41,827
I've been waitin' my whole life
for a place

387
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:43,624
where it's right to be wrong.

[Grunts]

389
00:48:49,133 --> 00:48:55,800
You know, I don't think any part
of the body is dirty or bad.

390
00:48:55,890 --> 00:48:59,428
Just as long as it's well-scrubbed

391
00:49:02,521 --> 00:49:03,886
Yes.

Now.

394
00:49:43,813 --> 00:49:47,931
Now where do you plan
to begin the inspection?

395

[Water splashing]
I like where the skin creases...

396

Between your nice... big...

it all came flooding back.

No girl could ever smell as sweet.

That certainly is a beautiful scar
I gave you.

[Grunts] A hard-on for a scar.

to fry up some potatoes

[chuckles]

415
00:51:29,085 --> 00:51:31,747
And while we're waiting,
I thought I should give you

416
00:51:31,837 --> 00:51:37,377
what I was so generously offering
ten years ago.

417

Now the Colonel's coming back,
and he's bringing the whole damn family.

We need the guy who did
that butcher job in the saloon.

Well, I say
we all just pack up and leave.

438

He's right! If you stay and fight,
you'll die like rats.

439
00:55:05,217 --> 00:55:07,378
Well,
we'll die like rats with rifles.

440
00:55:07,469 --> 00:55:08,925
What rifles?

441
00:55:09,013 --> 00:55:11,629

and a buncha juggling idiots.

Follow me.

446
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:52,758
I ruined everything.
Didn't I?

447
00:55:54,767 --> 00:55:56,632
You did what you had to do.

448
00:55:59,897 --> 00:56:03,685
You coulda just grabbed April
and hit the trail.

00:56:03,776 --> 00:56:05,812
But you didn't.

450
00:56:05,903 --> 00:56:10,488
Knowing saving me would ruin
every new thing you found here.

and go and we're still breathin'.

00:56:38,227 --> 00:56:39,967
That is the plan.

00:56:42,189 --> 00:56:44,521
Um...

457
00:56:44,608 --> 00:56:47,395
Maybe I could go with you?

00:56:52,116 --> 00:56:54,072
Just think about it, alright?

Yee-haw! Whoo!

463
00:58:29,671 --> 00:58:32,162
I knew what you was
from the get-go.

464
00:58:32,257 --> 00:58:35,420
Don't need to look
at the size of a man.

465
00:58:35,511 --> 00:58:37,843
I can smell the blood.

466
00:58:37,930 --> 00:58:40,012
It was on you, too.

467
00:58:42,643 --> 00:58:43,928
Yeah.

468
00:58:48,232 --> 00:58:49,642
Good.

00:58:49,733 --> 00:58:52,395
Now,
get my jacket clean if you can.

470
00:58:52,486 --> 00:58:55,603
If I'm gonna die,
I want to look good doing it.

471
00:58:55,697 --> 00:58:57,403
Why die?

472
00:58:57,491 --> 00:59:00,324
'Cause we only got about a hundred
sticks of dynamite and a few weapons.

That ain't much more
'n to sting them with.

Well, for a laundry man.

476
00:59:35,237 --> 00:59:38,149
You do a good shooting.

-- For a drunken man.
-- [Chuckles]

478
00:59:41,326 --> 00:59:42,987
Why you stopped the shooting?

479
00:59:43,078 --> 00:59:48,869
Well, I just went around
robbing banks, hitting trains

480
00:59:48,959 --> 00:59:54,579
till I ran into the only force
that can truly bring down any outlaw.

481
00:59:54,673 --> 00:59:56,664
Sheriff?

[Grunts] Woman.

483
01:00:01,388 --> 01:00:03,970
When I was with her,
I didn't wanna run.

484
01:00:07,686 --> 01:00:09,392
What happened then?

485
01:00:09,479 --> 01:00:13,222
There was a couple of Rangers
who hadn't forgot about me.

486
01:00:15,319 --> 01:00:18,607
They ambushed me.

487
01:00:18,697 --> 01:00:20,688
Bullets flyin' everywhere.

488
01:00:22,576 --> 01:00:24,316
One of 'em found Beth.

489
01:00:26,163 --> 01:00:31,248
Last thing she ever said to me was,
"Don't never pick up no gun again."

490
01:00:32,336 --> 01:00:35,248
So far...

491
01:00:35,339 --> 01:00:38,046
