Well, I figured if there was any trouble-

There ain't gonna be no trouble.

old Mexico, just below the border.

298
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:14,236
- Like it down there?
- Oh, fine cattle country.

299
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:18,332
But you sure gotta be handy with a
gun. Shootin' scrapes all the time.

300
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:20,604
Guess who I seen killed in
a fight just before I left.

301
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:22,680
- Who?
- FrankJames.

302
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,613
Has he been down there?

303
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,689
<i>[Clem] Yes, sir, and he's gonna stay
down there, six feet under the ground.</i>

304
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,623
<i>They must have pumped 15 slugs into him.</i>

305
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:39,186
Well, he had it comin' to him, I
reckon. Let's go and have a drink.

306
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:42,698
I need one. I'm spittin' sand
hills. Wait till I get my saddlebags.

307
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:45,361
So, they finally got Frank.

308
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,700
Appears that way.

309
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:55,873
[Chattering]

310
00:26:57,882 --> 00:26:59,873
I done all right, huh?

311
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:03,011
Fine. I once seen Booth, and
he couldn't acted it better.

312
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,612
Thanks. You think the news will get around?

313
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:07,885
Hope so. Once the Fords find out I'm dead...

314
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:10,188
maybe they'll come out of
their hole, wherever they are.

315
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:12,388
- Well, the Fords aren't
the only ones- - Shh.

316
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:15,398
The Fords aren't the only
ones you gotta play dead for.

317
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,871
- McCoy's got a reward out.
- I know. I got a letter from the major.

318
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:27,240
McCoy's got an idea I had something
to do with that express job.

319
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:29,711
Suspicious cuss, ain't he?

320
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:32,408
- Major write you they found out about the farm?
- No.

321
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:35,213
Well, they have. McCoy's
got a flock of men...

322
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,414
watching every road and
cow path around there.

323
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:41,014
I think it's all right
though. Pinky won't talk.

324
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:44,562
No, Pinky won't talk, but
it's just as well I'm dead.

325
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,654
- What'll it be?
- Beer.

326
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:48,824
- And what for you?
- Make his sarsaparilla.

327
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:50,901
Right.

328
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:53,664
Now what'd you do that for? I've tasted beer.

329
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:59,042
Mr. Woodson, sir. Lady wants to see you.

330
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:02,079
- A lady?
- Yes, sir. She's waiting in the parlor.

331
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,648
Give me half a dollar to fetch ya.

332
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:10,781
- All right.
- This way, sir.

333
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:22,959
- Mr. Woodson?
- Yes, ma'am?

334
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:25,400
I'm sorry to bother you, but
I'm looking for the man...

335
00:28:25,503 --> 00:28:27,471
who saw FrankJames killed in Mexico.

336
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:30,564
And they told me he was
talking to you on the porch.

337
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:33,041
It was me that seen the killing, ma'am.

338
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:36,739
- Oh, then it's you I wanna talk to.
- Just a minute, miss.

339
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:38,816
Who are you, if you don't mind?

340
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:41,715
My name's Eleanor Stone.
I'm a newspaper writer.

341
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,811
I was passing the hotel,
and somebody told me that-

342
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:46,220
A writer? You mean you
write pieces for the paper?

343
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:49,623
<i>Yes, a reporter for the Denver Star.</i>

344
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:52,788
A lady reporter?

345
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,058
Mind if I sit down? It'll be
easier for me to take notes.

346
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:58,329
Sure do beat all, a lady newspaperman.

347
00:28:58,436 --> 00:29:01,769
Well, I'm not really and
truly a reporter, not yet.

348
00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:04,501
<i>But I'm going to be. My
father's the owner of the Star.</i>

349
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:06,770
Maybe you've heard of him
- Randolph Stone.

350
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:08,846
Well, can't say I have.

351
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:11,347
But if he owns the paper, I should
think he'd be doing well enough...

352
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:13,440
so his daughter don't have to work.

353
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:15,781
Oh, I don't have to work.
And, if you must know...

354
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:17,855
my father's very much opposed to it.

355
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:21,115
He thinks I should finish college...

356
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:23,421
and then sit around with my hands folded...

357
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:27,020
waiting for someone to
get around to marrying me.

358
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:29,828
I'll do nothing of the sort.

359
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,925
Women are awakening.

360
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:34,596
- They wanna do things.
They- - Not where I come from.

361
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:39,040
Women figure they're doing plenty feeding
a dozen farmhands and raisin' kids.

362
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:42,773
We can't all feed farmhands and have babies.

363
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:47,113
Everybody to their taste.
I wanna be a newspaperwoman.

364
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:49,880
<i>Now tell me about Frank James.</i>

365
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:55,119
If I can get a good story, maybe my father
will be convinced I can be a reporter.

366
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,119
Won't you help me?

367
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:02,859
Sure, we'll help.

368
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:05,492
Go ahead. Tell her everything, son.

369
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:10,233
[Clears Throat] Well, it all
happened about six weeks ago.

370
00:30:10,341 --> 00:30:12,332
We'd been down in
Hernandez herdin' longhorns.

371
00:30:12,443 --> 00:30:15,469
And that night we went into
town to do a little drinkin'.

372
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:19,311
- A boy like you?
- Ma'am, I ain't no boy.

373
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:23,080
<i>Down in Mexico, I do a man's
work and a man's drinkin'.</i>

374
00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:27,022
When we got to WhiskeyJoe's, there was a
drunken crowd there from another ranch...

375
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:29,093
a
- roughin' things up.

376
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:31,856
FrankJames- Oh, I've seen
him a couple times before-

377
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:36,366
he was up at the bar, drinkin'
quiet and mindin' his own business.

378
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:38,833
You taking this down in
that newfangled shorthand?

379
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:42,429
Oh, no, just making notes as
I would in classes. Go ahead.

380
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:45,008
So, this crowd from the other ranch was a
- whoopin' it up...

381
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:47,509
especially the foreman,
a fella they call Red-

382
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:51,708
Oh, like this
- when a girl comes in the place.

383
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:56,253
Oh, a little girl, maybe 10
or 12, lookin' for her pa.

384
00:30:56,354 --> 00:31:00,290
Red makes a grab for her, and
she starts cryin' and a-screamin'.

385
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:03,724
And that plumb annoys Frank.

386
00:31:03,828 --> 00:31:06,854
He comes over from the bar...

387
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:10,264
and he pulls the girl away from
Red and knocks him a-kickin'.

388
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:13,531
<i>Right away I knows there's
gonna be trouble in bushel lots.</i>

389
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:15,868
<i>Everybody exceptin'Red's
gang runs out of the place.</i>

390
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:18,442
It bein' none of my ruckus,
I ducks behind the bar.

391
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:21,444
But Frank don't scare any.

392
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:24,982
He pulls his gun and stands
with his back up against the bar.

393
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:29,281
It's one against 12 or 15. Red
and his crew start blazin' away.

394
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:32,049
And Frank's blazin' right
back. He knocks off two guys...

395
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:34,124
and then gets hit himself in the left arm.

396
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:36,716
<i>Well, to make it short, he finishes off Red.</i>

397
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:39,729
Good. Good!

398
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:41,924
Better be takin' all this down, miss.

399
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:45,230
<i>- It's all right. I'll remember.
- Uh, where was I?</i>

400
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:48,897
Oh, yeah. He finishes off Red
and five or six of his gang.

401
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:51,407
By this time, Frank himself
is leakin' like a sieve.

402
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:54,444
He's down on the ground,
dyin', but still fightin'...

403
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:56,604
when a slug gets him in the heart.

404
00:31:56,714 --> 00:31:59,740
Then the fellas that are left
empty their guns into him.

405
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:03,309
- Oh, the cowards!
- This belonged to Frank.

406
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,514
See, it's marked F.J.

407
00:32:05,623 --> 00:32:08,592
I picked it up figuring I could give it
to his kinfolks if I ever run into them.

408
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:10,786
Oh, what a wonderful story for the paper.

409
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:13,420
Oh, yes, wonderful story.

410
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:17,661
Thank you. Thank you ever so
much. Oh, I must have your name.

411
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:21,000
Uh, Grayson. Tom Grayson.

412
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:24,097
Did you say this happened six weeks ago?

413
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:26,938
Then he couldn't have been mixed up
in that Missouri express robbery...

414
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:29,946
that I've been reading
about, where a man was killed.

415
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:32,448
Oh, no, Frank had been in Mexico over a year.

416
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:34,643
FrankJames never killed nobody.

417
00:32:34,752 --> 00:32:37,619
Of course, I ain't countin'
that Mexico business.

418
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:41,180
He and his brother must have been
wonderfully colorful characters.

419
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:45,126
I wish I could have known him. Well,
I must hurry along to the paper.

420
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:48,062
Good-bye, and thank you so much.

421
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:58,837
I, uh
- Sometimes I... might have news.

422
00:32:58,943 --> 00:33:02,902
- Could I see you?
- I'd be glad to see you anytime.

<i>You'll always be able to
reach me at the Star... now.</i>

424
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:39,173
Well, it's very good. But I still think
a newspaper is no place for a woman.

425
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:43,083
- Now, now, dear, please don't be so severe.
- Edna, don't interfere.

426
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:46,088
But, Papa, you've got to admit...

427
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:49,387
this is the biggest scoop
you've had in six months.

428
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:54,022
Been telegraphed all over the
country, and I got it for you.

429
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:57,533
No, my dear, you just stumbled
on it. That can happen to anybody.

430
00:33:57,635 --> 00:34:00,365
- But I do go on the payroll, don't I?
- Thank you.

431
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:03,531
I don't know. I don't know.
I've got to think that over.

432
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:09,272
No, thank you.

433

884
01:11:09,064 --> 01:11:12,295
No. No, there's nothing
you or I or anybody can do.

885
01:11:12,401 --> 01:11:14,426
We've just got to wait and hope.

886
01:11:14,536 --> 01:11:18,734

hopin' or waitin' if it wasn't for you.

What'd you have to keep after him for?

01:11:26,081 --> 01:11:28,447
Now, on account of you,
they're gonna hang him.

891
01:11:35,157 --> 01:11:38,251
Raise your right hand, place your left hand
on the Bible. Do you swear to tell the truth...

892
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:40,351
the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

893
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:42,521
- I do.
- Sit down.

894
01:11:45,768 --> 01:11:48,828
- You're FrankJames?
- No doubt about that.

895
01:11:48,937 --> 01:11:51,132
Why are you here?

896
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:53,231
- Why?
- Yeah. You weren't captured.

897
01:11:53,342 --> 01:11:55,640
- You weren't brought in on a fugitive warrant.
- I come in.

898
01:11:55,744 --> 01:11:58,110
In other words, you're here voluntarily, eh?

899
01:11:58,213 --> 01:12:01,376
As far as the State's concerned,
you might still be at large.

900
01:12:01,483 --> 01:12:04,043
I object. That is a conclusion!

901
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:06,053
Objection sustained.

902
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:10,353
The witness will not be asked
to speculate. You may proceed.

903
01:12:10,459 --> 01:12:13,917
You came in voluntarily. Why?

904
01:12:14,029 --> 01:12:16,759
Well, they was aimin' to swing
Pinky for somethin' he didn't do-

905
01:12:16,865 --> 01:12:19,698
something he didn't even know
anything about- so I figured that-

906
01:12:19,802 --> 01:12:25,741
So you figured you'd risk your own neck to
save the life of a poor, innocent old darky.

907
01:12:27,576 --> 01:12:31,376
Your Honor, I must protest!
I must protest, Your Honor.

908
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:35,712
The witness isn't being asked to give
testimony. He's being led into argument.

909
01:12:35,818 --> 01:12:40,448
The point is well-taken, but when
a man is on trial for his life...

910
01:12:40,556 --> 01:12:44,617
the court is inclined to give
wide latitude to the defense.

911
01:12:44,727 --> 01:12:48,823
Now take it easy, Major. You'll have
plenty of opportunity to make arguments.

912
01:12:48,931 --> 01:12:52,458
<i>- You needn't do it through the witness.
- I stand rebuked, Your Honor.</i>

913
01:12:52,568 --> 01:12:55,867
[Clears Throat] You did rob
the express office, didn't you?

914
01:12:55,971 --> 01:12:58,371
- Reckon I did. - Mm-hmm.
What'd you do with the money?

915
01:12:58,474 --> 01:13:00,567
- Used it huntin' the Fords.
- No other purpose?

916
01:13:00,676 --> 01:13:04,544
No. It was McCoy money gotJesse
murdered, so I took McCoy money.

917
01:13:04,646 --> 01:13:07,638
- Your Honor!
- Major, I want to be fair with you.

918
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:10,275
In fact, I've been leaning
over backwards to be fair, but-

919
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:15,255
It's all right, Your Honor. I'm finished
with the witness. McCoy can have him. I-I-

920
01:13:15,357 --> 01:13:19,623
I mean- I mean, uh- I mean McCoy's
man. No, no, no, doggone it.

921
01:13:19,728 --> 01:13:22,561
- I- I mean the prosecuting
attorney. - [Laughter]

922
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:30,138
<i>- [Gavel Banging] - I'm- I'm sorry,
Your Honor, but my tongue got twisted.</i>

923
01:13:34,009 --> 01:13:38,207
- You say you didn't kill the watchman, Wilson.
- I had no reason.

924
01:13:38,313 --> 01:13:41,009
- Do you always need a reason for killing?
- Don't you?

925
01:13:41,116 --> 01:13:45,610
I'm not on trial. Your accomplice
could've shot Wilson, couldn't he?

926
01:13:45,721 --> 01:13:48,053
- Yeah, could have.
- Ah.

927
01:13:48,157 --> 01:13:50,785
But he didn't. Shot from
the outside got Wilson.

928
01:13:50,893 --> 01:13:54,124
I suggest that you caused
the death of the watchman...

929
01:13:54,229 --> 01:13:57,562
either directly or by using him
as a shield in making your escape.

930
01:13:57,666 --> 01:14:00,760
Can't arrest you for
suggestin', but tain't so.

931
01:14:00,869 --> 01:14:03,099
Tell me...

932
01:14:03,205 --> 01:14:06,868
just where was the watchman,
Wilson, when he was hit?

933
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:08,966
Well, let me see. I think he-

934
01:14:09,077 --> 01:14:11,568
Never mind what you think. Where was he?

935
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:15,081
Sorry. I can't talk without
thinkin', not bein' a lawyer.

936
01:14:15,184 --> 01:14:18,984
<i>[Spectators Laughing]</i>

937
01:14:31,233 --> 01:14:33,258
Your name is BreckenridgeJackson?

938
01:14:33,368 --> 01:14:35,019
<i>- Colonel BreckenridgeJackson, sir.
- Well, Colonel Jackson.</i>

939
01:14:35,054 --> 01:14:36,670
<i>- Colonel BreckenridgeJackson, sir.
- Well, Colonel Jackson.</i>

940
01:14:36,772 --> 01:14:39,332
You say that you've known
FrankJames for many years.

941
01:14:39,441 --> 01:14:42,069
- Are you doubtin' my word, sir?
- I merely asked you a question, sir.

942
01:14:42,177 --> 01:14:44,475
I answered for my friend, the major...

943
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:47,174
and you, sir, were in
the room at the same time.

944
01:14:47,282 --> 01:14:50,012
- Are you deef?
- My hearing is perfectly good.

945
01:14:50,118 --> 01:14:54,418
Very well. Then I advise you, sir, to pay
attention to what's goin' on in this here courtroom.

946
01:14:54,523 --> 01:14:57,754
<i>[Spectators Laughing]</i>

947
01:15:01,897 --> 01:15:05,333
Please answer all questions put to
you, directly and without discussion.

948
01:15:05,434 --> 01:15:08,665
- As a character witness- -
I shall do as you wish, sir.

949
01:15:08,770 --> 01:15:13,434
There is no favor I can refuse the man who
led the courageous attack at Ball's Bluff.

950
01:15:13,542 --> 01:15:17,273
- All right, all right, but let's get on.
- Very well, sir.

951
01:15:19,481 --> 01:15:21,540
<i>- What do you want to know, Yankee?
- [Laughter]</i>

952
01:15:23,418 --> 01:15:25,545
Now, Colonel-

953
01:15:27,789 --> 01:15:29,780
When did you first meet FrankJames?

954
01:15:29,892 --> 01:15:32,486
As a boy of 14 or 15,
when he first joined up.

955
01:15:32,594 --> 01:15:36,155
- You mean when he joined Quantrill's guerrillas?
- Guerrillas?

956
01:15:36,265 --> 01:15:40,463
- Did I hear you say guerrillas?
- I believe they're generally known as such.

957
01:15:40,569 --> 01:15:42,594
Only to those who cravenly fled before them.

958
01:15:42,704 --> 01:15:46,299
The finest cavalry in war, sir.
The flower of Southern horse.

959
01:15:46,408 --> 01:15:49,673
<i>- Why, at the battle ofThree
Oaks- - Come, come, come.</i>

960
01:15:49,778 --> 01:15:52,144
Let's get on with the trial.

961
01:15:52,247 --> 01:15:54,306
Am I to tolerate insults to the South?

962
01:15:54,416 --> 01:15:57,852
Well, I don't feel
insulted. The next question.

963
01:15:57,953 --> 01:16:01,252
I did have a number of questions
to ask this witness, Your Honor...

964
01:16:01,356 --> 01:16:03,415
but rather than refight
the entire rebellion-

965
01:16:03,525 --> 01:16:07,655
Rebellion, did you say, sir?
If you are, by any chance...

966
01:16:07,763 --> 01:16:10,596
referring to the late
unpleasantness between the States...

967
01:16:10,699 --> 01:16:14,066
that, sir, was a war for
the Southern Confederacy.

968
01:16:14,169 --> 01:16:15,966
That isn't what they
call it where I come from.

969
01:16:16,071 --> 01:16:19,837
Well, that's what this court calls
it, and let the record so show.

970
01:16:21,376 --> 01:16:25,472
- You may proceed.
- State rests.

971
01:16:30,452 --> 01:16:33,250
- Yankee.
- [Laughter]

972
01:16:36,558 --> 01:16:40,790
As to the robbery itself, I need say nothing.

973
01:16:40,896 --> 01:16:46,266
FrankJames admits that with an unknown
accomplice, he broke into the express office...

974
01:16:46,368 --> 01:16:51,237
cracked open the strongbox
and escaped with the contents.

975
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:55,538
May I assume that even my
learned opponent will agree...

976
01:16:55,644 --> 01:16:58,977
that breaking into a place and
robbing it is a punishable offense.

977
01:16:59,081 --> 01:17:02,482
- Go on, talk to the jury. They have to listen to you.
- [Laughter]

978
01:17:07,155 --> 01:17:11,387
But FrankJames's crime
did not end with robbery.

979
01:17:11,493 --> 01:17:13,484
There was murder as well-

980
01:17:13,595 --> 01:17:16,564
<i>foul, bloody murder...</i>

981
01:17:16,665 --> 01:17:21,102
<i>murder that cries aloud for
justice against its perpetrator.</i>

982
01:17:22,771 --> 01:17:25,638
FrankJames killed the watchman, Wilson...

983
01:17:28,243 --> 01:17:30,609
and you, as honest men...

984
01:17:30,712 --> 01:17:34,808
will see that he pays for his
crime at the end of a rope.

985
01:17:37,552 --> 01:17:43,320
- It's all my fault.
- I wouldn't feel that way about it if I was you.

986
01:17:43,425 --> 01:17:46,861
After all, you only did
what you thought was right.

987
01:17:46,962 --> 01:17:49,123
When I talked to Frank in Denver...

988
01:17:49,231 --> 01:17:53,167
I was thinking only of an
innocent man condemned to death.

989
01:17:53,268 --> 01:17:57,329
I didn't think that perhaps I
was sending Frank to his death.

990
01:17:57,439 --> 01:18:02,843
- What business was it of mine?
- Now listen, Frank's not going to his death.

991
01:18:02,944 --> 01:18:05,504
Ten years, I figure, maybe 15.

992
01:18:05,614 --> 01:18:08,549
If I only hadn't persuaded him.

993
01:18:08,650 --> 01:18:13,417
My dear, I'm afraid you're
overcalculatin' your powers of persuasion.

994
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:17,219
You figure it was your persuasion
that made him come in, don't you, huh?

995
01:18:17,325 --> 01:18:19,350
Well, you're mistaken.

996
01:18:19,461 --> 01:18:23,261
He'd have come in and when he
did, even if he'd never met you.

997
01:18:23,365 --> 01:18:25,356
You're saying that to make feel better.

998
01:18:25,467 --> 01:18:28,698
No, no, no. I'm not. I'm saying
it because it's the truth.

999
01:18:28,804 --> 01:18:30,999
Frank would never have let Pinky die.

1000
01:18:31,106 --> 01:18:35,133
You see, I
- I know him better than you do.

1001
01:18:35,243 --> 01:18:38,474
[Clears Throat] Well, it's time
to be gettin' back to court.

1002
01:18:40,115 --> 01:18:44,142
Come along. You see, I think-

1003
01:18:45,821 --> 01:18:48,051
Frank had only one thought:

1004
01:18:48,156 --> 01:18:51,592
to avenge the cowardly
murder of his brotherJesse.

1005
01:18:51,693 --> 01:18:55,185
<i>But to get on the track of the Fords
he needed money, and he had none.</i>

1006
01:18:55,297 --> 01:18:59,563
- You boys know how rich you get workin' a rocky Ozark farm.
- [Laughing]

1007
01:19:02,137 --> 01:19:06,870
So, in desperation, and only as a
last resort, did Frank turn to robbery.

1008
01:19:06,975 --> 01:19:09,944
But let us see. [Clears Throat]

1009
01:19:10,045 --> 01:19:14,209
Did he rob a bank containing the
thrifty savings of the poor? No.

1010
01:19:14,316 --> 01:19:17,012
Did he rob an honest shopkeeper? No.

1011
01:19:17,119 --> 01:19:19,212
He took money from the railroad...

1012
01:19:19,321 --> 01:19:24,349
the railroad that had caused the
death of his mother and his brother.

1013
01:19:24,459 --> 01:19:28,259
The railroad that stole your lands and
drove you from your farms, the railroad-

1014
01:19:28,363 --> 01:19:31,958
- I object! - Your
objection is well-taken.

1015
01:19:32,067 --> 01:19:34,627
Now let me remind you, Major, again.

1016
01:19:34,736 --> 01:19:37,261
The St. Louis Midland is
not on trial in this court.

1017
01:19:37,372 --> 01:19:39,431
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

1018
01:19:39,541 --> 01:19:43,272
Now just try and forget what
I said about the railroad.

1019
01:19:43,378 --> 01:19:46,643
And there is no evidence whatsoever
that Wilson, the night watchman...

1020
01:19:46,748 --> 01:19:49,410
was killed by a bullet from a. 44.

1021
01:19:49,518 --> 01:19:51,543
There is more than a
reasonable doubt about it...

1022
01:19:51,653 --> 01:19:55,282
since even the autopsy
surgeon himself couldn't tell.

1023
01:19:57,159 --> 01:20:01,118
Now this is the weapon FrankJames
had when he surrendered...

1024
01:20:01,229 --> 01:20:03,220
and the weapon he has always carried.

1025
01:20:03,331 --> 01:20:08,132
I know 'cause I gave it to him myself
the day he went to join Quantrill.

1026
01:20:08,236 --> 01:20:12,570
You see the initials on it- F.J. -
and the date. Here. See here. Here.

1027
01:20:12,674 --> 01:20:17,111
- This is very irregular, Your Honor. The evidence is in.
- Let him proceed.

1028
01:20:17,212 --> 01:20:19,442
Your Honor.

1029
01:20:19,548 --> 01:20:24,451
This weapon of Frank's has a very interesting
history. Yes, sir, right from the start.

1030
01:20:24,553 --> 01:20:27,784
Its first bullets were fired at those dad
- blasted Kansas jayhawkers...

1031
01:20:27,889 --> 01:20:29,914
when they come a-raidin' here.

1032
01:20:30,025 --> 01:20:32,255
