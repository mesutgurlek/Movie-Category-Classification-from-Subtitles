1
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,490
Turn him over.

2
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:33,830
Oh, no!

3
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,740
"Do not drink wine nor strong drink...

4
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:29,040
"...thou nor thy sons with thee...

5
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,380
"...least ye shall die.

6
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:34,780
"Look not thou upon
the wine when it is red...

7
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:39,390
"...and when it bringeth his color
in the cup when it moveth itself aright.

8
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,290
"...at the last it biteth
like a serpent...

9
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,400
"...and stingeth like an adder."

10
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,730
Now, folks...

11
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,810
...that's from the Good Book...

12
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,570
...but in this town...

13
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,240
...it's five cents a glass.

14
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,980
Five cents a glass.

15
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:07,750
Does anyone really think
that is the price of a drink?!

16
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:11,160
The price of a drink let him decide...

17
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,990
...who has lost his courage and pride...

18
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,760
...who lies a grovelling
heap of clay not far removed...

19
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,220
All's quiet, sir.

20
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,390
Let's fall in.

21
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,000
Follow me.

22
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,420
I beg your pardon m'am.

23
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,590
- I'm so sorry.
- Allow me, ma'am.

24
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,850
Thank you.

25
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,190
May I?

26
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,690
Thank you.

27
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:10,100
Hey, Thornton, wake up! Soldiers!

28
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,270
Look.

29
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:23,220
I don't care what you meant to do...

30
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,220
...I don't like what you did.

31
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,060
You inconvenienced this lady,
and made a fool of yourself...

32
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,130
...and this railroad.

33
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:39,410
Now, I want you to apologize to this...

34
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,400
Yes, may I help you?

35
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,480
If they move, kill them.

36
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,650
Is he with them?

37
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,660
He's there.

38
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,420
Hold your fire! Get down!

39
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,090
Wait till they come out.

40
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,590
I can nail him.

41
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,260
I said, wait!

42
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,770
What if they go out the back?

43
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:19,610
It's covered. You two-bit
redneck peckerwood.

44
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:23,940
Abe.

45
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,790
I solemnly promise...

46
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:41,970
...God helping me...

47
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:45,470
I solemnly promise, God helping me...

48
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:49,530
...to abstain from all
fermented malt liquors...

49
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:52,470
...including wine, beer and cider.

50
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:56,550
...to abstain from liquor,
wine, cider and beer.

51
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:28,340
People marching down the street.
They'll pass by the horses.

52
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,740
We'll join them.

53
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,240
The Temperance Union?!

54
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,250
They should have been told.

55
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:40,520
Told what?

56
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,750
How long can anybody in this
manure pile keep his mouth shut?

57
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:56,610
"Yes we gather at the river

58
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:01,040
"The beautiful, beautiful river.

59
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,380
"Gather with the saints at the river."

60
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,610
Rifles.

61
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:10,950
One...

62
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,060
...no, three!

63
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,230
Maybe more, there, on the roof.

64
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,730
Get down.

65
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,470
Son-of-a-bitch!

66
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,730
Bounty hunters?

67
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,800
Hell, I wouldn't know.

68
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,410
Buck with Abe.

69
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,140
I kill them now?

70
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,250
Hold them here as long as you can.

71
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,920
I'll hold them till hell freezes over
or you say different.

72
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,270
When I kick him out, blast him.

73
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,840
We'll run for it.

74
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,340
Give me that gun.

75
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:09,170
"Oh the beautiful river.

76
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,950
"Gather with the saints at the river

77
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:16,010
"That flows by the throne of God."

78
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,010
Set?

79
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,440
Let's go!

80
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,620
Good luck, boys!

81
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:33,150
They're blowing this town to hell!

82
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,500
You trash!

83
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,530
Now you just hush now.

84
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,480
Hey, they was playing
"Gather at the River."

85
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,820
You know that one?

86
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,150
Sing it!

87
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:40,320
"Shall we gather at the river

88
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:44,230
"Where bright angel feet have trod."

89
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,520
Hurry!

90
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:13,520
"River that flows by the throne of God."

91
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,490
Come on, you lazy bastard!

92
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,750
I'm coming!

93
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,330
They've cleared out, for chrissake!

94
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:27,930
Let's go, T.C.!

95
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,520
Let's go!

96
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,050
Take him!

97
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,650
He's mine!

98
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,490
He's mine!

99
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,240
He's mine!

100
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,230
I shot this one!
Look at the size of that hole!

101
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:46,340
You just dig out that bullet
and see if it ain't my.06!

102
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,840
You know I shot him.

103
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:50,920
You'd claim the whole thing,
wouldn't you?!

104
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:54,240
Daddy! Daddy!

105
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,020
Damn!

106
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,420
Damn, I can't get his money belt off!

107
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,590
You stupid damn fools!

108
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,030
Why did you shoot this employee
and let the others get away?

109
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,930
I didn't! My first shot
killed this man right here!

110
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,370
Liar!

111
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:17,540
He shot that employee while I dropped
this bandit and them others too.

112
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,870
I must've killed all three of them.

113
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:22,540
What were we doing up on that roof?!

114
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,940
Liar!

115
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,780
Black liar!

116
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,940
Don't talk like that to me.

117
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,110
I'm sorry.

118
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,790
Come on, T.C., help me get his boots.

119
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:41,460
I think this will do pretty good.

120
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:47,300
Next time, plan the massacre carefully,
or I'll start with you.

121
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:50,810
Why didn't you kill Pike
when you had the chance?

122
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:01,650
Hey, stop!

123
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,810
Stop!

124
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:08,420
Feathers flew like a turkey!

125
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,090
They shouldn't have run.
They shouldn't have run.

126
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,320
Say!

127
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:24,770
Well, how'd you like to kiss
my sister's black cat's ass?

128
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,790
It's better than a hog-killing!

129
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,620
Get them out of here!

130
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:54,970
We're holding you and your railroad
responsible for this carnage!

131
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:57,540
Innocent people are dead!

132
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:01,370
Women dying and hurt because
you used our town as a battlefield!

133
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:04,980
The railroad is going to pay
for our loss of blood!

134
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,480
We were trying to catch outlaws!

135
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,310
You lured them in here!

136
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:13,220
The railroad has been blabbing
about a big payload for weeks!

137
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:15,120
We represent the law!

138
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,680
Pike, is that you?

139
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,020
I can ride.

140
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:48,750
I can ride.

141
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,100
I can't see, but I can ride.

142
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,360
No!

143
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,090
I can't ride.

144
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,360
Finish it.

145
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,410
You boys want to move on,
or stay and give him a...

146
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,230
...decent burial?

147
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,630
He was a good man.

148
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,570
We should bury him.

149
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,080
He's dead!

150
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,570
With a lot of men to keep him company!

151
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,320
Too damn many!

152
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,490
I think the boys are right.

153
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:53,980
I'd like to say a few words
for the dear dead departed.

154
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:57,490
Maybe a few hymns'd be in order!

155
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,830
Followed by a church supper...

156
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,330
...with a choir!

157
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:04,670
You crazy bastards, both of you!

158
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,240
Bishop, Engstrom...

159
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,180
...the Gorch brothers!

160
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:24,260
Amounts to a total of $4,500
and you let them ride out on you!

161
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,690
When the money value
of the men you killed...

162
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:31,630
...less my commission adds up to $500!

163
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:35,870
Any one of those pelts would have
not only cleared you with the company...

164
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,970
...but have given you money
to raise hell with!

165
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,200
We'll do better next time!

166
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:45,030
We'll do anything you say, but we'd
appreciate liquor money tonight.

167
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:48,870
There won't be any tonight!
You go after them in ten minutes!

168
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:52,040
Get them! Get Pike and you'll be rich!

169
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:54,480
And if any one of you
tries to quit on me...

170
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,480
...I'll pay a bonus of $1,000...

171
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,050
...to the man that kills him!

172
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:16,060
Let's pack it up then!

173
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:24,510
- Why should I let you go with them?
- We've been over that.

174
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,580
You might join them again.
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

175
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:32,190
What I like and what I need
are two different things. Listen.

176
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:36,090
I don't want to go back
to prison, never again.

177
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,230
But it's got to be my way!
But I need some good men!

178
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,130
You saw what happened
out there this morning!

179
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,900
You use what you have and see to it
that it doesn't happen again...

180
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,330
...or I'll see to it that you spend
the rest of your life behind bars.

181
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,330
Try to run, I'll be after you.

182
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,530
I gave my word.

183
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:50,540
We'll see what it's worth!

184
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,840
Six minutes.

185
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:55,040
Tell me...

186
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:56,840
...how's it feel...

187
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:58,710
...getting paid for it?

188
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:04,620
Getting paid to sit back and hire your
killings with the law's arms around you?

189
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,550
How's it feel to be so goddamn right?

190
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:08,450
Good.

191
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,960
You dirty son-of-a-bitch!

192
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:15,300
You've got 30 days to get Pike
or 30 days to get back to Yuma.

193
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:18,370
You're my Judas goat, Mr. Thornton.

194
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:22,870
I want all of them back here,
head down over a saddle.

195
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,810
Thirty days to get Pike
or 30 days back to Yuma.

196
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,000
I don't see nothing so
lindo about it.

197
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,830
Just looks like more of Texas to me.

198
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:56,500
You have no eyes.

199
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:30,370
Got a half hour of light. Let's go.

200
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,380
Hello, little fella.

201
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,100
- Them other fellas...
- They're not coming!

202
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,360
None of them?

203
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:37,770
- But I got horses and saddles for them.
- We'll need them, they won't.

204
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,540
About the sharing up.

205
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:17,550
It will be the same as always.

206
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:22,490
Me and Tector don't think that
he ought to get the same amount.

207
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:26,920
He's just starting out, and this is
our opening for a new territory.

208
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,120
That's right.

209
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:33,260
I figure a share to that old goat for
watching the horses is a share too much.

210
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:39,170
So, we decided...

211
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,060
...it ain't fair.

212
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:47,280
If you two don't like equal shares, why
the hell don't you just take all of it?

213
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,280
Why don't you answer me,
you damned yellow trash?!

214
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,010
Now, Pike, you know...

215
00:25:56,190 --> 00:26:00,680
I don't know a damned thing except
I either lead this bunch or end it now.

216
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,700
We divide it up like you say.

217
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:16,600
Chick, chick, chick, chick,
chick, chick, chick.

218
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,890
Silver rings.

219
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:37,120
Silver rings, your butt!
Them's washers! Damn!

220
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,330
Bastards!

221
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,990
Washers!

222
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:53,410
We shot our way out of that town
for a dollar's worth of steel holes!

223
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,740
They set it up!

224
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:58,850
They? Who in the hell is "they"?!

225
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,080
"They"?!

226
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:10,520
"They" is just plain and fancy "they."

227
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,100
That's who "they" is.

228
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:16,260
Caught you, didn't they?
Tied a tin can to your tail!

229
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,260
Led you in and waltzed you out again!

230
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:23,170
Oh, my, what a bunch!

231
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,100
Big tough ones!

232
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:30,880
Here you are with a handful
of holes, a thumb up your ass...

233
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:34,620
...and a big grin to pass
the time of day with.

234
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:36,620
"They"!

235
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,950
Who the hell is "they"?

236
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,190
Railroad men.

237
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,560
Bounty hunters.

238
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,300
Deke Thornton.

239
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,570
Deke Thornton?

240
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:56,200
He was one of them?

241
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,810
How come you didn't know that?

242
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:02,910
Hey, gringo.

243
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:08,810
You can have my silver.

244
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:12,080
Come on, don't kill me.

245
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,600
You can have the silver.

246
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:22,660
But don't kill me.

247
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:24,830
Please.

248
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,740
Go on...

249
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:32,730
...go for it.

250
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,180
Fall apart.

251
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,950
Walk softly, boys.

252
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,880
What's our next move?

253
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,040
I figure Agua Verde is the closest.

254
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:16,290
Three days, maybe.

255
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:19,050
We'll get news and go to the border.

256
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,150
Maybe a payroll or bank.

257
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:24,490
Maybe that damn railroad!

258
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:28,500
That damn railroad you're talking
about sure isn't getting no easier.

259
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:31,290
And you boys ain't getting any younger.

260
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,800
We must start thinking beyond our guns.

261
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:37,240
Those days are closing fast.

262
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:49,520
All your planning and talking
damn near got us shot...

263
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:52,520
...over a few lousy bags of washers.

264
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:56,420
This was going to be
me and Tector's last job!

265
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,530
We spent all our time and
money getting ready for this!

266
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:04,700
You spent time and money running whores
while I spent my stake setting it up!

267
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:18,050
I should have been running whores
instead of stealing army horses!

268
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,780
While you did the planning...

269
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:24,120
...me and Tector was getting
our bell rope pulled by two...

270
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:26,720
...two mind you, Hondo whores!

271
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:33,620
And Pike was dreaming of washers!

272
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,860
He was.

273
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:43,130
You were matching whores...

274
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,640
...in tandem!

275
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,570
What's that?

276
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,570
One behind the other.

277
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,650
That's right!
That's what we was doing!

278
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,160
Mr. Thornton.

279
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,510
You rode with Pike.

280
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:28,180
What kind of man we up against?

281
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:29,680
The best.

282
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:34,520
He never got caught.

283
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,540
This was going to be my last.

284
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:09,380
Ain't getting around any better.

285
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:19,740
I'd like to make one
good score and back off.

286
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,240
Back off to what?

287
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:38,090
Have you got anything lined up?

288
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:45,760
Pershing's got troops spread out
all along the border.

289
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:50,000
Every one of those garrisons
will get a payroll.

290
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,940
That kind of information
is kind of hard to come by.

291
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:57,870
I didn't say it's going to be easy,
but it can be done.

292
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,210
He'll be waiting for us.

293
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,280
I wouldn't have it any other way.

294
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,530
Come on Pike, let's go.

295
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:25,470
You sound like you're all caught up.

296
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,300
Enough to know we've overstayed
our welcome.

297
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:30,300
What's wrong with you?

298
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,910
We've got plenty of money to spend,
and no worries.

299
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:36,980
They're not going to look for us
in their own backyard.

300
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:38,410
How can you be so damn sure?

301
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,980
Being sure is my business.

302
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:44,550
Being sure is my business.

303
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:48,490
Hold it!

304
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,060
Relax.

305
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,420
It's just some champagne we ordered.

306
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:56,060
Relax, it's just some champagne.

307
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:59,830
Being sure is my business.

308
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,940
Did you get him?

309
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,780
No, he got away.

310
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:18,790
You sure must have hurt that railroad.

311
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:22,350
They spent a lot of money
setting up that ambush.

312
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,590
I caught up with them.

313
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,020
Two or three times.

314
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:29,030
There was a man named Harrigan.

315
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,030
He used to have a way of doing things.

316
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,470
I made him change his ways.

317
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,300
And a hell of a lot of people...

318
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,310
...just can't stand to be wrong.

319
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:42,470
Pride.

320
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:44,040
And they can't forget it.

321
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,980
That pride, being wrong, or learn by it.

322
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,050
How about us?

323
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,830
You reckon we learned...

324
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,490
...being wrong today?

325
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,570
I sure hope to God we did.

326
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,350
Them's hot.

327
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,660
Hot damn!

328
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:38,870
Where in hell did you find him?

329
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,030
He ran with Thornton and me.

330
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:43,940
Did his share of killing, and more.

331
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:45,540
Around Langtry.

332
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:51,180
Only now he does his killing
with a coffee cup.

333
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,920
I wouldn't have it any other way either.

334
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,330
Watch out, boys!

335
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:55,440
Take it easy!

336
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:59,510
Keep his head up!
What's wrong with you?!

337
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,350
Watch him, Tector!

338
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:17,030
Goddamn! Son-of-a-bitch!

339
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:20,860
Get the horses up!

340
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,970
What the hell is going...

341
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:27,030
- Damned clumsy old bastard!
- Get up!

342
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:30,710
Get up now! Get up there, goddamn it!

343
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:36,380
Help!

344
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:38,490
Get over here! Help!

345
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:43,160
What's the matter with you, old man?!

346
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,890
Leave him alone!

347
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:49,560
He'll get us all killed!
I'm going to get rid of him.

348
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,790
You better not! We're sticking
together, like it used to be.

349
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:58,170
When you side with a man, you stay with
him. If you can't, you're an animal!

350
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:00,000
You're finished!

351
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,510
We're finished! All of us!

352
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,510
Mount up.

353
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:32,970
Appears Brother Pike needs help.

354
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:35,640
That Brother Pike
and the old man Sykes...

355
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:37,750
...makes me wonder if it ain't time...

356
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:40,280
...to pick up my chips
and find another game.

357
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:53,160
How can you side anybody
when you can't get on your horse?

358
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:29,650
That was a fine talk you gave the boys
about sticking together.

359
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,330
That Gorch came near killing me.

360
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,590
Or me him.

361
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,930
Damned old fool like me's
not worth taking along!

362
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:44,670
- We start together, we'll end together.
- That's how I see it.

363
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,940
That's the way it's always been with me.

364
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:50,670
Sorry about Deke.

365
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:52,610
I never figured him that way.

366
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:55,110
Say...

367
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:56,780
...back there in Starbuck...

368
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,620
...how did my boy do?

369
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,620
Your boy?

370
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:03,020
Crazy Lee?

371
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:05,460
Yes, C.L. Clarence Lee.

372
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:08,620
My daughter's boy.
Not too bright, but a good boy.

373
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,960
I kill'em now? I kill'em now?

374
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,970
No, you just hold them here.

375
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:19,470
Why didn't you say
he was your grandson?

376
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:23,140
You had enough things on your mind.

377
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:26,980
Besides, he must pull his own weight
like the rest of us.

378
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:32,820
I just wanted to make sure he didn't
let you down when things got hot.

379
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:36,990
He did fine.

380
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:38,890
Just fine.

381
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,690
All clear!

382
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:24,870
From here on it's Mexico, Mr. Thornton.

383
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,110
What's the closest town of any size?

384
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:30,540
Agua Verde.

385
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,780
What's in Agua Verde?

386
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:36,040
Mexicans, what else?

387
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:43,060
A headquarters for regulars
fighting against Villa.

388
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:44,960
Mapache territory.

389
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:49,900
Don't we follow?

390
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:51,600
No, we go back and wait.

391
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:55,060
We're supposed...

392
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,730
Shut up!

393
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:01,240
Why won't you tell your folks
to feed them dogs?

394
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:05,250
Won't find very much around here.
That damn Huerta's scraped it clean.

395
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:07,650
I have invited you to my village.

396
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:11,590
Any disrespect to my family
or to my people...

397
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,250
...I will kill you.

398
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:15,590
Ashamed of having us meet your people?

399
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:19,500
Yes. They don't know about
my life when I leave the village.

400
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:21,000
You got a sister?

401
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:23,770
I'd be proud to make her acquaintance...

402
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:26,100
...and that of your mama too.

403
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,500
That goes for your grandma too, sonny.

404
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,020
How bad was it?

405
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:54,520
Seven of the villagers were killed.
Two of them hung.

406
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:58,030
Our horses, cattle and corn, stolen.

407
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:01,140
What about the federal troops?
Didn't they protect you?

408
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:03,470
They were federal troops...

409
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:06,200
...commissioned by the traitor Huerta.

410
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:08,800
And the soldier who shot my father?

411
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,310
What was his name?

412
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:14,150
- What does it matter?
- Your father died like a man.

413
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:16,810
The names are not important.

414
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:18,890
How was he called?

415
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:21,380
Mapache.

416
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:23,720
That is name enough.

417
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,160
In Mexico...

418
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:30,320
...these are the years of sadness.

419
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:32,070
But if we had...

420
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,000
...rifles like these...

421
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:37,330
And Teresa? Did they molest her?

422
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:44,240
She went with them
because she wished to.

423
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:47,010
She became the woman of Mapache...

424
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:50,340
...and the others.
She went with them, laughing.

425
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:53,520
Drunk with wine and love.

426
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:59,350
To him, Teresa was a goddess,
to be worshipped from afar.

427
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:02,370
I tell you, she was a mango...

428
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:04,020
...ripe and waiting.

429
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:07,600
Angel dreams of love and
Mapache eats the mango.

430
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:11,940
That's a good trick.

431
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:27,380
Now I find that hard to believe.

432
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:31,120
Not so hard.

433
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:34,460
We all dream of being a child again.

434
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:36,800
Even the worst of us.

435
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:43,140
Perhaps the worst most of all.

436
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:46,640
You know what we are?

437
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:49,310
Yes, just so, the both of you!

438
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:51,640
And you!

439
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:00,980
Where is Mapache?!

440
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:11,170
All right, Pike? All right?

441
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:17,270
Hey, Tector, let's swap!

442
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,270
Come on, let's swap!

443
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:37,680
You must tell me. Where is Mapache?

444
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:40,530
Why do you wish to know?

445
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:42,530
For your father?

446
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,530
Or the whore?

447
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:51,640
Either you learn to live with it...

448
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:53,880
...or we'll leave you here.

449
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:02,040
I go with you.

450
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:35,410
You know what I'm going to do?
Steal his girl.

451
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:37,190
You are?

452
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:39,350
Here I go.

453
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:44,180
Dutch, I'm cutting in.

454
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,190
Come on, lady!

455
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:10,070
No gringos.

456
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:12,800
Only federales.

457
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:27,310
All soldiers...

458
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:29,150
...no bounty hunters in sight.

459
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:48,930
Now, what the hell is that?

460
00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:04,510
Atención!

461
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:21,200
I saw one just like it in Waco.

462
00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:23,200
Run on steam?

463
00:52:23,370 --> 00:52:25,140
No, on alcohol or gasoline.

464
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:26,640
You know what I heard?

465
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:30,710
I heard they got one of those things
up north that can fly.

466
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:33,320
That was a balloon, you damned old fool.

467
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:38,150
No, the old man's right. They've got
motors and wings, go 60 miles an hour.

468
00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:41,050
Going to use them in the war.

469
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:43,820
Let's talk to the General...

470
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,230
...about his automobile
and our extra horses.

471
00:52:47,730 --> 00:52:48,820
Nice and easy.

472
00:53:55,070 --> 00:53:57,900
Probably talking about us
behind our backs.

473
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:03,400
I'm down to about twenty in silver.

474
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:07,410
Since the Generalissimo cleaned out
this area, he ought to have a lot.

475
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:10,140
Generalissimo, hell.

476
00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:13,410
He's just another bandit
grabbing all he can for himself.

477
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:15,580
Like some others I could mention.

478
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:20,420
Not so as you'd know it.

479
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:24,320
But we ain't nothing like him.
We don't hang nobody.

480
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:31,500
I hope someday these people kick
the scum like him into their graves.

481
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:33,600
We will.

482
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:37,600
If it takes forever!

483
00:54:44,110 --> 00:54:45,170
General!

484
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:18,980
Lookie here.

485
00:55:25,490 --> 00:55:27,550
Good looking old pony, ain't he?

486
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:37,990
Boy, do you know those beauties?

487
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:22,240
Come on.

488
00:56:23,810 --> 00:56:25,080
She was my woman.

489
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:26,410
I know.

490
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,770
Sure ain't your woman no more.

491
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,670
Just look at her licking
inside that General's ear.

492
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,710
Why did he try to kill His Excellency?

493
00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:36,140
He didn't try to kill His Excellency.
He was after the girl.

494
00:57:41,330 --> 00:57:44,390
He went a little crazy
when he saw her with you.

495
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:00,570
Are you with the American Army?

496
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:08,180
No, we're not associated with anybody.

497
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:11,180
I see.

498
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:15,520
I was curious about the equipment
which you are carrying. That pistol...

499
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:19,180
...is strictly for the use
of army personnel.

500
00:58:19,530 --> 00:58:22,260
It can't be purchased or even owned...

501
00:58:22,430 --> 00:58:23,420
...legally.

502
00:58:23,930 --> 00:58:24,920
Is that so?

503
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:26,870
Weapons are my specialty.

504
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:30,700
I am Commander Frederick Mohr
of the Imperial German Army.

505
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:36,450
It would be very useful for us
if we knew of some Americans...

506
00:58:36,610 --> 00:58:40,450
...who did not share their
government's naive sentiments.

507
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:43,950
We share very few sentiments
with our government.

508
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:52,060
He's inviting us for a drink.

509
00:58:56,630 --> 00:58:57,570
Good.

510
00:58:58,570 --> 00:58:59,630
Good.

511
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:18,910
Shoot him.

512
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:25,320
Bang.

513
00:59:31,170 --> 00:59:33,760
I gave it to him, T.C.

514
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:08,870
Here?

515
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:11,130
No, no, not there!

516
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:20,970
Wait, what are you going to do?

517
01:00:22,490 --> 01:00:24,980
We got to show a little class here.

518
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:48,010
Right here!

519
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:50,170
It must be that garrison rail spur.

520
01:00:50,850 --> 01:00:54,510
It's the easiest to hit, but I must find
a way to get it out of there.

521
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:58,010
What do you think?

522
01:00:58,590 --> 01:01:00,350
Getting close to home.

523
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:03,020
Look at them gathered around the table.

524
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:08,260
Here we sit like kitchen help.

525
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:11,100
Why do you want us to hit that train?

526
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:14,100
Can't the General take over
the whole thing?

527
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:18,600
General Huerta is anxious
to better relations with the U. S...

528
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:22,380
...not to cross the border
and destroy them.

529
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:25,940
Usually these arms shipments
are kept pretty secret.

530
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:27,710
How'd you find out about this?

531
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:32,790
Mapache has a superb intelligence force
organized by my commanding officer.

532
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:34,380
Now, gentlemen...

533
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:36,290
...we are well organized.

534
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:39,620
And we'll able to pay 10,000...

535
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:41,300
...in gold.

536
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:45,960
If you're not able to do the work,
we'll find someone else.

537
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:49,070
We can do it. But we're
going to need equipment.

538
01:01:49,470 --> 01:01:51,240
Do not worry.

539
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:54,230
Our accountant will take care of it.

540
01:01:57,650 --> 01:01:59,080
My General...

541
01:01:59,580 --> 01:02:03,140
...soon you will be the best
equipped general in Mexico.

542
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:06,250
Look here...

543
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:08,650
...ain't he the one.

544
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:12,250
To the host!

545
01:02:23,770 --> 01:02:24,830
With your permission...

546
01:02:25,510 --> 01:02:26,600
...I need a bath.

547
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:30,340
With my permission,
I think you all need a bath.

548
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:33,850
I don't!

549
01:02:34,850 --> 01:02:37,620
What me and Tector need
is them women you're hogging.

550
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:39,850
Can you fix that up for us?

551
01:02:45,530 --> 01:02:46,620
Gentlemen...

552
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,290
...you will excuse me.

553
01:02:48,470 --> 01:02:50,460
I'm sure.

554
01:02:55,310 --> 01:02:56,030
Herrera.

555
01:02:56,210 --> 01:02:57,870
Let's get Angel.

556
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:12,980
I need him.

557
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:15,820
I'll give you someone
much better than that.

558
01:03:15,990 --> 01:03:18,980
If you don't mind,
I'll make my own choice.

559
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:36,510
All right.

560
01:03:36,850 --> 01:03:38,680
He is not important to me.

561
01:03:38,850 --> 01:03:39,910
Take him.

562
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:48,190
I think we'll get the wagon now.

563
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:57,190
Hey, here come our sweeties.

564
01:04:03,710 --> 01:04:05,440
Ain't them pretty?

565
01:04:05,610 --> 01:04:09,100
I don't know about yours,
Lyle, but I think...

566
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,040
...I got more than I can handle.

567
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:23,730
Hey, get out of them...

568
01:04:23,890 --> 01:04:26,730
Hey, you know what they told me?

569
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:31,130
The dons of Spain built this
over 300 years ago.

570
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:32,730
Is that right?

571
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:34,060
That's right.

572
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:37,800
I tell you Lyle, I'm all for them dons.

573
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:42,240
Let's have a little target.

574
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:45,070
She won't get away. Turn her loose.

575
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:55,760
Why not!

576
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:24,280
Tector, look at them beauties!

577
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:54,320
How in the hell
can you stand it that hot?

578
01:05:55,150 --> 01:05:58,550
I'm going to build me one of these
some day and live in it.

579
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:06,150
Hell, Lyle, look here.

580
01:06:11,570 --> 01:06:15,400
Come on, sweetheart,
let me see your teatsies.

581
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:21,230
I don't know why the hell
I didn't let them kill you.

582
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:26,350
I'm not going to steal guns for that
devil to rob and kill my people again.

583
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:28,740
Noble, noble. Very noble.

584
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:33,180
I didn't see no tears on your cheeks
when you rode in from Starbuck.

585
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:35,760
They were not my people.

586
01:06:36,190 --> 01:06:38,680
I care about my people, my village.

587
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:44,030
Listen, boy, you ride with us,
your village don't count.

588
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:46,260
If it does, you don't go along.

589
01:06:46,770 --> 01:06:48,700
Then I don't go along.

590
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:53,030
Angel, one load of guns ain't going
to stop them raiding villages.

591
01:06:54,540 --> 01:06:56,770
Think about all the money you'll have.

592
01:06:56,950 --> 01:06:59,540
Buy them a ranch.
Move them 1,000 miles.

593
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:02,440
- Buy them two or three ranches.
- One.

594
01:07:03,290 --> 01:07:04,950
A very small one.

595
01:07:05,220 --> 01:07:07,880
Don't you see? This is their land.

596
01:07:08,290 --> 01:07:10,560
And no one will drive them away.

597
01:07:10,890 --> 01:07:12,950
I'll drink to that sentiment.

598
01:07:13,130 --> 01:07:14,620
And to love.

599
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:18,890
But most of all, I'll drink to gold!

600
01:07:36,650 --> 01:07:38,480
You're a pain in the ass.

601
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:42,480
Would you give guns
to someone to kill your father...

602
01:07:42,660 --> 01:07:44,490
...or mother or brother?

603
01:07:44,930 --> 01:07:48,420
Ten thousand cuts
an awful lot of family ties.

604
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:51,330
My people have no guns.

605
01:07:52,770 --> 01:07:54,760
But with guns...

606
01:07:55,610 --> 01:07:56,940
...my people could fight.

607
01:07:59,180 --> 01:08:00,670
If I could take guns...

608
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:03,100
...I would come with you.

609
01:08:03,350 --> 01:08:08,110
How many cases of rifles did
Zamora say was in the shipment?

610
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:09,620
Sixteen.

611
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:13,850
Give him one.

612
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:27,460
All right.

613
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:32,700
One case and one case of ammo.
But you give up your share of the gold.

614
01:08:33,710 --> 01:08:34,700
I will.

615
01:08:35,140 --> 01:08:37,310
We know you will.

616
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:38,970
We've got that settled.

617
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:41,980
Why, you reprobate!

618
01:08:58,500 --> 01:08:59,900
Boys...

619
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:04,400
...I want you to meet my fiancée.

620
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:09,400
They just got engaged.

621
01:09:09,580 --> 01:09:11,070
I'm a son-of-a-bitch!

622
01:09:11,850 --> 01:09:13,680
Trot them right in, fellas.

623
01:09:14,580 --> 01:09:18,420
I'm hell on packing mules,
but I'm a delight with a pretty girl.

624
01:09:25,190 --> 01:09:28,360
You want to gamble everything on
this one shipment being attacked?

625
01:09:28,530 --> 01:09:31,090
If they're in Agua Verde,
they'll try for it.

626
01:09:31,270 --> 01:09:34,360
- Lf? What about Juárez?
- We would have heard about it.

627
01:09:34,770 --> 01:09:37,600
If they are in Agua Verde,
they will have seen Mapache.

628
01:09:37,770 --> 01:09:39,440
And who in hell is Mapache?

629
01:09:39,610 --> 01:09:42,370
A killer for Huerta who
calls himself a general.

630
01:09:42,550 --> 01:09:44,380
He's been fighting Villa and losing.

631
01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:47,950
But with enough guns, he can become
a power in northern Mexico.

632
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:50,280
Pike will try to get them for him.

633
01:09:50,450 --> 01:09:52,550
The train will be guarded with troops.

634
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:56,280
Not regular troops.
Green recruits, not worth a damn.

635
01:09:56,790 --> 01:09:59,460
I need 20 trained men, not recruits.

636
01:09:59,630 --> 01:10:00,960
And not this...

637
01:10:01,130 --> 01:10:03,460
...gutter trash you've given me.

638
01:10:04,470 --> 01:10:07,300
What you've got is 24 more days.

639
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:23,810
Never told me how you got
all tore up like that.

640
01:10:24,250 --> 01:10:26,480
I met a woman I wanted to marry.

641
01:10:43,610 --> 01:10:45,270
Your husband coming back?

642
01:10:45,510 --> 01:10:46,670
No.

643
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:48,840
He's never coming back.

644
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:55,110
But you are late.

645
01:10:55,790 --> 01:10:57,120
Two days late.

646
01:10:57,290 --> 01:10:58,510
She had a husband.

647
01:10:59,020 --> 01:11:01,460
If I had any sense, I'd have killed him.

648
01:11:04,130 --> 01:11:05,790
He wasn't around.

649
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:07,790
I got careless.

650
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,460
One night, he walked in on us.

651
01:11:10,630 --> 01:11:14,630
Caught her with the first shot,
and got me here on the second.

652
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:17,030
Then the coward turned and ran.

653
01:11:38,730 --> 01:11:39,890
Ever catch him?

654
01:11:40,660 --> 01:11:44,570
No, but there isn't an hour that
passes that I don't think about it.

655
01:11:45,740 --> 01:11:48,230
Come on! We've got a long way!

656
01:11:49,410 --> 01:11:51,740
This is our last go around, Dutch.

657
01:11:52,180 --> 01:11:54,340
This time, we do it right.

658
01:13:44,850 --> 01:13:46,290
Just do your work.

659
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:42,520
Let's go!

660
01:18:14,230 --> 01:18:16,160
They're coming!

661
01:18:29,510 --> 01:18:30,500
They're coming!

662
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:33,000
Faster!

663
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:50,530
Get over!

664
01:20:15,180 --> 01:20:17,450
Help them! Get that ramp up!

665
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:19,450
Get that horse out of here!

666
01:20:19,790 --> 01:20:22,280
Bring them out! Get them out!

667
01:20:22,450 --> 01:20:24,010
Get over there!

668
01:20:24,190 --> 01:20:27,630
Get some order there!
Get those horses!

669
01:21:03,060 --> 01:21:03,990
Hurry!

670
01:21:04,230 --> 01:21:05,660
Your horse kicked me.

671
01:21:05,830 --> 01:21:07,390
Run them up along here!

672
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,490
Where is my horse?

673
01:21:17,010 --> 01:21:18,740
Hey, we got grenades!

674
01:21:18,910 --> 01:21:21,240
- Hurry! We must go!
- Be careful!

675
01:21:21,850 --> 01:21:23,680
Let's go on this.

676
01:21:29,190 --> 01:21:30,020
Here we go.

677
01:21:33,090 --> 01:21:35,250
Line up in two columns!

678
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:39,090
Corporal, give us a hand here!

679
01:21:42,100 --> 01:21:43,760
We're all ready!

680
01:22:31,750 --> 01:22:33,080
Let's go!

681
01:22:34,750 --> 01:22:35,980
Let's go!

682
01:23:41,890 --> 01:23:43,650
Get after that horse!

683
01:23:43,820 --> 01:23:45,980
That was my horse!

684
01:23:46,230 --> 01:23:47,390
Get after him!

685
01:23:49,060 --> 01:23:50,050
Get out!

686
01:23:52,230 --> 01:23:54,830
Get that damn horse off my butt!

687
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,400
Get the horse out! The train's coming!

688
01:23:57,570 --> 01:23:58,900
- Train?
- The train's coming!

689
01:23:59,070 --> 01:23:59,730
Where?

690
01:23:59,910 --> 01:24:01,000
What train?

691
01:24:01,170 --> 01:24:02,660
I don't see any tr...

692
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:10,170
Get the goddamn horse off my foot!

693
01:24:39,210 --> 01:24:42,440
Corporal! Ride back
to the telegraph at Todos Malos...

694
01:24:42,610 --> 01:24:45,380
...and tell them the railroad deputies
robbed the train...

695
01:24:45,550 --> 01:24:46,780
...and we're in pursuit!

696
01:24:47,220 --> 01:24:48,450
Yes, sir!

697
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:55,220
Come on!

698
01:26:15,210 --> 01:26:16,640
Damn son-of-a...!

699
01:26:18,140 --> 01:26:19,870
Come on! It's lit!

700
01:26:30,390 --> 01:26:32,050
Get them horses going!

701
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:53,900
Don't shoot! It's the army!

702
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:04,910
Come on!

703
01:28:08,420 --> 01:28:09,910
Let's go!

704
01:28:14,590 --> 01:28:16,420
Come on, you lazy bastard!

705
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:18,760
I'm coming, damn it!

706
01:28:35,510 --> 01:28:36,950
Is it all right?

707
01:28:38,620 --> 01:28:40,180
Where will they meet us?

708
01:28:40,690 --> 01:28:42,520
Agua Verde or before.

709
01:28:42,690 --> 01:28:46,620
But when we do meet them,
don't expect any open arms.

710
01:28:46,790 --> 01:28:49,280
Least we won't have to worry about Deke.

711
01:28:50,530 --> 01:28:53,860
Not after riding a half a case
of dynamite into the river.

712
01:28:54,130 --> 01:28:58,470
Don't expect him to stay there.
He'll be along and you know it.

713
01:31:14,770 --> 01:31:17,830
I would like to get hold of that
fool horse of mine.

714
01:31:18,280 --> 01:31:21,180
Some Mex kid's probably
riding him home right now.

715
01:31:21,350 --> 01:31:24,280
I don't see how I could've
lost both my boots.

716
01:31:24,950 --> 01:31:26,850
They were hard to get on.

717
01:31:27,020 --> 01:31:28,610
The river sucked them off.

718
01:31:28,790 --> 01:31:30,850
That dynamite helped some.

719
01:31:31,020 --> 01:31:34,960
Maybe the same kid riding
T.C.'s horse is wearing your boots.

720
01:31:36,190 --> 01:31:37,630
You stupid bastards!

721
01:31:38,300 --> 01:31:40,460
Why did you fire at the soldiers?

722
01:31:41,030 --> 01:31:42,690
Huey started firing at them.

723
01:31:43,030 --> 01:31:44,370
I tried to stop him.

724
01:31:44,540 --> 01:31:45,870
One of the bandits...

725
01:31:46,040 --> 01:31:47,300
Don't blame me!

726
01:31:47,470 --> 01:31:48,200
Liar!

727
01:31:48,710 --> 01:31:50,300
Shut your mouths!

728
01:31:51,210 --> 01:31:52,370
Are we following?

729
01:31:52,540 --> 01:31:54,810
Yes, or you'll face a firing squad.

730
01:31:57,880 --> 01:31:59,710
Come on, T.C.!

731
01:32:01,890 --> 01:32:03,650
My hair's wet!

732
01:32:40,360 --> 01:32:43,260
Impossible! We have
no arms or ammunition.

733
01:33:49,160 --> 01:33:50,590
They assaulted the train!

734
01:33:50,930 --> 01:33:52,330
They got the guns.

735
01:33:55,830 --> 01:33:57,170
We must go!

736
01:33:58,770 --> 01:34:01,930
Take the necessary people and
take the road to Agua Verde.

737
01:34:02,110 --> 01:34:05,440
Convince them to give you the guns.
I wait at the village.

738
01:35:31,930 --> 01:35:33,760
He's still heading east.

739
01:35:36,870 --> 01:35:39,360
Are they bluffing, or did they miss it?

740
01:35:44,010 --> 01:35:45,840
I'd say they missed it.

741
01:35:46,240 --> 01:35:47,400
Take a look.

742
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:52,180
There's only five left.

743
01:36:00,530 --> 01:36:01,920
Hell, we lost them.

744
01:36:02,090 --> 01:36:03,250
I don't see how.

745
01:36:03,430 --> 01:36:06,590
Unless it was in the big valley
where the ground was hard.

746
01:36:06,770 --> 01:36:11,260
There was but one way they could take
a wagon out of there, and this is it.

747
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:13,030
They didn't take it out.

748
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:16,200
We haven't lost them.
I could point to them right now.

749
01:36:16,710 --> 01:36:18,370
Sit still, damn it!

750
01:36:18,710 --> 01:36:21,040
You think they aren't watching us?

751
01:36:21,550 --> 01:36:24,210
They know what this is about.
What do I have?

752
01:36:24,550 --> 01:36:27,540
Nothing but you
chicken-stealing gutter trash...

753
01:36:27,720 --> 01:36:29,780
...with not even 60 rounds between you.

754
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:31,780
We're after men.

755
01:36:32,290 --> 01:36:34,550
And I wish to God I was with them.

756
01:36:35,130 --> 01:36:38,890
The next time you make a mistake,
I'll ride off and let you die.

757
01:36:40,970 --> 01:36:41,730
Come on.

758
01:36:50,250 --> 01:36:53,240
I never figured they'd
come down here after us.

759
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:56,020
How much you reckon
we could be worth?

760
01:36:56,090 --> 01:36:58,680
Depends on how hungry they are.

761
01:37:02,260 --> 01:37:05,090
You better stay here
and look out for big hats.

762
01:37:05,260 --> 01:37:07,750
I'll go and start rigging the fireworks.

763
01:37:07,930 --> 01:37:09,090
All right.

764
01:37:14,040 --> 01:37:17,030
Get that case of explosives
off the back there!

765
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:21,540
Hand me down those blasting caps.

766
01:37:29,050 --> 01:37:31,110
What you doing with the dynamite?

767
01:37:32,790 --> 01:37:36,620
I figure Mapache will try to take
this load without paying for it...

768
01:37:36,790 --> 01:37:38,390
...and shoot us as well.

769
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:43,730
The thing to change his mind
is something happening to the guns.

770
01:37:43,900 --> 01:37:46,130
I'm making sure something could happen.

771
01:37:46,300 --> 01:37:48,790
Hey, Pike, take a look at this.

772
01:37:49,910 --> 01:37:51,070
Can you handle that?

773
01:37:53,410 --> 01:37:56,470
What I don't know,
I sure as hell am going to learn.

774
01:39:06,220 --> 01:39:08,380
My people are here for their guns.

775
01:39:13,820 --> 01:39:16,050
You were supposed to be guarding us.

776
01:39:16,230 --> 01:39:18,060
I never heard them,
didn't even see them.

777
01:39:32,680 --> 01:39:36,840
They apologize and ask you
to forgive them for their lack of trust.

778
01:39:37,410 --> 01:39:40,080
But only by caution
do they remain alive.

779
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:47,750
Tell them not to break that fuse.

780
01:39:50,360 --> 01:39:52,260
These people from your village?

781
01:39:52,430 --> 01:39:55,190
They are part of the village,
but not from it.

782
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:59,760
They are puro Indio and
these mountains belong to them.

783
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:25,620
I'd say those fellows know
how to handle themselves.

784
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:27,630
They've fought Apaches
for a 1,000 years.

785
01:40:27,730 --> 01:40:29,220
That's a sure way to learn.

786
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:33,740
If they ever get armed, this whole
country will go up in smoke.

787
01:40:33,900 --> 01:40:36,390
That it will, son. That it will.

788
01:40:37,310 --> 01:40:39,900
They made damn fools out of us.

789
01:40:41,640 --> 01:40:46,580
A man can't sleep with both eyes closed
for fear of getting his throat cut.

790
01:40:46,750 --> 01:40:47,650
Where were you?

791
01:40:48,150 --> 01:40:49,810
You listen to me.

792
01:40:49,990 --> 01:40:54,920
If you get up and help once in a while,
I wouldn't got caught so easy.

793
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:13,600
With the new guns and ammunition,
this couldn't have happened.

794
01:41:40,140 --> 01:41:42,370
Swing your leaders wide, old man!

795
01:41:42,540 --> 01:41:44,700
- Bring them on!
- Come on!

796
01:41:58,990 --> 01:42:00,480
Come on, horse!

797
01:42:14,340 --> 01:42:15,400
Hold up!

798
01:42:15,570 --> 01:42:16,900
Whoa there!

799
01:42:19,340 --> 01:42:20,330
Mapache's?

800
01:42:21,010 --> 01:42:22,670
Let's hope they aren't Villa's.

801
01:42:36,590 --> 01:42:38,250
We are friends.

802
01:42:38,530 --> 01:42:40,590
We are from el General Mapache.

803
01:42:41,200 --> 01:42:42,930
Tell the one in front to come here.

804
01:42:43,100 --> 01:42:44,360
Alone.

805
01:42:50,110 --> 01:42:51,600
I am coming.

806
01:42:51,940 --> 01:42:53,770
I am your friend, remember?

807
01:42:57,110 --> 01:42:58,550
We are friends.

808
01:42:58,710 --> 01:43:00,050
All of us.

809
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:03,940
I bring you love and affection
from el General.

810
01:43:07,960 --> 01:43:10,620
You bring the guns with you?

811
01:43:13,230 --> 01:43:15,290
What bravery you have done!

812
01:43:16,300 --> 01:43:18,790
I am to escort you to the General.

813
01:43:20,640 --> 01:43:22,230
Tell him to come closer.

814
01:43:22,410 --> 01:43:23,390
I hear.

815
01:43:24,470 --> 01:43:26,570
I am coming, my friend.

816
01:43:30,410 --> 01:43:31,470
Recognize this?

817
01:43:40,660 --> 01:43:43,920
Any trouble, no guns for the General.

818
01:43:50,500 --> 01:43:51,990
Very smart!

819
01:43:52,170 --> 01:43:55,430
That's very smart for you
damn gringos.

820
01:43:55,610 --> 01:43:57,440
So nobody can rob the guns.

821
01:43:58,170 --> 01:43:59,330
Nobody.

822
01:43:59,610 --> 01:44:01,270
I am not afraid.

823
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:03,110
They are not afraid.

824
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:05,340
You blow up the wagon, you die.

825
01:44:05,510 --> 01:44:07,110
Or we kill you pretty soon.

826
01:44:08,120 --> 01:44:09,610
But we are amigos.

827
01:44:09,950 --> 01:44:11,280
Show them, boys.

828
01:44:24,200 --> 01:44:25,960
Start the ball, Tector.

829
01:44:35,380 --> 01:44:37,710
Please cut the fuse.

830
01:44:43,220 --> 01:44:44,210
Please.

831
01:45:19,190 --> 01:45:22,350
El General waits
in Agua Verde to meet with you.

832
01:45:22,530 --> 01:45:26,020
Tell the General one of us
will be there to trade tomorrow.

833
01:45:26,760 --> 01:45:28,250
Any trouble...

834
01:45:28,600 --> 01:45:29,590
...no guns.

835
01:45:44,550 --> 01:45:46,210
Damn gringos!

836
01:46:21,580 --> 01:46:24,140
Get them up there! Get them over!

837
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:34,590
Get up there! Get up!

838
01:47:00,190 --> 01:47:01,450
You bring the guns?

839
01:47:02,190 --> 01:47:04,180
Don't worry, we've got them.

840
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:06,020
Hidden.

841
01:47:08,200 --> 01:47:11,530
When I get my share of the gold,
2,500 dollars' worth...

842
01:47:11,700 --> 01:47:14,030
...I'll tell you where four cases are.

843
01:47:15,370 --> 01:47:18,030
The others are waiting
for me at the wagon.

844
01:47:18,370 --> 01:47:21,140
If I don't show up pretty
quick, they'll blow it.

845
01:47:21,640 --> 01:47:25,310
You fix it goddamn good, no?
You fool me.

846
01:47:26,050 --> 01:47:28,980
Our accountant will pay you immediately.

847
01:47:31,150 --> 01:47:32,810
When do we get our guns?

848
01:47:32,990 --> 01:47:36,320
The quicker I get back,
the quicker you get the next load.

849
01:47:40,500 --> 01:47:41,720
Open it up.

850
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:56,240
Up the arroyo, about two miles...

851
01:47:56,410 --> 01:47:58,850
...you'll find three cases of rifles...

852
01:47:59,080 --> 01:48:01,850
...and one case of ammunition
hidden in the bush.

853
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:12,020
I understand you have a machine gun.

854
01:48:14,600 --> 01:48:17,590
Our contract called for
16 cases of rifles...

855
01:48:17,770 --> 01:48:20,200
...and ammunition for $10,000.

856
01:48:20,370 --> 01:48:22,030
Not a machine gun.

857
01:48:25,540 --> 01:48:27,770
That's our present to the General.

858
01:48:30,380 --> 01:48:32,870
Gringo, you fight with Mapache.

859
01:48:37,290 --> 01:48:38,720
I'll think about it.

860
01:48:40,620 --> 01:48:43,060
In case he don't find them...

861
01:48:43,290 --> 01:48:44,550
Go.

862
01:48:44,890 --> 01:48:46,560
I trust him.

863
01:49:11,920 --> 01:49:13,750
Why don't you stir up some grub?

864
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:15,820
Why don't you go to hell?

865
01:49:29,170 --> 01:49:30,330
Shit!

866
01:49:32,680 --> 01:49:33,840
Damn it!

867
01:49:35,340 --> 01:49:39,010
Damn it, Pike must've found you
under a rock.

868
01:49:39,180 --> 01:49:40,340
You whip me?

869
01:49:41,120 --> 01:49:42,170
Nope.

870
01:49:42,350 --> 01:49:45,180
But you better hope
I don't get riled enough...

871
01:49:45,350 --> 01:49:47,790
...to dog you when this is over.

872
01:49:48,120 --> 01:49:51,150
You're not going to get a chance
to dry gulch me, old man.

873
01:49:51,790 --> 01:49:53,520
We'll see.

874
01:49:54,300 --> 01:49:55,730
We'll see.

875
01:49:56,970 --> 01:49:58,520
Pike's coming!

876
01:50:04,310 --> 01:50:06,710
He's got it. Carrying gold.

877
01:50:08,710 --> 01:50:10,140
Any trouble?

878
01:50:10,310 --> 01:50:12,300
Just from carrying this weight.

879
01:50:14,380 --> 01:50:16,650
Pike, I want to go next.

880
01:50:16,820 --> 01:50:19,880
You and Lyle take the next load,
with the machine gun.

881
01:50:20,060 --> 01:50:24,390
Then Angel and Dutch. Freddie,
you follow and get the pack horses.

882
01:50:31,670 --> 01:50:35,330
It must be mounted on a tripod!

883
01:50:36,170 --> 01:50:38,830
It must be mounted on a tripod.

884
01:51:03,430 --> 01:51:05,260
They're crazy bastards!

885
01:52:23,180 --> 01:52:25,170
Put it on the tripod!

886
01:52:47,800 --> 01:52:50,640
We brought the last of it, General.

887
01:53:10,990 --> 01:53:12,820
At the arroyo, in the wagon.

888
01:53:21,400 --> 01:53:23,670
Keep the wagon, we'll keep the horses.

889
01:53:26,410 --> 01:53:29,070
How many cases did you take
from the train?

890
01:53:29,850 --> 01:53:33,410
Sixteen cases of rifles.
We lost one on the trail.

891
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:35,080
He stole it.

892
01:53:36,080 --> 01:53:38,750
The mother of the girl
he killed told me so.

893
01:54:38,350 --> 01:54:40,340
I'm wasting time here.

894
01:54:50,190 --> 01:54:52,290
He's a thief. You take care of him.

895
01:55:49,520 --> 01:55:51,350
Well, he had guts.

896
01:55:52,090 --> 01:55:53,750
We're lucky he didn't talk.

897
01:55:54,360 --> 01:55:57,020
He played his string right to the end.

898
01:56:04,870 --> 01:56:08,600
Her own mama turned him in
like some kind of Judas.

899
01:56:08,870 --> 01:56:10,770
Sykes says we should go after him.

900
01:56:10,940 --> 01:56:14,770
How will we do that?
They got guns and 200 men.

901
01:56:15,380 --> 01:56:16,710
No way.

902
01:56:17,380 --> 01:56:19,110
No way at all.

903
01:56:20,050 --> 01:56:21,540
Is that Sykes?

904
01:56:47,810 --> 01:56:49,070
Mapache!

905
01:56:52,650 --> 01:56:53,640
Thornton.

906
01:56:58,320 --> 01:56:59,650
I got him.

907
01:57:03,490 --> 01:57:04,480
They got Freddie.

908
01:57:06,660 --> 01:57:08,090
He looks hit pretty bad.

909
01:57:08,430 --> 01:57:10,590
Damn that Deke Thornton to hell!

910
01:57:11,170 --> 01:57:13,830
What would you do? He gave his word.

911
01:57:14,100 --> 01:57:16,260
Gave his word to a railroad.

912
01:57:16,440 --> 01:57:17,270
It's his word!

913
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:20,840
That ain't what counts!
It's who you give it to!

914
01:57:27,680 --> 01:57:31,280
We can stay up here and
kick hell out of them!

915
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:37,120
No, we're running out of water.

916
01:57:38,360 --> 01:57:40,120
Run for the border?

917
01:57:42,030 --> 01:57:44,970
They'd follow us every step of the way.
I know Thornton.

918
01:57:45,800 --> 01:57:47,790
I'm tired of being hunted.

919
01:57:49,040 --> 01:57:52,630
Let's go to Agua Verde.
Let the General take care of those boys.

920
01:57:53,980 --> 01:57:54,810
You're crazy.

921
01:57:57,150 --> 01:57:59,710
He would just as soon
kill us as break wind.

922
01:57:59,980 --> 01:58:04,710
He's so tickled with the guns, he'll be
celebrating and happy to do us a favor.

923
01:58:05,050 --> 01:58:07,390
Thornton won't follow us in there.

924
01:58:08,560 --> 01:58:10,720
While they're picking over Freddie...

925
01:58:10,890 --> 01:58:13,880
...we'll find a back trail
and head for town.

926
01:58:17,400 --> 01:58:19,060
What about our gold?

927
01:58:26,510 --> 01:58:29,000
We'll take one sack to pay our way.

928
01:58:29,850 --> 01:58:30,830
Bury the rest.

929
01:58:34,680 --> 01:58:35,840
Together.

930
01:58:55,200 --> 01:58:56,430
Look out, Jess!

931
01:59:03,950 --> 01:59:06,940
Lots of blood, then it stops.
No tracks.

932
01:59:07,280 --> 01:59:08,940
Ten dollars says he's dead by now.

933
01:59:09,120 --> 01:59:11,550
Take us a day to find him if he is.

934
01:59:11,950 --> 01:59:14,220
If not, he has a gun on us right now.

935
01:59:19,290 --> 01:59:20,730
Let's find the others.

936
01:59:20,900 --> 01:59:23,560
Just leave him here? He's worth money.

937
01:59:24,300 --> 01:59:28,290
Ride out tomorrow, if you can stay
on your horse, and watch the buzzards.

938
01:59:28,470 --> 01:59:29,960
They'll show you.

939
01:59:30,310 --> 01:59:31,740
What if he ain't dead?

940
01:59:32,640 --> 01:59:33,630
That's your problem.

941
01:59:34,140 --> 01:59:35,470
Let's go!

942
02:01:07,400 --> 02:01:08,990
I hate to see that.

943
02:01:09,340 --> 02:01:10,830
No more than I do.

944
02:01:34,200 --> 02:01:37,030
Welcome amigos!
You come for your friend, no?

945
02:01:47,380 --> 02:01:49,040
I want to buy him back.

946
02:01:54,120 --> 02:01:56,710
I don't think he looks worth too much.

947
02:02:03,630 --> 02:02:05,560
I don't think he'll live long.

948
02:02:05,890 --> 02:02:07,730
I'll give half my share.

949
02:02:07,900 --> 02:02:11,390
I need no gold.
And I don't sell this one.

950
02:02:11,570 --> 02:02:13,300
You've had your fun with him.

951
02:02:13,470 --> 02:02:15,730
El General is happy with the guns.

952
02:02:16,640 --> 02:02:18,570
Why don't you go get a drink?

953
02:02:18,740 --> 02:02:21,470
Enjoy yourself.
There are women everywhere.

954
02:02:26,080 --> 02:02:28,140
Don't be foolish and change his mood.

955
02:03:10,960 --> 02:03:12,950
Son-of-a-bitch!

956
02:03:25,140 --> 02:03:26,540
Why not?

957
02:03:41,320 --> 02:03:42,880
There ain't nobody here!

958
02:03:43,060 --> 02:03:46,650
There's wagon tracks
and somebody was here!

959
02:03:46,830 --> 02:03:48,230
They ain't here now!

960
02:03:54,570 --> 02:03:56,400
Army patrol!

961
02:03:56,910 --> 02:03:58,240
Coming this way!

962
02:06:33,160 --> 02:06:34,990
You said dos for two!

963
02:06:35,160 --> 02:06:37,390
Here's your dos
and one to grow on.

964
02:06:37,570 --> 02:06:40,000
That's all you'll get out of me.

965
02:07:12,200 --> 02:07:13,760
Let's go.

966
02:07:24,950 --> 02:07:26,440
Why not?

967
02:11:11,110 --> 02:11:12,270
What do you want?

968
02:11:17,610 --> 02:11:18,940
We want Angel.

969
02:11:20,680 --> 02:11:22,620
You want Angel, no?

970
02:11:22,780 --> 02:11:23,940
All right.

971
02:11:24,120 --> 02:11:26,110
I'm going to give him to you.

972
02:15:28,660 --> 02:15:29,320
Bitch!

973
02:15:54,020 --> 02:15:55,850
Come on, you lazy bastard!

974
02:16:31,790 --> 02:16:33,890
Give them hell, Pike!

975
02:16:40,300 --> 02:16:41,890
No, Pike!

976
02:17:36,960 --> 02:17:38,360
Look at them.

977
02:17:39,130 --> 02:17:40,460
Come on.

978
02:17:40,630 --> 02:17:43,790
- Come on, T.C.! This is fine!
- Wait for me!

979
02:17:43,960 --> 02:17:46,360
Come on, let's get all the guns.

980
02:17:47,200 --> 02:17:49,690
This is just like a big old picnic!

981
02:17:49,970 --> 02:17:51,870
Here's a rifle for you.

982
02:18:21,070 --> 02:18:22,560
He's got a gun.

983
02:18:27,010 --> 02:18:28,570
It's them!

984
02:18:29,680 --> 02:18:31,170
It's the Gorches!

985
02:18:31,350 --> 02:18:33,840
Come on, get up there, Coffer.
Come on.

986
02:18:34,180 --> 02:18:35,670
Mr. Thornton...

987
02:18:35,850 --> 02:18:37,340
...it's them.

988
02:18:37,520 --> 02:18:39,010
It is them.

989
02:18:42,520 --> 02:18:45,690
This boy's got gold in his teeth.
Let me see your knife.

990
02:18:45,860 --> 02:18:48,020
- Here.
- Let me see your knife!

991
02:18:51,930 --> 02:18:53,020
Should we load up?

992
02:18:54,370 --> 02:18:56,530
Do we wait for Jess or meet him?

993
02:18:56,700 --> 02:19:01,270
If he's waiting for buzzards to lead
him to Sykes, he's got a long wait.

994
02:19:01,440 --> 02:19:02,880
Look! We got them all.

995
02:19:03,880 --> 02:19:05,780
There he is.

996
02:19:06,050 --> 02:19:07,450
There's Pike.

997
02:19:07,610 --> 02:19:10,880
There, you ain't so damned
much now, are you, Mr. Pike?

998
02:19:18,460 --> 02:19:19,950
You ain't coming?

999
02:19:26,630 --> 02:19:28,620
Maybe we should wait for Jess.

1000
02:19:30,240 --> 02:19:32,470
No, we pick him up on the way.

1001
02:19:32,640 --> 02:19:34,570
I want to get out of this damn place.

1002
02:19:34,640 --> 02:19:37,700
Anyway these boys'll
start going ripe by tomorrow.

1003
02:19:37,810 --> 02:19:39,300
We got to move.

1004
02:19:42,580 --> 02:19:45,580
"I went to the river and
I couldn't get across.

1005
02:19:45,750 --> 02:19:48,650
"Singing polly wolly doodle all the day,

1006
02:19:48,820 --> 02:19:51,920
"I jumped on a buzzard 'cause
I thought he was a horse,

1007
02:19:52,090 --> 02:19:54,750
"Singing polly wolly doodle all the day.

1008
02:19:54,930 --> 02:19:56,490
"Fare thee well..."

1009
02:21:28,420 --> 02:21:31,360
- Didn't expect to find you here.
- Why not?

1010
02:21:32,030 --> 02:21:33,580
I sent them back.

1011
02:21:34,260 --> 02:21:35,850
That's all I said I'd do.

1012
02:21:36,360 --> 02:21:37,850
They didn't get far.

1013
02:21:38,770 --> 02:21:39,750
I figured.

1014
02:21:43,270 --> 02:21:45,100
What are your plans?

1015
02:21:46,370 --> 02:21:48,030
Drift around down here.

1016
02:21:48,210 --> 02:21:49,540
Try to stay out of jail.

1017
02:21:50,940 --> 02:21:54,110
Well, me and the boys here...

1018
02:21:54,550 --> 02:21:55,710
...got work to do.

1019
02:22:00,450 --> 02:22:01,610
Want to come?

1020
02:22:03,890 --> 02:22:06,290
Ain't like it used to be, but...

1021
02:22:06,790 --> 02:22:08,060
...it'll do.
