For every mile of track that
a railroad would build,

<i>Congress would

<i>The land grants that Congress provides</i>

into Sioux territory.</i>

<i>Crazy Horse knows it's up to him</i>

<i>against an enemy with

<i>But he's confident he'll prevail,</i>

322
00:22:54,369 --> 00:22:58,010
<i>thanks to a powerful
vision he had in his youth.</i>

323
00:23:04,046 --> 00:23:06,947
<i>Karl Jacoby: Crazy Horse,
as a young man, had a vision.</i>

(cawing)

326
00:23:14,055 --> 00:23:17,022
<i>And in this vision he sees
that whenever he's in battle,</i>

327
00:23:17,124 --> 00:23:20,192
he's very safe from the enemy and
the enemy can never hurt him.

328
00:23:25,867 --> 00:23:28,800
<i>And in essence he could be protected</i>

329
00:23:28,902 --> 00:23:31,603

enemy might do to him.

330

<i>Narrator: Emboldened by his vision,</i>

331

<i>and one of these people is Crazy Horse.</i>

334
00:23:56,228 --> 00:23:58,295
It's obviously a very
risky position to be in

335
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:01,764

yourself very close to the US Army.

<i>Narrator: It's a tactic
known as riding the brave line.</i>

349
00:25:01,924 --> 00:25:05,825
<i>And it exposes the
soldiers' greatest weakness.</i>

<i>Grant realizes the only
way to defeat the Indians</i>

373

<i>is to send his best

<i>a man stationed 2,000

<i>Anne Collier: George
Armstrong Custer was very flamboyant.</i>

<i>He had flowing blond hair.</i>

380
00:27:47,078 --> 00:27:48,411
<i>Some say he curled it himself.</i>

381
00:27:48,546 --> 00:27:52,347
He wore a signature
costume, if you will,

382

that he called a uniform.

383

<i>He had a red handkerchief, shiny boots,</i>

384

<i>and a broad-rimmed hat.</i>

385
00:28:05,329 --> 00:28:08,463
And he just showed
himself to be superior to others.

386
00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:22,275
Where did you acquire that insignia
on your uniform, soldier?

387

Gentlemen, we have a
celebrity in our midst.

Lieutenant, why are you falling back?

<i>In the first 80 years

<i>there was not a

00:34:48,818 --> 00:34:51,386
- You fought at Richmond.
- No, I didn't.

468
00:34:51,387 --> 00:34:53,253
- Don't you shake your head at me.
- Jesse.

469
00:34:57,091 --> 00:34:59,425
You're the man who shot Bill Anderson.

470
00:35:01,195 --> 00:35:03,162
<i>Gardner: The Civil War made Jesse James.</i>

471
00:35:03,297 --> 00:35:05,999
<i>He killed men, he saw men killed.</i>

472
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:10,302
Seeing death every day
changes the way you look at life.

473
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:13,705
<i>Jesse mistook the teller</i>

474
00:35:13,841 --> 00:35:17,342
<i>for the murderer of his
leader during the Civil War.</i>

475
00:35:17,444 --> 00:35:19,578
I found you, you son of a bitch.

476
00:35:22,182 --> 00:35:24,616
(shouts)

477
00:35:24,752 --> 00:35:26,192
We still need him to open the vault.

478
00:35:30,957 --> 00:35:32,723
Bill Anderson was my friend.

479
00:35:32,825 --> 00:35:33,591
(gunshot)

480
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:37,127
God damn it, Jesse. On the floor!

481
00:35:41,267 --> 00:35:42,833
<i>Frank: Come on, Jesse, we got to go.</i>

482
00:35:42,936 --> 00:35:44,378
<i>Come on, now! Come on.</i>

483
00:35:45,905 --> 00:35:47,637
<i>Gardner: That revolver shot</i>

484
00:35:47,773 --> 00:35:49,600
<i>is somewhat of a release.</i>

485
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:53,743
When Jesse fires that gun,

486
00:35:53,879 --> 00:35:58,081
there's a welled-up bitterness
that's been boiling for years.

487
00:35:58,183 --> 00:36:01,685
<i>He still has the memories he witnessed
personally during the war.</i>

488
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,300
<i>Lots of his friends have been killed.</i>

489
00:36:05,122 --> 00:36:06,622
Jesse refused to forget.

490
00:36:06,724 --> 00:36:09,524
<i>A lot of his makeup was revenge.</i>

491
00:36:11,028 --> 00:36:12,426
Come on, Jesse. We got to go.

492
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,196
Jesse, come on. Come on, now.

493
00:36:14,364 --> 00:36:16,065
Get, boys, get.

494
00:36:29,613 --> 00:36:30,912
(clicks tongue) Come on.

495
00:36:32,749 --> 00:36:35,249
Come on.

496
00:36:46,698 --> 00:36:49,232
(hammer clicks, gunshot)

497
00:36:49,334 --> 00:36:51,568
<i>Narrator: Jesse
James has just pulled off</i>

498
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:54,137
<i>one of the first bank
robberies in America,</i>

499
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:57,908
<i>leaving one man dead and
earning the ex-Confederate</i>

500
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:00,007
<i>his first victory against the North.</i>

501
00:37:00,133 --> 00:37:02,244
A lot of the guys who became outlaws,

502
00:37:02,379 --> 00:37:03,918
Jesse James and so forth, they were

503
00:37:03,943 --> 00:37:05,438
all part of the Confederate Army.

504
00:37:05,549 --> 00:37:08,050
<i>And when the Union won that war,</i>

505
00:37:08,152 --> 00:37:09,819
robbing banks was their way

506
00:37:09,921 --> 00:37:13,422
of continuing the
fight of the Confederacy.

507
00:37:13,524 --> 00:37:16,191
<i>Narrator: The crime makes
headlines across the state,</i>

508
00:37:16,327 --> 00:37:19,861
<i>turning Jesse into a wanted criminal.</i>

509
00:37:19,997 --> 00:37:21,796
All right, it's on you, Frank.

510
00:37:21,898 --> 00:37:23,531
There it is. (laughs)

511
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:27,301
It's a good day to be
Frank James, you know.

512
00:37:27,437 --> 00:37:31,039
<i>Sutherland: Jesse James certainly
had a very specific idea.</i>

513
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:32,887
He was going to take
the money that he felt

514
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:34,511
was taken from him during the Civil War.

515
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:37,011
<i>The press got wind of that.</i>

516
00:37:37,146 --> 00:37:39,546
And once they started reading
their own stuff,

517
00:37:39,682 --> 00:37:42,049
they were, "Yeah, I'm
right. You know, I was questioning

518
00:37:42,184 --> 00:37:44,584
whether or not I should have robbed
that bank, but now I know I'm right."

519
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,286
(laughs)

520
00:37:46,421 --> 00:37:48,421
<i>Narrator: With his reputation growing,</i>

521
00:37:48,524 --> 00:37:51,358
<i>Jesse James is fanning the
flames of rebellion in the South.</i>

522
00:37:55,563 --> 00:37:57,630
<i>Over 400 miles away,</i>

523
00:37:57,766 --> 00:38:00,967
<i>the US government is
dealing with an even greater problem</i>

524
00:38:01,102 --> 00:38:02,301
<i>than southern uprisings...</i>

525
00:38:06,041 --> 00:38:09,174
<i>as Indian attacks by
warriors like Crazy Horse</i>

526
00:38:09,276 --> 00:38:11,643
<i>are slowing down western progress.</i>

527
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:19,384
<i>But General Ulysses S.
Grant has an answer...</i>

528
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:23,555
<i>Civil War hero George Armstrong Custer.</i>

529
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:31,528
Grant was quite happy with
the performance of Custer.

530
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:37,168
<i>Custer was one of the great
heroes during the Civil War.</i>

531
00:38:37,269 --> 00:38:39,469
<i>He was also willing to
do whatever was necessary</i>

532
00:38:39,638 --> 00:38:42,285
to deal with the Indian issue right now.

533
00:38:44,176 --> 00:38:45,942
<i>Narrator: For
Custer, it's the opportunity</i>

534
00:38:46,078 --> 00:38:49,579
<i>he's been waiting for to
step back into the spotlight.</i>

535
00:38:56,088 --> 00:38:59,089
<i>For months, Custer has
been hunting bands of Indians</i>

536
00:38:59,191 --> 00:39:00,923
<i>across the southern plains...</i>

537
00:39:01,058 --> 00:39:03,525
Halt!

538
00:39:03,627 --> 00:39:06,061
<i>But hasn't been able to track them down.</i>

539
00:39:12,737 --> 00:39:15,420
<i>Gardner: I think Custer
had the same ambitions</i>

540
00:39:15,536 --> 00:39:18,388
that any long-term military
officer had.

541
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:20,428
That was to advance in rank.

542
00:39:20,542 --> 00:39:24,411
<i>Advance in rank and to
win laurels, win glory.</i>

543
00:39:24,513 --> 00:39:27,215
<i>That was hard to do in
the post-Civil War West.</i>

544
00:39:27,316 --> 00:39:30,484
<i>I mean, you weren't
meeting a foe that was lined up</i>

545
00:39:30,586 --> 00:39:32,353
with 10,000 men on the field of battle.

546
00:39:32,488 --> 00:39:35,188
You were meeting a very elusive foe.

547
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:39,292
<i>So I think Custer was frustrated often</i>

548
00:39:39,394 --> 00:39:43,130
<i>with what he wanted to do,
and I think he wanted glory.</i>

549
00:39:48,637 --> 00:39:52,204
<i>Narrator: Finally,
Custer catches a break.</i>

550
00:40:08,388 --> 00:40:12,290
<i>His regiment discovers a
band of Cheyenne Indians</i>

551
00:40:12,425 --> 00:40:14,325
<i>camped near the Washita River</i>

552
00:40:14,494 --> 00:40:17,361
<i>suspected of
attacking settlers and troops.</i>

553
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,565
Get the men ready.

554
00:40:21,668 --> 00:40:22,633
Half an hour.

555
00:40:22,669 --> 00:40:26,670
I want to hit them with
everything we've got.

556
00:40:31,076 --> 00:40:32,709
You have your orders.

557
00:40:32,812 --> 00:40:34,411
Yes, sir.

558
00:40:43,421 --> 00:40:47,156
<i>Narrator: Desperate for
another chance at greatness,</i>

559
00:40:47,292 --> 00:40:49,926
<i>Custer prepares a surprise attack.</i>

560
00:40:54,632 --> 00:40:57,533
<i>Jacoby: Custer is quite
consciously, I think, very aggressive</i>

561
00:40:57,635 --> 00:41:00,035
<i>in his war against Indians</i>

562
00:41:00,137 --> 00:41:02,408
because he's really
trying to reclaim the glory

563
00:41:02,518 --> 00:41:04,436
that he experienced during the Civil War

564
00:41:04,565 --> 00:41:06,942
<i>when he was this American hero.</i>

565
00:41:17,753 --> 00:41:21,681
<i>Narrator: It's only been three
years since the Civil War ended.</i>

566
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:28,128
<i>But now with Custer
riding into a battle for glory...</i>

567
00:41:32,001 --> 00:41:34,901
<i>and Jesse James inciting
a rebellion in the South...</i>

568
00:41:37,305 --> 00:41:41,774
<i>America is on the brink of
fighting a two-front war.</i>
