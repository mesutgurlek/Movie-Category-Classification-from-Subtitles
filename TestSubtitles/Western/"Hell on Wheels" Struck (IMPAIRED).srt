00:34:38,662 --> 00:34:41,232
We provide our loved ones
with food, money...

494
00:34:42,402 --> 00:34:44,938
Everything he might need in the afterlife.

495
00:34:46,007 --> 00:34:47,607
But, if there is no one to care for him,

496
00:34:49,376 --> 00:34:52,078
he wanders as a <i>ngor gui.</i>

497
00:34:53,414 --> 00:34:55,147
Hungry ghost... Forever.

That's, uh, Yao Pak Na.

500
00:35:03,257 --> 00:35:05,527
He's got a wife and
four children in Yunping.

501
00:35:08,096 --> 00:35:11,296
So, as long as he's here, they will
never be able to care for him.

502
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:16,930
If living Chinese can't have
the same respect as white men,

503
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:21,370
maybe the dead can.

504
00:35:34,985 --> 00:35:37,884
Honor the ones who gave
their lives for your road,

505
00:35:40,355 --> 00:35:42,090
I think they will go back to work.

506
00:36:04,948 --> 00:36:07,681
Release my shipment,
there will be no bloodshed.

507

- Come closer, Chang.

508
00:36:10,121 --> 00:36:11,353
I can't hear you.

509
00:36:22,967 --> 00:36:26,970
The Chinese will not return to
work until our demands are met.

Now on...

517
00:37:44,874 --> 00:37:46,610
Railroad carries the cost of freight

518
00:37:46,645 --> 00:37:49,311
to ship the Chinese bodies back
to their home villages in China.

519
00:37:50,779 --> 00:37:53,249
Well, they come here
by the boatload for free,

520
00:37:53,283 --> 00:37:56,416
you expect me to pay to ship
their bodies home at cost?

521
00:37:57,084 --> 00:37:58,653
It's cheaper than a million
dollar raise, ain't it?

522
00:38:04,262 --> 00:38:07,031
Mr. Bohannon, you'll make an executive yet.

we're gathered under the eyes

527

to celebrate a life...

528
00:38:41,065 --> 00:38:43,699
And to mourn the death of one of our own,

529
00:38:45,401 --> 00:38:49,669
tragically taken from us in the wilds
of California where we now reside.

530
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,040
Brothers,

531
00:38:58,378 --> 00:39:00,045
we are far from home.

Far from our friends and loved ones.
